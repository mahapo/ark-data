Entries that have more than one word in the heading are alphabetized as if there were no space between the words. Entries that share the same main heading are in the order of people, places and things. Entries beginning with numerals are treated as if the numerals were spelled out (e.g. 3C follows three-body problem and precedes 3C 273 ). An exception is made for HI r egion and HII region , which appear together immediately after Hirayama family . Biographies are alphabetized by surname, with first names following the comma. (Forenames are placed in parentheses if the one by which a person is commonly known is not the first.) Certain lunar and planetary features appear under the main element of names (e.g. Imbrium, Mare rather than Mare Imbrium). Cross-references SMALL CAPITALS in an article indicate a separate entry that defines and explains the w ord or subject capitalized. ‘ See also ’ at the end of an article directs the reader to entries that contain additional relevant information. Measurements Measurements are given in metric (usually SI) units, with an imperial conversion (to an appropriate accuracy) following in parentheses where appropriate. In historical contexts this convention is reversed so that, for example, the diameter of an early tele- scope is given first in inches. Densities, given in grams per cubic centimetre, are not converted, and neither are kilograms or tonnes. Large astronomical distances are usu- ally given in light-years, but parsecs are sometimes used in a cosmological context. Pa r ticularly in tables, large numbers may be given in exponential form. Thus 10 3 is a thousand, 2 \u0001 10 6 is two million, and so on. ‘Billion’ always means a thousand million, or 10 9 . As is customary in astronomy, dates are expressed in the order year, month, day. Details of units of measurement, conversion factors and the principal abbrevia- tions used in the book will be found in the tables on this page. Stellar data In almost all cases, data for stars are taken from the HIPPARCOS CATALOGUE . The very few exceptions are for instances where the catalogue contains an error of which the editors have been aware. In tables of constellations and elsewhere, the combined mag- nitude is given for double stars, and the average magnitude for variable stars.

On the one hand, profound truths have tumbled abundantly from the sky. Here are four diverse examples: 1. Our universe began some 14 billion years ago in a single cataclysmic event called the Big Bang. 2. Galaxies reside mainly in huge weblike ensembles. 3. Our neighbouring planets and their satellites come in a bewildering variety. 4. Earth itself is threatened (at least within politicians’ horizons) by impacts from mean-spirited asteroids or comets. On the other hand, ordinary citizens may well feel that astronomers are a confused lot and that they are farther away than ever from understanding how the universe is put together and how it works. For example, ‘yesterday’ we were told the universe is expanding as a consequence of the Big Bang; ‘today’ we are told it is accelerating due to some mysterious and possibly unrelated force. It doesn’t help that the media dine exclusively on ‘gee-whiz’ results, many of them contradictory and too often reported without historical context. I can’t help but savour the pre-1960s era, before quasars and pulsars were discovered, when we naïvely envisioned a simple, orderly universe understandable in everyday terms. Of course, all the new revelations cry out for insightful interpretation. And that’s why I’m delighted to introduce this brand-new edition. So much has been discovered since it first appeared in 1987 . . . so much more needs to be explained! It’s sobering to catalogue some of the objects and phenomena that were unknown, or at least weren’t much on astronomers’ minds, only a generation or two ago. The one that strikes me most is that 90% (maybe 99%!) of all the matter in the universe is invisible and therefore unknown. We ’ re sure it exists and is pervasive throughout intergalactic space (which was once thought to be a vacuum) because we can detect its gravitational influence on the stuff we can see, such as galaxies. But no one has a cogent clue as to what this so-called dark matter might be. Masers, first created in laboratories in 1953, were found in space only 12 years later. These intense emitters of coherent microwave radiation have enabled astronomers to vastly improve distance determinations to giant molecular clouds and, especially, to the centre of our Galaxy. A scientific ‘war’ was fought in the 1960s as to whether clusters of galaxies themselves clustered. Now even the biggest of these so- called superclusters are known to be but bricks in gigantic walls stretching across hundreds of millions of light-years. These walls contain most of the universe’s visible matter and are separated from each other by empty regions called voids. The discovery of quasars in 1963 moved highly condensed matter on to astronomy’s centre stage. To explain their enormous and rapidly varying energy output, a tiny source was needed, and only a black hole having a feeding frenzy could fill the bill. Thus too was born the whole subdiscipline of relativistic astrophysics, which continues to thrive. Quasars are now regarded as having the highest energies in a diverse class called active galaxies. Gamma-ray bursts, the most powerful outpourings of energy known in the universe, only came under intense scrutiny by astronomers in the 1990s (they had been detected by secret military satellites since the 1960s). The mechanism that leads to this prodigious output is still speculative, though a young, very massive star collapsing to form a black hole seems favoured. A decades-long quest for extrasolar planets and closely related brown-dwarf (failed) stars came to an abrupt end in 1995 when the first secure examples of both entities were found. (By a somewhat arbitrary convention, planets are regarded as having masses up to several times that of Jupiter; brown dwarfs range from about 10 to 80 Jupiters.) Improved search strategies and techniques are now discovering so many of both objects that ordinary new ones hardly make news. One of the greatest successes of astrophysics in the last century w as the identification of how chemical elements are born. Hydrogen, helium, and traces of others originated in the Big Bang; heavier elements through iron derive from the cores of stars; and still heavier elements are blasted into space by the explosions of ve ry massive stars. The discovery of pulsars in 1967 confirmed that neutron stars exist. Born in supernova explosions, these bodies are only about 10 kilometres across and spin around as rapidly as 100 times a second. Whenever a pulsar’s radiation beam, ‘focused’ by some of the strongest magnetic fields known, sweeps over the Earth, we see the pulse. In addition to being almost perfect clocks, pulsars have allowed studies as diverse as the interstellar medium and relativistic effects. Finally, unlike any other astronomical object, pulsars have yielded three Nobel Prizes! T antalizing though inconclusive evidence for extraterrestrial life accumulates impressively: possible fossil evidence in the famous Martian meteorite ALH 84001, the prospect of clement oceans under the icy crust of Jupiter’s satellite Europa, and the organic- compound rich atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan. And then there is the burgeoning catalogue of planets around other stars and the detection of terrestrial life forms in ever more hostile environments. All this suggests that we may not be alone. On a higher plane, despite many efforts to find extraterrestrial intelligence since Frank Drake’s famous Ozma experiment in 1960, we haven’t picked up E.T.’s phone call yet. But the search has barely begun. The flowering of astrophysics stems from the development of ever larger, ever more capable telescopes on the ground and in space. All the electromagnetic spectrum – from the highest-energy gamma rays to the lowest-energy radio waves – is now available for robust scrutiny, not just visible light and long-wavelength radio emission as was the case in as recently as the 1950s. Equally impressive has been the development of detectors to capture celestial radiation more efficiently. In the case of the CCD (charge-coupled device), trickle-down technology has allowed small amateur telescopes to act as though they were four or five times larger. Augmented by effective software, CCDs have caused a revolution among hobbyists, who, after nearly a century-long hiatus, can once again contribute to mainstream astrophysical research. Increasingly, astronomers are no longer limited to gathering electromagnetic radiation. Beginning late in the last century, they started to routinely sample neutrinos, elementary particles that allow us to peek at such inaccessible things as the earliest times in the life of the universe and the innards of exploding stars. And the gr a vitational-wave detectors being commissioned at the time of this writing should allow glimpses of the fabric of spacetime itself. Astronomy has involved extensive international collaborations for well over a century. The cross-disciplinary nature of contemporary research makes such collaborations even more compelling in the future. Furthermore, efforts to build the next generation of instruments on the ground and especially in space are so expensive that their funding will demand international participation. Where do astronomers go from here? ‘Towards the unknown’ may seem like a cliché, but it isn’t. With so much of the universe invisible or unsampled, there simply have to be many enormous surprises awaiting! When it comes to the Big Questions, I don’t know whether we are children unable to frame our thoughts, or teenagers at sea, or adults awash in obfuscating information. Researchers find the plethora of new discoveries – despite myriad loose ends and conundrums – to be very exciting, for it attests to the vibrancy and maturation of the science. Yet, as we enter the 21st century, astronomers are still a very long way from answering the two most common and profound questions people ask: what kind of universe do we live in, and is life pervasive?

He was director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory from 1907. Abbot made a very accurate determination of the solar constant, compiled the first accurate map of the Sun’s infrared spectrum and studied the heating effect of the solar corona. He helped to design Mount Wilson Solar Observatory’s 63-ft (19-m) vertical solar telescope. Abell, George Ogden (1927–83) American astronomer who studied galaxies and clusters of galaxies. He is best known for his catalogue of 2712 ‘rich’ clusters of galaxies (1958), drawn largely from his work on the P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY SKY SURVEY . The Abell clusters, some of which are 3 billion l.y. distant, are important because they define the Universe’s large-scale structure. Abell successfully calculated the size and mass of many of these clusters, finding that at least 90% of the mass necessary to keep them from flying apart must be invisible. aberration (1) (aberration of starlight) Apparent displacement of the observed position of a star from its true position in the sky, caused by a combination of the Earth’s motion through space and the finite velocity of the light arriving from the star. The effect was discovered by J ames BRADLEY in 1728 while he was attempting to measure the P ARALLAX of nearby stars. His observations revealed that the apparent position of all objects shifted back and forth annually by up to 20 \u0001 in a way that was not connected to the expected parallax effect. The Earth’s movement in space comprises two parts: its orbital motion around the Sun at an average speed of 29.8 km/s (18.5 mi/s), which causes annual aberration , and its daily rotation, which is responsible for the smaller of the two components, diurnal aberration . The former causes a star’s apparent position to describe an ELLIPSE ov er the course of a year. For any star on the ECLIPTIC , this ellipse is flattened into a straight line, whereas a star at the pole of the ecliptic describes a circle. The angular dis- placement of the star, \u0002 , is calculated from the formula tan \u0002 = v / c , where v is the Earth’s orbital velocity and c is the speed of light. Diurnal aberration is dependent on the observer’s posi- tion on the surface of the Earth. Its effect is maximized at the equator, where it produces a displacement of a stellar position of 0 \u0001 .32 to the east, but drops to zero for an observer at the poles. Bradley’s observations demonstrated both the motion of the Earth in space and the finite speed of light; they have influenced arguments in cosmology to the present day. aberration (2) Defect in an image produced by a LENS or MIRROR . Six primary forms of aberration affect the quality of image produced by an optical system. One of these, CHROMATIC ABERRATION , is due to the different amount of refraction experienced by different wa v elengths of light when passing through the boundary between two transparent materials; the other five are independent of colour and arise from the limitations of the geometry of the optical surfaces. They are sometimes referred to as Seidel aberrations after Ludwig v on Seidel (1821–96), the mathematician who investigated them in detail. The five Seidel aberrations are SPHERICAL ABERRATION , COMA , ASTIGMATISM , curvature and distortion. All but spherical aberration are caused when light passes through the optics at an angle to the optical axis. Optical designers strive to reduce or eliminate aberrations and combine lens- es of different glass types, thickness and shape to produce a ‘corrected lens’. Examples are the composite OBJECTIVES in astronomical refractors and composite EYEPIECES . Curvature produces images that are not flat. When projected on to a flat surface, such as a photographic film, the image may be in focus in the centre or at the edges, b ut not at both at the same time. Astronomers using CCD cameras on telescopes can use a field flattener to produce a well-focused image across the whole field of view. Often this is combined with a focal reducer to provide a wider field of view. Distortion occurs where the shape of the resulting image is changed. Common types of distortion are pin- cushion and barrel distortion, which describe the effects seen when an image of a rectangle is formed. Some binoc- ular manufacturers deliberately introduce a small amount of pin-cushion distortion as they claim it produces a more natural experience when the binoculars are panned across a scene. Measuring the distortion in a telescope is extremely important for ASTROMETRY as it affects the pre- cise position measurements being undertaken. Astromet- r ic telescopes once calibrated are maintained in as stable a condition as possible to avoid changing the distortion. Abetti, Giorgio (1882–1982) Italian solar physicist, director of ARCETRI ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY (1921–52). As a young postgraduate he worked at Mount Wilson Observatory, where pioneering solar astronomer George Ellery HALE became his mentor. Abetti designed and constructed the Arcetri solar tower, at the time the best solar telescope in Europe, and used it to investigate the structure of the chromosphere and the motion of sunspot penumbras (the Evershed–Abetti effect). ablation Process by which the surface layers of an object entering the atmosphere (for example a spacecraft or a METEOROID ) are removed through the rapid intense heating caused by frictional contact with the air. The heat shields of space vehicles have outer layers that ablate, preventing overheating of the spacecraft’s interior. absolute magnitude ( M ) Visual magnitude that a star w ould have at a standard distance of 10 P ARSECS .

Bending of the light path away from the optical axis produces coma, drawing the star image into a ‘tail’ (3).

The zero point of the scale is ABSOLUTE ZERO , and the freezing and boiling points of water are 273.15ºA and 373.15ºA, respectively. 1ºA is equivalent to 1 K and kelvins are now the accepted SI unit. See also CELSIUS SCALE absolute zero Lowest theoretically attainable temperature; it is equivalent to \u0001 273.15ºC or 0 K. Absolute zero is the temperature at which the motion of a toms and molecules is the minimum possible, although that motion never ceases completely because of the operation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. (This principle states that an object does not have a measurable position and momentum at the same time, because the act of measuring disturbs the system.) Absolute zero can never be achieved in practice, but temperatures down to 0.001 K or less can be reached in the laboratory. The COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND means that 2.7 K is the minimum temperature found naturally in the Universe. absorption As a beam of light, or other ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION , travels through any material medium, the intensity of the beam in the direction of travel gradually diminishes. This is partly due to scattering by particles of the medium and partly due to absorption within the medium. Energy that is absorbed in this way may subsequently be re-radiated at the same or longer wavelength and may cause a rise in temperature of the medium. The absorption process may be general or selective in the way that it affects different wavelengths. Examples can be seen in the colours of various substances. Lamp black, or amorphous carbon, absorbs all wavelengths equally and reflects very little, whereas paints and pig- ments absorb all but the few wavelengths that give them their characteristic colours. Spectral analysis of starlight reveals the selective absorp- tion processes that tell us so much about the chemical and physical conditions involved. The core of a star is a hot, incandescent, high-pressure gas, which produces a CON - TINUOUS SPECTRUM . The atoms of stellar material are excited by this high-temperature environment and are so close together that their electrons move easily from atom to a tom, emitting energy and then being re-excited and so on. This gives rise to energy changes of all possible levels releasing all possible colours in the continuous SPECTRUM . The cooler, low-pressure material that comprises the a tmospheres of both star and Earth, and the interstellar medium that lies between them, can be excited by con- stituents of this continuous radiation from the star core, thus absorbing some of the radiation. Such selective absorption produces the dark ABSORPTION LINES that are so typical of stellar spectra. These lines are not totally black; they are merely fainter than the continuum because only a fraction of the absorbed energy is re-radiated in the original direction. See also FRAUNHOFER LINES ; MOR - GAN – KEENAN CLASSIFICATION absorption line Break or depression in an otherwise CONTINUOUS SPECTRUM . An ABSORPTION line is caused by the absorption of photons within a specific (usually narrow) band of wavelengths by some species of atom, ion or molecule, any of which has its own characteristic set of absorptions. Absorption lines are produced when electrons associated with the various species absorb incoming radiation and jump to higher energy levels. The analysis of absorption lines allows the determination of stellar parameters such as temperatures, densities, surface gr a vities, velocities and chemical compositions ( see SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION ). absorption nebula See D ARK NEBULA Abu’l-Wafa ̄’ al Bu ̄zja ̄nı ̄, Muhammad (940–997/8) Pe r sian astronomer and mathematician.

Acamar The star \u0002 Eridani, visual mag. 2.88, distance 161 l.y. Through small telescopes it is seen to be double. The components are of mags. 3.2 and 4.3, with spectral types A5 IV and A1 Va. The name comes from the Arabic akhir al-nahr , meaning ‘river’s end’, for in ancient times it marked the southernmost end of Eridanus, before the constellation was extended farther south to ACHE RNAR . acapulcoite–lodranite Association of two groups of A CHONDRITE meteorites. They show a range of properties that grade into each other, with similar oxygen isotopic compositions. Acapulcoite–lodranites are thought to be partial melts of chondritic precursors. They have been described as primitive achondrites, suggesting that they are a bridge between CHONDRITES and achondrites. acceleration of free fall Acceleration experienced by a body falling freely in a gravitational field. A body in free fall follows a path determined only by the combination of its velocity and gravitational acceleration. This path may be a straight line, circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola. A freely falling body experiences no sensation of weight, hence the ‘weightlessness’ of astronauts, since the spacecraft is continuously free falling towards the Earth while its transverse motion ensures that it gets no closer. The free fall acceleration is 9.807 m/s 2 at the Earth’s surface. It varies as the inverse square of the distance from the Earth’s centre. accretion Process by which bodies gain mass; the term is applied both to the growth of solid objects by collisions that result in sticking and to the capture of gas by the gravity of a massive body. Both types of accretion are involved in the formation of a planetary system from a disk-shaped nebula surrounding a PROTOSTAR . When newly formed, such a disk consists mostly of gas, with a small fraction ( c .1%) of solid material in small dust particles, with original sizes of the order of a micrometre. Grains settle through the gas towards the central plane of the disk; they drift inwards toward the protostar at rates that vary with their sizes and densities, resulting in collisions at low velocities. Particles may stick together by several mechanisms, depending on their compositions and local conditions, including surface forces (van der Waals bonding), electrical or magnetic effects, adsorbed layers of organic molecules forming a ‘glue’, and partial melting of ices. This sticking produces irregularly shaped fluffy aggregates, which can grow further by mechanical interlocking. When bodies reach sizes of the order of a kilometre or larger, gravity becomes the dominant bonding mecha- nism. Such bodies are called PLANETESIMALS . Mutual perturbations cause their orbits to deviate from circulari- ty, allowing them to cross, which results in further colli- sions. The impact velocity is always at least as large as the escape velocity from the larger body. If the energy density exceeds the mechanical strength of the bodies, they are shattered. However, a large fraction of the impact energy is converted into heat, and most frag- ments move at relatively low velocities, less than the impact velocity. These fragments will fall back to the common centre of gravity, resulting in a net gain of mass unless the impact velocity greatly exceeds the escape v elocity. The fragments form a rubble pile held together by their mutual gravity. As this process is repeated, bod- ies grow ever larger. At sizes greater than a few hundred kilometres gravitational binding exceeds the strength of geological materials, and the mechanical properties of the planetesimals become unimportant. Accretion is stochastic, that is, the number of colli- sions experienced by a body of a given size in an interval absolute zero 2 A A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:03 pm Page 2"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"achromat of time is a matter of chance. This process produces a distribution of bodies of various sizes. Often, the size dis- tribution can be described by a power law, with an index s , defined so that the number of objects more massive than a specific mass, m , is proportional to m \u0001 s . If s is less than 1, most of the mass is in the larger objects; for larg- er values of s , the smaller bodies comprise most of the mass. Power law size distributions may be produced by either accretion or fragmentation, with the latter tending to have somewhat larger s v alues. However, accretion of planetesimals subject to gravitational forces can produce another type of distribution. If relative velocities are low compared with a body’s escape velocity, its gravity can deflect the trajectories of other objects, causing impacts for encounters that would otherwise be near misses. This ‘gravitational focusing’ is more effective for more mas- sive bodies, and it increases their rate of mass gain by accretion, allowing the largest bodies to grow still more rapidly. In numerical simulations of accretion, the first body to reach a size such that its escape velocity exceeds the mean relative velocity experiences ‘runaway growth’, quickly becoming much larger than the mean size. Its o wn perturbations then stir up velocities of the smaller bodies near its orbit, preventing them from growing in the same manner. At greater distances, its effects are w eaker, and the process can repeat in another location. The result is a series of PROTOPLANETS in separated orbits; these can grow further by sweeping up the resid- ual population of small planetesimals. In the inner Solar System, the final stage of accretion probably involved collisions between protoplanets. Impacts of this magnitude would have involved enough energy to melt the planets; such an event is theorized to be responsible for the origin of the Moon. If a protoplan- et attained sufficient mass before dissipation of the SOLAR NEBULA , then its gravitation could overcome the pressure of the nebular gas, and it could accrete gas from the nebula. This process can begin at a critical mass that depends on a number of factors, including the density and temperature of the gas, and the protoplanet’s dis- tance from the Sun. The rate at which gas is accreted is limited by the escape of energy, which must be radiated aw ay by the gas as it cools. The original protoplanet w ould then become the CORE of a planet that consists mostly of hydrogen. Plausible estimates imply that the critical mass is at least a few times Earth’s mass, but pro- toplanets of this size could have accreted in the outer Solar System. Jupiter and Saturn probably formed by accretion of gas. See also COSMOGONY accretion disk Disk of matter that surrounds an astronomical object and through which material is transferred to that object. In many circumstances, material does not transfer directly from one astronomical object to another. Instead, the material is pulled into equatorial orbit about the object before accreting. Such material transfer systems are known as A CCRETION disks. Accretion disks occur in protostellar clouds, close BINARY STAR systems and at the centre of galaxies. Accretion disks are difficult to observe directly because of their small size or large distance from Earth. The disks that appear the largest (because they are near- est) are PROTOPLANETARY DISKS , around 100 AU in size, some of which have been imaged by the Hubble Space T elescope. Accretion disks in CLOSE BINARIES range in diameter from a few tenths to a few solar radii. Details about size, thickness and temperature of accretion disks can be provided by observing eclipses occurring between the disk and the secondary star from which the material is being pulled. The energy output of the material being accreted depends on the mass and radius of the accreting object. The more massive and the smaller the accreting object, the higher the speed of material arriving, and the greater the amount of energy released on impact. Energy contin- ues to be radiated as the material loses energy by slowing down within the disk. If the accreting star in a binary sys- tem is a WHITE DWARF , as in a CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE , the inner part of the disk will radiate in the ultraviolet, while the outer part radiates mostly in the visible. The MASS TRANSFER in such systems is often unstable, caus- ing DW ARF NOVAE outbursts. In an X - RAY BINARY the accreting star is a NEUTRON STAR or stellar-mass BLACK HOLE and the inner disk radi- a tes in X-rays. Unstable mass transfer across these disks produces soft X - RAY TRANSIENTS and sometimes relativis- tic JETS . The greatest amounts of energy are released when matter accretes on to a SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE at the centre of a galaxy. This is the power source of an A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS , the central region of which radiates in ultraviolet and X-ray and can produce relativistic jets.

Achondrites usually have differentiated compositions. They generally do not contain CHONDRULES , and they have very low metal contents.

The separate associations have little, if any, genetic relationship to each other.

This INFRARED RADIATION w as further investigated by his son Sir John HERSCHEL , who invented the actinometer around 1825. active galactic nucleus (AGN) Central energy- producing region in some GALAXIES . AGNs are distinct in having substantial portions of their energy output coming from processes that are not associated with normal stars and their evolution. The observed guises of this energy release define the various types of active nuclei. At the lowest power levels are LINERS (Low Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions), generally recognized only by the ratios of fairly weak EMISSION LINES ; not all LINERS are genuine active nuclei. Activity character- ized by strong, broad emission lines occurs in SEYFERT GALAXIES , most of which are spirals; Seyfert types 1 and 2 have different patterns of line width. Seyfert galaxies also show strong X-ray emission and, often, far-infrared radiation. RADIO GALAXIES are most notable for their strong radio emission, usually from a pair of lobes sym- metrically placed about the galaxy, often accompanied by JETS and radio emission from the nucleus itself. This activity may have little or no trace in the optical region, although some radio galaxies do have spectacular optical emission lines similar to those of both types of Seyfert galaxy. Higher-luminosity objects are QU ASISTELLAR OBJECTS (QSOs), which are known as QU ASARS (quasi- stellar radio sources) if they exhibit strong radio emis- sion. These objects are so bright that the surrounding galaxy can be lost for ordinary observations in the light of the nucleus. Members of another class, BL LACERTAE OBJECTS , show featureless spectra and rapid variability, suggesting that they are radio galaxies or quasars seen along the direction of a relativistic jet, the radiation of which is strongly beamed along its motion. These cate- gories share features of strong X-ray emission, large v elocities for the gas seen in emission lines, and a very small emitting region as seen from variability. Many show variation in the ultraviolet and X-ray bands on scales of hours to days, implying that the radiation is emitted in a region with light-crossing time no longer than these times. The most popular model for energy production in all these kinds of active galactic nuclei involves material around a supermassive BLACK HOLE (of millions to a few thousand million solar masses). The power is released during A CCRETION , likely in an A CCRETION DISK , while jets may be a natural by-product of the disk geometry and magnetic fields. active optics T echnique for controlling the shape and alignment of the primary MIRROR of a large reflecting TELESCOPE . As a telescope tilts to track the path of a celestial object across the sky, its mirror is subject to changes in the forces acting upon it, as well as temperature variations and buffeting from the wind, which can cause it to flex, giving rise to SPHERICAL ABERRATION or ASTIGMATISM of the image. Active optics compensate for these effects, through the use of a number of computer-controlled motorized mirror supports, known as actuators, which continually monitor the shape of the mirror and adjust it into its cor- rect form. These adjustments are typically only about 1/10,000 the thickness of a human hair but are enough to keep light from a star or galaxy precisely focused. F or many years it was considered impossible to build telescopes of the order of eight metres in diameter using a single mirror because it would have had to be so thick and heavy in order to maintain its correct shape as to make it impractical. The development of active optics technology has meant that relatively thin primary mir- rors can now be built that are lighter and cheaper and are able to hold their precise shape, thereby optimizing image quality. The system also compensates for any imperfections in the surface of the mirror caused by minor manufacturing errors. See also ADAPTIVE OPTICS ; SEGMENTED MIRROR active region Region of enhanced magnetic activity on the Sun often, but not always, associated with SUNSPOTS and extending from the solar PHOTOSPHERE to the CORONA . Where sunspots occur, they are connected by strong magnetic fields that loop through the CHROMOSPHERE into the low corona (coronal loops). Radio, ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from active regions is enhanced relative to neighbouring regions of the chromosphere and corona. Active regions may last from several hours to a few months. They are the sites of intense explosions, FLARES , which last from a few minutes to hours. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), which monitors solar activity, assigns numbers to active regions (for example, AR 9693) in order of their visibility or appearance. The occurrence and location of active regions varies in step with the approximately 11-year SOLAR CYCLE . Loops of gas seen as FILAMENTS or PROMINENCES are often suspended in magnetic fields above active regions. Adams, John Couch (1819–92) English mathematician and astronomer who played a part in the discovery of Neptune. In 1844, while at St John’s College, Cambridge, he began to investigate the orbital irregularities of Uranus, which he concluded could be accounted for by gravitational perturbations by an undiscovered planet. He calculated an orbit for this planet, and identified a small region of sky where it might be found. He approached James CHALLIS , director of the Cambridge Observatory, and George Biddell AIRY , the Astronomer Royal.

When the Uranus- disturbing planet, Neptune, was located on 1846 September 23, it was by Johann GALLE and Henrich D ’ ARREST , observing from Berlin and guided by a position calculated independently by Urbain LE VERRIER . Adams was a brilliant scientist, but shy and rather retir- ing, and he refused a knighthood in 1847. He returned to Cambridge as Lowndean Professor in 1858, becoming director of the Cambridge Observatory in 1860. Adams’ subsequent researches on the lunar parallax and other small motions, and the celestial mechanics of meteor streams following the 1866 Leonid storm, won him numerous honours. In spite of the Neptune affair, which led to arguments over the conduct of British science and a souring of Anglo-French scientific relations, Adams enjoyed the friendship of Airy, Challis and Le Verrier. Adams, Walter Sydney, Jr (1876–1956) American astronomer, born in Syria to missionary parents, who succeeded George Ellery HALE as director of Mount Wilson Observatory (1923–46). At Yerkes Observatory (1898–1904), Adams became an expert at using spectroscopic techniques to determine stellar radial ve locities. He followed Hale to Mount Wilson, where a g reat new observatory specializing in solar astronomy w as being built. Adams and Hale obtained solar spectra showing that sunspots were cooler than the rest of the Sun’s surface, and by measuring Doppler shifts in solar spectra he was able accurately to measure our star’s differential rotation, which varies with latitude. In 1914 he began studying the intensity of spectral lines of stars beyond the Sun, which could be used to calculate the stars’ absolute magnitudes; during his Mount Wilson y ears, Adams computed and catalogued the radial v elocities of 7000 stars, determining the absolute magnitudes of another 6000. Adams discovered that the intensities differed for main-sequence, giant and dwarf stars, and used this knowledge to identify Sirius B as the first example (1915) of a white dwarf. His calculations showed that Sirius B is an extremely hot, compact star containing 80% of the Sun’s mass packed into a volume roughly equal to that of the Earth. Ten years later he was able to measure a Doppler shift of 21 km/s (13 mi/s) for Sirius B, a result predicted by Arthur EDDINGTON ’s model of white dwarfs, which, because they are very dense, produce powerful localized gravitational fields manifested in just such a spectral redshift. Adams’ discovery was therefore regard- ed as an astrophysical confirmation of Albert EINSTEIN ’s theory of general relativity. In 1932 Adams found that the a tmosphere of Venus is largely composed of CO 2 ; he also discovered that the interstellar medium contained the molecules CN and CH. The climax of Adams’ career w as his role in the design and building of Mount Palo- mar’s 200-inch (5-m) Hale Telescope. adaptive optics T echnique that compensates for distortion caused in astronomical images by the effects of a tmospheric turbulence, or poor SEEING . Adaptive optic technology uses a very thin, deformable mirror to correct for the distorting effects of atmospheric turbulence. It operates by sampling the light using an instrument called a wavefront sensor. This takes a ‘snap- shot’ of the image from a star or galaxy many times a sec- ond and sends a signal back to the deformable mirror, which is placed just in front of the focus of the telescope. The mirror is very thin and can be flexed in a controlled fashion hundreds of times a second, compensating for the va r ying distortion and producing an image almost as sharp as if the telescope were in space. The control signals must be sent from the wavefront detector to the mirror fast enough so that the turbulence has not changed signif- icantly between sensing and correction.

The name comes from an Arabic phrase meaning ‘the virgins’, given to an asterism of four of five stars of which Adhara was the brightest. adiabatic Process in thermodynamics in which a change in a system occurs without transfer of heat to or from the environment. Material within the convective regions of stars moves sufficiently rapidly that there is little exchange of energy except at the top and bottom of the region. The material therefore undergoes adiabatic changes, and this leads to a simple pressure law of the form: P = k \u0002 5/3 where P is the pressure, \u0002 the density, and k a constant. Such a pressure law is called polytropic, and it enables the region to be modelled very simply. Adonis Second APOLLO ASTEROID to be discovered, in 1936. It was lost but became numbered as 2101 after its recovery in 1977. Because of its low inclination orbit, Adonis makes frequent close approaches to the Earth. It has been suggested to be the parent of a minor METEOR SHOWER , the Capricornid–Sagittariids, and may, therefore, have originated as a cometary nucleus.

On Earth, this region is rather inaccessible, being generally above the height that meteorological balloons can reach, so research techniques rely heavily on the use of rockets and satellites together with remote sensing by radio wa v es and optical techniques. The primary source of energy for the processes inves- tigated is incident solar energy absorbed before it reaches the surface of the planet. This energy may ionize the upper atmosphere to form ionospheric plasma or may cause chemical changes, such as the photodissociation of molecules to form atoms or the production of exotic molecules such as ozone and nitrous oxide. Some minor constituents have an important catalytic role in the chemistry of the upper atmosphere, hence, for example, the significant influence of chlorine compounds on the ozone concentration in the STRATOSPHERE . Consideration of the atmosphere as a fluid leads to an understanding of the various winds and circulation pat- terns. Fluid oscillations include atmospheric tides, inter- nal gravity waves and disturbances that propagate because of buoyancy forces.

Aglaonike Ancient Greek, the first woman named in the recorded history of astronomy. She was said to have predicted eclipses, and some of her contemporaries regarded her as a ‘sorceress’ who could ‘make the Moon disappear at will’. AGN Abbreviation for A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS airglow Ever-present faint, diffuse background of light in the night sky resulting from re-emission of energy by a tmospheric atoms and molecules following excitation during daylight by solar radiation. Airglow emissions, which occur in the upper A TMOSPHERE , mean that Earth’s night sky is never completely dark. Prominent among airglow emissions is green light from excited oxygen, at 557.7 nm wavelength, which is found mainly in a roughly 10 km (6 mi) deep layer at around 100 km (60 mi) altitude. Red oxygen emissions at 630.0 nm and 636.4 nm occur higher in the atmosphere; together with those from sodium, these emissions become more prominent in the twilight airglow. The night-time airglow varies in brightness, probably in response to changing geomagnetic activity. The day-time airglow is about a thousand times more intense than that seen at night but is, of course, a great deal more difficult to study because of the bright sky background. Airy, George Biddell (1801–92) English astronomer, the seventh ASTRONOMER ROYAL . The son of an excise officer, he grew up in Suffolk and won a scholarship to Tr inity College, Cambridge. Airy became a professor at the age of 26, and was offered the post of Astronomer Royal in 1835, having already refused a knighthood on the grounds of his relative poverty. (He turned down two further offers, before finally accepting a knighthood in 1872.) Academic astronomy in Airy’s day was dominated by celestial mechanics. Astronomers across Europe, especially in Germany, were making meticulous observations of the meridional positions of the stars and planets for the construction of accurate tables. These tables provided the basis for all sorts of investigations in celestial mechanics to be able to take place. As a Cambridge astronomy professor and then as Astronomer Royal at Greenwich, Airy was to be involved in such research for 60 years. In addition to such mathematical investigations, Airy w as a very practical scientist, who used his mathematical knowledge to improve astronomical instrument design, data analysis, and civil and mechanical engineering. Upon assuming office as Astronomer Royal he began a fundamental reorganization of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. He did little actual observing himself, but developed a highly organized staff to do the routine busi- ness, leaving him free for analytical, navigational and government scientific work. Airy was quick to seize the potential of new science-based techniques such as elec- tric telegraphy, and by 1854, for instance, the Observa- tory was transmitting time signals over the expanding railway telegraph network. It is sad that in the popular mind Airy is perhaps best remembered as the man who failed to enable John Couch ADAMS to secure priority in the discovery of Nep- tune in 1846. Yet this stemmed in no small degree from Adams’ own failure to communicate with Airy and to answer Airy’s technical questions. Airy made no single g reat discovery, but he showed his generation how astronomy could be made to serve the public good. Airy disk Central spot in the DIFFRACTION pattern of the image of a star at the focus of a telescope. In theory 84% of the star’s light is concentrated into this disk, the remainder being distributed into the set of concentric circles around it. The size of the Airy disk is determined by the APERTURE of the telescope. It limits the RESOLUTION that can be achieved. The larger the aperture, the smaller the Airy disk and the higher the resolution that is possible. aeronomy 6 A \u0001 Agena The Agena target vehicle is seen here from Gemini 8 during the r endezvous.

A massive pyramid-shaped mountain and many bowl craters mark the central floor. al-Batta ̄nı ̄, Abu’Abdullah Muhammad ibn Ja ̄ bir (Latinized as Albategnius ) ( c .858–929) Arab observational astronomer (born in what is now modern Turkey) who demonstrated that the Sun’s distance from the Earth, and therefore its apparent angular size, varies, which explains why both total and annular solar eclipses are possible. He made the first truly accurate calculations of the solar (tropical) year (365.24056 days), the ecliptic’s inclination to the celestial equator (23° 35 \u0001 ) and the precession of the equinoxes (54 \u0002 .5 per year). albedo Measure of the reflecting power of the surface of a non-luminous body. Defined as the ratio of the amount of light reflected by a body to the total amount falling on it, albedo values range from 0 for a perfectly absorbing black surface, to 1 for a perfect reflector or white surface. Albedo is commonly used in astronomy to describe the fraction of sunlight reflected by planets, satellites and asteroids: rocky bodies have low values whereas those covered with clouds or comprising a high percentage of water-ice have high values. The average albedo of the MOON , for example, is just 0.07 whereas VENUS , which is covered in dense clouds, has a value of 0.76, the highest in the Solar System. The albedo of an object can provide valuable information about the composition and structure of its surface, while the combination of an object’s albedo, size and distance determines its overall brightness. Albert One of the AMOR ASTEROIDS ; number 719. It is c .3 km ( c .2 mi) in size. Albert was an anomaly for many decades in that it was numbered and named after its discovery in 1911 but subsequently lost. Despite many attempts to recover it, Albert escaped repeated detection until the year 2000. Albireo The star \u0003 Cygni, visual mag. 3.05, distance 386 l.y. Albireo is a beautiful double star of contrasting colours. It comprises an orange giant (the brighter component, spectral type K3 II) twinned with a companion of mag. 5.1 and spectral type B9.5 V which appears greenish-blue. The two are so widely spaced, by about 34 \u0002 , that they can be seen separately through the smallest of telescopes, and even with good binoculars (if firmly mounted). The name Albireo is a medieval corruption, and is meaningless. al-Bu ̄zja ̄nı ̄ See ABU ’ L - WA FA ̄’ AL BU ̄ ZJA ̄ NI ̄, MUHAMMAD Alcor The star 80 Ursae Majoris, visual mag. 3.99, distance 81 l.y., spectral type A5 V. Alcor is a spectroscopic binary, though no accurate data are known. The name may comes from an Arabic word meaning ‘rider’. Alcor forms a naked-eye double with MIZAR ; the two are not a genuine binary, but Alcor is part of the URSA MAJOR MOVING CLUSTER . Alcyone The star \u0004 Tauri, distance 368 l.y., spectral type B7 III. At visual mag. 2.85, it is the brightest member of the PLEIADES star cluster. In Greek mythology, Alcyone was one of the seven daughters of Atlas and Pleione. Aldebaran The star \u0005 Tauri, visual mag. 0.87 (but slightly variable), distance 65 l.y. It is an orange- coloured giant of spectral type K5 III. It marks the eye of Taurus, the bull. Its true luminosity is about 150 times that of the Sun. Although Aldebaran appears to be a member of the V-shaped Hyades cluster, it is a foreground object at about half the distance, superimposed by chance. The name comes from the 7 A \u0001 Airy, George Biddell Portrait in ink of controversial 19th-century Astronomer Royal George Biddell Airy. \u0002 albedo This albedo map of Mars was produced by NASA’s Mars Global Surveyor.

Alfvén, Hannes Olof Gösta (1908–95) Swedish physicist who developed much of the theory of MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS , for which he was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize for Physics. In 1942 he predicted the existence of what are now called ALFVÉN WAVES , which propagate through a plasma, and in 1950 he identified synchrotron radiation from cosmic sources, helping to establish radio astronomy. Alfvén waves T ransverse MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC wa v es that can occur in a region containing plasma and a magnetic field. The electrically conducting plasma is linked to and moves with the magnetic field. Sometimes this phenomenon is referred to as the plasma and magnetic field being ‘frozen-in’ to each other. The plasma follows the oscillations of the magnetic field and modifies those oscillations. Alfvén waves may transfer energy out to the solar CORONA , and they are also found in the SOLAR WIND and the Earth’s MAGNETOSPHERE . They are named after Hannes ALFVÉN . Algenib The star \u0002 P egasi, visual mag. 2.83, spectral type B2 IV, distance 333 l.y. It is a BETA CEPHEI STAR – a pulsating variable that fluctuates by 0.1 mag. with a period of 3.6 hours. The name Algenib comes from the Arabic meaning ‘the side’; it is also an alternative name for the star \u0001 Pe r sei ( see MIRPHAK ). Algieba The star \u0002 Leonis, visual mag. 2.01, distance 126 l.y. Small telescopes show it to be a beautiful double star with golden-yellow components of mags. 2.6 and 3.5, spectral types K1 III and G7 III. The pair form a genuine binary with an orbital period of nearly 620 y ears. The name may come from the Arabic al-jabha , meaning ‘the forehead’, referring to its position in a much larger figure of a lion visualized by Arab astronomers in this region. Algol P rototype of the ALGOL STARS , a subtype (EA) of ECLIPSING BINARY stars. It is now known, however, that Algol is somewhat atypical of its eponymous subtype. The first recorded observation of Algol was made by Geminiano MONTANARI in 1669. In 1782 John GOODRICKE established that Algol’s variability was period- ic, with a sudden fade occurring every 2.867 days. Gradu- ally, the concept of an eclipsing companion became accepted and was finally confirmed when, in 1889, Her- mann V OGEL showed that the radial velocity of Algol var- ied with the same period as that of the eclipses. By this time, Algol was known to be a triple system. In 1855 F.W.A. ARGELANDER had observed that the period between primary minima had shortened by six seconds since Goodricke’s observations. Fourteen years later he noted that the period between the times of minima varied in a regular fashion with a period of about 680 days. This w as attributed to the variation in the distance that the light from the system had to travel because of orbital motion around the common centre of gravity with a third star (Algol C). In 1906 the Russian astronomer Aristarkh Belopolski (1854–1934) confirmed the existence of Algol C by show- ing that radial-velocity variations in the spectral lines of Algol also had a period of 1.862 years superimposed on the period of 2.867 days for Algol AB. Several years later, Joel STEBBINS , a pioneer in stellar photometry, found that there w as a secondary minimum of much smaller amplitude occurring exactly halfway between the primary eclipses. This showed for the first time that the companion was not dark at all, but merely much fainter than A. Photoelectric observations showed the depth of the secondary minimum to be 0.06 mag. and that the light from star A increased as the secondary minimum approached. This was interpreted as a reflection of light from the body of star B. There are two stars, of spectral types B8 and G, rotat- ing about each other. The B8 star is a dwarf and is the vis- ible component. The fainter star (whose spectrum was only observed directly for the first time in 1978) is a sub- g iant. The orbit is inclined to the line of sight by 82º, which results in mutual eclipses corresponding to a drop in light of 1.3 mag. when A is eclipsed by B. Hipparcos data give a distance to Algol of 93 l.y. This corresponds to luminosities of 100 and 3 for A and B respectively. From the length and depth of the eclipses, sizes of 2.89 and 3.53 solar radii have been derived for A and B respectively. The corresponding masses are 3.6 and 2.89 solar masses, and this apparent anomaly gives rise to what is known as the ‘Algol paradox’. In current theories of STELLAR EVOLUTION , stars advance in spectral type as they evolve, and the rate at which they do so is a function of their initial masses. Thus, if two stars form together from interstellar materi- al, the more massive of the two should evolve more quickly. In Algol the more evolved star is the less massive and the cause seems to be MASS TRANSFER from B to A. A stream of material between the two stars has been detected in the radio observations, and the current trans- fer rate is thought to be at least 10 \u0003 7 solar masses per y ear. Optical spectra have shown very faint lines, which are thought to be emitted by a faint ring of material sur- rounding star A. Algol C was first resolved by speckle interferometry in 1974 and on several occasions since. Its angular separa- tion has never exceeded 0 \u0004 .1, which explains why the star has never been seen by visual observers. The real nature of the Algol system is still far from clear. Even after 200 years of continuous observation it still evokes considerable interest from astronomers. Algol stars (EA) One of the three main subtypes of ECLIPSING BINARY .

Secondary minima may be detectable, depending on the characteristics of the system. Outside eclipses, the light- curve is essentially flat, although it may exhibit a small, g radual increase and decrease around secondary minimum, which is caused by the reflection effect, where light from the bright ( MAIN SEQUENCE ) primary irradiates the surface of the cooler secondary, thus raising its temperature and luminosity. The components of the binary system may be DETACHED or, as in ALGOL itself, one component may be SEMIDETACHED . Systems in which the semidetached component is transferring mass to the non-evolved component are sometimes described as being ‘Algol-type’ or ‘Algol-like’ binaries. In the Algol-type binaries, the detached component is a main-sequence star and its less-massive companion is a red SUBGIANT that fills its R OCHE LOBE . Such systems are differentiated physically from the closely related BETA L YRAE STARS by the fact that an A CCRETION DISK is never present around the detached component. Some systems that begin as Algol stars (with detached components) may evolve into BETA LYRAE systems, with a high rate of MASS TRANSFER and massive accretion disks. When the mass-transfer rate drops, the accretion disks disappear to reveal the unevolved stars, and the systems display all the characteristics of an Algol-like binary. The eventual fate of an Algol system depends on many factors, most notably on the stars’ masses, which deter- mine their rates of evolution. If the main-sequence star in an Algol system is comparatively massive, it will evolve rapidly and expand to fill its Roche lobe while the com- panion star is still filling its own Roche lobe. The result is a CONTACT BINARY in which both stars share the same photosphere. These binaries are often called W URSAE MAJORIS STARS after the prototype for this subtype. If the main-sequence star in an Algol system evolves slowly, then its companion may become a WHITE DWARF before the primary swells to fill its Roche lobe. When the primary finally does expand to become a RED GIANT , gas flows across the inner Lagrangian point and goes into orbit about the white dwarf, forming an accretion disk. Such systems, called U GEMINORUM STARS or DW ARF NOVAE , exhibit rapid irregular flickering from the turbu- lent hot spot where the mass-transfer stream strikes the accretion disk. However, most of these systems are not eclipsing pairs. It is important to note that eclipsing vari- ables only appear to fluctuate in light because of the angle from which they are observed. Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO) One of Canada’s principal RADIO ASTRONOMY facilities, operated by the National Research Council and situated in Ontario’s Algonquin Provincial Park, well away from local radio interference. Instruments include a 32-element ARRAY of 3-m (10-ft) dishes for solar observations and a 46-m (150-ft) fully steerable radio dish for studies of stars and galaxies. The ARO began work in 1959, and the 46-m dish was built in 1966. ALH 84001 Abbreviation of ALLAN HILLS 84001 Alhena The star \u0001 Geminorum, visual mag. 1.93, distance 105 l.y., spectral type A1 IV.

It is one of the so-called peculiar A stars, of spectral type A0p with prominent lines of chromium. It is, by a few hundredths of a magnitude, the brightest star in the PLOUGH (Big Dipper). Its name may be a corruption of the Arabic for ‘tail’. Alkaid (Benetnasch) The star \u0003 Ursae Majoris, visual mag. 1.85, distance 101 l.y., spectral type B3 V. The name comes from an Arabic word meaning ‘the leader’. Its alternative name, Benetnasch, is derived from an Arabic phrase referring to a group of mourners accompanying a coffin formed by the quadrilateral of stars which is now known as the bowl of the PLOUGH (commonly referred to in the US as the Big Dipper). Allan Hills 84001 (ALH 84001) METEORITE that was found in Antarctica in 1984 and identified as a MARTIAN METEORITE in 1994. It has a mass of c .1.93 kg. A complex igneous rock, it has suffered both thermal and shock processes. In composition, it is an orthopyroxenite r ich in carbonates, which form patches up to c .0.5 mm across. Few hydrated minerals have been identified amongst the alteration products in ALH 84001, so it has been proposed that the carbonates were produced at the surface of Mars in a region of restricted water flow, such as an evaporating pool of brine. Tiny structures ( c .200 nm in size) within the carbonates have been interpreted by some as fossilized Martian bacteria; however the claim is controversial, and it is subject to continued investigation. Allegheny Observatory Observatory of the University of Pittsburgh, located 6 km (4 mi) north of Pittsburgh. The observatory, which dates from 1859, became part of the university in 1867. During the 1890s its director was J ames E. KEELER , who used a 13-inch (330-mm) refractor to discover the particulate nature of Saturn’s r ings. Later, Allegheny was equipped with the 30-inch (76-cm) Thaw telescope (the third-largest refractor in the USA) and the 31-inch (0.79-m) Keeler reflector. The observatory now specializes in astrometric searches for EXTRASOLAR PLANETS . Allende METEORITE that fell as a shower of stones in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, on 1969 February 8. More than 2 tonnes of material is believed to have fallen. Allende is classified as a CV3 CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITE . Studies of components, such as CAIs and CHONDRULES , within Allende have been instrumental in understanding the structure, chemistry and chronology of the pre-solar nebula. The first INTERSTELLAR GRAINS (nanometre-sized diamonds) to be identified in meteorites were isolated from Allende. Allen Telescope Array (ATA) Large-area radio telescope – formerly called the One-hectare Telescope (1hT) – that will consist of 350 steerable parabolic antennae 6.1 m (20 ft) in diameter. The ATA is a joint undertaking of the SETI Institute and the University of California at Berkeley. When completed in 2005, it will permit the continuous scanning of up to 1 million nearby stars for SETI purposes, and will serve as a prototype for the planned SQUARE KILOMETRE ARRAY .

For astronomical and navigational purposes the leading publication is The ASTRONOMICAL ALMANAC . Alnair The star \u0001 Gruis, visual mag. 1.73, distance 101 l.y., spectral type B7 V. Its name means ‘bright one’, from an Arabic expression meaning ‘bright one from the fish’s tail’, given by an unknown Arab astronomer who visualized the tail of the southern fish, Piscis Austrinus, as extending into this area. Alnath The star \u0002 T auri, visual mag. 1.65, distance 131 l.y., spectral type B7 III. The name, which is also spelled Elnath , comes from the Arabic meaning ‘the bu tting one’ – it marks the tip of one of the horns of T aurus, the bull. Alnilam The star \u0003 Orionis, visual mag. 1.69, distance about 1300 l.y. A blue-white supergiant, spectral type B0 Ia, it is the central star of the three that make up the belt of Orion and is marginally the brightest of them. Its name comes from an Arabic phrase meaning ‘string of pearls’, referring to the belt. Alnitak The star \u0004 Orionis, visual mag. 1.74, distance 820 l.y. It is a binary, with individual components of mags. 1.9 and 4.0, spectral types O9.5 Ib and B0 III, and an orbital period of around 1500 years. A telescope of 75-mm (3-in.) aperture or more should show both stars. Alnitak is a member of the belt of Orion, and its name comes from the Arabic meaning ‘belt’. Alpes (Montes Alps) Cross-faulted lunar mountains that r ise 1–3 km (3600–9800 ft) above the north-east margins of Mare IMBRIUM . The Alps are 290 km (180 mi) long, and are traversed by the ALPES VALLIS . The majority of the bright peaks have altitudes between 2000 and 2500 m (6000–8000 ft), but some are significantly higher: Mount Blanc, one of the Moon’s greatest mountains, is nearly 3500 m (11,500 ft) tall. Alpes Vallis (Alpine Valley) Darkened gap 200 km (120 mi) long that cuts through the lunar mountain range known as the Montes ALPES . The Alpine Valley is a GRABEN that developed as a result of Mare IMBRIUM ’ S tectonic adjustment. Varying in width from 7 to 18 km (4–11 mi), it irregularly tapers away from Mare Imbrium. Two delicate faults cut at right angles across the valley’s floor, which has otherwise been smoothed by the lavas that have filled it. Running down the middle of the valley is a SINUOUS RILLE , which seems to originate in a vent crater, which may be a volcanic feature, probably a collapsed lava tube. Alpha Unofficial name for the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION Alpha 2 Canum Venaticorum star (ACV) Type of main-sequence V ARIABLE STAR that exhibits photometric, magnetic and spectral fluctuations, primarily as a result of stellar rotation. Periods range from 0.5 to 150 days; amplitudes from 0.01 to 0.1 mag.; and spectra from B8p to A7p. The subtype ACV0 exhibits additional low- amplitude ( c .0.1 mag.) non-radial pulsations, with periods of 0.003 to 0.1 days. See also SPECTRUM VARIABLE Alpha Capricornids Minor METEOR SHOWER , active from mid-July until mid-August and best seen from lower latitudes. Peak activity occurs around August 2, from a RADIANT a few degrees north-east of \u0001 Capricorni. Rates are low, about six meteors/hr at most, b ut the shower produces a high proportion of bright, flaring meteors with long paths. The meteor stream may be associated with the short-period (5.27 years) comet 45P/Honda–Mrkos–Pajdusaková; it has a low-inclination orbit close to the ecliptic. Spreading of stream METEOROIDS by planetary perturbations means that the radiant is rather diffuse. Alpha Centauri (Rigil Kentaurus, Toliman) Closest naked-eye star to the Sun, 4.4 l.y. away, with a visual mag. of \u0005 0.28, making it the third-brightest star in the sky. Small telescopes reveal that it is a triple system. The two brightest components are of solar type, mags. \u0005 0.01 and 1.35, spectral types G2 V and K1 V, forming a binary with an orbital period of 79.9 years. The third member of the system is the red dwarf PROXIMA CENTAURI , which is the closest star of all to the Sun. Alpha Centauri is also known as Rigil Kentaurus (Rigil Kent for short), from the Arabic meaning ‘centaur’s foot’. An alternative name, To l i man , is derived from an Arabic term meaning ‘ostriches’, the figure visualized by Arab astronomers in the stars of this region. Alpha Monocerotids Normally very minor METEOR SHOWER , active around November 21–22. The shower produced outbursts of more substantial activity in 1925, 1935, 1985 and 1995, suggesting a ten-year periodicity with several stronger displays having been missed. In 1995 rates of one or two meteors per minute were sustained for only a short interval. The shower is apparently associated with comet C/1943 W1 van Gent- P eltier-Daimaca. alpha particle Helium nucleus, consisting of two protons and two neutrons, positively charged. Helium is the second-most abundant element (after Hydrogen), so alpha particles are found in most regions of PLASMA , such as inside stars, in diffuse gas around hot stars and in cosmic rays. Alpha particles are also produced by the radioactive decay of some elements. In the PROTON – PROTON chain of nuclear fusion reactions inside stars, four protons (hydrogen nuclei) are converted to one alpha particle (helium nucleus) with release of fusion energy, which powers stars.

Its name comes from an Arabic word meaning ‘the solitary one’, a reference to its position in an area of sky in which there are no other bright stars. Alpha Regio Isolated highland massif on VENUS (25º.5S 0º.3E), showing complex structure; it is best described as a plateau encircled by groups of high v olcanic domes.

It is an ALGOL STAR ; its brightness drops by 0.1 mag. every 17.4 days as one star eclipses the other. Its name, which is also spelled Alphecca , comes from the name al-fakka , meaning ‘coins’, by which Arab astronomers knew the constellation Corona Borealis. More recently, the star has also become known as Gemma , since it shines like a jewel in the northern crown. Alpheratz The star \u0001 Andromedae, visual mag. 2.07, distance 97 l.y. It has a peculiar SPECTRUM , classified as B9p, which has prominent lines of mercury and magnesium. Its name is derived from the Arabic al- faras , meaning ‘the horse’, since it used to be regarded as being shared with neighbouring Pegasus (and was also designated \u0002 P egasi); indeed, it still marks one corner of the SQUARE OF PEGASUS . Its alternative name, Sirrah , is derived from the Arabic surrat al-faras , meaning ‘horse’s navel’. Alphonso X (1221–84) King of Léon and Castile (part of modern Spain), known as Alphonso the Wise, a patron of learning and especially of astronomy. He commissioned a new edition of the highly successful T oledan Tables of the motions of the Sun, Moon and five naked-eye planets, prepared originally by AL - ZARQA ̄ LI ̄ in Toledo a century before. The new Alphonsine Tables , incorporating ten years of revised observations and completed in 1272, were not superseded for almost 400 years. Alphonsus Lunar crater (13º.5S 3ºW), 117 km (72 mi) across. Its fault-dissected walls rise to over 3000 m (10,000 ft) above the floor. Running nearly north–south across the floor is a ridge system, which is 15 km (9 mi) wide and, at the point where it forms a prominent central peak, about 1000 m (3000 ft) high. Within Alphonsus are a series of kilometre-sized elliptical features with haloes of dark material; they are oriented roughly parallel to the central ridge system and are considered by many planetary geologists to be of v olcanic origin. In 1958 Soviet astrophysicist Nikolai Kozyrev (1908–83) obtained a spectrum showing blue emission lines, which he interpreted as proof of a gaseous emission from the crater’s central peak, but these results have never been duplicated. The north wall of Alphonsus overlaps the south wall of PTOLEMAEUS , indicating that Alphonsus formed following the Ptolemaeus impact event.

The scarp is roughly concentric with the south-west margins of Mare NECTARIS . It may be the sole remnant of an outer ring of a much larger, multi-ring impact BASIN . altazimuth mounting T elescope mounting that has one axis (altitude) perpendicular to the horizon, and the other (azimuth) parallel to the horizon. An altazimuth (short for ‘altitude–azimuth’) mounting is much lighter, cheaper and easier to construct than an EQUATORIAL MOUNTING for the same size telescope, but is generally not capable of tracking the apparent motion of celestial objects caused by the Earth’s rotation. Many amateur instruments with altazimuth mountings can therefore be used for general viewing, but are not suitable for long- exposure photography. Historically, large professional telescopes were invari- ably built with massive equatorial mountings, which often dwarfed the instrument they held. The lightweight and simple nature of altazimuth mountings, combined with high-speed computers, has led to almost all modern instruments being built with altazimuth mountings. On these telescopes, computers are used to control the com- plex three-axis motions needed for an altazimuth mount to track the stars. Both the altitude and azimuth axes are driven at continuously varying rates but, in addition, the field of view will rotate during a long photographic expo- sure, requiring an additional drive on the optical axis to 11 A \u0001 altazimuth mounting This simple form of telescope mount allows free movement in both horizontal and vertical axes, but is not suitable for use with motordrives, unless they are computer controlled. horizontal axis vertical axis eyepiece A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:04 pm Page 11"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"counter FIELD ROTATION .

The altitude of a particular object depends both on the location of the observer and the time the observation is made. It is measured vertically from 0º at the horizon, along the great circle passing through the object, to a maximum of 90º at the ZENITH . Any object below the observer’s horizon is deemed to have a negative altitude.

The optical component to be aluminized is first thoroughly cleaned and placed in a vacuum chamber, together with pure aluminium wire, which is attached to tungsten heating elements. After removing the air from the chamber, the heating elements are switched on, vaporizing the aluminium, which then condenses on to the clean surface of the optical component. This forms an evenly distributed coating, usually just a few micrometres thick. Alvan Clark & Sons American firm of opticians and telescope-makers whose 19th-century refracting TELESCOPES include the largest in the world. After a career as a portrait painter and engraver, Alvan Clark (1804–87) started an optical workshop in 1846 under the family name with his sons, George Bassett Clark (1827–91) and Alvan Graham Clark (1832–97), the latter joining the firm in the 1850s. Alvan Graham Clark discovered over a dozen new double stars, including, in 1862, the 8th-magnitude Sirius B. During the second half of the 19th century, Alvan Clark & Sons crafted the fine objective lenses for the largest refracting telescopes in the world, including the UNITED STATES NAVAL OBSERVATORY ’s 26-inch (0.66-m) (1873), PULKOVO OBSERVATORY ’s 30-inch (0.76-m) (1878), Leander McCormick (Charlottesville, Virginia) Observatory’s 28-inch (0.7-m) (1883), LICK OBSERVATO - RY ’s 36-inch (0.9-m) (1888), LOWELL OBSERVATORY ’s 24-inch (0.6-m) (1896) and YERKES OBSERVATORY ’s 40-inch (1-m) (1897). In addition to these large profes- sional instruments, the firm made numerous smaller refractors, 4–6 inch (100–150 mm) in aperture, which are prized by today’s collectors of antique telescopes. Alvarez, Luis Walter (1911–88) American physicist who first identified the layer of clay enriched by the element iridium that appears in the strata separating the Cretaceous and Tertiary geological periods, known as the K/T boundary. Since meteorites contain much higher amounts of iridium than do terrestrial rocks and soil, Alvarez’ discovery supported the hypothesis that a giant meteorite impact ( see CHICXULUB ) may have caused a mass extinction event on our planet 65 million years ago. al-Zarqa ̄ li, Abu ̄I shaq Ibrahim ibn Yahya (Latinized as Arzachel , and other variants) (1028–87) Arab astronomer who worked in Toledo, Spain, and prepared the famous T oledan Tables of planetary positions, which corrected and updated the work of Ptolemy and Muhammad ibn Mu ̄sa ̄ al-Khwa ̄rizmı ̄( c .780–c.850).

Amalthea Largest of JUPITER ’ S inner satellites. Amalthea w as the fifth Jovian moon to be found, in 1892 by E.E. BARNARD , and the first since the four much larger GALILEAN SATELLITES we re discovered in 1610. The discovery was made visually, the last such discovery for a planetary satellite. Amalthea is irregular in shape, measuring about 270 \u0002 165 \u0002 150 km (168 \u0002 103 \u0002 93 mi). Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a distance of only 181,400 km (112,700 mi), under SYNCHRONOUS RO TA TION with a period of 0.498 days such that it always keeps the same blunt end towards the planet. Its orbit is near-circular, inclined to the Jovian equator by only 0º.4. Amalthea is notable as being the reddest object in the Solar System, possibly because of the accumulation of a surface covering of sulphur derived from the EJECTA of IO ’s v olcanoes. Amalthea has considerable surface relief, with two large craters, called Pan and Gaea, and two mountains, named Mons Ida and Mons Lyctos. Some sloping regions appear very bright and green, the cause of this phenomenon being unknown. amateur astronomy, history of From at least as early as the 17th century until around 1890, astronomical research in Britain was invariably undertaken by those who worked for love and considered themselves ‘amateurs’ (from Latin amat , ‘he loves’). The reasons w ere political and economic, as successive governments operated low-taxation, low-state-spending policies that encouraged private rather than public initiatives. Amateur astronomy, while it existed on Continental Europe, was less innovative, largely because the governments of France, Germany and Russia taxed more heavily and invested in professional science as an expression of state power. The United States had a mixed astronomical research tradition, with outstanding amateurs, such as the spectroscopist Henry DRAPER , engaged in front-rank research, and major professional observatories financed by millionaire benefactors. Although the British astronomical tradition was predominantly amateur, its leading figures were ‘Grand Amateurs’ in so far as fundamental research was their dominant concern. In the Victorian age, wealthy gentleman scientists were willing to spend huge sums of money to pursue new lines of research and commission g round-breaking technologies, such as big reflecting telescopes. The quality of Grand Amateur research enjoyed peer recognition from European and American altitude 12 A \u0001 altitude The altitude of a celestial object relative to an observer is measured on a scale of 0–90° from the observer’s horizon to the zenith – the point directly overhead. celestial object zenith altitude observer azimuth plane of horizon N Oº W S E A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:04 pm Page 12"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Ambartsumian, Viktor Amazaspovich professionals, while its own esprit de corps was expressed through membership of the ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY and the Royal Society in London, academic honours and a clearly defined social network. This was, indeed, professional-quality research paid for by private individuals. Grand Amateurs pioneered work on the gravitation of double star systems, cosmology, planetary studies, selenography, photography and spectroscopy, and included between 1820 and 1900 such figures as John HERSCHEL , William DA WES , Lord R OSSE , Admiral William SMYTH , William LASSELL , William HUGGINS , Norman LOCKYER and the master- b uilder and astrophotographer Isaac Roberts (1829–1904). The results of their researches transformed our understanding of the Universe. Y et Victorian Britain also saw a fascination with astronomy spreading to the less well-off middle and even w orking classes. School teachers, modest lawyers, clergymen and even artisans took up astronomy; the self- educated telescope-maker John Jones worked for a few shillings per week as a labourer on Bangor docks, Wales. P eople with modest and often home-made instruments (especially after the silvered glass mirror replaced speculum in the 1860s) did not expect, like the Grand Amateurs, to change the course of astronomy, but enjoyed practical observation as a serious and instructive hobby. The Reverend Thomas WEBB ’s celebrated Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes (1859) became the ‘bible’ for these serious amateurs. The big-city astronomical societies of Leeds (1859, 1892), Liverpool (1881), Cardiff (1894), Belfast ( c .1895) and others became the foci for these observing amateurs, with their lectures, meetings and journals. In 1890 the BRITISH ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION (BAA) became the national organizing body for British amateurs, with branches in Manchester (1892, 1903) and elsewhere, many of which later became independent societies. Unlike the Royal Astronomical Society, they all admitted women as members. These societies, which dominated amateur astronomy well into the 20th century, remained predominantly middle-class, and it was not until the major social and economic changes in Britain following 1945 that the demographic base of British amateur astronomical societies began to widen significantly. The BAA established a system whereby amateurs would send their observations to a central clearing house where they would be synthesized by an expert and the collective results published. The great majority of amateurs who contribute observations on behalf of science continue to operate within such systems ( see also THE ASTRONOMER ). Amateur astronomy changed dramatically after World W ar II, and much of the emphasis moved across the Atlantic. Before the war, in the 1920s, the ranks of active amateur observers were swelled with the founding of the amateur telescope-making (ATM) movement by Russell PORTER and Albert G. Ingalls (1888–1958). Now that inexpensive war-surplus optical equipment was widely av ailable, it was no longer essential for an amateur astronomer to build a telescope from the ground up as a r ite of passage. By the mid-1950s, a wide variety of commercial instruments had entered the marketplace; later designs, such as the SCHMIDT – CASSEGRAIN and DOBSONIAN TELESCOPES , owed much to amateur observers and remain extremely popular. The numbers of amateur observers grew rapidly, particularly in the United States. It is no coincidence that the ASTRONOMICAL LEAGUE (1946) and the ASSOCIATION OF LUNAR AND PLANETARY OBSERVERS (1947) were formed at this time. A watershed for professional–amateur collaboration came in 1956 with the establishment of the Moonwatch programme, in anticipation of satellite launches for the International Geophysical Year (1957–59). Energized by the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik 1, and guided by astronomers at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Moonwatch galvanized amateurs around the world in a unique and grand pro–am effort. The appearance of affordable charge-coupled devices (CCDs) in the final decade of the 20th century had an even greater impact on amateurs than had the war- surplus items of two generations before. Digital data, exponentially increasing computing power, and ever more sophisticated commercial SOFTWARE together created a revolution. They allowed amateurs to become competitive with ground-based professionals in the quality of data obtained in such areas as astrometry, photometry and the imaging of Solar System objects. New organizations with new ideas sprang up. The INTERNATIONAL AMATEUR – PROFESSIONAL PHOTOELECTRIC PHOTOMETRY g roup, founded in 1980, is the prototype organization representing this new era. It encourages joint amateur–professional authorship of technical papers. Similar, though focused on campaigns to study cataclysmic variable stars, is the Center for Backyard Astrophysics. One of the latest groups to form is The Amateur Sky Survey, a bold venture to develop the hardware and software needed to patrol automatically the sky in search of objects that change in brightness or move. Other groups, such as the INTERNATIONAL OCCULTATION TIMING ASSOCIATION , have graduated from visual observations of lunar events to video recordings that determine the profiles of asteroids. The INTERNATIONAL DARK - SKY ASSOCIATION campaigns on an issue of concern to professionals and amateurs alike. As the present era of mammoth all-sky surveys from Earth and space culminates, the need for follow-up observations – particularly continuous monitoring of selected objects – will grow dramatically. In a traditional sense, because of their numbers and worldwide distribution, sophisticated amateurs are ideally suited for such tasks, not as minions but as true partners with professionals. And, in the era of the Internet, amateurs should be able to plumb online sky-survey D AT ABASES just as readily as professionals can. The challenge facing the entire astronomical community today is to educate both camps about rewarding possibilities through mutual cooperation.

AM Herculis star (AM) Binary system, with period in the range 1 to 3 hours, that shows strongly variable linear and circular polarization and also eclipses. AM Herculis stars are strongly variable X-ray sources and their light- curves change from orbit to orbit. They also show changes in brightness and in variability with time scales of decades. The total range of light variations may reach 4–5 magnitude V. AM Herculis stars seem to be related to DW ARF NOVAE , in that one component is a K-M-type dwarf and the other a compact object, but they differ in that the magnetic field of the compact component is sufficiently strong to dominate the mass flow and thus cause the effects observed. Am Herculis stars are also known as Polars.

Like the other MARS - CROSSING ASTEROIDS , Amor asteroids have limited lifetimes because of the chance of a collision with that planet. Over extended periods of time many Amors will evolve to become APOLLO ASTEROIDS , reducing their lifetimes further because of the greater chance of an impact on the Earth, or one of the other terrestrial planets. The disparity of compositional types observed indicates that Amors derive from various sources, including extinct cometary nuclei, the KIRKWOOD GAPS (through jovian perturbations) and the inner MAIN BELT (through perturbations imposed by Mars). The first Amor-type asteroid to be discovered was EROS , in 1898, but the archetype giving them their collective name is (1221) Amor. That object was found in 1932, the same year as the first Apollo asteroid. Over 760 Amors had been discovered by late 2001.

In his cosmogony, the Universe came into existence from an ‘eternal reservoir’, rotation having spread fire (the stars) to outer regions, leaving heavy matter (Earth) at the centre.

Ancient Beijing Observatory Astronomical observatory founded in 1442, situated in central Beijing on an elevated platform 14 m (46 ft) above street level.

Andromeda See feature article Andromeda Galaxy (M31, NGC 224) One of the two g iant spiral galaxies in the LOCAL GROUP of galaxies, the other being our Galaxy, the Milky Way. M31 is the nearest spiral to the Milky Way, some 2.4 million l.y. aw ay . Its proximity has led to intensive studies by astronomers, yielding fundamental advances in such diverse fields as star formation, stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis, dark matter, and the distance scale and evolution of the Universe. The Andromeda spiral is visible to the naked eye. F ound close to the 4th-magnitude star \u0001 Andromedae, M31 (RA 00 h 42 m .7 dec. \u0002 41º16 \u0003 ) appears as a faint patch of light, best seen on a transparent, moonless night from a dark site. It was recorded by the 10th-century Per- sian astronomer AL SU ̄ FI ̄ as a ‘little cloud’. Binoculars and small telescopes show the central regions as an elongated haze; long-exposure imaging with large instruments is required to show the galaxy’s spiral structure. The Andromeda Galaxy played an important role in the ‘ GREAT DEBATE ’ among astronomers in the 1920s regarding the nature of the spiral nebulae: were these ‘island universes’ – complete star systems outside our own – as proposed by the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel KANT , or were they gas clouds within the Milky Way col- lapsing to form stars? Photographs taken in 1888 by Isaac Roberts (1829–1904) using a 20-inch (0.5-m) telescope revealed M31’s spiral nature, but it was not until the 1920s that the most important clues were uncovered by Edwin HUBBLE . In 1923–24, using the 100-inch (2.5-m) Hooker T elescope at Mount Wilson, California, Hubble was able to image individual CEPHEID VARIABLES in the Andromeda spiral. Applying the PERIOD – LUMINOSITY RULE to the derived light-curves showed that the spiral was a galaxy in its own right beyond our own. The next important stage in the study of M31 came between 1940 and 1955, with the painstaking observa- tions of Walter BAADE from Mount Wilson during the wa r time blackout, and later with the 200-inch (5-m) Hale 15 A ANDROMEDA C onstellation of the northern sky between the Square of Pegasus and the ‘W’ of Cassiopeia.

Baade succeeded in resolving stars in the Andromeda Galaxy’s central bulge; they appeared to be mainly old and red, substantially fainter than the bright blue stars of the outer regions, and apparently similar to those in globular clus- ters. Baade referred to the bulge stars as Population II, labelling the hot disk stars as Population I ( see POPULA - TIONS , STELLAR ). This distinction remains in current use and is an essential feature of accepted theories of star for- mation, and stellar and galaxy evolution. The discovery of the two stellar populations led in turn to a crucial finding for cosmology. The Cepheid variables turned out to be of two subsets, one belonging to each pop- ulation, obeying different period-luminosity rules. Since the Cepheids observed by Hubble were of Population I, the derived distance of M31 had to be revised upwards by a factor of two – as, were all other distances to galaxies, which had used the Andromeda Galaxy as a ‘stepping stone’. The neutral hydrogen (HI) distribution in M31 has been extensively studied by radio astronomers, observing the TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE EMISSION LINE . Neutral h ydrogen is a constituent of the galaxy’s gas and is distrib- uted like other Population I components. The gas shows a ZONE - OF - AV OIDANCE near the galactic centre, which is where Population II stars dominate. The gas is distributed in a torus, the innermost parts of which seem to be falling towards the nucleus. Radial velocities of hot gas clouds across the galaxy have been mapped. Together with HI observations, these measurements allow a rotation curve to be constructed as a function of galactic radius. HI measurements, particu- larly, suggest that the outer regions of M31 contain sub- stantial amounts of unseen additional mass. Such halos of D ARK MATTER are crucial to current theories of galaxy for- mation and clustering, and cosmology. Observations with the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE in 1993 showed the nucleus of M31 to be double, with its components separated by about 5 l.y. This may be the result of a comparatively recent merger between the Andromeda Galaxy and a dwarf companion. Several small satellite galaxies surround M31, the most promi- nent being M32 (NGC 221) and M110 (NGC 205). The disk of M31 shows a number of star clouds, the most obvious being NGC 206, which covers an area of 2900 \u0001 1400 l.y. About 30 novae can be detected in M31 each year by large telescopes. M31 was the site, in 1885 August, of the first SUPERNOVA to be observed beyond the Milky Way: it was designated S Andromedae and reached a peak apparent magnitude \u0002 6. It might be expected that the proximity of M31 would mean that it could make a substantial contribution to theo- r ies for the development of spiral structure. Instead, it has contributed controversy, partly because the galaxy is so close to edge-on that details of the spiral structure are hard to delineate. Indeed, it is not even known how many spiral arms there are. Halton ARP has proposed two trailing spi- ral arms, one of these disturbed by the gravitational pull of M32. A. Kalnajs proposes instead a single leading spiral arm, set up via gravitational resonance with M32. The dust clouds do not help in deciding between these two models. Resolution of the debate will ultimately advance our understanding of the mechanism generating spiral structure ( see DENSITY WAVE THEORY ). M31 is surrounded by a halo of globular clusters, which is some three times more extensive than the halo around our Galaxy. The stars in these clusters show a generally higher metallicity than is found in our own Galaxy’s globu- lars. The great spread in element abundances in the M31 globular clusters suggests slower and more irregular evolu- tion than has occurred in the Milky Way. Nearly every galaxy in the Universe shows a REDSHIFT , indicative of recession from the Milky Way. The spectrum of M31, however, shows it to be approaching at a velocity of about 35 km/s (22 mi/s). In some 3 billion years, M31 and the Milky Way will collide and merge eventually to form a giant elliptical galaxy. M31 is our sister galaxy, the nearest spiral galaxy that is similar in most attributes to the Milky Way. Much of our home Galaxy is hidden from our perspective by mas- sive dust clouds; we rely on the Andromeda Galaxy for an understanding of our own Galaxy, as well as of the rest of the Universe. Andromedids (Bielids) METEOR SHOWER associated with comet 3D/ BIELA . The parent comet split into two fragments in 1845 and has not been definitely seen since 1852; it is now considered defunct. Swarms of METEOROIDS released from the comet have given rise to spectacular meteor showers. Its name derives from its RADIANT position, near \u0003 Andromedae. The shower’s first recorded appearance was in 1741, when modest activity was observed. Further displays w ere seen in 1798, 1830, 1838 and 1847, in each case during the first week of December. The 1798 and 1838 displays produced rates of over 100 meteors/hr. When seen in 1867 the Andromedids appeared on the last day of November. The NODE , where the orbit of the mete- oroid swarm and the orbit of the Earth intersect, is sub- ject to change as a result of gravitational perturbations by the planets. The Andromedid node is moved earlier (regresses) by two or three weeks per century. In 1867 the association between a meteor shower and a comet was demonstrated by Giovanni SCHIAPARELLI in the case of the PERSEIDS ; other such connections were sought. It was known that the orbit of Biela’s comet approached that of the Earth very closely, so that its debris could conceivably give rise to a meteor shower, and when the radiant was calculated it was found to agree closely with that of the meteor showers previously seen to emanate from Andromeda. Biela’s comet, if it still existed, would have been in the vicinity of the Earth in 1867, and since the meteoroid sw arm would not be far displaced from its progenitor, a display could be expected. A good, though not spectacu- lar, Andromedid shower was seen on November 30, con- firming the prediction. Since the orbital period was about 6.5 years, Edmund Weiss (1837–1917), Heinrich D ’ AR - REST and Johann GALLE , who had made the first calcula- tions, predicted another display for 1872 November 28. Soon after sunset on 1872 November 27, a day earlier than expected, western European observers were treated Andromedids 16 A \u0001 Andromeda Galaxy The Andromeda Galaxy, M31, is the largest member of the Local Group and is the farthest object that can be seen with the naked eye.

The event caused less alarm and terror among the general population than it might have done, there having occurred only six years previously an equally dramatic LEONID display, which had caused no harm. Although the Andromedids were about as numer- ous as the 1866 Leonids, they were less brilliant due to their lower atmospheric velocity, at 19 km/s (12 mi/s) compared with the Leonids’ 70 km/s (43 mi/s). The shower of 1872 led, incidentally, to a mysterious episode in astronomical history. E.F. Wilhelm Klinkerfues (1827–84), at Göttingen Observatory, reasoning that it should presumably be ahead of the meteoroid swarm, suggested that the comet should be visible in the opposite part of the sky direction to the Andromedid radiant. He accordingly cabled to Norman POGSON , an astronomer at Madras (the comet would not be visible from high north- ern latitudes): ‘Biela touched Earth 27 November – search near Theta Centauri.’ On December 2, Pogson’s search found a comet near the indicated position. The object was observed again the following night, but then clouds intervened and when a clearance finally came, there was no sign of it. The observations were inadequate for the calculation of an orbit and the prediction of future positions, so the comet, if such it was, was lost. If Biela’s comet still existed and was pursuing its original orbit, it w ould have passed the position indicated by Klinkerfues some months previously. We must conclude that if Pog- son, who was an experienced observer, did see a comet, it w as not 3D/Biela, and was either a fragment of that object or another comet that just happened to be there at the time. Both alternatives are hard to believe, and the ques- tion remains open. The next encounter was badly timed, and no shower w as seen. In 1885, two revolutions after the 1872 event, European observers were delighted and thrilled by an even greater meteor storm on November 27, during which Andromedid rates were estimated (counting was virtually impossible) at 75,000 per hour. This rate com- pares with that of 140,000 per hour estimated for the 1966 Leonid peak. The most intense activity in the 1885 Andromedids was over in about six hours (such meteor storms are invariably short-lived), though lower rates were detected for a few days to either side. This suggests that the core filament in the Andromedid meteor stream in 1885 had a width of about 160,000 km (100,000 mi). The fall of an iron METEORITE at Mazapil, Mexico, during the 1885 Andromedid display can be dismissed as coincidence. Meteoroids shed by comets are generally small, have a dusty composition, and never survive ABLA - TION in Earth’s atmosphere. Since 1885 the Andromedids have been quite undistin- guished, and the shower is now to all intents and purposes defunct. Planetary perturbations have shifted the orbit of the meteoroid swarm so that it does not at present meet that of the Earth. A fairly strong display occurred on 1892 November 23, while on 1899 November 24 about 200 Andromedids per hour were seen. W.F. DENNING record- ed 20 Andromedids per hour in 1904, and visual observa- tions in 1940 yielded rates of about 30 per hour on November 15. A few individual shower members were caught by the Harvard Super-Schmidt meteor cameras in the USA in 1952 and 1953. A computer model of the Andromedid stream by David Hughes (1941– ), of the University of Sheffield, UK, suggests that further plane- tary gravitational perturbations will bring the shower back to encounter the Earth around 2120. Angara New fleet of Russian satellite launch vehicles to be operational in about 2003 to replace the PROTON launch v ehicle. The Angara will be based on a first stage, which forms the basic vehicle for flights to low Earth orbit. This stage can be clustered together with two types of upper stage, forming a more powerful first stage, for flights to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO). The largest Angara, with five core first stages and a high-energy KVRD upper stage, will be able to place 6.8 tonnes into GTO.

Ångström, Anders Jonas (1814–74) Swedish physicist who helped prepare the ground for the application of spectroscopy in astronomy. He used diffraction gratings to make high-precision measurements of the Sun’s spectral lines, and in 1868 he published an a tlas of the solar spectrum. It contained measurements of ov er a thousand lines, expressed in units of 10 –7 mm, a quantity later named the ANGSTROM UNIT in his honour. angstrom unit (symbol Å) Unit of length, formerly used to express the wavelength of light, particularly in spectroscopy; it is equal to 10 \u0001 10 m. It is named after Anders Jonas ÅNGSTRÖM , who first used it in his atlas of the solar spectrum in 1868. The angstrom has now been replaced by the SI measurement the NANOMETRE (nm). angular measure Measure of the apparent diameter of a celestial object, or the distance between two objects, expressed as an angle, usually in degrees, arcminutes or arcseconds. The angle subtended by an object is determined by its true diameter and its distance from the observer; if the distance to an object is known, its true diameter may be calculated by measuring its apparent diameter. angular momentum Property of rotating or orbiting bodies that is the rotational equivalent of the momentum of an object moving in a straight line. It is the product of the angular velocity and the moment of inertia ( I ). The moment of inertia is the rotational equivalent of mass, and for a small particle it is given by the mass of that particle multiplied by the square of its distance from the rotational axis. For large objects the overall moment of inertia must be found by adding together the individual moments of inertia of its constituent particles. A planet orbiting the Sun may be regarded as a small particle and so has a moment of inertia of I = M p R o 2 , where M p is the mass of the planet and R o the distance of the planet from the Sun. A spherical, uniform, rotating planet will have I = 0.4 M p R p 2 where R p is the radius of the planet. Angular momentum is always conserved (that is, its total value for the system remains constant) during any changes. angular momentum 17 A A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:04 pm Page 17"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"The rotational kinetic energy is given by I \u0001 2 /2, where \u0001 is the angular velocity (compare this with the kinetic energy of an object moving in a straight line: Mv 2 /2). For a planet in an elliptical orbit, R o is smaller at PERI - HELION than at APHELION ; conservation of angular momentum therefore means that the orbital angular velocity, \u0001 o , must decrease from perihelion to aphelion in order that the product, R o \u0001 o , remains constant. Kepler’s second law of planetary motion is thus the result of con- servation of angular momentum. Similarly conservation of angular momentum results in ACCRETION DISKS form- ing in CLOSE BINARY stars where mass is being exchanged, and so is linked to many types of VARIABLE STAR including NOVAE and Type I SUPERNOVAE . Ann Arbor Observatory (University of Michigan Detroit Observatory) Historic institution in Ann Arbor, 58 km (36 mi) west of Detroit. It was founded ( c .1854) as part of the university’s bid for pre-eminence in scientific teaching and research. It is equipped with a 12 \u0001 \u0002 - inch (320-mm) refractor dating from 1857. Today, the observatory is used largely for public outreach, having been restored in 1999 as a centre for 19th-century science, technology and culture. annual parallax (heliocentric parallax) Difference in the apparent position of a star that would be measured by hypothetical observations made from the centre of the Earth and the centre of the Sun. Due to the Earth’s movement in its orbit around the Sun, nearby stars appear to shift their position relative to more distant, background stars, over the course of a year, describing a path known as the parallactic ellipse. When observed six months apart from opposite sides of the Earth’s orbit, the position of a nearby star will appear to have shifted by an angle \u0002\u0003 . Half of this angle, \u0004 , gives the annual PARALLAX , which is equal to the angle subtended at the observed star by the semimajor axis of the Earth’s orbit. The reciprocal of annual parallax in arcseconds gives the distance to the star in PARSECS . See also DIURNAL PARALLAX ; TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX annular eclipse Special instance of a SOLAR ECLIPSE , occurring when the Moon is close to APOGEE , such that the Sun has a significantly greater apparent diameter than the Moon. As a result, the Moon’s central passage across the solar disk leaves a ring – or annulus – of bright sunlight visible at mid-eclipse. Such events, while interesting in their own right, are not generally considered as dramatic as a total solar eclipse, since they do not allow the solar corona and prominences to become visible, or cause a noticeable darkening even at their maximum extent. Under favourable circumstances, the annular phase, with the dark body of the Moon silhouetted against the Sun’s brilliant photosphere, can last up to 12 m 30 s . anomalistic month Time taken for the Moon to complete a single orbit around the Earth, measured from PERIGEE to perigee.

See also DRACONIC MONTH ; MONTH ; SIDEREAL MONTH ; TROPICAL MONTH anomalistic year Period of a single orbit of the Earth around the Sun, measured from PERIHELION to perihelion. Equivalent to 365.25964 days of MEAN SOLAR TIME , an anomalistic year is about 4 m 43 s .5 longer than a SIDEREAL YEAR because of the gradual eastward movement of the point of perihelion. See also TROPICAL YEAR anomaly Angular measurement used for describing the position of a body in an elliptical orbit, measured around the orbit in the direction of motion from the pericentre. It can be defined as a true, eccentric or mean anomaly. In the diagram the point X represents the position of the body, and the angle PSX is the true anomaly. The mean anomaly is measured similarly, but to the position of an imaginary body that orbits at constant angular speed with the same period as the real body. It cannot be indicated by a simple geometrical construction. The eccentric anomaly is the angle PCX \u0005 , where X \u0005 is the position of the body projected on to a circumscribing circle. The eccentric and mean anomalies are intermediate angles used in the calculation of the position of the object in its orbit at any time. The difference between the true and mean anomaly is the equation of the centre. See also ELLIPSE anorthosite Type of basaltic rock found in the lunar highland crust.

It is diametrically opposite on the celestial sphere to the APEX , the direction towards which the Sun and Solar System appear to be moving. Antarctic astronomy Collective term for the astronomical activities conducted in the special conditions of the Earth’s south polar continent. The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station sits atop a 2800-m (9200-ft) cap of ice – the coldest, driest place on Earth. This venue is ideal for astronomers who want to work at infrared, submillimetre and millimetre wavelengths. These portions of the electromagnetic spectrum are compromised by water vapour, which is pervasive at most other locations on Earth and makes observations at these long wavelengths difficult or impossible. But at the pole, the vapour is frozen out, leading to a dark, transparent sky ideal for investigating star-formation processes in molecular clouds and the evolution of protostars and other young objects. Similarly, distant, primeval galaxies can be effectively studied because their visible light has been redshifted to long wavelengths. The pole is also a premier site for assaying variations in the so-called COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND (CMB), subtle differences that reflect the large-scale distribution of matter and energy in the very early Universe. In addition, of course, a polar site features a totally dark sky 24 hours a day during midwinter, which allows con- tinual monitoring of targets. And during midsummer the Sun can also be watched continuously, which was crucial in the 1980s, during the early days of HELIOSEISMOLOGY , when we got the first glimpse of the interior of our star. Antarctic astronomy was born around 1980, spurred Ann Arbor Observatory 18 A \u0001 annular eclipse The bright photosphere of the Sun can be seen surrounding the Moon during an annular eclipse.

The principal organization is the Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica. Among other facilities, it supports research with the Antarctic Submil- limeter Telescope/Remote Observatory (AST/RO), a 1.7-m (67-in.) instrument that focuses on atomic and molecular gas in our Galaxy and others nearby, and the 13-element Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI) for studies of the CMB. One ‘telescope’ at the south pole looks down rather than up – the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA). Its mission is to count ultra-high-energy neutrinos from our Galaxy and beyond that have passed through the Earth, which screens out ‘noise’. AMANDA detects the light that is emitted when a neutrino interacts with an atom in the Antarctic icecap. Sources of extremely high-energy neutrinos include active galactic nuclei, black holes, supernovae remnants and neutron stars. There is much more to Antarctic astronomy than what happens at the pole. This continent provides one of our best ‘laboratories’ to prepare for the search for exotic life forms elsewhere in the Solar System. On the polar plateau in East Antarctica lies Lake Vostok. The size of Lake Ontario in North America, it has been buried under thousands of metres of ice for millions of years. Although unexplored, Lake Vostok might hold extremophiles that could help us determine how organ- isms might survive in the putative ocean under the ice mantle of Jupiter’s satellite Europa. Off the plateau and within a helicopter flight of McMur- do Station, the ‘capital’ of Antarctica, are the Dry Valleys, frozen landscapes that, though more benign, nevertheless mimic those of Mars. Yet life goes on in these valleys, some- times hidden inside rocks that protect cyanobacteria from desiccation, thermal extremes and overexposure to ultravio- let radiation. Perhaps this strategy also operates, or once did, on Mars and elsewhere in the Solar System. Antarctica is also conducive for launching experiments aboard long-duration balloons that ascend 40 km (25 mi) into the upper stratosphere. The prevailing westerly winds carry such balloons around the continent and return them to near the launch site at McMurdo Station in about 10 days. Gamma-rays, X-rays and CMB radiation have all been sampled during such balloon flights. One of the most surprising discoveries in Antarctica took place in 1969, when nine meteorites were found near the Yamato Mountains. Since then concerted searches have uncovered some 20,000 rocks from space – more than half of all known meteoritic specimens. Antarctica is not favoured by falling meteorites. The abundance occurs because when meteorites land they become embedded in flowing ice – as if on a conveyor belt – and carried to sites where they become exposed by wind erosion. A few have been identified as pieces of the Moon and Mars. An Antarctic meteorite known as ALH 84001 became famous in 1996 when scientists announced that it contains fossil evidence for life on Mars.

RADAR ASTRONOMY uses antennae (or aerials) to make either continuous wave or pulsed transmissions to bodies in the Solar System, either from Earth or from space satellites. Amateur astronomers can study meteors by using low- power transmitters in the 10–20 MHz band and observing the reflections off the ionized trails made by the meteors in the upper atmosphere. Other work requires powerful transmitters and high-gain antenna systems. T ransmissions have been made to the Moon, planets and comets with large radio telescopes receiving the reflections, for example JODRELL BANK and ARECIBO . Arecibo has acted as an antenna transmitting signals for Project Ozma. The Haystack antenna (of Lincoln Laboratory) was used to test the theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY in 1967. For a radar pulse passing near the Sun, and reflected from a planet, there should be a small time delay of 2 \u0002 10 \u0003 4 s, equivalent to 60 km (40 mi) difference in the distance of the planet.

They are sometimes known as the Ring-Tail Galaxy. anthropic principle Idea that the existence of the Universe is intimately related to the presence of life. The principle exists in two distinct forms, known as the weak and strong versions. The w eak anthropic principle (WAP) arises from the notion that any observations made by astronomers will be biased by selection effects that arise from their own exis- tence. Characteristics of the Universe that appear to be quite improbable may merely arise from the fact that cer- tain properties are necessary for life to exist. Cosmologist J ohn D. Barrow (1952– ) has given this definition of the W AP: the observed values of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable, but take on values restricted by the requirements that (1) there exist sites where carbon-based life can evolve and (2) the Universe be old enough for it to have already done so. The strong anthropic principle (SAP) goes further, stating that the Universe must have fundamental proper- ties that allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history. This implies that the constants and laws of nature must be such that life can exist. A number of quite distinct interpretations of the SAP are possible, including the sug- gestion that there exists only one possible Universe ‘designed’ with the goal of generating and sustaining ‘observers’ – life. The American mathematician John Archibald Wheeler (1911– ) has pointed out that this argument can be interpreted as implying that observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being, an idea he calls the ‘participatory anthropic principle’ (PAP).

This idea is consistent with the ‘many- w orlds’ or ‘sum-over-histories’ approach of quantum cosmology ( see QU ANTUM GRAVITY ), which requires the existence of many possible real ‘other universes’. antimatter Matter consisting of particles with opposite quantum numbers to normal particles. The marriage of the QU ANTUM THEORY with SPECIAL RELATIVITY led Paul Dirac (1902–84) in 1929 to propose the existence of electrons with positive charge and spin opposite that of normal electrons. This anti-electron, commonly known as a positron, was the first hint that antimatter existed. The tracks characteristic of positrons were subsequently found in COSMIC RAY cloud chamber experiments by Carl Anderson (1905–91) in 1929, proving the existence of these particles and of antimatter in general. Consequently, quantum theorists now associate every known particle with a complementary antiparticle and most have been seen in high-energy physics experiments. If the particle and its antimatter partner interact, they mutually annihilate and the rest mass is converted into electromagnetic energy via Einstein’s formula E = mc 2 . Antimatter has played important roles in cosmology and extragalactic astronomy. The question of why the Universe consists primarily of ordinary matter and very little antimatter has defied explanation. If entire galaxies of antimatter existed, the effects of these galaxies should be seen. These effects have not been observed. It was proposed that quasars might actually be galax- ies of ordinary matter and antimatter galaxies colliding, b ut this model quickly gave way to the more common idea of massive black holes in the centres of protogalax- ies. Antimatter is definitely present in astrophysical objects, but not in significant amounts. For instance, pair production is the creation of an electron–positron pair from a gamma ray scattering off a baryon. This is thought to be a prominent process in both pulsars and quasars. The opposite process, pair annihilation, forms a gamma-ray photon, which has energy of 0.511 MeV (million electron volts); this spectral line is seen in the spectra of A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI (AGN).

Solar radiation pressure drives the dust tails of comets away from the Sun. Under certain circumstances, however, active comets may be observed to have a sunward-pointing ‘spike’ or fan. Such antitails result from ejection of dust from the comet nucleus in thin sheets, which, when viewed in the plane of the comet’s orbit, can appear to point towards the Sun as a result of perspective. P erhaps the best-known example is the antitail sported by Comet AREND – R OLAND in 1957; antitails were also shown by co mets K OHOUTEK and HALE – BOPP . Antlia See feature article Antoniadi, Eugène Michael (1870–1944) French astronomer, born in Turkey of Greek parents, who became an expert observer of planetary features. As a y oung man, Antoniadi made many fine drawings of sunspots and the planets Mars, Jupiter and Saturn using 3- and 4 \u0001 \u0002 -inch (75- and 110-mm) telescopes. This work a ttracted the attention of the French astronomer and writer Camille FLAMMARION , who had built a fine private observatory at Juvisy, France. From 1894 to 1902 Antoniadi used Juvisy’s 9 \u0001 \u0002 -inch (240-mm) Bardou refracting telescope to make detailed studies of the planets, especially Mars. From 1896 to 1917 he directed the British Astronomical Association’s Mars Section, publishing ten Memoirs that collected and discussed the observations of the section’s members; many of the observations were by Antoniadi himself, made with the Juvisy telescope and the great 33-inch (0.83-m) refractor at Meudon, France. At a time when the ‘canals’ supposedly seen on Mars by Giovanni SCHIAPARELLI and Percival LOWELL w ere gener- ally accepted as real features by many astronomers, Anto- niadi interpreted these linear markings as optical illusions produced by the tendency of human vision to transform disconnected features into continuous lines. His observa- tions of Mars during the 1909 opposition convinced him that the canals were natural features similar to Earth’s val- leys; two years later he correctly described the clouds obscuring the planet’s surface as due to windblown sand and dust from the Martian deserts. In 1924 he made one of the first sightings of the Tharsis volcanoes. Antoniadi summarized both his own and historical observations of Mars in the classic book La Planète Mars (1930). Four y ears later he wrote another classic work, La Planète Mer- cure , which remained a standard for decades. Antoniadi w as also an expert on ancient languages, a skill he used to research and write L ’Astronomie Egyptienne (1940). Antoniadi scale Standard scale of SEEING conditions devised in the early 1900s by Eugène ANTONIADI to describe the conditions under which lunar and planetary observations are made. The five gradations on this scale are: (I) perfect seeing, without a quiver; (II) slight undulations, with periods of calm lasting several seconds; (III) moderate seeing, with larger tremors; (IV) poor seeing, with constant troublesome undulations; and (V) very bad seeing, scarcely allowing a rough sketch to be made.

The aperture is the single most important factor in determining both the RESOLVING POWER and light-gathering ability of the instrument. aperture synthesis ARRAY of RADIO TELESCOPES that w ork together to observe the same astronomical object and to produce an image with higher resolution than the telescopes individually could achieve. Resolution approaching that of Earth-bound optical telescopes – say, one arcsecond – would require a single radio dish several kilometres in diameter. To construct such a radio telescope, and make it steerable to observe anywhere in the sky, has been impossible in the past, so aperture synthesis has been a most valuable tool for mapping in detail small-scale structure. The individual radio telescopes play the role of different parts of the surface of a hypothetical ‘super-telescope’, which is synthesized by correctly combining their outputs. The technique is further enhanced by using Earth’s rotation to fill in missing parts of the super-telescope via the movement of the telescopes relative to the astronomical target. This technique of using Earth’s rotation was developed by Martin R YLE . Usually some parts of the super-telescope surface are missing, that is, it is not ‘fully filled’, causing defects in the map such as bands or rings of spurious emission. The problem can be overcome to some extent either by complementing the map with an observation made by a single large radio telescope, or by computing techniques such as maximum-entropy methods which clean up the defects. The Cambridge One-mile telescope and the VERY LARGE ARRAY are examples of aperture synthesis telescopes. apex (solar apex) Point on the CELESTIAL SPHERE towards which the Sun and the entire Solar System appear to be moving, at a velocity of around 19–20 km/s ( c .12 mi/s) relative to nearby stars. It lies in the direction of the constellation Hercules at around RA 18 h dec. \u0001 30º. It is diametrically opposite on the celestial sphere to the ANTAPEX , the direction from which the Sun and Solar System appear to be moving. The apex is also the point on the celestial sphere towards which the Earth appears to be moving at any gi v en time, due to its orbital motion around the Sun. aphelion P oint at which a Solar System body, such as a planet, asteroid or comet, moving in an elliptical orbit, is at its greatest distance from the Sun. For the Earth, this occurs around July 4, when it lies 152 million km (94 million mi) from the Sun. See also APSIDES ; PERIHELION Aphrodite Terra Largest and most extensive of the continent-like highland regions on VENUS . About the size of Africa, Aphrodite Terra exhibits considerable variation in physiography. It extends for 10,000 km (6200 mi) from 45º to 210ºE in a roughly east–west direction along and south of Venus’ equator. The western and central mountainous regions, known respectively as Ovda Regio and Thetis Regio, rise to between 3 and 4 km (1.9–2.5 mi) above the mean planetary radius. East of the central massif is a complex regional fracture system with east-north-east-trending ridges and linear troughs, the most prominent of which are Dali and Diana Chasmata, 2077 km (1291 mi) and 938 km (583 mi) in length respectively. Each trough or rift valley is at least 1 km (0.6 mi) deep. Diana Chasma may be tectonic in origin. To the south is the semicircular Artemis Chasma, thought to be a massive corona-type structure (a concentric arrangement of ridges and grooves). In the east the broad upland dome of Atla Regio, with its fissured surface and v olcanic centres, is somewhat higher than the western and central mountainous districts, but is itself overshadowed by the imposing volcanic peaks Ozza Mons (6 km/4 mi high and 500 km/310 mi across) and Maat Mons (9 km/6 mi high and 395 km/245 mi across). The absence of craters suggests the whole region is of comparatively recent origin. apochromat Composite LENS designed to be free of CHROMATIC ABERRATION . Modern materials and design techniques make it possible to produce lenses that introduce no discernible false colour into the image. Apochromatic refractors used in astronomy usually have an OBJECTIVE made of three separate pieces of glass, each of different materials with different characteristics. Some or all of the materials may be highly specialized and expensive, but the overall effect is to produce some of the best optical systems that are currently available to amateur astronomers. T elescopes incorporating apochromatic objectives are sometimes referred to as ‘fluorites’ or ‘ED’ telescopes, the names being derived from the materials used. Apochromats may also be incorporated into eyepieces and BARLOW LENSES . The smaller sized lenses make these more common and affordable than apochromatic objec- tives. They are particularly useful with reflecting tele- scopes that are inherently free of chromatic aberration.

The archetype, (1862) Apollo, was discovered in 1932 as the first Earth-crossing asteroid. By late 2001 more than 740 Apollo asteroids of va ry ing sizes had been discovered, mostly since 1990. Because these asteroids collide with the Earth or other terrestrial planets on time scales of order ten million y ears, or may be lost through other dynamical paths, they cannot have been in place since the formation of the Solar System. They must, therefore, be delivered to their present orbits on a continual basis. At one time it was thought that they might mostly be extinct cometary nuclei, but it has been shown that they may also be derived from MAIN - BELT ASTEROIDS pumped by Jupiter’s gr a vity out of the KIRKWOOD GAPS and into high- eccentricity orbits in the inner Solar System.

His most famous published work was the eight-volume Conics , which deals with the geometry of conic sections – the circle, ellipse, parabola and h yperbola, all of which are important in describing the motions of celestial bodies. Although Apollonius’ theory of planetary motions was based upon the erroneous geometrical model of epicycles and eccentrics promoted by PTOLEMY , he correctly observed and described the retrograde motion of Mars and other planets. Apollo programme Name given to the US programme to land men on the Moon and return them safely to Earth. The cost of the NATIONAL AERONAUTIC AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION ’s (NASA’s) triumph in the Moon race with the Soviet Union was US$25 billion. At its peak, the programme employed some 500,000 people. The first public announcement of the intention of the USA to achieve the first manned landing on another w orld was made by President Kennedy in 1961. However, NASA was already preparing three series of robotic missions, namely RANGER , SURVEYOR and LUNAR ORBITER , to investigate the feasibility of manned missions and to search for suitable landing sites. The Apollo spacecraft consisted of four units in two pairs: the Command and Service Module (CSM), together with the descent and ascent stages of the LUNAR MODULE (LM). The Command Module (CM) housed the astronauts during the journeys to the Moon and back. It remained attached to the Service Module (SM), which contained the rocket engines, fuel and electrical supply, until shortly before re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere. After achieving lunar orbit, the LM, containing two astronauts, undocked from the CSM, decelerated, and landed at the pre-selected location on the Moon’s surface. The third astronaut remained orbiting the Moon in the CSM. At the completion of extra-vehicular activities (EVAs) on the surface, the descent stage served as a launch platform for the ascent stage, which then redocked with the orbiting CSM. Following the transfer of the two astronauts, film cassettes and Moon rocks from the ascent stage to the CM, the former was jettisoned. It was usually targeted to impact the lunar surface, thereby providing a seismic signal of known energy to calibrate seismometers deployed on the surface. Apollo 1 should have been the first Earth orbital test flight of the CM, but a fire in the CM during ground testing on 1967 January 27 killed astronauts Roger Chaffee (b.1935), Virgil Grissom (b.1926) and Edward White (b.1930) and prompted numerous design changes. This was followed by Apollo 4, 5 and 6, all unmanned flights to test the SATURN ROCKET . The manned flights with three astronauts aboard – the Commander (CDR), the Lunar Module Pilot (LMP) and the Command Module Pilot (CMP) – began with Apollo 7. Originally 14 manned Apollo flights were planned but funding cuts later reduced this to 11. As confidence was gained, each mission gathered more scientific data than its predecessors. As durations of EVAs and distances covered increased, more comprehensive selections of rock and soil samples were obtained.

Within the constraints dictated by spacecraft design and landing safety, the landing sites were chosen to give a reasonably representative selection of different surface types, as determined from earlier ground-based or spacecraft studies. In the case of Apollo 11, a near- equatorial site provided the simplest landing and redocking conditions, with a relatively smooth and level descent path and landing point. A location in Mare Tranquillitatis was chosen, not too far from the impact point of Ranger 8 and the landing point of Surveyor 5. Neil ARMSTRONG and ‘Buzz’ ALDRIN became the first men to step on the Moon. Apollo 12 was again targeted for an equatorial site on Oceanus Procellarum, very close to the earlier landing site of Surveyor 3. This enabled the astronauts to inspect and return spacecraft samples that had been exposed to the lunar environment for two and a half years. The ill-fated Apollo 13 was targeted for Fra Mauro, a near-equatorial site in the lunar highlands that was thought to be covered by ejecta from the impact event that produced the Imbrium Basin. Unfortunately, an o xygen tank in the SM exploded halfway to the Moon, disabling most of the spacecraft systems. Despite many hardships, the astronauts returned safely. Apollo 14 was targeted for the same landing location and was completely successful. The exploration by astronauts Alan SHEPARD and Stuart Roosa (1933– ) was aided by a wheeled trolley known as the Modular Equipment Transporter. The three remaining missions touched down well away from the equator and had the benefit of a battery- powered roving vehicle that widened the field of exploration. The Apollo 15 landing site combined a mare region (Palus Putredinis), a nearby sinuous valley (Hadley Rille) and very high mountains (the Apennines). Apollo 16 landed in a highlands area, on the so-called Cayley Formation – the loose material that fills in craters and covers the lower slopes here – but very close to the Descartes Formation, which was thought to represent possible highlands volcanism. The choice of the Taurus-Littrow site for the final mission resulted largely from the Apollo 15 observations of small, dark-haloed craters, identified as possible v olcanic vents, in the area. Additionally, the valley floor w as one of the darkest mare surfaces on the Moon. Geologist-astronaut Harrison Schmitt (1935– ) was the only scientist to set foot on the Moon. The quantity of data resulting from the Apollo programme was overwhelming. The 380 kg of rock and soil samples have attracted particular attention, having been subjected to every kind of test and analysis imaginable. However, many of the stored samples have y et to be examined. Another major archive is the collection of many thousands of photographs taken during the transit and orbital phases of the missions. In particular, the metric and panoramic cameras used on the last three missions produced high-resolution, wide-angle, stereoscopic coverage of about 20% of the lunar surface. Of the 16 or so other experiments conducted from orbit, ten were concerned with ‘remote sensing’, allowing a comparison with data from the landing sites. About 25 different types of experiment were carried out or deployed on the surface. These included seismometers, magnetometers and heat-flow experiments to investigate the subsurface structure and properties. Laser reflectors helped to refine the Moon–Earth distance. apparent magnitude Apparent brightness of a star (a measure of the light received at Earth) measured by the stellar magnitude system. Because stars are at different distances from us and the interstellar medium has a va r iable absorption, apparent magnitude is not a reliable key to a star’s real (intrinsic) LUMINOSITY . apparent solar time Local time, based on the position of the Sun in the sky, and as shown by a sundial. Apparent noon occurs when the Sun crosses the local MERIDIAN at its maximum altitude. The length of a solar day measured this way is not uniform. It varies throughout the year by as much as 16 minutes because of the elliptical orbit of the Earth and the fact that the Sun appears to move across the sky along the ecliptic, rather than the celestial equator. Clock time is therefore based on the uniform movement of a fictitious mean Sun. The difference between apparent and MEAN SOLAR TIME is called the EQUATION OF TIME . apparition Pe r iod of time during which it is possible to observe a celestial body that is only visible periodically. The term is usually used to describe a particular appearance of a comet, such as the 1985–86 apparition of Comet HALLEY . appulse Close approach in apparent position in the sky between two celestial bodies. Unlike an OCCULTATION , when one body passes directly in front of another, such as a planet occulting a star, an appulse occurs when their directions of motion on the celestial sphere converge, the two just appearing to touch. The impression is caused by a line-of-sight effect, the two bodies actually lying at greatly differing distances from the observer.

Ap star Class ASTAR with peculiar chemical composition. Ap stars extend to types Fp and Bp. In these class 2 CHEMICALLY PECULIAR STARS (CP2), elements such as silicon, chromium, strontium and the rare earths are enhanced (europium by a factor of 1000 or more). The odd compositions derive from diffusion, in which some atoms sink in the quiet atmospheres of slowly rotating stars, whereas others rise. The strong, tilted magnetic fields of Ap stars concentrate element enhancements near the magnetic poles. As the stars rotate, both the fields and spectra vary. Apus See feature article Aquarius See feature article Aquila See feature article Ara See feature article Arab astronomy See ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY Arago, (Dominique) François (Jean) (1786–1853) French scientist and statesman, director of Paris Observatory from 1830, who pioneered the application of the photometer and polarimeter to astrophysics. He discovered that two beams of light polarized at right angles do not interfere with each other, allowing him to develop the transverse theory of light waves. Arago supervised the construction in 1845 of Paris Observatory’s 380-mm (15-in.) refractor, at the time one of the world’s largest telescopes. Aratus of Soli (315–245 BC ) Ancient Greek poet (born in what is now modern Turkey) whose Phaenomena elaborated upon the descriptions of the ‘classical’ constellations given a century before by EUDOXUS . Aratus’ patron, King Antigonus of Macedonia, was so inspired by the Phaenomena that he had the constellation figures described in the epic poem painted on the concave ceilings of the royal palace, thus creating what was probably the earliest celestial atlas. Arcetri Astrophysical Observatory Observatory of the University of Florence, situated at Arcetri, south of the city. The present observatory was built by Giovanni DONATI in 1872, replacing a much older one in the city centre. A solar tower was added in 1924. Arcetri is now a major centre of Italian astrophysics, and its scientists use both national ( GALILEO NATIONAL TELESCOPE ) and international (mainly EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY ) facilities. It has a major role in the development of the LARGE BINOCULAR TELESCOPE . archaeoastronomy Study of ancient, essentially prehistoric, astronomical theories and practices through evidence provided by archaeology, the interpretation of ancient artefacts, the written records (if available) and ethnological sources such as tribal legends (sometimes called ethnoastronomy). Many ancient peoples – for example the Stone Age populations of the European countries and the Eastern Mediterranean – are known to have been fully aware of celestial phenomena, as manifested in the alignments of their megalithic monuments such as Stonehenge, New- g range and the dolmens of north-west France. Measure- ments of the Egyptian pyramids show that they are orientated within a small fraction of a degree in the north–south and east–west directions, and this must have required considerable practical observational skill ( see EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMY ). Ancient astronomical observations were not limited to the Old World: for example, Meso-American peoples such as the Maya ( see NATIVE AMERICAN ASTRONOMY ) and the Aztec have left codices and other evidence which reveal knowledge of celestial events and the determination of celestial cycles. In some ancient civilizations, observation of the HELI - A CAL RISING of Sirius provided a reference point that enabled their luni-solar calendar to be corrected to match the true solar year. This was essential to the civili- sation if the calendar was to be used to decide the prop- er time for planting crops. What may be called applied historical astronomy makes use of ancient records to derive data of value to modern astronomical research. For example, ancient observations of eclipses from Babylon, China, Europe and the Islamic world can be used to determine the variation in the Earth’s rotational period over the past 2700 years. In addition, ancient records of the extremely rare outbursts of supernovae, often recorded as ‘guest’ or ‘new’ stars, are Ap star 24 A APUS ( GEN . APODIS , ABBR .

An arcminute (symbol \u0001 ) is 1/60 of a degree and an arcsecond (symbol \u0002 ) 1/60 of an arcminute, or 1/360 of a degree.

Arecibo Observatory Site of the world’s largest single- dish radio telescope, and one of the most important facilities for radio astronomy, planetary radar and terrestrial atmospheric studies. The observatory is located in the Guarionex Mountains of north-western Puerto Rico about 12 km (8 mi) south of the city of Arecibo. A natural depression provided a bowl in which the 300-m (1000-ft) spherical reflector was built by Cornell University, beginning in 1960. The telescope was dedicated in 1963 November as the Arecibo Ionospheric Observatory, with radar studies of the Earth’s atmosphere and the planets as its primary mission. In 1971, with radio astronomy investigations increasing, it became part of the National Astronomy and Ionospheric Centre (NAIC) operated by Cornell, and in 1974 the mirror’s surface was upgraded to allow centimetre-wavelength observations to be made. This event was celebrated by the transmission of the coded Arecibo message towards the globular cluster M13, some 25,000 l.y. away, containing information about terrestrial civilization. The telescope was further upgraded in 1997. The fixed, upward-pointing dish is 51 m (167 ft) deep, covers 8 hectares (20 acres) and is surfaced with almost 40,000 perforated aluminium panels supported by a network of steel cables underneath. Suspended 137 m (450 ft) above the dish is a 915-tonne platform in which the telescope’s highly sensitive radio receivers are located.

Comet Arend–Roland reached perihelion, 0.32 AU from the Sun, on 1957 April 8. After perihelion, the comet came closest to Earth (0.57 AU) on April 21, becoming a prominent naked-eye object in northern hemisphere skies in the latter parts of the month.

Argelander, Friedrich Wilhelm August (1799–1875) German astronomer, born in Memel (in modern Lithuania), noted for his compilation of fundamental star catalogues and atlases. From 1817 to 1822 Argelander w orked at the observatory of the University of Königsberg, under its director Friedrich Wilhelm BESSEL . There he revised the positions of 2848 bright stars catalogued by John FLAMSTEED , amongst the first compiled after the invention of the telescope. In 1823 Argelander became director of the Finnish observatory at Tu rku and, later, Helsinki, where he remained until his appointment as director of the Bonn Observatory in 1836. In 1843 he published Uranometria nova , a catalogue of positions and magnitudes for stars visible to the naked eye; for this project, Argelander invented his ‘stepwise method’ of estimating a star’s visual magnitude by comparing it to the relative brightness of neighbouring stars. Argelander’s greatest cartographic achievement was the BONNER DURCHMUSTERUNG (BD). Employing Bonn Observatory’s 75-mm (3-in.) Fraunhofer ‘comet seeker’ 25 A ARA ( GEN . ARAE , ABBR .

The Mariner spacecraft identified it as a basin 900 km (560 mi) in diameter, with a featureless floor covered by dust deposits. The floor is a light ochre colour when it is not covered by ice-fogs or frosts. The basin was formed by a meteoroid impact which created its 3-km-high (1.9-mi-high) mountainous rims. It is encircled by Nereidum Montes, on the north, and Charitum Montes, on the south. Ariane Fleet of European satellite launchers developed by the EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY and operated by Arianespace, a commercial satellite launching company. Arianespace became operational in 1981, two years after the maiden flight of Ariane 1. Further Ariane 2 and 3 models were developed and the present fleet consists of six types of Ariane 4 and an initial version of Ariane 5, four more models of which are under development. The Ariane 4 fleet will be retired in 2002–2003, leaving the Ariane 5 models in service, complemented by a fleet of smaller Vega boosters and Eurockot and Soyuz vehicles, operated by associated companies, for launches of lighter payloads into low Earth and other orbits. The major market for the Ariane 4 and 5 fleets is geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), the staging post for flights to equatorial geostationary orbit, using spacecraft on-board propulsion units. Launches take place from Kourou, French Guiana, which being located close the equator provides cost- and fuel-effective launches. Communications satellites weighing up to 6 tonnes are being launched to GTO. On some flights, two smaller satellites can be launched together, reducing the launch cost for the customer. An Ariane launch costs in the region of US$100 million. The six Ariane 4 models pro- vide a capability of placing 2.1–4.4 tonnes into GTO, with one model with no strap-on boosters and five with two to four solid or liquid boosters or combinations of these. Ari- ane 5 can place 6 tonnes into GTO. Four new Ariane 5 models, the 5E/S, 5E/SV, 5/ECA and 5/ECB, will improve GTO performance to between 7.1 and 12 tonnes. Ariel Icy SATELLITE of URANUS , discovered in 1851 by William LASSELL . Ariel has a highly fractured surface, in marked contrast to its similar-size neighbour, UMBRIEL . Most fractures are paired to produce valleys with down- dropped floors, known as GRABENS . These fractures may have been caused by stresses induced by TIDES . Alterna- tively, if the interior had frozen after originally been molten, they could have been produced by the stretching of Ariel’s LITHOSPHERE . Many areas, particularly valley floors, can be seen to have been flooded by some kind of viscous fluid during an episode of CRYOVOLCANISM . This flooding may have been a result of TIDAL HEATING , although Ariel no longer shares orbital RESONANCE with any other satellite of Uranus. Past heating events may have been sufficient to allow a small rocky CORE to settle out at Ariel’s centre by DIFFERENTIATION . The ice of which most of Ariel’s volume is composed is believed to be rich in ammonia, although this has not been detected by spectroscopy. Ammonia-water ices have the remarkable property of being able to liberate small per- centages of melt at temperatures as low as 176 K. As this is only about 100 K warmer than Ariel’s present surface temperature, it goes some way to explaining the former molten nature of the interior and the apparent ease with which cryovolcanic melts have been able to reach and spread over the surface. However, even the youngest areas are scarred by abundant impact craters, indicating that Ariel was last geologically active a long time, maybe 2 bil- lion years, ago. See data at URANUS Ariel Series of six UK scientific satellites launched between 1962 and 1979. The first five were a collaboration with the USA.

Aristarchus reflects 20% of the sunlight falling upon it, which gives it an ALBEDO about twice that of typical lunar features. Its outer ramparts are highlighted by a white blanket of EJECTA , and its brilliant rays radiate south and south-east. It is possible to see Aristarchus by EARTHSHINE . The crater w alls are terraced through a drop of 3000 m (10,000 ft) to the lava-flooded floor, which is only half the diameter of the crater, supporting a small central peak. The dark ve r tical bands visible on the inner walls of Aristarchus are likely an effect of offsetting from the landslips that formed its terraces. With neighbouring HERODOTUS and Vallis SCHRÖTERI , this impact crater has long been the focus of intensive study. Many LUNAR TRANSIENT PHENOMENA have been observed here. There is evidence of volcanic activity, including plentiful volcanic domes, rilles and areas of fire fountaining. Aristarchus of Samos ( c .310– c .230 BC ) Greek astronomer and mathematician who measured the distances of the Sun and Moon, and who is also cited as the first astronomer to propound a heliocentric theory. Aristarchus reckoned the Sun’s and Moon’s distances by measuring the apparent angle between the Earth and Sun during the first quarter Moon, when the Moon–Sun angle is 90º. Though his method was mathematically v alid, the exact moment at which the Moon was 50% illuminated proved very difficult to measure in practice, and any slight error in its value would introduce gross errors in the final result. Aristarchus observed the Sun–Earth–Moon angle as 87º, determining that the Sun w as twenty times as far from the Earth as the Moon, and hence was twenty times the actual size of our natural satellite. Because the actual angle at first quarter is 89º 50 \u0001 , the Sun is really about 400 times as distant, but Aristarchus’ result, announced in his work On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon , nevertheless demonstrated that the Sun is a much more distant celestial object than the nearby Moon. The idea of a moving Earth seems to have originated with the followers of Pythagoras ( c .580–500 BC ), though they had it orbiting a central fire, not the Sun. But according to Archimedes ( c .287–212 BC ) and Plutarch ( AD 46–120), it was Aristarchus who put the Sun at the centre of a very large Universe where the stars were ‘fixed’ and only appeared to move because of the Earth’s rotation on its axis. Aristarchus’ hypothesis called for a circular Earth orbit, but that could not account for the unequal lengths of the seasons and other irregularities, while a moving Earth was contrary to ancient Greek cos- mology; his heliocentric model was therefore not accept- ed in his own day. Aristotle (384–322 BC ) Greek philosopher and polymath who developed a cosmology based upon a ‘perfect’ Earth-centred Universe. In 367 BC he enrolled at Plato’s Academy, where he studied under EUDOXUS ; in 335 BC he founded his own school at Athens, called the Lyceum. It was there that Aristotle developed a cosmology incorporating the ‘four elements’ of earth, air, fire and water, and the four ‘fundamental qualities’ – hot, cold, dry and wet. These ideas led him to reject the idea of a vacuum and, therefore, any atomic theory, because this demanded the presence of particles existing in empty space. Aristotle also considered and rejected any idea of a moving Earth. Aristotle taught that the Universe was spherical, with the Sun, Moon and planets carried round on concentric spheres nesting inside one another. The Earth itself was a sphere, Aristotle reasoned, because of the shape of the shadow cast on the Moon in a lunar eclipse. All these celestial bodies w ere eternal and unchanging, and he thought of them being composed of a fifth element or essence. The outermost sphere carried the ‘fixed stars’; it controlled the other spheres, and was itself controlled by a supernatural ‘prime mover’. In Aristotle’s Universe everything had its natural place. ‘Earthy’ materials fell downwards because they sought their natural place at the centre of the spherical Earth, which was itself at the centre of the Universe. Water lay in a sphere covering the Earth, hence its tendency to ‘find its o wn level’. Outside the sphere of water lay that of the air, and beyond this was the sphere of fire; flames always bu r ned upwards because they were seeking their natural place above the air. Change was confined to the terrestrial w orld, the ‘sublunary’ region lying inside the Moon’s sphere. As a result meteors, comets and other transitory events were thought to occur in the upper air; they were classified as meteorological phenomena. The Aristotelian world-view, as modified by Ptolemy, w ould hold sway for nearly two millennia, thanks in part to its incorporation into the doctrines of the Catholic Church.

A series of r ings represent great circles such as the equator and the ecliptic, while other rings represent the observer’s horizon and meridian.

From his studies of galaxies, galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), Arp proposed that AGNs, which often display very high redshifts, are ejected from the cores of nearby active galaxies with lower redshifts, the higher apparent redshifts of the AGNs being the result of the violent ejection process. array Arrangement of RADIO TELESCOPES or ANTENNAE w orking together, most commonly in RADIO ASTRONOMY , to improve the resolution of the image created.

Most of these carried single satellites, but it is increasingly common for two or more to be carried by one launch vehicle. At the same time, other objects such as the upper rocket stage and protective nose cone may also be released, creating a cloud of artificial debris – an undesirable class of satellites – around Earth. All satellites move in elliptical orbits governed by NEWTON ’ SL AW SO FM O TION . However, the orbit is modi- fied continuously by external forces, such as friction with the upper atmosphere and variations in the gravitational pull of the Earth. The rates of change depend on the height of the satellite and the inclination of the orbital plane to the equator. Changes in the density of the atmosphere, due princi- pally to solar activity, cause variable drag on a satellite. The overall effect is to change the ECCENTRICITY , with the orbit becoming more and more circular. Eventually, the satellite will spiral inwards and experience increasing drag until it finally plunges into the denser regions of the a tmosphere and burns up. Other factors affecting a satellite’s orbit include atmos- pheric tides and winds, whether the PERIGEE of the orbit occurs in the northern or southern hemisphere and the local times at which this occurs. Solar radiation pressure has a major effect on satellites with a large area/mass ratio, such as those with large solar arrays. The overall result is that no satellite can have a stable orbit below a height of about 160 km (100 mi). At this height the orbital period is about 88 minutes. Satellites are generally classified as military or civil, although there is considerable overlap. About 25% of cur- rent launches are for military purposes, such as photo- reconnaissance, communications, electronic listening and navigation. Categorizing US military satellites is fairly straightforward, but Russian or Chinese sources rarely divulge the purposes of their military satellites. For exam- ple, the 2386 Russian Cosmos satellites launched by the end of 2001 included all types of experimental, scientific and military spacecraft. Common names are used extensively instead of techni- cal designations. Such names as Spot, Landsat, Meteosat and Mir are well known, but confusion may arise when two organizations use the same or similar names. For example, the US GEOS was used for geodetic studies, while the EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY used the same name for a satellite that investigated charged particles in the upper atmosphere. Acronyms have been used widely, adding to the confusion. Fo r tunately, COSPAR (International Committee for Space Research) has provided a standard system for iden- tifying all satellites and related fragments, based on the y ear of launch and the chronological order of successful launches in that year. For example, the MIR space station, launched on 1986 February 19, was known as 1986-17A, since it was the 17th launch in 1986. The A referred to the satellite. The rocket that put it into orbit was designated 1986-17B. If several satellites are launched by a single rocket, they are usually given the letters A, B, C, and so on. If more than 24 fragments are created by an explosion, the letter Z is followed by AA, AB, ..., BA, BB, ..., and so on. Before 1963 a system involving Greek letters was used. For example, Sputnik 3 was designated 1958 \u0001 2 whilst the associated rocket was known as 1958 \u0001 1. Photographic, visual and laser techniques are all used to track satellites. However, most satellites are tracked through their telemetry, by measuring the phase difference between a signal transmitted from the ground and a return signal from the satellite. This method can determine an Earth orbiting satellite’s distance to within 10 m (33 ft). If the sky is clear, satellites can be seen after dusk or just before dawn, when the sky is dark but the satellite is still illuminated by the Sun. The length of these visibility peri- ods depends on the time of the year, the latitude of the observer and the orbit of the satellite. The satellite’s brightness depends on the nature and curvature of the reflecting surface, the PHASE ANGLE (the angle between the Sun and the observer as seen from the satellite) and its distance and altitude from the observer. Some objects, such as the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION , rival the brightest planets, but others can only be seen through medium-sized telescopes. The rate at which satellites cross the sky depends on their height above the Earth. Low satellites may cross the sky in about 2 minutes, but those at heights of about 2000 km (1200 mi) may take half an hour. Satellites at heights of about 36,000 km (22,400 mi) take 24 hours to complete one revolution. If the orbital inclination is 0º, the satellite appears motionless in the sky. Many meteorologi- cal and communication satellites have been launched into these GEOSTATIONARY ORBITS . Roughly two-thirds of all the satellites launched have been from the former Soviet Union and most of these have been from the northern launch complex at Plesetsk, near Archangel. The other main launch site in the former Soviet Union is at BAIKONUR (Tyuratam), north-east of the Aral Sea. A relatively small number of satellites have been launched from Kapustin Yar, near Volgograd, and a new Russian launch site is being developed at Svobodny in the Russian Far East. The Americans have three main launch sites: Cape Canaveral in Florida, Vandenberg Air Force Base in Cal- ifornia and Wallops Island in Virginia. A number of commercial launch sites are also being developed for small rockets. In recent years, as other nations have begun to develop their space industries, launch sites have sprung up in South America and Asia. European ARIANE rockets lift off from Kourou in French Guiana. Japan uses two southern sites, Kagoshima and Tanegashima. India’s main launch centre is on Sriharikota Island, northeast of Madras. China has three main launch centres, at Jiuquan, Taiyuan and Xichang, in the less populated areas of north, west and southwest China respectively. The most recent innovation is the development of an ocean-going launch platform for the US–Ukraine–Norway SEA LAUNCH programme.

Sometimes the entire night hemisphere is affected, at other times the glow is patchy and localized, b ut it has no preferred position. In appearance the phenomenon is analogous to earthshine, although it is produced in a very different way. The ashen light was apparently seen by Giovanni Battista RICCIOLI in 1643, b ut it was first accurately described in 1715 by the English cleric William Derham, Canon of Windsor. It is possibly the oldest unsolved mystery in the observational history of the Solar System. The ashen light phenomenon is rare, fugitive and sus- pect. It is only seen, and then with extreme difficulty, if V enus is observed on a dark sky and has its bright part hidden by an occulting device located inside the eyepiece of the telescope. Even this precaution is insufficient to dis- pel thoughts of illusion, and in the absence of photograph- ic confirmation there is a natural tendency towards scepticism. Still, too many experienced observers have claimed sightings of ashen light to completely discount the phenomenon. V olcanic activity, phosphorescence of the surface, self- luminosity, accidental combustion and other illuminating processes, including lightning, have all been proposed by wa y of explanation. The only conceivable physical mecha- nism that would be dependent on the phase or position of V enus as viewed from Earth would in fact be earthlight, b ut calculation clearly demonstrates that theoretical earth- light falls well below the threshold of visibility. Possibly the cause is to be found in an electrical phenomenon in V enus’ upper atmosphere. Another possibility emerged in 1983 when David A. Allen (1946–94) and John W. Craw- ford imaged the planet in infrared and found cloud pat- terns on its night side. These clouds, with a retrograde rotation period of 5.4 \u0004 0.1 days, are thought to be at a lower level than the ultraviolet features and may be suffi- ciently lit by radiation scattered from the day side to become visible occasionally in integrated light.

The angle on the celestial sphere between the Sun and another Solar System body is known as the ELONGATION of that body. When the elongation is 0º, that body is said to be at CONJUNCTION . When it is 180º, and the two are opposite one another in the sky, it is at OPPOSITION . When the elongation is 90º, the body is at QUA DRATURE . association, stellar Group of stars that have formed together but that are more loosely linked than in a star cluster. Stellar associations lie in the spiral arms of the Galaxy and help to define the shape of the arms, being highly luminous. OB ASSOCIATIONS are groups of massive O and B stars. R associations illuminate REFLECTION NEBULAE and are similar stars but of slightly lower mass (3 to 10 solar masses). T ASSOCIATIONS are groups of T TA URI STARS . Association of Lunar and Planetary Observers (ALPO) Organization of amateur observers that collects reports of observations of all Solar System objects (Sun, Moon, planets, comets, meteors and meteorites), founded in 1947. These observations, especially of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, are summarized annually in the organization’s J ournal , which provides synopses of notable happenings on these dynamic bodies. Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) Consortium of US universities and other educational and non-profit organizations; it was founded in 1957. It operates world-class astronomical observatories. Current members include 29 US institutions and six international affiliates.

In addition, AURA has a New Initiatives Office formally established in J anuary 2001 to work towards the goal of a 30-m (98-ft) GIANT SEGMENTED - MIRROR TELESCOPE . A star Member of a class of white stars, the spectra of which are characterized by strong hydrogen ABSORPTION LINES . Ionized metals are also present. MAIN - SEQUENCE dwarf A stars (five times more common than B stars) range from 7200 K at A9 to 9500 K at A0. Their zero-age masses range from 1.6 to 2.2 times that of the Sun, and their zero-age luminosities from 6 to 20 times that of the Sun. Their lifetimes range from 2.5 billion to 900 million y ears. Evolved A DWARF S T ARS can have masses up to three times that of the Sun. Class A GIANT STARS and SUPERGIANTS are distinguished by the narrowing of the h ydrogen lines with increasing luminosity. Though A dwarfs can rotate rapidly, averaging from 100 km/s (60 mi/s) at A9 to 180 km/s (110 mi/s) at A0, their envelopes are not in a state of convection, and they lack solar-type chromospheres. A dwarfs exhibit a variety of spectral anomalies, especially among the slower rota- tors. Metallic-line AM STARS are depleted in calcium and scandium, while enriched in copper, zinc and the rare earths. The AP STARS (A-peculiar) have strong magnetic fields that range to 30,000 gauss. They exhibit enhance- ments of silicon, chromium, strontium and the rare earths (europium is enriched by over 1000 times), which are concentrated into magnetic starspots. These odd compo- sitions result principally from diffusion, in which some chemical elements gravitationally settle, while others are lofted upwards by radiation. Rare LAMBDA BOÖTIS stars have weak metal lines. DELTA SCUTI STARS (Population IA dwarfs and sub- g iants) pulsate in under a day with multiple periods and amplitudes of a few hundredths of a magnitude (the large- amplitude variety are known as dwarf Cepheids).

Perhaps the most famous asterism is the PLOUGH (Big Dipper), a shape formed by seven stars in Ursa Major. Other famous asterisms within individual constellations include the SICKLE OF LEO and the TEAPOT in Sagittarius. The SQUARE OF PEGASUS is an example of an asterism that is composed of stars from two constellations (in this case, Andromeda and Pegasus); another is the SUMMER TRIANGLE . The term is also used for smaller groupings of stars visible in binoculars or telescopes, some of which have been given descriptive names such as the COATHANGER (in Vulpecula) and Kemble’s Cascade (in CAMELOPARDALIS ). asteroid (minor planet) Rocky, metallic body, smaller in size than the major planets, found throughout the Solar System. The majority of the known asteroids orbit the Sun in a band between Mars and Jupiter known as the MAIN BELT , but asteroids are also found elsewhere. There is a population known as NEAR - EARTH ASTEROIDS , which approach the orbit of our planet, making impacts possible. Other distinct asteroid classes include the TROJAN ASTEROIDS , which have the same orbital period as Jupiter but avoid close approaches to that planet. Farther out in the Solar System are two further categories of body that are at present classed as asteroids, although in physical nature they may have more in common with comets in that they seem to have largely icy compositions. These are the CENTAURS and the TRANS - NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS , members of the EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT . Although it is likely that there might be larger bodies in the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt awaiting discovery ( see VA R UNA ), the largest asteroid in the inner Solar System is (1) CERES , which is c .933 km ( c .580 mi) in diameter. It w as discovered in 1801. Through a telescope, asteroids generally appear as pin-pricks of light, which led to the coining of the term ‘asteroid’, meaning ‘star-like’, by William HERSCHEL . Broadly spherical shapes are attained by asteroids if their self-gravity is sufficient to overcome the tensile strength of the materials of which they are composed, setting a lower limit for sphericity of about 200 km (120 mi); there are about 25 main-belt asteroids larger than this. All other asteroids are expected to be irregular in shape ( see CASTALIA , DEIMOS , EROS , GASPRA , GEOGRAPHOS , GOLEVKA , IDA , KLEOPATRA , MATHILDE , PHOBOS , T OUTATIS , VESTA ). Use of the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE , sophisticated techniques employing ground- based telescopes and the application of radar imaging have recently led to the ability to resolve the shapes of some asteroids. OCCULTATIONS also allow asteroid sizes and shapes to be determined observationally: on rare occasions when asteroids pass in front of brighter stars, observers on the ground may see a fading or disappearance of the star, the duration of which (usually a few seconds) defines a cord across the asteroid profile. Fo r many asteroids, sizes have been calculated on the basis of a comparison of their brightness both in scattered visible light from the Sun and also in the thermal infrared radiation emitted, which balances the solar flux they absorb. Such measurements allow the ALBEDO to be derived. In most cases, however, sizes are estimated simply on the basis of the observed absolute magnitude and an assumed value for the albedo. The lower limit on size at which a solid body might be considered to be an asteroid is a matter of contention. Before the application of photography, starting in the 1890s, asteroids were discovered visually. Long photographic exposures on wide-field instruments, such as astrographic cameras and Schmidt telescopes, led to many thousands of asteroids being detected thereafter. However, the limited sensitivity of photographic emulsions makes it impossible to detect asteroids smaller than a few hundred metres in size, even if they are in the vicinity of the Earth. In the late 1980s the introduction by the SPACEWATCH project of charge-coupled devices for asteroid searching made it feasible to detect objects only a handful of metres in size during passages through cis-lunar space. A convenient size at which to draw a line is 10m (30ft): larger solid objects may be regarded as being asteroids, while smaller ones may be classed as METEOROIDS . The total mass of all the asteroids in the inner Solar System (interior to Jupiter’s orbit) is about 4 \u0001 10 21 kg, which is about 5% of the mass of the Moon. A large fraction of that total is held in the three largest asteroids, Ceres, P ALLAS and Vesta. A decreasing fraction of the ov erall mass is represented by the smaller asteroids: although there may be over a million main-belt asteroids each about 1 km (0.6 mi) in diameter, their total mass is less than that of a single asteroid of diameter 200 km (120 mi). As a rule of thumb the number of asteroids increases by about a factor of one hundred for each tenfold decrease in size. Because the mass depends upon the cube of the linear dimension, the smaller asteroids thus represent a decreasing proportion of the total mass of the population. When an asteroid is found its position is reported to the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center, and it is allotted a preliminary designation. This is of the form nnnn pq, where nnnn is the year and pq represents two upper-case letters. The first letter (p) denotes the half-month in which the discovery was made, J anuary 1–15 being labelled A, January 16–31 as B, and so on. The letter I is not used, so that December 16–31 is labelled Y in this convention, and the letter Z is also not used. The second letter (q) provides an identifier for the particular asteroid; in this case Z is used but not I, making 25 letters/asteroids in all. Thus the third asteroid reported in the second half of March 1989 was labelled as 1989 FC. Until the last couple of decades this designation system was adequate because no more than 25 asteroids w ere being discovered in any half-month, but now thousands are reported and so an additional identifier is required. This takes the form of a subscripted numeral. Thus 1999 LD 31 w as the 779th asteroid reported in the first half of June 1999. Many asteroids are reported 31 A Sun Earth Mars Jupiter \u0001 asteroid Plots of the larger known asteroids: most of them lie in the main belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, while the Trojans move in the same orbit as Jupiter, 60 \u0002 in front of or behind it.

After an asteroid has been observed for a sufficient length of time, such that our determination of its orbit is secure (this generally requires three oppositions), it is allocated a number in the master list, which begins with (1) Ceres and continues with (2) Pallas, (3) Juno, (4) V esta and so on. This list exceeded 25,000 during the y ear 2001. Upon numbering, the discoverers of each asteroid have the right to suggest a name for it to the naming committee of the International Astronomical Union, and in most cases that suggestion is adopted. Certain conventions apply to distinct categories of asteroid, such as the Trojans and the Centaurs. In the past, before strict rules were adopted for numbering and naming, a few exceptions to these procedures occurred, such as with ALBERT and HERMES . Although some asteroids may be cometary nuclei that have become dormant or extinct, most of these bodies are thought to have originated in the region of the present main belt. They seem to be the remnant debris from a large complex of PLANETESIMALS that failed to form a major planet due to the gravitational stirring effect of Jupiter. Soon after their formation, some of the larger proto-asteroids underwent sufficient internal heating, through radioactive decay, to melt to some degree, acquiring metallic cores and layered mantles. This chemical DIFFERENTIATION is represented in the va r iety of known METEORITE classes – these being in effect asteroid fragments. A consequence of this differentiation is that asteroids present a variety of spectroscopic classes, representing different surface (and, assumedly, bulk) compositions. The most abundant group is called C-type (for ‘carbonaceous’) asteroids, these being especially prevalent as one moves outwards through the main belt. C-type asteroids reflect more light at the red end of the spectrum, b ut their low albedos (below 0.05) make them very dark, so they may be thought of as being black-brown. They are thought to contain the same materials as CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITE meteorites. The inner part of the main belt is dominated by S-type (stony or ‘silicaceous’) asteroids. These have moderate albedos (0.15–0.25) and are thought to be analogous to the metal-bearing stony meteorites known as ordinary CHONDRITES . The third most populous class are the M- type (‘metallic’) asteroids. These also have moderate albedos and are thought to be derived, like nickel-iron meteorites, from the metal-rich cores of large differentiated parent bodies that have become exposed by collisional break-up. Members of a less common class, the E-types (‘enstatite’), have elevated albedos of 0.40 or more, as has the V-class Vesta. There are many other subdivisions of each of these classes, and other rare categories that have been recognized as being distinct from the common groupings. The distributions of the va r ious asteroid types in the main belt – the preponderance of S-types at the inner edge but with more C-types at greater distances – suggest that the volatile- r ich asteroids formed farther from the Sun, as a result of the presumed temperature gradient in the SOLAR NEBULA . Similarly, the homogeneous composition of the HIRAYAMA F AMILIES suggests that most asteroids remain in orbits similar to those where they formed in that nebula. Another important clue to the nature of asteroids comes from their spin rates. The rotation period of an asteroid may be measured from observations of its repeating trends in brightness variation, generally displaying two maxima and two minima in each revolution. This pattern indicates that the changes in brightness are dominated by the effect of the asteroid’s non-spherical shape, rather than any albedo distribution across its surface. Typical amplitudes are only up to 0.2 mag., or 20% in the brightness, although some near- Earth asteroids, such as Geographos, vary by a much g reater amount, as a result of their elongated shapes. T ypically, asteroids have rotation periods in the order of ten hours, although a few are much longer (some w eeks), possibly due to the damping effect of a companion satellite (as with Ida, EUGENIA and PULCOVA ). At the other end of the scale, short rotation periods are of interest because self-gravitation cannot hold together an asteroid having a rotation period of less than about two hours. Until recently all asteroids for which light curves were available displayed periods in excess of this amount, meaning that they could be ‘rubble piles’ held together by gravity. (Another piece of evidence pointing to such a structure is the presence of voids within asteroids, as indicated by the low average densities determined for some of them, for example Ceres and Mathilde.) The first asteroid to be measured to have a shorter period (about 97 minutes) was 1995 HM, which thus appears to be a monolith. Since then several other asteroids have been shown to have even higher spin rates, with periods as short as ten minutes. These must similarly be single rocks rather than rubble piles, being held together by their tensile strength. The meteoroids that produce meteorites, and indeed some complete asteroids, leave the main belt through a va r iety of mechanisms. Inter-asteroid collisions may g rossly change their orbits (evidence of past collisions derives from the Hirayama families), and such collisions also change the spin rates discussed above. A more significant avenue through which asteroids can escape the main belt is the rapid dynamical evolution that occurs if an object acquires an orbital period that is a simple fraction of that of Jupiter. This leads to depleted regions of orbital space known as the KIRKWOOD GAPS . Asteroids leaving those regions tend to acquire high-eccentricity orbits, which can lead to them either being ejected from the Solar System by Jupiter, or else joining the population of MARS - CROSSING ASTEROIDS or near-Earth asteroids. Viewed in three dimensions, the main belt is a somewhat wedge-shaped torus, increasing in thickness from its inner to its outer edge. The median inclination increases from about 5º to about 9º, whereas the median orbital eccentricity is around 0.15 throughout the main belt. Most asteroids, therefore, follow heliocentric orbits that are only a little more inclined than those of the planets, and with modestly greater eccentricities. It follows that the majority of main-belt asteroids move among the stars, as seen from the Earth, in a similar way to the planets: they stay close to the ecliptic, and retrograde through opposition. There are, however, exceptions among various dynamical classes such as the near-Earth asteroids, the Trojans, and various specific main-belt classes that are grouped together in terms of common dynamical behaviour rather than composition or origin. asteroid belt General term for the region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter in which the orbits of most asteroids lie.

At the asthenosphere the rise in temperature with depth reaches the threshold at which plastic flow may occur in response to small stress differences. In the case of the Earth, seismological evidence – the attenuation of S waves and a decrease of P wa ve v elocities between depths of about 100–250 km (62–155 mi) – is taken to define the asthenosphere. The viscosity of the asthenosphere is largely similar to that of the bulk of the underlying mantle, but it is far less than that of the lithosphere, enabling plate-tectonic motions to take place. At subduction zones the asthenosphere appears to penetrate down to approximately 700 km (430 mi), which is comparable with the transition zone between the upper and lower mantle. Other planets such as Venus and Mars are assumed to have asthenospheres, as are some of the larger satellites. The Moon is known to have an asthenosphere at a depth of approximately 1000 km (620 mi), and recent seismological evidence suggests that it may be even more fluid at a greater depth.

When astigmatism is present point objects such as stars usually appear elongated, either into a line or an ellipse. Attempts to reduce the elongated image to a point by refocusing will cause the orientation of the elongation to change through 90º. The best or least distorted result occurs as the orientation changes and the image becomes round; this is known as the circle of least confusion.

The chemical composition of most stars is dominated by hydrogen, with helium in second place and the remaining elements a long way behind. The relative proportions (or abundances) of the elements are quantified either by the number of atoms or the mass involved. In terms of mass, av erage material from outer layers of the Sun and the rest of the Solar System contain 70.7% hydrogen, 27.4% helium and 1.6% of all the other elements. These three quantities are called mass fractions and are conventionally labelled X , Y and Z . In terms of the number of atoms, hydrogen dominates even more, with 92.0% hydrogen, 7.8% helium, and all the rest just 0.12%. Elements other than hydrogen and helium are often termed the HEAVY ELEMENTS , and their relative abundances are shown in the accompanying table. These figures, which are representative compositions throughout the Universe, are changed by NUCLEOSYN - THESIS reactions inside stars. Thus at the centre of the Sun, the abundance of hydrogen has currently fallen to 38% by mass, and that of helium has increased to about 60%. Stars that have completed their MAIN - SEQUENCE lives, will have cores of almost pure helium. Solar mass stars will go on to synthesize carbon and oxygen, and higher mass stars will create the elements all the way to iron. The remaining elements are produced during SUPERNOVA explosions. Nucleosynthesis implies that hydrogen is continually being converted into heavier elements, and so abun- dances change slowly. But only a few per cent of helium by mass can have been produced this way during the life- time of the Universe. Most helium, therefore, was pro- duced during the early stages of the Universe ( see COSMOCHEMISTRY ). The remaining elements have been produced inside stars, and then ejected to mix with the interstellar medium through stellar winds, supernova explosions and so on. The mass fraction, Z , of the heavy elements is therefore increasing with time. The oldest stellar POPULATIONS , known as Population II stars, found in the galactic nucleus and halo and in globular clusters, have values of Z around 0.5%. Stars in the disk of the Galaxy are younger, have a higher proportion of heavy elements and are called Population I stars. Thus the Sun, which formed about 4.5 billion years ago, has Z = 1.6%, while stars forming today have Z ≈ 4%. Some stars are exceptions to the norms, the most important being the WHITE DWARFS . These stars, which are at the ends of their lives, have lost their outer layers and so have their cores exposed. The cores contain the products of nucleosynthesis, and thus the composition of white dwarfs ranges from helium-rich through relatively pure carbon to calcium. W OLF – RAYET stars subdivide into the WN stars, formed of helium and nitrogen, and the WC stars, within which helium, carbon and oxygen pre- dominate. TTA URI stars have an over-abundance of lithi- um. AP STARS are over-abundant in elements such as mercury, strontium, silicon, europium, holmium and chromium. It is thought that these latter peculiarities occur just in a thin surface layer and are perhaps brought about by diffusion. Beneath that thin layer the remaining parts of the star are of normal composition. CARBON STARS have over-abundances of lithium and carbon, while S-type stars additionally have over-abundances of zirconi- um and yttrium. Technetium has been detected in both carbon and S stars, and since all isotopes of technetium are radioactive with short half-lives, it must have been pro- duced inside the stars. Nucleosynthesis products are thus being brought to the surface in these stars. There are other anomalies to be found, and such stars are termed CHEMI - CALLY PECULIAR STARS (CP). In the outer layers of cooler stars, simple molecules such as CH, TiO, CN and C 2 may be observed, but stars are too hot for most molecules to form. Molecules are therefore to be found in cooler regions such as planets ( see GEOCHEMISTRY ) and GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUDS (GMCs). Some 120 molecule species have been identified so far in GMCs, including water (H 2 O), ammonia (NH 3 ), salt (NaCl) and ethanol (CH 3 CH 2 OH). Much of the material between the stars is molecular hydrogen (H 2 ). Astro E J apanese X-ray observation satellite that has not y et been scheduled for launch.

Traditionally, astrographs are refracting telescopes characterized by their OBJECTIVES , which have relatively fast FOCAL RATIOS (sometimes as fast as f /4) and fields of view up to 6º wide – large by astronomical standards. The objectives may have three or four component lenses to achieve this performance, and the biggest astrographs have lenses 50 cm (20 in.) or so in diameter. Astrographs are always placed on EQUATORIAL MOUNTINGS , which are motor-driven to allow the telescope to follow the apparent motion of the sky. The first recognizable astrograph was built in 1886 at the Paris Observatory. It had an aperture of 330 mm (13 in.) and its objective was designed to give the best images in blue light, early photographic emulsions being insensitive to other colours. The success of this telescope led, in 1887, to a major international conference of astronomers agreeing to embark on a photographic sur- vey of the whole sky – the CARTE DU CIEL . The Paris astro- graph was adopted as a standard model for this ambitious project, and several similar telescopes were built with focal lengths of 3.4 m (134 in.) and objectives corrected for colour and COMA , including one at Greenwich in 1890. Astrographic photographs were always taken on glass plates rather than film, which lacks the stability of glass. The instruments were principally used for ASTROMETRY , the accurate measurement of star positions, but have now been superseded by the SCHMIDT CAMERA . Astrographic Catalogue See CARTE DU CIEL astrolabe Early disk-shaped astronomical instrument, for measuring positions on the celestial sphere, equippped with sights for observing celestial objects. The classical form, known as the planispheric astrolabe , originated in ancient Greece, attained its greatest refinement in the hands of medieval Arab astronomers ( see ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY ) and reached the Christian West in about the 10th century AD . The basic form consists of two flat disks, one of which (the mater ) is fixed and represents the observer on the Earth. The other (the rete ) is movable and represents the celestial sphere. The altitudes and azimuths of celestial bodies can be read. A pointer or alidade can be used for measuring altitudes when the instrument is suspended by a string. Given the latitude, the date and the time, the observer can read off the altitude and azimuth of the Sun, the bright stars and the planets, and measure the altitude of a body and find the time. Its function of representing the night sky for a certain latitude at various times is reproduced in the modern PLANISPHERE . The astrolabe can be used as an analogue computer for many problems in spherical trigonometry, and it was used even for terrestrial surveying work such as determining the altitude of a tower. The mariner’s astrolabe is a simplified instrument designed for observing the altitudes of the Sun and stars while at sea, as an aid to navigation. It was developed by the Portuguese and was used mainly in the 17th century, being supplanted by the SEXTANT . The precision (or prismatic ) astrolabe is a 19th- century instrument for determining local time and latitude by accurately measuring when a star reaches a certain alti- tude. It was further developed as the impersonal astro- labe (so called because it eliminates the observer’s personal error) by André DANJON in 1938. astrology In its modern form, a pseudoscience that claims to be able to assess personality traits and predict future events from the positions of celestial objects, particularly the visible planets. Today, more newspaper space is devoted to horoscopes than to astronomy, and if anything the influence of astrology is probably increasing. Yet there is no scientific justification for the claims made by astrologers. Astrology has a long history and was of great impor- tance to primitive and superstitious peoples. The positions of the planets and the constellations at the time of a per- son’s birth were believed to have a great influence on their subsequent life and career. Unusual celestial events such as eclipses of the Sun and Moon, and the appearance of comets and ‘guest stars’, were significant in times when most people believed that the heavens could influence their fates, and there emerged a class of astrologers who made their living from the gulli- bility of their clients. Kings often employed astrologers whose job was to keep up the morale of their subjects by assuring them that the dates of particular events such as royal births were auspicious ones. The efforts of astrologers and priests to predict such apparently omi- nous events as eclipses helped to establish astronomy as a legitimate subject of study. astrometric binary BINARY STAR system in which one component is too faint to be observed directly. Its binary nature is detected by perturbations in the visible component’s PROPER MOTION , caused by the orbital motion of the unseen companion. Some astrometric binaries, just beyond the limit resolution, appear as a single elongated image, with the orientation of the long axis changing as a result of orbital rotation. astrometry Branch of astronomy concerned with the precise measurement of the apparent positions of celestial objects through the creation of a fundamental non- rotating reference frame on the CELESTIAL SPHERE . This frame is used not only for precisely recording the relative positions of celestial objects, but also for measurements of stellar PARALLAX and PROPER MOTION , and as a reference for relating optical observations to those in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The frame has the Sun at its centre and is based on the plane of the Earth’s equator (from which DECLINATION is measured) and the FIRST POINT OF ARIES (the zero point for measuring RIGHT ASCENSION ). The position of the equator and the First Point of Aries for a given date (called the EPOCH ) has traditionally been defined by making observations of the Sun and planets using a meridian or TRANSIT CIRCLE . This instrument is mounted on a fixed east–west horizontal axis and can only rotate in a north–south vertical plane. The declination of a celestial object is found from the inclination of the telescope when the object is observed crossing the MERIDIAN ; RIGHT ASCENSION is reckoned by timing the exact moment this occurs. Once the positions of the celestial equator and the First astrograph 34 A \u0001 astrolabe Astronomy was a vital aid to navigation for centuries, and astrolabes, like this medieval Islamic brass example, were important instruments.

Measuring stellar positions in this way provides fundamental observations of the celestial bodies since they are measured with respect to an inertial reference frame rather than to other ‘fixed’ stars. The initial, raw observations from the transit circle first need to be corrected for the Earth’s movement through space, that is, referred to the centre of the Sun (heliocentric coordinates), and also corrected for the individual motions of the stars themselves. The components of these motions across the line of sight are called proper motions and were first discovered in 1718 by Edmond HALLEY . The observations are first referred to the centre of the Earth by allowing for the effect of REFRACTION , diurnal parallax and diurnal ABERRATION . By making further corrections for PRECESSION , NUTATION and polar drift, the coordinates are then referred to the fundamental plane of the equator. Heliocentric coordinates are obtained by correcting for the orbital motion of the Earth by allowing for the effects of ANNUAL PARALLAX and aberration. It is then possible to go one step further and make a correction for the motion of the Sun itself, which appears ‘reflected’ in the proper motions of nearby stars. The ultimate accuracy of our measurement of stellar positions therefore depends on our knowledge of the astronomical constants of precession, aberration, nutation and the stellar proper motions. In the past, much of our knowledge of positions, parallaxes and proper motions was achieved through photographic astrometry, undertaken over many years using long-focus telescopes to obtain photographic plates of individual areas of the sky. The stellar images on these plates were then measured very accurately on dedicated measuring machines to determine their relative positions. Nowadays our knowledge comes from instruments such as the Carlsberg Meridian Telescope (CMT) at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the Canary Island of La Palma and the astrometric satellite HIPPARCOS . The Carlsberg Meridian Telescope is dedicated to carrying out high-precision optical astrometry and is currently being used to map the northern sky using a CCD detector. This will provide accurate positions of stars, allowing a reliable link to be made between the bright stars measured by the Hipparcos satellite and fainter stars seen on photographic plates. So far, the CMT has made measurements of some 180,000 positions, proper motions and magnitudes for stars down to magnitude 15, and over 25,000 positions and magnitudes of 180 Solar System objects, ranging from the outer planets including Pluto to some of the many asteroids that orbit the Sun between Earth and Mars. Hipparcos was the first space experiment designed specifically for astrometry. The satellite, which operated between 1989 and 1993, extended the range of accurate parallax distances by roughly l0 times, at the same time increasing the number of stars with good parallaxes by a much greater factor. Of the 118,218 stars in the Hipparcos catalogue, the distances of 22,396 are now known to better than 10% accuracy. Prior to Hipparcos, this number was less than 1000. The companion Tycho database, from another instrument on the satellite, provides lower accuracy for 1,058,332 stars. This includes nearly all stars to magnitude 10.0 and many to 11.0. Information on star positions, parallaxes and proper motion is published in FUNDAMENTAL CATALOGUES and between 1750 and 1762 James BRADLEY compiled a catalogue that was to form the basis of the first fundamental one ever made, by Friedrich BESSEL , in 1830. By comparing Bradley’s work with that of Giuseppe PIAZZI in Palermo in about 1800, Bessel was able to calculate values of proper motions for certain bright stars and also to derive the constants of precession for the epochs involved. Bessel’s name is also inextricably linked with two other aspects of astrometry. He was the first, in 1838, to measure the TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX of a star and derived a distance of 9.3 l.y. (the modern v alue is 11.3 l.y.) for the nearby binary star SIXTY - ONE CYGNI . From his work on the fundamental catalogue he also found that the proper motion of SIRIUS w as not constant and he correctly attributed this ‘wobble’ to the presence of an unseen companion pulling Sirius from its path. The companion was discovered in 1862, making Sirius the first example of an ASTROMETRIC BINARY . Further fundamental catalogues followed with those of Simon NEWCOMB (1872, 1898) and Arthur AUW ERS (1879) being especially important. The latter was the first in the Fundamental Katalog series compiled in Germany, the latest of which is the FK5 Part II . This catalogue provides mean positions and proper motions at equinox and epoch J2000.0 for 3117 new FUNDAMENTAL STARS . The European Space Agency also has plans for a next- generation astrometric satellite, called GAIA. Instead of orbiting the Earth, GAIA will be operated at the L 1 Sun–Earth Lagrangian point, located 1.5 million km (0.9 million mi) from Earth in the direction away from the Sun. Here it will have a stable thermal environment and will be free from eclipses and occultations by the Earth. The purpose of the satellite will be repeatedly to measure positions of more than a billion stars to an accuracy of a few microarcseconds, the goal being to achieve 10- microarcsecond precision for stars as faint as 15th magnitude, with potentially four or five microarcseconds achievable for stars brighter than 10th magnitude. This will be more than a hundred times more accurate than the observations from Hipparcos. astronautics Science of space flight.

Its best current value is 149,597,870.66 km. The determination of the astronomical unit was one of the most important problems of astronomy until com- paratively recent times. From the ancient Greeks up to the early 18th century, the Earth–Sun distance was known very imperfectly because it depended on very fine angular measurements that were beyond the capabilities of the available instruments. Johannes Kepler’s best esti- mate, for example, was only one-tenth of the actual v alue. In the 18th and 19th centuries attempts to mea- sure the AU were made by making accurate observations of Mars or Venus from two widely separated places on the Earth’s surface, and calculating the planet’s distance by triangulation. Kepler’s third law was then used to compute the Sun–Earth distance. The first such attempt w as made by Giovanni Domenico CASSINI , who got within 7% of the true value. Some improvement was achieved by measuring the distances of asteroids, espe- cially close-approaching ones, such as 433 Eros. Such refinements were achieved in the late 19th century by David GILL and by Harold Spencer JONES in the 20th. The current technique makes use of radar measure- ments, and the probable error has been reduced by sev- eral orders of magnitude compared to the best visible-light values. astronomy, history of Astronomy is the oldest of the sciences and predates the written word. ARCHAEOASTRONOMY has shown that early peoples made use of astronomical observations in the alignment of their megalithic monuments. Written records of astronomical observations in Egypt, Babylon and China ( see EGYPTIAN ASTRONOMY ; BABYLON - IAN ASTRONOMY ; CHINESE ASTRONOMY ) and Greece date from pre-Christian times and it is to the Greeks that we owe the beginnings of scientific theorizing and systematic efforts to understand the Universe. The main legacy of Greek astronomy was a system of thought dominated by the work of ARISTOTLE , though many other Greek scientists of great originality contributed to early astronomical knowledge. Greek ideas survived the medieval period, largely through the ALMAGEST of Ptolemy, a Graeco-Roman com- pendium of astronomical knowledge preserved by schol- ars in the Islamic world and the Byzantine Empire ( see MEDIEVAL EUROPEAN ASTRONOMY ; ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY ). ‘Modern’ astronomy can be said to have begun with the rejection by Nicholas COPERNICUS of Aristotle’s com- plex picture of planetary orbits, which assumed that the Sun was the centre of the Universe. Although Copernicus put forward a simpler and more logical view, which placed the planets at distances from the Sun that increased with their periods, its details were very complex and unconvincing to many of his contemporaries ( see COPERNICAN SYSTEM ). Only after the meticulous obser- va tions of Tycho BRAHE and their interpretation by J ohannes KEPLER did the new ideas begin to gain general acceptance ( see RENAISSANCE ASTRONOMY ). The invention of the telescope and its exploitation by GALILEO began an era of astronomical discovery that com- pletely destroyed the picture formulated by the ancients. Building on the mathematical and physical discoveries of the 17th century, Isaac NEWTON produced a synthesis of ideas which explained earthly mechanics and planetary motions, based on his three laws of motion and his inverse-square law of gravitational attraction. The last few centuries show an ever-increasing number of astronomical discoveries. As early as the 17th century, Ole RÖMER showed that the speed of light is finite. Investi- gations of the heavens beyond the Milky Way began in the 1700s and are principally associated with William HER - SCHEL . He also began the trend towards building tele- scopes of greater and greater power, with which the Universe could be explored to ever-increasing distances. The 19th century saw the development of astrophysics as the centre of astronomical interest: astronomers became interested in the physics of celestial phenomena and the nature of celestial bodies, rather than just describ- ing their positions and motions. The development of stel- lar SPECTROSCOPY and its use by William HUGGINS and others led the way to understanding the nature of the many nebulous objects in the sky. ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY emerged as a sensitive and reliable technique that allowed sky maps to be prepared in an objective and repeatable wa y. Sky SURVEYS began to be made that showed up spiral nebulae and variable phenomena that had been beyond the reach of purely visual techniques. At the start of the 20th century were two astounding discoveries that revolutionized physics and astronomy: Astronomical Data Center 36 A A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:06 pm Page 36"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"astrophotography Max PLANCK ’s realization that energy is quantized (1901), and Albert EINSTEIN ’ S theory of special relativity (1905). They were the heralds of what was to come. Observation- al astronomy has grown exponentially ever since. The g iant telescopes in excellent climates promoted by George Ellery HALE soon led to the discovery by Edwin HUBBLE that the spiral nebulae are external galaxies and that the Universe is expanding. The morphology of our own Galaxy began to be understood. The great outburst of technological development asso- ciated with World War II led to the development of sensi- tive radio and infrared detectors that allowed the Universe to be investigated at wavelengths where new phenomena such as pulsars and quasars were discovered. In the late 1950s space probes had been developed that could take X-ray and gamma-ray detectors above the Earth’s atmos- phere and open yet further vistas to astrophysics. Even visible-light observations have been improved by the development of CCD detectors many times more sensi- tive than photographic plates. The early 21st century is characterized by a new gener- a tion of giant telescopes and a vigorous investigation of conditions near the time when the Universe was formed. Massive data-handling techniques are allowing surveys of unprecedented detail to be made, searching for new phe- nomena hitherto unobserved or unobservable because of their faintness or rarity. See also AMATEUR ASTRONOMY , HISTORY OF ; INFINITE UNIVERSE , IDEA OF astrophotography Recording images of celestial objects on traditional photographic emulsion (film), as opposed to electronic means. From the late 19th century until the last two decades of the 20th, almost all professional astronomical observations were made using photography. From its introduction in 1839, it was 50 years before photography became accepted as a legitimate research tool by professional astronomers, and another quarter of a century before improvements to equipment and plates had made it vital to the progress of astronomical research. What the human eye cannot see in a fraction of a sec- ond it will never see, whereas with both photography and electronic imaging light is accumulated over a period of time, revealing objects that are invisible even through the largest telescope, and creating a permanent record that is not affected by the observer’s imagination or accuracy. However, early astrophotography suffered from insuffi- ciently accurate TELESCOPE DRIVES , lack of sensitivity (‘speed’) in film, and film’s inability to record light equally w ell across the whole visible spectrum – for many years it w as ‘blind’ to red. Despite these drawbacks, the new technology was put to immediate use, mainly by enthusiastic amateurs. In this first form of practicable photography, a silvered cop- per plate sensitized with iodine vapour was exposed, developed with mercury vapour and fixed with sodium h yposulphite to produce a Daguerrotype, named after Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre (1789–1851), who per- fected the process. The Moon was an obvious (because bright) target, and the first successful Daguerreotype of it is attributed to John DRAPER (1840 March); the expo- sure time was 20 minutes, and the image showed only the most basic detail. Hippolyte FIZEAU and Léon FOU - CAULT obtained a successful Daguerreotype of the Sun in 1845 April. In 1850 W.C. BOND obtained excellent images of the Moon and the first star images, of Vega and Castor. With the replacement of Daguerrotypes by the faster and more practical wet plate collodion technique in the early 1850s came a more systematic approach to astrophotography. John HERSCHEL proposed using pho- tography on a daily basis to record sunspot activity, and this ‘solar patrol’ was taken up and directed by Warren DE LA RUE . This trail-blazing work, which continued until 1872, was continued and developed by Walter MAUNDER and Jules JANSSEN . De La Rue subsequently obtained excellent images of the 1860 July 18 total solar eclipse, which proved that the prominences were solar and not lunar phenomena. In the United States, G.P. BOND pursued stellar photography with improved equip- ment and considerable success. An improvement came in the 1870s with the intro- duction of the more convenient dry photographic plates, and talented individuals such as Lewis RU THERFORD and Henry DRAPER in the United States, and subsequently Andrew COMMON and Isaac Roberts (1829–1904) in Britain, pushed forward the frontiers of astrophotogra- phy. In 1880 Draper succeeded in taking a photograph of the Orion Nebula (M42), and a few years later Com- mon and Roberts obtained excellent photographs of M42. There were also significant advances in photo- g raphic spectroscopy, by Draper, William HUGGINS , E.C. PICKERING and others. The 1880s marked photography’s breakthrough in astronomy. In 1882 David GILL obtained the first com- pletely successful image of a comet. He was impressed by the huge numbers of stars on the images, accumulated in exposures lasting up to 100 minutes. With Jacobus KAPTEYN , he set out to construct a photographic star map of the southern sky; the resulting catalogue contained the magnitudes and positions of over 450,000 stars. Equally enthusiastic were the HENRY brothers at Paris Observato- ry , who helped to instigate the international project to pre- pare a major photographic sky chart that became known as the CARTE DU CIEL . With the new century came a desire to discern the true nature of astronomical bodies by photographing their spectra. Increasing telescope apertures enabled g reater detail to be resolved in the spiral nebulae by, for example, James KEELER and George RITCHEY . Edwin HUBBLE and others, using the 100-inch (2.5-m) Hooker T elescope at Mount Wilson Observatory, showed these objects to be other galaxies far beyond the Milky Way, and spectroscopy showed them to be receding from Earth, in an expanding Universe. As the 20th century progressed, photographic materi- als became increasingly sensitive and pushed the bound- aries of the known Universe ever outward. But by the end of the century the technique that had contributed so much to astronomy had been dropped far more rapidly than it w as ever accepted, in favour of electronic imaging using CCD s. Although astrophotography was well established and initially cheaper, their greater light sensitivity, linear response to light and digital output saw CCDs rapidly sw eep the board. As CCDs have become larger and cheaper, electronic imaging has almost completely replaced astrophotography Astrophotography at major observatories may be a thing of the past, but many amateur astronomers still use conventional film, despite the availability of CCDs and digital cameras, partly because of its simplicity but also because it continues to yield results of superlative quality at low cost. Some advanced amateurs use film for the exposures themselves, but then scan the images for manipulation on a computer, borrowing one of the main advantages of digital photography. F or astrophotography and CCD imaging alike, the telescope or camera must be driven so as to follow objects as they are carried across the sky by the Earth’s rotation. The long exposure times required by photo- g raphic film, often over an hour, necessitate a means of monitoring the accuracy of tracking and making correc- tions to the drive rate: either a separate GUIDE TELESCOPE or an OFF - AXIS GUIDING system. In simple systems the astrophotographer looks through an eyepiece equipped with cross-wires and adjusts the drive rate manually, while more advanced systems use an AU T OGUIDER , which makes automatic corrections if the chosen guide star starts to drift out of the field of view. Autoguiders on amateur instruments incorporate a CCD whose purpose is to monitor the guide star – the imaging task may be left to the superior data acquisition of photography. Virtually every type of film has its use in amateur astrophotography. An important characteristic of film is its graininess: the surface is covered with minute light-sen- 37 A A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:06 pm Page 37"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"sitive grains, which are visible under high magnification after exposure. Fine-grained films provide excellent sharpness and contrast, but are relatively insensitive to light. More sensitive films can record images with shorter exposure times, or fainter objects in a given exposure time, but have the disadvantage of coarse grain. Negative films generally record a wider range of brightness than transparency films, but require more effort afterwards to get a satisfactory print. This drawback is now largely over- come with the ready availability of film scanners, comput- er manipulation and high-quality colour printers. HYPERSENSITIZATION is an advanced technique to increase the sensitivity and speed of film for long exposures. As CCDs become cheaper and capable of recording images of ever higher resolution, even amateur astropho- tography is declining in importance. It is rare to find advanced amateurs using film for planetary imaging or for supernova patrolling, for example. It remains ideal for aurora and total eclipse photography, and for general con- stellation shots. Many deep-sky photographs, particularly of wide fields, remain firmly in the province of film. It is not hard to foresee the day when even ordinary film is hard to find, but until then, photography will still have a place in amateur astronomy. Astrophysical Journal F oremost research journal for theoretical and observational developments in astronomy and astrophysics. Dating from 1895, when it was launched by George Ellery HALE and James KEELER , the ‘ ApJ ’ reported many of the classic discoveries of the 20th century. In 1953 The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series w as introduced to allow the publication of extensive astronomical data papers in support of the main journal. astrophysics Branch of astronomy that uses the laws of physics to understand astronomical objects and the processes occurring within them. The terms ‘astronomy’ and ‘astrophysics’ are however often used as synonyms. Astrophysics effectively dates from the first applications of the SPECTROSCOPE to study astronomical objects. Sir William HUGGINS ’ identification of some of the chemical elements present in the Sun and stars in the 1860s was the first major result of astrophysics. Today, the use of computers for data processing, analysis and for modelling objects and processes is an integral part of almost all aspects of astrophysics. SPECTROSCOPY is the most powerful technique available in astrophysics. Individual atoms, ions or molecules emit or absorb light at characteristic frequencies (or ‘lines’, from their appearance in a spectroscope) and can thus be identified and their quantity assessed. Information on the physical and chemical state of an object can be obtained from an analysis of the way its SPECTRUM is modified by the collective environmental conditions within the object. Line-of-sight velocities of the whole object or regions within it are indicated by the DOPPLER SHIFT . The most intensively studied spectral region is the ground-accessible ‘optical’ region (the NEAR - ULTRAVIOLET to the NEAR - INFRARED ), but much information now comes from observations in the RADIO , MICROWAVE , FAR - ULTRAVIOLET , X - RAY and GAMMA - RAY regions. Stellar spectra characteristically show a continuous bright background that by its colour distribution approxi- mately indicates the ‘surface’ temperature (but is made up of radiation contributed in some measure from through- out the whole of the stellar atmosphere). Several different processes produce these continua. In cooler stars (like the Sun) the interaction chiefly involves electrons and hydro- gen atoms; in hotter stars, electrons and protons; and in the hottest stars, electrons alone. The dark spectral lines superimposed on the continuum, which are due to atoms, ions and molecules, strictly do not arise from absorption by a cooler outer layer as a simple visualization suggests, b ut in a complex depth-dependent manner in which radi- a tion dominantly escapes from outer and therefore cooler (darker) regions of the atmosphere near the centre of an absorption line, or deeper, hotter (brighter) regions for the continuum. The fact that the lines appear dark indi- cates that the outer layers are cooler, and indeed the tem- perature generally is expected to decrease outwards from the centre of any star. For the Sun and certain other stars some bright lines are also seen, particularly in the far- ultraviolet region, indicating that in these the temperature is rising again in extended, extremely tenuous layers of the outer atmosphere. The strengths, widths and polarization of spectral lines give information on the chemical compo- sition, ionization state, temperature structure, density structure, surface gravity, magnetic field strength, amount of turbulent motion within the atmosphere of the star and stellar rotation. A striking result of astronomical spectroscopy is the uniformity of chemical composition throughout the Uni- ver se ( see ASTROCHEMISTRY ), extending even to the most distant galaxies. Although the atomic constituents of the Universe are everywhere the same, the proportions of these elements are not identical in all astronomical objects. Measurements of these differences give information on the nuclear processes responsible for the formation of the elements and the evolutionary processes at work. A star is kept in a steady state for a long time by the balance of the inward pull of gravity and the opposing force arising from the increase of pressure with depth that is maintained by a ve ry high central temperature. For a star like the Sun (mass of 2 \u0001 10 30 kg, radius 700,000 km/435,000 mi) the central temperature is about 15,600,000 K. The energy from such hot matter works its way tortuously outwards through the star until it is radiated away from the atmos- pheric region near its surface. This process yields a rela- tionship between the masses and luminosities of stars, with the luminosity increasing very dramatically with mass. Thus the luminosities of stars within the relatively small range of masses between 0.1 and 10 times that of the Sun differ by a factor of over a million. The high rate of loss of energy requires a powerful energy-producing process within the star, identified as thermonuclear fusion of light atomic nuclei (mainly hydrogen nuclei) into heav- ier ones (mainly helium nuclei). The transformation of h ydrogen into helium in the case of the Sun – a small star – makes enough energy available to enable it to shine as it does today for a total of about 10 10 y ears. In contrast, the lifetime of massive, very luminous stars, which burn up their hydrogen very rapidly, can be as short as a million y ears. During this burning process the core contracts, and it eventually becomes hot and dense enough for helium itself to ignite and to form carbon and oxygen. Although the contraction of the core is thus halted, the star then has a rather complicated structure, with two nuclear burning zones, and may become unstable. Later stages in the evo- lutionary cycle present many possibilities depending prin- cipally on the initial mass of the star. It may become a WHITE DWARF , such as the companion of Sirius, which is a ve ry dense, hot star with about the mass of the Sun but a radius nearer that of the Earth. The immense pressures b uilt up in such stars result in the matter forming them becoming DEGENERATE . More massive stars than the Sun progress to advanced stages of NUCLEOSYNTHESIS , experiencing ignition of suc- cessively heavier nuclei at their cores. In some rare cases much of the outer layers of the star may be violently eject- ed in a SUPERNOVA outburst in which heavy elements (some synthesized in the explosion) are scattered widely into the general interstellar medium. Out of this enriched material later generations of stars are formed. The residues of these events may be NEUTRON STARS , which can be observed as PULSARS , and represent a still higher state of compression than white dwarfs, with electrons and protons crushed together to form a degenerate neutron gas. On the other hand, a star may go on contracting until it becomes a BLACK HOLE , whose violent accretion of near- by material makes its influence observable by strong emis- sion in the X-ray region. A great deal of theoretical work has gone into explain- ing how the distribution of radiation over the spectrum of a star depends on the structure of its outermost layers, Astrophysical Journal 38 A A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:06 pm Page 38"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"atlas, star and, more broadly, the processes occurring during the life c ycles of stars. The latter includes the stars’ formation from collapsed regions of the interstellar medium, their active burning phases, and their deaths, which can range from being an event in which a star mildly fades away to being a violent explosion that at its maximum brightness can appear as brilliant as a whole galaxy. Such applications of physics to astronomical problems in general are progressing strongly on most fronts and much success has been achieved. Currently a great deal of a ttention is being directed towards the processes that occurred during the earliest phases of the formation of the Universe, very close to the time of the Big Bang. But here astronomers and physicists are venturing out hand in hand, for not only is our knowledge of the behaviour of the Universe incomplete, but so too is our knowledge of physics itself. New physical theories unifying all forces of nature are needed before we can begin to understand the most fundamental properties of the evolving Universe and, indeed, the origin of matter itself. Asuka J apan’s fourth cosmic X-ray astronomy satellite. It is called the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA), also known as Astro D. It was launched in 1993 February, equipped with four large- area telescopes. ASCA was the first X-ray astronomy mission to combine imaging capability with a broad- wa v elength bandwidth, good spectral resolution and large-area coverage, as well as the first to carry charge- coupled devices (CCDs) for X - RAY ASTRONOMY . Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) Millimetre-wavelength telescope planned by a major international consortium that includes the NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY (USA), the PART ICLE PHYSICS AND ASTRONOMY RESEARCH COUNCIL (UK) and the EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY , planned for completion in 2010. The instrument, at an elevation of 5000 m (16,400 ft) at Llano de Chajnantor in the Chilean Andes, will consist of at least 64 antennae 12 m (39 ft) in diameter, allowing resolution to a scale of 0 \u0001 .01. The high altitude will give ALMA access to wavebands between 350 \u0002 m and 10 mm, otherwise accessible only from space. ataxite See IRON METEORITE ATC Abbreviation of ASTRONOMICAL TECHNOLOGY CENTRE Aten asteroid Any member of a class of asteroids that, like the APOLLO ASTEROIDS , cross the orbit of the Earth, b ut that are distinguished by having orbital periods of less than one year.

It began its career as the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missile in 1957. The Atlas was equipped with a Centaur upper stage in 1962 and, since that failed maiden flight, has operated in a number of Atlas Centaur configurations, making over 100 flights. This configuration later became known as the Atlas 2, 2A and 2AS, which by 2001 had together made almost 50 flights. The new Atlas 3, which first flew in 1999, and the Atlas 5 fleets (there is no Atlas 4) will use a Russian first-stage engine. The Atlas 2 fleets will be retired in 2002, leaving the Atlas 3 and 5 offering launches to geostationary transfer orbit within the 4- to 8.6-tonne range. The Atlas 5 has been built primarily as a US Air F orce launcher, under the Evolved Expendable Launch V ehicle programme. atlas, star Collection of charts on which are plotted the positions of stars and, usually, numbers of deep-sky objects, over the whole of the sky or between certain limits of declination, down to a certain LIMITING MAGNITUDE . The classic star atlases of the 17th and 18th centuries in particular are now appreciated for their beauty. The 19th century saw a division appear between atlases produced for professional and for amateur astronomers, and the emergence of the photographic atlases.

Until the 17th century, accuracy of position in atlases wa s often the victim of artistic licence, stars being placed where they looked best on intricately drawn constellation figures. The first truly modern atlas was Johann BAYER ’s Uranometria of 1603, which plotted accurate positions from Tycho BRAHE ’s star catalogue, distinguished between different magnitudes, and introduced the practice of labelling stars with Greek letters ( see BAYER LETTERS ); the allegorical constellation figures were depicted faintly to the stars. Other notable atlases, based on observations by their originators, were those of Johannes HEVELIUS and John FLAMSTEED . The last great general all-sky ‘artistic’ star a tlas was Johann BODE ’s Uranographia (1801), which showed over 17,000 stars and nebulae on huge pages with beautifully engraved constellation figures. The 19th and 20th centuries saw the introduction of photographic atlases for the professional, such as the CARTE DU CIEL and the P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY SKY SUR - VEY , and the appearance of atlases for amateur observers. The most venerable is perhaps Norton’s Star Atlas , by Arthur Philip Norton (1876–1955), first pub- lished in 1919 and with its 20th edition planned for 2002. The lavish two-volume Millennium Star Atlas (R.W. Sinnott and M. Perryman, 1997), showing stars to magnitude 11, may be the last such large printed star a tlas for the amateur observer, now that virtual atlases are readily available ( see SOFTWARE ). atmosphere Gaseous envelope that surrounds a planet, satellite or star. The characteristics of a body that determine its ability to maintain an atmosphere are the temperature of the outer layers and the ESCAPE VELOCITY , which is dependent on the body’s mass. Small bodies, such as the Moon, Mercury and the satellites of the planets in our Solar System (apart from TITAN and TRITON ), do not have any appreciable permanent atmosphere. The escape velocity for these bodies is sufficiently low for it to be easily exceeded by gas molecules travelling with the appropriate thermal speeds for their masses and temperature. The speed of a gas molecule increases with temperature and decreases with the molecular weight. Consequently, the lighter molecules, such as hydrogen, helium, methane and ammonia, escape more readily to space than the heavier species, such as nitrogen, oxygen and carbon dioxide. MERCURY has a transient, tenuous atmosphere, consisting of material that it captures from the SOLAR WIND , which it retains for a short period. In the cold outer reaches of the Solar System, PLUTO and Triton have potential atmospheric gases frozen out on their surfaces. When Pluto is close to perihelion (as in the late 20th century), the gases sublime to produce a tenuous a tmosphere of methane and ammonia. It is estimated that these gases will refreeze on to the surface by about the year 2020. The primary atmospheres of the bodies in the Solar System originated from the gaseous material in the SOLAR NEBULA . The lighter gases were lost from many of these objects, particularly the terrestrial planets VENUS , EARTH and MARS , which now have secondary atmos- pheres formed from internal processes such as volcanic eruptions. The main constituent of the atmospheres of V enus and Mars is carbon dioxide (CO 2 ); the main con- stituents of the Earth’s atmosphere are nitrogen and oxy- gen (approximately 78% and 21% by volume, respectively). Free oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere is uniquely abundant and is believed to have accumulated as a result of photosynthesis in algae and plants. Earth’s is thus regarded by some authorities as a tertiary atmos- phere. The only other significant nitrogen atmosphere found in the Solar System is on Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, although nitrogen gas produces the active geyser-like plumes observed on Triton. Only the giant outer planets, JUPITER , SATURN , URANUS and NEPTUNE , still retain their primordial atmospheres of mainly hydro- gen and helium. However, these major planets are also surrounded by envelopes of escaped hydrogen. Titan, too, is associated with a torus of neutral hydrogen atoms, which have escaped from the satellite’s upper atmos- phere and populate the satellite’s orbit. It is also possible for a body to gain a temporary atmosphere through a collision with an object containing frozen gases, such as a cometary nucleus. The gaseous layers of an atmosphere are divided into a series of regions organized on the basis of the variation of temperature with altitude. For worlds with definite solid surfaces, such as the Earth, Venus, Mars and Titan, the levels start from the ground and relate to existing obser- va tions. The outer planets are huge gaseous bodies with no observable solid surface, and with atmospheres that have been investigated to just beneath the cloud tops. Consequently, the characteristics of the lowest layers are based upon theoretical models and the levels usually start from a reference level at which the pressure is 1 bar. The names given to the various structured layers of the terres- trial atmosphere are also applied to all other planetary a tmospheres. The precise variation of the atmospheric temperature with altitude depends on the composition of the atmosphere and the subsequent solar (and internal) heating and long-wave cooling at the various levels. The lowest layer is the TROPOSPHERE , which on the Earth extends from sea level, where the average pressure is 1 bar, to the TROPOPAUSE ,a t an altitude of between 5–8 km (3–5 mi) at the poles and 14–18 km (9–11 mi) at the equator. This region contains three-quarters of the mass of the atmosphere; it is the meteorological layer, containing the cloud and weather systems. The tropos- phere is heated from the ground and the temperature decreases with height to the tropopause, where the tem- perature reaches a minimum of approximately 218 K at the poles and 193 K over the equator. Above the tropopause, the temperature increases with height through the STRATOSPHERE because the heating from ozone (0 3 ) absorption dominates the long-wave cooling by CO 2 . The temperature increases to about 273 K at an altitude of 50 km (31 mi), which marks the stratopause. In the Earth’s atmosphere, the region between 15 and 50 km (9 and 31 mi), where the ozone is situated, is often called the ozonosphere. Beyond the stratopause the temperature again decreases with altitude through the MESOSPHERE to the atmospheric minimum of 110–173 K at the mesopause, which lies at an altitude of 86 or 100 km (53 or 62 mi) at different seasons. The atmos- phere at these levels is very tenuous and is therefore sen- sitive to the heating from the Sun. Consequently, this region and the further layers of the atmosphere have a significant diurnal temperature cycle. Beyond the mesopause, we enter the THERMOSPHERE , where the tem- perature increases with height until it meets interplane- tary space. The heating that produces this layered structure is primarily created by the absorption of far- ultraviolet solar radiation by oxygen and nitrogen in the a tmosphere. Solar X-rays also penetrate through to the mesosphere and the upper atmospheric layers, which are therefore sensitive to changes in the solar radiation and a tmospheric chemistry. The solar ultraviolet radiation photo-ionizes the atmospheric constituents in these outer layers to produce ionized atoms and molecules; this results in the formation of the IONOSPHERE at an alti- tude of about 60–500 km (40–310 mi). This region is also the domain of METEORS and AU R ORAE , which regu- larly occur in the upper atmosphere. Above 200–700 km (120–430 mi) is the EXOSPHERE , from which the atmos- pheric molecules escape into space. The individual planetary atmospheres each possess some or all of these basic structures but with specific va ri a tions as a consequence of their size, distance from the Sun, and atmospheric chemistry. The massive CO 2 a tmosphere of Venus has a deep troposphere, which extends from the surface to an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi). About 90% of the volume of the atmosphere is contained in the region between the surface and 28 km atmosphere 40 A \u0001 atmosphere The Earth’s atmosphere consists of the troposphere, extending from ground level to a height of between 8 and 17 km (5–10 mi); the stratosphere extends up to about 50 km (30 mi); the mesosphere, between 50 and about 80 km (50 mi); the thermosphere from about 80 up to 200 km (125 mi); beyond this lies the exosphere. 600 km Hubble Space T elescope pressure 10 –35 mb 350 km 300 km 250 km 200 km 150 km 100 km 50 km Concorde 10 km 400 km exosphere thermosphere mesosphere stratosphere troposphere Space Shuttle aurorae meteor trails 10 –22 mb 10 –16 mb 10 –10 mb 10 –3 mb 10 3 mb ozone layer International Space Station Mount Everest 8850m A AST ENCY PHI fin 9/4/02 5:06 pm Page 40"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"atom (17 mi). Venus has no stratosphere or mesosphere but does have a thermosphere. Its planetary atmosphere is, therefore, quite different from that of the Earth. By terrestrial standards, the Martian atmosphere is ve ry thin, since the surface pressure is only 6.2 millibars. The atmosphere does have some similarity in the vertical layering, however, with the presence of a troposphere, stratosphere and thermosphere. During the global dust storms, the structure of the Martian troposphere may change dramatically to an isothermal layer (that is, one with a constant temperature throughout) or may even display an inversion. However, there is much less ozone in the Martian atmosphere than in that of Earth, so there is no reversal in the temperature gradient as there is in the terrestrial stratosphere. Lower temperatures are found in the Martian thermosphere as a consequence of the CO 2 cooling effect. The basic structure of the atmospheres of the outer planets resembles that of the Earth. There is a tropos- phere, which extends to unknown depths beneath the clouds, and a well-defined stratosphere, created by the heating due to absorption of solar radiation by methane (CH 4 ). Knowledge of the higher levels of the atmospheres is still incomplete. Titan has a well-defined atmospheric structure, comprising a troposphere, stratosphere and thermosphere, created more by the complex aerosol chemistry than by gaseous composition alone. These atmospheric structures vary on a local scale as a consequence of the planetary weather systems. The atmos- phere of the Earth receives its energy from the Sun. The a tmosphere (including clouds) reflects 37% of the incident radiation back to space and absorbs the remainder, which becomes redistributed so that 48% of the incident radiation actually reaches the Earth’s surface, which then reflects 5% of the total directly back to space. The surface reradiates most of its absorbed energy back into the atmosphere as long-wave radiation, with a small amount (8%) passing directly to space. The heated atmosphere reradiates some of the long-wave radiation to the surface while a portion (50%) is ultimately lost to space. The atmosphere behaves like a giant heat engine, trying to balance the absorbed solar energy with the long-wave radiation emitted to space: the small imbalances that are always present give rise to the we a ther, and any longer-term variations produce changes in climate. In the Earth’s atmosphere, clouds, which cover approximately 50% of the surface, are a key factor in we a ther and climate because a small change in their geo- g raphical and vertical distribution will have a profound effect on the environment. Exploration of the Solar System has now provided a unique opportunity to examine the weather systems of all the planetary atmospheres. They have very different properties: Venus’ atmosphere is slowly rotating and total- ly covered with cloud; Mars’ thin atmosphere is strongly affected by the local topography and annual global dust storms; and the outer planets Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune have huge, rapidly rotating gaseous envelopes and meteo- rologies that are largely driven by the planets’ internal sources of energy. These planetary atmospheres of the Solar System are natural laboratories for investigating geo- physical fluid dynamics. atmospheric extinction Reduction in the brightness of light from astronomical objects when it passes through the Earth’s atmosphere. The atmosphere a ttenuates the light from these objects so that they appear fainter when seen from the surface than they w ould outside the atmosphere. This is caused by absorption and scattering by gas molecules, dust and wa ter vapour in the atmosphere. The amount of extinction is variable and can be determined by measuring the brightness of standard stars photometrically. Atmospheric extinction is most pronounced close to the horizon, where astronomical bodies are observed through a greater volume of air. atmospheric pressure F orce exerted by the gas forming an atmosphere on a unit area. The units are pascals (Pa), with 1 Pa = 1 N/m 2 . Commonly encountered non-SI units are the bar or millibar (1 bar = 10 5 P a) and the atmosphere (1 Atm = 101,325 Pa). Sea-level pressure on the Earth is around 10 5 Pa, surface pressures on Venus and Mars are 9.2 \u0001 10 6 Pa and 620 Pa respectively. Atmospheric pressure represents the weight of a vertical column of the a tmosphere whose cross-section is 1 m 2 . atmospheric refraction Small increase in the apparent altitude of a celestial object, as viewed by an observer on the surface of the Earth, caused by light from the object changing direction as it passes through the Earth’s at mosphere. When light passes from one medium to another it is bent, or refracted, and the same is true when light from a star passes from the vacuum of space into the Earth’s atmosphere. The result is to make the object appear at a higher altitude than is really the case, and the nearer it is to the horizon, the more pronounced the effect, even causing objects below the horizon to appear visible. The degree by which the light is refracted is also dependent on atmospheric pressure and temperature. All astronomical observations have to be corrected for atmospheric refraction to obtain true, as opposed to apparent, positions. A TNF Abbreviation of A USTRALIA TELESCOPE NATIONAL FA CILITY atom Smallest part of an ELEMENT . Atoms have a NUCLEUS containing PROTONS and NEUTRONS , together with a surrounding cloud of ELECTRONS ( see AT OMIC STRUCTURE ). The nucleus is positively charged, and contains almost all the mass of the atom. The mass of the a tom is called the atomic mass, symbol A , and is given approximately in AT OMIC MASS UNITS by the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the atomic number, symbol Z , and it determines the element to which the a tom belongs. In the normal atom there are equal numbers of protons and electrons, so that the atom as a whole is electrically neutral. If an atom loses or gains one or more electrons it becomes an ION . The number of neutrons in the nucleus may vary and results in the different ISOTOPES of the element. There are a number of variations in the nomenclature for atoms. Amongst the commonest are the chemical symbol plus atomic number and mass as superscripts and subscripts, for example: Fe 26 55.847 , 26 Fe 55.847 or 26 Fe 55.847 . Here, the atomic mass is the average for the element as it is found on Earth with the isotopes in their natural abundances. When an individual isotope is sym- bolized, the atomic mass will be much closer to a whole number.

The nucleus has a density of about 2.3 \u0001 10 17 kg/m 3 and is a few times 10 \u0002 15 m across. The atom as a whole has a size a few times 10 \u0002 11 m (note that neither the size of the nucleus nor of the atom can be precisely defined). Although there is structure inside the nucleus, the term ‘atomic structure’ is usually taken to mean that of the electrons. Quantum mechanics assigns a probability of existence to each electron at various points around the nucleus, resulting in electron orbitals. While the quantum mechan- ical description may be needed to describe some aspects of the behaviour of atoms, the conceptually simpler Bohr–Sommerfeld model is adequate for many purposes. This model was proposed in 1913 by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1885–1962). It treats the subatomic particles as though they are tiny billiard balls and the electrons move in circular orbits around the central nucleus. Differ- ent orbits correspond to different energies for the elec- trons, and only certain orbits and hence electron energies are permitted (that is, the orbits are quantized). Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1951, born in East Prussia at Königs- berg, now Kaliningrad) modified the theory in 1916 by adding elliptical orbits. When an electron changes from one orbit to another a PHOTON is emitted or absorbed, the wa v elength of which corresponds to the energy difference between the two levels. Since the orbits are fixed, so too are the energy differences, and thus the photons are emit- ted or absorbed at only specific wavelengths, giving rise to the lines observed in a SPECTRUM . The electron energies are determined by quantum numbers; the principal quantum number, n , the azimuthal quantum number, l , the magnetic quantum number, m l , and the spin, m s . These numbers can take values: n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... ∞ ; l = 0, 1, 2, ... n \u0002 1; m l = 0, ±1, ±2, ... ±l; m s =± \u0001 \u0002 . The value of n determines the shell occupied by the electron, with n =1 corresponding to the K shell, n =2 to the L shell, n =3 to the M shell, and so on. The v alue of l determines the ellipticity of the orbit, l = n \u0002 1 gi v es a circular orbit; smaller values of l correspond to increasingly more elliptical orbits. The PA ULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE requires that no two electrons within an atom can have the same set of quan- tum numbers, and its operation determines the electron structure of the atom and so the properties of the chemical elements. For n = 1, the other quantum numbers must be l = 0, m l = 0, and m s = ± \u0001 \u0002 . The K shell can thus contain at most two electrons, with quantum numbers, n = 1, l =0, m l = 0, m s = \u0003 \u0001 \u0002 and n = 1, l = 0, m l = 0, and m s = \u0002 \u0001 \u0002 . Thus we have helium with two electrons in the K shell and a nucleus with two protons and (normally) two neutrons. Hydrogen has just one electron in the K shell. But the third element, lithium, has to have one electron in the L shell as well as two in the K shell, and so on. The maxi- mum number of electrons in each shell is 2 n 2 , so the L shell is filled for the tenth element, neon, and the eleventh, sodium, has two electrons in the K shell, eight in the L shell, and one in the M shell. Atoms with completed shells are chemically very unreactive, giving the noble gases, helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon and radon. atomic time System of accurately measuring intervals of time based on the transitions between energy levels of the caesium-133 atom. When an atom of caesium changes from a lower-energy level to a higher one, it absorbs radiation of a very precise frequency, namely 9,192,631,770 Hz. This varies by less than one part in 10 billion and has therefore been used to define the basic unit of time, the SI second, which is used in international timekeeping. In 1967 the SI second was defined as being ‘the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium- 133 atom’. Prior to this, the second was defined in terms of the mean solar day and astronomical observations provided a definitive measure of time to which clocks were accord- ingly adjusted to keep them in step. The Earth, however, is not a good timekeeper; its rotation rate is irregular and slowing due to the effects of tidal braking. With the advent of more accurate quartz clocks, followed in 1955 by the caesium-beam atomic clock, it therefore became neces- sary to re-define the standard unit for measuring time. T oday’s atomic clocks are now accurate to one second within a few thousand years and are used to form INTER - NATIONAL ATOMIC TIME (TAI).

Aura Abbreviation of ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES FOR RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY Auriga See feature article aurora Illumination of the night sky, known popularly as the northern and southern lights, produced when elec- trons accelerated in Earth’s MAGNETOSPHERE collide with a tomic oxygen and molecular and atomic nitrogen in the upper atmosphere, at altitudes in excess of 80 km (50 mi). These collisions produce excitation, and as the atmos- pheric particles return to their ground state, they re-emit the excess energy as light at discrete wavelengths; aurorae are often coloured green and red. Geographically, the aurora is present more or less per- manently in two oval regions, encircling either geomagnet- ic pole. The ovals show a marked offset, being on average 20º from the pole on the dayside, 30º on the nightside. Under normal conditions, the ovals remain comparatively narrow and are confined to high latitudes. Release of stress within the magnetosphere gives rise to occasional brighten- ings of the ovals, with a westward-travelling surge of increased activity during substorms, of which as many as five may occur each day even in quiescent conditions. atomic mass unit 42 A \u0001 atomic structure The Bohr–Sommerfeld model of atomic structure visualizes electrons orbiting around the nucleus in discrete shells.

During the biggest disturbances, each oval brightens and broadens, particularly on the nightside, pushing auroral activity towards the equator. During such expansions, the aurora can become visible from lower latitudes, such as those of the British Isles and southern USA. Aurorae at these lati- tudes are most commonly seen a year or so ahead of sunspot maximum, with a secondary, less intense peak 12–18 months after sunspot maximum. During a major display at lower latitudes, the aurora may first appear as a structureless glow over the pole- wards horizon. The glow may rise higher, taking on the form of an arc, with folding giving rise to a ribbon-like structure described as a band. Arcs and bands may be homogeneous, lacking internal structure, or may show long, vertical striations known as rays. Individual rays can appear like searchlight beams, stretching over the hori- zon. Where a rayed band has a high vertical extent, its movement gives rise to the commonly portrayed ‘curtain’ effect. If a display is particularly intense, the rays and other features may pass overhead and on into the equa- torwards half of the sky. At this stage – which is compara- tively rare in displays at lower latitudes – the aurora takes on the form of a corona, with rays appearing to converge on the observer’s magnetic zenith as a result of perspec- tive. Corona formation often marks the short-lived peak of an auroral display, following which activity again retreats polewards. In the most major low-latitude storms – perhaps three or four times in each roughly 11-year sunspot cycle – activity may go on all night, with several coronal episodes separated by quieter interludes. As well as showing occasionally rapid movement, auro- ral features change in brightness. Some changes are slow (pulsing), others rapid (flaming – waves of brightening sweeping upwards from the horizon). No two displays are ever quite the same, and at lower latitudes the most an observer might see on many occasions are simply the upper parts of a display as a horizon glow towards the pole. It is from this appearance, the ‘northern dawn’ (a descrip- tion first used in the 6th century by Gregory of Tours), that the aurora borealis takes its name. Increased auroral activity is often found in the declin- ing years of the sunspot cycle at times when Earth becomes immersed in persistent high-speed SOLAR WIND streams. These coronal hole-associated aurorae are much less dynamic and extensive than the events that follow coronal mass ejections, and they often recur at intervals of 27 days, roughly equivalent to the Sun’s rota- tion period as seen from Earth. Activity from these dis- plays usually comprises a quiet homogeneous arc, with only occasional rayed outbursts, and often lasts for sev- eral successive nights. Auroral rayed bands may have a vertical extent of sev- eral hundred kilometres and a lateral extent covering tens of degrees in longitude. Their base extent in latitude, however, is only a few kilometres, reflecting the narrow field-aligned sheets along which electrons undergo their final acceleration in the near-Earth magnetosphere before impacting on the upper atmosphere. The aurora shows an emission spectrum that is brightest at its red end. The human eye, however, is most sensitive to the green oxygen 557.7 nm emission, which predominates in the aurora at altitudes of about 100 km (62 mi). Higher up, from about 150–600 km (90–370 mi) altitude, red oxygen emissions are found; auroral rays often show a colour gradation from green at their base to red at the top. At extreme altitudes of 1000 km (600 mi), molecular nitrogen can produce pur- ple emissions under further excitation by solar ultraviolet radiation. During intense displays, the lower border of bands may show red nitrogen emissions. Ionization produced during auroral activity enhances the ionospheric E layer at 112 km (70 mi) altitude. Radio operators can use the aurora to scatter short-wave signals over longer-than-normal distances to make ‘DX’ contacts. Doppler shifts allow radar measurements of the particle motions in auroral arcs. References to the aurora are found in pre-Christian, Greek, Chinese, Japanese and Korean texts. European medieval church records often mention ‘battles’ in the sky, equating the auroral red emissions with blood; such imagery also appears in Viking chronicles. Treated with due caution, such records provide useful information on solar-terrestrial activity from pre-telescopic times. Scientific investigations of the aurora began in earnest in the 18th century, with the work of Edmond HALLEY , Jean-Jacques de Mairan (1678–1771) and others. The first modern account of the aurora australis was made by Captain Cook in 1773. The long-suspected connection between solar activity and the aurora was confirmed when a major solar flare was observed in 1859, followed a day or so later by a huge auroral storm. Theoretical work and experiments by Kristian Birkeland (1867–1917) and Carl Störmer (1874–1957) in the early 20th century began to clarify some of the mechanisms by which the aurora occurs. Störmer undertook an intensive pro- gramme of parallactic auroral photography from Norway beginning in 1911. Great progress in understanding the global distribution of auroral activity was made during A AURIGA ( GEN . AURIGAE , ABBR .

Continuing investigations of the aurora, which is the most visible of several effects on near-Earth space result- ing from the Sun’s varying activity, are further aided by observations from spacecraft, which can directly sample particles in the solar wind and magnetosphere, and image the auroral ovals from above. Australia Telescope Compact Array See A USTRALIA TELESCOPE NATIONAL FACILITY Australia Telescope Long Baseline Array See A USTRALIA TELESCOPE NATIONAL FACILITY Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) Set of eight radio telescopes that can be used either individually or together. Six of the telescopes, at Narrabri in New South Wales, constitute the Australia Telescope Compact Ar ray . Each dish has an aperture of 22 m (72 ft). A seventh 22-m antenna, the Mopra Telescope, is located near SIDING SPRING OBSERVATORY , 100 km (60 mi) to the south-west. The final component is the P ARKES RADIO TELESCOPE , a further 220 km (140 mi) away. When all eight instruments are used together they constitute the Australia Telescope Long Baseline Array . The ATNF is funded by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). autoguider Electronic device that ensures a TELESCOPE accurately tracks the apparent movement of a celestial object across the sky. Although a telescope is driven about its axes to compensate for the rotation of the Earth, it is still necessary to make minor corrections, particularly during the course of a long observation. An autoguider achieves this by using a photoelectric device, such as a quadrant photodiode or a CCD, to detect any drifting of the image. The light-sensitive surface of the detector is divided into four quarters, with light from a bright guide star in the field of view focused at the exact centre. If the image wanders from the centre into one of the four quadrants, an electrical current is produced. By knowing from which quadrant this emanated, it is possible to correct the telescope drive to bring the image back to the exact centre again. autumnal equinox Moment at which the Sun’s centre appears to cross the CELESTIAL EQUATOR from south to north, on or near September 23 each year at the FIRST POINT OF LIBRA . At the time of the EQUINOX , the Sun is directly overhead at the equator and rises and sets due east and due west respectively on that day, the hours of daylight and darkness being equal in length. The term is also used as an alternative name for the First Point of Libra, one of the two points where the celestial equator intersects the ECLIPTIC . The effects of PRECESSION cause these points to move westwards along the ecliptic at a rate of about one- seventh of an arcsecond per day.

He compiled many important star catalogues, and computed the orbits of the binaries Sirius and Procyon before astronomers confirmed the existence of those bright stars’ faint companions by direct observation. Auzout, Adrien (1622–91) French astronomer who, independently of William GASCOIGNE , invented the micrometer. He developed the wire micrometer for measuring separations in the eyepiece, and was one of the first to fit graduated setting circles to telescopes to facilitate the measurement of coordinates. As a member of the ‘Paris School’ of scientists, which also included Giovanni Domenico Cassini, Jean Picard, Ole Römer and Christiaan Huygens, Auzout was instrumental in founding P ARIS OBSERVATORY . averted vision Te chnique for viewing faint objects through a telescope. The retina of the eye is equipped with two different types of photoreceptors: cone cells and rod cells. Cone cells are responsible for colour vision and respond only to high levels of light; rod cells are more sensitive to light, but do not provide colour vision. This is why colours cannot be seen under low levels of light. The fovea, a small area of the retina located directly behind the lens, contains only cones, so when one looks directly at an object, no rods are used. A dim object that cannot be seen when viewed directly will often come into view if one looks slightly to the side. This allows light from the object to fall on a region of the retina populated by rods, which are about 40 times (equivalent to a difference of 4 stellar magnitudes) as sensitive as cones. The best averted vision is achieved when the object is about 8º to 16º away from the fovea, towards the nose. The regions above and below the fovea are almost as sensitive, but the area towards the ear should be avoided since the blind spot (where the optic nerve enters the eye) is 13º to 18º in that direction.

It was renamed the CHANDRA X - RAY OBSERVATORY . axion Elementary particle proposed to explain the lack of CP (Charge and Parity) violation in strong interactions. Axions have been proposed as a type of COLD DARK MATTER , the mass of which contributes to the gravitational potential in galaxy haloes, thus helping to explain the radial v elocity curves of galaxies. Recent background radiation measurements and Hubble Space Telescope observations of brown dwarfs in the haloes of galaxies have limited the need for axions in cosmology. axis Imaginary line through a celestial body, which joins its north and south poles, and about which it rotates or has rotational symmetry. The angle between this spin axis and the perpendicular to its orbital plane is called the axial inclination, which in the case of the Earth is 23º.45. In the cases of Venus, Uranus and Pluto, the v alues exceed 90º, because their axial spins are RETROGRADE . The gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon on the Earth’s equatorial bulge causes its rotational axis to describe a circle over a period of 25,800 years, an effect known as PRECESSION . If a body possesses a magnetic field, its rotational and magnetic axes do not necessarily coincide. On the Earth the two are inclined at about 10º.8 to one another, while on Uranus the magnetic axis lies at 58º.6 to the rotational axis and is also offset from the centre of the planet. azimuth Angular distance of an object measured w estwards around the horizon from due north at 0º, through due east at 90º, due south at 180º and so on. An object’s azimuth is determined by the vertical circle (meridian) running through it. Azimuth is one of the two coordinates in the horizontal (or horizon) coordinate system, the other being ALTITUDE .

From 1919 to 1931 Baade worked at Ger- many’s Hamburg Observatory, where he made many observations of a wide variety of celestial objects – comets, asteroids, variable stars and star clusters, and galaxies. He discovered the unusual asteroids HIDALGO (1920) and ICARUS (1949). His skills as an observer were recognized by the Rockefeller Foundation, which award- ed him a scholarship in 1929 to pursue his work at Mount Wilson Observatory. Two years later he became a staff member there, where he remained until 1959, using the 100-inch (2.5-m) Hooker Telescope and, later, Mount Palomar’s 200-inch (5-m) Hale Telescope, to accumulate a large number of high-quality photographic plates of the Milky Way’s stars, clusters and nebulae, as well as many galaxies. In 1934 Baade proposed, with Fritz ZWICKY , that neu- tron stars were the end product of SUPERNOVAE and that many cosmic rays originated from these violent explo- sions of supermassive stars. With Zwicky and Rudolph MINKOWSKI he classified supernovae into two types that differed in their absolute magnitudes and spectral char- acteristics. With Minkowski, he identified the optical counterparts of the Cygnus A and Cassiopeia A radio sources. Observing extensively during the World War II blackout of Los Angeles, which darkened Mount Wil- son’s skies, Baade was able to resolve for the first time stars in the core of the ANDROMEDA GALAXY (M31), as well as in its companions, M32 and NGC 205. In 1944 he announced that the Milky Way consists of younger, metal-rich, highly luminous (usually blue) Population I stars found mostly in our Galaxy’s spiral arms, and older, reddish Population II stars of the galactic nucleus and halo. Baade also discovered that there are two popu- lations of CEPHEID VARIABLES . In 1952 and 1953 he used the new Hale Telescope to measure more accurately the brightness of Cepheid and RR LYRAE VARIABLES . He found no Cepheids in M31, but they should have been visible if the galaxy lay at the distance then currently believed, so he reasoned that M31 had to be at least twice as distant – a discovery that necessitated the dou- bling of the cosmic distance scale. Baade’s Window Best known of several small regions in the sky where there is a partial clearing of the dust clouds towards the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. Through these ‘windows’ it is possible visually to observe objects that are within and beyond the central bulge of the Galaxy. Baade’s window is about three- quarters of a degree northwest of \u0001 Sgr and surrounds the globular cluster NGC 6522. It is 4º east of the galac- tic centre and so lines-of-sight through the window pass within about 1800 l.y. of the centre. The region is named after Walter BAADE . Babcock, Harold Delos (1882–1968) American astronomer who, as a long-serving staff member at Mount Wilson Observatory (1908–48), made many discoveries about solar and stellar magnetic fields. In 1908 he detect- ed an extremely weak solar magnetic field. After several decades of studying the solar spectrum with a magneto- graph, he was able accurately to measure the strength of the Sun’s magnetic field and its variability. With his son Horace BABCOCK , he discovered that other stars possess strong magnetic fields. Babcock, Horace Welcome (1912– ) American astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory and the son of Harold BABCOCK , with whom he co-invented the solar magnetograph, an instrument used to study the Sun’s magnetic field and its variation. He also designed and built many instruments for the telescopes of Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories, including diffraction gratings, photometers, guiding electronics, polarizers and spectro- graphs. He was the first (1953) to propose the technique known as ADAPTIVE OPTICS . Babylonian astronomy Astronomy as practised in Mesopotamia by various cultures from early in the 2nd millennium BC to about the 1st century AD . The city of Babylon was the dominant influence in this region for much of this period. It was established by King Hammurabi (1792–1750 BC ) on the banks of the Euphrates, about 100 km (60 mi) south of Baghdad. Apart from periods of independence, it was successively controlled by Hittites, Kassites, Assyrians and Persians before its conquest in 311 BC by Alexander the Great. Thanks to the preservation of Babylonian written records on baked clay tablets from around 700 BC onwards, Babylonian mathematics and astronomical observations can be traced further back than those of other peoples. From Babylon came the sexagesimal system of numbers, based on 60 rather than our familiar 10. The subdivisions of the hour into 60 minutes and the minute into 60 seconds, and of the degree into 60 arcminutes and the arcminute into 60 arcseconds, are the legacy of this system. Like many other ancient peoples, the Babylonians used a mixed luni-solar calendar, with extra months inserted when necessary to correct for the fact that there are between 12 and 13 lunar months in one year. They kept accurate records of celestial events and eventually ( c .5th century BC ) recognized the METONIC CYCLE (that a times- pan of 235 lunar months is very close to 19 solar years). They set up a predictable calendar based on this relation- ship. By studying the motions of the planets they were able to identify cycles in their behaviour and could con- struct predictive almanacs (ephemerides). They also rec- ognized that the annual apparent motion of the Sun appears to be uneven, and they developed a simple model to allow for this when predicting its position. Although most of the surviving Babylonian records date from after 700 BC , a compilation of celestial omens that supposedly warned of impending disasters, called the Enu ̄ ma Anu Enlil, contains references to events dating back to the 3rd millennium BC . This text was used to B B Babylonian astronomy 45 \u0001 Baade’s Window The partial clearing of dust clouds known as Baade’s Window allowed Walter Baade to observe stars near the centre of the Milky Way, including RR Lyrae variables. He used the period–luminosity relation to calculate their absolute magnitude and thus calculated the distance of the Solar System from the centre of our Galaxy.

Out of the recording and interpretation of celestial omens came ‘diaries’ of the movements of the Sun, Moon and planets, the discovery of cycles in these movements, and eventually a mathematical model of these movements built around arithmetical sequences. The precision of the Babylonian observations was complementary to the more speculative nature of Greek astronomy. After Alexander’s conquest of Babylon drew their attention to Babylonian achievements, Greek astronomers such as HIPPARCHUS became interested in making precise observations and in developing geometri- cal models that fitted the data.

Bailey, Solon Irving (1854–1931) American astronomer at Harvard College (1887–1931) who pio- neered photographic surveys of the southern skies from Pe ru and South Africa. In 1889 Bailey made the first of several expeditions to South America to find a suitable locale for Harvard’s Boyden Station, and eventually chose a site near Arequipa, Peru, at an altitude of 2500 m (8200 ft). From there, Bailey measured the brightness and positions of almost 8000 stars visible only from the southern hemisphere, and studied over 500 va r iable stars in the globular clusters \u0001 Centauri, M3, M5 and M15. In 1908, from Cape Colony (modern South Africa), Bailey completed a photographic survey of the southern regions of the Milky Way. Bailly V ast lunar enclosure (67ºS 63ºW), 298 km (185 mi) in diameter, described as a ‘field of ruins’. Though technically the largest of the Moon’s walled plains, Bailly is a difficult feature to make out because of its location at the south-west limb and its broken-down w alls. Its rims rise to heights of 4250 m (14,000 ft) in some places, but in others are barely discernible. Bailly’s floor lacks a central peak, but it does include two sizeable craters, known as Bailly A and B, and many smaller impact sites. Baily, Francis (1774–1844) English stockbroker and amateur astronomer whose description of the phenome- non visible during annular and total solar eclipses now known as BAILY ’ S BEADS , published in 1838, was the first to attract attention. Baily also made the first highly accu- rate calculation of the Earth’s mean density. Baily’s beads Phenomenon usually seen at SECOND CONTACT and THIRD CONTACT of a total SOLAR ECLIPSE , when several dazzling spots of the Sun’s photosphere become visible through depressions in the Moon’s irregu- lar limb. Baily’s beads may also be visible when the Moon at an ANNULAR ECLIPSE only just appears too small com- pletely to cover the Sun. Indeed, it was at just such an eclipse, seen from Jedburgh in Scotland on 1836 May 15, that Francis BAILY first described the ‘row of lucid points, like a string of bright beads’ around the Moon’s limb, from which the phenomenon takes its name. Baker–Schmidt camera Form of SCHMIDT CAMERA used for photographing meteors; it incorporates design modifications by J.G. Baker. With a typical focal ratio of f /0.67, the Baker–Schmidt camera employs near-spher- oidal primary and secondary mirrors, together with a cor- recting plate, which produce a wide, flat field of view and images that are largely free from CHROMATIC ABERRATION , ASTIGMATISM and distortion.

He dis- covered several galaxies with the ‘Leviathan of Parson- stown’, Lord R OSSE ’s g reat 72-inch (1.8-m) reflecting telescope. Ball supported the nebular hypothesis of the Solar System’s origin, according to which the Sun and planets condensed from a hot primordial cloud of gas. He believed that meteorites were produced by terrestrial vol- canoes and expelled by violent eruptions, falling back to the ground after temporarily orbiting our planet. balloon astronomy Astronomical research carried out using instruments flown on balloons. In the late 19th cen- tury, scientists began using balloons to lift telescopes and other astronomical instruments above the turbulent lower a tmosphere. Even after the advent of RO CKET ASTRONOMY and ARTIFICIAL SATELLITES , the convenience and cheap- ness of balloons ensured their continued use for research and testing new space technology. The development of high-altitude balloons was an important spur for balloon astronomy. Recent applications include study of the cos- mic microwave background (CMB); balloons have also been used in planetary exploration. The first astronomical use of balloons was probably in 1874 when Jules JANSSEN sponsored two aeronauts in an unsuccessful attempt to record the solar spectrum with a small hand-held spectroscope. In 1899 July, an automatic photographic spectrograph developed by Aymar de la Baume-Pluvinel (1860–1938) demonstrated that water v apour in the Earth’s atmosphere was showing up in the solar spectrum. Victor HESS discovered cosmic rays with a balloon-borne electroscope in 1912; further cosmic-ray studies were conducted in the 1930s by twin scientists J ean Piccard (1884–1963) and Auguste Piccard (1884–1962), who ascended in a balloon to above 20,000 m (65,000 ft). The first use of a balloon-borne astronomical telescope w as by Audouin Charles Dollfus (1924– ) on 1954 May 30, during an attempt to detect water vapour in the Mart- ian atmosphere. A few years later, Dollfus and the English astronomer Donald Eustace Blackwell (1921– ) took the first astronomical photographs from the air; their high- B AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 10:28 am Page 46"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"resolution images of the Sun’s photosphere proved that solar GRANULATION w as the product of internal convec- tion. Higher-flying unmanned balloons were pioneered by Martin SCHWARZSCHILD with Stratoscope I, whose 0.3-m (12-in.) automated Sun-pointing telescope recorded sharper images of the granulation and the photosphere from an altitude of 24,000 m (79,000 ft). Stratoscope II, which carried a 0.86-m (34-in.) telescope, obtained infrared spectra of the Martian atmosphere and red giant stars during its first flights in 1963. Large, high-altitude, unmanned helium balloons are still used for both astronomical observations and for trials of new technologies and payloads for space missions. Observations at X-ray, gamma-ray and infrared wave- lengths continue to be made from balloons. Some of the most significant balloon-borne campaigns of recent years have involved studies of the CMB. In the Boomerang experiment (1998/1999), a balloon- borne 1.2-m (48-in.) telescope circumnavigated Antarcti- ca, taking measurements at four frequencies to separate faint galactic emissions from the CMB. The resultant map covered approximately 2.5% of the sky with an angular resolution 35 times better than had been achieved by the COSMIC BACKGROUND EXPLORER satellite, revealing varia- tions as small as 0.0001 K in the temperature of the CMB. Similar endeavours include MAXIMA (Millimetre Anisotropy Experiment Imaging Array), balloon-borne millimetre-wave telescopes designed to measure fluctua- tions in the CMB. MAXIMA 1 (1998 August) observed 124 square degrees of sky, while MAXIMA 2 (1999 June) observed roughly twice that area. The CMB and interstellar dust in our Galaxy were also observed by submillimetre telescopes on the 3-t French PRONAOS (Programme National d’Astronomie Submil- limétrique) stratospheric balloons in 1994, 1996 and 1999. The successor to PRONAOS is the Elisa interna- tional project to observe the interstellar medium. 2000 June saw the inaugural balloon flight of Claire, the first gamma-ray telescope to use a separate detector and col- lector. A follow-up flight with an improved version took place in 2001 June. Extremely large balloons that can stay aloft for up to 100 days are now being designed. The 30-day maiden flight of NASA’s Ultra Long Duration Balloon (ULDB), carrying the Trans-Iron Galactic Element Recorder (TIGER) experiment, began in Antarctica on 2001 December 21. TIGER is designed to measure the abun- dances of elements from iron to zirconium in galactic cos- mic rays. The ULDB is a pressurized balloon made of extremely strong materials, such as polyester, inside which the helium gas is sealed. The balloon maintains a constant v olume and so stays at the same altitude. The French pio- neered the use of such balloons to explore other worlds. Tw o helium balloons were delivered by Soviet VEGA spacecraft into the atmosphere of Venus on 1985 June 11 and 15. Inflated about 54 km (34 mi) above the surface, each lasted for about 46 \u0001 \u0002 hours, and travelled more than a third of the way around the planet. T raditional ‘Montgolfier’ hot-air or ‘zero-pressure’ balloons are much lighter and more easily deployed than their helium counterparts, and have potential for flights above other planets. Infrared Montgolfiers could not operate at Mars during the very cold nights, but a novel hot-air venting system could allow repeated, precision soft landings. Although they would be limited to daytime flights – up to 10 hours at lower Martian latitudes, or perhaps months during the long polar summers – such balloons could drag an instrumented ‘snake’ over the surface or soft-land a large rover, re-ascend, and contin- ue imaging before landing again, possibly with a ‘nanorover’, at dusk. Other Montgolfier balloon missions that could explore the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter and Titan are under study.

Bappu, (Manali Kallat) Vainu (1927–82) Indian astronomer and director of the Kodaikanal Observatory who, while at Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories, discovered with Olin Chaddock Wilson (1909–94) the Wilson–Bappu effect, relating the luminosity of a late-type star to the strength of its calcium K line. He pioneered ultra-low dispersion spectroscopy of stars and galaxies, and made important studies of red stars in the Magellanic Clouds and of planetary ring systems. bar Non-SI unit by which pressure is measured. It is par- ticularly used in astronomy to describe the pressure in a planetary atmosphere, one bar being equivalent to the av erage atmospheric pressure on the Earth at sea level. Atmospheric pressure is often quoted in millibars, one bar being equal to 1000 millibars. barium star Giant GSTAR or KSTAR with an excess of carbon, barium, strontium and other heavy elements (including those from slow neutron capture) in its a tmosphere. Barium stars have white dwarf companions. They most likely result from MASS TRANSFER that took place when the current barium star was a dwarf and the white dwarf was an evolving, chemically enriched, mass- losing giant. Barium stars are loosely related to CH and dwarf CARBON STARS . Barlow lens Concave (negative) LENS placed between a telescope objective and eyepiece to increase the magnifica- tion, usually by two or three times. The negative lens reduces the angle of convergence of the light cone, effec- tively making it appear to the eyepiece that the primary has a longer focal length. It was invented in the early 1800s by English physicist Peter Barlow (1776–1872).

His observing skills w on him a position at the new Lick Observatory in 1887, where he became the first astronomer to discover a comet using photography. At Lick, Barnard used the 36-inch (0.9-m) refractor to prove the transparency of Saturn’s C Ring (1889) and to discover Amalthea (1892), the last planetary satellite to be found without the aid of photogra- phy. Three years later, he moved to the Yerkes Observato- ry , where he remained for the rest of his life, making numerous detailed visual observations of the planets and comets with the 40-inch (1-m) refractor.

Barnard’s Loop (Sh2-276) Large, diffuse and very faint arc of nebulosity centred on the Orion OB ASSOCIA - TION , which is the group of hot stars south of Orion’s Belt. The nebula is visible only on the eastern and south- ern sides of the constellation. Barnard’s Loop was named after the pioneer astronomical photographer Edward Emerson BARNARD , who discovered it in 1894. If it were a complete ring, Barnard’s Loop would almost com- pletely fill the region between Betelgeuse and Rigel, cov- ering almost 20º of sky. Barnard’s Loop appears to be a structure resulting from clearance of dust and gas in the interstellar medium by radiation pressure from the Orion OB association stars. Barnard’s Star Closest star to the Sun after the \u0001 Cen- tauri triple system, lying 5.9 l.y. away in the constellation Ophiuchus, with a visual magnitude of only 9.54, well below naked-eye visibility. It is a red dwarf, spectral type M4, with only 0.05% of the Sun’s luminosity. Discovered in 1916 by Edward Emerson BARNARD , it has the largest PROPER MOTION of any star, 10 \u0002 .4 per year – so fast that it moves across the sky a distance equivalent to the Moon’s apparent diameter in under two centuries. In the 1960s and 1970s the Dutch-American astronomer Peter Van de Kamp (1901–95) reported an apparent wobble in the proper motion of the star, which he attributed to the pres- ence of two orbiting planets similar in size to Jupiter and Saturn. This was not confirmed, and the star’s apparent ‘wobble’ seems to have been due to instrumental error ( see also EXTRASOLAR PLANET ). barn-door mount See SCOTCH MOUNT barred spiral galaxy SPIRAL GALAXY in which the distri- b ution of stars near the nucleus is elongated in the disk plane. Strong bars are reflected in the HUBBLE CLASSIFICA - TION . Weaker bars are common among spirals, with the de Vaucouleurs types indicating that about 60% of spirals have distinct bars. Infrared observations, less sensitive to dust absorption and the confusing influence of young stars, may indicate an even greater fraction of spirals with small or weak bars, among them our Galaxy. Stellar dynamics in a disk can produce a bar because of instabili- ties, and a bar in turn may dissolve into a ring structure ov er cosmic time. Indeed, many bars are accompanied by stellar rings. Bars can alter the chemical content of a galaxy’s gas, since flow along the bar mixes gas originally located at a wide range of radii, which thus started with different chemical compositions.

Basalts are abundant on Earth, the Moon, Venus and Mars, forming vast plains and volcanic constructs. They are probably abundant on Mercury and on Jupiter’s satellite Io, where they also form plains. Basalts make up the surfaces of some asteroids, such as VESTA . Basalt is formed by solidification of partial- ly melted planet MANTLE material. basin Extensive topographically depressed area. In planetary science the term basin is commonly used with the adjective multi-ring. Multi-ring basins are circular depressions of a few tens to about 4000 km (2500 mi) in diameter; they typically have an elevated rim and one or two concentric rings of elevated terrain inside. They are observed on Mercury, Venus and Mars, as well as on large satellites, including the Moon. A multi-ring basin is an impact feature created by a collision with a comet or an asteroid: it is a type of impact CRATER . The onset diameter at which an impact crater becomes sufficiently large to form a multi-ring basin depends on the character of the target material (for example rock or ice) and on the body’s gravitational acceleration. The onset diameter is 40–70 km (20–40 mi) on Venus, 100–130 km B Barnard’s Loop 48 \u0001 barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 in Fornax has a prominent bar and open arms.

BD Abbreviation of BONNER DURCHMUSTERUNG Beagle 2 UK Mars lander, almost 50% funded by the EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA), which will be launched in 2003 June, flying piggyback on ESA’s MARS EXPRESS orbiter. The spacecraft will arrive at Mars in 2003 December. The 30-kg Beagle 2 will land at a site in the ISIDIS PLANITIA region at about 13ºN latitude, which is the best site given the constraints for a safe landing in a smooth area and the scientific objectives of the mission. Beagle will take samples of Martian soil and analyse it for signs of water and bacterial activity, as well as investigating the chemical isotopes present. It will also measure methane in the atmosphere and send back images of the surface. Beagle is being part-sponsored by commercial companies. The project is being managed by the UK’s Open University. It will make a bouncy landing encased in inflated balloons, which will be detached as it comes to rest. If Beagle 2 touches down successfully on Mars, it will become only the fourth spacecraft, after the US VIKINGS 1 and 2 in 1976 and MARS PATHFINDER in 1997, to do so.

Bessel, Friedrich Wilhelm (1784–1846) German astronomer and mathematician who was the first to mea- sure stellar PARALLAX . In 1804, while employed as a shipping clerk, he calculated the orbit of Halley’s Comet, which impressed Wilhelm OLBERS sufficiently to recom- mend that he be hired as assistant to Johann SCHRÖTER . At Schröter’s private observatory in Lilienthal, Ger- many, Bessel observed Saturn and its rings and satellites, and comets. He continued to develop mathematical methods for celestial mechanics; it was while trying to solve the three-body problem of celestial mechanics (1817–24) that he developed the class of mathematical functions that bear his name ( see BESSELIAN ELEMENTS ). He reduced the positions for 3222 fundamental stars first observed by James BRADLEY at Greenwich Observa- tory between 1750 and 1762; his 1818 publication of over 63,000 star positions and proper motions, based on his and Bradley’s observations, are considered the start of modern ASTROMETRY . In 1809 Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia appointed Bessel director of a new observatory at Königsberg. Bessel’s most famous achievement was his 1838 mea- surement of the parallax of the star 61 Cygni. He chose this relatively obscure star because of its high proper motion. Using Königsberg’s Fraunhofer heliometer, Bessel determined that 61 Cygni has a parallax of 0 \u0003 .31 (very close to the modern value of 0 \u0003 .29), implying that the star was 10 l.y. from Earth. The Royal Astronomical Society awarded him its Gold Medal for this achievement, which marked the first step towards accurately measuring stellar distances. Bessel’s 1840 paper on perturbations to Uranus’ orbit suggested the existence of an eighth planet, six years before the discovery of Neptune by Johann GALLE . In 1841/1844 he predicted the existence of dark companions of Sirius and Procyon after discovering peri- odic variations in their proper motions – Sirius B was not confirmed until 1862. Besselian elements These arise in a method devised by Friedrich BESSEL for calculating the circumstances of an ECLIPSE . For a solar eclipse a reference plane is used that is normal to the line passing through the centres of the Sun and Moon, and which passes through the centre of the Earth. The Earth’s limb and the shadow of the Moon are projected on to this plane, and an eclipse will occur if the shadow intersects the limb. The Besselian elements define the location of the centre of the Moon relative to the centre of the Earth and the radii of the umbral and penumbral shadows within this plane, and the direction of projection. Be star BSTAR that shows a characteristic B-type spec- trum with the addition of hydrogen emission lines.

Beta Lyrae (Sheliak) Variable star that shows continu- ous variations in brightness; it is the prototype for one of the three subtypes of ECLIPSING BINARY . The Arabic name, Sheliak, comes from the Arabic for ‘harp’. The star lies at a distance of 882 l.y.; its magnitude varies between 3.3 and 4.4. Small telescopes reveal a faint, mag. 7.2 companion. The variability and periodicity of Beta Lyrae were discovered in 1784 by John GOODRICKE . The first complete light-curve, obtained in 1859 by F. W .A. ARGELANDER , demonstrated that Beta Lyrae is an eclipsing binary. All BETA LYRAE STARS show continuous magnitude va ri a tion between minima, resulting in a light-curve that has distinct primary and secondary minima. The dou- ble-humped light-curve of Beta Lyrae indicates that the stars are deformed into ellipsoids by their mutual gravi- tational interaction. Because the period is only 12.93854 days, the two stars must be so close to each other it becomes inevitable that significant tidal distortion in their shapes occurs. The light-curve can be explained by the changing total amount of stellar surface area present- ed to the Earth-based observer as the elongated stars revolve about each other. Spectroscopic observations in the 1950s established that the primary star is a late-type B giant (B8.5II), but classification of the secondary was confounded by pecu- liar spectral features, some of which are caused by gas flowing between the stars and around the system as a whole. The secondary star is roughly four to five times more massive than the primary. According to the mass–luminosity relation, however, the more massive a star is, the brighter it is. Astronomers were puzzled because the massive secondary appeared significantly under-luminous, much dimmer than the primary. Current theories about Beta Lyrae, supported by observations, suggest that the secondary star is enveloped in a thick A CCRETION DISK of gas captured from the primary. Material surrounding the secondary so severely subdues its luminosity that the star itself is impossible to observe. The primary star is overflowing its R OCHE LOBE , and gas streams across the inner LAGRANGIAN POINT on to the disk at the rate of 10 \u0001 5 solar masses per year. Ultraviolet spectra from the OA O-3 (Copernicus) and Skylab orbiting observatories revealed clouds of gas at the L 4 and L 5 Lagrangian points. Gas is constantly escaping from the system. Beta Lyrae star ECLIPSING BINARY (subtype EB) that shows a continuous variation in brightness throughout the orbital period, which is generally of one day or more in length. Both primary and secondary minima are always present. Although once thought to be CONTACT BINARIES (that is, systems that have tidally distorted com- ponents with a common atmospheric envelope, as in W URSAE MAJORIS STARS ), the majority of Beta Lyrae stars appear to be semidetached systems in which gas escap- ing from a bloated primary star is falling on to an A CCRE - TION DISK surrounding the secondary star. Such a configuration is found in BETA LYRAE , which is the proto- type for this type. Astronomers now regard Beta Lyrae variables as members of a broad class of double stars known as SEMI - DETACHED BINARIES , so called because only one of the two stars fills its R OCHE LOBE . They are probably binaries near the end of the initial rapid phase of MASS TRANSFER . Thus, some Beta Lyrae variables may evolve into Algol- type binaries ( see ALGOL STAR ). For example, as the pri- mary star in a Beta Lyrae variable continues to evolve aw ay from the main sequence, it will begin to resemble a red subgiant. As the rate of mass transfer subsides, the accretion disk shrouding the secondary may become transparent and a massive unevolved star will shine forth. The resulting system clearly would resemble ALGOL . Beta Lyrae stars, which account for about 20% of all eclipsing variables, are therefore an important but temporary stage in the early evolution of CLOSE BINARY systems.

Beta Pictoris MAIN - SEQUENCE A5 star in the constella- tion Pictor; it has visual magnitude 3.9 and is at a distance of 62 l.y.

The disk is about 400 AU in diameter, some four times the diameter of our Solar System. Both dust and hydrogen gas have been detected in the disk. Spectroscopic studies and dynamical modelling indicate that larger solid bodies ( PLANETESIMALS ) are present, and planets may have formed or be in the process of formation.

Bethe, Hans Albrecht (1906– ) German-American a tomic physicist who discovered the basic nuclear reac- tions that generate energy inside stars. After receiving an education in theoretical physics and holding teaching posi- tions at the universities in Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Munich and Tübingen, Bethe emigrated to England, then to the USA, where he joined the faculty of Cornell University in 1935. During World War II he made significant contribu- tions to the Los Alamos Science Laboratory’s Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bomb, but this w ork convinced him of the importance of nuclear arms control, which he has since strongly advocated. In the 1930s and 1940s, Bethe developed his models for stellar nuclear processes. He found that for stars of modest mass like the Sun, the most important nuclear reaction converts two protons (atomic hydrogen nuclei) into helium; Bethe also discovered that several protons can also combine with a carbon nucleus inside Sun-like stars to regenerate a carbon nucleus and helium ‘ash’. He demonstrated that the powerful gravity of NEUTRON STARS , which are much more massive than the Sun, is sufficient to fuse protons and electrons to make neu- trons. Bethe also modelled the carbon–nitrogen cycle of reactions, which powers many types of massive stars. In 1947 Bethe explained the Lamb shift observed in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom with a model that laid the foundations of a new branch of physics known as quantum electrodynamics.

Biela, Comet 3D/ COMET discovered by Jacques Mon- taigne at Limoges, France, on 1772 March 8 and again by J ean Louis PONS on 1805 November 10. It was next noted by Wilhelm von Biela, an Austrian army officer and amateur astronomer, on 1826 February 27. He real- ized that it was the same as that which had already been observed in 1772 and 1805. It was subsequently named Biela’s Comet and shown to be periodic, with a period of 6.6 years. It was seen again in 1832 and 1845–46. On 1845 December 19 the comet appeared elongated and by the end of the year had split in two. By 1846 March 3 the two parts were over 240,000 km (150,000 mi) apart. At its next return, in 1852, the sepa- ration had increased to 2 million km (1.2 million mi). The comet was never seen again, but in November 1872 and 1885 tremendous showers of ANDROMEDID meteors – produced by debris released on the comet’s disintegration – occurred on exactly the date when the Earth passed close to the comet’s orbit. Bielids Alternative name for the ANDROMEDIDS Big Bang theory Theory concerning the explosive cre- a tion of the Universe from a single point. The first real strides in the study of cosmology occurred when Edwin HUBBLE and his collaborators noticed that all of the galax- ies in the Universe, except for those in our local cluster, w ere receding from us. This fact was determined by mea- suring the REDSHIFT of the absorption lines in galaxy spec- tra. It was further noted that the more distant the galaxy, the faster the velocity of recession. If the galaxy velocities w ere extrapolated back into time, then all galaxies and stars apparently started at some time in the distant past at a single point. This cosmic singularity included not only all of the gas, dust, stars, galaxies and radiation, but all of SPACETIME as well. Tw o types of models came out of these observations and theoretical arguments from general relativity. The STEADY - STATE THEORY pictured the Universe as expand- ing, with matter created between separating galaxies and clusters at precisely the rate needed to keep the average properties of the Universe the same, that is, homogeneous and isotropic. This idea suggested there was no beginning and will be no end, just constant expansion and filling in. The other major cosmological model, the Big Bang theo- ry , held that the entire Universe emerged from a single point in an explosive event called the Big Bang. GENERAL RELATIVITY and the idea of a Big Bang are both consistent with the fact that more distant galaxies separate from each other more rapidly, following a mathematical relationship known as the HUBBLE LAW . The Big Bang model predicted that the temperature of the very early universe was on the order of 10 9 K. At the start of the expansion, between T = 0 and T = 10 \u0003 43 s (the PLANCK TIME ), the laws of physics are not well understood; in fact we would need a ‘ THEORY OF EVERY - THING ’ to be able to describe this era. The temperature continued to drop as the universe expanded. Between 10 \u0003 43 and 10 \u0003 35 s the universe had just two fundamental forces – gravity and the GUT force. After 10 \u0003 35 s, the strong force separated from the electroweak force, but the universe was still far too hot for atoms to form. Final- ly, after about 10 \u0003 12 s the weak and electromagnetic forces became distinct and the four fundamental forces looked as they do today. At 10 \u0003 6 s the temperature had B Beta Regio 52 \u0001 Beta Regio The rift valley Devana Chasma in Beta Regio is as much as 20 km (12 mi) wide and here has cut through an earlier impact crater, which is itself 37 km (23 mi) across.

Sig- nificant NUCLEOSYNTHESIS could begin and the COSMIC ABUNDANCE of elements was determined, primarily h ydrogen and helium. The next significant event was at roughly T = 300,000 years after the Big Bang. At this time the universe became transparent to photons and the radiation decoupled from matter. As the universe contin- ued to expand, matter evolved separately from the COS - MIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND (CMB) and atoms formed. Gravity caused small inhomogeneities in the matter distribution to collapse and form stars, galaxies and galaxy clusters. The Big Bang model made a significant prediction: the Universe should have a temperature, and the temper- a ture could be measured by looking at the CBR that per- meates the entire Universe. Calculations within the framework of the Big Bang indicated that as the Universe expanded, the temperature of the CBR should constant- ly drop and the current temperature should be around 5 K. Two engineers from Bell Labs, Arno PENZIAS and Robert Wilson, were trying to determine why the Holmdel horn antenna, used to communicate with satel- lites, constantly picked up static at microwave frequen- cies. They failed to find a terrestrial or electrical explanation for the static and it was finally deduced that the noise was actually the CBR. This discovery, that the Universe has background radiation at a temperature very close to the theoretical predictions of the Big Bang model, was the most convincing piece of evidence that the Universe actually began as a condensed cosmic sin- gularity many billions of years ago. Later observations by balloon-borne telescopes and the NASA satellite COBE precisely mapped this background radiation, even mea- suring anisotropies and our own motion relative to it. Along with the successes of the Big Bang theory, there w ere also some problems. The horizon problem, the flat- ness problem, the lack of magnetic monopoles and the smoothness of the CBR all presented problems for the Big Bang model. Since the Universe is expanding rapidly in all directions, the two opposite horizons would be out of causal contact, and therefore would not have to show the same level of homogeneity as they do; this is the crux of the horizon problem. The flatness problem suggests that the Universe is so close to critical density that the initial conditions must have been fine tuned to extraordi- nary precision. The lack of magnetic monopoles present in the Universe was also considered a problem. After completely mapping the CBR, there seemed to be dis- crepancies between the amount of mass seen in the Uni- ve r se and the critical density inferred from the smoothness of the CBR. The idea of an INFLATION epoch in the early universe solved both the horizon and flatness problems. Inflationary theory postulates that in the very early universe, just after T = 10 \u0001 34 s, the uni- ve r se expanded rapidly and increased in size by a factor of 10 50 . This rapid expansion was driven by Higgs field symmetry breaking. Because the universe actually expanded faster than the speed of light, the horizons w ere actually in causal contact in the early universe, thus disposing of the horizon problem. The flatness and mag- netic monopole problems also go away since we see only a small part of the entire Universe. There remained a problem. The density of the Universe derived from the CBR should be equal to the critical density according to the Big Bang theory with inflation. Observations of the luminous matter in the Universe fell short of the critical density by a factor of four or more. As observations from space platforms improved, sci- entists concentrated on trying to derive an accurate and consistent value for the HUBBLE CONSTANT . Determining this constant required the distances to distant galaxies to be measured independently of the redshift using bright standard candles like supernovae. Results from superno- va studies indicated that the Universe was not expanding according to a constant value for the Hubble constant, b ut is accelerating. Far from invalidating the Big Bang theory, however, it actually explains the aforementioned problems with the Big Bang theory. To explain the accel- eration, either the COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT must be non-zero or there exists a different form of unobserved matter that has negative gravity, recently termed Q UIN - TESSENCE . Either the non-zero cosmological constant or the presence of this exotic quintessence drives the expansion of the Universe.

The first binary pulsar to be discov- ered was PSR 1913+16, in 1974, for which its discover- ers, Joseph Taylor and Russell HULSE , were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize for physics. The pulsar, with a period of 0.059 seconds, orbits a neutron star with a period of almost 8 hours. Pulses from the companion neutron star have not been detected, but this might only be the result of an unfavourable viewing angle. The pulses from the pul- sar arrive 3 seconds earlier at some times relative to others, showing that the pulsar’s orbit is 3 light-seconds across, approximately the diameter of the Sun. Since this is a binary system, the masses of the two neutron stars can be determined, and they are each around 1–3 times the mass of the Sun. Observations have shown that the pulsar’s orbit is gradually contracting, due to the emission of ener- gy in the form of GRAVITATIONAL WAVES , as predicted by Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY , causing the pul- sar to reach PERIASTRON slightly early. Also, periastron advances 4º per year in longitude due to the gravitational field (thus the pulsar’s periastron moves as far in a day as Mercury’s moves in a century). binary star Double star in which the two components are gravitationally bound to each other and orbit their common centre of mass. More than half of stars observed are binary or belong to multiple systems, with three or more components. In a CLOSE BINARY the stars interact directly with each other. Other double stars are optical doubles, which result when two stars appear to be close because they lie almost on the same line of sight as viewed from Earth, but in reality lie at a vast distance from each other. Binary systems are classified in a vari- ety of ways, including the manner in which their binary nature is known. Common proper motion binaries are seen as distinct objects that move across the sky together. No orbital motion is observed because they lie so far apart that their orbital period is very long. VISUAL BINARIES are pairs that are resolved into separate components and for which orbital motion is observed. ASTROMETRIC BINARIES are systems where only one component is seen. This star is observed to ‘wobble’ in a periodic manner as it moves across the sky, a movement caused by the gravitational pull of the unseen companion. Spectrum binaries are systems where a SPECTROGRAM of an apparently single star reveals two sets of spectral lines characteristic of two different types of stars. SPECTROSCOPIC BINARIES are systems where only one star is observed directly, but its spectrum shows one or two sets of spectral lines, which show a DOPPLER SHIFT , indicating orbital motion. These are known as single- and double-lined spectroscopic binaries respectively. ECLIPSING BINARIES are systems aligned so that one or both members of the system are periodically observed to pass in front or behind the other, causing the total lumi- nosity of the system to fluctuate in a periodic manner. In general the nature of a binary system can be ascer- tained by the distance between the pair and thus the orbital period. Widely separated pairs that do not influ- ence each other are known as double stars. Common proper motion pairs and visual binaries have the largest separation and longest orbital periods, which can be up to several million years. Eclipsing and spectroscopic binaries generally have the smallest separation, and their orbital periods can be as short as a few hours. Binaries with non- MAIN - SEQUENCE components, such as WHITE DW ARFS , NEUTRON STARS or BLACK HOLES , can have orbital periods of as little as a few minutes, although these systems are short-lived, with lifetimes less than about 10 million years. By convention, systems with orbital periods of less than 30 years are termed close binaries because the short orbital period implies separation of less than about 10 AU (the distance of Saturn from the Sun). Stars that remain within their own R OCHE LOBES are termed DETACHED BINARIES , while SEMIDETACHED BINARIES have one star (often a red giant) filling its Roche lobe. In semidetached binaries, material can spill from the lobe-filling star through the first LAGRANGIAN POINT on to its companion, often by transfer via an A CCRETION DISK . This MASS TRANSFER has considerable effect on the evolution of the two components. If both stars fill their Roche lobes, they are termed CONTACT BINARIES , and if material has escaped from the lobes to surround both stars, the system is known as a common envelope binary. The first visual binary star was discovered by Joannes Baptista RICCIOLI in 1650, when he observed MIZAR and saw that the star was actually double, with a separation of 14 \u0001 (this was distinct from the known companion ALCOR ). Small numbers of binaries were accidentally found by telescopic observers in the course of the next century, but it was not until 1767 that John MICHELL argued that stars appearing close together really were connected ‘under the influence of some general law’. The observational proof of Michell’s theory did not appear until 1804. William HERSCHEL had originally set out to determine the parallactic shift of the brighter (and, there- fore, closer) member of an unequal pair of stars with respect to the fainter component. But for many stars, par- ticularly CASTOR , the motion of the companion with respect to the primary star could be explained only if the two stars were regarded as physically connected, rotating around a common centre of gravity. Later observations showed that the apparent motion of the companion described an arc of an ellipse. In 1827 the French astronomer Félix Savary (1797–1841) was the first to calculate an orbit that would predict the motion of the companion star with respect to the primary. An important consequence of this was that the masses of the two stars were directly obtainable from elements of the true orbit. What is actually observed, the apparent orbit, is the projection of the true orbit on to the plane of the sky. The seven elements needed to define the size, shape and orien- tation of the true orbit are calculated from observations of POSITION ANGLE and separation ( see ORBITAL ELEMENTS ). The position angle is the angle that the line between the stars makes with the north point, and the separation is the angular distance between the two stars in arcseconds. By plotting position angle and separation from measurements made at different times the apparent orbit can be drawn. From the elements of the true orbit, the size of the semi- major axis ( a ) and the period of revolution ( P y ears) will allow the sum of the masses of the two stars to be calculat- ed, provided that the parallax of the binary is known. The relation connecting these quantities is (from Kepler’s third law): where M 1 and M 2 are in terms of the Sun’s mass and G is the gravitational constant. 4 \u0002 2 a 3 M 1 + M 2 = ––––– GP 2 B binary star 54 \u0001 binary star The two components of a binary system move in elliptical orbits around their common centre of gravity (G), which is not half way between them but nearer to the more massive component. In accordance with Kepler’s second law of motion, they do not travel at uniform rates. In (2) they are greatly separated and moving slowly. In (6) they are closer and moving more rapidly. 123 456 G G G G G G B AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 10:29 am Page 54"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"In order to derive individual masses, another relation between M 1 and M 2 is needed. This can be obtained by plotting the position of each star against the background of fainter, relatively fixed stars in the same field. The two stars will both appear to describe ellipses, which vary only in size depending on the mass of each star, thus: where a 1 and a 2 are the semimajor axes of the apparent ellipses described by the two stars. This process is a very time-consuming job, requiring measurements of hun- dreds of images obtained over many years. It has only been carried out for a few systems. The determination of masses from spectroscopic bina- r ies is more difficult than for visual binaries because it is not possible to determine the inclination of the apparent orbit unless eclipses occur. The best that can be done is to assume that the inclination is 90 ̊ and to calculate from this the minimum values that the masses are likely to take.

A star’s energy is the binding energy that is released as hydrogen is built up to helium, carbon, o xygen, and so on. That process, however, stops at iron, for which the binding energy per nucleon is a maximum; b uilding up heavier nuclei requires more energy than is released by the reaction. The consequent formation of an inert iron core in massive stars leads directly to type II SUPERNOVA explosions.

Modern binoculars are usually refracting telescopes with fixed eyepieces and a set of built-in prisms to provide an upright, right-reading view ( see PORRO PRISM ). Binoculars are normally described by two numbers, for example, 7 \u0001 50. The first number is the MAGNIFICATION , and the second number is the APERTURE in millimetres. Conve- niently, the EXIT PUPIL in millimetres is calculated by dividing the second number by the first (about 7 mm in this example). Tr ue binocular vision, where both eyes are used to form a stereoscopic view and gauge the distance to an object, is not effective when observing celestial objects. The distance from the objective lenses to the object is far too great compared with the distance between the lenses. However, apparent brightness and resolution are each improved when both eyes are used. biosphere Shallow region over the surface of a planet that supports life. Earth’s biosphere includes the land to about 8 km (5 mi) above mean sea level, the oceans to depths of at least 3.5 km (2 mi) and the atmosphere to a height of about 10 km (6 mi): in total, it is less than 20 km (12 mi) thick. Recently discovered microbial organisms called extremophiles ( see LIFE IN THE UNI - VERSE ) occupy a secondary subsurface biosphere that is believed to extend to 4 km (2.5 mi) beneath the surface of the continental crust and 7 km (4.3 mi) below the seafloor. Specific habitats within a biosphere are known as biomes . Only Earth is known to possess a surface and a subsurface biosphere. Mars, Europa and Titan are tar- gets for future space missions that will search for extrater- restrial subsurface biospheres, and in Titan’s case, perhaps a surface biosphere as well.

He demonstrated the extraterres- trial origin of meteorites, after investigating the meteorite shower at L’Aigle, France, on 1803 April 26. The follow- ing year he accompanied the chemist Joseph-Louis Gay- Lussac on a balloon flight, to an altitude of 4000 m (13,000 ft), in order to collect scientific data about the upper atmosphere. bipolar flow Non-spherical flow of material from a star. Occasionally stars lose matter at copious rates, for exam- ple at the end of their protostellar lives, and during their RED GIANT phases. If these flows are organized into two oppositely directed streams, they are called ‘bipolar’. This phenomenon is responsible for the creation of the rapidly moving HERBIG - HARO OBJECTS , flying away from the pre- cursors of TTA URI STARS . Very narrow, highly confined radio-emitting JETS characterize this youthful phase; these jets disturb the surrounding dark clouds and sweep up larger volumes of much slower molecular gas, also bipolar in pattern. For older stars the outflows may lead to bi- polar PLANETARY NEBULAE . Usually the stars that generate bipolar flows are sur- rounded by extensive, flattened, dusty envelopes – huge toroids – orientated perpendicular to the star’s rotation axis. The interplay of stellar rotation and mass outflow is believed to create the bipolar outflows. Binarity of the dri- ving star is implicated in at least some flows, as also may be magnetic fields. Birr Castle astronomy Astronomy practised at Birr Castle, near Birr, County Offaly (formerly Parsonstown, King’s County) in Ireland, with the ‘Leviathan of Parson- stown’, a 72-inch (1.8-m) telescope completed by William Pa r sons, Third Earl of R OSSE , in 1845. Using local work- men whom he trained, Rosse cast mirrors of speculum metal (a highly reflective copper–tin alloy) and construct- ed first a 36-inch (0.9-m) reflecting telescope. Later came the 72-inch, which remained the largest in the world until 1917, when Mount Wilson Observatory’s 100-inch (2.5- m) Hooker Telescope went into service. The Leviathan’s 72-inch mirror had a focal length of 54 ft (16.5 m), and the instrument was suspended between two walls 56 ft (17.1 m) high. It could not be effectively driven, and was unsuitable for photography. Despite these drawbacks, the telescope’s great size enabled Rosse to discern the spiral structure of certain nebulae which are now known to be galaxies, most notably the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51), which he sketched. Birr became an astronomical centre, and Rosse himself became a skilful observer, making his results freely available. After his death in 1867, his son Lau- rence Parsons, later the Fourth Earl, took over the obser- va tory. J.L.E. DREYER w as assistant at Birr between 1874 and 1878, during which period he accumulated much of the information that was to be later published in his NEW GENERAL CATALOGUE . From 1900 activity gradually decreased; the Fourth Earl died in 1908, and the 72-inch was dismantled. In 1916 the last Birr astronomer, Otto Boeddicker (1853–1937), departed, and work ceased. In 1996–98 the 72-inch telescope was restored to working order with a new glass mirror.

Thus an object that absorbs with 100% efficiency over the whole spectrum, known as a black body, will also be the most efficient when it comes to emitting radiation. A good practical approximation to a black body is a small hole in the side of an otherwise closed box. The emission from a black body, known as black body radiation, is a good fit to the emission from many astro- nomical objects, including stars and interstellar dust clouds (spectrum lines are mostly minor deviations from the overall emission). Black body radiation follows a bell- shaped distribution given by the PLANCK DISTRIBUTION . The peak of the distribution shifts to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases ( see WIEN ’ SLAW ). This leads to the common experience that at moderate tempera- tures objects glow a dull red, then change colour succes- sively through bright red, yellow, white to blue-white as the temperature is increased. The total emitted energy increases rapidly with temperature, leading to the STE - FAN – BOLTZMANN LAW . black drop Optical effect observed during the initial (ingress) and final (egress) stages of a TRANSIT of MER - CURY or VENUS . Once the planet is fully projected on the Sun at ingress, but before its trailing edge breaks apparent contact with the solar limb, the expectation is of instanta- neous separation. Instead, the planet seems to lengthen, with a dusky ligament appearing briefly to link it to the Sun’s limb. This effect is the black drop, which may be likened to a drop of water before it falls from a tap. It is again seen at egress as the planet’s leading edge approach- es the opposite limb. The effect may be physiological in origin, but it has also been attributed to atmospheric tur- bulence and to instrument defects. black dwarf Ultimate state of a WHITE DWARF star. A white dwarf does not have a means of maintaining its heat, and it therefore cools steadily. Given long enough, it cools to invisibility, and is then called a black dwarf. Such objects are hypothetical: none have been observed, and it is doubtful whether our Galaxy is old enough for any to have cooled sufficiently to enter this state.

It has a prominent lane of dark material close to its nucleus. The galaxy was originally discovered by J.E. BODE in 1779. It has apparent dimensions of 9 \u0002 .2 \u0003 4 \u0002 .6 and magnitude \u0001 8.5. The Black Eye Galaxy’s true diame- ter is 65,000 l.y., and it lies 24 million l.y. away. black hole Object that is so dense and has a gravitational field so strong that not even light or any other kind of radi- ation can escape: its escape velocity exceeds the speed of light. Black holes are predicted by Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY , which shows that if a quantity of matter is compressed within a critical radius, no signal can ever escape from it. Thus, although there are many black hole candidates, they cannot be observed directly. Candi- dates are inferred from the effects they have upon nearby matter. There are three classes of black hole: stellar, pri- mordial (or mini) and supermassive. A stellar black hole is a region of space into which a star (or collection of stars or other bodies) has collapsed. This can happen after a star massive enough to have a remnant core of more than 2.3 solar masses (the Lan- dau–Oppenheimer–Volkov limit for NEUTRON STARS ) reaches the end of its thermonuclear life. It collapses to a critical size, overcoming both electron and neutron degen- eracy pressure, whereupon gravity overwhelms all other forces ( see DEGENERATE MATTER ). Primordial black holes , proposed by Stephen HAWK - ING , could have been created at the time of the BIG BANG , when some regions might have got so compressed that they underwent gravitational collapse. With original mass- es comparable to that of Earth or less, these mini-black holes could be of the order of 1 cm (about half an inch) or smaller. In such small black holes, quantum effects become very important ( see QU ANTUM THEORY ). It is pos- sible to show that such a black hole is not completely black, but that radiation can ‘tunnel out’ of the event hori- zon at a steady rate; such radiation is known as HAWKING RADIATION . This then could lead to the evaporation of the hole. Primordial black holes could thus be very hot, and from the outside they could look like WHITE HOLES , the time-reversals of black holes. It seems that supermassive black holes of the order of 100 million solar masses lie at the centres of ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI , extreme examples of which are QU ASARS . It is thought there may also be supermassive black holes at the centres of ordinary galaxies like the Milky Way. The lifetime of a black hole can be shown to be propor- tional to the cube of its mass. For black holes of stellar mass, their potential lifetime is of the order of 10 67 years. Many primordial black holes will have evaporated away completely by now. There are various different models of black holes. The most straightforward is that of the Schwarzschild black hole, a non-rotating black hole that has no charge. In nature, however, it is expected that black holes do rotate but have little charge, so the model of a rotating Kerr black hole with no charge is probably the most applicable. A Kerr–Newman black hole is rotating and has a charge. A Reissner–Nordström black hole is a non-rotating black hole with a charge. The radius of a non-rotating Schwarzschild black hole of mass M is given by 2 GM / c 2 , where G is the gravita- tional constant and c is the speed of light. When a star becomes smaller than this SCHWARZSCHILD RADIUS , grav- ity completely dominates all other forces. The Schwarz- schild radius determines the location of the surface of the black hole, called the EVENT HORIZON . Only the region on and outside the event horizon is relevant to the exter- nal observer; events inside the event horizon can never influence the exterior. There is no lower limit to the B black drop 56 \u0001 Black Eye Galaxy The prominent dust lane that gives the Sb-type spiral galaxy M64 its name is just detectable with large amateur instruments. Larger instruments or image processing are needed to resolve the outer spiral arms. B AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 10:29 am Page 56"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"radius of a black hole. Some of the primordial black holes could be truly microscopic. When a stellar black hole first forms, its event horizon may have a grotesque shape and be rapidly vibrating. With- in a fraction of a second, however, the horizon settles down to a unique smooth shape. A Kerr black hole has an event horizon that is flattened at the poles rather than circular (just as rotation flattens the Earth at its poles). What hap- pens to matter after it crosses the event horizon depends on whether or not the star is rotating. In the case of a collapsing b ut non-rotating star that is spherically symmetric, the mat- ter is crushed to zero volume and infinite density at the SIN - GULARITY , which is located at the centre of the hole. Infinitely strong gravitational forces deform and squeeze matter out of existence at the singularity, which is a region where physical theory breaks down. In a rotating Kerr black hole, however, the singularity need not be encountered. Rotating black holes have fascinating implications for hypo- thetical space travel to other universes. The density of matter in a star as it crosses the critical event horizon need not necessarily be very high: its densi- ty could even be less than that of water. This is because the density of any body is proportional to its mass divided by its radius cubed, and the radius of a black hole is, as we have seen, proportional to its mass. These two facts com- bined imply that the density at which a black hole is formed is inversely proportional to the square of the mass. T ake a supermassive black hole with a mass of from 10,000 to 100 million solar masses – the mass of a black hole that might be found at the centre of certain active galaxies. Such a collapsing mass would reach the black hole stage when its average density was roughly that of wa ter. If the mass of the collapsing sphere were that of an entire galaxy, the average density of matter crossing the event horizon would be less than that of air. Attempts to discover stellar black holes must rely on the influence of their gravitational fields on nearby matter, and/or their influences on the propagation of radiation in the vicinity of the hole. Black holes within BINARY STAR sys- tems are potentially the easiest to detect because of the influence on their companion. Material is pulled from the companion into the black hole via an A CCRETION DISK . The frictional heating within the disk leads to the emission of X- rays ( see X - RAY BINARY ). The first candidate where one companion in a binary system is thought to be a black hole is the X-ray source CYGNUS X -1. At the position of this X- ray source lies a SPECTROSCOPIC BINARY star HDE 226868, which has a period of 5.6 days. More recently, all-sky mon- itors on space-borne X-ray observatories have discovered soft X-ray transients (SXTs); objects that produce rare, dramatic X-ray outbursts (typically separated by decades). Around 75% of SXTs contain black hole candidates. The existence of supermassive black holes in quasars and as the central sources in active galactic nuclei is gener- ally accepted as the means of explaining the phenomena observed. Many ordinary galaxies like our own show enhanced brightening at their cores, along with anom- alously high velocities of objects near the centre, suggest- ing the existence of a black hole. There is also the MISSING MASS PROBLEM : the density of the observable matter in our Universe is much less than the theoretically computed value needed to ‘close’ the Universe ( see CLOSED UNIVERSE ), and it may be that at least some is in the form of black holes.

The blazars are the most active of the galaxies with active nuclei, that is, the galaxies whose central regions are undergoing energetic processes that turn them into SEYFERT GALAXIES , BL Lacertae objects or quasars. The blazars show variable optical brightness, strong and variable optical polarization and strong radio emission. The variations in the optical region may be on timescales as short as days. Much of the activity in A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI is relat- ed to JETS of gas expelled from their central regions with rel- a tivistic velocities. The most probable explanation for the exceptional activity in blazars is that with these galaxies we are viewing jets directed straight towards us. Blazhko effect Pe r iodic change in the light-curves and periods of some RR LYRAE VARIABLE STARS ; it was discov- ered by Sergei Nikolaevich Blazhko (1870–1956). The most likely cause is pulsation in two modes simultaneous- ly, although certain stars appear to be ‘oblique rotators’, that is, stars in which the magnetic axis does not corre- spond to the rotational axis. Blaze Star P opular name for the T Coronae Borealis, the brightest known RECURRENT NOVA . Normally around 11th magnitude, it has flared up to naked-eye brightness on two occasions, once in 1866 when it reached 2nd mag. and again in 1946 when it peaked at 3rd mag. T Coronae Borealis is a spectroscopic binary in which an M3 red g iant orbits with a white dwarf every 227.5 days; gas falling from the red giant on to the companion causes the outbursts. A possible additional periodicity of 56.7 days may be caused by a third component. blink comparator (blink microscope) Instrument that enables two photographs of the same area of sky, taken at different times, to be rapidly alternated to compare them. Any object that has changed position or brightness during the photograph intervals will show up. The comparator has two optical paths so that the two photographs can be seen together in one viewing eyepiece. By careful adjustment, the separate images are brought into exact coincidence and then alternately illuminated, chang- ing from one to the other about once a second. All features that are identical appear unchanged, but any object that is on only one of the photographs is seen to blink on and off. An object that has changed its position between the times the photographs were taken appears to jump to and fro and an object that has changed in brightness is seen to pulsate. The eye is very efficient at detecting the few varying objects among what can be tens of thousands of star images. This simple technique makes possible the discov- ery of stars of large proper motion, minor planets, comets or variable stars, without the need individually to compare every star image on two photographs. These days blink comparators are particularly used by hunters of novae and asteroids but past examples of their w ork include: the discovery of PLUTO by Clyde T OMBAUGH ; the catalogue of over 100,000 stars brighter than magnitude 14.5 with detectable proper motion, pro- duced by W.J.

BL Lacertae object Category of luminous A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS , the defining characteristics of which include very weak or unobservable emission lines and rapid variability. The prototype, BL Lacertae itself, was long listed as a variable star until its extragalactic nature became apparent from observations of the faint sur- rounding galaxy. When the objects’ continuum light is faintest, weak emission lines similar to those of quasars may be detected, and their bright cores often have exten- sive haloes at radio wavelengths as well. These properties are well explained by a picture in which BL Lacertae objects are QU ASISTELLAR OBJECTS (QSOs) or RADIO GALAXIES seen almost along the line of a relativistic JET , so that the radiation seen from the jet is Doppler boosted in frequency and intensity. This geometry also amplifies small changes in the velocity or direction of the jet, accounting for the strong variability of these objects, and fitting with the fact that many of them have small-scale radio jets showing superluminal motion. A few BL Lac- ertae objects have been detected at the highest photon energies, 1 TeV; this implies that their radiation is being beamed into a small angle (as in gamma-ray bursts), oth- erwise it would be lost to pair production within the source.

Blooming also refers to the loss of focus of a cam- era sensor because of excessive brightness and the term may occasionally have this meaning in astronomy. blue moon Occasional blue colour of the Moon, due to effects in the Earth’s atmosphere. It can be caused by dust particles, from volcanoes or forest fires, high in the upper a tmosphere, which scatter light, making it appear blue. The expression sometimes refers to the occurrence of a second full moon in a calendar month, something which occurs about seven times every 19 years, and it is used in everyday speech to denote a rare event. blue straggler In a GLOBULAR CLUSTER , star that appears to be younger than the others because it still lies on the MAIN SEQUENCE after the majority of other cluster members have evolved off. It is observed to be on the main sequence beyond the TURNOFF POINT : it is bluer in spectral terms than the stars at the turnoff point. Being y ounger and more massive than the other stars in the clus- ter poses a problem as to the blue stragglers’ origin. They are thought to be either stars in close binaries that have been rejuvenated by mass transfer from their companions, or stars that were produced by a stellar collision. The Hubble Space Telescope has imaged many blue stragglers situated in the cores of globular clusters. They have also been found in OPEN CLUSTERS and in the DW ARF GALAXY companions to the Milky Way.

He did much to popularize astronomy, founding the highly regarded Astronomisches Jahrbuch in 1774, which he edited for over half a century. In 1801 he published Uranographia , the most beautiful star AT LAS ever drawn, with a catalogue of ov er 17,000 stars and non-stellar objects. Bode’s name is most famously associated with the empirical relationship between planetary distances known as BODE ’ SLAW , though he did not in fact discover it. Bode’s law (Titius–Bode law) Simple numerical rela- tionship, first noticed by Johann Titius of Wittenberg, but popularized by Johann Elert BODE in 1772, which match- es the distances of the then known planets from the Sun. The formula is produced by taking the numbers 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96 and 192 (all, apart from the first two, being double their predecessor) and then adding four, giving the sequence 4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, 196. If the distance of the Earth from the Sun is then taken to be 10, it is found that Mercury falls into place at 3.9, Venus at 7.2, Mars at 15.2, Jupiter at 52.0 and Saturn at 95.4. The dis- covery of Uranus at 191.8, by Sir William Herschel in 1781, initiated a hunt for the missing planet between Mars and Jupiter at 28. This led to the discovery in 1801 of the first minor planet, Ceres, and subsequently the ASTEROID BELT . Neptune, at 300.7, does not fit the sequence although Pluto, at 394.6, does. The relationship is now widely regarded simply as a mathematical curiosi- ty, rather than indicating anything significant about the physical properties of the Solar System. Bok, Bartholomeus Jan (‘Bart’) (1906–83) Dutch- American astronomer best known for his studies of the Milky Way and his discovery of BOK GLOBULES . At Har- v ard University (1929–57), Bok worked closely with his wife, Priscilla Fairfield Bok (1896–1975), to map the spiral arms of our Galaxy by ‘star-counting’ methods. In the course of this work, the two astronomers made highly detailed studies of the Carina region from Harvard’s southern station in South Africa. During his tenure at Harvard, Bok was an early advocate of radio astronomy research, and he was instrumental in setting up Mexico’s National Observatory at Tonantzintla. At Mount Stromlo (Australia) Observatory (1957–66), where he was direc- tor, they carried out similar surveys for the Magellanic Clouds. He was especially interested in the Galaxy’s many different kinds of gas and dust clouds, and he was the first to identify the opaque, cool (10 K), tiny (0.6–2 l.y.) condensations of gas and dust now named after him that give rise to low-mass stars. The Boks wrote the classic book The Milky Way , which had run through five editions as of 1981.

Bolton, John Gatenby (1922–93) English scientist who spent much of his career in Australia as a pioneer of radio astronomy. Bolton used a radio interferometer to identify the extraterrestrial radio sources Taurus A (the Crab Nebu- la), Centaurus A (the galaxy NGC 5128) and Virgo A (the galaxy M87). His team was the first to confirm that the centre of the Milky Way galaxy was a strong source of radio emission, which they called Sagittarius A. Bolton founded CalTech’s Owens Valley Radio Observatory in the 1950s and later directed Australia’s Parkes Radio Observatory. Boltzmann constant (symbol k ) Constant defined as the universal gas constant ( R ) divided by Avogadro’s con- stant. It is the gas constant per particle and has a value of 1.38066 \u0001 10 \u0002 23 J/K. It is often encountered in equations relating the properties of gases to temperature, for example the gas pressure law, in the form P = nkT , where P is the pressure, n the number of particles per cubic metre, and T the temperature. It also occurs in BOLTZMANN ’ SE QU A TION . Boltzmann’s equation Equation, introduced by the Austrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann (1844–1906), that gi v es the relative populations of atoms with electrons in different levels of excitation: where N a and N b are the number densities of atoms in exci- tation levels a and b , g a and g b are constants for the levels called statistical weights, E a and E b are the excitation ener- g ies of the levels, k is BOLTZMANN ’ S CONSTANT and T is the temperature. The equation is used in understanding stellar spectra and processes occurring in stellar atmospheres. Bond, George Phillips (1825–65) American astronomer who in 1859 succeeded his father, William Cranch BOND , as director of the HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY . He made many contributions to the studies of double stars and stellar parallax. With his father, he discovered Sat- urn’s Crepe Ring (the C Ring) and its eighth satellite, Hyperion, independently of William LASSELL . Bond argued against the then-popular theory that Saturn’s rings w ere solid, having observed stars through the Crepe Ring. He used the new technique of photography (using ‘wet’ plates) to study the Moon and the planets and was the first to photograph a star, Vega, in 1850 and the first to image a double star, Mizar, in 1857. Bond, William Cranch (1789–1859) American astronomer who founded the HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVA - TORY and was its director from 1839, being succeeded by his son George Phillips BOND . A clock-maker by trade, he designed and built sophisticated chronometers for naviga- tion and astronomy. He transferred his own private obser- va tory to Harvard; Bond procured a 15-inch (380-mm) refracting telescope, then the largest in the world, for the observatory. With this, he and his son discovered Saturn’s satellite Hyperion in 1848, and the planet’s semitransparent Crepe Ring (the C Ring) in 1850. Bond also made detailed studies of sunspots and the Orion Nebula (M42). Bondi, Hermann (1919– ) British cosmologist and mathematician, born in Austria, who co-originated the STEADY - STATE THEORY of cosmology. After working for the British Admiralty during World War II, Bondi was appointed professor of applied mathematics at King’s Col- lege, London in 1954. In 1948, with Fred HOYLE and Thomas GOLD , he constructed a new cosmological theory calling for the ‘continuous creation’ of matter at the rate of 10 \u0002 10 nucleons per cubic metre per year. This process, explained Bondi, allowed the Universe to maintain a con- stant average density of matter that counterbalanced flat space expanding at a constant rate. The discovery in 1964 of the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND cast serious doubt on the validity of the steady-state theory, which has since been abandoned in its original form. The work of Bondi and Hoyle on stellar structure, especially of the formation of heavier elements inside stars, was a valuable by-product of this theory. Bondi later demonstrated that gravitational wa v es are real, and not just theoretical, consequences of Einstein’s general theory of relativity, and his work has defined the physical properties of these phenomena.

Boss, Lewis (1846–1912) American astronomer who in 1895 began an ambitious programme to measure star positions and magnitudes with unprecedented accuracy, culminating in two important star catalogues, the Prelimi- nary General Catalogue of 6 , 188 Stars (1910) and the Gen- eral Catalogue of 33 , 342 Stars (1937), the latter work completed decades after his death by his son Benjamin Boss (1880–1970). Boss observed the stars visible from Earth’s northern hemisphere from New York’s Dudley Observatory, where he became director in 1876, and the southern stars from Argentina. Bowditch, Nathaniel (1773–1838) Self-educated American scientist, author and translator of Laplace’s massive Tr aité de mécanique céleste (1829–39). Bowditch made many observations of meteors, comets and the Moon, which he wrote up between 1804 and 1820 – some of the first publications based upon original astronomical observations to appear in America. Bowen, Edward George (1911–91) Welsh scientist who used radar and other equipment salvaged at the end of W orld War II to help found Australian radio astronomy. He played a key role in the design and construction of the P arkes Radio Observatory’s 64-m (210-ft) radio telescope, which was used for several important surveys of radio sources. Bowen pioneered the use of radio telescopes to detect the radio-wavelength echoes produced by meteors. Bowen, Ira Sprague (1898–1973) American astrophysi- cist who in 1927 showed that previously unidentified lines in the spectra of nebulae were due not to a new element, ‘nebulium’, but to so-called FORBIDDEN LINES of ionized o xygen and nitrogen. As long-time director of the Mount Wilson and Palomar Observatories (1946–64), Bowen ov ersaw the construction of the 200-inch (5-m) Hale Tele- scope and the 48-inch (1.2-m) Oschin Schmidt telescope used to make the P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY SKY SURVEY . bow shock Sharp boundary standing in the SOLAR WIND flow upstream of a planetary MAGNETOSPHERE or other obstacle, such as a cometary or planetary IONOSPHERE . The flow of the solar wind is supersonic and indeed faster than the various characteristic speeds associated with the magnetic field and plasmas of which it is constituted. As a consequence, information that the solar wind is approach- ing a planetary magnetosphere is unable to propagate upstream into the flow, and a curved standing shock wave is formed. At this shock, the solar wind plasma is rapidly decelerated and deflected around the magnetosphere; the upstream flow kinetic energy is converted into plasma heating. Thus a region of hot, slow-flowing, turbulent solar wind plasma and magnetic field appears down- stream in the planet’s magnetosheath (the region between the bow shock and the MAGNETOPAUSE ). Since the solar wind plasma is collisionless, it was origi- nally assumed that a classical bow shock wave could not form. However, the magnetic field imparts a collective behaviour to the plasma, which thus acts in much the same way as do molecules in a classical gas. The magnetic field, therefore, has a strong influence on the structure of the bow shock. A quasi-perpendicular bow shock, in which the magnetic field points mostly at right angles to the shock surface normal, tends to be a very abrupt boundary. A quasi-parallel bow shock, in which the mag- netic field is closely parallel to the shock surface normal, allows any very energetic particles to escape back into the upstream solar wind; it is thus a more diffuse boundary. Bow shocks and shock waves in general are efficient accel- erators of particles, and they may be responsible for ener- g ization processes around planetary magnetospheres and indeed in many wider astronomical phenomena.

It was the first instrument in the w orld to provide remote access via the Internet, princi- pally for education. Bradley, James (1693–1762) English astronomer and clergyman, Savilian professor of astronomy at Oxford and, later, at Greenwich Observatory. In 1742 he suc- ceeded Edmond HALLEY , becoming the third ASTRONOMER ROYAL . While searching for stellar parallax, by making meticulous measurements of the star \u0006 Draco- nis, Bradley discovered the ABERRATION of starlight in 1728; this was the first direct observational evidence of the Earth’s orbital motion, confirming the Copernican model of the Solar System. His value for this constant was 20 \u0007 .5, the modern value being taken as 20 \u0007 .47. Bradley calculat- ed the time it takes sunlight to reach the Earth as 8 min- utes 12 seconds, just 7 seconds shorter than the currently accepted value. From observations covering a complete revolution of the nodes of the Moon’s orbit (1727–48), he found a periodic nodding or NUTATION of the Earth’s axis. At Greenwich, Bradley catalogued the positions of thou- sands of stars – because he took into account the effects of aberration and nutation, his catalogues contained more accurate stellar positions than those of his predecessors. He also made accurate measurements of Jupiter’s diame- ter and carefully observed the eclipses and other phenom- ena of its satellites. Brahe, Tycho (1546–1601) Danish astronomer who used pre-telescopic instruments of his own design to obtain planetary and star positions of unprecedented accuracy, later used by his assistant Johannes KEPLER to derive his three fundamental laws of planetary motions. T ycho was born into a noble family, his father Otto Brahe serving as a privy councillor and governor at Hels- ingborg, Denmark (now in Sweden). He was raised by B Borrelly, Comet 19P/ 60 B AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 10:29 am Page 60"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"his uncle, Jörgen Brahe, who left him a substantial inher- itance. As a thirteen-year-old boy, Tycho was greatly impressed by astronomers’ accurate prediction of the total solar eclipse of 1560 August 21. From 1559 to 1570, he attended the universities at Copenhagen, Leipzig, Wittenberg, Rostock and Basel, studying law and the humanities but maintaining a strong interest in astronomy. In 1566 Tycho duelled with a rival student, losing the tip of his nose, which he covered for the rest of his life with a metal prosthesis. During this period, his teachers helped him make astronomical globes and sim- ple cross-staffs, forerunners of the more sophisticated instruments he would later use, and he read Ptolemy’s Almagest , the only astronomy book then available. In 1563 August, Tycho had observed a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn, noticing that the Copernican tables w ere grossly in error (by several days) in predicting this event. He decided to devote the rest of his life to improving planetary and stellar positions, acquiring a large quadrant and building a private observatory at Skåne in 1571. The next year, Tycho independently discovered a supernova in Cassiopeia, and his report, De stella nova (1573), made him famous. The Danish king, Frederick II, gave him the Baltic island of Hveen in 1576, where Tycho built two observato- r ies, URANIBORG and STJERNEBORG , carrying out 20 years’ wo r th of very accurate observations with instruments such as the 6 \u0001 \u0002 -ft (2-m) mural quadrant. He described these instruments and his work at Hveen in two magnificent books, Astronomiae instauratae mechanica (1598) and Astronomiae instauratae progymnasmata (1602). Whereas previous astronomers had contented them- selves with observing the planets at opposition and quad- rature, Tycho obtained positions at many intermediate points in their orbits, accurate to 30 \u0001 – the best previous planetary positions were accurate only to 15 \u0002 . He was the first astronomer to take atmospheric refraction into account in correcting observed planetary and stellar posi- tions. Tycho made the first truly scientific studies of comets, observing the position, magnitude, colour and orientation of the tail of the Great Comet of 1577. These observations led him to conclude that the comet’s orbit, which he determined must have an elongated shape, lay beyond the Moon – a novel idea at the time. Tycho’s care- ful measurements of the Sun’s apparent movement allowed him to determine the length of a year to within 1 second, forcing 10 days to be dropped from the Julian cal- endar in 1582 after it was shown that the Julian year exceeded the ‘true’ year by this amount of time. He also compiled a catalogue of 777 stars. T ycho was not a Copernican, but created a TYCHON - IAN SYSTEM with the planets revolving around the Sun, and the Sun and Moon revolving around a fixed Earth. This model was widely accepted by many astronomers until the mid-17th century. His observations of the comet of 1577, which demonstrated that it moved among the planets, defeated the Aristotelian notion that the planets were contained within solid crystalline spheres through which a body like the comet could not possibly move. Tycho ended his days as Imperial Mathe- matician under the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, where Kepler was one of his assistants. Kepler later reduced much of Tycho’s data (which appeared in the Rudolphine Tables of 1627) to discover the three fun- damental laws of planetary motion (1609–19). Brahmagupta (598– c .670) Indian astronomer and author of the Bra ̄ hmasphutasiddha ̄nta (‘The Opening of the Universe’), a scholarly discussion of algebra, geometry and astronomy in verse form.

It was proposed by Princeton physicists C.H. Brans and R.H. Dicke in 1961. Based on the ideas of Ernst Mach about reference frames being connected to the distribution of matter in the Universe, Brans and Dicke modified GENERAL RELA - TIVITY , introducing a scalar field, to include Mach’s pro- posal. The strength of this field is governed by an arbitrary constant w , but experiments limited the Brans–Dicke parameter w to values closer and closer to one, at which the Brans–Dicke theory became indistin- guishable from general relativity. Brashear, John Alfred (1840–1920) American tele- scope-maker who founded a renowned optical company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, named after himself, today known as Contraves Corp. Brashear made the 30-inch (0.76-m) Thaw refracting telescope for Pittsburgh’s Allegheny Observatory. Besides telescopes, Brashear’s firm made spectroscopes, prisms and gratings and other highly specialized astronomical equipment, including George Ellery HALE ’s spectroheliograph.

At the close of World War II, von Braun and many other German rocket scientists were relocated first to White Sands (New Mexico) Proving Grounds, then to Huntsville, Alabama. At White Sands, the V-2s were put to peaceful use in high-altitude atmospheric and astro- nomical research. At Huntsville, von Braun led teams that b uilt and launched the Jupiter and Redstone missiles and, on 1958 January 31, the USA’s first artificial satellite, Explorer 1.

The comet reached peak magnitude \u0001 6.5 in mid- August but was only observed over a short arc, leading to uncertainties as to its orbital period. The comet was rediscovered by Joel H. Metcalf on 1919 August 21, reaching magnitude \u0001 4.5 around perihelion on October 17. The comet next returned to perihelion, 0.48 AU from the Sun, on 1989 September 11, reaching magnitude \u0001 5, and proving a readily observable object during this apparition. Comet 23P/Brorsen–Metcalf appears to be subject to considerable NON - GRAVITATIONAL FORCE , which modifies the orbital parameters. The comet’s cur- rent period is 70.54 years. Brouwer, Dirk (1902–66) Dutch-born expert in celestial mechanics. He spent his career at Yale University, where he directed its observatory for a quarter-century and edit- ed the Astronomical Journal . He was among the first to use computers to perform the complex and laborious calcula- tions demanded by the methods of celestial mechanics that he developed for improving the orbital elements of planets, asteroids and comets. Brouwer extended these methods to calculate the orbits of the first artificial Earth satellites. Brown, Ernest William (1866–1938) English mathe- matician, a specialist in celestial mechanics, who moved to America in 1891. Working at Yale University, Brown con- structed tables of the Moon’s motion accurate to 0 \u0002 .01, based in part on a century and a half of observations made from England’s Greenwich Observatory. His advances in lunar theory showed that the Earth’s variable rotation rate explained much of the irregularity in the Moon’s movements. Brown also made major contribu- tions to our knowledge of the Trojan asteroids. Brown, Robert Hanbury (1916–2002) English astronomer, born in India, who in the 1950s applied his expertise in radar developed during World War II to the new science of radio astronomy. His major accomplish- ment was the invention of the intensity interferometer, with which he was able to measure the diameters of stars, something impossible with optical telescopes. Brown played a major role in conducting radio surveys of the sky from Jodrell Bank, and spent much of his later career at the University of Sydney. brown dwarf Star with mass greater than about 0.01 solar mass but less than 0.08 solar mass; its core tempera- ture does not rise high enough to start thermonuclear reactions. It is luminous, however, because it slowly shrinks in size and radiates away its gravitational energy. As its surface temperature is below the 2500 K lower limit for RED DWARFS , it is known as a brown dwarf. The first unambiguous detection and image of a brown dwarf, Gliese 229B (GL229B), was made in 1995. GL229B is a small companion to the cool red star Gliese 229, which is located 19 l.y. from Earth in the constellation of Lepus. It is estimated to be 20 to 50 times the mass of Jupiter. Infrared spectroscopic observations, made with the 200-inch (5-m) Hale telescope at Palomar, show that the brown dwarf has an abundance of methane, making it sim- ilar in composition to Jupiter and the other gas giant plan- ets in the Solar System. More than 100 brown dwarf candidates have since been discovered in infrared surveys, many of which are warmer than GL229B but cooler than M dwarf stars. A new class of L dwarf (see LSTAR ) has thus been added to the SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION system.

Brown dwarfs are far more abundant than previously thought, but they are probably not abundant enough to contribute signifi- cantly to the MISSING MASS . The HST survey also showed that many brown dwarfs are ‘free-floating’ isolated bodies rather than members of CLOSE BINARY systems, suggesting that they form in a manner similar to stars, not planets. However, some of the more massive EXTRASOLAR PLAN - ETS may well be brown dwarfs. Bruno, Giordano (1548–1600) Italian philosopher and monk. A sharp critic of the cosmology of Aristotle and an early supporter of Copernicus’ heliocentric theory, he was bu r ned at the stake in Rome for theological heresy and suspicion of magical practices. Bruno postulated a cos- mology in which the universe was infinite, as elucidated in his 1584 work De l’infinito universo e mondi . BS Abbreviation of BRIGHT STAR CATALOGUE B star Member of a class of blue-white stars, the spectra of which are characterized by neutral helium and strong h ydrogen lines. MAIN - SEQUENCE B dwarfs have a great range of stellar properties. Temperatures range from 10,000 K at B9.5 to 31,000 K at B0, zero-age masses from 2.3 to 14 solar masses, zero-age luminosities from 25 to 25,000 solar luminosities, and lifetimes from 800 mil- lion to 11 million years. B GIANTS and SUPERGIANTS have increasingly narrow hydrogen lines, from which the Mor- gan–Keenan class can be determined. Average dwarf rota- tion speeds maximize at B5 at over 250 km/s (160 mi/s). BE STARS are fast rotators surrounded by disks that radiate emission lines. Slower rotators can be CHEMICALLY PECU - LIAR STARS , appearing as MERCURY – MANGANESE STARS . AP STARS extend into the class as Bp. Because of their youth, B stars are found in the galactic disk and in regions of star formation. Temperatures at B0 and B1 are high enough to produce diffuse nebulae. Light scattered by dust from cooler B stars creates reflection nebulae. Along with OST ARS , B stars form loose, unbound OB ASSOCIATIONS . While rare (one for every 1000 or more stars), B stars are thousands of times more common than O stars, and help to outline the spiral arms of galaxies and to give them their bluish colours. O dwarfs evolve into B supergiants, some of which turn into luminous blue variables, which can have lumi- nosities up to two million times that of the Sun and mass loss rates up to a hundredth of a solar mass per year (Eta Carinae, for example). B dwarfs evolve into giants and may appear at some point as CEPHEID VARIABLES . Class B also contains the Beta Cephei variables, all giants or sub- g iants that pulsate with multiple periods of hours and amplitudes of a few hundredths of a magnitude. Bright examples of B stars include Achernar B5 IV, Regulus B7 V, Rigel B8la and Spica BI V. Bullialdus Magnificent lunar crater (21ºS 22ºW), diameter 63 km (39 mi), in the middle of Mare Nubium; it has massive 2500-m-high (8000-ft) terraced walls. A broad, bright ejecta blanket flanks the ramparts of Bullialdus, highlighting a system of gullies flowing down the crater’s outer slopes. The crater’s squared-off interior w alls contain many landslips. The floor features a complex group of central mountains, the highest reaching ov er 1000 m (3000 ft). Burbidge, Geoffrey Ronald (1925– ) and Burbidge, (Eleanor) Margaret (1919– ) English husband-and-wife astrophysicists noted for their studies of the NUCLEOSYN - THESIS of elements inside stars, investigations into A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI (AGN S ) and research in COSMOLOGY . W orking at Cambridge University, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of California at San Diego, Geoffrey Burbidge’s research has involved the physics of non-thermal radiation processes, quasars and other AGNs, and alternative cosmological models, includ- ing the ‘quasi-steady-state theory’. This model, unlike the original STEADY - STATE THEORY , explains the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND . It proposes that matter is creat- ed by a series of ‘mini Big Bangs’ at a rate of 10 16 solar masses on timescales of duration c .1/H 0 (the Hubble time). Burbidge’s cosmology suggests that the isotope 4 He is produced, not by the traditional Big Bang, but by stellar h ydrogen burning, as are other ‘light’ isotopes, up to 11 B. He has also directed Kitt Peak National Observatory. Margaret Burbidge has worked at most of the same institutions as her husband, and has served as director of Royal Greenwich Observatory (1972–73). In much of her w ork she has applied spectroscopy to determine the mass- es and rotation rates of galaxies. In 1957 she, her husband, William FOWLER and Fred HOYLE published a seminal paper in which they set forth the basic processes that gov- ern stellar nucleosynthesis. Their theory (known from the initials of its proponents as the B 2 FH theory) explained that younger stars convert their abundant supplies of h ydrogen into helium and light, and as they age, the heli- um is gradually burned into carbon, oxygen and other chemical elements. Heavier nuclei are formed when the carbon and oxygen atoms combine with protons or He nuclei – Mg, Si, S, Ar and Ca can be synthesized this way. The Burbidges have made extensive investigations of quasars and AGNs, finding that the two often coincide. They concluded that AGNs emit enormous amounts of energy from relatively confined regions, and suggested that BLACK HOLES are the power source. Margaret Bur- bidge also helped develop the Faint Object Spectrograph for the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE , which she has used to study the ultraviolet flux of AGNs. Burnham, Sherburne Wesley (1838–1921) American observer and cataloguer of double stars who worked at Lick Observatory (1888–92) and Yerkes Observatory (1894–1914), discovering over a thousand new pairs. Burnham was able to use the largest refracting telescopes of the day, including Lick’s 36-inch (0.9-m) and Yerkes’ 40-inch (1-m). His life’s work culminated in the publica- tion of the massive two-volume General Catalogue of Dou- ble Stars Within 121 Degrees of the North Pole , which contained data for over 13,000 doubles.

Their numbers increase and their latitude distribution moves toward the equator as the cycle progresses. This graphical represen- tation of sunspot latitudes against dates of observation was first plotted by the English astronomer Edward Walter MAUNDER in the early 20th century.

The changes arise from axial rotation of stars with markedly non-uniform surface luminosity, caused by large ‘starspots’ and chromospheric activity. The spots are larger than those on the Sun (covering up to 20% of the stellar surface) and have little or no penumbra. Periods range from a fraction of a day to about 120 days. A number (approximately 20) of these red dwarf stars also exhibit flare activity, in which case they are classed as FLARE STARS .

Caldwell Catalogue Listing of 109 deep-sky objects intended to complement those in the MESSIER CATA - LOGUE . Charles Messier omitted from his list several prominent objects, such as the Double Cluster in Pe r seus, and southern-hemisphere objects of which he w as unaware. In 1993 English amateur astronomer Pa trick MOORE , recognizing these omissions, gathered a further 109 deep-sky objects in a catalogue that takes its title from one of his middle names. The list enjoys some popularity among amateur observers who have observed all the Messier objects and are seeking further targets. See table, pages 66–67 calendar System for measuring longer intervals of time by dividing it into periods of days, weeks, months and y ears. The length of the day is based on the average rota- tion period of the Earth, while a year is based on the orbital period of the Earth around the Sun. The MONTH w as originally the period between suc- cessive full moons (29.5 days), giving a lunar year of 354 days, but in modern calendars it is now roughly one twelfth of a year. Because there are not a whole number of full moons in a year, the two cannot be simply recon- ciled into a common calendar, and while the modern civil calendar is based on the year, the dates of religious festivals (such as Easter) are still set by reference to the lunar month. The week is not based on any astronomical phenomena but instead derives from the Jewish and Christian tradition that every seventh day should be a day of rest. The ancient Egyptians were the first to use a calendar based on a solar year, the Babylonians having used a lunar y ear of 12 months, adding extra months when it became necessary to keep the calendar in step with the seasons. Our present calendar is based on that of the Romans, which originally had only ten months. Julius Caesar, on the advice of the Greek astronomer Sosigenes, intro- duced the Julian Calendar in 45 BC . This was a solar cal- endar based on a year of 365.25 days, but fixed at 365 days, with a leap year of 366 days every fourth year to compensate. The year commenced on March 25 and the Julian Calendar, which was completed by Caesar Augus- tus in 44 BC , also established the present-day names, lengths and order of the months. The Julian year of 365.25 days is slightly different from the solar year of 365.2419 days (being 11 m 14 s longer) but accumulates an error of almost eight days every 1000 years. By the 16th century this error had become noticeable, the VERNAL EQUINOX , for example, occurring 10 days early in 1582. To correct this error, P ope Gregory XIII removed 10 days from the calendar so in 1582, October 15 followed October 4, and instigat- ed the use of a new system known as the Gregorian cal- endar in which only century years divisible by 400 (for 65 C C \u0001 caldera A Magellan radar image of Sacajawea Patera, in the western part of Ishtar Terra on Venus.

The start of the year was also changed to January 1. By the time this ‘New Style’ calendar, as it was known, w as adopted in Great Britain in 1752 the error had increased to 11 days, so that September 14 followed Sep- tember 2. This is why the British financial year ends on April 5 – the old New Year’s Day (March 25) plus the 11 days lost in 1752. T oday the Gregorian calendar, which repeats every 400 years since this equates to an exact number of weeks, is used throughout the Western world and parts of Asia. It is also known as the Christian calendar since it uses the birth of Christ as a starting point, subsequent dates being designated anno domini (in the year of our Lord) and pre- ceding dates being BC (before Christ). The accumulated error between the Gregorian year and the true solar year now amounts to just three days in 10,000 years. The two other major calendars in use today are the J ewish and Muslim calendars, both of which are based on a lunar year. The Jewish is derived from the ancient Hebrew calendar and is based on lunar months of 29 and 30 days alternately, with an intercalary month insert- ed every three years. The length of the Muslim year is also 12 months of alternate lengths 30 and 29 days, except for the 12th month which can have either 29 or 30 days.

It has an albedo of only 0.2. Callisto is heavily cratered and is the only member of the group to show no clear surface signs of current or past geological activity. Callisto’s density of 1.9 g/cm 3 suggests that it is composed of rock and ice in a 40:60 mixture. Gravity measurements made by the Galileo orbiter during close flybys of Callisto suggest that its interior is only weakly dif- ferentiated ( see DIFFERENTIATION ), and that the rock is not all concentrated into a core, in contrast to Callisto’s neigh- bour GANYMEDE . Perplexingly, measurements made by the Galileo orbiter hinted at a magnetic field, apparently generated at a shallow depth within Callisto as a result of its orbital passage through Jupiter’s MAGNETOSPHERE . One wa y to explain this would be if Callisto has a salty ocean no more than 100 km (60 mi) below its icy surface, but this is hard to reconcile with the great age of the surface implied by the density of CRATERS . Although Callisto’s craters are clearly produced by meteoroidal or cometary impact, they are rather different from those found on the Moon. For example, Callisto has ve ry few craters less than about 60 km (40 mi) in diame- ter, showing that the satellite was bombarded by a differ- ent population of impactors from that responsible for lunar craters. The largest craters have a subdued shape, as if Callisto’s LITHOSPHERE has not been strong enough to support their topography. There are also a few enormous impact basins marked by concentric rings of fractures; the largest of these, named V ALHALLA , is about 4000 km (2500 mi) across. About a dozen linear chains of craters have been identified on Callisto, each of which was proba- bly produced by the serial impact of fragments of a comet broken up by tidal forces during a close passage of Jupiter ( see SHOEMAKER – LEVY 9). See data at JUPITER Caloris Planitia (‘Basin of Heat’) Largest single feature on MERCURY imaged by MARINER 10. It is situated near one of the planet’s hot poles and centred on 30º.5N 189º.8W. The Caloris Planitia is an enormous multi-ring impact structure 1300 km (800 mi) in diameter – a quarter that of the planet. Imaged half-lit from the departing spacecraft, it is defined by a ring of discontinuous mountains, the Montes Caloris, roughly 2 km (1.2 mi) high. The BASIN floor consists of smooth plains with quasi-concentric and other ridges, transected by younger crack-like GRABEN . The ejecta blanket extends to a distance of approximately 700 km (430 mi) beyond the Montes Caloris; it comprises tracts of uneven hummocky plains and lineated terrain. The whole structure is undoubtedly the modified scar left by the impact of an asteroid-sized body, the floor being the end result of refilling of the crater by the crusting-over, semi-molten ASTHENOSPHERE . On the other side of Mer- cury, antipodal to Caloris, is a region of ‘weird terrain’, an extraordinary place of hills and valleys that break into other landforms; it probably formed as a result of shock- wa v es from the impact that created Caloris.

As director of Lick Observatory (1900–1930), he founded the observatory’s southern- hemisphere station in Chile and designed important acces- sory instruments for Lick’s telescopes, including the Mills spectrographs. Campbell led an eclipse expedition in 1922, which confirmed Einstein’s general theory of relativity by showing that the Sun’s mass was sufficient to deflect light wa v es from other stars. With Heber CURTIS , he undertook a huge photographic survey of stellar spectra to determine the radial velocities of stars. This project had two important results: it allowed Campbell to map the local Milky Way and our Sun’s motion relative to other nearby stars, and it led to the discovery of over a thousand spectroscopic binaries. Canada–France–Hawaii telescope Optical/infrared telescope of 3.6-m (142-in.) aperture located at MAUNA KEA OBSERVATORY and operated jointly by the National Research Council of Canada, the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France and the University of Hawaii.

In 1877 Giovanni SCHIAPARELLI marked a number of very narrow features on his map of Mars which he referred to as canali , which in Italian means ‘channels’ or ‘canals’. But when his findings were translated into English, it was the latter sense, with its implication of artificial construction, that found its way into reports. Controversy continued in the 1880s, some astronomers claiming they could see the ‘canals’, while others could not. In the 1890s, their exis- tence was championed by Percival LOWELL , who founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, largely to study them. He became convinced that they were waterways constructed by intelligent beings to irrigate a desiccating planet. Only when close-up images were returned by the Mariner craft and later Mars probes was the existence of canals disproved with certainty. Martian ‘canals’ make an intriguing episode in the annals of observational astronomy. No canal was ever convincingly photographed, yet highly detailed maps were prepared from sketches made at the eyepiece that showed canals in prodigious numbers. Their explanation is part psychological, part physiological. There is no denying the integrity of some who reported having observed canals, b ut equally there is no doubting that other observers were ov er-zealous in seeking evidence to fit a theory. The phys- iological factor was explained by Eugène ANTONIADI and others. When the eye is straining to discern detail at the ve ry limits of visibility – and the disk of Mars is small, even at favourable oppositions – the brain can misinter- pret what the eye beholds. In particular, in conditions of low contrast, it ‘joins the dots’ to form lines between dis- crete features, and conjures firm borders between areas of differing brightness.

This process is thought to explain how CD GALAX - IES at the centres of clusters have become so bright and massive. Cannibalism of dwarf satellites also seems to have played a role in the growth of the halos of SPIRAL GALAXIES , exemplified by the distinct streams of stars in the Milky Way and the ANDROMEDA GALAXY , which may be the assimilated remnants of former companions. Cannon, Annie Jump (1863–1941) American astronomer who, working at the Harvard College Obser- va tory under the direction of Edward C. PICKERING , refined the system for classifying stellar spectra. In 1896, after teaching physics at Wellesley College, Cannon joined Harvard’s staff of ‘Pickering’s women’, a group of com- puting assistants hired mainly to work on the HENRY DRAP - ER CATALOGUE of stellar spectra. T aking the alphabetical spectral classification begun by Williamina FLEMING and Antonia C. MAURY , Cannon dropped several categories and rearranged the sequence to give O, B, A, F, G, K, M, from the hottest stars to the coolest. White or blue stars were classified as type O, B or A, yellow stars as F or G, orange stars were designated K, and red stars as M. This scheme, which is the basis for the present-day HARVARD SYSTEM of spectral classification, w as used by Cannon in the first ever catalogue of stellar spectra, for the 1122 brightest stars (1901). Later, she added types R, N and S, plus ten subcategories based upon finer spectral features. In the course of her work, Cannon visually examined and classified hundreds of thousands of spectra: the Henry Draper Catalogue , filling nine volumes of the Harvard Annals , ultimately contained almost 400,000 stars sorted by spectral class. Cannon also discovered five novae, 300 new variable stars and published extensive catalogues of these objects in 1903 and 1907. She was the first woman to be elected an officer of the American Astronomical Society, but because of a reluctance of the scientific com- munity to accept women in astronomy, she did not receive a regular appointment at Harvard until 1938, just two y ears before she retired. Canopus The star \u0001 Carinae, the second-brightest star in the entire sky, visual mag. \u0002 0.62, distance 313 l.y. It is a white supergiant of spectral type F0 Ib, more than 10,000 times as luminous as the Sun. The Hipparcos satellite detected variations of about 0.1 mag., but the period (if any) and cause of the variation are not known. Canopus is named after the helmsman of the Greek King Menelaus. Cape Canaveral See KENNEDY SPACE CENTER Capella The star \u0001 Aurigae, at visual mag. 0.08 the sixth-brightest star in the sky, distance 42 l.y. It is a spectroscopic binary, consisting of two yellow giants with an orbital period of 104 days. Various spectral types have been given for this pair, but they are likely to be near G6 III and G2 III. The star’s name comes from the Latin meaning ‘she-goat’.

Carbon has seven ISOTOPES , with atomic masses from 10 to 16, two of which are stable (carbon-12 and carbon-13). Car- bon-12 is used to define the AT OMIC MASS UNIT , and so its atomic mass is exactly 12. The naturally occurring ele- ment contains carbon-12 (98.89%) and carbon-13 (1.11%) plus variable but small amounts of carbon-14. In its free state, carbon exists as amorphous carbon, graphite and diamond. Carbon is unique in the vast number and variety of compounds that it can form. The study of its reactions forms the entire discipline of organic chemistry. Carbon’s property of forming hexagonal rings and long-chain mol- ecules and of linking with hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen makes it the basis of life. In the form of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) it produces the two most sig- nificant GREENHOUSE gases. Carbon-14 is radioactive, with a half-life of 5730 years, and forms the basis for carbon-dating archaeologi- cal remains. It is continually produced in the Earth’s atmosphere from nitrogen-14 by COSMIC RAYS . Once produced, it is incorporated into living material. After the death of the organism, the decay of the carbon-14 slowly reduces its abundance relative to carbon-12, and so allows determination of the age. Carbon plays an important role in the CARBON – NITRO - GEN – OXYGEN CYCLE , which is the major helium-produc- ing nuclear reaction in massive stars. It is unusually abundant in some types of peculiar star ( see ASTROCHEM - ISTRY ), and may comprise the bulk of the material form- ing some white dwarfs. carbonaceous chondrite Chondritic METEORITE with atomic magnesium to silicon ratio greater than 1.02.

MICROMETEORITES show many similarities to CM chondrites. Meteorites in the CV (for Vigarano) group have large CHONDRULES and are rich in refractory elements, such as aluminium and iridium. CV chondrites contain centimetre-sized CALCIUM – ALU - MINIUM - RICH INCLUSIONS (CAIs), but little carbon or wa ter. ALLENDE is a member of this group. The CO (for Ornans) group has smaller chondrules and CAIs. It is poorer in refractories than CV chondrites. CO chondrites also contain little water or carbon. The CR (for Renazzo) group of chondrites is characterized by abundant, well- defined chondrules and high metal content. The CK (for Karoonda) group is mostly thermally metamorphosed and re-crystallized chondrites. Members of the CH group (H for high iron content) have very small chondrules and high metal contents. carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle (CNO cycle, CN cycle, Bethe–Weizsäcker cycle) Cycle of nuclear reactions that accounts for the energy production inside MAIN - SEQUENCE stars of mass greater than the Sun. The cycle was first described, independently, by Hans BETHE and Carl von WEIZSÄCKER in 1938. The reactions involve the fusion of four hydrogen nuclei ( PROTONS ) into one helium nucleus at temperatures in excess of 4 million K. The cycle is temperature depen- dent, and at temperatures greater than 20 million K it becomes the dominant energy-producing mechanism in stellar cores. The mass of one helium nucleus (4.0027 atomic mass units) is less than the total mass of four pro- tons (4.0304 units) so some matter is converted into ener- gy and emitted as gamma rays. Positrons and NEUTRINOS are also emitted during the cycle. The presence of carbon as one of the reactants is essen- tial, but it behaves like a catalyst. Carbon-12 is used in the first reaction, but after a series of reactions, during which four hydrogen nuclei are absorbed and a helium nucleus is formed, carbon-12 is reproduced. Isotopes of carbon, oxygen and nitrogen occur as transient intermediate prod- ucts during the reactions. carbon star (C star) Classically, a cool GIANT STAR , between about 5800 and 2000 K, that exhibits strong spectral absorptions of C 2 , CN and CH and that has an atmosphere containing more carbon than oxygen. The original classes, RST ARS (comparable in temperature with GST ARS and KST ARS ) and NST ARS (comparable with M STARS ), are combined into class C. N stars are on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) of the HERTZSPRUNG – RUSSELL DIAGRAM (HR diagram). As main-sequence stars evolve on to the upper AGB, those of intermediate mass can dredge up carbon made by the TRIPLE - \u0001 PROCESS into their atmospheres, turning first into carbon-rich SST ARS and then into genuine carbon stars. When carbon exceeds oxygen, the two combine to make molecules (particularly CO), leaving no oxygen to make metallic oxides. The rest of the carbon then combines with itself and other atoms. Most N-type carbon stars are irregular, semi-regular, or Mira variables. Carbon dust forming in strong stellar winds can surround, or even bury, the stars in molecule- rich shrouds, the stars being visible only in the infrared. Such carbon stars are also rich in elements created by the s process. Carbon stars are a major source of galactic dust and a significant source of interstellar carbon. The warmer R stars appear to be core-helium-burning 71 C \u0001 carbonaceous chondrite A thin section of the Cold Bokkeveld meteorite, which fell in Cape Province, South Africa, in 1838.

By making daily measurements of sunspot positions during the years 1853–61, he discov- ered, independently of Gustav SPÖRER , that the Sun’s equatorial regions rotate faster than its more extreme lati- tudes. From a sunspot’s heliographic latitude, he was able to predict how quickly the spot would move across the solar disk. In 1859 Carrington became the first person to observe a solar flare, one sufficiently energetic to be visible to the naked eye, and noted that it was followed by auroral displays. He also compiled an important catalogue (1857) of almost 4000 circumpolar stars. Carrington rotation Mean period of 25.38 days intro- duced in the 19th century by the English astronomer Richard C. CARRINGTON from observations of SUNSPOTS as the mean length of time taken for the Sun to rotate on its axis at the equator with respect to the fixed stars. Since the Earth revolves about the Sun in the same direction that the Sun rotates, this SIDEREAL PERIOD is lengthened to a SYNODIC PERIOD of 27.28 days when observed from Earth. Beginning with that which commenced on 1853 Novem- ber 9, the Sun’s synodic rotations are numbered sequen- tially; Carrington defined the zero of solar longitude as the central solar meridian on this day. For example, Carring- ton Rotation 1985 commenced on 2002 January 7. Carte du Ciel Programme initiated in 1887 by the broth- ers HENRY and others to map the whole sky in 22,000 pho- tographs taken from 18 observatories, using identical ‘astrograph’ telescopes. One of the first large international astronomical projects, the Carte du Ciel took about 60 years to complete. The project also included the genera- tion of the Astrographic Catalogue , listing several million stars down to 11th magnitude, which has since proved invaluable for the derivation of accurate proper motions.

Cartwheel Galaxy (MCG-06-02-022a) STARBURST GALAXY in the southern constellation Sculptor (RA 00 h 37 m .4 dec. \u0001 33º44 \u0002 ). It lies about 500 million l.y. away. The galaxy’s structure has been disrupted by the recent passage through it of a second, dwarf galaxy, which trig- gered an episode of star formation in the ring-shaped rim. The rim has a diameter of 150,000 l.y., and spokes of material extend towards it from the galaxy’s centre. cascade image tube Type of IMAGE INTENSIFIER used to amplify the brightness of faint optical images through a multistage process. In a simple image tube, the incident light beam falls on to a photocathode, liberating a stream of electrons. These electrons are accelerated by an electric field of around 40 kV and are focused by either a magnet- ic or electrostatic field on to a phosphor screen to form an Carina 72 C \u0001 Cartwheel Galaxy An Anglo-Australian Telescope photograph of this irregular galaxy, whose ring and spoke configuration is a result of a comparatively recent encounter with another galaxy.

Light is gathered by the primary and reflected to the secondary, which is placed in the light path on the optical axis. The convex secondary increases the focal length by enough for the light to pass through a hole in the primary before coming to a focus behind it. This ‘folding’ of the light path results in an instrument that is much more compact than a refractor or Newtonian of the same focal length. The Cassegrain has no chromat- ic or spherical ABERRATION , but does suffer from slight astigmatism, moderate coma and strong field curvature. The design is credited to the French priest Laurent Cassegrain (1629–93), but did not become popular until the late 19th century because of the difficulty of accu- rately figuring the convex hyperboloidal secondary mir- ror. However, this eventually became the commonest design for large professional telescopes, and popular for compact amateur instruments, leading to the develop- ment of many variations, such as the D ALL – KIRKHAM TELESCOPE , SCHMIDT – CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE and RITCHEY – CHRÉTIEN TELESCOPE . Cassini NASA spacecraft launched to SATURN in 1997 November. In 2004 November, it will become the first spacecraft to orbit Saturn and will also deploy the Euro- pean Space Agency craft HUYGENS , which is scheduled to land on the surface of the Saturnian moon TITAN . Cassini flew towards Saturn via two gravity assist flybys of Venus and one of the Earth, and in 2000–2001 it con- ducted, with the orbiting GALILEO , the first dual-space- craft Jupiter science mission. Cassini family French family of Italian origin that pro- duced four astronomers and cartographers, all associated with P ARIS OBSERVATORY , which was set up by Giovanni Domenico CASSINI (known to historians as Cassini I) at the invitation of Louis XIV of France. The elder Cassini’s son, J acques (or Giacomo ) Cassini (1677–1756, Cassi- ni II), assumed directorship of Paris Observatory in 1700. J acques’ major contributions were in geodesy and cartog- raphy: he established the definitive arc of the Paris Merid- ian, and conceived a method for finding longitudes by observing lunar occultations of stars and planets. In 1771 Jacques’ son, César-François (or Cesare Francesco ) Cassini de Thury (1714–84, Cassini III), became the observatory’s director. César-François was responsible for producing the first truly reliable map of France, which took half a century to complete. Despite this work, the fortunes of Paris Observatory declined dur- ing his directorship, due to lack of government support and competition from better-funded private observato- r ies. After his death in 1784, his son J acques Dominique Cassini (1748–1845, Cassini IV) took over the observa- tory and restored its former prestige. Cassini, Giovanni Domenico (1625–1712) Italian astronomer and geodesist (also known as Jean Dominique after his move to France, and to historians as Cassini I) who founded P ARIS OBSERVATORY and helped to establish the scale of the Solar System. As a result of his important studies of the Sun and Venus, Mars and Jupiter carried out at Bologna University, he was invited to plan the new Paris Observatory, built between 1667 and 1672 by order of Louis XIV. Cassini became the observatory’s director and used its very long focal length, tubeless refracting telescopes to discover, in 1675, the division in Saturn’s ring system that today bears his name. He also discovered four Saturnian moons (1671–84). He constructed a lunar map from eight years of original observations; this map served as the standard for the next 100 years. Cassini accurately determined the rotation periods of Mars and Venus, and his studies of Jupiter’s satellites enabled Ole RÖMER to calculate the velocity of light by observing the delay in satellite eclipse intervals caused by va ri a tions of Jupiter’s distance from the Earth. Most importantly, Cassini established the scale of the Solar Sys- tem. He derived a measure of Mars’ parallax from his own Pa r is observations and those made by Jean RICHER from Cayenne, South America, that corresponded to a value of 140 million km (85 million mi) for the astronomical unit. Although 10 million km (6 million mi) short of the true figure, this was a huge improvement on previous values (for example, Johannes Kepler’s estimate of 15 million km/10 million mi). After Cassini’s health failed in 1700, his son Jacques assumed the directorship of Paris Obser- va tory ( see CASSINI FAMILY ). Cassini Division Main division in SATURN ’s ring system, separating the bright ARING and B RING at a distance of 117,600 km (73,100 mi) from the planet’s centre. The Cassini Division is not empty: VOYA GER results show that it contains several narrow rings and that there are particles in the gaps between these rings. 73 C \u0001 Cassegrain telescope A cutaway showing the light path in a Cassegrain telescope.

See table at NEAR - EARTH ASTEROID Castor The star \u0001 Geminorum, visual mag. 1.58, distance 52 l.y. Castor is a remarkable multiple star. Small telescopes show it as a double star, with blue-white components of mags. 2.0 and 2.9, spectral types A2 V and A5 V; these form a genuine binary with an orbital period of about 450 years, separation currently increasing. Each component is also a spectroscopic binary, with periods of 9.2 and 2.9 days respectively. There is also a third member of the Castor system, known as YY Geminorum, an ALGOL STAR eclipsing binary consisting of two red dwarfs, both of spectral type M1. During eclipses, which occur every 19.5 hours, their total visual magnitude drops from 9.3 to 9.8. Castor is named after one of the celestial twins commemorated by the constellation Gemini, the other being POLLUX . cataclysmic variable (CV) Term given to a diverse group of stars that undergo eruptions, irrespective of the cause of the outburst. The term may describe a SUPERNOVA , NOVA , RECURRENT NOVA , NOVA - LIKE VARIABLE , FLARE STAR , DW ARF NOVA , some X-ray objects, and other erupting stars. CVs are very close binary systems, with outbursts caused by interaction between the two components. A typical system of this type has a low mass secondary which fills its ROCHE LOBE , so that material is transferred through its LAGRANGIAN POINT on to the primary, which is usually a WHITE DWARF . The transferred material has too much angular momentum to fall directly on to the primary; instead, it forms an ACCRETION DISK , on which a hot spot is formed where the infalling material impacts on its outer edge. For any particular star, outbursts occur at irregular intervals from about ten days to weeks, months or many years. Most dwarf novae and recurrent novae show a relation- ship between maximum brightness and length of the mean cycle: the shorter the cycle, the fainter the maxi- mum magnitude. Nova-like variables are a less homoge- neous group and are also less well-studied. Some have bursts of limited amplitude; others have had no observed outburst but have spectra resembling old novae. There are many other objects that show some if not all of the charac- teristics of CVs, for example old novae, some X-ray objects, AM HERCULIS STARS and others. Many models have been suggested to explain the observed outbursts. The two most probable theories are that they are caused either by variations in the rate of MASS TRANSFER or by instabilities in the accretion disk. Both models require transfer of mass from the red secondary. A few systems are so aligned that we see them undergoing eclipses, enabling the main light source to be studied in detail. Typical examples of such systems are Z Chamaeleontis and OY Carinae; these stars may be exam- ined both at outburst and minimum. It appears that dur- ing outbursts the disk increases in brightness. The intervals between consecutive outbursts of the same type vary widely, as they do for most CVs. Z Chamaeleontis has a mean cycle for normal outbursts of 82 days; for super-outbursts the mean cycle is 287 days. For OY Cari- nae the respective values are about 50 and 318 days. Their semiperiodic oscillations, timed in seconds, are small. The advantage of studying eclipsing systems is that both the primary and the hot spot may be eclipsed, indi- cating the probable sizes of the components. It is generally agreed that a variable mass-flow rate can account for many observations. For the mass-flow rate to vary, there must be instability in the red star, but no generally accept- ed theory has been advanced. The red star must relax after a burst until another surge again overflows, discharg- ing another burst of gas, but exactly what causes this ebb and flow is a mystery. The angular momentum of the mass flow prevents it from falling directly on to the prima- ry. Instead a disk is formed around it on which a hot spot is formed at the point of impact. Some of this matter must be carried away, and it is not known whether this material is lost to the system or whether it splashes back on to the disk. When an eclipsing system is at minimum, the main light source at primary eclipse comes from the red star. The disk is then in a steady state. Theories stipulating that the cause of the outburst is instabilities in the disk, while accepting variable mass transfer as the origin of the subsequent observed phenom- ena, contend that it is what happens on the disk that gives rise to outbursts. A number of disk models have been pro- posed, but none appears to fit the observed facts. For example, the disk increases in brightness during outbursts, at least in the eclipsing systems, and presumably in other dwarf novae. Disk instability models differ on how this released energy spreads through the disk, which mainly radiates in the ultraviolet. This ultraviolet radiation does not behave in the same way as the visual radiation and appears to contradict these models. If the disk dumps energy on to the primary, nuclear burning would be expected, but evidence on this is unclear. catadioptric system Telescope or other optical system that includes both mirrors and lenses. To be considered catadioptric, at least one lens and mirror must be optically active (it must converge, diverge or correct the optical path) – flat mirrors and optical ‘windows’ do not count. So, for instance, the SCHMIDT – CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE and MAKSUTOV TELESCOPE are both catadioptric, the light passing through an optically figured corrector plate before striking the primary mirror, but a folded refractor or a Cassegrain telescope with a flat optical window is not. The catadioptric design is compact, and is often used for portable instruments. catalogue, astronomical Ta b ular compilation of stars or other deep-sky objects, giving their CELESTIAL COOR - DINATES and other parameters, such as magnitude.

A list of cata- logues is given in the Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celes- tial Objects , maintained under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union. Before the modern era, cataloguers such as AL - SU ̄ FI ̄ w ere concerned mainly with refining the positions and magnitudes given in the Almagest . The need for improved navigation that came with European expansion after the Renaissance provided the impetus for early modern catalogues such as John FLAMSTEED ’s Historia coelestis brittanica . As the power of telescopes increased, more and more stars were revealed for the cataloguers to measure. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, photographic methods supplanted visual observation as a means of gathering data, and catalogues swelled to contain hundreds of thousands of entries. Stars are known by their designations in catalogues, preceded by the catalogue’s initials ( see STELLAR NOMENCLATURE ). Three great Durchmusterungen (‘surveys’ in German) w ere compiled between 1855 and 1932 at Bonn, Córdoba and Cape Town, gathering together 1.5 million positions and magnitudes for about 1 million stars over the whole sky: the BONNER DURCHMUSTERUNG (BD), the CÓRDOBA DURCHMUSTERUNG (CD) and the CAPE PHOTOGRAPHIC DURCHMUSTERUNG (CPD). The first major catalogue of stellar spectra was the HENRY DRAPER CATALOGUE (HD), classifying 360,000 stars by spectral type, compiled by Annie CANNON and published between 1918 and 1936. The first major astrometric and photometric catalogues were produced by, respectively, Lewis and Benjamin BOSS and by Friedrich ZÖLLNER . Other notable star catalogues include the Astrographic Catalogue from the CARTE DU CIEL project; the BRIGHT STAR CATALOGUE (BS), with accurate values of the positions, parallaxes, proper motion, magnitudes, colours, spectral types and other parameters for the 9110 stars brighter than magnitude 6.5; the 1966 SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY STAR CATALOG (SAO), the first large ‘synthetic’ catalogue created on a computer by combining data from several astrometric catalogues; the GUIDE STAR CATALOGUE (GSC), created for the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990; and the 1997 HIPPARCOS CATALOGUE (HIP) and Tycho Catalogue (TYC), the products of the Hipparcos astrometry mission. Many other star catalogues have been compiled for specific categories of stars, such as the Catalogue of Nearby Stars (Gl, after its compiler, Wilhelm Gliese, 1915–93). Important early catalogues of double stars w ere prepared by Wilhelm STRUVE ( \u0002 ), Otto STRUVE (O \u0002 ), Sherburne BURNHAM (BPS) and Robert AITKEN (ADS); the principal modern source is the 1996 W ashington Visual Double Star Catalog (WDS) by C.E. W orley and G.C. Douglass. For variable stars the current reference is the GENERAL CATALOGUE OF VARIABLE STARS . Stars with high proper motion are listed in William LUYTEN ’s Tw o-Tenths Catalog of Proper Motions (1979–80). FUNDAMENTAL CATALOGUES gi ve highly accurate positions and proper motions for selected stars against which the relative positions of other celestial objects may be measured. There are also many catalogues of non-stellar objects. The earliest is the famous MESSIER CATALOGUE (M); there followed John HERSCHEL ’s General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters , and J.L.E. Dreyer’s NEW GENERAL CATALOGUE (NGC) and INDEX CATALOGUES (IC). The NGC and the two ICs together represent the last a ttempt to include all known non-stellar objects in a single listing before the advent of today’s powerful SURVEY capabilities. Subsequent catalogues dealing with specific objects included: Edward Emerson BARNARD ’s 1927 list of dark nebulae, Catalogue of 349 Dark Objects in the Sky (B); S. Sharpless’ 1959 listing of emission nebulae, A Catalogue of H II Regions (Sh-2); and the Catalog of Galactic Planetary Nebulae by Lubos ˇP erek (1919– ) and Lubos ˇ Kohoutek (1935– ) published in 1967 (PK). Catalogues of galaxies include the 1962–68 Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies (MCG or VV, from author Boris Alexandrovich Vorontsov-Vel’iaminov, 1904–94) and 1973 Uppsala General Catalogue of Galaxies (UGC) by Peter Nilson (1937–98). Peculiar galaxies have been catalogued by Halton ARP , and clusters of galaxies by George ABELL . Catalogues have also been compiled for sources of radiation outside the optical region. The first Cambridge catalogue, of the 50 brightest radio sources, was published in 1950 ( see THIRD CAMBRIDGE CATALOGUE ). A recent radio catalogue, The NRAO VLA Sky Survey, nearing completion, has yielded a catalogue of over 1.7 million radio sources north of dec. \u0003 40º. At the other end of the electromagnetic spectrum, the Rosat catalogues (RX) are currently the most frequently used sources for X-ray emitters. catena Chain of CRATERS .

CCD (charge-coupled device) Small electronic imaging device, widely used in astronomy, which is highly efficient in its response to light and therefore able to detect very faint objects over a broad range of the spectrum. CCDs consist of an oxide-covered silicon substrate with a two-dimensional rectangular array of light-sensitive electrodes on the surface. These electrodes form a matrix of pixels, or picture elements, each less than 0.03 nm in size and capable of storing electronic charges created by the absorption of light. Photons imaged on to the surface of the CCD penetrate the electrode structure and enter the substrate, where elec- tron–hole pairs are generated via the photoelectric effect, in numbers precisely proportional to the number of inci- dent photons. The holes are conveniently lost by diffusion down into the depths of the substrate, while the electrons migrate rapidly to the nearest biased electrode, where they collect as a single charge packet in a ‘potential well’. Since it is impractical to wire the output from each indi- vidual electrode, the signal charge is transferred through the array, from one pixel to the next, by changing the voltages on each one. Pixels in adjacent rows are said to be ‘charge- coupled’ and the signal can move in parallel from row to row. As each row of signals reaches the end of the CCD it is read off into a serial register from which it can be stored in a computer, processed and the final image displayed. Because the charge in each pixel is in proportion to the number of photons that have fallen on it, the output from a CCD is linear, which in turn means that the brightness of the final image produced is directly related to the brightness of object being observed, something which is not true for photographic emulsions. In order to generate electron–hole pairs, photons have to pass through the electrode structure, and some are inevitably absorbed in this layer. Because of this, the quan- tum efficiency of front-illuminated CCDs is poor in the blue and UV regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. To ov ercome this, the silicon substrate can be thinned to around 15 \u0006 m and the CCD back-illuminated, thus elimi- nating the need for the photons to negotiate the electrode structure. This process can increase the sensitivity of a CCD by a factor of two and the use of anti-reflective coat- ings can also improve quantum efficiency. One of the other problems that has to be overcome when using CCDs is the generation of ‘dark current’. This is the unwanted charge that is created by the natural ran- dom generation and recombination of electron–hole pairs that occurs at temperatures above absolute zero. This thermally induced charge can mask the signal when observing very faint objects over a long period of time but can be effectively eliminated by cooling the CCD using liquid nitrogen. A low dark current makes it possible to store the signal charge for long periods of time, thus allow- ing exposures from a few tens of seconds to several hours to be achieved. CCDs can thus be used to accumulate signals from ve ry faint light sources. They are more sensitive than photographic emulsion, are linear, spatially uniform and stable with time. They are also sensitive over a broad range of the spectrum, have low noise levels and a large dynamic range so that they can be used to detect both bright and faint objects at the same time. They can be used for direct imaging applications, surveying large areas of sky, for photometry or as spectroscopic detec- tors. Because of their versatility, they have almost com- pletely replaced photographic plates. CD Abbreviation of CÓRDOBA DURCHMUSTERUNG cD galaxy Largest, most luminous kind of normal GALAXY . Often found at the centres of rich clusters, they resemble giant ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES except for having a more extensive outer envelope of stars. Some cD galax- ies can be traced over spans exceeding a million light- y ears. They may grow as a result of attracting stars that w ere stripped from surrounding galaxies by tidal encounters, either within the cluster as a whole or with the cD galaxy. This class was recognized by William W. MORGAN as part of the Yerkes system of galaxy classifica- tion, along with N GALAXIES . CDS Abbreviation of CENTRE DE DONNÉES ASTRONOMIQUES DE STRASBOURG celestial coordinates Reference system used to define the positions of points or celestial objects on the celestial sphere. A number of systems are in use, depending on the application. EQUATORIAL COORDINATES are the most commonly used and are the equivalent of latitude and longitude on the Earth’s surface. DECLINATION is a measure of an object’s angular distance north or south of the CELESTIAL EQUATOR , values north being positive and those south negative. RIGHT ASCENSION , or RA, equates to longitude and is measured in hours, minutes and seconds eastwards from the FIRST POINT OF ARIES , the intersection of the celestial equator with the ECLIPTIC . HOUR ANGLE and POLAR DISTANCE can also be used as alternative measures. The HORIZONTAL COORDINATE system uses the observ- er’s horizon as the plane of reference, measuring the ALTI - TUDE (angular measure of an object above the horizon) and AZIMUTH (bearing measured westward around the horizon from north). ECLIPTIC COORDINATES are based upon the plane of the ECLIPTIC and use the measures of CELESTIAL LATITUDE and CELESTIAL LONGITUDE (also known as ecliptic latitude and ecliptic longitude). Celestial latitude is measured in degrees north and south of the ecliptic, while celestial lon- g itude is measured in degrees eastwards along the ecliptic from the First Point of Aries. The GALACTIC COORDINATE system takes the plane of the Galaxy and the galactic centre (RA 17 h 46 m dec. \u0007 28º56 \u0004 ) as its reference points. Galactic latitude is mea- sured from 0º at the galactic equator to 90º at the galactic pole, while galactic longitude is measured from 0º to 360º eastwards along the galactic equator. celestial equator Projection on to the CELESTIAL SPHERE of the Earth’s equatorial plane.

See also CELESTIAL LATITUDE celestial mechanics (dynamical astronomy) Discipline concerned with using the laws of physics to explain and predict the orbits of the planets, satellites and other celes- tial bodies. For many years the main effort in the subject w as the development of mathematical methods to gener- a te the lengthy series of perturbation terms that are need- ed to calculate an accurate position of a planet. The advent of computers has eased this task considerably, with the result that the main emphasis of the subject has changed dramatically. Much effort is now devoted to the study of the origin, evolution and stability of various dynamical features of the Solar System, and in particular of the numerous intricate details of rings and satellite orbits revealed by the VOYA GER spacecraft. The subject can be said to have started with the publi- cation of Newton’s P RINCIPIA in 1687, in which are stated his law of gravitation, which describes the forces acting on the bodies, and his three laws of motion, which describe how these forces cause accelerations of the motions of the bodies. Then the techniques of celestial mechanics are used to determine the orbits of the bodies resulting from these accelerations. One of the first results achieved by Newton was to give an explanation of KEPLER ’ SLAWS . These laws are descriptions deduced from observations of the motions of the planets as being elliptical orbits around the Sun, but until the work of Newton no satisfactory explanation of these empirical laws had been given. How- ever, Kepler’s laws are true only for an isolated system of two bodies; in the real Solar System the attractions of the other planets and satellites cause the orbits to depart sig- nificantly from elliptical motion and, as observational accuracy improved, these perturbations became apparent. The greatest mathematicians of the 18th and 19th cen- turies were involved in the effort of calculating and pre- dicting the perturbations of the orbits, in order to match the ever-increasing accuracy and time span of the obser- va tions. The orbit of the Moon was the major problem, partly because the Moon is nearby, and so the accuracy of observation is high, but also because its orbit around the Earth is very highly perturbed by the Sun. Va ri ous techniques were developed for calculating the perturbations of an orbit. An important technique is the method of the ‘variation of arbitrary constants’, devel- oped by Leonhard EULER and Joseph LAGRANGE . An unperturbed orbit can be described by the six ORBITAL ELEMENTS , or arbitrary constants, of the ellipse. The effect of perturbations can be described by allowing these ‘constants’ to vary with time. Thus, for example, the eccentricity of the orbit may be described as a constant plus a number of periodic terms. The resulting expres- sions are called the ‘theory of the motion of the body’, and can be very lengthy in order to achieve the desired accuracy, perhaps hundreds of periodic terms. Around the middle of the 19th century an alternative method was developed in which the perturbations of the three coordi- nates of the body (for example, longitude, latitude and distance from the Sun) are calculated instead of the per- turbations of the six elements. Variants of this method have been used ever since for lunar and planetary theo- r ies, but the variation of constants is still more suitable for many of the satellites. The latest theories used to calculate the positions of the Moon and planets in the almanacs used by navigators and astronomers are those derived by: Simon NEWCOMB for the five inner planets, Uranus and Neptune; by Ernest BROWN for the Moon; and by George HILL for Jupiter and Saturn. Overall, Newton’s four laws and the techniques of celestial mechanics have proved successful at explaining the motions of the planets and satellites. Problems with the orbit of the Moon were eventually resolved by improved theories, and anomalous perturbations of the orbit of Uranus led John Couch ADAMS and Urbain LE VERRIER to suspect the existence of a further planet, which resulted in the discovery of Neptune in 1846 close to the predicted position. Problems with the seemingly unaccountably rapid advance of Mercury’s perihelion w ere eventually solved in 1915 with the publication of Einstein’s general theory of relativity ( see VULCAN ). This is a more accurate representation of the laws of motion under the action of gravitation, but the differences from using Newton’s laws are small, and only become notice- able in strong gravity fields. By the early 20th century fairly good theories had been developed for the Moon and the planets, but these had just about reached the limit of what was possible with the means then available, of mechanical calculators, mathe- matical tables, and masses of hand algebra. There was some further effort on theories for other satellites and some asteroids, but much effort in the subject moved into other areas, particularly into theoretical studies such as the idealized THREE - BODY PROBLEM . With the advent of com- puters, renewed effort on the development of lunar and planetary theories became feasible. The initial idea was to use the same techniques as before, but to do the vast amounts of algebraic manipulation involved on a comput- er. Excellent theories of the Moon and some of the planets have been produced in this way. However it has proved to be more effective to use the less elegant but much simpler and more accurate method of integrating the equations of motion by numerical techniques. The positions of the Moon and planets in the almanacs are now all computed in this way, but the old algebraic methods are still the most effective for most of the natural satellites. With the task of planetary theory development that had occupied celestial mechanics for 300 years now effectively solved, the main emphasis of the subject has changed dra- matically, with many problems of origin, evolution and stability now being studied. The stability of the Solar Sys- tem has long been of considerable interest, and recent numerical integrations suggest that the orbits of the major planets are stable for at least 845 million years (about 20% of the age of the Solar System), but the orbit of Pluto may be unstable over that time scale. Another problem that is now close to a full solution after more than a century of effort is to explain the origin of the KIRKWOOD GAPS in the ASTEROID BELT , which occur at certain distances from the Sun that correspond to commensurabilities of period with Jupiter. The explanation that was found for the gap at the 3:1 COMMENSURABILITY required the introduction of the concept of CHAOS into Solar System dynamics. Using a sophisticated combination of analytical and numerical methods, it was found that over a long period of time the orbital elements of an object at the commensurability could have occasional large departures (termed chaotic motion) from the small range of values expected from conventional analytical modelling of the motion. Subse- quent work suggests that the same mechanism can explain the widest gap at the 2:1 commensurability. Many other instances of chaos have been identified, and with them is the realization that the Solar System is not such a deter- ministic dynamical system as had been supposed. It is now realized that TIDAL EVOLUTION has been a major factor in adjusting the orbits of satellites, and modi- fying the spin rates of satellites and planets. There are many more occurrences of commensurabilities in the 77 C C AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 10:39 am Page 77"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Solar System, particularly among the satellites, than w ould be expected by chance. It has been shown that some of these could have been caused by orbital evolution due to tidal action, which would continue until a com- mensurability was encountered, whereupon the satellites w ould become trapped. A theory of shepherding satellites was proposed to explain the confinement of the narrow rings of Uranus, which were discovered by ground-based occultation observations. Subsequent images from the Voyager space- craft have discovered small satellites close to one of the r ings, and similar satellites close to one of Saturn’s narrow r ings, thus at least partially supporting the shepherding mechanism. Many other interesting problems of dynam- ics have arisen following the Voyager observations, such as the cause of the intricate structure of Saturn’s rings, which consist of hundreds of individual ringlets. Some of the fea- tures have been explained by resonances with the satel- lites, which can cause various effects such as clumping around a ring, and radial variations of density. Other fea- tures are possibly caused by small unseen satellites orbit- ing within the rings, but there are many features still to be explained, and no doubt many new dynamical mecha- nisms still to be discovered. celestial meridian Great circle on the CELESTIAL SPHERE that passes through the north and south celestial poles, together with the ZENITH and the NADIR . The term is usual- ly used to refer to that part of the circle which is above the observer’s horizon, intersecting it due north and due south. celestial pole Either of the two points on the CELESTIAL SPHERE that intersect with a projection of the Earth’s axis of rotation into space, and about which the sky appears to rotate. Because their position is dictated by the orientation of the Earth’s axis, the celestial poles are subject to the effects of PRECESSION . This causes them to slowly drift, describing a circle in the sky of radius 23º.5 (the inclina- tion of the Earth’s axis) over a period of some 25,800 y ears, the effect only being noticeable over a few decades. At present, the north celestial pole is within 1º of the star P olaris, which is known as the POLE STAR , but in 3000 BC the north Pole Star was THUBAN , in Draco and by AD 10,000 it will be DENEB . For an observer, the ALTITUDE of the celestial pole is always equal to their latitude. Celestial Police Name given themselves by the 24 astronomers who collaborated to search for a planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, as predicted by BODE ’ SLAW . They were first convened in 1800 by Franz v on ZACH , at Johann SCHRÖTER ’s observatory. Members of this international group, who also included Johann BODE , William HERSCHEL , Nevil MASKELYNE , Charles MESSIER and Wilhelm OLBERS , discovered three asteroids (Pallas, Juno and Vesta) between 1802 and 1807, after Giuseppe PIAZZI had found the first, Ceres, in 1801. celestial sphere Inside of an imaginary sphere, with the Earth at its centre, upon which all celestial bodies are assumed to be projected. The stars and planets are so far away that everything we see in the sky appears to be projected on to an enor- mous screen extending all around us, as if we were inside a gigantic planetarium. This is the illusion of the celestial sphere, half of which is always hidden from an observer on the Earth’s surface, but upon which we base our charts of the sky and against which we make our measurements. The illusion is so strong that the early astronomers postu- lated the existence of a crystal sphere of very great radius to which the stars were fixed. The most obvious behaviour of the celestial sphere is its apparent daily east to west rotation, due to the axial spin of the Earth. In the northern hemisphere we see some stars that never set – the CIRCUMPOLAR STARS ; they appear to turn about the polar point near to the bright star Polaris. There is, of course, a similar polar point in the southern hemisphere marked by the fifth magnitude star, \u0001 Octantis. The direction of the polar axis seems fixed in space, but it is in fact slowly drifting because of the effects of PRECESSION . Having recognized one easily observed direction within the celestial sphere, it is possible to define another – the celestial equator. This is a projection of the Earth’s equa- tor on to the celestial sphere, dividing the sky into two hemispheres and enabling us to visualize a set of small cir- cles similar to those of latitude on Earth, known as DECLI - NATION , which allow us to specify the position of an object in terms of angle above or below the celestial equator. RIGHT ASCENSION , the celestial equivalent of longitude, is based upon the Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun and is measured eastwards along the ECLIPTIC , the appar- ent path of the Sun through the constellations. For half of each year the Sun is in the northern hemisphere of the sky and for the other half it is in the southern hemisphere. On two dates each year, known as the EQUINOXES , it CENTAURUS ( GEN .

The constellation’s brightest star is ALPHA CENTAURI , a triple system that includes the red dwarf PROXIMA CENTAURI , the closest star to the Sun. \u0002 and \u0003 Cen act as pointers to Crux, the Southern Cross. An easy double is 3 Cen, with components of 4.6 and 6.1 divisible with small apertures. R Cen is a variable MIRA STAR , ranging between 5th and 12th magnitude in about 18 months. \u0004 Cen is the brightest globular cluster in the sky, so prominent that it was given a stellar designation by early observers. NGC 3766 and 5460 are open clusters for binoculars. NGC 5128 is a 7th- magnitude peculiar galaxy, also known as the radio source CENTAURUS A . NGC 3918 is a planetary nebula known as the Blue Planetary, resembling the planet Uranus in small telescopes. celestial meridian 78 C \u0001 celestial sphere A useful concept for describing positions of astronomical bodies.

This point on the celestial sphere, where the ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect, is called the FIRST POINT OF ARIES . This was an accurate description of its position thousands of years ago, but precession has now carried it into the constellation Pisces. Right ascension can be measured in angular terms. However, it is more common to use units of time (hours, minutes, seconds or hms ). Astronomers measure time by the rotation of the Earth relative to the stars, that is exactly 360º of axial rotation, rather than to the Sun. Their ‘sidere- al’ timescale has a day of 24 sidereal hours, which in terms of civil time, is 23 hours, 56 minutes and 4 seconds long. The beginning of the sidereal day is when the First P oint of Aries lies on the MERIDIAN , the great circle linking the north and south points and passing directly overhead. After 24 sidereal hours it will be in that position again. The right ascension figures work like the face of a clock so that when the first point of Aries is on the meridian the sidereal time is 0 h . At 1 h sidereal time the sky will have rotated 15º and stars this angle east of the First Point of Aries will then lie on the meridian. Apart from right ascension and declination, astronomers also use other systems of CELESTIAL COORDI - NATES to locate objects or points on the celestial sphere, dependent upon the particular application. Although the stars seem relatively fixed in position, the Sun, Moon and planets (apart from Pluto) move across the celestial sphere in a band of sky about 8º either side of the ecliptic. This belt of sky is known as the ZODIAC and is divided into 12 signs named after the constellations they contained at the time of the ancient Greeks. Celsius, Anders (1701–44) Swedish astronomer, best known for inventing the Centigrade temperature scale, now known as the CELSIUS scale. He took part in the 1736 expedition to Lapland organized by the French astronomer Pierre Louis Moreau de Maupertuis (1698–1759) to measure the length of a meridian arc. The results of this and a second expedition to Peru showed that the Earth is oblate. Celsius was a pioneer of stellar photometry, using a series of glass filters to measure the relative intensity of light from stars of different magni- tudes, and he was one of the first to realize that the auro- rae were related to Earth’s magnetic field.

Centaur Any of a group of planet-crossing objects in the outer planetary region that are classified as being ASTEROIDS , although it is likely that in nature they are actually large COMETS . Through to late 2001 more than 35 Centaurs had been discovered, taking the criterion for membership as a Neptune-crossing orbit (that is, perihelion distance less than 30 AU), implying that the Centaurs could not be classed as TRANS - NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS . At such great distances from the Sun, the temperature is extremely low and only the most volatile chemical constituents sublimate, making comet-like activity either totally absent or at least difficult to detect using Earth-based telescopes. Their faintness, coupled with their considerable helio- and geocentric distances, implies that all known Centaurs must be of substantial size (generally bigger than 50 km/30 mi). It is likely, however, that these are only the largest members of the ov erall population, with a much greater number of smaller objects awaiting identification. The origin of the Centaurs is suspected to be as members of the EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT , having coalesced there when the rest of the Solar System formed over 4.5 billion years ago; they are thought to have been inserted into their present unstable orbits during just the last million years or so. The dynamical instability of the Centaurs derives from the fact that they will inevitably make close approaches to one or another of the giant planets, and the severe gravitational perturbations that result will divert the objects in question on to different orbits. Some Centaurs will be ejected from the Solar System on hyperbolic paths; others may fall into the inner planetary region and so become extremely bright active comets. The fact that Centaurs show characteristics of both asteroids and comets leads to the convention for their naming. In Greek mythology the Centaurs were hybrid beasts, half-man and half-horse. The first Centaur object to be discovered was CHIRON , in 1977. The next was PHOLUS , in 1992. Others added since include (7066) Nessus, (8405) Asbolus, (10199) Chariklo and (10370) Hylonome.

The CDS was founded in 1972 as the Centre de Don- nées Stellaires, its main aim being to cross-identify star des- ignations in different catalogues – often the same object had a host of different catalogue identifications. Bibliographic references to objects were added, and SIMBAD was the result. By 2001 the database contained data for more than 2.25 million objects, and over 5 million references. centre of mass P osition in space for an object or collec- tion of objects at which the various masses involved act as though they were a single mass concentrated at that point. For an object in a uniform gravitational field it is the same as the centre of gravity. When two masses are linked by gravity, the centre of mass occurs on the line joining them at a distance from each object that is inversely proportional to the mass of that object. In this case the centre of mass is also called the BARYCENTRE . centrifugal force Apparent force that appears when an object is forced to move along a circular or curved path. The force is actually the result of the inertia of the object a ttempting to keep the object moving in a straight line. It is the reaction to the CENTRIPETAL FORCE . centripetal force F orce acting on an object that causes it to move along a circular or curved path. It produces an acceleration towards the centre of curvature of the path, and the reaction to this acceleration is experienced as the CENTRIFUGAL FORCE . Gravity provides the centripetal force on an orbiting body, and the magnetic field on electrons producing SYNCHROTRON RADIATION . Cepheid instability strip See INSTABILITY STRIP Cepheid variable Y ellow giant or supergiant pulsating V ARIABLE STAR , so called because the first variable of the type to be discovered was DELTA CEPHEI . Cepheids pulsate in a particularly regular manner. These stars have left the MAIN SEQUENCE and occupy, on the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM , a position to the right of the upper main sequence and to the left of the red g iants, termed the Cepheid INSTABILITY STRIP . Cepheids are passing through the first Instability Transition after leaving the main sequence. During this brief period in their lives, these stars oscil- late, alternately expanding and contracting so that in each c ycle a star may change in size by as much as 30%. These regular, rhythmic changes in size are accompanied by changes in luminosity. The surface temperature also changes in the course of each cycle of variations in brightness, being at its lowest when the star is at mini- mum and at its highest when the star is brightest. This temperature change may equal 1500 K for a typical Cepheid. A change in temperature also means a change in SPECTRAL TYPE , so that the star may be F2 at maxi- mum, becoming the later type, G2, at minimum, chang- ing in a regular manner as the temperature falls or rises. A Cepheid may continue to pulsate in this manner for a million years, which is a comparatively short time com- pared to the life span of a star. Most massive stars spend at least some time as Cepheid va r iables. Stars like Delta Cephei have amplitudes of around 0.5 mag. and periods usually not longer than 7 days; there are, however, Cepheids with larger amplitudes and longer periods, which form a separate subtype. This subtype includes the naked-eye stars 1 Carinae, \u0001 Doradus and \u0002 Pa v onis. The period of light changes is related to the average luminosity of the star. This means that the absolute magnitude of a Cepheid variable may be found by measuring the period of the light cycle. The apparent magnitude may be obtained directly. Once peri- od, apparent and absolute magnitude are known, it becomes possible to determine the distance to the star. Cepheids are visible in external galaxies, but their v alue as distance indicators is compounded by the fact that there are two types. Both follow a period–luminosity relationship, but their light-curves are different. First, there are the classical Cepheids, such as Delta Cephei itself, which are yellow supergiants of Population I. The second type, the W VIRGINIS STARS , are Population II stars found in globular clusters and in the centre of the Galaxy. In using Cepheids to determine distances it is necessary to know which type is being observed. At the time Cepheids were first used to determine distances it was not known that there were Cepheids with different peri- central meridian 80 C \u0001 Cepheid variable Their extremely regular light variations make Cepheids valuable standard candles: the longer the period from one maximum to the next, the greater the star’s intrinsic luminosity. As shown, the typical Cepheid light-curve shows a rapid rise to peak brightness, followed by a slower decline to minimum. CEPHEUS ( GEN . CEPHEI , ABBR . CEP ) C onstellation of the northern polar region, between Cassiopeia and Draco. It represents a mythological king, husband of Cassiopeia and father of ANDROMEDA . Its most celebrated star is \u0003 Cep, the prototype CEPHEID VARIABLE , a pulsating yellow supergiant varying between 3.5 and 4.4 with a period of 5.4 days; its variability was discovered in 1784 by John GOODRICKE . A wide bluish companion of mag. 6.3 makes it an attractive double for small telescopes or even binoculars. \u0001 Cep is another pulsating variable, though of much smaller amplitude (0.1 mag.) and far shorter period (4.6 hours); it is the prototype BETA CEPHEI STAR . \u0004 Cep is a pulsating red supergiant known as the GARNET STAR , range 3.4–5.1, period about 2 years. Another variable red supergiant, VV Cep, is one of the largest stars known, with an estimated diameter about that of Jupiter’s orbit. It va r ies semiregularly between mags. 4.8 and 5.4.

This resulted in erroneously apply- ing the value for type II to classical Cepheids. When this error was found, in 1952, the result was to double the size of the Universe. For periods of 3–10 days the light-curves of the two types closely resemble one another and classifi- cation is based on spectral differences. In particular, at certain phases, classical Cepheids exhibit calcium emis- sion, whereas W Virginis stars show hydrogen emission. The period–luminosity relationship means that the longer the period, the brighter the visual absolute magni- tude. A comparison of the curves shows that classical Cepheids are about one magnitude brighter than type II Cepheids. The light-curves may be arranged in groups, according to their shapes, which progressively become more pronounced in each group as the period lengthens. Most Cepheid light-curves fall into one of about 15 such divisions, each with a longer average period. They all fol- low a period–luminosity relationship, which commences with the RR LYRAE stars of very short period and, after a break, is continued by the MIRA STARS . This regular pro- g ression – the longer the period, the later the spectral type – is called the Great Sequence. A typical Cepheid would have a surface temperature varying between 6000 and 7500 K and an absolute luminosity that is ten thousand times that of the Sun. Since Cepheids are in a part of the Hertzsprung–Rus- sell diagram where changes occur, observations are direct- ed towards detecting changes in periods. Such changes are small but give information as to how stars progress through the instability strip; they can be detected by mak- ing series of observations separated by a few years. Cepheus See feature article C ˇ erenkov radiation Electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a transparent medium at a speed greater than the local speed of light in that medium (the speed of light in air or water is less than that in a vacuum). Radiation is emitted in a cone along the track of the particle. Cosmic rays ploughing into the Earth’s atmosphere produce C ˇ erenkov radiation, which can be detected at ground level. This type of radiation was discovered in 1934 by the Russian physicist Pavel C ˇ erenkov (1904–90). Ceres First ASTEROID to be discovered, on the opening day of the 19th century, hence it is numbered 1. Ceres, a MAIN - BELT ASTEROID , has a diameter of c .933 km ( c .580 mi), although it is not precisely spherical; it is the largest asteroid. Ceres’ mass, 8.7 \u0001 10 20 kg, represents about 30% of the bulk of the entire main belt, or about 1.2% of the mass of the Moon. Its average density, about 1.98 g/cm 3 , is less than that of most meteorites. Ceres rotates in about nine hours, its brightness showing little va ri a tion, which is indicative of a fairly uniform surface, thought to be powdery in nature. It lies close to the mid- dle of the main belt, at an average heliocentric distance of 2.77 AU. The possibility of a planet between Mars and Jupiter had been suggested in the early 1600s by Johannes KEPLER , and in the late 18th century BODE ’ SLAW was interpreted as implying the likely existence of such a body. In 1800 a group of European astronomers formed the so-called CELESTIAL POLICE , having the aim of discovering this purported planet. Before they could begin their search, however, Ceres was discovered by Giuseppe PIAZZI from Palermo, Sicily. Piazzi was checking Nicolas LACAILLE ’s catalogue of zodiacal stars when he found an uncharted body that moved over the subsequent nights. Piazzi wanted to call the object Ceres F erdinandea (Ceres is the goddess of fertility, the patron of Sicily, while Ferdinand was the name of the Italian king), but only the first part of that name was accepted by astronomers in other countries. Although he was prevented by illness from following it for an extended period, Piazzi’s observations allowed Ceres to be recovered late in 1801. It soon became apparent that it w as not large enough to be considered a major planet, and the rapid discovery of several other such objects in the following years, namely P ALLAS , JUNO and VESTA , added to this view. William HERSCHEL coined the term asteroid for these new objects; they are also termed minor planets. Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) Major optical observatory situated approximately 80 km (50 mi) east of La Serena, Chile, at an elevation of 2200 m (7200 ft). It is operated jointly by the ASSOCIA - TION OF UNIVERSITIES FOR RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY and the National Science Foundation as part of the NATIONAL OPTICAL ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORIES ; it is a sister obser- va tory to KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY . The largest telescope on the site is the 4-m (158-in.) Victor M. Blanco T elescope, commissioned in 1974 to complement its northern-hemisphere twin, the MAYALL TELESCOPE , but now being developed to complement SOAR, the SOUTH - ERN ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH TELESCOPE , scheduled to begin operation in 2003. CTIO is also home to 1.5-m (60-in.), 1.3-m (51-in.) and 1.0-m (40-in.) reflectors.

There in 1846 July, at the urging of John Couch ADAMS , who had calculated the theoretical position of a new planet from perturbations of Uranus, Challis initiated a rigor- ous search. He actually discovered Neptune on August 4, though he failed to recognize it as a planet before Johann GALLE and Heinrich D ’ ARREST of the Berlin Observatory announced the planet’s discovery, on 1846 September 23. Chamaeleon See feature article 81 C CETUS ( GEN . CETI , ABBR . CET ) F ourth-largest constellation, lying on the celestial equator south of Aries and Pisces.

Cetus represents the sea- monster from which ANDROMEDA w as saved by Perseus. The constellation’s most famous star is MIRA ( \u0004 Cet), the prototype long-period variable. \u0005 Cet is the most Sun-like of all the nearby single stars. M77, a 9th-magnitude face-on spiral some 50 million l.y. away, is the brightest of all the Seyfert galaxies. Because Cetus lies close to the ecliptic, planets can sometimes be found within its boundaries. BRIGHTEST STARS Name RA dec.

MOULTON , conceived the planetesimal hypothesis for the origin of the Solar Sys- tem, according to which a star passing through the solar neighbourhood caused the Sun to eject filaments of mate- r ial that condensed into planetesimals, which in turn accreted to form the major planets.

Chandler period 430-day period of variation in posi- tion of the Earth’s axis of rotation. This small movement of the geographic poles is known as the ‘Chandler wob- ble’ after the American who first discovered it. It is thought to be caused by seasonal changes in the distribu- tion of mass within the Earth. Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan (1910–95) Indian- American astrophysicist who was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics for his mathematical theory of black holes. At Cambridge University, he developed a the- oretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter. He showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1.44 times that of the Sun – the CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT . Stars more massive than this must end their lives as a NEUTRON STAR or BLACK HOLE . He spent most of his career at the University of Chicago and its Yerkes Observatory, where he was on the faculty from 1937 to 1995, and he served as editor of the presti- g ious Astrophysical Journal (1952–71). Chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics originated by Jan OORT and others by considering the effects of fluctuating gravitational fields within the Milky Wa y on stars rotating about the galactic centre. His solu- tion to this complex dynamical problem involved a set of twenty partial differential equations, describing a new quantity he termed ‘dynamical friction’, which has the dual effects of decelerating the star and helping to stabilize clusters of stars. Chandrasekhar extended this analysis to the interstellar medium, showing that clouds of galactic gas and dust are distributed very unevenly. He also stud- ied general relativity and black holes, which he modelled using two parameters – mass and angular momentum. Chandrasekhar limit Maximum possible mass for a WHITE DWARF . It was first computed, in 1931, by the Indi- an astrophysicist Subrahmanyan CHANDRASEKHAR . The v alue computed by Chandrasekhar applies to a slowly rotating star composed primarily of helium nuclei and is about 1.44 solar masses. A white dwarf is supported against its own gravitational a ttraction by electron degeneracy pressure (see DEGENER - AT EM A TTER ). The PA ULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE states that no two electrons can occupy exactly the same state so that when all the low energy states have been filled, electrons are forced to take up higher energy states. With white dwarfs of progressively higher mass, as gravity attempts to squeeze the star into a smaller volume, so the electrons are forced into higher and higher energy states. They there- fore move around with progressively higher speeds, exert- ing progressively higher pressures. The greater the mass, the smaller the radius and the higher the density attained by a white dwarf before elec- tron degeneracy pressure stabilizes it against gravity. As the mass approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, electrons are eventually forced to acquire velocities close to the speed of light (that is, they become ‘relativistic’). As the limit is reached, the pressure exerted by relativistic elec- trons in a shrinking star cannot increase fast enough to counteract gravity. Gravity overwhelms electron degener- acy pressure, and a star that exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit collapses to a much denser state. Electrons combine with protons to form neutrons, and the collapse is eventu- ally halted by neutron degeneracy pressure, by which time the star has become a NEUTRON STAR . Chandrasekhar–Schönberg limit See SCHÖNBERG – CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT Chandra X-Ray Observatory (CXO) Third of NASA’s GREAT OBSERVATORY series. The former Advanced X-Ray Astrophysics Facility, it was deployed into orbit by the Space Shuttle Columbia in 1999 July.

It followed the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE and the COMPTON GAMMA RAY OBSERVA - TORY in the Great Observatory series.

It is important to note that the term chaos describes a property of the mathematical model, not of the outcome of the model, which in the meteorological case is still just normal weather. In CELESTIAL MECHANICS the term has become very popular, and is used with various shades of meaning in different contexts. One of these is the problem of pre- dicting the orbit of an object, such as an asteroid, that has a very close approach or repeated close approaches to a planet. The initial orbit has inevitable uncertainties due to limitations of the accuracy and coverage of posi- tional observations, and these uncertainties are magni- fied greatly following a close approach to a planet, to the extent that the orbit after the close approach can be com- pletely uncertain, or more likely that it is sufficiently uncertain that it cannot be used for predicting subse- quent close approaches. Another context in which the term arises is in the study of orbits at a COMMENSURABILITY . There are usual- ly multiple resonant terms at a commensurability, associ- a ted with the eccentricity and inclination of each object. In analytical studies it is necessary to simplify the prob- lem and to pick out just the single dominant term. How- ever numerical integrations over long time spans show that in some cases the effects of the overlapping reso- nances can result in changes to the orbit that cannot be predicted by the analytical study. The nature of these changes is usually an increase in the eccentricity of the orbit, which could perhaps lead to a close approach to a planet causing the ejection of the body from the com- mensurability. This mechanism is a likely explanation of the KIRKWOOD GAPS at the 3:1 and 2:1 commensurabili- ties with Jupiter. charge-coupled device See CCD Charlier, Carl Vilhelm Ludvig (1862–1934) Swedish astronomer who worked at the University of Uppsala, Stockholm Observatory and the University of Lund, where he directed the observatory for thirty years. He made many detailed studies of the distribution and motions of stars and star clusters near the Sun, finding that the Milky Way was shaped like a disk, and rotated. Charlier proposed a hierarchical grouping of galaxies in an infinite universe. Charon Only known SATELLITE of PLUTO . It was discov- ered on telescopic images by the American astronomer J ames Christy (1938– ) in 1978. Charon is named after the ferryman who, in classical mythology, transported the ghosts of the dead across the river Styx into the under- w orld domain of the god Pluto. It is a mysterious body, never having been visited by any spacecraft. The determination of Charon’s orbit gave the first reli- able measurement of Pluto’s mass. Between 1985 and 1990, a fortunate series of mutual OCCULTATIONS between Pluto and Charon, when the plane of Charon’s orbit lay in the line of sight from Earth, enabled the sizes of both bod- ies to be determined. Charon orbits exactly in Pluto’s equatorial plane, and the rotations of the two bodies are mutually tidally locked so that they permanently keep the same faces toward each other. Spectroscopic studies of Charon have revealed only wa ter-ice, contaminated by rock or soot, with none of the more exotic ices found on Pluto. Charon’s gravity is too w eak to retain any kind of atmosphere, even in the cold outer reaches of the Solar System, where the surface tem- perature is only about 40 K. Competing tidal pulls on Charon from Pluto and the Sun could be responsible for sufficient TIDAL HEATING to have allowed Charon to dif- ferentiate ( see DIFFERENTIATION ), forming a rocky core, and even to maintain an ocean below the outer carapace of ice.

Chinese astronomy Astronomy as practised in the Chinese empire from ancient times until the overthrow of the last imperial dynasty in 1911. Ancient Chinese astronomical records of eclipses and other unusual events in the sky date from as early as 1500 BC and formed part of the royal archives. Rulers could be made or unmade by portents from heaven, which explains their concern with celestial matters. Of particular con- cern were solar and lunar eclipses, and other transient phenomena such as novae and supernovae (‘guest stars’), comets, auroras and conjunctions of the Moon and planets. Official astrologers or tianwen had to explain any unusual celestial event and, if possible, fore- wa rn of its occurrence. Other officials, called lifa , dealt with the predictable parts of astronomy needed for cal- endrical studies. The latter made observations, kept records and developed mathematical models. China experienced a violently unsettled period in the 3rd century BC and many early records were destroyed. However, by about 206 BC , the commencement of the Han Dynasty, a single calendar was in use everywhere. A luni-solar scheme was in use, with a correction of seven extra months in 19 years, according to the METONIC CYCLE , to keep pace with the seasons. Refinements were made from time to time, and the predictive powers of the almanacs were continuously improved. An interesting achievement of Han astronomers was to record in detail the passage of Halley’s Comet through the constellations during its 12 BC apparition. In contrast to early Western astronomy, the Chinese astronomers did not emphasize the zodiac. Instead, there w ere 28 unequally spaced ‘lunar mansions’ close to the celestial equator. Their constellations were small and ve ry numerous, and almost completely different from the Western ones. Observations making use of an instrument – the ARMILLARY SPHERE – were made as early as 52 BC . The imperial bureaucracy later encouraged the construction of observatories and the compilation of star catalogues. An engraved Song Dynasty (960–1277) star map survives from AD 1247 in a temple in Jiangsu province, containing 1440 stars with a typical positional accuracy of 1º. In the early 17th century, Western influences began to arrive with Jesuit missionaries such as Matteo Ricci (1552–1610), and after the fall of the last imperial dynasty Chinese astronomy became aligned with that of the out- side world. The ancient Chinese records have proved use- ful for, among other things, establishing the ages of supernovae that were not recorded in the West; the super- n ova of AD 1054 that led to the formation of the Crab Pul- sar and the Crab Nebula is a notable example. Chiron An outer Solar System body, c .180 km ( c .110 mi) in diameter, given dual ASTEROID and COMET designations as (2060) Chiron and 95P/Chiron respec- tively. Its orbit, with a period of just over 50 years, has perihelion near 8.4 AU and aphelion at 18.8 AU. Chiron, therefore, crosses the path of Saturn and also approaches Uranus; consequently it is dynamically unstable. Over a time scale of order a million years (that is, much less than the age of the Solar System) it is to be expected that Chi- ron’s orbit will change radically. It was the first object to be discovered in a class of bodies known as the CEN - TA URS , these being characterized as large objects inhabit- ing the outer planetary region and having rapidly evolving orbits. When found, in 1977 by Charles Kowal (1940– ), Chiron appeared asteroidal in nature, but as its heliocentric distance decreased, passing perihelion in 1996 F ebruary, it began to develop characteristics associated with comets. In 1988 Chiron rapidly brightened, indicating the formation of some type of cometary coma; in the following years it developed a surrounding cloud of dust, and then the emission of cyanogen gas and other v olatiles was detected. It is generally regarded as an escaped member of the EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT that has migrated inwards towards the Sun.

He was also a pioneer of meteoritics, the study of meteorites, which he was convinced were of extraterrestrial origin – a novel idea at the time. He assembled the first great col- lection of meteorites. chondrite Most primitive and oldest of the METEORITES . Chondrites are STONY METEORITES that have not melted since their aggregation early in the histo- ry of the Solar System. They are mostly characterized by the presence of CHONDRULES , which are millimetre-sized spherules of rapidly cooled silicate melt droplets. On the basis of chemistry, chondrites are subdivided into three main groups, the CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITES (C), ORDINARY CHONDRITES (O) and ENSTATITE CHONDRITES (E). There are also two smaller classes, the Rumurutiites (R) and the Kakangari (K), each represented by only a single example. The groups have different oxygen iso- tope compositions, matrix, metal and chondrule con- tents and chondrule properties (such as size, type, and so on). The differences between the classes are primary, that is, they were established as the parent bodies accret- ed in different regions of the SOLAR NEBULA . In addition to these chemical classes, the chondrites are classified according to the processing that they have experienced, either thermal metamorphism or aqueous alteration.

Chondrules normally consist of olivine and/or p yroxene, with a variety of textures, depending on the starting materials and the cooling regimen. Pyroxene- r ich chondrules are often composed of crystallites radiat- ing from a point offset from the centre of the sphere; olivine-rich chondrules frequently have a blocky or barred appearance. The term ‘chondrule’ comes from the Greek chondros , meaning grain or seed. The origin of chondrules is still not known with certainty. At one time, they were thought to be fused drops of ‘fiery rain’ from the Sun. Other theories include that they were formed by the cooling of droplets produced by collisions between asteroids, or by direct condensation from a gas. Alterna- tively, chondrules might have formed by melting and subsequent quenching of small aggregates of dust grains in the pre-solar nebula; the heat source for such melting might have been shock waves in the nebula or energetic outflow from the Sun. Christie, William Henry Mahoney (1845–1922) Eng- lish astronomer, the eighth ASTRONOMER ROYAL (1881–1910), who substantially improved the equipment at Greenwich Observatory, especially by acquiring the 28- inch (0.71-m) refractor. Christie was responsible for sever- al important star catalogues produced by the Observatory, bu t he extended the observatory’s work to include physical as well as positional astronomy, supervising programmes of photographic and spectroscopic stellar astronomy. With E. Walter MAUNDER he initiated daily sunspot observations which led to discoveries about solar activity. chromatic aberration Introduction of false colour into images formed by a lens. When light passes through a lens, it is bent or refracted. The degree of bending depends on the colour or wavelength of the light, so differ- ent colours follow different paths. The consequence is that the different colours in any image formed by the lens come to a focus at different points. This is chromatic aberration. It was a serious drawback in the first refracting telescopes. In a telescope, chromatic aberration appears as coloured fringes around the edges of objects. Chromatic aberration can be reduced or eliminated by using an A CHROMAT or an APOCHROMAT . chromosphere Layer or region of the solar atmosphere lying above the PHOTOSPHERE and beneath the CORONA . The name chromosphere comes from the Latin meaning ‘sphere of colour’. The term is also used for the layer above the photosphere of a star. The Sun’s temperature r ises to about 10,000–20,000 K in the chromosphere. The chromosphere is normally invisible because of the glare of the photosphere, but it can often be seen near the beginning and end of a TO TA L SOLAR ECLIPSE when it is visible as a spiky pink or red rim around the Moon’s disk at the limb or edge of the Sun. Today, the chromos- phere can be observed at any time across the full solar disk with a SPECTROGRAPH or SPECTROHELIOGRAPH that isolates a single colour of the Sun’s light – for example, the red light of the HYDROGEN - ALPHA LINE (H-alpha) at a wavelength of 656.3 nm, or the violet light of ionized calcium, Ca II, at wavelengths of 396.8 and 393.4 nm, known as the calcium H and K lines. The monochromat- ic image made with a spectrograph is known as a SPEC - TROGRAM or spectroheliogram. Spectrograms show features such as FIBRILS , FILAMENTS , FLOCCULI , PLAGES and PROMINENCES . A large cellular pattern, known as the chromospheric network , is also revealed in spectrohe- liograms. It appears at the boundaries of the photos- phere SUPERGRANULATION , and contains magnetic fields that have been swept to the edges of these cells by the flow of material in the cell. A thin TRANSITION REGION separates the CHROMOSPHERE and the CORONA . SPICULES containing chromospheric material penetrate well into the corona (to heights of 10,000 km/6000 mi above the photosphere) at the edges of the cells. chromospheric network See CHROMOSPHERE chronometer See MARINE CHRONOMETER Chryse Planitia Extensive plains region on MARS ; it was the site of the VIKING 1 Lander probe. Centred near 27º.0N 40º.0W, it was shown by the Lander to consist of loose reddish material upon which were distributed large numbers of blocks of basaltic lava. Chryse occupies a large basin-like embayment into the cratered terrain of Mars, probably the infilled site of an ancient impact basin. A large number of prominent channels converge on the region. These channels have their origin in the eastern end of V ALLES MARINERIS and are of presumed fluvial origin. Recent altimetry and imaging data from MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR strongly suggest that the whole region from Chryse to the eastern end of Valles Mariner- is was once flooded. Circinus See feature article circular velocity V elocity of a body in a circular orbit around a massive primary. Its value is given by GM / R , where M is the mass of the primary, R is the radius of the orbit and G is the gravitational constant. For the Earth the circular velocity ranges from about 7.8 km/s (4.8 mi/s) for the lowest artificial satellites, to 3.1 km/s (1.9 mi/s) for satellites in geosynchronous orbit, and to 1.0 km/s (0.6 mi/s) for the Moon. See also ESCAPE VELOCITY circumpolar star Star that never sets below the observ- er’s horizon. For a star to be circumpolar at a given lati- tude its declination must be greater than 90º minus that latitude. For example, if the observer’s latitude is 52º, by subtracting 52º from 90º we get 38º. Any star with a decli- nation greater then 38º will therefore be circumpolar for that observer. At the equator, no stars are circumpolar whereas at the poles, all visible stars are circumpolar. circumstellar matter Material in the form of gas, dust or larger solid particles in close proximity to a star. Such mate- r ial can form through several different processes and at sev- eral different stages of a star’s life.

Almost all stars may be expected to be surrounded by circumstellar matter during and immediately after their formation. The collapse to a PROTOSTAR will leave material behind in the form of a fla ttened envelope surr ounding the star and a more amorphous gas cloud further out. Condensation of the more refractory elements and com- pounds within the envelope may lead to the formation of dust particles ( see BETA PICTORIS ). These particles may then collide and stick together, building up to larger and larger sizes, and eventually perhaps forming PLANETS . The young star usually starts to expel material at velocities of a few hundred kilometres per second ( see STELLAR WIND ). Although the material is probably initially emitted isotropically, the surrounding equatorially concentrated envelope restricts the outflow to directions around the rotational poles of the protostar, resulting in BIPOLAR FLOWS and HERBIG – HARO OBJECTS . The stellar wind even- tually evaporates the circumstellar envelope and brings a halt to planetary formation, if it is occurring. This process may explain why Uranus and Neptune are smaller than Jupiter and Saturn, since the protosun may have evaporat- ed the remaining circumsolar material just as they were being formed. The EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT and the OORT CLOUD are the last remnants of this material that once surrounded the Sun. With the evaporation of the dense circumstellar material close to the star, the ultraviolet radiation from the more massive stars can then penetrate into the surrounding lower density nebula producing HII REGIONS ( see also COSMOGONY ). To w ards the end of the lives of solar-mass stars the outer layers of the star become unstable and are expelled at veloc- ities of a few kilometres per second. The expelled material forms a cloud around the star up to a light-year across; it is heated by the ultraviolet radiation from the star. The result- ing glowing material may then be seen as a PLANETARY NEBULA . Subsequent higher velocity winds from the central star may sweep the centre of the nebula clear of material to produce a spherical shell that can be seen projected on to the sky as a ring ( see RING NEBULA ). The rotation of the star, its magnetic fields or a binary central star may lead to bipolar and many other shapes for the planetary nebulae. Circumstellar material also arises within CLOSE BINARY stars, when one star is losing mass to form an A CCRETION DISK around the other. It also arises as the stellar winds from MIRA VARIABLES , W OLF - RAYET and other hot stars, as dust particles around carbon stars and red giants, as the regions producing emission lines within the spectra of P CYG , Be ( see GAMMA CASSIOPEIAE STAR ), TTA URI STARS and so on.

Clementine J oint project between the US Strategic Defense Initiative and the NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA). The objective of the mission was to test sensors and spacecraft components under extended exposure to the space environment and to make scientific observations of the MOON and the near-Earth asteroid 1620 GEOGRAPHOS . The observations included imaging at var ious wavelengths, including ultra- violet and infrared, laser ranging altimetry and charged- particle measurements. Clementine was launched on 1994 January 25. After two Earth flybys, the spacecraft entered orbit around the Moon four weeks later. Lunar mapping, which took place over approximately two months, was divided into two phases. During the first month, Clementine was in a 5-hour elliptical polar orbit with a perilune (point at which it was closest to the Moon) of about 400 km (250 mi) at 28ºS latitude. The orbit was then rotated to a perilune at 29ºN, where it remained for one more month. This allowed the entire surface of the Moon to be mapped for the first time, as well as altimetry cover- age from 60ºS to 60ºN. Near-infrared and ultraviolet measurements provided the best maps of surface com- position and geology yet obtained. Clementine data also indicated the presence of water ice in deep craters close to the lunar poles. After leaving lunar orbit, a malfunction in one of the on-board computers occurred on May 7, causing a thruster to fire until it had used up all of its fuel. This left the spacecraft spinning out of control and meant that the planned flyby of Geographos had to be abandoned.

Because of this proximity, most close binaries are SPECTROSCOPIC BINARIES and/or ECLIPSING BINARIES . MASS TRANSFER occurs at some stage in most close binaries, profoundly affecting the evolution of the component stars. If the two components in a close binary do not fill their R OCHE LOBES , the system is a detached binary. In a semidetached binary one star fills its Roche lobe and mass transfer occurs. In a CONTACT BINA - RY both stars fill their Roche lobes. The evolution of close binaries depends on the initial masses of the two stars and their separation. The more massive star will evolve into a RED GIANT and fill its Roche lobe; material will spill through the inner LAGRANGIAN POINT on to its companion, thereby affecting its compan- ion’s evolution. The mass transfer can also alter the sepa- ration and orbital period of the binary star. In binaries that are initially widely separated, material escaping from the Roche lobe of the evolved red giant immerses the system in material, creating a common envelope binary that contains the core of the red giant (a WHITE DWARF ) and the companion star. Frictional forces cause the two components to approach, and thus the orbital period shortens. The common envelope is ejected and a CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE is left, in which the mass transfer from the companion on to the white dwarf causes the periodic outbursts seen in NOVAE , RECURRENT NOVAE , DW ARF NOVAE and SYMBIOTIC STARS . If one component of a close binary is massive enough, it may become a NEUTRON STAR or BLACK HOLE . Such binary systems are observed ( see X - RAY BINARIES ), but often a supernova explosion will blow the system apart into separate single stars. closed universe Solution of Einstein’s equations of GENERAL RELATIVITY in which the mass density of the Universe exceeds the CRITICAL DENSITY .

Refractive-index-matching materials such as magne- sium fluoride are often applied to lenses to reduce the light reflected from their surfaces, thus increasing the amount transmitted. This is sometimes called blooming because the slow accumulation of dirt on early, uncoated optics resembled the bloom on a plum or grape, and it was noticed that the bloom improved the transmission of the optics. Multi-layer coatings are often used to produce more effective anti-reflection coatings.

It is crossed by obscuring lanes of dark material. coelostat Tw o-mirror system that tracks motion of a celestial object, most usually the Sun, across the sky and allows light from it to be reflected into a fixed instrument. A coelostat consists of a pair of plane mirrors, one of which is rotated by a motor east to west about a polar axis at half the Earth’s rotation rate, thus counteracting the diurnal movement of the sky. Light from this mirror is reflected to a second, fixed mirror, which in turn directs the beam in a fixed direction, resulting in an image that is both stationary and non-rotating. Apparatus too heavy to be attached to a telescope, for example a SPECTROHELIO - GRAPH , may then be positioned to receive these reflected rays. The primary characteristic of the coelostat, which distinguishes it from the similar heliostat, is that the image it produces is non-rotating. Coelostats are often used in solar observatories, mount- ed at the top of a tower with instruments such as spectro- g raphs placed at the bottom, or even underground. This arrangement allows long focal lengths to be achieved, enabling high-dispersion spectra of the Sun to be pro- duced.

Flattened rotation curves of galaxies, and the velocities of stars at different distances from the centre of the galaxy, led astronomers to believe there was more mass present in the HALOES of galaxies than was being seen. Mass in the form of BARYONS , or AXIONS , was proposed as this cold dark component of galaxies. This matter might also provide enough mass to close the Universe ( see CLOSED UNIVERSE ). Recent measurements of the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND and BROWN DWARFS in galactic haloes have reduced the need to invoke dark matter to account for missing mass. See also MISSING MASS PROBLEM collapsar Obsolete name for a BLACK HOLE collimation Process of aligning the optical elements of a telescope. Certain sealed instruments, such as refractors, are generally collimated at the factory and need never be adjusted, but most telescopes with mirrors do require occasional re-alignment, especially amateur Newtonian telescopes built with Serrurier trusses where the sec- ondary and focuser assembly are routinely separated from the primary for transport. The procedure for collimating a Newtonian telescope is usually carried out in two steps, first aligning the primary to direct light to the centre of the secondary, then adjusting the secondary to direct the light cone down the centre of the focuser.

An example of a collisionless process is the formation of the BOW SHOCK between the SOLAR WIND and INTERSTELLAR MATTER . colour index Difference in brightness of a star as mea- sured at different wavelengths; it is used as a measure of the colour of the star. The different wavelengths are isolat- ed by optical filters of coloured glass (for example blue and red) and light passing through each is expressed in magnitudes (B and R). The colour index B-R is zero for white stars (spectral type A0). It ranges from about \u0001 0.5 for the bluest stars to more than \u0002 2.0 for the reddest. Colour index correlates well with the naked-eye per- ception of the colour of the brighter stars (the colour of fainter stars is hard to perceive for reasons to do with the physiology of the eye and the psychology of perception). Colour index is principally a measurement of the tem- perature of stars. The bluest stars are hotter than 30,000 K, white stars have surfaces at temperatures of about 10,000 K. The reddest stars are very cool, say 3000 K. Cooler stars exist but emit so little light that they may best be studied by INFRARED techniques. The colour index of light from a star may be changed as the light passes through interstellar space. Dust in space interacts more easily with the blue light from the star and disturbs the blue light from its straight path (scattering). Red light passes relatively freely around the dust and carries straight on to the observer’s telescope. Thus the starlight is reddened (it would be more accurate to say ‘de-blued’). The consequent increase of the star’s colour index caused by the INTERSTELLAR DUST is called a colour excess due to INTERSTELLAR REDDENING . The colour index of stars is also modified by the pres- ence of atoms in their atmospheres. The light in different wa v ebands is affected to different degrees. It is possible to isolate the various effects by measuring the colour index between different pairs of wavelengths. A colour index formed with ultraviolet and with blue light (U-B) may be compared with (B-R) in a colour–colour plot. The posi tion of a star in the plot gives clues about its chemical compo- sition, temperature and interstellar reddening. The colour index is also used for Solar System bodies and can give clues about their mineral compositions. colour–magnitude diagram Plot of the MAGNITUDE of a collection of stars versus their COLOUR INDEX .

Simple reflecting telescopes such as the NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE sometimes use a parabolic mirror to collect light and form an image. A perfect parabola will produce a perfect image in the centre of the field of view, that is, on its optical axis, and images close to the centre will also be very sharp. However, as the distance from the optical axis increases, the images start to grow tails pointing away from the centre. Eliminating these tails requires at least one extra optical component.

M64 is the BLACK EYE GALAXY , and NGC 4565 is an edge-on spiral galaxy about 20 million l.y. away. Several members of the VIRGO CLUSTER of galaxies can be found in Coma, most notably the face-on spiral M100; it also contains the more distant COMA CLUSTER . \u0001 Coma Cluster This rich galaxy cluster, probably containing more than 1000 members, lies 350 million l.y. away. As in other such clusters, the most prominent members are giant elliptical galaxies.

Sublimation of frozen gases leads to development of a temporary atmosphere, or COMA , surrounding the nucleus. New comets, or known PERIODIC COMETS returning to PERIHELION , are usually found at this stage, as fluorescence in the coma causes them to brighten and appear as a teardrop-shaped fuzzy spot. As a comet approaches the Sun more closely, a T AIL or tails may form. Brighter comets often show a straight ion tail (type I) and a curved dust tail (type II). Enveloped in the coma, the nucleus is not directly visible to Earth-based tele- scopes, but a bright spot may mark its position, and jets of material can be seen emerging from it in the brightest and most active comets. The occurrence of such features indi- cates that much of the gas emission from a comet comes from persistent active regions, which may cover 15–20% of the nucleus. As the nucleus rotates, active regions are alter- nately ‘turned on’ by solar heating or abruptly shut down as they are carried into shadow. Such behaviour led to the dis- tinctive spiral structure in the coma of C/1995 O1 HALE – BOPP . Intermittent gas and dust emission can pro- duce other features, including hoods and shells in the coma. The whole comet may be enveloped in a vast tenuous cloud of hydrogen, detectable at ultraviolet wavelengths from spacecraft. Gas jets emerging from the nucleus carry aw ay dust particles, which depart on parabolic trajectories to form a curved dust tail. Dust tails appear yellowish, the colour of reflected sunlight as confirmed by spectroscopy. The dust particles appear to be silicate grains, some 10 micrometres in size. Bigger flakes of dusty material, per- haps a few millimetres in size, are also carried away; in large numbers, these METEOROIDS can end up pursuing a common orbit around the Sun as a METEOR STREAM . Comets’ tails point away from the Sun. Under certain cir- cumstances, however, thin sheets of ejected dusty material may appear to point towards the Sun from the coma, forming an ANTITAIL , as a result of perspective. Gas emerging from the nucleus is rapidly ionized by solar ultraviolet radiation. Positively charged ions are picked up by the interplanetary magnetic field in the SOLAR WIND and dragged away from the coma to form an ion tail (also commonly described as a plasma tail). In contrast with the dust tail, a comet’s ion tail appears rela- tively straight and may show a marked bluish colour, which results from emissions at 420 nm wavelength, char- acteristic of carbon monoxide (CO) excitation. The ion tail can exhibit knots and twists resulting from changes in the interplanetary magnetic field in the comet’s vicinity; reversals of the field’s polarity can result in complete shearing of the ion tail – a DISCONNECTION EVENT – after which a new, differently oriented ion tail may develop. Comas and ion tails show emission spectra characteris- tic of a number of molecular species comprising combina- tions of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, such as water (H 2 O), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and radicals such as cyanogen (CN) and h ydroxyl (OH). Methane (CH 4 ) and ammonia (NH 3 ) are certainly present but are difficult to detect. When a comet is very close to the Sun, metallic emissions (particularly from sodium) occur; observations of C/1995 O1 Hale–Bopp in 1997 revealed the presence of a third, dis- tinct sodium tail. Although comets can be ejected from the Solar System, never to return, on hyperbolic trajectories following plane- tary encounters, none has yet been shown to enter from interplanetary space: the comets that we observe are grav- itationally bound to the Sun. A vast reservoir of cometary nuclei, the OORT CLOUD , surrounds the Solar System to a distance of 100,000 AU. Perturbations by passing stars or g iant molecular clouds in the course of the Sun’s orbit around the Galaxy can cause Oort cloud nuclei to fall inwards. There is strong evidence that such nuclei accu- mulate in a flattened disk – the EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT – at a distance of up to 1000 AU. From this region, further perturbations may lead nuclei to plunge inwards to peri- helion as new long-period comets. Close encounter with one of the planets, particularly Jupiter, can dramatically alter the comet’s orbit, changing some bodies from long- to short-period comets. The division between short- and long-period comets is set purely arbitrarily at an orbital duration (perihelion to perihelion) of 200 years. Most comets have narrow ellipti- cal orbits, which may be either direct or retrograde; 1P/Halley, for example, has a 76-year retrograde orbit. Comet 2P/ ENCKE has the shortest period, of 3.3 years. In total, some 150 short-period comets are known. Comets lose material permanently at each perihelion passage and must eventually become defunct; the lifetimes of short-period comets are probably of the order of 10,000 years. The ultimate fate of a short-period comet appears to vary. Some disperse entirely into a diffuse cloud of dust and gas. Comet nuclei are fragile and may break into smaller fragments close to perihelion. Others, depleted of volatile material, may simply become inert, leaving a dark asteroid-like core with no tail activity. The brightness of a comet is expressed as the equiva- lent stellar magnitude, as in the case of nebulae. Most comets show fadings and outbursts caused mainly by va r ying nuclear jet activity and solar effects. Predicting the apparent brightness of comets is notoriously difficult. It does appear that proximity to the Sun is a more significant factor than closeness to Earth. Comets are usually at their most active and, therefore, brightest just after perihelion. Comets are normally named after those who discover them, up to a maximum of three names. In some cases – increasingly common early in the 21st century – comet discovery by automated telescopes or spacecraft is reflect- ed in their names, examples including the many named after LINEAR or SOHO . Some, notably 1P/Halley, 2P/Encke and 27P/ CROMMELIN , are named after the analyst who first determined their orbit. Short-periodic comets are identified by the prefix P/ and a number indicating the cometary globule 90 C \u0001 comet Radiation pressure and solar wind effects result in a comet’s tail always pointing away from the Sun. An interesting consequence of this is that a comet therefore departs the inner Solar System tail-first.

Defunct comets have the prefix D/, while long-period comets are denoted by C/. In addition to a name, long-period comets are iden- tified by the year and date order of their discovery. The year is divided into 26 fortnightly intervals for this pur- pose, starting with A and B for January, and so on. A comet designated C/2002 B2 would be the second discov- ery made in the latter fortnight of 2002 January. In most years, perhaps 25 comets become sufficiently bright to be observed with amateur telescopes. Spectacu- lar naked-eye comets are rare and unpredictable: the brightest are usually new discoveries, making one of their first visits to the inner Solar System. The more pre- dictable, short-period comets tend to be fainter, having already lost some of their volatile material. Among the brightest comets have been the KREUTZ SUNGRAZERS . It has been speculated that the frequency of truly bright ‘great’ comets has been remarkably low in recent times compared with, say, the late 19th century. Statistically, however, the 20-year gap between C/1975 V1 WEST and C/1996 B2 HYAKUTAKE is not atypical. The next spectac- ular comet may appear at any time. cometary globule Fan-shaped REFLECTION NEBULA that is usually closely associated with a pre-main-sequence star, such as a TTA URI STAR . The globule’s appearance can superficially resemble that of a comet, but the two types of object are quite unrelated. There may be a bright rim to the ‘head’, and the ‘tail’ can be several light-years in length. Other recognized shapes for cometary globules include: an arc; a ring, sometimes with a star at the centre or on the rim; a biconical (hourglass) nebula with star at the ‘waist’; and a linear wisp protruding from a star. Most cometaries shine by reflecting the light of their allied star, though some are ionized by the ultraviolet radiation of hot central stars ( see HII REGION ). The heads of globules are denser regions within a larg- er nebula. The ultraviolet radiation and STELLAR WIND from the associated star ionizes the gases on the outer sur- face of the globule causing it to glow, so producing the bright rim around the head. The gas and radiation pres- sure also drives away surrounding material to leave the dark tail formed of nebula material sheltered by the head. Recently, the biconical type of nebula has been general- ized to include any bipolar system that consists of two sep- arate nebulae with a star lying between. Enlarging the class to incorporate the bipolar nebulae makes cometary glob- ules evolutionarily less homogeneous. The subclass of bipolar nebulae are not all indications of stellar youth: some RED GIANTS lose mass by a BIPOLAR FLOW , thereby generating bipolar nebulae. The stars associated with cometary globules are often embedded within dusty equatorial disks, which are some- times thick enough to render the stars optically invisible. Bright infrared sources are observed instead, which are the result of emission from the dust. The various cometary globule shapes may all be explained as viewing from different directions the basic model of a star plus a dust disk, with the disk constraining the star’s light to shine into a bicone. See also HUBBLE ’ SV ARIABLE NEBULA commensurability There are many cases of pairs of planets or satellites whose orbital periods are close to the ratio of two small integers, and these are called ‘commen- surabilities’. They cause greatly increased PERTURBATIONS between the two bodies by a RESONANCE effect, and it is a major challenge of CELESTIAL MECHANICS to calculate these perturbations and the resulting effects on the orbits. The principal examples among the planets are the 5:2 commensurability between Jupiter and Saturn, 3:1 between Saturn and Uranus, 2:1 between Uranus and Neptune, and 3:2 between Neptune and Pluto. For Nep- tune and Pluto the commensurability is very close, and a special type of motion called a LIBRATION occurs. This prevents the two planets ever coming near to each other, even though their orbits cross, because they are never at that part of their orbits at the same time. A similar effect occurs at the outer part of the ASTER - OID BELT . The Hilda group of asteroids at the 3:2 com- mensurability with Jupiter, and the asteroid Thule at 4:3, can only remain in orbits so close to Jupiter because their commensurabilities protect them from close approaches. The TROJAN ASTEROIDS are an extreme example of this effect, as they move in the same orbit as Jupiter, but their 1:1 commensurabilities with Jupiter ensure that they remain far from Jupiter – close to 60º ahead or behind. There are many more commensurabilities in the satel- lite systems of the major planets than would be expected by chance, and there has been much recent effort to explain their origin. In the Jupiter system there is a com- plex commensurability involving the three satellites Io, Europa and Ganymede, which is a combination of two 2:1 commensurabilities. It is likely that this was formed by TIDAL EVOLUTION of the orbits due to the tides raised in Jupiter by the satellites, combined with the effect of energy dissipation of the tide raised in Io by Jupiter. In the Saturn system, the 2:1 commensurability between Mimas and Tethys, and that between Enceladus and Dione, were also probably caused by tidal evolution. The likely explanation of the 4:3 commensurability between Titan and Hyperion is that Hyperion is the sole survivor from many objects originally in the region, and its reso- nance has protected it from close approaches to Titan. There are also many effects of commensurabilities in the ring systems of the planets.

In the late 1870s he obtained a 36-inch (0.9-m) mirror from the English opti- cian George Calver (1834–1927) and designed and supervised the construction of a telescope and a rotating observatory to house the instrument. In 1880 Common took his first photographs with this telescope, and for the next five years he continued to improve his photographic technology.

Compton effect Loss of energy by, and consequent increase in wavelength of, a PHOTON that collides with an ELECTRON and imparts some of its energy to it. In the inverse Compton effect, the photon gains energy from the electron. Compton Gamma Ray Observatory Second of NASA’s GREAT OBSERVATORIES , launched from the Space Shuttle Atlantis on 1991 April 5. The observatory was named in honour of Arthur Holly Compton (1892–1962), who was awarded the Nobel Prize for physics for work on gamma-ray detection techniques. Its four instruments provided unprecedented coverage of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 30 keV to 30 GeV. The Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) was designed to detect short outbursts. The Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment (OSSE) studied the spectrum of gamma-ray sources. The Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) mapped the gamma- ray sky at medium energies, and the Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) made an all-sky map of high-energy sources. The observatory re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere on 2000 June 4. During its lifetime, the telescope detected more than 400 gamma-ray sources, ten times more than were previously known. The origins of many of these sources remain unknown. Prior to Compton, 300 gamma-ray bursts had been detected; observations from the satellite recorded a further 2500. One of BATSE’s most important contributions was an all-sky map of gamma-ray burst positions, which con- firmed that they originate well beyond our Galaxy. One of the major discoveries made by EGRET was a new class of quasars known as BLAZARS . The observatory also discov- ered a number of gamma-ray PULSARS , while observations of the galactic centre by OSSE revealed gamma radiation from the annihilation of positrons and electrons in the interstellar medium.

The curve will be a circle, ellipse, parabola or hyperbola depending on the angle at which the cross-section is taken. The significance for astronomy is that these curves are also the possible paths of a body moving under the gravitational attraction of a primary body. conjunction Alignment of two Solar System bodies with the Earth so that they appear in almost the same position in the sky as viewed from Earth. The INFERIOR PLANETS , Mercury and Venus, can align in this way either between the Sun and the Earth, when they said to be at INFERIOR CONJUNCTION , or when they lie on the opposite side of the Sun to the Earth, and are at SUPERI - OR CONJUNCTION . The superior planets can only come to superior conjunction. When a planet is at conjunction its ELONGATION is 0º. The strict definition of conjunction is when two bod- ies have the same celestial longitude as seen from Earth and because of the inclination of the various planetary orbits to the ecliptic, exact coincidence of position is rare. The term is also used to describe the apparent close approach in the sky of two or more planets, or of the Moon and one or more planets. constellation Arbitrary grouping of stars, 88 of which are recognized by modern astronomers.

The Chinese and Egyptian systems were completely different. In particular, the Chinese of the 3rd century AD had 283 constellations incorporating nearly 1500 stars. Many of the Chinese figures were small and faint, and some con- sisted merely of single stars. A constellation pattern has no real significance: the stars are at very different distances from us and appear close together only because of a line-of-sight effect. This is w ell demonstrated by \u0001 and \u0002 Centauri, which lie side-by- side in the sky although in fact \u0001 is 4 l.y. away while \u0002 is ov er 100 times as distant. PTOLEMY gave a list of 48 constellations in his ALMAGEST . He did not include the far southern sky, which w as below the horizon from his observing site in Alexan- dria, and there were gaps between his constellations; but all the figures he listed are retained by modern astronomers, although with somewhat different bound- aries. Many of those he named are drawn from ancient m ythology; for example the legend of Perseus and Andromeda is well represented. The gaps left by Ptolemy w ere filled in by others, notably Johannes HEVELIUS . Tw elve new southern constellations, mostly represent- ing exotic animals, including a bird of paradise and a fly- ing fish, were formed in around 1600 by two Dutch navigators, Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser and Frederick de Houtman. A far more detailed survey of the southern sky w as made in 1751–52 by the Frenchman LACAILLE , who catalogued nearly 10,000 stars from the Cape of Good Hope, modern South Africa. He introduced 14 new con- stellations to fill the gaps between Keyser and de Hout- man’s figures, mostly named after instruments of science and the arts, such as the Microscope, the Telescope and the Painter’s Easel. Lacaille also divided up the large Greek constellation Argo Navis into three more manage- able sections – Carina, Puppis and Vela. After Lacaille there was a period when almost every astronomer who produced a star map felt obliged to intro- duce new constellations, often with cumbersome names such as Globus Aerostaticus, the hot-air balloon, Machina Electrica, the electrical machine, and Officina Typograph- ica, the printing shop, all of which have been rejected. Another of these rejected constellations – Quadrans Muralis, the Mural Quadrant, invented by the Frenchman J. J. Lalande – is remembered because of the January mete- or shower called the QU ADRANTIDS , which radiates from the area it once occupied. Finally, in 1922, the INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION put matters on a more systematic footing. They fixed the accepted number of constellations at 88, and in 1928 adopted rigorous boundaries to the constellations based on circles of right ascension and declination, a sys- tem originally introduced for just the southern constella- tions in 1879 by Benjamin GOULD . The accompanying table gives the official list and their abbreviations. It is clear that the constellations are very unequal in size and importance; they range from the vast HYDRA to the tiny but brilliant CRUX . It is also true that there are some constellations that seem to have no justification for a sepa- rate existence, HOROLOGIUM and LEO MINOR being good examples. Only three constellations have more than one first-magnitude star (taking the first-magnitude limit as the conventional 1.49) – CENTAURUS , CRUX and ORION . Note also that although Ophiuchus is not reckoned as a zodiacal constellation, it does cross the zodiac between SCORPIUS and SAGITTARIUS .

Common envelope binaries are systems in which material has escaped from the Roche lobes to surround both stars. The exchange of mass and energy within contact binaries is not well understood. The best-known stable contact binaries are the W URSAE MAJORIS STARS , which consist of stars of spectral type G and K, with a typical mass ratio of 2:1. Material from the stars has escaped the Roche lobes and surrounds the components in a common envelope. Other observed stable contact binaries have massive early-type compo- nents or consist of cool SUPERGIANTS . If a star in a contact binary is much more massive and larger than its companion, then it may undergo a cata- strophic tidal instability, with the less massive star being pulled into its envelope. Resulting shock waves dissipate energy, expelling the outer envelope of the massive com- ponent and slowing the orbit of the binary system.

In planetary atmospheres, convective circulation combined with Coriolis forces leads to the for- mation of HADLEY CELLS , where warm gas rises and moves away from the equator, eventually cooling and returning at lower levels. Convection in stars is still poorly understood, although numerical models are improving. The models are based upon mixing length theory. This assumes that the convective elements move a characteris- tic length, known as the mixing length, releasing all their excess energy only at the top of their movement, or absorbing their entire energy deficit only at the bottom. The transfer of energy thus occurs as a result of both the upward and downward phases of convective motion. Between the top and bottom of the mixing length the material changes ADIABATICALLY . For convection to occur, material moving upwards and changing adiabatically must be at a lower density than the surrounding material, so that it experiences a buoyancy force, and continues its upward motion. This requirement gives the SCHWARZ - SCHILD criterion for convection to occur: where T is the temperature and P the pressure inside the star, and K a constant with the value of about 0.4 for completely ionized plasmas and about 0.1 for regions ov er which hydrogen is ionizing. In regions of stars where convection is occurring, the process transfers almost all the energy outwards. In other regions the ener- gy is transferred by radiation. For the Sun, convection occurs over the outer third of its radius and although it stops just below the visible surface, its effects can still be seen as solar GRANULATION .

At their Buckingham Works in York, England, Thomas Cooke & Sons made many fine large refracting telescopes for observatories round the world. The telescope built in 1881 for Liège University, with a 10- inch (250-mm) lens, was widely regarded as one of their finest. In 1871 the firm completed what was then the w orld’s largest refractor, a 25-inch (0.63-m) instrument for Robert Sterling Newall (1812–89). Cooke’s master optician was Harold Dennis Taylor (1862–1943), who invented the ‘Cooke photographic lens’ in the 1880s. In 1892 he made the first three-element apochromatic lens, designed to virtually eliminate chromatic aberration and to have sufficient colour correction for use in visual studies and photography. In 1922 Thomas Cooke & Sons bought out T roughton & Simms, forming by merger the firm of Cooke, Troughton & Simms, Ltd.

Ring systems might also be regarded as being sets of tiny co-orbiting satellites.

Popularly known as GREEN - WICH MEAN TIME (GMT), UTC is used as the basis for generating radio time signals. However, variations in the Earth’s rotation mean that time as kept by atomic clocks (UTC) and that derived from observations of the stars (UT1, see UNIVERSAL TIME ) gradually diverge. If this were allowed to go unchecked, the long term effect would be for time kept by clocks and that as shown by the Sun to become increasingly out of step. In order to avoid this, the two are kept within 0.9 second of one another through the periodic introduction of a LEAP SECOND into the UTC timescale, thus causing it to differ from INTERNATIONAL AT OMIC TIME (TAI) by an integral number of seconds.

Two hundred years later, it moved from its city centre site to the suburbs of Copenhagen. Today the observatory is operated by the University of Copenhagen as part of the Niels Bohr Institute for Astronomy, Physics and Geo- physics. Its researchers use the telescopes of the EURO - PEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY as well as the Danish 1.54-m (60-in.) telescope, completed in 1979 at LA SILLA OBSERVATORY . Copernican system HELIOCENTRIC THEORY of the Solar System advanced by Nicholas COPERNICUS , in which the Earth and the other planets revolve around the Sun, and only the Moon revolves around the Earth; the apparent daily motion of the sky is a consequence of the Earth’s axial rotation, and the stars are otherwise motionless because they are extremely distant. Shortly after 1500, Copernicus became interested in the problems inherent in the established PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM of an Earth-centred cosmology. Why, for instance, if the planets revolved around the Earth, did the retrograde, or reverse, motions of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn synchronize with the terrestrial year? The ancient geocentric cosmology required the operation of a host of eccentric circles and epicycles to explain such motions, whereas a heliocentric system could account for them simply as a consequence of the Earth’s orbital motion. By 1513 Copernicus had developed a workable heliocentric model that addressed various problems in planetary dynamics. It appears to incorporate elements drawn from the work of the Arab astronomers AL - TU ̄ SI ̄ and Ibn al-Sha ̄t ir (1304–75/6). The Copernican system seriously threatened the universally accepted physics of ARISTOTLE , and Copernicus feared ridicule from other scholars. However, he was finally prevailed upon to publish his DE REVOLUTIONIBUS ORBIUM COELESTIUM just before his death in 1543. The Copernican system was still based on circular rather than elliptical orbits (and w as as a consequence worse at predicting planetary positions than the Ptolemaic system it sought to replace), and it placed the Sun at the centre of the cosmos, in a privileged position; but it did offer a logical sequence of planetary revolution periods that increased with distance from the Sun, an important step forward. More importantly, it marked the beginning of the end for geocentricism. Copernicus, Nicholas (1473–1543) Polish churchman and astronomer who proposed that the planets revolve around a fixed Sun. (‘Copernicus’ is the Latinized form of his name, by which he is almost always known; the Polish form is Miko ≥ aj Kopernik.) Through his study of plane- tary motions, he developed a heliocentric theory of the Universe in which the planets’ motions in the sky were explained by having them orbit the Sun, as opposed to the geocentric (Earth-centred) model that had been favoured since the days of ARISTOTLE and PTOLEMY . The motion of the sky was now simply a result of the Earth’s axial rota- tion, and, relative to the CELESTIAL SPHERE , the stars remained fixed as the Earth orbited the Sun because they w ere so distant. An account of his work, DE REVOLUTION - IBUS ORBIUM COELESTIUM , was published in 1543. Copernicus studied canonical law and medicine at the universities of Cracow, Bologna and Padua. At Bologna (1496–1500), he learned astronomy and astrology from Domenico de Novara (1454–1504), using his observations of the 1497 March 9 lunar occultation of Aldebaran to calculate the Moon’s diameter. Copernicus returned to Poland in 1503, as a canon in the cathedral chapter of Warmia; he also practised medicine but maintained a lively interest in astronomy, being invited (1514) to reform the JULIAN CALENDAR . In Copernicus’ day it was universally accepted that the Earth was solidly fixed at the centre of the cosmos. Ptolemy had explained planetary motions by having epicycles turn on larger circles around each planet’s orbit ( see PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM ). Copernicus explored the consequences of fixing the Sun in the centre of the planetary system, with the Earth and the other planets orbiting it. Being a classical scholar rather than a self- conscious innovator, he began to examine the ancient Greek writers to see whether precedents for a heliocentric system existed, and found several, most notably in the writings of Heraclides of Pontus (388–315 BC ) and ARISTARCHUS of Samos. Precisely what motivated Copernicus’ radical departure from traditional astronomy is not known, but it is likely that he w as also influenced by works that were critical of the Ptolemaic system, including the Epitome of Ptolemy’s Almagest by REGIOMONTANUS and Disputations Against Divinatory Astrology by Giovanni della Mirandola (1463–94). While in Cracow, he may have encountered the writings of AL - TU ̄ SI ̄. In the COPERNICAN SYSTEM , the epicycles of the superior planets (Mars, Jupiter and Saturn) could be discarded because their motions were explained by the effects of the Earth’s orbit around a centralized Sun; for the inferior planets (Mercury and Venus) Copernicus centred their epicycles on the Sun instead of on separate carrying circles. Mercury, the swiftest planet, was closest to the Sun, and Saturn, the slowest, orbited at the outer bound of the Solar System, the other planets falling into place according to their periods of revolution. In 1514 Copernicus first described his new model of the Solar System in a small tract, the Commentariolus (‘Little Commentary’), which he distributed to only a few colleagues. The heliocentric theory was set forth in g reater detail by his student RHAETICUS in the work Narratio prima , published in 1540/41. Copernicus’ famous book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium , considered to be the definitive statement of his system of planetary motions, did not appear until the year of his death. It was Rhaeticus who had finally persuaded him to publish. Copernicus’ reticence had had nothing to do with fear of persecution by the Catholic Church: as an ecclesiastical lawyer, he knew that the Church had no dogmatic rulings on scientific matters. What he had feared was academic ridicule in Europe’s universities for seeming to contradict common sense. In De revolutionibus , Copernicus refuted the ancient arguments for the immobility of the Earth, citing the advantages of the new Sun-centred model, which correctly ordered the planets by the rate at which they appeared to move through the heavens, and explaining the phenomenon of RETROGRADE MOTION . He correctly explained that the motions of the stars that would be produced by a moving Earth were not observable simply because the stars were so far away – ‘so vast, without any question, is the divine handiwork of the Almighty Creator’. F ollowing the publication of De revolutionibus , most astronomers considered the Copernican system as merely a hypothetical scheme – a means of predicting planetary Copernican system 96 C \u0001 Copernican system Copernicus’ model of the Solar System put the Sun at the centre, with Earth and the other planets in orbit about it.

Most astronomers continued to follow Aristotle’s physics, in which the Earth was viewed as a perfect, immovable body rather than a transient, moving entity, while the Ptolemaic system actually gave more accurate planetary positions than Copernicus’ original scheme. Not until the discoveries of Johannes KEPLER and GALILEO did the Copernican system begin to make physical as well as geometrical sense. As a consequence of Galileo’s writings, De revolutionibus w as in 1616 placed on the Index of prohibited books by the Catholic Church. The book was not actually banned, however, but small alterations were introduced to make the Copernican system appear entirely hypothetical. But by then Copernicus’ book was already being superseded by Kepler’s Astronomia nova (1609) and the Rudolphine Tables (1627), which provided the basis for explaining the irregularities in the motions of the planets that had not been satisfactorily accounted for in Copernican system. Copernicus Large lunar crater (10ºN 20ºW), known for its complex system of EJECTA and bright RAYS . Situated on the north shore of Mare Nubium, Copernicus dominates the Moon’s north-west quadrant. The crater’s lava-flooded floor, 92 km (57 mi) wide with multiple central peaks, lies nearly 4 km (2.5 mi) below its highly detailed walls. Dominating the inner ramparts of Copernicus are massive arc-shaped landslides, which formed by collapse and subsidence of the debris left over from the violent impact that created the main crater. A bright, broad (30 km/20 mi) blanket of ejecta surrounds the polygonal walls. Beyond this ring of bright material, Copernicus’ majestic rays, best seen at full moon, radiate for hundreds of kilometres. These features testify to the relative ‘youth’ of Copernicus, which is 800 million years old. Numerous chains of craterlets curve outwards from the main crater in every direction. T win mountain ridges, running roughly east–west and separated by a spacious valley, divide the floor of Coper- nicus in half. The north group of mountains is com- posed of three major peaks of modest altitudes, the highest peak attaining 750 m (2400 ft). The south ridge, with a huge pyramidal mountain at its centre, is longer than the north ridge.

Cor Caroli The star \u0001 Canum Venaticorum, visual mag. 2.89 (but slightly variable), distance 110 l.y. It is of spectral type A0p, with unusually prominent lines of silicon and europium. Cor Caroli is the prototype of the class of ALPHA 2 CANUM VENATICORUM STARS ; like all stars in this class, it varies slightly as it rotates, due to surface patches of different composition brought about by strong localized magnetic fields. Small telescopes show it to be a double star, with an unrelated companion of mag. 5.61. Cor Caroli is Latin for ‘Charles’ heart’, a name bestowed by British royalists to commemorate the beheaded King Charles I of England.

With OPHELIA it acts as a SHEPHERD MOON to Uranus’ Epsilon Ring, Cordelia being just inside the orbit of that ring.

It has a 1.5-m (60-in.) reflector, and its astronomers also use major multinational facilities such as the GEMINI OBSERVATORY . core (planetary) Dense central region of a planet, having a composition distinct from the outer layers ( MANTLE and CRUST ). A planetary core forms when heavier compo- nents sink to the planet’s centre during DIFFERENTIATION . Earth’s core, which makes up nearly a third of the planet’s mass, is composed mostly of iron alloyed with nickel and lighter elements, of which sulphur is probably the most abundant. The core is mostly liquid, but with a small solid inner core. Convective motions in the liquid iron generate Earth’s magnetic field. Most of the core’s prop- erties are inferred by SEISMOLOGY . Mercury, Venus and Mars have iron cores as deduced from their densities and moments of inertia; the Moon is depleted in iron but may have a small core. The larger icy satellites of the outer planets probably possess rocky cores beneath icy mantles. The densities of the GAS GIANT planets imply that they possess cores of rock and icy material with masses of order 10 times Earth’s mass; these cores probably formed by A CCRETION before the planets acquired their massive gaseous envelopes. See also COSMOGONY core (stellar) Innermost region of a star; it is the region in which HYDROGEN BURNING takes place when the star is on the MAIN SEQUENCE . The Sun’s core is believed to extend out to a quarter of the solar radius.

The corona (from Latin ‘crown’) becomes visible as a white halo surrounding the Sun at a TO TA L SOLAR ECLIPSE , and can be observed at other times using a special instrument called a CORONAGRAPH . Coronal material is heated to tem- peratures of millions of Kelvin, and consequently emits energy at extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. Observations at these wavelengths show the corona over the whole of the Sun’s face, with the cooler, underlying PHOTOSPHERE appearing dark. The visible, white light corona may be divided into the inner K CORONA , within two or three solar radii of the pho- tosphere, and the outer F CORONA . The K corona shines by visible sunlight that is weakly scattered by free elec- trons. It is about one-millionth as intense as the photos- phere. Observations of the K corona indicate there are up to ten million billion (10 12 ) electrons per cubic metre at the base of the corona. The F corona is caused by sunlight scattered from solid dust particles. The shape of the inner K corona reflects constraint of electrons by MAGNETIC FIELDS . At the base of coronal streamers, the electrons are concentrated within magnetized loops rooted in the pho- tosphere. Farther out, the streamers narrow into long, radial stalks that stretch tens of millions of kilometres into space; some may reach as far as halfway to Earth. At times of reduced activity, near the minimum of the SOLAR CYCLE , coronal streamers are located mainly near the solar equator. The coronal streamers are the source of the low-speed SOLAR WIND . Near maximum in the activity c ycle, the corona becomes crowded with streamers both near the equator and the Sun’s poles. The corona’s high temperatures are capable of strip- ping iron atoms of 13 of their electrons, producing an ion- ized form whose emission in green light at wavelength 530.3 nm was first detected at the total eclipse of 1869 August 7. Initially taken – mistakenly – to be the signature of a new element (‘coronium’), FeXIV emission provides a useful tracer for coronal structure. Further evidence for the corona’s high temperatures comes from observation of its radio emission. Gas in the corona is completely ion- ized, and is therefore in the form of a PLASMA . Recent observations of the corona from spacecraft sug- gest that at least some of the heat of the corona is related to the Sun’s ever-changing magnetic fields. These observa- tions have been made using a soft X-ray telescope on the Y OHKOH spacecraft, and with ultraviolet and extreme- ultraviolet telescopes aboard SOHO and TRACE. Images of the Sun at extreme-ultraviolet and X-ray wa v elengths reveal dark regions, called coronal holes , and bright regions, known as coronal loops . Coronal holes are characterized by open magnetic fields that allow hot material to escape. At least some of the high-speed component of the solar wind flows out of the coronal holes nearly always present at the Sun’s poles. Coronal holes extending towards the solar equator become com- mon close to the minimum of the solar cycle. The hottest and densest material in the low corona is located in thin, bright magnetized loops that shape, mould and constrain the million-degree plasma. These coronal loops have strong magnetic fields that link regions of opposite polarity in the underlying photosphere. Coronal heating is usually greatest where the magnetic fields are strongest. High-resolution TRACE images have demon- strated that the coronal loops are heated in their legs, sug- gesting the injection of hot material from somewhere near the loop footpoints in the photosphere below. Coronal loops can rise from inside the Sun, sink back down into it, or expand out into space, constantly chang- ing and causing the corona to vary in brightness and structure. These changing magnetic loops can heat the corona by coming together and releasing stored magnetic energy when they make contact. This method of coronal heating is termed MAGNETIC RECONNECTION . It can occur when newly emerging magnetic fields rise through the photosphere to encounter pre-existing ones in the corona, or when internal motions force existing coronal loops together. There are about 50,000 small magnetic loops in the low corona; these come and go every 40 hours or so, forming an ever-changing magnetic carpet. SOHO obser- va tions indicate that energy is frequently released when these loops interact and reconnect, providing another pos- sible source of coronal heating. Bursts of powerful energy released during magnetic reconnection can explain sud- den, brief intense explosions on the Sun called FLARES . Numerous low-level flares, called microflares or nanoflares, might contribute to coronal heating.

There are two coronagraph instruments aboard the SOHO spacecraft, for example. coronal hole See CORONA coronal mass ejection (CME) Transient ejection into interplanetary space of plasma and magnetic fields from the solar CORONA , seen in sequential images taken with a CORO - NAGRAPH . A coronal mass ejection expands away from the Sun at supersonic speeds up to 1200 km/s (750 mi/s), becoming larger than the Sun in a few hours and removing up to 50 million tonnes of material. CMEs are often associ- a ted with eruptive PROMINENCES in the chromosphere, and sometimes with solar FLARES in the lower corona. Coronal mass ejections are more frequent at the maxi- mum of the SOLAR CYCLE , when they occur at a rate of about 3.5 events per day. They can, however, occur at any time in the solar cycle, and unlike coronal streamers, they are not confined to equatorial latitudes at solar minimum. CMEs are most readily seen when directed perpen- dicular to the line of sight, expanding outwards from the solar limb; Earth-directed events are seen as diffuse, expanding rings described as halo coronal mass ejec- tions. Earth-directed CMEs can cause intense MAGNETIC STORMS , and trigger enhanced auroral activity. Coronal mass ejections produce intense shock waves in the SOLAR WIND , and accelerate vast quantities of energetic parti- cles. A large CME may release as much as 10 25 J oule of energy, comparable to that in a solar flare. Like flares, CMEs are believed to result from release of stored mag- netic stress. In view of their influence on the near-Earth space environment, CMEs are monitored by national centres and defence agencies. coronal streamer See CORONA coronium Chemical element initially hypothesized to explain an unidentified green emission line observed in the solar CORONA (as well as others found later).

After about 15 min- utes, the temperature of the universe had dropped and no further nucleosynthesis could occur until stars formed. Thus all of the heavier elements must have been synthesized in stars and during SUPERNOVA explosions. Calculations indicate that only one 3 He or 4 He atom is formed for every 10,000 hydrogen atoms, and one lithi- um or beryllium atom for every hundred million hydro- gen atoms. All of the remaining elements in the Universe w ere thus created in the centres of stars or during super- nova explosions. Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) NASA satel- lite launched in 1989 November to study COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND radiation – the leftover radiation from the BIG BANG . COBE made precise measurements of the diffuse radiation between 1 \u0001 m and 1 cm over the whole celestial sphere. As well as measuring the spectrum of this radiation, COBE also studied fluctuations in its temperature distribution, and the spectrum and angular distribution of diffuse infrared background radiation. The spacecraft’s instruments were cooled by liquid helium and protected from solar heating by a conical sun shade. The satellite rotated at 1 rpm and performed a complete scan of the celestial sphere every six months. COBE first determined that the cosmic microwave background has a black body temperature of 2.73 K. Its ov erall view of the sky showed that one-half of the sky is slightly warmer than the other half as the result of the Solar System’s motion through space. Then, in 1992, sci- entists announced that COBE had found ‘ripples’ in the background radiation, regions that were no more than 30- millionths of a degree warmer or cooler than the average temperature. These minute variations were attributed to gaseous structures several hundred million light-years across that existed in the Universe around the time the first galaxies were forming. COBE’s scientific operations were terminated at the end of 1993. Five years later, astronomers released the first maps to show a background infrared glow across the sky. Based on data from the Diffuse Infrared Back- g round Experiment aboard COBE, they revealed the ‘fossil radiation’ from dust that was heated by hidden stars in the very early Universe. cosmic dust See MICROMETEORITE cosmic microwave background (CMB) Remnant radiation from the creation of the Universe. Early cos- mologists predicted theoretically that the Universe origi- nally began as a singularity that expanded into a small, hot ‘soup’ of radiation and elementary particles. As it expanded, the temperature dropped and the nuclei of a toms became stable. Finally, after the first 300,000 y ears, the Universe was cold enough for the radiation to decouple from the matter. As the Universe continued to expand and cool, the radiation and matter evolved inde- pendently. The radiation cooled (redshifted) as the Uni- ve r se expanded but remained homogeneous and isotropic on a large scale; the matter clumped owing to gr a vitational interactions on smaller scales. Predictions w ere made that at the present stage of the Universe, the temperature of this background radiation field should have cooled to around 5 K. In 1965 Arno PENZIAS and Robert Wilson attempted to r id the large Bell Telephone Laboratory microwave anten- na of background noise. This noise appeared to be con- stant and, if it originated outside the antenna, was extraterrestrial and isotropic and represented a back- g round temperature of 3 K. They realized that they were indeed observing the cosmic microwave background radi- a tion that is a remnant of the early Universe. Astronomers realized that this cosmic microwave back- g round held clues to the physical conditions early in the evolution of the Universe. NASA launched a satellite, the COSMIC BACKGROUND EXPLORER (COBE), to investigate this radiation in detail. COBE mapped the radiation in frequency as well as spatially with unprecedented accura- cy and confirmed the background temperature at 2.73 K. It also mapped the temperature variations in all directions. This mapping provided evidence for the inflationary sce- nario of the early Universe. cosmic rays Charged particles (protons and the nuclei of heavier atoms) that arrive at the top of the atmosphere and come from cosmic space. Their energies extend up to 10 20 electron volts (eV) per particle and thus represent the highest individual particle energies known. The particles that come from space and hit the top of the atmosphere are called primary cosmic rays, and the particles that hit the ground are called secondary cosmic rays. Initially it w as thought that cosmic rays comprised some form of ultra-penetrating gamma radiation, hence the term cosmic rays, but later work showed that particles, mainly protons, w ere responsible. Telescopes have been operated in many different environments, from satellites to the bottom of deep mines; directional telescopes in mines have shown upward-moving cosmic rays caused by NEUTRINOS that have penetrated the whole Earth before interacting to cause detectable secondary rays. Special ground-based telescopes can detect the extensive air showers that occur when a primary particle hits an oxygen or nitrogen nucle- us in the upper levels of the atmosphere. The initial sec- ondary particles are pions, but these decay to the more stable muons. At ground level the showers contain mainly electrons with perhaps 5% muons. The discovery of cosmic rays is credited to the Austrian physicist Victor HESS , who, in 1912, carried electrometers aloft in a balloon in an attempt to discover why it had proved impossible to eliminate completely a small residual background reading in the electrometers at ground level. Hess found that, after first falling, the reading started to increase as the balloon ascended and he made the remark- able claim that there was a need ‘to have recourse to a new h ypothesis; either invoking the assumption of the presence at g reat altitudes of unknown matter or the assumption of an extraterrestrial source of penetrating radiation’. After arguments lasting some years the extraterrestrial origin idea finally won; Hess was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1936. Since cosmic rays are charged particles, they are deflected by magnetic fields in the Galaxy and beyond, so it is sometimes difficult to be certain about their origins. Cosmic Background Explorer 100 C \u0001 Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) This all-sky temperature map derived from COBE data shows radiation in the direction towards which Earth is moving to be blue- shifted and therefore hotter. Conversely, in the opposite direction, the radiation appears cooler due to redshift. The data suggest that our Local Group of galaxies moves at 600 km/s (375 mi/s) relative to the background radiation. CORVUS ( GEN . CORVI , ABBR .

It has been suggested that CYGNUS X -3 provides a significant fraction of the cosmic rays in the Galaxy, but the galactic centre also produces cosmic rays, as may other objects such as supernovae. Some of the highest-energy cosmic rays come from the VIRGO CLUSTER ; it contains the galaxy M87, which has a JET showing that there may be a super- massive BLACK HOLE at its centre. Low-energy cosmic rays are emitted by the Sun. One of the unusual features of these is the presence of comparatively large fluxes of the elements lithium, beryllium and boron, which are identi- fied as fragments of heavier cosmic ray nuclei that have struck nuclei of the interstellar medium. The presence of a ve ry small fraction of radioactive beryllium-l0 ( 10 Be), taken with other data, leads to an estimated lifetime of low-energy cosmic rays of at least 20 \u0001 10 6 y ears. Low- energy cosmic rays cause the production of radioactive carbon ( 14 C) and beryllium ( 10 Be) in the atmosphere, which leads to the possibility of studying intensity varia- tions over 10 3 –10 7 y ear periods from studies of 14 C in tree r ings and 10 Be in deep-sea sediments. cosmic year Time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution about the centre of the Milky Way galaxy – about 220 million Earth years. The entire Galaxy is rotat- ing, gradually changing shape as it does so, and the Sun is located some 28,000 l.y. from the galactic centre. cosmochemistry Study of the chemical reactions occurring in space and of the products of those reactions. The atoms forming most elements are synthesized inside stars ( see ASTROCHEMISTRY ) and then a small proportion is returned to interstellar space during SUPERNOVA explo- sions. The exceptions to this are principally hydrogen and helium-4, and to a much lesser extent deuterium (hydro- gen-2), helium-3 and lithium-7, which were created in the first few seconds of the Big Bang. The roughly 25% (by mass) of the matter in the Universe that is helium-4, for example, resulted from reactions such as n \u0002 e \u0002 → p \u0002 \u0003 e where n is neutron, e \u0002 is a positron (positive electron), p is a proton and v e is an electron neutrino. Such reactions w ere in equilibrium during the early stages of the Big Bang and left a balance of 1 neutron to 6 protons when they ceased. The surviving neutrons (for the neutron is an unstable particle) eventually combined with protons to produce the helium nuclei. Hydrogen and helium form about 98% by mass of all the material in the inter- stellar medium, with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon, sulphur, argon and iron making up most of the balance. Many other elements have been detected, and we may expect all those found on Earth, plus some of those that do not occur naturally, such as technetium and plutonium, to occur in space. However, the molecules that can currently be observed are mostly combinations of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and/or oxy- gen ( see INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES ). One significant reason for this is that it is only molecules in the form of gases that can be identified with certainty (from their radio spectra). The composition of solid materials, such as interstellar dust particles (see INTERSTELLAR MAT - TER ), can be only roughly characterized. Once formed, the atoms in interstellar space can take part in chemical reactions, but the conditions differ so much from that of a terrestrial chemistry laboratory, that the reactions and their products are often very unusual by ‘normal’ chemistry’s standards. Some molecules, such as TiO, CN and C 2 , are robust enough to exist in the outer atmospheres of cool stars. However, most molecules will be dissociated by the ultra- violet radiation in starlight if they float freely in space. The interiors of GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUDS (GMCs) are thus the sites where the vast majority of interstellar molecules are to be found. There they are sheltered by dust from the stellar ultraviolet radiation. Even though GMCs are much denser than the average for the interstellar medium, they are still very hard vacuums by terrestrial laboratory standards. Thus interactions usual- ly take place between two atoms in isolation, and this can make it difficult for stable chemical reactions to occur. For example, if two neutral hydrogen atoms encounter each other and join to form a molecule, the molecule will be highly excited because of the kinetic energy possessed by the atoms. It will thus be unstable, and under terrestrial conditions would lose its excess energy to a third particle to form the stable hydrogen molecule. That third particle is unlikely to be nearby within a GMC, and so the molecule will rapidly dissociate back to the two original hydrogen a toms. A possible way out of this would be for the excited h ydrogen molecule to radiate away its excess energy, but most of the lower energy transitions of the hydrogen mole- cule are forbidden, and so this is unlikely to occur. Stable reactions can occur when one of the particles is ionized, perhaps as a result of a collision with a COSMIC RAY particle. Thus water can be formed from an ionized h ydrogen molecule in combination with oxygen through the following set of reactions: H 2 \u0002 \u0002 H 2 → H 3 \u0002 \u0002 H H 3 \u0002 \u0002 O → OH \u0002 \u0002 H 2 OH \u0002 \u0002 H 2 → H 2 O \u0002 \u0002 H H 2 O \u0002 \u0002 H 2 → H 3 O \u0002 \u0002 H H 3 O \u0002 \u0002 e \u0004 → H 2 O \u0002 H It is thought that many molecules are formed only on the surfaces of the dust particles within the GMC. Indi- vidual atoms are adsorbed on to the dust particle and are then in such close proximity that relatively normal reac- tions can occur. The daughter molecule may be ejected back into space by the energy released during the reaction, or perhaps a cosmic ray particle passing through the dust particle may heat it sufficiently to evaporate all the mole- cules that have accumulated on its surface. cosmogony Scientific discipline dealing with the forma- tion of the Solar System or planetary systems in general. Cosmogony as a science began with the NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS of Immanuel KANT and Pierre Simon LAPLACE in the late 18th century; the PLANETESIMAL h ypothesis was developed a century later by T.C. CHAM - BERLIN and F.R. MOULTON . Although some features of their hypotheses have been incorporated into modern the- ories, most current research is based on the work of V.S. SAFRONOV . Until the latter half of the 20th century, cos- mogony was primarily a field for speculation, with little possibility for testing theories. That situation has changed significantly for several reasons: computers have been developed that allow detailed numerical simulations of proposed processes; a wealth of data about bodies in our o wn Solar System has been provided by spacecraft; and EXTRASOLAR PLANETS have been discovered orbiting near- by stars. Cosmogony is now an active field of research conducted at a high level of detail and sophistication. There is currently a ‘standard model’ that gives a gen- eral explanation of the formation of the Solar System. Many details remain to be worked out, and some parts of 101 C \u0001 cosmic microwave background This all-sky temperature map from COBE, from which the effects due to the motion of the Earth have been subtracted, shows ‘ripples’ in the cosmic microwave background. Although the extent of these variations is tiny – 30 millionths of a degree – they are believed to have been sufficient to trigger formation of the first galaxies after the Big Bang.

It is generally accepted that planetary systems are not rare, but are a common product of star formation. Stars form from clouds of interstellar gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, containing a small fraction of heavier elements, mostly in the form of dust grains. If the gas reaches a crit- ical density it begins to collapse under its self-gravity. This collapse may be initiated by a number of phenomena: cooling of the gas; loss of a supporting magnetic field; or an external perturbation that compresses the gas. Most star formation is observed to occur in clusters, as portions of a large cloud, with a total mass perhaps thousands of times that of the Sun, collapse over an interval of millions of years. The most massive stars have short lifetimes and explode as SUPERNOVAE within the cloud, mixing their material back into the medium and triggering further col- lapses by their shock waves. As a stellar-mass portion of the cloud collapses, it loses energy by infrared radiation from dust grains and molecules. ANGULAR MOMENTUM is conserved, and any initial rotation increases in speed as the cloud contracts. Clouds with larger amounts of angu- lar momentum may produce a BINARY STAR . For lesser amounts, turbulence and magnetic coupling redistribute angular momentum, allowing most of the mass to fall towards the centre, while a portion remains in a rotating PROTOPLANETARY DISK orbiting the PROTOSTAR . The protoplanetary disk is heated by the kinetic energy of its infall. Its inner part becomes hot enough to vaporize the dust, and the gas nearest the protostar is ionized. In the outer part, grains of interstellar dust may survive; as the disk cools, heavier elements recondense in the inner region. Dust grains collide and stick together to produce centimetre-sized aggregate particles, which settle towards the central plane of the disk, where they form a thin, dense particle layer. Particles in this layer are subject to drag exerted by the gas, which causes bodies of different sizes to move at different rates; they may also collide due to tur- b ulence. They continue to grow, forming PLANETESIMALS of kilometre size. At this stage they are less affected by the drag of the nebular gas, and gravitational interactions become important. Their perturbations stir up eccentrici- ties and inclinations, causing the orbits of the planetesi- mals to cross, which results in frequent collisions. These collisions may produce both growth and fragmentation, b ut the energy loss in inelastic collisions ensures that gr o wth dominates. By this process of A CCRETION , a small number of large bodies, or PROTOPLANETS , forms. Colli- sions among them continue for millions of years until the remaining bodies are few and widely separated, yielding planets on stable orbits. The Moon is believed to have formed from debris after a Mars-sized protoplanet collid- ed with the still-growing Earth. The final sweeping up of smaller bodies takes tens of millions of years. Fa r ther from the protosun, cooler temperatures allow ice to condense, providing more material and allowing gr o wth of larger protoplanets. If these protoplanets reach a critical size, several times Earth’s mass, they can capture gas from the protoplanetary disk, growing into giant plan- ets like Jupiter and Saturn. After a few million years the gaseous component of the disk is driven off by activity of the newly formed star as it goes through its TTA URI phase. Still farther out, the growth times of the protoplanets are too long, and the disk may dissipate before they can cap- ture large amounts of gas; planets like Uranus and Nep- tune result, their makeup being dominated by the accretion of icy cometary planetesimals. This model for planetary formation provides a plausi- ble qualitative explanation for the major features of the Solar System, although some parts are uncertain and many details remain to be worked out. The degree to which our planetary system is typical or unique is not known. The existence of extrasolar planets in systems quite unlike our own shows that other outcomes are possi- ble. The final form of a planetary system probably depends on both systematic factors, such as the mass and angular momentum of a protostellar cloud, its tempera- ture and composition, and so on, as well as on random events, such as the proximity of other stars and the out- comes of collisions between protoplanets. cosmological constant Constant in Einstein’s FIELD EQUATIONS of GENERAL RELATIVITY , originally added to stabilize the universe. If one writes down the general rela- tivistic equation for the universe, one finds that the uni- ve r se cannot be static, but must either expand or contract. When Einstein derived his ‘universe’ equation, astronomers had no idea the Universe was actually in a state of expansion. Therefore, Einstein added another term in the field equations multiplied by a constant: R \u0001\u0002 \u0003 \u0001 \u0002 g \u0001\u0002 \u0004\u0005 g \u0001\u0002 = 8 \u0006 G / c 2 T \u0001\u0002 where \u0005 is the cosmological constant, R \u0001\u0002 is the Riemann tensor, g \u0001\u0002 is the metric tensor, G is Newton’s universal constant of gravitation, c is the speed of light and T \u0001\u0002 is the stress-energy tensor. This cosmological constant can provide an attractive or repulsive force that operates throughout the entire universe and causes expansion, contraction or stability depending on its value. Shortly after Einstein published the addition to his theory, Edwin HUBBLE announced his observations of galaxies that showed the Universe was indeed in a state of constant expansion. Einstein quickly retracted his cosmological constant as being unnecessary and announced it as his biggest blunder. Even after astrophysicists realized that no cosmological constant w as needed, some kept it and gave it a very small value, or a time-dependent value (in the case of inflationary theory). Lately, new observations of universal accelera- tion combined with the low mass density seen in the Universe indicate that it might be necessary after all. See also BIG BANG THEORY cosmological distance scale Methods and scales with which astronomers determine the distance between galax- ies and clusters in the visible Universe. In order to under- stand our Universe, the distances to galaxies must be determined. In order to measure these tremendous dis- tances, astronomers rely on a variety of methods. Distances in the Solar System can be measured by radar, and nearby stellar distances can be measured by direct stellar P ARALLAX . In order to determine the dis- tances to more distant stars, model-dependent methods like main-sequence fitting and the period–luminosity rela- tionship for CEPHEID VARIABLES must be used. Measuring the distances to nearby galaxies relies upon detection of Cepheid variables or other bright stellar phenomena such as supernovae in those galaxies. These methods are fairly accurate for nearby galaxies, but become more difficult and uncertain for more distant galaxies. Other methods such as the TULLY – FISHER RELATION can be used for dis- tance estimates of spiral galaxies, while distances to ellipti- cal galaxies require assumptions about the average size of g iant ellipticals in a cluster. Farther and farther out into the Universe, distance measurement becomes more and more uncertain. Until recently this has prevented us from determining what type of universe we live in. This series of methods is also called the cosmic dis- tance ‘ladder’, where each rung represents a method to determine the distance to more distant objects. Each method also depends on the previous one for accurate cal- ibration. The final rung of the cosmological distance scale is the HUBBLE LAW . This relationship is used for objects so far away that we cannot image individual stars, molecular clouds, or even individual supernovae, and it is essential to have a reliable value for the HUBBLE CONSTANT to use it. cosmological model Any of several theories or ideas that attempt to describe and explain the form and evolution of our UNIVERSE . The original cosmological model held that the Earth was the centre of the Universe, with the Sun, Moon and planets orbiting around us and the stars affixed to the CELESTIAL SPHERE . This geocentric (Earth-centred) model was in favour for over 1000 years after PTOLEMY first wrote it down. This model failed to explain the elliptical cosmological constant 102 C C AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 10:41 am Page 102"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"cosmology shapes of planetary orbits, the westward drift or retrograde motion of the planets, and the phases of Venus. The geo- centric model was subsequently replaced by the more pow- erful heliocentric or ‘Sun-centred’ model. The heliocentric model was capable of explaining retrograde motion much more easily than its predecessor. Although COPERNICUS was the first to show that the heliocentric model was far better in explaining the observations than the geocentric model, it w as not until after GALILEO ’s time that it became politically acceptable to publish such an idea. The current accepted cosmological model, called the BIG BANG , is based on Ein- stein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY and maintains that at one moment SPACETIME w as collapsed into an infinitely small point, and subsequently the entire Universe expanded and continues to expand. Other cosmological models include the anisotropic models, the STEADY - STATE THEORY and BRANS – DICKE THEORY . cosmological principle Assumption that SPACETIME is homogeneous and isotropic on the largest of scales and that we do not live in a preferred place in the Universe. This sweeping principle allows us to solve Einstein’s FIELD EQUATIONS and to build COSMOLOGICAL MODELS that can be tested with observations. cosmological redshift Shift of spectral lines due to the expansion of the Universe. Galaxies and clusters are locat- ed in SPACETIME , which is uniformly expanding and car- r ying the galaxies along with it; thus the galaxies exhibit a v elocity relative to a distant observer. The ‘Doppler-type’ effect is not a result of the sources’ velocity in spacetime, b ut is caused by the expansion of spacetime itself. Edwin HUBBLE showed in 1929 that the Universe is expanding, and further that the cosmological velocity is linearly relat- ed to the distance of the source. See also HUBBLE LAW cosmology Study of the structure of the Universe on the largest scale. Contained within it is COSMOGONY . Our early view of the Universe was prejudiced by the belief that we occupied a special place within it – at the centre. Only in the 20th century have we realized that the Earth is but a small planet of a dim star, located in the outer suburbs of a typical galaxy. Perhaps the most impor- tant astronomical discovery of the early 20th century was HUBBLE ’ S realization that the dim NEBULAE he observed w ere in fact enormous systems of thousands of millions of stars lying far outside our Galaxy. Soon after this discov- ery, astronomers realized that these galaxies were all reced- ing from the Earth. Hubble, along with other astronomers, obtained optical spectra of many galaxies and found that their spectral lines were always shifted towards the red (longer wavelengths). He interpreted these REDSHIFTS as being a universal DOPPLER EFFECT , caused by the expan- sion of the Universe. Furthermore, the speed he inferred w as found to be proportional to the galaxy’s distance, a relationship known as the HUBBLE LAW . It is now known that both the shift and the speed–dis- tance proportionality follow naturally from an overall expansion of the scale size of the Universe. Galaxies are redshifted because the Universe has a different scale size now compared with the size it was when the light was emit- ted from the galaxies. Nevertheless, time has shown that Hubble was correct in his interpretation that the speed of recession is proportional to distance. Today, the constant of proportionality bears his name ( see HUBBLE CONSTANT ). Close to the Sun, the distance of galaxies can be deter- mined from the properties of some V ARIABLE STARS they contain – such as the Cepheids – or from the size of HII regions. As we move farther out into the Universe, however, these methods become increasingly inaccurate. Eventually, distances can only be estimated by measuring the redshift and relying on the accuracy of the Hubble relation. Unfortunately, for some of the most distant objects, such as QU ASARS , we do not have adequate confirmation that this procedure for determining distances is valid. Some astronomers believe that at least part of the quasar redshifts may originate from unknown ‘non-cosmological’ causes. Attempts to determine the nature of the reshifts and the expansion rate have occupied much of the available time on large telescopes. Today the question is still unresolved. However, perhaps the most important cosmological problems that remain at the beginning of the 21st century are to determine the rate at which the universal expansion is taking place (determining the Hubble constant), how it has expanded in the past and how it will continue to behave in the future. To these must be added the question of whether the overall geometry of the Universe is ‘closed’ or ‘open’. In an OPEN UNIVERSE , the total volume of space is infinite, the universe has no boundary and will expand for ever. CLOSED UNIVERSES contain a finite amount of space, may or may not have boundaries and will eventual- ly collapse back on themselves. Attempts to obtain a grand view of the Universe have led to the construction of cosmological models. A starting point for many cosmologists has been the finding that the Universe appears much the same in all directions (the so- called ISOTROPY ) and at all distances ( HOMOGENEITY ). However, the expansion of the Universe would at first seem to suggest that the overall density of the distribution of galaxies must decrease so that they become more sparsely distributed as time goes on. Cosmological models have included the STEADY - STATE THEORY of Hermann BONDI , Thomas GOLD and Fred HOYLE in which the Universe is the same not only in all places but also at all times. It therefore had no beginning, will have no end and never changes at all when viewed on the large scale. This theory required matter to be created as the Universe expanded in order that the overall density of galaxies should not decrease. For this reason it is also referred to as the CONTINUOUS CREATION model. On the other hand, according to supporters of the BIG BANG models originally proposed by George GAMOW , Ralph Alpher (1921– ) and Robert Herman (1914–97), the whole Universe was created in a single instant about 20 billion years ago and is presently expanding (the mod- ern consensus value is about 15 billion years). In the future it may continue to expand or possibly collapse back on itself depending on the total amount of matter and energy in it, that is, whether or not the Universe is open or closed. An important cosmological question is the MISS - ING MASS PROBLEM : the amount of matter we see in the Universe is far smaller (by a factor of about 100) than the amount we infer from the motions of the galaxies. Definitive observations to discriminate between cosmo- logical models are hard to make. The most informative parts of the Universe are those farthest away. Unfortunate- ly, the objects we observe in such regions are faint and their nature is unknown. It is extremely difficult to tell to what extent quasars, for example, are similar to the nearer – and more familiar – objects. And if we cannot make compar- isons, we cannot use them as standards to test cosmologi- cal models. It is also not known if our Earth-derived physical laws are applicable in the Universe at large. Cosmologists have made several important discoveries, including an attempt to determine the Hubble constant. The DECELERATION PARAMETER , which determines whether the Universe will expand for ever or eventually collapse back on itself, has also been estimated. Recent observations of supernovae have shed some light on the v alues of these important cosmological parameters. They indicate that the Universe is probably accelerating and will never collapse back again. Another important discovery in cosmology was the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND radiation, which pro- vided strong evidence against the steady-state theory. Its discovery also brought with it problems of its own: we do not understand how this background radiation can be so uniform in all directions when it comes from different parts of the Universe that have never been in communica- tion with each other. Attempts have been made to invoke a ve ry rapid period of expansion in the Universe’s history in order to remove this difficulty (the so-called inflationary universe), but these attempts appear to many cosmolo- g ists to be less than convincing ( see INFLATION ). 103 C \u0001 cosmological constant A supernova (arrowed) in a high-redshift galaxy, imaged by the Hubble Space T elescope.

CPD Abbreviation of CAPE PHOTOGRAPHIC DURCH - MUSTERUNG Crab Nebula (M1, NGC 1952) SUPERNOVA REMNANT some 6500 l.y. away and located in Taurus (RA 05 h 34 m .5 dec. \u0001 22º00 \u0002 ) about a degree from \u0003 T au. On 1054 July 4 Chinese astronomers recorded a ‘guest star’ in what is now the constellation Taurus. The star shone about as brightly as the planet Venus, being visible even in daylight. Surprisingly few records of so prominent an object have been found elsewhere in the world, though diligent searches are turning up some, including two rock engravings in the southwestern United States that may depict the supernova near the crescent moon. T oday the remnant of that explosion can be seen as an EMISSION NEBULA , a cloud of gas that originated in the star itself and now has expanded to a size of about 8 \u0004 12 l.y. That nebula bears various names: Messier 1, NGC1952, T aurus A and Taurus X-1. The name by which it is best known, however, is the Crab Nebula. Lord R OSSE named it for its visual resemblance to a crab when observed through his 72-inch (1.8-m) reflector. The Crab Nebula is a supernova remnant – the nebula, radio and/or X-ray source left over from a supernova. Supernova remnants usually take the form of an expand- ing, hollow shell. The Crab Nebula, however, emits from its centre outwards, and is a member of a very rare group of remnants known as PLERIONS or filled supernova remnants. A supernova’s material is ejected at speeds of typically 10,000 km/s (6000 mi/s), so that it rams violently into the surrounding interstellar gas. The effect of this continuous collision is to keep the gas hot long after the supernova explosion. The gas is warmed to several million degrees, emitting light and X-rays. In so doing, the gas is slowed down, so that eventually the remnant ceases to glow. Depending on its environment, a supernova remnant may shine for tens of thousands of years. The Crab Nebula is, therefore, a relatively young specimen. The nature of the explosion is such that the gas forms filamentary structures. The filaments give old supernova remnants a wispy appearance. In the Crab, the filaments are indeed present: on colour photographs they glow with the characteristic red of hot hydrogen, like strands of red cotton wrapped around a soft yellow glow. It is the yellow glow that is distinctive in the case of the Crab Nebula. Within the filaments is an ionized gas in which electrons, freed from their parent atoms, are spiraling in intense magnetic fields and emitting SYNCHROTRON RADIATION . The Crab Nebula is exceptional amongst plerions because the synchrotron radiation extends from the radio domain to the visible. It is the only synchrotron nebula that can be seen in a small telescope. In order to emit at such short wavelengths, the electrons must be very ener- getic indeed. The very act of producing synchrotron radi- a tion removes energy from the electrons, so in the Crab Nebula there has to be a continuing supply of energetic electrons now, 900 years after the star was seen to explode. The source of these energetic electrons is the NEUTRON STAR or PULSAR found at the centre of the nebu- Cosmos satellite 104 C \u0001 Crab Nebula The remnant of a supernova that exploded in the constellation of Taurus in 1054.

The CRAB PULSAR , spinning at the rate of 30 times per second, continuously sprays out both radiation and elec- trons to replenish the synchrotron radiation. The Crab Nebula holds other surprises yet. Only recent- ly a very faint extension was noted from its northern edge – a broad, parallel-sided jet of gas. The origin of this jet is still obscure. Various theories have been proposed, but none seems quite convincing at present. The Crab Nebula cer- tainly will retain a vital place in the study of supernovae and supernova remnants for a considerable time. Crab Pulsar Pulsar with a period of 0 s .033 at the heart of the CRAB NEBULA (Ml). It is the remains of the supernova of 1054, and its discovery confirmed that PULSARS are related to NEUTRON STARS . The Crab Pulsar is one of very few pul- sars to be identified optically, and it has been seen to pulse in the optical, X-ray (with the EINSTEIN OBSERVATORY ) and gamma-ray (with the COMPTON GAMMA RAY OBSERVATORY ) regions, with the same period. In between the main pulse there is another weak pulse, called the inter-pulse. The HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE has taken a remarkable picture (at optical wavelengths) of the pulsar in which knots of gas can be seen in the pulsar jet, and wisps of gas are seen like r ipples on a pond or a whirlpool. These are very variable. Crabtree, William (1610–44) English cloth-merchant, apparently self-taught in astronomy. By 1636 he had become conversant with the researches of Galileo, J ohannes Kepler, Pierre Gassendi and René Descartes (1596–1650), owned a telescope and several other astro- nomical instruments, and had become the centre of a g roup of astronomical correspondents in north-west Eng- land that included Jeremiah HORROCKS , William GAS - COIGNE and Christopher Towneley (1604–74). Crabtree used his observations of eclipses, occultations and sunspots to advance the Copernican system. In 1639 he and Horrocks observed, from Salford, Lancashire, the first recorded transit of Venus across the Sun’s disk. Crater See feature article crater Circular depression on the surface of a planet, satellite or other Solar System body. The term is typically applied to features of volcanic or impact origin. Volcanic craters are steep-walled depressions at the top or on the flanks of a volcano; they are often the major vents for eruption. They are the result of explosions or collapse at the top of a volcanic conduit. Impact craters are observed on all kinds of surface; they are formed by high velocity collisions of interplanetary bodies. A primary impact crater is typically surrounded by a concentric zone of blocky and hummocky terrain formed by EJECTA . Larger ejecta fragments may produce secondary craters. On bodies lacking an atmosphere, even MICROMETE - ORITES may produce impact craters, known as micro- craters, less than a micrometre in diameter. Where an a tmosphere is present, its thickness determines the mini- mum possible crater size. On Venus, with its thick, dense a tmosphere, the smallest primary impact craters are a few kilometres in diameter. Mars’ rarefied atmosphere, howev- er, leads to a minimum size of between 10 and 15 metres. High-velocity passage through an atmosphere often results in fragmentation of an impactor. If break-up happens close to the planet’s solid surface, so that the impactor frag- ments’ high velocity is retained, primary impact craters smaller than the above limits may form. Impact craters show changes in structure as a function of their size. Rela- tively small craters (usually less than 1 km in diameter) are typically bowl-shaped. Larger ones have an uplifted floor. Still larger craters have a central peak on their floor. The largest (tens, hundreds to a few thousand kilometres across) have concentric rings on their floor and are known as multi-ring BASINS . The diameter at which there is a tran- sition from one type of crater structure to another one depends on the nature of the target material (for example rock or ice) and on the target body’s gravitational accelera- tion. For example, the onset diameter of central-peaked craters is 8–15 km (5–9 mi) on Venus, 10–20 km (6–12 mi) on Mercury, 5–15 km (3–9 mi) on Mars, and 25–40 km (16–25 mi) on the Moon ( see CRATER , LUNAR ). crater, lunar Roughly circular depression seen on all parts of the lunar surface. Craters range from microme- tre-size features (microcraters), which are known from examination of lunar samples returned to Earth by APOL - LO astronauts and LUNA robotic missions, to so-called multi-ring BASINS , the largest of which is about 2500 km (1600 mi) in diameter. On the whole Moon, numbers of CRATERS larger than 1000, 100, 10 and 1 km in diameter are, respectively, two, more than 200, c .10 4 and c .10 6 . This close to power function extends to smaller sizes. The shapes and structures of most craters show system- a tic variations with crater size. Craters with diameters g reater than 10 km (6 mi) generally have prominent rims raised above the surrounding terrain. Some large craters are quite pristine and show morphological changes as their sizes increase. Craters with diameters smaller than 15–20 km (9–12 mi) are bowl-shaped. Above this size, pristine craters have flattened floors with hummocky sur- faces. Craters larger than 25–40 km (16–25 mi) have a mountain at the centre of the flat floor and are known as central peak craters. At larger diameters, greater than 100–120 km (62–75 mi), the central peak is surrounded by a fragmentary ring of smaller peaks; such craters are known as central peak basins. Craters with diameters g reater than 200–300 km (120–190 mi) have one or more concentric rings of peaks but lack a central peak; they are known as peak-ring and multi-ring basins. Bowl-shaped craters are often called simple craters, and those with a flat- tened floor and central peaks are called complex craters. Inner slopes of complex craters are steep, often with char- acteristic terraces formed by slumping and sliding. Many large craters are filled with EJECTA from other craters, which partly or completely bury their interior structures. The outer flanks of the rims of large lunar craters are gently sloping; they consist of hummocky terrain, which g rades back to the general (pre-crater) level. Beyond the hummocky terrain region are sometimes found large numbers of small, irregular SECONDARY CRATERS , which often occur in groups and lines elongated roughly radial or concentric to the main, or primary, crater. Even farther out from the primary crater rim, roughly radial patterns of brightening of the surface, known as RAYS , are visible when the Sun is high over the horizon. In plan view, the primary crater rims may range from nearly circular, through polygonal, to quite irregular. Small craters, in the size range from 10 km (6 mi) down to a few centimetres, generally have simple bowl-like shapes. The inner walls are usually smooth, with occasion- al outcrops of bedrock; they show only minor modification 105 C \u0001 Crab Pulsar Optical variations in the Crab Pulsar are seen in this series of High T ime Resolution (HIT) mode images from the Very Large T elescope (VLT).

Flat floors and central mounds are rare. In plan view, the majority of small craters are near circular; some are elongated in a manner that is typical for sec- ondary craters and for craters associated with lunar SINU - OUS RILLES . Small craters show obvious progression from fresh-looking, morphologically prominent and relatively deep forms to subdued shallow features that are obviously a result of crater degradation due to impact ‘ GARDENING ’ and slumping. Some of the smallest craters (microcraters) seen on fragments of rocks and minerals have smooth inte- r iors and rounded rims, showing evidence of plastic flow. The morphological features of most craters – raised r ims and hummocky exteriors – are consistent with the idea that they were formed by some explosive process that excavated material from the depression and deposited it to form the crater rim and ejecta blanket. The depletion in v olatiles of lunar rocks argues against a volcanic-type explosion, while the systematic presence of meteoritic material in the ejecta of small ( REGOLITH ) and large (high- land BRECCIA ) craters suggests that the crater-forming explosions resulted from HYPERVELOCITY IMPACTS of METEOROIDS . This idea agrees well with the close to ran- dom distribution of primary craters on the homogeneous- ly aged surface of the Moon. Large fragments of the target material, thrown out at a relatively high speed, form sec- ondary craters, while smaller particles, thrown out with even higher speed, produce the bright rays. V olcanic eruptions almost certainly occurred on the Moon, producing the extensive areas of dark deposits that can be seen thinly covering the surface in some places. These deposits are sometimes observed in association with kilometre-size shallow craters, which are known as dark-haloed craters. These craters are good candidates for v olcanic landforms, especially those located along rilles or in straight lines, similar to those located on the floor of the crater ALPHONSUS , or those spatially associated with source areas of the youngest volcanism. Some kilometre- size and smaller rimless craters, especially those in associa- tion with fractures and cracks, may have formed by drainage of material into subsurface openings. It is now considered certain that the great majority of lunar craters are of impact origin, although many large craters were subsequently modified by volcanic and TEC - T ONIC processes. The most obvious example is the exten- sive flooding by lava flows of the large basins on the side facing the Earth. This process, which happened mainly between 4000 and 3000 million years ago, led to the for- mation of circular lunar maria, for example Mare IMBRI - UM and Mare CRISIUM . The relative numbers of craters of a given size seen on different parts of the surface has been used to obtain rela- tive ages of the terrains: the older a surface is, the greater the degree of cratering. Also, when ejecta from a crater is seen to lie on top of other features it provides a time mark- er for those features. By combining these relative ages with absolute ages measured on rocks returned to Earth, the calibration function of transformation of relative numbers of craters of a given size into millions and billions of years has been worked out. This calibration curve can be applied to other bodies and serves as the only technique now available to estimate absolute ages of different ter- rains throughout the Solar System; major events on differ- ent planets and satellites can be correlated in time.

Its main instruments are the 2.6-m (104-in.) Shajn Telescope (commissioned in 1961), two 1.25-m (50-in.) tele- scopes, and a large gamma-ray telescope having 48 mir- rors and a total collecting area of 54 m 2 (580 sq ft). The observatory also operates a 22-m (72 ft) radio telescope near Simeiz. C ring Innermost of the rings of SATURN visible from Earth.

Crisium, Mare (Sea of Crises) Lunar lava plain, roughly 500 km (310 mi) in diameter, located in the north-east quadrant of the Moon. The region’s geology reveals that an enormous impact struck the area, producing a multi- r ing impact BASIN . At a later time, lavas flooded the inner areas of the basin, but were generally contained by an inner ring, which is the shape of the present mare. This feature appears oblong due to foreshortening, though its actual shape is more hexagonal. A shelf lies just inside the margin, marking an inner ring of Crisium. Crêpe ring 106 C CRUX ( GEN .

With Philip Herbert Cowell (1870–1949), he used improved meth- ods, based on a combination of mathematical theory and actual observations, to predict the perihelion date of Hal- ley’s Comet at its 1910 apparition. The prediction was accurate to within 3 days, far exceeding the accuracy of predictions for prior returns of the comet.

The identity of this as a single object seen at different returns was not established until 1928, when a comet found by G. Forbes was shown by Andrew CROMMELIN to have the same orbital elements. Initially designated Pons–Cog- gia–Winnecke–Forbes, the comet was renamed Crom- melin in 1948. The comet was recovered in 1956 only 10º from the expected position by Ludmilla Pajdusáková (1916–79) and Michael Hendrie (1931– ). 27P/Crom- melin has an orbital period of 27.4 years, and its most recent return in 1983–84 was used to test observing pro- grammes ahead of 1P/Halley’s 1986 perihelion. crossed lens Convex lens designed to minimize SPHERI - CAL ABERRATION .

He found that ‘spiral nebulae’ were scarce along the galactic plane (the ZONE OF AVOIDANCE ) and that many spirals showed dark dust lanes along their horizontal planes, similar to the Milky Way’s. These observations and his spectroscopic work convinced him that the bright, dif- fuse nebulae resided inside our Galaxy, but that the ‘spiral nebulae’ were other galaxies lying at much greater dis- tances. This was at variance with the ‘metagalaxy’ model proposed by Harlow SHAPLEY ( see GREAT DEBATE ). Curtis became director of the Allegheny Observatory (1920–30), where he designed and built a wide variety of astronomical equipment, including ‘measuring engines’ to obtain precise positions of celestial objects from photographic plates, and specialized instruments for observing solar eclipses. During the 1925 total eclipse expedition to New Haven, Connecticut, he became the first to obtain an infrared spectrum of the solar corona and chromosphere.

Mass-energy curves or distorts spacetime, and particle paths are con- strained to follow this curvature. If a particle is observed approaching the Sun, it appears to be attracted to the Sun by some force, or, equivalently, its path is seen to alter because of the curvature of spacetime around the Sun. cusp Either of the two pointed extremities, or ‘horns’, of the Moon or an inferior planet when at its CRESCENT phase.

They were discovered 1813 December 29 by the German astronomer Franz Paula von Gruithuisen (1744–1852), who imagined them to be the polar snows. They have been extensively observed (1877–82) by Éti- enne Léopold Trouvelot (1827–95) and many others since. At first thought to be illusory, the cusp caps feature conspicuously on photographs taken in ultraviolet by Frank E. Ross at Mount Wilson during the favourable evening elongation of 1927. They are now identified with the bright polar cloud swirls imaged by the MARINER 10 and PIONEER VENUS space probes. The caps vary in brightness, shape, size and position; sometimes they are seen at both poles, at others at one alone.

The blue supergiant is around 30 times as massive as the Sun, and the invisible compan- ion has a mass of around 10 solar masses, which is too big for a white dwarf or a neutron star, so it may be a black hole. The X-rays sometimes vary in intensity on a time- scale of milliseconds. Cygnus X-1 is also a radio source.

Cyrillus P olygonal lunar crater, 97 km (60 mi) in diameter. With CATHARINA , it is a member of the THEOPHILUS chain. Its north-east wall is overlapped by the y ounger impact crater Theophilus. Cyrillus’ east rim is straightened, and its interior walls gradually slope to the floor, which is broken at two places by lengthy landslips parallel to the outer ramparts. The west rim of Cyrillus is cut by a long north–south cleft; a long, curvy ridge abuts the north-east walls. Cyrillus adjoins Catharina through a wide, shallow valley that cuts through its south wall. The floor of Cyrillus shows much detail, including a group of three mountains lying east of centre. Although quite large, these mountains are lower and more heavily eroded than Theophilus’ central mountains, thus proving that Cyrillus is the older crater.

Its brightest star, DENEB , is an immensely luminous supergiant, a member of the so-called SUMMER TRIANGLE . \u0002 Cyg, better known as ALBIREO , is a beautiful coloured double for the smallest apertures, while 61 Cyg is an easy pair of orange dwarfs ( see SIXTY - ONE CYGNI ). CHI CYGNI is a red MIRA STAR , ranging between mags. 3.3 and 14 with a period of about 400 days; P CYGNI is a highly luminous variable. Cygnus lies in the Milky Way and contains rich starfields. Its largest nebula is the CYGNUS RIFT , a dark cloud that bifurcates the Milky Way as it heads south. Near Deneb is the NORTH AMERICA NEBULA , NGC 7000, while near \u0003 Cyg is the VEIL NEBULA , a supernova remnant. M39 is a large open star cluster easily seen in binoculars and just on the naked-eye limit. NGC 6826 is an 8th-magnitude planetary nebula popularly known as the BLINKING PLANETARY . Two celebrated objects in Cygnus within reach only of professional instruments are CYGNUS X -1, a black hole X-ray source that is in orbit around a visible star, and CYGNUS A , a strong radio source thought to be two galaxies in collision.

Dall–Kirkham telescope Va riation of the CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE in which the primary is a concave prolate ELLIPSOID and the secondary is a convex sphere. This design is optically inferior to the Cassegrain, suffering from more severe COMA and FIELD CURVATURE . However, the spherical curve on the secondary is far easier to manufacture than the convex hyperboloid in the Cassegrain. The English master optician Horace Edward Stafford Dall (1901–86) invented this design in 1928. It was the subject of correspondence between Oregon amateur telescope-maker Allan Kirkham and Albert G. INGALLS , then editor of Scientific American , who named it the Dall–Kirkham. Damocles Large ASTEROID , number 5335, discovered in 1991; it occupies a comet-like orbit. Damocles is about 10 km (6 mi) in size. It has perihelion at just below 1.6 AU, meaning that it reaches Mars’ orbit, and aphelion at 22 AU, just beyond Uranus. This orbit is quite unlike that of any asteroid previously known, and its large inclination (62º) is also unusual. Damocles displays none of the activity characteristic of a comet, however, and so may be a devolatilized cometary nucleus. Dynamically, it may represent a later state of the orbital evolution of the CENTAURS .

From the 1920s he developed accurate pho- tometers (and established the DANJON SCALE ), and in 1951 he invented the Danjon astrolabe , an accurate transit instrument used for measuring star positions. Danjon scale Fairly arbitrary five-point scale devised by the French astronomer Andre Danjon, used to describe the relative darkness of LUNAR ECLIPSES . The scale ranges from 0, a very dark eclipse, during which the Moon almost becomes invisible, to 4, which indicates a bright eclipse, where the Moon may show a strong red colour but remains easily visible. Variations in the eclipsed Moon’s brightness from one event to another result mainly from the changing dust and cloud content of Earth’s atmosphere. Eclipses that follow major volcanic eruptions are often notably dark. dark matter General term used to describe matter that is not seen in astrophysical systems but that is thought to be present for other reasons. The rotation curves of galaxies indicate that more mass is present in the galactic haloes than we actually see, so this matter must not be emitting large amounts of light – hence the term ‘dark’ matter. Another use of dark matter is in closing the Uni- verse. See also CLOSED UNIVERSE ; CRITICAL DENSITY ; DENSITY PARAMETER dark adaptation Physiological alteration of the eye’s response to light in low-light environments. On moving from a well-lit area to darkness, the eye’s pupil dilates to a maximum diameter of about 7 mm in a few seconds, but one still cannot see very well. Almost immediately the eye begins to manufacture rhodopsin (also called visual pur- ple), a chemical that increases the eye’s sensitivity by a fac- tor of many thousands. In uninterrupted darkness rhodopsin will continue to build up for as long as 2 hours, but dark adaptation is largely complete after 30 minutes. dark nebula (absorption nebula) Cloud of dust and cool gas that is visible only because it blocks off the light of stars and nebulae beyond it. Dark nebulae range in size from minute, more or less spherical Bok GLOBULES , usual- ly seen in photographs against the bright glow of EMISSION NEBULAE , through larger features like the HORSEHEAD NEB - ULA to the naked-eye clouds of the southern COALSACK and the gigantic RHO OPHIUCHI DARK CLOUD , which affects 1000 square degrees (2%) of the sky. The clouds consist of a mixture of dusty particles and gas, the whole having a composition similar to the standard COSMIC ABUNDANCE of about 75% hydrogen and 23% helium with the rest heavier elements. The dust particles are probably less than a micrometre in size and comprise only about 0.1% of the mass of a cloud. The particles are, however, believed to play an important part in the formation of molecules in space. The outside of the dust particles provides a surface to which atoms within the cloud can adhere and perhaps combine with others to form simple molecules, such as H 2 , or much more complicated compounds, such as formaldehyde or even amino acids ( see COSMOCHEMISTRY and INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES ). These relatively fragile compounds are protected from energetic ultraviolet radiation from stars by the cloud itself. The interiors of these molecular clouds are thus very cold, typically only 10 K, which allows them gradually to collapse under their own gravity, and eventually to begin the process of star formation.

The archiving function of data centres is also important. A prime purpose of astronomical data centres is to maintain and correlate electronic versions of the thousands of CATA - LOGUES of celestial objects. The first such centre was established at Strasbourg, France, with the aim of collat- ing all the various identifications of the same objects in dif- ferent catalogues. Now called the CENTRE DE DONNÉES ASTRONOMIQUES DE STRASBOURG , it maintains the world’s main database for astronomical objects. NASA has a number of data centres. They include the astronomical data center; the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC), at Caltech, Los Angeles, which maintains the National Extragalactic Database (NED); and the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC), which provides access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space physics, solar physics, lunar and planetary data from NASA missions. It also maintains the Astrophysics Data System (ADS), a major abstracting service. Other centres include the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC), and the Astronomical Data Analysis Center (ADAC) run by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Davida Fifth-largest MAIN - BELT ASTEROID ; number 511. Davida was discovered in 1903. It has a diameter of about 325 km (202 mi). David Dunlap Observatory (DDO) Research centre of the University of Toronto, Canada, situated at Richmond Hill, Ontario some 20 km (12 mi) north of Toronto, opened in 1935. The DDO was funded through a bequest from the estate of David Dunlap (1863–1924), a wealthy Ontario amateur astronomer. Its principal instrument is a 1.88-m (74-in.) reflector, which was the world’s second- largest telescope when it was built. Today’s University of T oronto astronomers carry out their research with major international facilities such as the CANADA – FRANCE – HAWAII TELESCOPE and the GEMINI OBSERVATORY . Dawes, William Rutter (1799–1868) English physician, clergyman and amateur double-star observer who devised the empirical formula used to measure telescope resolution ( see DA WES ’ LIMIT ). He established a private observatory in Lancashire (1829) where he measured the distance and separation of more than 200 double stars, acquiring the nickname the Eagle-eyed because of his acute vision. Later, Dawes made systematic observations of the planets, espe- cially Mars and Jupiter, and in 1850 independently discov- ered Saturn’s semi-transparent Crepe Ring (the C RING ). Dawes’ limit Theoretical limit of RESOLVING POWER for a telescope, given by the formula R = 115.8/ D or R = 4.56/ D \u0002 where R is the angular resolution in arcseconds, D the diameter in millimetres and D \u0002 the diameter in inches. Dawes’ limit applies to the angular separation of two stars of equal magnitude under conditions of perfect seeing. In practice, Dawes’ limit is never reached, mainly because of a tmospheric turbulence. day Time taken for the Earth to complete one rotation on its axis. It can be measured in a number of different ways. A SIDEREAL DAY is the interval between two successive passages across the MERIDIAN of the FIRST POINT OF ARIES (the zero of RIGHT ASCENSION ) and is equivalent to 23 h 56 m 4 s .091. It is considered to be a true measure of the rotation period because the stars, which are used as reference points, are so far away that in this context they may be regarded as infinitely remote. An apparent solar day is the interval between two successive passages across the meridian of the true Sun. Its length is not uniform, however. Due to the Earth’s elliptical orbit, and the fact that the Sun appears to move along the ecliptic rather than the celestial equator, an apparent solar day varies by as much as 16 minutes during the course of a year ( see APPARENT SOLAR TIME ). A mean solar day is the interval between two successive passages across the meridian of a fictitious, or MEAN SUN ( see MEAN SOLAR TIME ). Because of the Sun’s movement relative to the background stars, at a rate of about one degree per day in an easterly direction, the mean solar day is slightly longer than a sidereal day, at 24 h 3 m 56 s .555. A civil day begins and ends at midnight and comprises two 12-hour periods, am and pm. These are never used in an astronomical context, however, where the 24-hour clock is always quoted. daylight meteor stream METEOR STREAM that pro- duces activity from a RADIANT too close to the Sun in the sky to allow direct (visual or photographic) observations. Instead, the METEOR SHOWER associated with the stream has to be observed by radio methods. Notable examples include the BETA TAURIDS and the Daytime Arietids, both of which are active during June. decametric radiation RADIO WAVES having wavelengths of a few tens of metres or a few decametres, that is, from 10 up to l00 m (30 to 3 MHz). It includes most HF radio frequencies and the upper part of the MF band. deceleration parameter Measure of the change in the expansion velocity of the Universe as a function of time. The deceleration parameter can be calculated by q 0 = 4 \u0003\u0004 G /2 H 0 2 = \u0005 ( d 2 R 0 / dt 2 ) R 0 H 0 2 where H 0 is the HUBBLE CONSTANT and \u0004 is the density of the Universe. If q 0 = 0 the Universe is flat and expands at a constant speed for ever.

When an astronomical object is observed with any instrument (such as a telescope plus detector, for example), the instrument smears the radia- tion in its own characteristic way. The most obvious examples are the spiking seen on the optical images of bright stars, caused by the spider support for the sec- ondary mirror, and the broad spots on the image rather than single points for the stellar images. The process of removing the effect of the instrument is called deconvolu- tion, and it involves understanding and modelling the effects very thoroughly with a computer. The instrumen- tal effect (the instrumental profile) is often approximated by a Gaussian distribution function because this is easy to correct computationally. decoupling era Pe r iod when matter began to evolve separately from the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND . During the early stages of the BIG BANG , the universe was much smaller, denser and hotter than it is now, and it was essentially radiation dominated. The photon density was so high that the formation of normal atoms and molecules w as not possible. As the universe expanded and cooled, the radiation density decreased more rapidly than the mat- ter density, and after several thousand years the universe became optically thin to radiation, and matter evolved separately from the background radiation. This transition is called decoupling and this era can be studied through the cosmic microwave background radiation. Deep Impact NASA Discovery-class mission, to be launched in 2004 January, to impact a 498-kg instru- mented cylindrical copper projectile into the nucleus of Comet 9P/Tempel 1 in 2005 July. The impact, at a speed of 32,200 km/h (20,000 mph), will create a 100-m (330-ft) diameter, 8-m (26-ft) deep crater, exposing pris- tine interior material and debris from the comet, which will be studied by a high-resolution camera and an infrared spectrometer on the mother craft and by g round- and space-based observatories. deep sky Expression used to define a celestial body that lies outside the Solar System. It can be applied to both galactic and extra-galactic objects such as star clusters, nebulae and galaxies, which are referred to as deep sky objects ; it is rarely used to describe individual stars. Deep Space 1 (DS 1) First of NASA’s NEW MILLENNI - UM programme missions, launched in 1998 October, to demonstrate new technologies, including an ion propul- sion system, an autonomous navigation system and an autonomous spacecraft computer, nicknamed the Con- troller. The NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINIS - TRATION (NASA) hopes such technologies will enable future science craft to be smaller, less expensive, more autonomous and capable of independent decision mak- ing, relying less on ground control. DS 1’s rendezvous with the asteroid 9969 BRAILLE at a distance of 15 km (9.3 mi) in 1999 July accomplished the prime objective of the mission, although an imaging system malfunction pre- v ented any good images being taken. DS 1 was then directed towards a bonus target – a rendezvous with Comet 19P/Borrelly in 2001 September. On the way to the comet, however, DS 1 experienced a serious problem when its star tracker was lost. A remarkable recovery by engineers, who reconfigured computer software on the spacecraft, enabled control to be restored. Deep Space Network (DSN) Three Deep Space Communications Complexes used by NASA to track and communicate with space probes; they are operated by the JET PROPULSION LABORATORY . The first to be completed, in 1966, is the Goldstone Tracking Station in California’s Mojave Desert, near Goldstone Dry Lake, about 70 km north of Barstow. The other two are at Robledo de Chavella, 60 km west of Madrid, Spain, and at Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, 40 km south-west of Canberra, Australia. Between them, they can maintain contact with space probes as the Earth rotates. Each complex has two 34-m (110-ft) antennas, one 26-m (85-ft) antenna and one 70-m (200-ft) antenna, which can also be used as radio telescopes and for radar observations of nearby planets. defect of illumination Proportion of the disk of a plan- etary body that does not appear illuminated to an observer on Earth; measured as an angle in arcseconds. Also known as the TERMINATOR phase, the defect of illumination defines how much of a geometrical planetary disk is in darkness. It can also be expressed in terms of the angle of the terminator or the ratio of illuminated to non-illuminated areas. At OPPOSITION , there is no perceptible defect of illumination. deferent In the PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM and earlier systems, the large circle centred on the Earth, around which was supposed to move the centre of a small circle, the EPICY - CLE , around which a planet moved. degenerate matter Matter that is so dense, atomic particles are packed together until quantum effects sup- port the material. Material within WHITE DWARFS and NEUTRON STARS is degenerate. At the enormous temperatures and pressures that exist at the centres of stars, atoms are stripped of almost all of their electrons, leaving a gas of nuclei and electrons. Because these particles are much smaller than atoms, such a gas can be compressed to much higher densities than an D degenerate matter 111 \u0001 Deep Space 1 T est firing of the xenon ion engine of Deep Space 1.

However, the PA ULI EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE , which states that no FERMION can exist in the same quantum state, prevents particles getting too close together. In white dwarfs, or the centres of GIANT STARS and low-mass DW ARF STARS , the electrons are degenerate; in neutron stars it is the neutrons that exert the degeneracy pressure. In degenerate matter the motions of the constituent particles are not determined by temperature, as they are in a normal gas, so a degenerate gas does not obey the usual gas laws. Degeneracy pressure is a function only of density. If energy is put into a degenerate gas the temperature r ises, this being achieved by a fraction of the particles with previously restricted velocities moving to higher and unrestricted states. At a sufficiently high temperature all of the particles are removed from their degenerate condition. Degeneracy, therefore, can exist only at temperatures below what is called the Fermi temperature.

Angular measure is used widely in astronomy to determine the diameter or separation of celestial objects. Deimos Smaller of the two moons of MARS , the other being PHOBOS , discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall. Deimos is irregular in shape, measuring about 15 \u0003 12 \u0003 10 km (9 \u0003 7 \u0003 6m i), with a mass of 1.8 \u0003 10 18 kg, g iving it an average density of 1.7 g/cm 3 . It has a near- circular orbit tilted at an angle of 1º.8 to Mars’ equator, at a distance of 23,460 km (14,580 mi) from the centre of the planet. This gives it an orbital period of 1.262 days, compared to the 1.026 days it takes Mars to rotate on its axis; in consequence, an observer on the surface of the planet would see Deimos moving slowly westwards across the sky, whereas Phobos would appear to move more rapidly eastwards. Deimos is a dark body (albedo 0.05), slightly red in coloration, and so is thought to be a captured ASTEROID with a composition similar to a CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITE . It is locked in SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION with Mars, such that its long axis is radially aligned with the planet. It shares these characteristics with its companion, Phobos. De La Rue, Warren (1815–89) British printer and ama- teur astronomer, born in Guernsey, a pioneer of solar astronomy and ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY . Realizing that pho- tography could bring out detail invisible to the eye, and pro- vided permanent, objective records of features that could be drawn only with questionable reliability, De La Rue sought to improve photography of the Sun and Moon. He adapted his telescope to hold newly developed wet collodion photo- g raphic plates, and in the 1850s took remarkably detailed images of the Moon. In 1858, to photograph the Sun, he b uilt an instrument he called a photoheliograph, and used it to prove that the prominences observed during total solar eclipses were produced by the Sun itself.

The range of light amplitudes is from mag. 0.003 to 0.9 V, but is usually only several hundredths of a magnitude. Delta Scuti stars are of spectral types A0–F6 and luminosity classes III–V. Light-curve shape, ampli- tude and period vary, with some stars having only spo- radic variations, which on occasions cease entirely as a result of strong amplitude modulations. Delta Scuti stars have radial and non-radial pulsations. The maximum expansion of surface layers does not lag behind maximum light for more than 0 p .1. These stars are found in the lower part of the Cepheid INSTABILITY STRIP . They are sometimes referred to as ultra-short-period Cepheids or as dwarf Cepheids, although the latter term is also applied to the AI VELORUM STARS .

The average density of a body is its total mass divided by its total volume. Substances that are light for their size have a low density and vice versa. Water has a density of 1000 kg/m 3 under standard conditions. A wide va ri a tion in density is found throughout the Universe, ranging from about l0 \u0001 20 kg/m 3 for the interstellar gas to ov er 10 17 kg/m 3 for neutron stars.

The density wave theory, worked out by Chia Chiao Lin (1916– ) and Frank Shu (1943– ), identifies kinds of wave patterns that can propagate as coherent spirals through disks. In this theory, spiral arms are patterns through which stars and gas move, with the pattern moving at a different speed. The arms w ould appear enhanced because the extra mass in the arms keeps stars and gas there longer than they would be in the absence of the extra density, and star formation is triggered in molecular clouds by the denser environment. This theo- ry probably applies to ‘grand-design’ spiral galaxies, many of which have close companions whose gravitational per- turbations would excite the requisite density wave. De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (‘On the Revo- lution of the Heavenly Spheres’) Nicholas COPERNICUS ’ masterpiece in which he set forth what is now called the COPERNICAN SYSTEM , his heliocentric theory of the Solar System. Although it was published in 1543, the year of Copernicus’ death, it took more than a century for its cos- mology to become widely accepted. Publication was over- seen by the German theologian Andreas Osiander (1498–1552), who without Copernicus’ knowledge insert- ed a preface stating that the heliocentric Solar System was not real, but merely an aid to calculating planetary posi- tions. But the clear intention of the work itself is to promote a Sun-centred system. Much of De revolutionibus is con- cerned with geometrical derivations and tables for predict- ing the positions of the Sun, Moon and planets. Because the elliptical shape of planetary orbits had not yet been dis- covered, complicated epicycles were still required, as in the PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM , and in that respect the new theory w as not much of an improvement on the previous one.

His double- star observations showed that the speed of light did not depend on source velocity (1913). The de Sitter model , which arose from his solution (1917) of Einstein’s FIELD EQUATIONS of general relativity, was based on a hypotheti- cal universe containing no matter. It suggested that the Universe was expanding, a conclusion that Einstein did not initially accept, choosing instead to ‘prevent’ the expansion mathematically by introducing the COSMOLOG - ICAL CONSTANT . The Einstein–de Sitter model , pro- posed by the two scientists in 1932, is a BIG BANG universe that expands for ever.

De Vaucouleurs, Gerard (1918–95) French-American astronomer (born Gérard Henri de Vaucouleurs), who spent much of his career (1965–95) at the MCDONALD OBSERVATORY , and specialized in galaxies and other aspects of observational cosmology. He measured the brightness and distance for hundreds of galaxies, working largely at MOUNT STROMLO OBSERVATORY (1952–57). From these photometric measurements, he was able to map clusters of galaxies that themselves aggregated to form a ‘local supercluster’. De Vaucouleurs’ observations of galaxy distances suggested a high value for the Hubble constant, around 100 km/s/Mpc, implying a universe that was 50% ‘younger’ than widely believed. de Vico, Comet 122P/ Short-period comet discovered on 1846 February 20 by Francesco de Vico (1805–48), Rome, Italy. During its discovery apparition, the comet reached a peak magnitude \u0001 5.0, but no definitive orbit was calculated. A comet discovered independently on 1995 September 17 by three Japanese observers (Yuji Nakamura, Masaaki Tanaka and Shonju Utsunomiya) was found to be identical to that seen in 1846; the previ- ous return in 1922 April had been missed. Comet 122P/de Vico reached perihelion on 1995 October 6, again attaining peak magnitude \u0001 5.0. The period is now known to be 74.41 years. de Vico–Swift, Comet 54P/ Short-period comet dis- covered on 1844 August 23 by Francesco de Vico (1805–48), Rome, Italy. Its short-period orbit was soon recognized, but poor weather and bad viewing geometry prevented further observations until it was discovered again by Edward Swift on 1894 November 21. Comet 54P/de Vico–Swift was next recovered in 1965 following calculations by Brian Marsden (1937– ) and Joachim Schubart (1928– ). A close passage (0.16 AU) to Jupiter in 1968 increased the comet’s orbital period to 6.3 years; its perihelion distance of 1.62 AU makes it unfavourably faint. dew cap Full-aperture extension placed around the end of a telescope (usually a REFRACTING TELESCOPE or SCHMIDT – CASSEGRAIN ) that shields the front element to limit radiative cooling and subsequent condensation of moisture from the air upon the cold glass. Dew may be prevented from forming if the front element is surrounded by an electrically resistive wire loop giving out about 1–3 W of heat. Such ‘dew zappers’ are popular with ama- teur users of Schmidt–Cassegrain telescopes, and are also used to protect the lenses of cameras used for long-dura- tion exposures in, for example, meteor photography. Dialogues Shortened English name of GALILEO ’s Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi del mondo (‘Dialogue on Two Chief World Systems’). One of Galileo’s most famous works, it was published in 1632 and contained his chief defence of the Copernican viewpoint. It was written in Italian and took the form of a conversation between three friends – Salviati, who represented Galileo’s own point of view, Sagredo, an intelligent gentleman of Venice, and Simplicio, a rather dense Aristotelian. Its publication led to his trial before the Inquisition, for Copernicanism had been proscribed by a papal edict of 1616. diamond-ring effect Spectacle seen at SECOND CON - TACT or THIRD CONTACT – at the beginning or end of TO TALITY – in a total SOLAR ECLIPSE , when a single daz- zling point of the solar disk remains or becomes visible shining through a depression on the Moon’s limb, appear- ing as if mounted on a ring formed by the Sun’s corona.

Dicke, Robert Henry (1916–97) American radio physi- cist who, in 1964, postulated that the Universe is pervaded by a ‘background glow’ of radiation at the microwave fre- quency that is a remnant of the BIG BANG . This was con- firmed in 1964 by Arno PENZIAS and Robert Wilson, who detected radiation at the predicted wavelength of 3.2 cm. In the 1940s Dicke had pioneered the development of microwave radar, and in 1944 he invented the microwave radiometer, a key component of contemporary radio tele- scopes. He was also an accomplished theorist, making many refinements to general relativity, including the BRANS – DICKE THEORY of gravitation. differential rotation Rotation of a gaseous or fluid body at a rate that differs with latitude: the equatorial regions rotate more quickly, and revolve faster, than higher- latitude polar ones.

A solid body like the Earth cannot undergo differential rotation: it must rotate so that the angular velocity and period of rotation is the same everywhere. differentiation Process by which a planetary body develops a layered structure. In a body that grows to a suf- ficient size by A CCRETION , energy supplied by RADIOAC - TIVITY , supplemented by kinetic energy of impacting bodies and gravitational compression, will cause melting in the interior. Under the action of gravity, denser material will sink towards the centre, and less dense material will r ise towards the surface. These displacements release gr a vitational potential energy, heating the body further and causing additional melting; once begun, differentia- tion proceeds to completion on a short timescale. Differ- entiation of a terrestrial planet yields a nickel–iron CORE and rocky MANTLE and CRUST . The larger ice-rich satel- lites of the outer planets have differentiated into rocky cores and icy mantles. The distinct compositions of some METEORITES , consisting of iron and/or igneous minerals, indicate that their parent asteroids differentiated and solidified before being disrupted by impacts. diffraction Slight spreading of a beam of light as it passes a sharp edge. If a beam of light strikes a hole, the beam that passes through the hole spreads slightly at the edges. A similar effect can be observed when waves in the sea hit the narrow opening of a harbour: as they pass into the harbour they begin to spread out. Because their wa v elength is large compared to the harbour entrance the spread is large. The very short wavelength of light means that the effect is rarely noticed unless the opening is extremely small. However, the diffraction of light at the edges of a telescope aperture gives rise to the AIRY DISK observed when a star image is examined at high magnification. The larger the aperture, and the shorter the wavelength, the smaller the Airy disk will be. Diffraction is used to good effect in a DIFFRACTION GRATING , where many very narrow adjacent holes (usually in the form of long slits) cause the spreading light beams to interfere with each other thus producing a SPECTRUM . diffraction grating Optical device used to disperse light into a SPECTRUM by means of a series of closely spaced, equidistant, parallel grooves ruled on to its surface. A typ- ical grating will have several thousand such grooves per centimetre; light striking each individual slit is dispersed by DIFFRACTION into a spectrum. The grooves may be r uled on glass, producing a TRANSMISSION GRATING , or on metal to give a REFLECTION GRATING . Diffraction gratings produce quality high-dispersion spectra and are used in astronomical SPECTROSCOPES and SPECTROGRAPHS . diffuse interstellar band (DIB) Broad ABSORPTION LINES found on ultraviolet, visible and infrared spectra of distant stars (some definitions restrict the term to the lines in the visible range of the spectrum, where the strongest lines are at 443 and 618 nm). Diffuse interstel- lar bands (DIBs) are found especially when the light from the star has been strongly reddened by interstellar dust absorption along the line of sight. Over 200 such lines have now been observed. Some of the DIBs are very broad. For example, the line at 220 nm is some 40 to 50 nm wide. Others are narrower but still broad com- pared with the stellar lines: for example, the DIB at 578 nm is about 2 nm wide, while the stellar lines are 0.1 nm or less. DIBs are clearly closely associated with INTERSTELLAR MATTER b ut their origin is still a matter of debate. Current possible explanations include graphite particles, OH \u0001 radicals on the surfaces of silicate grains, silicate grains themselves, polycyclic aromatic hydrocar- bons (molecules with carbon and hydrogen in hexagonal arrays) and complex carbon molecules such as Buckmin- sterfullerene (C 60 ). An alternative hypothesis suggests that the bands originate when hydrogen molecules absorb two photons simultaneously, the photons can then have a range of energies (that is, the absorption lines will be broad) since it is only the total energy of the two photons that has to equal the exact energy required for the transi- tion. It is likely that there is more than one cause of the DIBs, so several of these suggestions could be correct. See also INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES diffuse nebula Te rm used in the mid-19th century for any nebulous object in the sky that did not resolve into stars when observed at high resolution. It thus included SUPER - NOVA REMNANTS , PLANETARY NEBULAE , REFLECTION NEBU - LAE , distant galaxies and hot gas clouds. Nowadays it is taken to refer only to the hot gas clouds, and it is thus a somewhat archaic synonym for HII REGIONS . Diffuse nebulae absorb ultraviolet radiation emitted by hot stars embedded within them. This IONIZES the atoms within the nebula; the subsequent RECOMBINATION of an ion and electron leads to the emission of the optical radiation. The nebulae vary considerably in general appearance depending upon the distribution of gas and stars within them, but the ORION NEBULA and R OSETTE NEBULA are good examples. Nebulae are often the sites of current or recent star formation. Digges, Leonard ( c .1520–59) and Digges, Thomas ( c .1545–95) English father and son who applied mathe- matical methods to surveying, navigation and ballistics. In 1553 Leonard Digges published A General Prognosti- cation , one of the earliest astronomical almanacs. As well as astronomical data, it contained practical information on instruments and methods, such as finding local time from star positions. Thomas Digges published revised editions of his father’s works. P antometria (1571) covers surveying and cartography and contains what some have interpreted as a description of a reflecting telescope. Prognostication Everlasting (1576) reiterates Leonard’s support of the Sun-centred COPERNICAN SYSTEM , and also makes a case for an INFINITE UNIVERSE . Thomas’ careful observations of Tycho’s Star, the supernova of 1572, coupled with Tycho’s own observations of it, have allowed modern astronomers to identify it with a known supernova remnant.

It was dis- covered in 1684 by G.D. CASSINI . It is known to share its orbit with a small satellite, HELENE , which occupies a sta- ble LAGRANGIAN POINT 60º ahead of it. Helene thus bears the same relationship to Dione as do some of the TROJAN ASTEROIDS to Jupiter. Dione is similar in appearance and size to TETHYS , which has the adjacent orbit inside that of Dione. However, Dione has a wider range of crater densi- ties; this is partly attributable to at least two separate local- ized episodes of cryovolcanic flooding ( see CRYOVOLCANISM ), widely spaced in time, which affected different regions. These episodes may be a result of TIDAL HEATING caused by orbital interaction with ENCELADUS . However, the resurfacing events on Dione must have taken place far longer ago than the most recent resurfac- ing on Enceladus, because even Dione’s least cratered areas have more craters than the most cratered areas on Enceladus.

For motion to be classed as direct, the inclination of the axis of rotation or orbital motion must be less than 90º. The motion of all planets in the Solar System, and most of the satellites, is direct. Direct motion is also the term given to the regular west-to-east motion of bodies in the Solar System when viewed from Earth, relative to the background stars. disconnection event Shearing of a COMET ’s ion tail, resulting from a change in the polarity of the interplane- tary magnetic field. Disconnection events often occur when a comet encounters a sector boundary in the SOLAR WIND ; they are usually followed by the develop- ment of a new, differently oriented ion tail. Comets that appear around the time of sunspot maximum, when the solar wind is particularly turbulent, are especially prone to disconnection events.

Disk galaxies include SPIRAL GALAXIES (ordinary and barred) and LENTICULAR (S0) systems. Some IRREGULAR GALAX - IES also appear to have thin disks in ordered rotation, though their brightness profiles are less regular. Disks are thought to have been formed while material was still in the form of interstellar clouds, rather than dense stars, so that cloud collisions could remove energy and flatten the distri- b ution into the existing disk. dispersion Separation of light into its constituent wave- lengths by refraction or DIFFRACTION ; it is produced by a lens, a prism or a grating. Chromatic dispersion also occurs in fibre-optics, where the speed of propagation is dependent on the colour. dispersion measure Column density of free electrons along the line of sight to an object. In practice it is of con- cern mainly for PULSARS . The radio waves from the pul- sar are delayed by interactions with the free electrons in space, with the lower frequencies being delayed more than the higher ones. Thus an individual pulse from the pulsar will have its high-frequency component received on Earth before the lower-frequency component. The delay between the receptions of the components of a pulse is called the differential dispersion and it increases as the dispersion measure increases.

It is a measure of the distance to an object, though absorption by the interstellar medium must be considered ( see REDDENING ). diurnal motion Apparent daily motion of a heavenly body across the sky from east to west, caused by the axial rotation of the Earth. At the poles, a celestial body appears to describe a circle in the sky parallel to the horizon. At other latitudes it describes an arc from horizon to horizon, the length of which varies with latitude and declination; its angle to the horizon varies with latitude alone. diurnal parallax (geocentric parallax) Difference in the apparent position of a celestial body as measured by an observer at the Earth’s surface and by a hypothetical observer at the centre of the Earth. The Earth’s daily rotation on its axis causes the positions of nearby objects to appear to shift in relation to the background stars. The effect is maximized when an object is on the horizon, but at a minimum if it is on the meridian. It is so small that it is only noticeable for objects within the Solar System. See also ANNUAL PARALLAX ; SOLAR PARALLAX divided telescope (heliometer) Historical instrument for measuring very small angles, consisting of a REFRACTING TELESCOPE with an objective lens cut in half. Each half was mounted on a graduated rack-and- pinion mechanism, so that when the two semi-lenses w ere slid against each other out of a common line of col- limation, the observer saw a split image. The half-lenses w ere mounted with high precision, and the superimposi- tion of their respective images could then be used to accurately measure very tiny angles. John DOLLOND in London began to make divided achromatic lenses for angle-measuring purposes in the 1760s, although it was in the superb HELIOMETERS by Adolf Repsold (1793–1867) of Munich after 1835 that the instrument reached its peak of excellence. Dobsonian telescope NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE equipped with a low, stable ALTAZIMUTH MOUNTING ; its designer, by John Lowry Dobson (1915– ), refers to it as a sidewalk telescope . For amateur instruments, the ‘Dob’ has advantages of economy and is stable enough for useful observation. The design can be applied to large tele- scopes, and has led to modern amateurs using instru- ments with far greater apertures – up to a metre (3 ft) or even more – than were common when it first emerged in the 1950s. A Dobsonian requires no great skill to build, and can be made from very simple parts. The basic features of the mounting are a ground board (or baseplate), topped by Teflon pads on which rests a cradle (or rocker-box). A single loose bolt in the centre of the ground board keeps the cradle in place but allows it to turn in azimuth.

Donati, Comet (C/1858 L1) Br ight long-period comet discovered by G.B. DONATI on 1858 June 2. As it approached perihelion (0.58 AU), on 1858 September 30, Donati’s Comet became spectacular. In early Octo- ber, it reached magnitude \u0001 1, with a striking, curved dust tail stretching for 60º at the time of closest approach to Earth, on October 9. Two narrow ion tails were also evident. The comet was the first to be photographed (by William Usherwood, Surrey, England). It has an orbital period of about 2000 years. Donati, Giovanni Battista (1826–73) Italian astronomer who discovered six comets between 1854 and 1864. The most famous, Donati’s Comet of 1858, was the most widely observed object of its kind, and beauti- fully detailed drawings of it encouraged astronomers to make the first serious studies of cometary morphology. Donati made the first spectroscopic observations of comets, from which, in 1864, he concluded that comet tails were made of gases. Doppler effect Phenomenon whereby the pitch of sound or the wavelength of light is altered by the relative v elocity between the observer and the emitting object. The effect was first described for sound waves in 1842 by the Austrian physicist Christiaan Doppler (1803–53), who was director of the Vienna Physical Institute and pro- fessor at the University of Vienna. The French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau (1819–96) suggested the extension of the principle to light waves in 1848. The Doppler effect can be visualized by imagining a transmitter emitting pulses regularly. Each pulse travels out in all directions, producing a pattern of circles. If the transmitter is moving, each circle has a different centre. In the diagram, circles A, B, C and D were emitted when the source was at a, b, c and d. In the forwards direction the circles lie closer together, whilst behind the transmitter they are stretched apart. In the case of light, if an object approaches, the light it emits has shorter wa ve separations and so becomes bluer; if the object recedes, the light is reddened. The latter is the much referred-to REDSHIFT . The convention is used that radial velocity is positive when directed away, and negative when directed towards the Earth, so the Doppler formula is: where \u0002 0 is the observed wavelength, \u0002 L is the laboratory (that is, unshifted) wavelength, v is the line-of-sight v elocity and c is the velocity of light. Hence the line-of- sight velocity of an object can be determined from measurements of the changed wavelengths of spectrum lines. Most objects have some motion across the line of sight, but the Doppler effect cannot measure these, except at relativistic velocities when the transverse Doppler effect appears as a result of relativistic TIME DILATION . Distant galaxies and quasars recede at speeds approaching that of light itself. The relativistic Doppler formula must then be used, as follows: Dorado See feature article, page 118 \u0002 0 \u0001 \u0002 L = 1 \u0003 v \u0001 1 –– \u0001 c –––––– ––––––– \u0002 L √ 1 v 2 –– c 2 \u0002 0 \u0001 \u0002 L = v ––––– – \u0002 L c D Dorado 117 \u0001 Dobsonian telescope This simple altazimuth mounting has enabled many amateur astronomers to construct large-aperture instruments comparatively cheaply.

The system lies 180 l.y. away. double star Tw o stars that appear close together on the sky. An OPTICAL DOUBLE is a chance alignment: in reality the two stars lie at great distances from each other, but they appear to be close together as seen from the Earth. In physical doubles, or BINARY STARS , the two stars lie close enough together to be gravitationally bound, orbiting about their common centre of mass ( see BARYCENTRE ). doublet Composite LENS made up of two simple lenses. The lenses can be cemented together or separated by a small air gap; doublets are used as ACHROMATS in refract- ing telescopes and as elements in EYEPIECES . DQ Herculis star CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE in which the white dwarf component has an extremely strong magnet- ic field and rotates more rapidly than the orbital revolu- tion (that is, it has non-synchronous rotation). Mass loss occurs from the main-sequence component, and although an ACCRETION DISK may be present, accretion on to the white dwarf occurs primarily through a column at the magnetic poles. There is persistent flickering, together with eclipses in those systems that are aligned with the line of sight. DQ Herculis systems are sometimes known as ‘intermediate polars’. The type star, DQ Herculis, is a 14th-magnitude vari- able star. It is the remnant of Nova Herculis, which rose to first magnitude in 1934 and was classed as a slow nova. It wa s particularly notable for a pronounced dip and recov- ery on the decline. Modern photographs show an expand- ing shell of gas, which was ejected with a velocity of about 1000 km/s (620 miles/s). DQ Herculis is an ECLIPSING BINARY with an orbital period of 4 h 39 m . The primary component is a white dwarf star and the secondary is a normal K or M dwarf (main-sequence star). In addition to eclipses and flickering, DQ Herculis shows regular vari- ations in brightness with a range of a few per cent and a period of 71 s .0745; the variations are thought to be caused by rotation of the white dwarf.

He took some of the best early pho- tographs of the Moon, planets, comets, nebulae and the solar spectrum with a 28-inch (0.71-m) telescope he completed in 1872. That year, he took the first photo- graph of the spectrum of a bright star, Vega. To honour his work with photographic spectroscopy, his name was given to the HENRY DRAPER CATALOGUE , funded by a donation from his widow and astronomical assistant, Mary Palmer Draper (1839–1914). Henry’s father was John William Draper (1811–82), an English scien- tist who emigrated to America in 1832, and some time in the winter of 1839/40 obtained the first photographic image (a Daguerrotype) of the Moon. drawtube Moving portion of a telescope’s focuser.

D ring Innermost part of SATURN ’s r ing system. Not a w ell-defined ring, it is not observable from Earth. drive Mechanism by which a TELESCOPE is moved quickly (slewed) from one part of the sky to another, or moved slowly (tracked) to follow celestial objects in their sidereal motion. A tracking motor can be use to turn the telescope about the polar axis of an EQUATORIAL MOUNTING at the sidereal rate of one revolution per 23 h 56 m . Early ve r sions used clockwork or falling weights to power the drive. Modern drives use electric motors, precisely regulated by quartz crystal oscillators. Typically, the motor drives a worm gear – a spiral cut on the surface of a cylindrical rotating shaft – which engages the teeth of a large gearwheel attached to the polar axis. The gear must be carefully engineered to minimize ‘play’, which is the back-and-forth motion (giving rise to the so-called periodic error) that occurs as first one tooth and then the next touches the worm. The residual errors of the drive mechanism have to be eliminated by the astronomer, who views a GUIDE STAR in an eyepiece and continually makes small positional adjustments by pressing buttons on a handset. These adjustments are necessary to compensate for flexure of the telescope and its mounting as its position changes, for A TMOSPHERIC REFRACTION , and for errors in the gear construction. The most advanced telescope drives use computer control. In such systems, the computer rapidly and repeatedly calculates the required position of the telescope, determining for the time given by a quartz clock the hour angle and altitude of the object that it has been instructed to follow. The computer reads the telescope position from encoders attached to the two mounting axes ( see also GO TO TELESCOPE ). It is possible in principle to attain a pointing accuracy of 1 \u0001 by these methods. The final adjustment of the telescope’s position is made by visual inspection of the field of view, or by measuring the position of a guide star in the field, using a CCD camera.

A common definition has absolute visual magnitude fainter than \u0001 18; by this criterion the MAGELLANIC CLOUDS are not dwarfs but all the other non-spiral mem- bers of the LOCAL GROUP are. Dwarf galaxies are usually spheroidal or irregular in structure, and are often found clustered around brighter galaxies. dwarf nova (DN) CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE that undergoes repeated outbursts. Outbursts are generally similar to those found in a NOVA , but with smaller amplitudes, typically two to six magnitudes. The rise from minimum to maximum takes place in one or two days, and the return to minimum generally takes several days. The average interval, in days, between consecutive maxima is called the mean cycle. Although varying from star to star, each star has its own characteristic mean cycle, which often alters within fairly wide limits. Approximately 370 dwarf novae are known. Physically, dwarf novae consist of a DW ARF STAR or SUBGIANT K or M-type star that fills its R OCHE LOBE and transfers material towards a WHITE DWARF companion, which is surrounded by an A CCRETION DISK . In many sys- tems a hot spot may be observed where the stream of material impacts on the outer edge of the accretion disk. In the variable-star classification scheme, dwarf novae are designated UG. They are divided into three main sub- types in accordance with their optical behaviour. Each sub- type is designated by the name of a type star. The first subtype (UGSS) comprises the SS Cygni or U GEMINO - RUM stars, which are named after the first two dwarf novae discovered. The cycles for stars of this subtype range from ten to several hundred days. Outbursts are termed either normal (short) or wide (long). The first have durations of a few days whereas the second last for up to about 20 days. Occasionally a star will take several days to rise to maxi- mum; such maxima are called anomalous outbursts. Stars of the SU Ursae Majoris subtype (UGSU) have two kinds of outburst: normal outbursts last from one to four days; supermaxima last from ten to 20 days, during which time the star becomes from half to one magnitude brighter than at normal outbursts. For almost all maxima, stars of this type rise to near maximum brightness in 24 hours or less. Some have a short pause at an intermediate magnitude on the rise for an hour or two. They also have periodic oscillations (superhumps), with amplitudes of mag. 0.2 to 0.5, superimposed on the light-curve. Their period is about 3% longer than the orbital period. Z CAMELOPARDALIS STARS (UGZ) make up the third subtype of dwarf nova. They differ from other types in occasionally remaining at an intermediate magnitude between maximum and minimum for several cycles. These ‘standstills’ occur at unpredictable intervals. Z Camelopardalis stars may sometimes take several days to r ise to maximum. Their mean cycles are shorter than those of the other two subtypes, ranging from ten to 40 days. dwarf star Star lying on the MAIN SEQUENCE . The term ‘dwarf ’ is derived from the early history of the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM , when stars were divided into the main-sequence ‘dwarfs’ and the more luminous ‘giants’. The term ‘main-sequence star’ is more usually used today, except for stars of mass lower than about 0.8 solar mass, which are called RED DWARFS . Stellar-like bod- ies below 0.08 solar mass are called BROWN DWARFS . Main- sequence stars are distinct from WHITE DWARFS and BLACK DW ARFS , which are evolved stars in the final stages of their lives.

The angular diame- ter of the orbit of the stars around each other is observed, together with their apparent brightness, and by applying KEPLER ’ SLAWS and the MASS – LUMINOSITY RELATION , the distance to the binary star can be determined. dynamical time System of time used since 1984 as the va r iable in gravitational equations of motion used for com- puting the predicted positions, or EPHEMERIDES , of the Sun, Moon and planets. Terrestrial dynamical time (TDT), an a tomic timescale based on the SI second, is a continuation of EPHEMERIS TIME , the system previously used in calcula- tions of geocentric ephemerides. Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB) is used in equations of motion of planetary bodies relative to the BARYCENTRE of the Solar System. dynamics Branch of mechanics devoted to the study of forces, accelerations and the resulting motions of bodies. NEWTON ’ SL AW SO FM O TION are the basis of dynamics, and the application of these together with NEWTON ’ SLAW OF GRAVITY results in KEPLER ’ SLAWS of planetary motion. A body undergoing circular motion with a radius, r , and at a velocity, v , will be accelerated towards the centre of the circle by an amount given by v 2 /r . It therefore experiences a force, F c , called the CEN - TRIPETAL FORCE , which is perpendicular to its velocity and is given by where m is the mass of the body. F or an elliptical orbit, the centripetal force will vary as the distance from the BARYCENTRE changes, and the force will no longer always be perpendicular to the velocity, but the orbital motion is still governed by Newton’s laws. dynamo effect Generation of a planet’s magnetic field by electromagnetic induction arising from convective motions in the electrically conducting core of the planet. The power sources must be sufficient to overcome the natural decay of electric currents in a conductor of finite conductivity (that is, the magnetic Reynolds number must exceed a critical value). The motions must have an asymmetry (just as the field coil in a self-exciting dynamo is wound in one sense), and this is attributed to the CORI - OLIS FORCE arising from the planet’s rotation. Cores in the terrestrial planets are iron-rich and thus electrically conducting; in Jupiter and Saturn they may be formed of metallic hydrogen, whereas for Uranus there may be a conducting electrolyte at its centre. The fields produced are strongly dipolar and roughly aligned along the rota- tional axes of the planets, except for Uranus. Reversals of the polarity of the magnetic field appear to be an inherent property of the core dynamo. Dyson, Frank Watson (1868–1939) English astronomer, the ninth ASTRONOMER ROYAL (1910–33).

Its mean distance from the Sun is defined as one ASTRONOMICAL UNIT , a convenient standard for the description of distances within the Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun defines the plane of the ECLIPTIC , to which the orbits of the other planets, minor planets and comets in the Solar System are referred. The intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator at which the Sun appears to move from south to north defines the FIRST POINT OF ARIES , the zero point for the determination of RIGHT ASCENSION . The Earth has one natural satellite, the MOON , which is believed to have formed by A CCRETION in orbit of material ejected following the impact of a Mars-sized body with the proto-Earth. As a planet, Earth is distinguished by its abundant water, nitrogen–oxygen A TMOSPHERE , and its persistent and general geological activity, including con- tinuing and widespread plate TECTONICS . SEISMOLOGY has revealed the Earth’s internal structure, with a solid inner CORE , radius 1390 km (860 mi), which is believed to consist primarily of nickel and iron but prob- ably containing additional elements such as oxygen or sul- phur. This solid inner core is surrounded by a liquid outer core of similar material, with an external radius of 3480 km (2160 mi). The bulk of the planet lies in the MANTLE , which consists of iron- and magnesium-rich sili- cate materials in a semi-plastic state. Above the mantle is found the rigid LITHOSPHERE , which has two components, the outermost of which is a low-density CRUST . The crust consists of granitic continental rocks, extending to a depth of approximately 50 km (30 mi), and basaltic oceanic rocks, which are only 5–10 km (3–6 mi) in thickness. Denser lithospheric material underlies both continents and oceans to depths of approximately 100–200 km (60–120 mi) and 60 km (40 mi), respectively. The upper- most layer of the mantle, immediately below the lithos- phere, has a much lower viscosity than the rest of the mantle, and is known as the ASTHENOSPHERE . At the Earth’s centre, the pressure is estimated to be approximately 4000 kbar and the temperature to lie within the range 5500–7500 K. (The uncertainty arises from dif- ficulties in determining what elements may be present apart from iron and nickel.) The temperature of the liquid outer core is 4000–5000 K. This internal heat comprises residual heat from the original planetary accretion process together with heat produced by the radioactive decay of isotopes of elements such as uranium, rubidium and thori- um. Radioisotope dating techniques suggest that the age of the Earth is approximately 4.5 \u0003 10 9 y ears, slightly greater than the oldest dates established for lunar rocks (4.44 \u0003 10 9 y ears). Because of Earth’s level of geological activity, the greatest ages yet discovered are 4.276 \u0003 10 9 y ears for zircon crystals from Australia, and 3.96 \u0003 10 9 y ears for the Acasta gneiss from Canada. All these ages are exceeded by those found for some components of certain METEORITES , which predate the formation of the Solar System. The solid inner core rotates slightly faster (by c .0.66 second) than the rest of the planet, and it is this, together with motions in the liquid core, that generates the Earth’s moderately strong magnetic field. The field is in the form of a magnetic dipole, the axis of which is inclined by c .11º.5 to the planet’s rotational axis. It has a field strength at t he surface of c .0.3 gauss at the equator and approxi- mately double this value at the magnetic poles. The mag- netic field defines the Earth’s MAGNETOSPHERE , and its interaction with the SOLAR WIND forms RADIATION BELTS (the VA N ALLEN BELTS ) around the planet. The study of the palaeomagnetism fossilized in the crustal rocks indi- cates that the positions of the magnetic poles have migrat- ed over geological time relative to the positions of the continents, and that there have been relatively regular reversals in the polarity of the field. Both of these effects, taken in conjunction with radioisotope dating, were instrumental in gaining acceptance of the theory of plate tectonics. The concept of continental drift was originally mooted by the Austrian meteorologist Alfred Wegener (1880–1930), who first lectured on the subject in 1912, b ut it did not gain widespread approval. The imprint of magnetic reversals in the basaltic rocks of the ocean floor allowed geophysicists to assess the rate and pattern of seafloor spreading, establishing that no part of the ocean floor was more than 200,000 years old, thus confirming the reality of plate motion.

These rigid plates move over the more fluid asthenosphere. Plate boundaries are of three kinds: divergent, where adjacent plates are moving away from one another; convergent, where they are colliding; and conservative, where adjacent slabs are sliding past one another. The boundaries between plates are marked by dynamic activities, such as seismic disturbances, volcan- ism, major faulting and, over long periods of time, by the creation of new mountain ranges. New oceanic crust is created at divergent boundaries or spreading centres, which are located at oceanic ridges and broader rises, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East P acific Rise. Hot basaltic magma rising from the Earth’s mantle accretes on the edges of the diverging plates, which move laterally, creating new seafloor at rates that vary between 0.5 and 10 cm per year. The creation of new oceanic crust is largely balanced by destruction at a type of convergent boundary known as a subduction zone. A subduction zone is a steeply inclined belt where oceanic crust plunges beneath the adjacent plate, which may be of either continental or oceanic type. Complex processes occur at subduction zones; the subducting slab carries with it some of the overlying sedi- ments and both are eventually melted at depth. Some of the sedimentary veneer is scraped off the plunging slab, and it accretes as highly deformed rocks on the edge of the ov erlying plate. Magma, generated by frictional heat and the increasing temperatures with depth, is less dense than the overlying rocks and penetrates the upper plate. At the edge of a continental plate this volcanic activity gives rise to major mountain ranges such as the cordilleran chains of North, Central and South America. When the overriding slab is of generally oceanic type, volcanically active island- arcs are produced, as in the Aleutian islands, Japan, Indonesia and New Zealand. Subduction zones are nor- mally marked by deep oceanic trenches, and they are the sites of major earthquake activity, including deep-focus earthquakes occurring at depths as great at 700 km (430 mi). The majority of volcanic and earthquake activi- ty on Earth occurs around the destructive margins of the ‘Ring of Fire’, which girdles the Pacific Ocean. Major mountain-building also occurs where two continental plates converge. The Himalayas and the high plateau of Tibet were raised by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. They form part of the other major belt of v olcanic and earthquake activity, which runs west through Central Asia and the Mediterranean. Improved seismographic techniques and analysis in recent years have provided considerable information about structures within the mantle. Cold subducting slabs may descend as far as the core–mantle boundary, where r ising superplumes of hot mantle material originate. A continental plate that moves over a former subduction zone may be dragged vertically downwards by as much as 200–300 m (650–1000 ft). A continental plate above a superplume may be raised by a similar amount, as is occurring at present under southern Africa. Superplumes are also thought to be responsible for generating major and prolonged volcanic activity, such as that exhibited by the Deccan traps, the Siberian volcanic province and the Columbia River flood basalts. The Earth’s climate is determined by a number of fac- tors. The overall pattern is set by the differing intensities of insolation at different latitudes. The resulting tempera- ture differences set up pressure gradients, which in turn generate the complex atmospheric circulation. The latter is a principal factor in the oceanic circulation, although temperature and salinity gradients are also involved. Because the oceans act as a heat reservoir, they exert a g reat influence over decade-long changes in weather and climate. Over the course of geological time there have been significant changes in the Earth’s climate, most notably shown by recurrent periods of major glaciation, or ice ages, as well as periods of widespread warmth. Plate tectonics has played a major part in initiating some of these climatic changes, because of its effects upon the oceanic circulation and the distribution of land masses at high or low latitudes. The immediate cause, however, appears to have been fluctuations (as well as secular change) in the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere, with astronomical factors (such as variations in the eccentricity of the Earth’s orbit, changes in inclination to the ecliptic, Earth-crossing asteroid 122 E \u0001 Earth En route to the Moon in 1972 December, the Apollo 17 crew obtained this photograph of an almost full Earth.

The effect is best observed either just before or soon after new moon, when the faintly illuminated unlit area can be seen nestling in the thin, brightly lit crescent, a phenomenon popularly described as ‘the old moon in the new moon’s arms’. As the illuminated portion of the lunar disk increases in size the earthshine becomes too faint in comparison to be detected. At the same time, the phase of the Earth, as seen from the Moon, is shifting from full to gibbous, meaning that less light is reflected from it. eccentric P oint introduced by Ptolemy to improve the description of planetary orbits. It is the centre of the deferent circle, but is near the Earth, not coincident with the Earth as in earlier geocentric systems ( see PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM ). eccentricity (symbol e ) One of the ORBITAL ELEMENTS ; it describes the degree of ELONGATION of an elliptical orbit. The eccentricity is obtained by dividing the distance between the foci of the ELLIPSE by the length of the major axis. A circular orbit has e = 0; a parabolic orbit is the extreme case of an ellipse, with e = 1. echelle grating High-dispersion DIFFRACTION GRATING that produces spectra with a high degree of resolution ov er a narrow band of wavelengths. Like a standard dif- fraction grating, an echelle grating uses a number of par- allel grooves ruled on its surface to disperse light into a SPECTRUM . The difference with an echelle grating is that these grooves are stepped and their spacing relatively wide. Light is directed on to the grating at a large angle, producing a number of high-resolution overlapping spec- tra. These are then separated by a second, lower disper- sion grating or a prism. Echelle gratings are used in echelle SPECTROGRAPHS . eclipse P assage of one body through the shadow cast by another. A LUNAR ECLIPSE , where the Moon passes through Earth’s shadow, is a good example. The Galilean satellites undergo eclipses in Jupiter’s shadow: at certain times, twice in a jovian year, the orbits of the satellites align with the Sun such that one may eclipse another. Strictly speaking, a SOLAR ECLIPSE is an OCCULTATION , and the Moon’s shadow covers only a relatively small part of the Earth’s surface. eclipse year Interval of 346.62 days, which is the time between successive passages of the Sun through a node of the Moon’s orbit. Eclipses can only occur when the Sun and Moon are aligned at the node. The eclipse year is shorter than the sidereal year of 365.25 days because the nodes move westwards (regress) by about 19º per year. A SAROS contains 19 eclipse years. eclipsing binary Subset of the CLOSE BINARY star systems – BINARY STARS whose separation is usually of the order of ten times, or less, the average size of the components. The likelihood of observing eclipses in binary systems is greatest when the mean separation of components is just a few times greater than the mean radius of the stars themselves. The component stars of most classical eclipsing pairs have similar radii. The light from a system in which one star is very much larger than the other would tend to come predominantly from that large star, so that the eclipse of the small star ( OCCULTATION ), or its passage in front of the large star ( TRANSIT ), would tend to have an effect too small to be readily observed, unless that small star were relatively very bright (per unit surface area) compared to the large star. Eclipsing binaries undergo a regular cycle of variation in apparent brightness because their orbital motions take place in a plane that is oriented at a relatively low angle to the line of sight. For eclipsing binaries, the INCLINATION is usually not far from 90°, and, in any case, greater than about 58°. There will be a succession of two alternating photometric minima – one a transit, the other an occulta- tion (unless the stars are exactly equal in size). Eclipses may be total, partial or annular. Because there are two stars in the system, two eclipses may be expected during the course of an orbital cycle, though it sometimes happens that one of these events caus- es so slight a loss of overall light from the system as not to be noticeable. The deeper eclipse minimum, associated with the eclipse of the brighter star, is usually called the primary minimum. The star so eclipsed would tend to be called the primary star, and, in practice, this star is very often the more massive. The shallower secondary minimum is asso- ciated with the eclipse of the secondary component. The components of most eclipsing binary systems revolve in orbits that are essentially circular. Elementary geometry will then show that the same effective area of stellar surface is eclipsed at both minima, and the minima are also of equal overall duration (for circular orbits). Since the eclipsed areas are equal at corresponding phases of either minimum, the ratio of depths in the minima at these phases is proportional to the brightness per unit area. The primary star is thus the star of greater surface temperature; though it is possible for the secondary, though cooler, to be bigger in size (the primary minimum w ould then be of occultation type), and actually to emit more light overall than the primary. This situation may be confusing when SPECTROSCOPY is being combined with PHOTOMETRY , in which case the spectroscopic primary (source of greater fraction of overall light) would then dif- fer from the photometric primary (the hotter star). Eclipsing binary systems attract attention because their light-curves can be analysed to determine key parameters of great astrophysical significance. From such systems, information on the sizes, luminosities, surface tempera- tures, masses, and, to some extent, composition and structure of the component stars may be derived. Such absolute parameters are not derived from a single mono- chromatic light-curve (though surface temperatures may be inferred from two such curves at different wave- lengths), but if spectroscopic evidence is available on the system (such as the spectral type and spectral luminosity class of the brighter, or perhaps both components), then 123 E \u0001 eclipsing binary The light- curve (bottom) of an Algol-type binary can be accounted for by partial eclipses of each star by the other (top). At the deep primary minimum, the brighter, smaller star is largely covered by the fainter. When both stars are fully visible, light is at a maximum, while a less prominent secondary minimum occurs midway through the cycle as the brighter star passes in front of the fainter. time (hours) apparent magnitude 01020 30 40 50 60 70 80 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8 3.0 3.2 3.4 3.6 AA B E AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 11:08 am Page 123"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"absolute values can be inferred. More powerful arguments are available when the radial velocity variations of one or both stars throughout the course of the orbit are known. As the use of the word ‘eclipsing’ suggests, however, it is the photometric evidence that tends to take precedence in the study of this class of object. Eclipsing binaries are classified into three basic types on the basis of their light- curves. Historically, these were described as the ALGOL type (EA), the BETA LYRAE type (EB), and the W URSAE MAJORIS type (EW). EA types have an essentially constant (to within 0.1 mag.) light level outside of eclipses, which are thus clearly defined (at least for the primary eclipse). EB-type light-curves show a continuous pattern of vari- ability. The abrupt variations that mark out the eclipse regions are still distinct, but proximity effects render the regions outside the minima (sometimes called ‘shoulders’) markedly curved. EW systems show more or less equal depths of primary and secondary minima. In EW light- curves proximity effects show such a scale of variation as to merge smoothly into the eclipse minima, which can no longer be clearly discerned. The proximity effects are explained in terms of two basic types of interaction – the reflection effect and gravitational interactions. Both effects increase with reduced separation of the components. As well as classification based on light-curve morpholo- gy, schemes have been proposed that are influenced by the physics or evolution of the stellar components. A common scheme classifies eclipsing binaries into detached, semide- tached and CONTACT BINARY systems, based on the rela- tionship of the member stars to the R OCHE LOBE . If a binary component were to expand beyond this limiting surface, a dynamical instability of some kind would ensue. The detached systems are generally seen as unevolved, each star lying fully within its own Roche lobe. Probably the most frequently observed type is the semidetached kind, of which Algol may be regarded as typical. In these systems the secondary is very close to or in ‘contact’ with its surrounding Roche lobe. Physical Algol-type close binary systems do not always correspond with the EA- type light-curves: the physical Algols show light-curves that are actually a subset of the EA kind. The contact binaries are characterized by both stars filling their Roche lobes; they would thus be in contact with each other. It is now thought that these binaries, which, as a class, coincide closely with systems showing the EW-type light-curve, ov erflow beyond their common (inner) Roche limiting v olume into a surrounding common envelope. In addition to these major groupings, there are various smaller subgroups. Some DW ARF NOVA systems exhibit eclipses, and the special geometrical circumstance may be particularly revealing on physical properties. In a more extreme physical condition are the X - RAY BINARIES ; the eclipse effect may sometimes affect the X-ray radiation itself, thus providing insight into the geometrical arrange- ment of the components. Though there is no definitely established case of an eclipsing binary member of a globular cluster, eclipsing systems have been observed in the MAGELLANIC CLOUDS . In principle, they offer the means of comparing stellar properties, in a direct way, over very large reaches of space. About 6000 eclipsing binary systems are known, including many that also exhibit other forms of variability. ecliptic Apparent yearly path of the Sun against the background stars. Caused by the Earth’s orbital motion, the ecliptic is really a projection of the Earth’s orbital plane on to the CELESTIAL SPHERE and, because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis, is inclined to the CELESTIAL EQUATOR at an angle of approximately 23º.5, which is known as the OBLIQUITY OF ECLIPTIC . The celestial equator intersects the ecliptic at two points on the celestial sphere, the FIRST POINT OF ARIES and the FIRST POINT OF LIBRA , also sometimes referred to as the EQUINOXES . The ecliptic poles lie 90º from the ecliptic, in the constellations of DRACO and DORADO . The annual path of the Sun takes it through the famil- iar 12 constellations of the zodiac, but the effects of PRE - CESSION , together with re-definitions of constellation boundaries, mean that the ecliptic now also passes through the constellation of OPHIUCHUS . The apparent paths of the planets also closely follow the ecliptic since the planes of their orbits are only slightly inclined to that of the Earth. The name ‘ecliptic’ derives from the fact that eclipses of the Sun or Moon can only take place when the Moon passes through this plane. ecliptic coordinates System of locating points or celes- tial objects on the CELESTIAL SPHERE using the ECLIPTIC as the plane of reference and the measures of CELESTIAL LATITUDE and CELESTIAL LONGITUDE (also known as ecliptic latitude and ecliptic longitude). Celestial latitude is measured in degrees from the ecliptic (0º) in a positive direction to the north ecliptic pole ( \u0001 90º) and a negative direction to the south ecliptic pole ( \u0002 90º). Celestial longi- tude is measured around the ecliptic from 0º to 360º, east- w ards of the FIRST POINT OF ARIES , the intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator. ecliptic limits Greatest angular distance around the ECLIPTIC that the new moon or the full moon can be from the Moon’s nodes for an ECLIPSE to take place. The limits are 18º.5 for the new moon at a SOLAR ECLIPSE , and 12º.2 for the full moon at a LUNAR ECLIPSE . E corona Extended form of the solar CORONA . It is produced by interactions of ions with electrons and protons, and radiation from the PHOTOSPHERE , which result in production of EMISSION LINES . The E (emission line) corona is present in the visible part of the spectrum, where about 20 emission lines are present, and also at short, ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths. ecosphere Spherical region around a star, also known as the circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ), within which life can exist. Its inner and outer limits may be set at those distances from the star at which the effective energy flux is respectively ~1.2 and ~0.4 times the present value of the solar flux at Earth’s orbit (1360 W/m 2 ). This range is determined by the tolerance of known forms of terrestrial life and the extremes of the Earth’s surface BIOSPHERE ; it applies only to a planetary body of suitable mass and chemical composition (similar to the Earth’s) that orbits entirely within the ecosphere. F or some subsurface micro-organisms ( see LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE ), the limiting radii of the Solar System ecosphere extends from ~0.4 to ~40 AU, a zone almost 75 times wider than the ecosphere. In general, the limiting radii of the ecosphere for a plan- etary system depend on the luminosity and surface tem- perature of the primary star. For the Sun, a main-sequence G-type dwarf, the present ecosphere extends from just inside the Earth’s orbit to just within the orbit of Mars. The width and distance of the ecosphere changes over time with the evolution of the star. The lumi- nosity of the Sun is steadily increasing, and the limits of the ecosphere are migrating outwards. A star more mas- sive and hotter than the Sun will have a larger and wider ecosphere, while a less massive and cooler star will have a smaller and narrower one. Eddington, Arthur Stanley (1881–1944) English astrophysicist known for his advocacy of Einstein’s general theory of relativity and his discovery of the MASS – LUMINOSITY RELATION . In 1905 he joined the RO YA L GREENWICH OBSERVATORY , where he successfully reduced photographic observations of the asteroid Eros to obtain a more precise calculation of the SOLAR P ARALLAX . Eddington used statistical methods to discover the distribution of stars in the Milky Way and their motions. In 1913 Cambridge University named him Plumian Professor of Astronomy, and the next year he w as appointed director of Cambridge Observatory. Eddington soon became interested in Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY and its prediction that light rays ecliptic 124 E E AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 11:08 am Page 124"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"Egyptian astronomy w ould be deflected in a gravitational field. The best test of this theory was to observe a total eclipse of the Sun, the nearest body possessing a massive gravitational field. If the positions of stars that appeared very close to the Sun’s limb during an eclipse were altered slightly from their ‘normal’ positions as observed when the Sun was nowhere in their vicinity, this would prove Einstein’s theory. For the 1919 total solar eclipse, Eddington organized an expedi- tion to the West African island of Principe and obtained several photographic plates of stars near the solar limb. Back in England, he announced that careful measurement and reduction of these stars’ positions confirmed the pre- dicted bending of sunlight. Eddington’s greatest contributions were to the theory of energy production in stellar interiors and stellar evolu- tion, summarized in his classic book The Internal Constitu- tion of the Stars (1926). He discovered (1924) that for MAIN - SEQUENCE stars there exists a linear relationship between their absolute bolometric magnitudes (a function of the logarithm of the star’s luminosity) and the loga- r ithms of their masses. Eddington correctly modelled the abundance of hydrogen in solar-type stars, and evolved a theory to explain how CEPHEID VARIABLE stars pulsate. Eddington limit Upper limit to the ratio of luminosity to mass that a star can have before RADIATION PRESSURE ov ercomes the GRAVITATIONAL FORCE . It was proposed by Sir Arthur Eddington. Early estimates gave a theoretical limit to the mass of stars of around 60 solar masses, while modern estimates give a limit as high as 440 solar masses. See also STELLAR MASS Edgeworth–Kuiper belt (outer asteroid belt) Broadly planar zone, stretching from the orbit of Neptune at 30 AU out to about 1000 AU, populated by a substantial complex of planetesimals currently classed as ASTEROIDS . The existence of this band was proposed on theoretical grounds by Kenneth Edgeworth (1880–1972) in 1949 and independently by Gerard KUIPER in 1951. The basis of their idea was that a vast number of COMETS or planetesimals must have formed in the outer Solar System from the SOLAR NEBULA and that they should persist beyond Neptune, never having accreted to produce a fully fledged planet. The concept w as resurrected in the 1980s as an explanation of the origin of SHORT - PERIOD COMETS : such a belt could explain the generally low orbital inclinations of such comets, whereas the spherical OORT CLOUD model could not. Recently it has been realized that in the 1930s Frederick Leonard (1896–1960) had put forward similar ideas to those of Edgeworth and Kuiper. The first member of the belt was discovered in 1992. Through to late 2001 more than 500 objects had been found in this region. Their sizes are mostly in the range of 100 to 500 km (60 to 300 mi), although larger bodies exist, for example VA R UNA . There is no reason to believe that there are not also many smaller members of this belt. Members of the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt are often called TRANS - NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS (TNOs). Many of them have been found to occupy the 2:3 RESONANCE against the orbital period of Neptune, as does Pluto, and these are collectively termed PLUTINOS ; other resonant orbits also exist. Other TNOs, following semi-random orbits, are often termed CUBEWANOS . Although categorized as asteroids in terms of their nam- ing and cataloguing, members of the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt are thought to be similar to comets in terms of their physical nature. Their spectral reflectivities show them to be reddish, continuing the trend seen from the inner bor- der of the MAIN BELT of asteroids through to its outer edge, and then through the region of the giant planets. Edge- wo r th–Kuiper belt objects do not show comet-like activity because they are at such huge distances from the Sun. If they leak inwards into planet-crossing orbits they may become CENTAURS , in which case cometary outgassing can begin to occur, as observed in the case of CHIRON . It is thought likely that Neptune’s moon TRITON and many of the small outer satellites of the giant planets may have begun their lives in this belt. effective focal length W orking focal length of an optical system that uses several elements to bring light to a focus; the quantity comes into play when, for example, eyepieces are used to increase the IMAGE SCALE of an instrument. effective temperature Te mperature of an object found by assuming that its total emission over all wavelengths is that of a BLACK BODY . The temperature is obtained using the STEFAN – BOLTZMANN LAW . It is similar to the RADIA - TION TEMPERATURE , except that the latter uses the emis- sion from the object at a particular wavelength, or over a small wavelength region, and hence the Planck equation ( see PLANCK DISTRIBUTION ).

The Egg Nebula may be less than 500 years old. Images from the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE show mul- tiple arcs of material in shells surrounding the central star, indicating that mass ejection during planetary nebula for- mation is episodic. The Egg Nebula lies at a distance of 3000 l.y. Egyptian astronomy Astronomy as practised by the ancient Egyptians, until the time of the Persian conquests in the first millennium BC . Although there are historical records dating back to around 3000 BC , there is no evidence that the Egyptians attained the technical level of BABYLONIAN ASTRONOMY . With a less developed geometry and number system, their knowledge of celestial motions was inferior. They did, however, possess a complex pantheon of deities that was closely linked to their constellations and creation myths, and solar rituals. As in other ancient cultures, the main reason for mak- ing astronomical observations was to keep track of the passing of the year and the hours of day and night. Their agriculture depended on the annual flooding of the Nile, which deposited a layer of silt that fertilized the land. This annual event of vital importance had to be predict- ed, but the original Egyptian calendar was based on a fixed number of lunar months, and soon became out of step with the solar year. The calendar was reconciled with the true solar year by observing the heliacal rising of Sirius (then called Sothis), which heralded the flooding of the Nile. If a heliacal rising occurred in the 12th month, an extra, intercalary month was added, the first time in history that such a step was taken. By perhaps as early as 3000 BC , the year had been stan- dardized to 365 days, and 12 months of 30 days were each divided into three weeks of 10 days. With each week was associated one of 36 small constellations whose heliacal r isings were separated by about 10 days. During the course of an average night (excluding twilight periods), 12 of these constellations were observed to rise, leading to the division of the night into 12 hours. Daytime was likewise divided into 12 hours, and thus arose the 24-hour clock. 125 E \u0001 Edgeworth–Kuiper belt A pair of Hubble Space Telescope images showing a faint, distant comet nucleus (circled) a few kilometres in diameter in the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt beyond the orbit of Neptune.

That the Egyptians were accomplished observers and surveyors is evident from the construction of pyramids and temples, some of which are aligned north–south to an accuracy of a few arcminutes. Several of the pyramids, including the Great Pyramid at Gizeh, have long, narrow shafts angled to the horizontal, which have been conjec- tured to align on certain stars at their culmination. Einstein, Albert (1879–1955) German-American theoretical physicist who gained worldwide fame for his theories of SPECIAL RELATIVITY and GENERAL RELATIVITY linking matter, space and time, which had a profound effect on COSMOLOGY . At school and college, he showed no special aptitude; Hermann MINKOWSKI , one of his professors at the Technische Hochschule at Zürich, later expressed his astonishment that such an ordinary student had become a genius. Einstein became a Swiss citizen in 1901 and, while working at the Patent Office in Bern, explained the photoelectric effect by using Max PLANCK ’s radiation law to describe light in terms of ‘quanta’, discrete b undles of energy, later called PHOTONS . For this work, Einstein was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize for Physics. In 1905 Einstein introduced his theory of special relativ- ity, which held that the velocity of light in a vacuum is con- stant and that the laws of physics must remain the same in all inertial reference frames. The special theory described space and time as inseparable entities (which he called SPACETIME ), predicting the phenomena of time dilation for bodies moving at velocities near that of light and the Lorentz contraction, whereby such an object will appear foreshortened in the direction of its relativistic motion. From the special theory, Einstein derived his famous for- mula E = mc 2 to describe the relation between energy and relativistic mass. By 1909 he was gaining recognition as a leading theoretical physicist, and he became a professor of physics at the University of Zürich. His fame in the inter- national scientific community spread, and in 1914 he was appointed director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, Berlin. Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY , first pub- lished in 1915, introduced the gravitational EQUIVALENCE PRINCIPLE – that gravitational fields and uniform accelera- tion were equivalent. This concept, which defined gravita- tional fields as the warping of SPACETIME by massive objects, predicted that a massive body like the Sun would produce a gravity field capable of slightly deflecting the paths of light from stars near the solar limb. The best way of testing this prediction was to observe such stars during a total solar eclipse, and in 1919, eclipse expeditions led by Arthur EDDINGTON and others confirmed this effect. The effects of the curvature of space are most evident for the LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE of the Universe, which led Einstein to apply general relativity to cosmology; he devel- oped a model of a finite but unbounded universe, intro- ducing the concept of a COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT . From this time onwards, his main scientific interest was an unsuccessful quest for a unified field theory linking gravi- tation and electromagnetism. Relativity made Einstein world-famous, a media star like no other scientist before or since, his face a 20th-cen- tury icon. As a Jew, Einstein found conditions in Germany intolerable after Hitler’s accession in 1933, and he remained in the USA, where he had been visiting Caltech. He became the first professor at Princeton University’s Institute for Advanced Study, where he remained for the rest of his life, taking US citizenship in 1940. Einstein Observatory Name given after its launch in 1978 November to NASA’s second High Energy Astronomical Observatory satellite. Its payload comprised four nested grazing incidence X - RAY TELESCOPES with a maximum diameter of 0.6 m (2 ft) and focal length 3.4 m (11 ft) With an angular resolution of 4 \u0001 , this satellite revolu- tionized X - RAY ASTRONOMY . Operational for two and a half years, it detected thousands of new X-ray sources. Its observations confirmed that almost all types of stars emit X-rays. Knowledge of the X-ray properties of QU ASARS w as greatly enhanced by the Einstein Observatory, while its observations of numerous GALACTIC CLUSTERS trans- formed our view of these extended X-ray sources. Einstein ring Distorted image of a distant light source, seen around a GRAVITATIONAL LENS . Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY predicted that rays of light should bend in a gravitational field, thus allowing nearby objects to focus the light of more distant objects. In the special case where the source is directly behind the lensing object, its light is spread out into a ring. In practice, perfect rings are rare, though incomplete rings – arcs – are commonly seen through GALAXY CLUSTERS . Einstein shift REDSHIFT (increase in wavelength) of spectral lines in radiation emitted from within a strong gr a vitational field. See GRAVITATIONAL REDSHIFT ejecta Material, such as ash, lapilli and bombs, that is violently thrown out during the eruption of a volcano. Also the impact debris and sometimes impact melt that is ejected in the process of impact CRATER formation. Vol- canic ash may be distributed by atmospheric currents up to hundreds or thousands of kilometres from the source. Lapilli and bombs fall in the neighbourhood of the erup- tion vent. Excavated material forms a concentric ejecta blanket around an impact crater, typically composed of the crushed target rocks with a minor admixture of impactor material. Impact-melted target material is signif- icant in the ejecta from large impact craters. On Mars, ejecta from many impact craters show morphologic evi- dence of flow after they landed on the surface; they are known as fluidized ejecta. This flow is caused by the pres- ence in the target of ice and water, which lubricate the ejecta and enable it to flow like a mud. On Venus many craters show the presence of ejecta outflows. These radar- bright flows originate within blocky and hummocky ejecta blankets. Ejecta outflows are believed to be flows of super- heated impact melt and/or the fine-grained fraction of ejecta debris suspended in Venus’ dense atmosphere. Elara One of the small satellites in JUPITER ’s intermediate g roup, discovered by Charles Perrine (1867–1951) in 1905. Elara is about 76 km (47 mi) in size. It takes 259.6 days to circuit the planet, at an average distance of 11.74 million km (7.30 million mi) from its centre. It has a substantial inclination (near 27º) and moderate eccentricity (0.217). Although Elara has the same orbital period as LY SITHEA , their differing orbital characteristics mean they are not usually regarded as being CO - ORBITING SATELLITES in the same way as are other closer, dynamically well behaved, satellites of the giant planets. It seems likely that this pair originated through the break-up of a larger captured body that also spawned LEDA and HIMALIA . E-layer One of the distinct layers within the Earth’s IONOSPHERE where the density of free electrons is higher than average. It is more correctly described as a region, because it lies between 90 and 150 km (about 60–90 mi) above the Earth’s surface. It is present during the daytime, but RECOMBINATION occurs at night and the layer weakens or disappears. Radio waves of sufficiently low frequency are reflected by the E-layer. Sometimes, a poorly understood phenomenon known as Sporadic-E occurs, principally in the months of May to August for the northern hemisphere. This effect causes VHF radio wa v es with frequencies up to 200 MHz to be reflected. electromagnetic radiation (e-m radiation) RADIATION consisting of periodically varying electric and magnetic fields that vibrate perpendicularly to each other and travel through space at the speed of light.

He identified light as a form of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave motion, vibrating perpendicularly to the direction of propagation, like the wave in a guitar string. The dis- tance between successive wave crests is the wavelength, and wavelengths range from less than 10 \u0001 14 m (for the shortest gamma rays) to kilometres or more (for the longest radio waves). The number of wave crests per second passing a fixed point is the frequency. The rela- tionship between wavelength ( \u0002 ), frequency ( f or v ) and the speed of light ( c ) is \u0002 f = c . High frequency corresponds to short wavelength and low frequency to long wavelength. The unit of frequency is the hertz (Hz), where 1 Hz = 1 wave crest per second. Thus a wavelength of 1 m is equivalent to a frequency of 3 \u0003 10 8 Hz; a wavelength of 1 nm is equivalent to 3 \u0003 10 17 Hz, and so on. Electromagnetic radiation may be polarized. The state of POLARIZATION describes the orientations of the vibra- tions. An unpolarized beam consists of waves vibrating in all possible directions perpendicular to the direction of propagation, while a plane-polarized beam consists of wa v es vibrating in one plane only. In circularly polarized radiation the direction of the vibration rotates at the fre- quency of the radiation as the wave moves along, while in elliptically polarized radiation, the direction and the amplitude of the vibration change. Electromagnetic radiation may also be described as a stream of particles, called PHOTONS , each of which is a lit- tle packet, or ‘quantum’, of energy. The energy of a pho- ton, E , is related to wavelength and frequency by: E = hf = hc / \u0002 where h is PLANCK ’ S CONSTANT . Thus the shorter the wa v elength (or the higher the frequency), the greater is the energy of the photon. Gamma rays and X-rays have the highest energies while radio waves have the lowest energies. Light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation exhibit wave properties in some circumstances ( see REFRACTION , INTERFERENCE and DIFFRACTION ) and parti- cle properties in others, notably the photoelectric effect. Electromagnetic radiation is emitted or absorbed by many processes, and the ones that predominate vary according to the wavelength regions. Thermal radiation is produced at all wavelengths, but the peak of the emission depends upon the temperature ( see WIEN ’ SLAW ). As a rea- sonable generalization, for the radio region there is direct interaction with electric currents, FREE – FREE RADIATION and SYNCHROTRON RADIATION , in the microwave and infrared, the interaction is with rotating and vibrating mol- ecules, in the optical and ultraviolet it is with electrons in a toms and molecules, while at the shortest wavelengths the interaction is directly with nuclei. Almost all our knowledge of the Universe is obtained from electromagnetic radiation emitted from objects in space. The only exceptions are direct sampling of Solar System bodies, COSMIC RAYS , NEUTRINOS , and eventually perhaps GRAVITATIONAL WAVES .

The principal divisions (and their approximate wa v elength regions) are gamma rays (less than 0.01 nm), X-rays (0.01–10 nm), ultraviolet (10–400 nm), visible (400–700 nm), infrared (700 nm–1 mm), microwaves (1 mm–0.3 m) and radio waves (greater than 0.3 m). Further subdivisions that may be encountered include hard X-rays, soft X-rays, EXTREME - ULTRAVIOLET (EUV), NEAR - INFRARED , middle-infrared, FAR - INFRARED , submillimetre and millimetre wave. The Earth’s atmosphere prevents most wavelengths from penetrating to ground level. Gamma rays, X-rays and the great bulk of ultraviolet radiation are absorbed at alti- tudes of tens or even hundreds of kilometres, where they excite atoms and molecules, dissociate (break them apart) or ionize atoms or molecules (expel electrons from them). Radiation of between about 300 nm and 750 nm can penetrate readily to ground level and this range of wave- lengths is termed the ‘optical window’.

Electrons are the constituents of all atoms, moving around the central, far more massive, nucleus in a series of layers or electron shells. Electrons can also exist independently as free electrons. The electron has a mass of 9.1 \u0002 10 \u0003 31 kg and a negative charge of l.6 \u0002 10 \u0003 19 C. The antiparticle of the electron is called the positron.

It is defined as the energy gained by an electron when accelerat- ed by a voltage of 1 volt. 1 eV = 1.602 \u0002 10 \u0003 19 J. It is often a convenient unit for the energies of PHOTONS and sub- a tomic particles. Thus the visible spectrum ranges from photons with an energy of 1.8 eV (red) to 3.6 eV (violet). electroweak force Pa rt of the GRAND UNIFIED THEO - RY (GUT) of the FUNDAMENTAL FORCES . Elementary particle theory suggests that in the early universe when the temperature was near 10 15 K the electromagnetic force separated from the weak force and they became distinct independent forces. element Substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by chemical means. An element is composed solely of AT OMS with identical atomic numbers (that is, they all have the same number of protons within their nuclei), but it may contain a number of different ISO - T OPES . So far 107 elements have been identified, and 90 of the 92 so-called naturally occurring elements have been found in nature, either free, for example copper (Cu), iron (Fe), gold (Au) and sulphur (S), or combined with other elements, for example silicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) and calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). The missing two are tech- netium, identified in the cyclotron transmutation products of molybdenum in 1937, and promethium, isolated in 1945 from nuclear fission products. The remainder have been synthesized by nuclear bombardment or fission. The elements fall into three classes according to their physical properties: metals, non-metals and metalloids. Metals are the largest class and are physically distinguished as malleable, ductile, good conductors of heat and electric- ity, have a high lustre, a close-packed arrangement of a toms, and are usually strong. Non-metals are abundant in Earth’s crust and are important biologically. Generally they are poor conductors of heat and electricity, brittle, hard, lack lustre, and have very high melting points. This class though does also include the noble gases (helium, neon and so on). Elements included in the metalloids are boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and tellurium; they have both metallic and non-metallic properties. All elements have some isotopes that are radioactive. A radioactive element is one that has no stable isotopes. Such elements may exist in nature because they have very long HALF - LIVES , for example uranium-238, which has a half life 4.5 \u0002 10 9 y ears, or as decay products of longer- lived radioactive elements, for example radon, whose longest half-life is 3.8 days for radon-222. See also ASTRO - CHEMISTRY ; AT OMIC STRUCTURE element, orbital See ORBITAL ELEMENTS elementary particle Subatomic particles that are thought to be indivisible. Atoms that make up ordinary matter are not the smallest indivisible units of mass. Each a tom can be divided up into parts called electrons, pro- tons and neutrons. These smaller, more elementary parti- cles can be arranged to explain all known elements. It was eventually noticed that protons and neutrons were not truly elementary either, but were made up of still smaller particles called quarks. We now know that there are dozens of elementary particles, so many that particle physicists call it the ‘particle zoo’. The study of elemen- tary particle physics endeavours to classify and under- stand all of the known particles, including massless particles like photons. The table lists all of the families of elementary particles known. Some underlying theory must be able to explain the existence and interactions of all of the known elementary particles. The QU ANTUM THEORY w as devised to try to explain all of the known elementary particles and their interac- tions and fields. As work on the quantum theory pro- g ressed, more detailed treatments of the various particles and the discovery of new particles necessitated a revision of the standard quantum interpretation. The standard model linked the electromagnetic force with the strong force and explained many of the particles and their vari- ous interactions. Later theories like supersymmetry a ttempted to combine the standard model with the weak force to form a GRAND UNIFIED THEORY (GUT). A more sophisticated theory that would link the final force, grav- ity, to the three GUT forces is sometimes called the THE ORY OF EVERYTHING (TOE). ellipse One of a family of curves known as CONIC SECTIONS , with the significance for astronomy that the unperturbed orbits of the planets and satellites are ellipses around a primary body located at one of the foci of the ellipse. The other focus is empty. The longest line that can be drawn through the centre of the ellipse is the major axis; the shortest line is the minor axis. These two axes are perpendicular to each other. The two foci lie inside the ellipse on the major axis. The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is electron 128 E \u0001 ellipse The principal features of an ellipse are its two foci, its semimajor axis (a), its short (minor) axis and its eccentricity (e).

The eccentricity can range from 0 for the special case of a circle, where the two foci coincide at the centre of the circle, to almost 1, where the ellipse becomes very elongated, and the part close to either of the foci is virtually a P ARABOLA . See also ANOMALY ; ORBITAL ELEMENTS ellipsoid Three-dimensional ‘egg-shaped’ geometrical figure. Mathematically, it is defined as a closed surface whose cross-sections are ellipses or circles. An ellipsoid has three semi-axes: a semimajor axis ( a ), a semimean axis ( b ) and a semiminor axis ( c ), all at right angles to one another. Generally they will be of different lengths ( a \u0001 b \u0001 c ). If all are equal, the figure is a sphere. If b = c the figure is called a prolate spheroid. If a = b it is an oblate spheroid. An ELLIPTICAL GALAXY is an ellipsoid. A close satellite of a planet is distorted by rotational and tidal forces into a Roche ellipsoid, with the longest axis aligned towards the planet and the shortest in the direction of its orbital pole. A rapidly rotating self- gr a vitating body may be distorted into an equilibrium figure called a Jacobi ellipsoid. The properties of ellipsoids have been important in the study of the shape and evolution of elliptical galaxies. Ellipsoidal components are found in various optical systems. ellipsoidal variable (ELL) CLOSE BINARY star system, the components of which are almost in contact, but non- interacting, with the result that they are distorted to non- spherical shapes. Eclipses do not occur, because of the orbital inclination to the line of sight, but variations in the projected area of the stars produce variations in the ov erall magnitude. Periods are less than one day, with ranges in magnitude of less than 0.8. Such stars are of spectral type F to G. elliptical galaxy GALAXY that is elliptical in observed shape. Elliptical galaxies are generally composed of only old stars, with little dense gas available for additional star formation. Dynamical measurements show that many are triaxial, geometric figures with different radii along each axis, and thus their shapes reflect the distribution of stellar orbits rather than being produced by a net rotation. In the HUBBLE CLASSIFICATION , ellipticals are described according to apparent shape, from E0 for circular images to E7 for the most flattened ellipticals. Elliptical galaxies span a vast range in size and luminosity, from 100 million stars in a dwarf elliptical to 10 million million in the largest giant ellipticals. ellipticity (oblateness) Measure of the amount by which an ellipse deviates from a circle or by which a spheroid deviates from a perfect sphere. It is defined as the ratio of the difference between the major (longer) and minor (shorter) axes of an ellipse to the length of the major axis, or in the case of a sphere, the ratio of the difference between the equatorial and polar radii of a body to its equatorial radius. The ellipticity of a celestial body is an indicator of its speed of rotation because the faster it spins, the more it ‘bulges’ at the equator.

More accurately, the difference in the CELESTIAL LONGITUDE of the two bodies, measured in degrees. An elongation of 0º is called CONJUNCTION , one of 90º QU ADRATURE , and one of 180º OPPOSITION . For an INFERIOR PLANET , the maximum angular distance, east or w est, reached during each orbit is known as the GREATEST ELONGATION .

An emission line is caused by the radiation of photons of specific wavelength by some species of a tom, ion or molecule. Emission lines are produced when electrons associated with the various species jump to lower energy levels and thereby radiate their energy. See also EMISSION SPECTRUM emission nebula Generic term for any self-luminous interstellar gas cloud. The term embraces SUPERNOVA REMNANTS , PLANETARY NEBULAE and HII REGIONS . The emitted radiation is normally taken to be in and around the visible region, thus D ARK NEBULAE and REFLECTION NEBULAE are not included in the term even though they do emit microwave and radio radiation. The energy source for the nebulae varies from one type to another. In HII regions it is the ultraviolet radiation from hot young stars within the nebula. This radiation ionizes the atoms within the nebula and the subsequent RECOMBINATION of an ion and electron leads to emission of optical radiation.

A hot, low-density gas produces emission lines that may or may not be superimposed on a continuum.

Depending on temperatures and physical processes, they are seen in the range from gamma rays to radio waves. Emission spectra can be used to determine densities, temperatures, velocities and chemical compositions. Enceladus Small spherical SATELLITE of SATURN . It was discovered by William HERSCHEL in 1789. It is similar in size to its inner neighbour, MIMAS , but in other wa ys it could hardly be more different. Mimas has an old, heavily cratered surface, whereas Enceladus shows abundant signs of a prolonged active geological history. On images sent back by VOYA GER 2 in 1981, some apparently craterless (and therefore very young) regions are smooth, while other craterless tracts are traversed by sets of curved ridges, which may be cryovolcanic extrusions ( see CRYOVOLCANISM ). Elsewhere, the crater density varies greatly from one region to another, but even the most densely cratered areas have only about the same density of craters as the least cratered areas on Saturn’s other satellites. Parts of some old craters at terrain boundaries have been obliterated, probably by cryovolcanic resurfacing processes. Enceladus has clearly experienced several periods of activity, presumably powered by TIDAL HEATING . Enceladus is currently in a 2:1 orbital RESONANCE with the next-but-one satellite out, DIONE , and in a 1:2 orbital resonance with the small co-orbital satellites JANUS and EPIMETHEUS , the orbits of which lie within that of Mimas. Despite these orbital resonances, Enceladus probably experiences very little tidal heating today because the ECCENTRICITY of its orbit is currently too slight. However, its orbital eccentricity is likely to vary cyclically over tens or hundreds of millions of years, which could account for the multiple episodes of resur- facing that have left their traces on the surface of this remarkable satellite. Enceladus has a brighter surface than any other icy satellite, giving it an albedo of virtually 1. This brightness could be caused by cryovolcanic frost distributed across the globe by explosive eruptions. Alternatively, it could be a result of continual impacts on to the surface by particles from Saturn’s outermost ring (the E ring), within which the orbit of Enceladus lies. See data at SATURN Encke, Johann Franz (1791–1865) German astronomer, famous for calculating the orbit of the comet that bears his name. This comet had been observed in the 18th century by Pierre MÉCHAIN and Caroline HERSCHEL , and in 1805 and 1818 by Jean- Louis PONS . Pons suspected that his ‘two’ comets were actually the same object, and Encke’s improved orbital calculations confirmed this suspicion. He also discovered the ENCKE DIVISION in Saturn’s rings. Encke supervised the building of the new Berlin Observatory, which he directed from 1825 to 1865. Encke, Comet 2P/ Short-period comet, first discovered as a naked-eye object by Pierre MÉCHAIN in 1786. Comets discovered in 1795 by Caroline HERSCHEL , in 1805 by Jean Louis PONS , J.S. Huth and Alexis Bouvard (1767–1843), and in 1818 by Pons again were shown by Johann ENCKE in 1819 to be further returns of the same object. Encke’s Comet returned as predicted in 1822. To 1999 the comet has been observed at 58 returns, which is far more than any other comet. Its orbital period of 3.3 years is the shortest for any periodic comet. Small changes in the orbital period result from NON - GRAVITATIONAL FORCE produced by gas ejected from the comet’s nucleus. Modern detectors allow observation of 2P/Encke around its entire orbit. Encke Division Main division in Saturn’s A RING ; it was discovered by J.F. ENCKE . It is not a difficult feature to observe telescopically when the rings are suitably placed. The Encke Division’s mean distance from the centre of Saturn is 133,600 km (83,000 mi). As with the CASSINI DIVISION , it is not empty but represents a zone where ring particles are few. This and the other divisions are controlled by gravitational perturbations by the satellites. Endeavour Name of the fifth SPACE SHUTTLE orbiter; it replaced the Challenger lost in 1986. Endeavour first flew in 1992. Endymion Lunar crater (55ºN 55ºE), 117 km (73 mi) in diameter, with rim components reaching 4500 m (15,000 ft) above its floor. Because it is near the limb, foreshortening makes Endymion appear oblong, though it is actually round. The floor is smooth and dark, having been flooded by lava. This resurfacing has erased most of the inside details, though more recent impacts and ejecta are visible. Because of its age, Endymion has walls that are deeply incised by impact scars. energy Ability of a body to do work (that is, to induce changes to itself or to other bodies).

Potential energy includes: energy stored in a body that is within a gr a vitational field and is higher than its equilibrium posi- tion; the energy of an electron in an excited state; the ener- gy in a radioactive nucleus before it decays; and mass (via E = mc 2 ). Kinetic energy, as well as the obvious macro- scopic motion of bodies (where KE = \u0001 \u0002 mv 2 ), includes thermal energy produced by the motion of atoms and molecules. In a closed system energy (or more correctly mass and energy) is conserved, that is to say, the total amount of energy is constant although it may be convert- ed from one form to another within the system. The energy radiated by stars arises from different processes at different points in their lives. During the for- mation of a star, gravitational potential energy is being released; throughout most of its active life the energy then comes from nucleosynthesis reactions, while at the end, it is radiating stored thermal energy. Gravitational potential energy is negative since it is clearly zero when two bodies are separated by an infinite distance, and energy is released as they come closer together. For the Universe as a whole it is possible that the total amount of gravitational potential energy balances all other forms of energy so that the net energy of the Universe is zero.

It is also often interpreted as the degree of disorder of a system, for example entropy is lower in a crystal of salt and a drop of pure water, and higher in the less-structured system obtained when the salt crystal is dissolved in the water. When work is done by a system, the entropy increases by an amount equal to the energy released divided by the operating temperature. When work is done on a system the entropy similarly decreases. In an ideal reversible sys- tem undergoing equal and opposite changes, the increase in entropy during one change would be balanced by the decrease during the other. The entropy would then be the same at the end of the series of changes as it was at the beginning. All real processes, however, are to some extent irreversible, and therefore such a cycle results in the entropy being higher after the changes than before. Thus in any closed system entropy increases (or at best remains constant) with time. The level of disorder of the system, or its ability to do work, likewise increases with time. If the Universe is a closed system, then the increase of entropy with time leads to the idea of the HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE . In other words, the Universe will eventual- ly become a uniform mix of basic particles at a uniform temperature and with any one part of it being quite indis- tinguishable from any other. ephemeris T able giving the predicted positions of a celestial object, such as a planet or comet, at some suitable time step, so that the position at intermediate times can be obtained by interpolating between tabular v alues. See also ALMANAC Ephemeris Time (ET) Timescale used by astronomers from 1960 until 1984 in computing the predicted posi- tions, or ephemerides, of the Sun, Moon and planets. Because the rotation of the Earth on its axis is not regular, neither MEAN SOLAR TIME nor SIDEREAL TIME are accurate enough for computing the gravitational equations of motion required for ephemerides. Ephemeris Time was based in principle on the Earth’s revolution around the Sun, and in practice on the orbital motion of the Moon, since these are less affected by unpredictable forces than is the rotation of the Earth. It therefore provided a timescale that was more uniform in the long term than others but w as replaced in 1984 by D YNAMICAL TIME . epicycle In the PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM and earlier systems, a small circle around which a planet was supposed to move; the centre of the epicycle moved, in turn, on a larger circle, the DEFERENT , centred on the Earth.

Epimetheus has a near-circular orbit, with a very slight tilt to Saturn’s equator (inclination only 0º.34), at an average distance of 151,400 km (94,100 mi) from the planet’s centre. Its orbital period is 0.695 days. See also JANUS epoch Date at which a set of ORBITAL ELEMENTS had the particular values quoted. An orbit is specified by six orbital elements.

For comets and newly discovered asteroids the sixth element is taken as the time of PERIHELION passage. This property of the orbit should be independent of the date (epoch) at which a set of elements is determined. So for this form of elements used for comets and asteroids the epoch of the elements does not have the significance that it does when the sixth element is the mean longitude or mean anomaly. Epsilon Aurigae ECLIPSING BINARY star that after more than 150 years of observation and scientific research is still not fully understood. The variability of Epsilon Aurigae was first observed in 1821 by a German pastor, J. M. Fritsch, but it was spectroscopic observations by Hans Ludendorff (1873–1941) at the turn of the 20th century that produced the first significant data. The period is approximately 9892 days, which is the longest known for an eclipsing binary. The primary component of Epsilon Aurigae is a lumi- nous SUPERGIANT star that exhibits an F0-type spectrum. It is a naked-eye object with apparent magnitude \u0001 3.0 at maximum brightness and \u0001 4.1 during primary eclipse. Recent reports associate semiregular pulsations with the primary, but it is on the whole not a particularly remark- able star. All the interest in Epsilon Aurigae is associated with the mysterious companion star. The primary F0 spectrum is observed at all phases of the system’s revolu- tion (even at primary minimum) and, more surprisingly, no single feature has yet been observed that may be assigned to the secondary. The light-curve of Epsilon Aurigae is also unusual. Pri- mary eclipse has been observed in 1928–30, 1955–57 and 1982–84. This minimum is ‘flat-bottomed’ such that the total phase lasts approximately 400 days within an entire eclipse phase of approximately 700 days. The flat-bot- tomed nature of the primary minimum normally implies that the primary component is eclipsed by a larger com- panion. At primary eclipse the apparent magnitude of Epsilon Aurigae decreases by 0.8 mag. Such a consider- able reduction in brightness would normally imply that the two components have similar surface brightness. A similar loss in brightness, therefore, would be expected when the secondary component is eclipsed by the prima- ry , in which case a secondary minimum of comparable depth to the primary minimum should be observed. In the case of Epsilon Aurigae, however, no secondary mini- mum is observed at all. Thus, evidence concerning the nature of the sec- ondary component of Epsilon Aurigae is inconclusive and apparently contradictory. More sophisticated obser- va tions have been made and various models proposed in order to explain them. Early models concentrated on the possibility of a sec- ondary component larger than the primary. One idea pro- poses an object some 3000 times larger than the Sun. It is suggested that the object is cool (perhaps less than 1000 K), emitting strongly at infrared wavelengths but remaining sufficiently dim at optical wavelengths to explain observations. Furthermore, this object would be tenuous and therefore semitransparent, explaining why the primary component spectrum is observed unchanged even during primary eclipse. The major problem facing models of this kind is that such large tenuous bodies are not capable of blocking enough radiation from the primary component during eclipse to reduce the apparent brightness by the observed amount. Infrared photometry of Epsilon Auri- gae in 1964 by Frank Low (1933– ) and R. Mitchell showed no evidence for a cool object of the type envis- aged in these models. Earlier, the Italian astronomer Margherita Hack (1922– ) proposed a model for Epsilon Aurigae in which a a small secondary component might explain the complete absence of a secondary minimum in the light-curve. If this object were hot and luminous, however, it would be diffi- cult to understand the absence of a secondary contribu- tion to the observed spectrum. Moreover, with a small secondary object there is difficulty once again in explain- ing the extent to which brightness is reduced during pri- mary eclipse. It is not clear how the secondary component could block so much radiation from the primary and yet not be noticeable as it, in turn, is eclipsed. From detailed analysis of the spectrum of Epsilon Aurigae, Otto Struve pointed out that the primary com- ponent seemed to possess an extended atmosphere. This led to interpretations based on the idea of a small dark secondary star and a region of dusty matter situated between the two components. A disk of dust viewed edge-on, for example, could conceivably mask radiation from the primary star to the observed degree. Attention was once again lavished upon Epsilon Auri- gae during the eclipse of 1982–84. Observations suggest that the plane of the occulting disk does not coincide with the binary’s orbital plane and that the disk itself is wa r ped. Such a configuration could be sustained if the invisible secondary were actually a pair of white dwarf stars. The problem is unlikely to be resolved before the next eclipse takes place in 2009.

Right ascension is measured along the celestial equator in hours, minutes and seconds eastwards from the FIRST POINT OF ARIES , the intersection of the celestial equator with the ECLIPTIC . Declination is measured from 0º to \u0001 90º between the celestial equator and the north CELESTIAL POLE , and from 0º to \u0002 90º between the celestial equator and the south celestial pole. HOUR ANGLE and POLAR DISTANCE can be used as alternative measures. equatorial mounting T elescope mounting in which one axis, the polar axis , is parallel to Earth’s axis of rotation, and the telescope can be moved about the other axis, the declination axis , which is perpendicular to the polar axis. With an equatorial mount, it is possible to track objects across the sky by using a DRIVE mechanism to turn the polar axis at the sidereal rate of one rotation per 23 h 56 m . Smooth, efficient driving depends on having the telescope carefully balanced by appropriate counterweights to minimize stress on the motor and its gear assembly. There are a number of variations on the equatorial mounting. In the German mounting (invented by J ohann von FRAUNHOFER ), the centre of mass of the tele- scope lies near one end of the declination axis. Medium- sized amateur REFLECTING TELESCOPES are commonly placed on German mountings, which can be quite portable. The main limitation is in access to the sky in the direction of the celestial pole, where the mounting itself may get in the way of the telescope. Another limitation is the transmission of vibrations from the mounting’s pier, particularly to smaller, lighter telescopes. An alternative is the English mounting , where a cra- dle (yoke) aligned with the polar axis holds the telescope, allowing movement in declination on two pivots. A fur- ther variation replaces the cradle with a polar-axis bar, to which the telescope is attached at a single pivot. The English equatorial mounting allows greater access to the sky around the pole than does the German mounting. To gain access to the areas of sky below the pole, how- ever, a further variation is necessary. In such horseshoe mountings , the upper part of the polar axis is designed with a gap sufficiently large to accommodate the telescope. F ork mountings are similar to the cradle form of English equatorial, with the telescope held between two arms of a fork aligned with the polar axis. Such mountings are often used for short-tubed SCHMIDT – CASSEGRAIN instruments. Although equatorial mounts were for a long time the standard for large telescopes, developments in computers and automated drive systems have led to modern profes- sional instruments being mounted on ALTAZIMUTH MOUNTINGS . Similarly, many amateur GO TO TELESCOPES are provided with altazimuth mounts. equinoctial colure Great circle on the CELESTIAL SPHERE that passes through the two CELESTIAL POLES and intersects the CELESTIAL EQUATOR at the FIRST POINT OF ARIES and the FIRST POINT OF LIBRA (also known as the equinoctial points). See also SOLSTITIAL COLURE equinox Tw o instances each year at which the Sun appears to cross the CELESTIAL EQUATOR . The spring or VERNAL EQUINOX occurs around March 21, when the Sun is overhead at the terrestrial equator, crossing from south to north. The A UTUMNAL EQUINOX occurs when it crosses from north to south, around September 23. At the time of the equinoxes, day and night are of equal length all ov er the world (the word equinox means ‘equal night’), the Sun rising due east and setting due west on those days. The term is also used to describe the two points on the CELESTIAL SPHERE where the celestial equator intersects with the ECLIPTIC – the FIRST POINT OF ARIES and the FIRST POINT OF LIBRA . The effects of PRECESSION cause these points to move westwards along the ecliptic at a rate of about one-seventh of an arcsecond per day. The equinox defined for a particular day is known as the true or apparent equinox and the inclusion of leap days into the CALENDAR every four years ensures that the true equinoxes always occur around the same date. equivalence principle Principle stating that the gr a vitational mass of an object is exactly equal to the inertial mass of the object. Another formulation states that in any enclosed volume of spacetime, one cannot differentiate between an acceleration caused by gravity and one caused by any other force. This principle is one of the pillars upon which GENERAL RELATIVITY is built.

Eratosthenes is located at the end of the Montes APENNINES . It is a complex crater, with central peaks and side-wall terracing. Its ejecta is overlain by that of COPERNICUS , and its ray pattern has been eroded by micrometeorite bombardment; deeper impressions of its ejecta are still visible at low Sun angles. Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276–194 BC ) Greek geographer, mathematician and astronomer who was the first accurately to determine the Earth’s circumference. He was the third librarian at Alexandria, where the library contained hundreds of thousands of literary and scientific w orks of classical antiquity. He learned that on the date of the summer solstice, the noonday Sun cast no shadow at Syene (now Aswan, Egypt), and illuminated the bottom of a vertical well there. He observed that, on the same day, the Sun cast a measurable shadow at Alexandria, located due north on approximately the same meridian as Syene. Using a GNOMON (a vertical stake) Eratosthenes found the Sun’s zenith distance at Alexandria to be about 1/50th of a complete circle. The Earth’s circumference 133 E ERIDANUS ( GEN . ERIDANI , ABBR .

It is arguable how well he knew this distance, but his estimate in modern terms is about 47,000 km (29,000 mi), quite close to the correct value of 40,075 km (24,900 mi). Eratosthenes also measured the tilt of the Earth’s axis of rotation as 23º51 \u0001 15 \u0002 , and compiled a catalogue of 675 naked-eye stars. His mathematical work led him to develop many essential basic concepts of geometry. In geography he divided the Earth’s globe into five zones – a torrid zone bordered by two temperate zones, which in turn were bor- dered by two frigid regions. He was also a chronologist, being the first Greek scientifically to date historical events; he constructed a calendar that contained leap years.

It is named after its inventor, the German optician Heinrich Erfle (1884–1923). Eridanus See feature article, page 133 Eros First NEAR - EARTH ASTEROID to be discovered, in 1898; number 433. With perihelion at 1.13 AU and aphelion at 1.78 AU, the orbit of Eros encompasses that of Mars, and it is classed as an AMOR ASTEROID . It is likely the second-largest object in that class (after GANYMED ). Eros’ ability to come fairly close to us makes it a particularly bright asteroid. In 1931 Eros passed within 23 million km (14 million mi) of the Earth, and a global programme of measurements of its position relative to background stars was organized in order to determine its parallax and thus its distance. From this effort an improved determination of the ASTRONOMICAL UNIT was expected, but the value derived was slightly too high. In 1975 another concerted campaign of observations was organized for a subsequent close approach by Eros. Eros was the main target of the NEAR SHOEMAKER space probe, which orbited the asteroid for a full year beginning in 2000 February, before being guided to make a soft landing early in 2001. Many close-up images of this asteroid were returned, plus other science data. The size of Eros was determined to be about 33 \u0003 13 \u0003 13 km (21 \u0003 8 \u0003 8 mi), and its mass 6.7 \u0003 10 20 kg. Its rotation peri- od is 5.27 hours. Eros is an S-type asteroid, with an ALBE - DO of 0.16. See also MATHILDE eruptive variable Member of a large heterogeneous class of V ARIABLE STARS . The class contains many little- understood objects, ranging from SUPERNOVAE , through interacting binary systems, to flare activity on single stars and the ejection of shells of matter by a variety of objects. The complex phenomena in CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE , SYMBIOTIC STAR and NOVA systems (such as rapid varia- tions, large outbursts and X-ray emission) are primarily caused by the effects of orbital motion, varying rates of mass exchange, and thermonuclear burning of hydrogen that the WHITE DWARF (or possibly NEUTRON STAR ) in inter- acting binary systems has acquired from its companion. Related objects include X-ray transients such as A0538-66 in which a neutron star is in a highly eccentric orbit about a hot (B-type) giant. When the outer envelope of the hot star is sufficiently distended, the neutron star passes through it, giving rise to a burst of optical and X- ray radiation. Supernovae owe their outbursts to the rapid release of thermonuclear energy, which leads to the ejec- tion of large amounts of mass and the formation of a neu- tron star. In the case of Type I supernovae, MASS TRANSFER from a companion to a white dwarf in a binary system may initiate its explosion. UV CETI STARS , for example PROXIMA CENTAURI , are RED DWARF stars showing flare activity ( see FLARE STAR ). Some red dwarfs, such as BY DRACONIS STARS , show light va ri a tions that can be attributed to large starspots (roughly analogous to SUNSPOTS ). The rotation of the star carries the spots periodically in and out of view, causing the observed light variations. Starspots are a magnetic phe- nomenon. Magnetic fields constrain the flow of matter and energy near the stellar surface, and lower temperature regions (the spots) form where the magnetic tubes of force cluster. Some red dwarfs are simultaneously BY Draconis and UV Ceti stars. Starspots are also found on the giant and subgiant components in some CLOSE BINARY systems (the RS CVB stars). TTA URI STARS are very young (pre- MAIN SEQUENCE ) objects generally found in regions of recent star formation. They show flaring activity and a strong, variable, chro- mospheric-type emission spectrum. As in UV Ceti stars, such activity is probably caused by the very strong mag- netic field produced in a rapidly rotating star. S DORADUS STARS are hot, very luminous, supergiants with dense expanding envelopes. Similar, but somewhat fainter, are the GAMMA CASSIOPEIAE STARS , which often show irregular variability because outflow of matter in their equatorial planes forms disks and rings. R CORONAE BOREALIS va ri ables have evolved past the red-giant stage and have ejected their hydrogen-rich envelopes to expose a carbon-rich, hydrogen-poor core. Their irregular declines in brightness (by up to about 9 magnitudes) are caused by obscuration by clouds of car- bon particles, each cloud covering only a limited area of the stellar surface (perhaps about 3%). Declines occur when a cloud is ejected in our line of sight; clouds ejected in other directions can be detected spectroscopically and in the infrared. The process of mass ejection may be related to the pulsations which at least some eruptive va r iables undergo.

It occurs between April 24 and May 20, with a broad maximum over a couple of days around May 4–5. The shower, with peak zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) as high as 50, is, like October’s ORIONIDS , produced by debris from Comet 1P/ HALLEY . At this encounter, Earth meets the METEOR STREAM at its descending node. Eta Aquarids are swift, at 67 km/s (42 mi/s), and yellowish; they often leave persistent TRAINS . The shower is best seen from southerly latitudes. Eta Carinae One of the most luminous stars in our Galaxy. When the southern stars were catalogued, Eta Carinae was a third-magnitude star, but from 1833 it began to vary irregularly, becoming at its brightest second only to SIRIUS . What makes this performance remarkable is the great distance of the star, which was then unknown but is now recognized to be about 8000 l.y. Since it is obscured by a bright, diffuse nebula (the ETA CARINAE NEBULA ), the star’s distance cannot be found with any certainty. At its peak brightness, however, Eta Carinae shone some four million times as brightly as the Sun. The star then faded to just below naked-eye visibility. At the same time, a nebulous patch, called the HOMUNCULUS , formed and expanded around it. The nebula has a double-lobed structure, with an expansion velocity of about 30 km/s (20 mi/s) near the centre but up to 1000 km/s (600 mi/s) at the outer edge. The total amount of mass in the nebula is about ten times the mass of the Sun. Although optically hidden by the nebula, Eta Carinae is the brightest infrared source in the sky (apart from Solar System objects), which shows that it continues to shine about as brightly to this day as it did last century. The drop in its magnitude was caused by the surrounding neb- ula, and since the mid-1900s the star has gradually bright- ened in visual light as the extinction by dust decreases. Studies of the light reflected from the dust cloud show that the central object varies in emission lines, especially those of hydrogen and neutral helium, with a period of 5.52 years. This suggests that the central object is in fact a BINARY STAR system, consisting of two stars of about 80 solar masses orbiting each other at a distance of about 20 AU. The shape of the bipolar nebula may have been caused by the fact that it is a binary system.

Eudoxus was the first astronomer to make a specific note of the bright southern star Canopus. Like PLATO before him, Eudoxus’ cosmology consisted of a system of planets fixed to the surfaces of ‘homocen- tric’ crystalline spheres rotating on axes passing through the Earth’s centre. He adjusted Plato’s model to fit better the observed planetary motions by postulating that each of the spheres had its poles set to those of the next sphere, and that the axes of rotation were not fixed in space. Addi- tional spheres were constructed to portray the movements of the planets against the fixed stars and the apparent daily rotation of the stars. In this way he was able to explain the retrograde motions of Jupiter and Saturn, but not of Mars. Although Eudoxus probably considered the homocentric crystalline spheres merely as a mathematical model, ARIS - TO TLE imagined that they had a physical existence.

Europa Smallest of the GALILEAN SATELLITES of JUPITER ; it is only slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon and is thus a substantial world in its own right. It is in orbital RESONANCE with both IO and GANYMEDE , such that for every four complete orbits by Io, Europa makes two orbits and Ganymede one. The resulting TIDAL HEATING makes Europa an active world, and it is a prime target for exploration for extraterrestrial life in a salty ocean inferred to exist below its thin icy shell. In contrast to the more strongly tidally heated (and ice-free) Io, however, no surface changes have been seen to occur on Europa during the era of close-up imaging by VO YA GERS 1 and 2 (1979) and the GALILEO orbiter (1995–2001). Europa’s density, of 2.97 g/cm 3 , almost puts it in the terrestrial planet league, but its exterior is icy down to a depth of about 100 km (60 mi). It is not known whether the ice is solid throughout, or whether its lower part is liq- uid, which raises the fascinating possibility of a global ocean sandwiched between the solid ice and the underly- ing rock. Gravity data from Galileo show that, like Io, Europa has a dense, presumably iron-rich CORE (about 620 km/390 mi in radius) below its rocky MANTLE . Europa has its own magnetic field, but it is unclear whether this is generated by convection within a liquid core or within a salty ocean beneath the ice. Europa has a highly reflective surface with an albedo of about 0.7. Since the 1950s it has been known from spec- troscopic studies that the surface is composed essentially of clean water-ice. More detailed recent observations by Galileo and the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE have revealed regions where the ice appears to be salty; they have also revealed the presence of molecular oxygen (O 2 ) and ozone (O 3 ). The oxygen and ozone are thought to result from the breakdown of water molecules in the ice by exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation and charged parti- cles from the SOLAR WIND . Hydrogen thus liberated would escape rapidly into space, as has been observed on Ganymede though not on Europa. It is not known whether the oxygen and ozone detected on Europa consti- tute an extremely tenuous atmosphere or whether they are mainly trapped within the ice. Europa’s surface is relatively smooth and much y ounger than that of other icy satellites, to judge from the paucity of impact craters. This paucity demonstrates that Europa experiences a rapid rate of resurfacing, driven by tidal heating, though it is not so rapid as on Io. Neither of the Voyager probes passed close to Europa, so even the best Voyager images revealed few features smaller than a few hundred metres across. They were ade- quate, however, to show a bright surface with low topo- g raphic relief, criss-crossed by a complex pattern of cracks filled by darker ice. There are several places where the pattern of these bright plains becomes blotchy, and these were dubbed ‘mottled terrain’ by the Voyager inves- tigators. The high-resolution images sent back by Galileo show that the bright plains are amazingly complex in detail, being composed of multiple families of straight or slightly curved ridges, each usually bearing a central gr oove. The appearance of these parts of Europa has been described as resembling the surface of a ball of string, a g raphic description that casts no light on how the surface w as created. Each grooved ridge probably represents a fis- sure, where some kind of icy lava was erupted during an episode of CRYOVOLCANISM . Although by far the most abundant component in Europa’s ice is water, it is likely to be contaminated by var- ious salts (such as sulphates, carbonates and chlorides of magnesium, sodium and potassium) and possibly by sul- phuric acid, resulting from chemical reactions between wa ter and the underlying rock. Contaminants such as these could make any melt liberated from the ice behave in Eugenia 136 E \u0001 Europa A mosaic of images obtained by the Galileo orbiter, showing ‘ice rafts’ on the surface of Jupiter’s satellite Europa.

If erupted as a liquid, this type of lava would not necessarily spread far before congealing, especially if confined by a chilled skin of the sort likely to form upon exposure to the vacu- um of space. Contaminants also allow the ice to begin to melt at a much lower temperature than pure water-ice: salts can depress the melting temperature by a few degrees, and sulphuric acid by as much as 55 K. Europa’s ridges are perhaps highly viscous cryovol- canic flows fed from lengthwise fissures. Alternatively, rather than flowing across the ground, the cryovolcanic lava could have been flung up from the fissure in semi- molten clods by mild explosive activity and fallen back to coalesce as a rampart on either side of the fissure. Each fissuring event must represent the opening of an extensional fracture in the crust. This cannot happen across an entire planetary body unless the globe is expanding, which seems highly unlikely. There must, therefore, be some regions on Europa where the surface has been destroyed at a rate sufficient to match the crustal extension elsewhere. Galileo images revealed like- ly candidates for such regions in some of the mottled ter- rain imaged by Voyager. Here, in regions such as Conamara Chaos, the crust has been broken into ‘rafts’ that have drifted apart, maybe because an underlying liq- uid ocean broke through to the surface. The areas between rafts are a random jumble reminiscent of refrozen sea-ice on Earth. Some rafts can be fitted back together, but many pieces of the ‘jigsaw puzzle’ seem to be missing, having perhaps been sunk or dragged down beneath the surface. Other regions of mottled terrain are not totally dis- r upted into chaos, but instead contain a scattering of domes up to 15 km (9 mi) across; these were perhaps caused by ‘pods’ of molten or semi-fluid low-density material rising towards the surface. In some cases the upwelling pod has ruptured the surface to form a minia- ture chaos region bearing raftlets of surviving crust. Although little is understood about the processes that have shaped Europa’s surface, it is clear that the satellite has had a complicated history. We cannot tell how old each region of the surface is, but there are abundant signs that there is, or at least has been, a liquid zone below the surface. A salty ocean below several kilometres of ice is not necessarily a hostile environment for life. Indeed, life could be richer and more complex than any- thing that is likely to have survived on Mars. In the depths of Earth’s oceans are living communities that are independent of photosynthetic plants and depend instead on bacteria that feed on the chemical energy sup- plied by springs of hot water (hydrothermal vents). Since Europa is tidally heated, perhaps water is drawn down into the rocky mantle, where it becomes heated, dissolves chemicals out of the rock and emerges at hydrothermal v ents that are surrounded by life. The possibility of a life-bearing ocean below the ice has set the agenda for the future exploration of Europa, beginning with NASA’s proposed EUROPA ORBITER mission. Europa Orbiter NASA spacecraft that may be launched in about 2005 to EUROPA , the fourth-largest satellite of JUPITER and one that has gained the rank of the highest priority target since the discovery of a possible sub- surface ocean beneath a sheet of ice from data and images collected by the GALILEO orbiter. Internal heating may be melting the relatively young and thin 1-km (3300-ft) ice pack, forming an ocean of water underneath. NASA’s proposed Europa Orbiter mission (scheduled to orbit Europa from about 2007 to 2009) has the prima- ry goal of verifying the existence of an ocean below the ice. It will identify places where the ice is thin enough for future landing missions to send robotic submarines – ‘hydrobots’ – through the ice to hunt for hot springs and their attendant life. It will achieve this by using an altime- ter to determine the height of the tide raised on Europa by Jupiter. The tide should be only 1 m (3 ft) if the ice is solid throughout, but about 30 m (100 ft) if there is 10 km (6 mi) of ice overlying a global ocean. It will also use ice- penetrating radar to map ice thickness. High-resolution conventional images will identify sites of recent eruptions. European Southern Observatory (ESO) Major astro- nomical institution supported by ten European nations, founded in 1962 to operate world-class astronomical facilities in the southern hemisphere and to further inter- national collaboration in astronomy. The partner coun- tries are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland and, since 2002, the UK. ESO operates two high-altitude sites in the Atacama desert in northern Chile. They are the LA SILLA OBSERVATORY – location of several optical tele- scopes with diameters up to 3.6 m (141 in.), together with a 15-m (49-ft) submillimetre radio telescope – and the P ARANAL OBSERVATORY , home of the VERY LARGE TELESCOPE . At the organization’s headquarters in Garching, near Munich, technical development pro- g rammes are carried out to provide the Chilean facilities with advanced instrumentation, and there is also an astronomical D ATA CENTRE . European Space Agency (ESA) Principal European space organization whose programme includes launchers, space science, telecommunications, Earth observation and manned spaceflight. It began work in 1975, two years after ten European countries had agreed to combine the aims of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) and the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO) in a single agency. Today, ESA has 15 member states in Europe and includes Canada as a Cooperating State. It has laboratories throughout Europe and overseas. Its headquarters are in Paris, while its Space Operations Centre (ESOC) is at Darmstadt in Germany. The European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) is ESA’s biggest establishment, situated at Noordwijk in the Netherlands. ESA’s early years were spent regaining ground lost by the failure of its predecessors to develop a European launch vehicle. A turning point came in 1986 with the outstanding success of the agency’s GIOTTO spacecraft, which was launched on a European rocket. Since then, ESA has become a major player in the space industry. Its ARIANE rockets now command the global market in space launches, especially for communications satellites. It has developed some of the world’s most advanced telecom- munications and Earth-monitoring satellites, and is a full partner in the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION , building on the achievements of ESA astronauts on MIR and the SPACE SHUTTLE . The agency is a partner with the NATIONAL AERONAU - TICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) in high-profile space projects such as the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE and the SOHO solar observatory, and the Huygens lander for 137 E \u0001 European Southern Observatory The European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal in Chile’s Atacama Desert.

European VLBI Network (EVN) Powerful interferometric array of radio telescopes across Europe and beyond, formed in 1980. The network consists of 18 individual instruments, among them some of the largest and most sensitive radio telescopes in the world, such as the LOVELL TELESCOPE and the Effelsberg Radio T elescope. The EVN is administered by the European Consortium for VLBI ( see VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY ), and incorporates 14 major institutes.

This perturbation was discovered by PTOLEMY around AD 140. Prior to this the knowledge of the Moon’s orbit w as limited to the discovery of the ECCENTRICITY of the orbit and the rotation of the line of apsides by HIPPARCHUS in around 140 BC . In the years following Ptolemy, various refinements to this model of the evection were proposed, but no further major improvement in the knowledge of the Moon’s orbit was made until the discovery of the variation by Tycho BRAHE in around AD 1580. evening star Another name for the planets VENUS or MERCURY when either appears, following superior con- junction, as a bright object in the western sky after sun- set. Because of its appearance in both the evening and morning skies, at different times, the ancient Greeks thought Venus was two separate objects: an evening star, which they named Hesperus, and a MORNING STAR , which they called Phosphorus. Mercury under the same circumstances was known as Hermes (evening star) and Apollo (morning star). event horizon Boundary of a BLACK HOLE beyond which no information is available because no form of radiation can escape. It is the point at which the ESCAPE VELOCITY of the object becomes equal to the speed of light. In a non-rotating black hole with no charge, the event horizon is equal to the SCHWARZSCHILD RADIUS . Evershed, John (1864–1956) English astronomer who in 1908 discovered radial motions of gases in sunspots, now known as the EVERSHED EFFECT . Originally an amateur astronomer who distinguished himself by discoveries made with home-made equipment on expeditions to observe total solar eclipses, Evershed was a founding member of the British Astronomical Association (1890) and directed its solar and spectroscopic sections. He designed a high-dispersion solar spectrograph using large liquid prisms as the dispersive element, and was able to discover new spectral lines in the Sun’s corona. He also made major contributions to the study of cometary structure, using spectroscopy to show that their nuclei contain high concentrations of cyanogens. Evershed effect Radial, outwards flow of gases in the penumbra of SUNSPOTS at the level of the PHOTOSPHERE . It w as discovered in 1908 by John Evershed from the DOPPLER EFFECT of lines in the spectra of sunspots. The mean flow velocity is 2 km/s (1.2 mi/s). At higher levels in the solar atmosphere, the flow is inwards and downwards, and of higher velocity (around 20 km/s or 12 mi/s).

The term is usually used in the context of ELECTRONS in AT OMS , IONS and molecules being raised to a higher energy level than the GROUND STATE . Electrons may be excited by gaining energy from photons or by collisions with other a toms; they normally return to the ground state by emitting radiation. See also BOLTZMANN ’ SEQUA TION exit pupil Fo r a telescope, the image of the primary mirror or lens as seen through the eyepiece. The point at which this image is formed is the optimum position for the observer’s eye, so for comfort it should not be too close to the eyepiece itself ( see EYE RELIEF ). For any eyepiece–telescope combination, the size of the exit pupil can be found by dividing the eyepiece’s FOCAL LENGTH by the FOCAL RATIO of the telescope. On an f /8 instrument, for example, a 24-mm eyepiece will have an exit pupil of 3 mm. Ideally, to deliver most light, the exit pupil should be around 7 mm, equivalent to the maximum pupillary dilation of the dark-adapted eye ( see D ARK ADAPTATION ). exobiology See LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE Exosat Name given to a EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY X-ray astronomy satellite launched in 1983 May. Smaller than the EINSTEIN OBSERVATORY , it contained two X - RAY TELE - SCOPES and non-imaging X-ray detectors. Placed in a highly elliptical Earth orbit, observations lasting up to 90 hours were possible. The long observing times permitted major advances in studies of X - RAY BINARIES , stellar CORO - NAE , quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray sources and the properties of QU ASARS and SEYFERT GALAXIES . The mis- sion ended in 1986. See also X - RAY ASTRONOMY exosphere Outermost region of a planetary ATMO SPHERE , from which atoms and molecules may escape into interplanetary space. The pressure of an a tmospheric layer decreases with increasing altitude so that, eventually, the atmosphere is so thin that the collisions between the gaseous species become very infrequent. (That is, the mean free path becomes extremely long.) Ultimately, there is a level at which there are no collisions; the fast-moving atmospheric constituents may then escape the gravitational influence of the planet European VLBI Network 138 E \u0001 Explorer Seen here with a model of Explorer 1 are Dr W illiam H.

That the Universe is expanding was first demonstrated observationally in 1929 by Edwin HUBBLE , although the possibility had been suggested earlier on theoretical grounds by Willem de Sitter (1917), Aleksandr Friedmann (1922) and Georges Lemaître (1927). The evidence Hubble found was that if he took a spectrum of a galaxy, the spectral lines would always be redshifted by an amount proportional to the distance he estimated for the galaxy. This relationship is commonly called the HUBBLE LAW . F or distant galaxies, this expansion velocity is an appreciable portion of the speed of light. Recessional v elocities of this magnitude would be difficult to under- stand if the galaxies were moving through space, but make perfect sense if the Universe itself were expanding. GENERAL RELATIVITY interprets this expansion as the expansion of SPACETIME itself, and even predicts that it should obey a linear law such as the Hubble law. If this expansion is extrapolated backwards until spacetime was a singular point, then the age of the Universe can be esti- mated. These ideas set the stage for the BIG BANG THEO - RY . Predictions made from these ideas include the temperature of the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND and the COSMIC ABUNDANCE . Explorer Series of small US scientific satellites, mostly launched into Earth orbit. Explorer 1, instrumented by J ames VA N ALLEN , discovered in 1958 the radiation belts g irdling the Earth. Of the 72 successful Explorer missions launched by the end of 2000, five had operated for 10 years or more. extinction Loss of light from the line of sight as it passes through a medium. The loss may be by SCATTERING , in which case the light energy is taken up by the medium and promptly re-emitted at the same energy but redirected out of the line of sight. Or the loss may be by ABSORPTION , in which case the light energy is eventually re-emitted in a different form altogether, for example as heat. T ypical examples of extinction in astronomy are the loss of starlight as it passes through the interstellar medi- um and is scattered and absorbed by INTERSTELLAR GRAINS , and the loss of starlight as it passes through the Earth’s atmosphere and is scattered by air molecules. extrasolar planet (exoplanet) Planet not associated with our Solar System. The existence of other worlds, especially inhabited ones, has been the subject of debate since ancient times. In the 20th century, stars with irregular proper motions were suspected of having planetary companions; BARNARD ’ SSTAR w as a famous candidate. In 1992, after centuries of speculation and decades of false announcements, Dale Andrew Frail (1961– ) and D. Wolszcan detected the first extrasolar planets, orbiting the pulsar PSR 1257 + 12. In 1995 October, Michel Mayor (1942– ) and Didier Queloz (1966– ) found the first undisputed instance of a planet orbiting another main-sequence star, 51 Pegasi. By late 2001, about 85 planetary systems had been discovered around a wide diversity of stars up to 180 l.y. away; the table gives orbital parameters for ones of particular interest. Many of these substellar objects are in very close orbits and are many times the mass of Jupiter. The lower theoretical mass limit for a BROWN DWARF is about 0.013 solar mass, which is approximately 13 Jupiter masses (13 M J ); by convention, this is taken as the upper mass limit for a giant planet. There are now ten times as many planets known to orbit other stars than there are major planets in our Solar System. Taking into account stars with no detectable plan- ets, about 5% of main-sequence stars appear to have a g iant planet orbiting at less than 2 AU. The first extrasolar g iant planets were found 100 times closer to their parent star than expected. In standard models of planetary for- mation, Jupiter-sized planets form at a distance of 4–5 AU from solar-type stars. The very close orbits can be explained by a process known as orbital migration. Half the planets have orbits with unexpectedly large eccentrici- ties. These could result from migration: if two planets are migrating inwards at different rates, one could expel the other from the system and have its own orbit perturbed. There are three methods of detecting extrasolar plan- ets. Direct imaging is possible in principle, either by a planet’s reflected light from the parent star or by its infrared emission. But such reflected light or infrared radiation is extremely faint, and because the planet is extremely close to the star, it is very difficult to separate them; also, the image of the planet lies within the AIRY DISK of the star as seen through a telescope. There are two ways round this difficulty: reduce the size of the Airy disk so that the planet is outside it, or block the starlight. Shrinking the Airy disk would require a telescope with an aperture of 10–100 m (33–330 ft) or a multi-aperture interferometer, preferably in Earth orbit. Starlight can be blocked by a coronagraph, a physical obstruction at the telescope’s focus, or by a technique in which the star’s light is made to interfere destructively with itself without affecting the region around it. The second method is to search for the planet’s gravi- tational perturbation of its parent star. Both planet and star orbit their common centre of mass, and the small periodic change in the star’s proper motion is apparent in its radial velocity (a DOPPLER EFFECT ) and position on the sky. If the planet’s orbital plane coincides with our line or sight, the variation of radial velocity is greatest. Radial velocity and position vary cyclically with a period equal to the planet’s orbital period and an amplitude proportional to the planet’s mass. The precision in radial v elocity measurements is presently 3 m/s, which would enable the detection of planets similar in mass to Saturn. But there is no hope yet of detecting an Earth-like planet since it would give rise to a variation in the star’s radial v elocity of just 0.1 m/s. The third method of detection is by transits: if a planet crosses the face of its sun, it can produce, under favourable circumstances, a small drop for a few hours in the star’s light. The depth of the drop is given by the star- to-planet surface ratio: 1% for a jupiter, 0.01% for an earth. The planet’s orbital plane must be favourably ori- ented: the probability that an orbit is sufficiently close to edge-on is 0.5% for a planet 1 AU from its star and 139 E \u0001 extrasolar planet The 50 m/s periodic variation of the radial velocity of 51 Pegasi.

Jupiter-size planets can be detected in this way from the ground, and Earth-sized planets could be detected from space. The transit method was used to measure the radius of the planet orbiting the star HD 209458. The planet has a mass of 0.6 M J and its radius is 30% larger than Jupiter. In 2000 the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) detected absorption lines from the planet’s atmosphere during a transit that indicated the presence of sodium – the first indirect detection of an a tmospheric component of an extrasolar planet. The search for extrasolar planets is being stepped up, with many projects in the pipeline or under study. Astro- metric space missions include NASA’s Space Interfero- metric Mission (SIM), due for launch in 2009, and ESA’s GAIA project. The planned 2009 launch of the NEXT GENERATION SPACE TELESCOPE will increase the potential for discovery. Interferometric missions aimed at detecting Earth-like planets have been motivated by the search for LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE . They include ESA’s Darwin, con- sisting in its initial configuration of five orbiting 1.5-m (60-in.) telescopes separated by 20–100 m (65–330 ft), and NASA’s Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF). COROT is an ESA/CNES mission to be launched in 2004 to detect planetary transits. Its 250-mm (12-in.) aperture telescope should be able to detect tens of planets down to twice the Earth’s radius, some of which should orbit within the ECOSPHERE of their parent star. NASA’s Kepler project, due for launch in 2007, has a 1-m (40-in.) telescope that will view 100 square degrees of sky at a time and should be able to detect a few hundred Earth-like planets in stellar ecospheres. Finally, there is some evidence that not all extrasolar planets are orbiting stars: high-resolution infrared images of star-forming regions suggest the existence of what are called unbound or free-floating planets . Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) Proposal for a 29-m (95-ft) optical telescope, announced in 1996 by a consortium of several US institutions. The design is a scaled-up version of the HOBBY – EBERLY TELESCOPE , using 169 mirror segments and copying the HET’s simplified mounting to minimize costs. Since the ELT was proposed, the term ‘extremely large telescope’ has been applied to any optical/infrared telescope in the 25–30 metre class.

It carried three EUV telescopes, each sensitive to a different wa v elength band. A fourth telescope performed a high- sensitivity search over a limited part of the sky in a single EUV band. Its mission ended in 2000 December. extrinsic variable V ARIABLE STAR in which the changes in light occur as a result of some external (that is, mechanical) cause, rather than from internal changes, such as pulsation or eruptive processes. Typical sources of such variation are rotation ( see ALPHA 2 CANUM VENATICORUM STARS and BY DRACONIS STARS ), orbital motion ( see ECLIPSING VARIABLES , ELLIPSOIDAL V ARIABLES , REFLECTION VARIABLES ) and obscuration (certain NEBULAR VARIABLES and R CORONAE BOREALIS STARS ). See also INTRINSIC VARIABLE eyepiece (ocular) System of lenses in an optical instrument through which the observer views the image. The eyepiece is usually a composite LENS that magnifies the final real image produced by the optics. There are many different designs of eyepiece, all attempting to achieve the best result for a particular application. Most incorporate an eye lens that is closest to the eye and a field lens that is closest to the OBJECTIVE . The magnification provided by a telescope is calculat- ed by dividing its focal length by the focal length of the eyepiece used with it. Thus the magnification can be changed simply by changing the eyepiece; astronomical eyepieces come in standard sizes with a simple push-fit to facilitate this. Standard sizes are 0.965 inch (24 mm), 1.25 inch (31 mm) and 2 inch (51 mm), with 1.25 inch by far the commonest. When an eyepiece with a shorter focal length is used and the overall magnification increases, the field of view – the area of sky the observer can see – will decrease. How- ever, some eyepiece designs provide a larger field of view than others, and manufacturers often quote an apparent field of view determined by the acceptance angle of the eyepiece, which is typically around 40º. The telescopic field of view is the acceptance angle of the eyepiece divid- ed by the magnification. Wide-angle eyepieces can be designed to have acceptance angles up to 80º, but this additional width comes at the cost of increased distortion, particularly towards the edges of the field. Also important to eyepiece performance are the EXIT PUPIL and EYE RELIEF . A good eyepiece will be designed to limit various forms of optical ABERRATION .

Faculae are usually associated with SUNSPOTS , and are brighter than the surrounding medium by virtue of their higher (by about 300 K) temperatures; they are closely associated with the chromospheric network and bright PLAGE regions in the CHROMOSPHERE . Faculae can precede the appearance of a sunspot, in the same place, by many hours or even a few days, and can persist in the same location for many months after the sunspots have gone. The number of faculae varies in step with the approximately 11-year SOLAR CYCLE , with a greater number when there are more sunspots. The increased solar brightness as a result of faculae is greater than the decrease caused by sunspots, so there is an overall increase in the SOLAR CONSTANT at the maximum of the sunspot cycle. Polar faculae, occurring at much higher latitudes than the sunspot-forming regions, are common in the rising phase of the solar cycle. falling star Popular (chiefly US) non-scientific description of a METEOR .

A fault is typically formed by TECTONIC deformation of the outer solid parts of planets and satellites. Depending on the character of the displacement, several varieties of faults are distinguished. Normal faults are produced when displacement is essentially vertical and the hanging wall is depressed relative to the footwall. Strike-slip faults result when displacement of one side relative to the other is essentially horizontal.

Before 1900 FG Sagittae was a nor- mal blue star evolving to become a white dwarf. In 1901, however, it suddenly started to brighten in the photograph- ic (visual) and blue magnitude, and it brightened during most of the 20th century. The temperature dropped from ov er 10,000 K to about 4500 K, and at one point (around 1965) it was dropping by 250 K per year. The star has been va r iable for several decades, passing through the Cepheid INSTABILITY STRIP . In 1992 FG Sagittae’s brightness faded by several magnitudes in a manner similar to the fadings of the R CORONAE BOREALIS STARS (although the star is not as deficient in hydrogen as are the R Coronae Borealis vari- ables). There have been several more fading episodes since 1992. The dust clouds, which dim the light during these fading episodes, have a temperature between 700 K and 1000 K. FG Sagittae is a solar-mass star, and although sim- ilar to the unusual star SAKURAI ’ S OBJECT it evolves along a different track in the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM because it is less massive. Convection currents in the star’s a tmosphere have brought up material such as yttrium, zir- conium, cerium and lanthanum ( SP R OCESS elements) from deep inside the star, so its composition appears abnormal. The star is surrounded by the PLANETARY NEBULA it created around 6000 to 10,000 years ago, and the composition of the nebula is completely normal. fibril Linear dark structure in the solar CHROMOSPHERE seen in association with A CTIVE REGIONS . Fibrils are thought to mark out the chromospheric magnetic field. They are visualized in SPECTROHELIOGRAMS taken in the light of the HYDROGEN - ALPHA LINE . field curvature Distortion produced by an astronomical telescope, leading to differences in scale across an image’s width. Field curvature results from the fact that the image formed is not really flat, but is in fact a curved ‘surface’ on a concave sphere. An EYEPIECE will focus best at differing positions across the field. Photographic plates on SCHMIDT CAMERAS used for astrometry are curved to match the field curvature of the instrument. field equations Te rm generally used to refer to Einstein’s general relativistic field equations. These equations form the basis for Einstein’s laws of gravity and essentially relate the curvature of SPACETIME to the presence of mass and energy. In his theory of SPECIAL RELATIVITY , Einstein showed that matter and energy are equivalent, and related by E = mc 2 , which implies that energy also has to be included in any gravity calculation. So in the field equations, both mass and energy are represented by a quantity called the stress-energy tensor T \u0001\u0002 . This tensor is the source of the gravitational field. The field equations also describe how spacetime is wa r ped by the presence of the gravitational sources. The curvature information is contained in two quantities, the Riemann tensor ( R \u0001\u0002 ) and the Riemann scalar R . The geometry of the coordinate system is also included in the field equations and is represented by the quantity g \u0001\u0002 , called the metric tensor. Together, the field equations are R \u0001\u0002 \u0003 \u0001 \u0002 Rg \u0001\u0002 = 8 \u0004 G / c 4 T \u0001\u0002 where G is Newton’s universal constant of gravitation and c is the speed of light. The indices \u0001 and \u0002 represent each of the dimensions: length, width, height and time. Thus the equation above is actually 16 independent equations (4 2 ) that must be solved simultaneously. The major solu- tions of the field equations are the Schwarzschild solution for spherical geometry, the Kerr–Newmann solution for rotating black holes, and the Robertson–Walker metric for the entire universe. field of view Angular diameter of the area of sky visible through an optical instrument. See EYEPIECE field rotation Circular movement of a telescope’s field of view as a result of DIURNAL MOTION when using an instru- ment that is either on an altazimuth mounting or an equa- torial mounting whose polar axis is not properly aligned on the celestial pole. An image taken using such a system will show short star trails concentric with the field centre. A device called a field de - rotator is used to counter- rotate the image plane to allow long exposures through instruments with altazimuth mounts, as used with the majority of large modern professional telescopes. filament Dark, elongated, ribbon-like structure visible in SPECTROHELIOGRAMS of the Sun taken in the light of the HYDROGEN - ALPHA LINE or the H and K lines of calcium. A filament is a PROMINENCE seen in projection against the bright solar disk. filamentary nebula Interstellar nebula in which the material is in the form of highly elongated and often highly twisted intertwined clouds. Many nebulae of many types have filamentary structures within them, so the term filamentary nebulae is reserved for those nebulae in which the filaments make up the whole or the largest part of the nebula. The VEIL NEBULA , a SUPERNOVA REMNANT , is the best-known filamentary nebula. filter Optical element that absorbs some wavelengths of light whilst transmitting others. Filters are used to great effect in astronomy to isolate certain colours or wa v elengths, making them easier to observe or analyse. The most common are filters made of coloured glass or gelatin. In visual astronomy these are used to improve the contrast in planetary features. For example, if a light blue filter is used to observe Jupiter, the Great Red Spot will appear darker than normal so will stand out against the surrounding body of the planet. Similarly, a red filter will show up dark features on the surface of Mars. Colour filters are also used with monochromatic detec- tors such as photographic plates and CCD cameras. Tak- ing three separate images through red, green and blue filters, then recombining them in the dark room or elec- tronically will produce true-colour images. Interference filters are made of many layers of dielec- tric deposited on a glass substrate. Thirty or forty layers may be used to produce the exact characteristics needed. In this way, sky glow caused by mercury and sodium street-lights can be rejected whilst hydrogen and oxygen light from faint nebulae is allowed through. Interference filters designed to pass only one sharply defined wave- length are called monochromatic filters. Special solar filters are available for observing the Sun directly. High-density filters that cut out 99.999% of the incoming sunlight are used at the entrance aperture of a telescope to enable sunspots, faculae and surface granula- tion to be observed directly. Interference filters are used to reveal flares and prominences. Observing the Sun directly carries risk so advice should be sought from a specialist retailer or observatory before using a solar filter. finder Small, low-powered TELESCOPE with a wide field of view, attached to the tube of a larger instrument for the purpose of more easily locating celestial bodies. The nar- row field of view of a large telescope can make locating faint objects in particular quite difficult. The finder allows the observer to study a wide area of sky, and the two tele- scopes should be aligned so that when the object in ques- tion is centred on the cross wires of the smaller telescope, it appears in the centre of the field of view of the larger one. fine structure Splitting of orbital energy levels. An a tomic energy level for an orbiting electron is finely divided into substates as a result of the electron’s ability to have different quantized angular momenta; to these substates is added splitting caused by the magnetic coupling between the electron’s spin and its orbit. Each orbital level n of h ydrogen has n substates, each of which (except for the first) is split in half. Multiple electrons’ effects are combined. Transitions between fine structure states create the complex spectra of atoms heavier than hydrogen.

In either instance, first contact is the beginning of the eclipse. first light Te rm used to describe the first occasion on which a newly constructed telescope is used to observe a celestial object. This will occur only after all the optical components have been fully aligned but it will usually be some considerable time before the instrument is brought into full use, since a large amount of testing and calibrat- ing will still be required. Whilst normally used to refer to an optical telescope, the term is also applied to instru- ments operating at other wavelengths; for example the first time that a radio telescope detects signals from space. First Point of Aries P osition on the CELESTIAL SPHERE where the Sun’s centre crosses the celestial equator from south to north at the time of the VERNAL EQUINOX , on or around March 21 each year. This marks the intersection of the ECLIPTIC with the CELESTIAL EQUATOR at the Sun’s ASCENDING NODE ; it is used as the zero point for measuring CELESTIAL LONGITUDE , RIGHT ASCENSION and SIDEREAL TIME . Thus, when the First Point of Aries is exactly on an observer’s MERIDIAN , the sidereal time is 0 h 0 m 0 s . The small annual change in position of the celestial pole, known as PRECESSION , has caused this point on the celestial sphere to move slowly westwards along the eclip- tic by about one-seventh of an arcsecond each day, taking a period of around 25,800 years to complete a single revo- lution. Because of this, although originally located in the constellation of Aries, from whence it derived its name, it is has now drifted into neighbouring Pisces, although the name has remained unchanged. First Point of Libra P osition on the CELESTIAL SPHERE where the Sun’s centre crosses the celestial equator from north to south at the time of the A UTUMNAL EQUINOX , on or around September 23 each year. The effects of PRECESSION have caused it to move slowly westwards along the ecliptic by about one-seventh of an arcsecond each day, taking a period of around 25,800 years to complete a single revolution. This means that it is no longer located in Libra, but instead has drifted into the constellation of Virgo. first quarter See PHASES OF THE MOON Fish’s Mouth Region of dark nebulosity within the ORION NEBULA , close to the TRAPEZIUM stars (RA 05 h 35 m .3 dec. \u0001 05º23 \u0002 ). fission, nuclear NUCLEAR REACTION that involves a more massive nucleus splitting into two or more lighter nuclei or subatomic particles. For nuclei heavier than iron, the BINDING ENERGY per nucleon will increase during fission and so the reaction may result from spontaneous radioactivity. Thus, for example, uranium- 235 decays to thorium-231 and helium-4 (an \u0003 -particle). The binding energy per nucleon, however, will decrease during the fission of iron and lighter nuclei so that more energy is required to cause the reaction than is released during it. Hence light element fission can only occur if energy is supplied from an external source such as a high energy collision or a gamma-ray photon. In this way nuclei between sulphur and iron may be fragmented by photo-dissociation during SUPERNOVA explosions; in the interstellar medium, impacts with COSMIC RAY particles cause the break-up of elements like carbon, nitrogen and o xygen to produce lithium, beryllium and boron.

It was believed that the Earth lay at the centre of the Universe, surrounded by a solid crystal sphere to which the ‘fixed stars’ were attached. Nowadays, the term is used to describe those stars that have no detectable proper motion. Fizeau, (Armand) Hippolyte (Louis) (1819–96) French physicist who in 1849 made the first successful measurement of the velocity of light in an experiment carried out wholly on the Earth. He used a rapidly rotating toothed wheel which interrupted a fine beam of light before and after reflection from a distant mirror more than 8 km (5 mi) away. Fizeau collaborated with Léon FOUCAULT in his optics experiments. Flame Nebula EMISSION NEBULA in the constellation Orion, immediately east of \u0004 (RA 05 h 41 m .9 dec. \u0001 01º51 \u0002 ).

Flammarion, (Nicolas) Camille (1842–1925) French astronomer and prolific author of popular astronomy books, including L ’Astronomie populaire (1879). He w orked first (from 1858) at Paris Observatory, then from 1883 at his private observatory at Juvisy-sur-Orge, where he made serious studies of double stars and the planets using a 9.5-inch (240-mm) Bardou refractor. Flammarion’s epic two-volume work La Planète Mars et ses conditions d’habitabilité (1892, 1909) is an authoritative history of Mars observing which speculates about the possibility of life there. Flamsteed, John (1646–1719) English astronomer and clergyman, the first ASTRONOMER ROYAL and director of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. He was a y outhful convert to Copernicanism, admired Galileo and Kepler, and was deeply influenced by Tycho Brahe’s insistence upon precise observation as the basis for theory. In 1675 he was requested by the Royal Society to examine a method for finding longitude at sea proposed by the sieur de St Pierre. Flamsteed’s report, in which he stated that the longitude could not be reckoned until superior astronomical tables became available, caught the a ttention of King Charles II, who ordered the creation of the post of Astronomer Royal and the founding of the Greenwich Observatory. In spite of the royal appointment, Flamsteed had to pay for the observatory’s instruments out of his own pocket. At Greenwich, Flamsteed’s task was to make accurate positional measurements of the Moon and stars for use in F Flamsteed, John 143 F AST ENCY PHI fin 10/4/02 11:15 am Page 143"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"navigation. He pioneered three new precision instruments that transformed observation: the telescopic sight and the micrometer, both invented by William GASCOIGNE , and Christiaan Huygens’ pendulum clock for timing star tran- sits. He was a meticulous observer, and with instruments made by the clockmaker Thomas Tompion (1639–1713) he was able to measure the positions of stars and planets to within 10 \u0001 , over 40 times more accurately than Tycho Brahe had managed with his equipment. Observing every clear night for over 40 years at Green- wich, Flamsteed produced a body of data that set new standards in astronomical research. However, as some- thing of a perfectionist he was slow to release his results, to the irritation of Isaac NEWTON , and objected when the Royal Society published his uncorrected observations. The catalogue of his corrected observations, the Historia coelestis brittanica , was not published until 1725, after his death; the numbers assigned to stars in this catalogue ( FLAMSTEED NUMBERS ) are still in use. While his tables w ere still not sufficiently accurate to find longitude, they proved fundamental to Newton’s work on the lunar theory. Flamsteed numbers Sequence of numbering of the stars by constellation in order of right ascension, for purposes of identification. The numbers were assigned by later astronomers to stars in John FLAMSTEED ’s posthumously published star catalogue. The most w esterly star listed in Leo, for example, was designated 1L eonis. Many stars are still best known by their Flamsteed designations. flare Sudden, violent explosion on the Sun, lasting from a few minutes to a few hours; the local effects may persist for several days. Flares accelerate charged particles out into interplanetary space and down into the Sun. They emit ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION across the full spectrum. The frequency and intensity of solar flares increases near the maximum of the SOLAR CYCLE , and they are associated with A CTIVE REGIONS . Flares originate in the low CORONA , where magnetic energy is built up and stored in the magnetic fields of active regions. The flares are frequently triggered in com- pact structures just above the tops of coronal loops, where magnetic fields of opposite polarity are drawn together, releasing large amounts of stored energy (up to 10 25 J oule) by MAGNETIC RECONNECTION . Every second, the PHOTOSPHERE emits light with an energy that is at least one hundred times greater than the total energy emitted by any flare. Therefore, only excep- tionally powerful flares can be detected in the glare of visible sunlight. The first such white-light flare to be observed and recorded was seen by two Englishmen, Richard C. CAR - RINGTON and Richard Hodgson (1804–72), who noticed an intense brightening lasting for just a few minutes near a complex group of sunspots on 1859 September 1. Routine visual observations can be made by tuning into the red emission of the HYDROGEN - ALPHA LINE . Light at this 656.3 nm wavelength originates in the CHRO - MOSPHERE . When viewed in this way, solar flares appear as two extended parallel ribbons on either side of the magnetic neutral line. Flares have been classified accord- ing to their area in hydrogen-alpha light, with an impor- tance ranging from 1 to 4 that corresponds to an area from 2 to more than 25 square degrees. Since flares reach temperatures of tens of millions of degrees, they emit the bulk of their energy at X-ray wave- lengths of about 0.1 nm. A large flare can briefly outshine the Sun in X-rays. The X-ray radiation of flares is emitted as Bremsstrahlung ( see FREE – FREE TRANSITION ). Hard X- rays (in the region 10–100 keV) are emitted during the impulsive onset of a solar flare, while soft X-rays (1–10 keV) gradually build up in strength and peak a few minutes after the impulsive emission. During the impul- sive phase, high-speed electrons are accelerated to ener- g ies of 10 to 100 keV and hurled down the magnetic conduit of coronal loops into the dense chromosphere, where they create double, hard X-ray sources. Plasma heated to temperatures as high as 40 million K then expands upwards, by a process known as chromospheric evaporation, into the low corona along magnetic field loops that shine brightly in soft X-rays. Because solar X-rays are totally absorbed in the Earth’s atmosphere, X-ray flares must be observed from spacecraft. Flares can be characterized by their bright- ness in soft X-rays, as observed by monitoring satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). The classification shown here pro- vides a good indication of the energy output and likely terrestrial effects of a flare. Solar flares beam energetic charged particles along a narrow trajectory that follows the spiral shape of the interplanetary magnetic field in the SOLAR WIND . If a flare occurs in just the right place, west of the central meridian and near the solar equator, the accelerated par- ticles can follow the field to Earth, threatening astronauts and satellites. The time taken for particles to reach Earth depends on their energy, taking roughly an hour for a particle energy of 10 MeV. RADIO WAVES from flares are valuable for studying their physical properties. Flares can outshine the entire Sun at radio wavelengths. There are two main types of metre-wavelength radio flares, designated as type II and type III radio bursts. Type II bursts are thought to be caused by shockwaves moving outwards at velocities of about 1000 km/s (600 mi/s). Type III bursts are inter- preted in terms of electron beams moving outwards through the corona at 0.05 to 0.2 times the speed of light. Type II bursts occur much more rarely than type III. The energetic electrons that produce the impulsive, flaring, hard X-ray emissions also emit synchrotron radi- at ion at microwave (centimetre) wavelengths. flare star (UV) Red dwarf star that exhibits sudden, short-duration flares with amplitudes ranging from a few tenths of a magnitude to 6–7 magnitudes at visible wa v elengths. Flare stars are of late spectral types, dKe–dMe. During flares, the stellar emission lines become enhanced and a strong blue-ultraviolet continuum appears, giving a greater amplitude in the ultraviolet. The rise time is a few seconds to a few tens of seconds, and the decline lasts a few minutes to a few tens of minutes. The initial decline is usually rapid and may be followed by a short standstill and then a quasi- exponential decay. Small precursors or pre-flares are sometimes observed and occasionally slow rising flares are also seen. The stellar flare light is seen against the relatively faint light from the normal quiescent star, which has a cool photosphere at 2800–3600 K. At maximum optical brightness the larger flares may contribute more than 10 to 100 times the total output of the whole visible stellar hemisphere. Since the photographic discovery by Ejnar HERTZSPRUNG in 1924 of DH Carinae, the first flare star, ov er 1500 have been found. Good examples of this class of object (and their apparent visual magnitudes) are UV CETI (13.0), AD Leonis (9.4), EV Lacertae (10.1), PROXIMA CENTAURI (11.0) and BY Draconis (8.2). Membership of binary star systems appears to be mod- erately common among flare stars, notably among those stars that also show activity similar to that of the BY DRA - CONIS STARS .

Modern techniques, using fast pulse-counting photometry, spectroscopy with sensitive CCD detectors, as well as satellite observations from above the Earth’s a tmosphere, have recently revealed that flare stars are amongst the most active stellar objects in our Galaxy, and that flare energies are often 1000 times their solar counterparts. In the variable-star classification, flare stars are designated ‘UV’ after UV Ceti, the prototype. Collaborative international observations are an essen- tial part of present-day flare star research, where large numbers of hours are devoted to a few selected stars, and it is necessary to collect simultaneous spectral, optical, radio and X-ray data. In the far-ultraviolet, the Interna- tional Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) satellite registered strong emission enhancements of doubly ionized magne- sium, the carbon and silicon ionic species up to CIV and SiIV and also the high-temperature nitrogen line, NV, reminiscent of the solar outer atmosphere. Furthermore, micro-flaring in a few dMe stars has been observed simultaneously in both optical spectra and in coronal X- rays, which suggests that some stars are frequently active at a timescale of a few seconds to great heights above the stellar surface. Flare stars are thought by some to be spot- ted stars with overlying active atmospheric layers that correspond to the extremely wide range of observed tem- peratures, from 3000 K in the spots, through 10,000 K to 200,000 K in the chromosphere and transition region, to more than 1 million degrees in the corona. The flare mechanism is poorly understood, although magnetic fields associated with differential stellar rotation are probably the cause. The low mass of the nearby dMe stars (many are less than 0.1 solar mass), and their rela- tively young age, means that steady thermonuclear burn- ing in the interior, which maintains normal MAIN - SEQUENCE stars with radiative cores, may not yet have established itself. Wholly convective interiors may occur in the youngest stars of the lowest mass, and flaring appears to be a consequence of these instabilities, linked with complex magnetic fields. Difficult theoretical prob- lems need to be solved as to the source and storage of energy prior to flares and their role in heating the intense stellar coronae. A related subtype of flare stars is designated UVN. These stars are closely associated with nebulosity and are somewhat similar to the Orion variables, RW A URIGAE and TTA URI -type stars found in the region of the ORION NEBULA , the PLEIADES and most young galactic clusters (age a few million years and less). UVN stars abound in regions rich in dust and gas where star formation is still in progress. Because they are generally very faint (appar- ent visual magnitude 12 to 20), these flare stars have almost invariably been discovered with large Schmidt telescopes, and those known today required several thou- sand hours of patient observations and searching of pho- tographic plates. Flares of amplitude 4–6 mags. in the ultraviolet are fairly common among the fainter of these stars. There are more than 400 such flare stars in and around the Orion Nebula and approximately the same number in the Pleiades. Flares have also been observed in Praesepe, the Hyades, and the Cygnus and Taurus dark clouds. These abundant objects occur at earlier spectral types (dK0 to dM6) than other flare stars and w ere consequently differentiated by the name ‘flash stars’. Although little is known about these stars, there is good evidence that flares occur in quite a variety of objects, including, for example, the more massive RS CANUM VENATICORUM STARS , which are binaries with G- or K-type subgiant components. flash spectrum Emission spectrum of the solar CHROMOSPHERE briefly seen during a total solar eclipse at the beginning and end of totality. It flashes into view for only a few seconds when the Moon completely covers the PHOTOSPHERE . The lines of the flash spectrum correspond to those seen as dark FRAUNHOFER LINES in the spectrum of the bright photosphere. Fleming, Williamina Paton (1857–1911) Scottish- born astronomer who worked at Harvard College Observatory where, despite her lack of a formal higher education in astronomy, she developed a comprehensive system for classifying stellar spectra. Fleming and her husband emigrated to the USA in 1878, but he soon abandoned her, leaving her pregnant and destitute. Edward C. PICKERING , director of Harvard College Observatory, originally hired Fleming in 1881 as his housekeeper. Pickering, dissatisfied with the quality of w ork of his male assistants, complained that his maid could do a better job, and paid her as a temporary ‘computer’ at the observatory. He had just embarked on a major project to obtain large numbers of stellar spectra using an OBJECTIVE PRISM , and required a new system of classifying the many spectra that were being recorded. Fleming’s astronomical computing work was of such high quality that Pickering quickly gave her a permanent position. When she developed her own scheme for classi- fying stars according to their different spectra, he placed her in charge of the project, the outcome of which was the HENRY DRAPER CATALOGUE . She supervised many other female computers, using the ‘Pickering–Fleming’ alpha- betical classification scheme (later refined by Annie Jump CANNON ) to catalogue the spectra of 10,351 stars, pub- lished in 1890 as the Draper Catalogue of Stellar Spectra . During this time, she developed the first rigorous stan- dards for measuring the photographic magnitudes of vari- able stars. In 1898 Fleming took charge of Harvard’s rapidly growing collection of photographic plates, which she examined to discover 59 new nebulae, 222 variable stars and 10 novae – a major accomplishment, given that only 28 novae were known at the time.

Emission lines result from transitions of an atom from a high energy level to a lower level (as a result of collisions or radiative decay from a yet-higher level), resulting in the emission of photons with characteristic energies or wave- lengths. Transition probabilities depend on how the indi- vidual quantum states interact with each other. Under simplified mathematical treatment, only transitions between certain kinds of states are allowed, while others are strictly forbidden. Under more detailed calculations, the ‘forbidden lines’ are in fact allowed, but are millions if not billions of times less probable. Within gaseous nebulae and the solar corona, the states responsible for forbidden lines are populated by elec- tron–ion collisions, which establish an equilibrium among the relevant states. The production rate of forbidden line photons depends on the instantaneous level populations multiplied by the decay probabilities. Given low density and enough mass (far more than can exist in the laborato- r y), forbidden line intensities can be very high, higher even than RECOMBINATION line intensities. F orbidden lines are indicated by square brackets. The first found in gaseous nebulae were the 495.9 and 500.7 nm [O III] lines, which were eventually ascribed to the element NEBULIUM , while the first found in the solar corona, the 530.3 nm [Fe XIV] line, was assigned to CORO - NIUM ; neither element exists. Analysis of forbidden lines in gaseous nebulae is crucial to the determination of electron temperatures, densities and chemical compositions. Forbush decrease Reduction of the flux of high energy, extrasolar COSMIC RAYS observed at the surface of the Earth during high activity on the Sun. It occurs because solar activity produces enhancements in the magnetic field and plasma density around Earth, serving to scatter incoming cosmic rays. Such events thus occur more frequently at sunspot maximum. These events are named after Scott Forbush (1904–84), who first noted them in 1954. fork mounting T ype of EQUATORIAL MOUNTING in which the telescope is held between two arms parallel to the polar axis.

Its actual diameter is 120 l.y. 47 Tucanae is found 2º.5 west of the Small Magellanic Cloud (RA 07 h 24 m .1 dec. \u0004 72º05 \u0003 ) but is some 15 times closer. Spectral analysis of its stars suggests 47 Tucanae to be younger than most other globular clusters. forward scattering Reflection of light back towards the direction of the light source by an angle less than or equal to 90º. Light may be scattered from its direction of travel by fine particles of matter, either gas or dust. For particles significantly larger than the wavelength of the incident light, reflection or BACKSCATTERING of the light occurs. Foucault, (Jean Bernard) Léon (1819–68) French physicist who in 1851 used a long pendulum of his own design to demonstrate the Earth’s rotation. A FOUCAULT PENDULUM precesses in a clockwise direction with an angular speed equal to \u0005 sin \u0006 , where \u0005 is the angular speed of the Earth’s rotation and \u0006 is the observer’s latitude. Working at Paris Observatory, Foucault invented the F oucault knife-edge test for mirrors and lenses, and silver coatings for mirrors. He was the first to photograph the Sun, and he invented the HELIOSTAT . He also devised an accurate method for measuring the speed of light. Foucault pendulum Device to show that the Earth is truly rotating in space. Léon FOUCAULT noticed that a pendulum in the form of a weight suspended on a wire continued to swing in the same plane while its support w as rotated. In 1851 he set up a 67-m (220-ft) pendulum in the Paris Pantheon, the swing of which moved clockwise by about 2 mm between each complete back and forth movement. This apparent rotation of the pendulum is actually due to the Earth rotating beneath the pendulum while the latter, through inertia, maintains its orientation in space. fourth contact (last contact) In a SOLAR ECLIPSE , moment when the trailing limb of the Moon exits the F focal length 146 FORNAX ( GEN .

Fowler, William Alfred (1911–95) American astrophysicist who explained the thermonuclear reactions that take place inside stars, and calculated their rates. He spent his entire career (1933–95) at the California Institute of Technology and its Kellogg Radiation Laboratory, where the staff made many fundamental discoveries in nuclear physics by accelerating positive ions to high velocities to produce neutrons, positrons and gamma rays by bombardment. These experiments enabled Fowler to make the first measurement (in 1934 while he was still a graduate student) of the reactions involved in the CARBON – NITROGEN – OXYGEN CYCLE in stars – he detected gamma rays emitted when carbon nuclei bombarded with protons captured one of the protons to make 13 N, which itself emitted a positron. Within two years, Fowler’s group had discovered many more examples of these ‘radiative captures’, which proved to be of fundamental importance in understanding the energy processes of stars. In 1939 Hans BETHE and Carl von WEIZSÄCKER independently demonstrated how the carbon and nitrogen isotopes identified by Fowler and his colleagues were involved in converting hydrogen into helium inside stars. After World War II, Fowler resumed his investigations of the thermonuclear power sources of the Sun and simi- lar stars, developing experimental proof of the chain reac- tions that produce the ‘heavy elements’ (beyond helium). In 1957 Fowler co-authored, with Margaret and Geoffrey BURBIDGE and Fred HOYLE , the seminal paper ‘Synthesis of the elements in stars’, published in Reviews of Modern Physics and dubbed ‘B 2 FH’ after its authors, which set forth the basic mechanisms by which stars synthesize chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. In the 1960s and 1970s, Fowler’s research interests included the synthesis of hydrogen, deuterium and helium in the ‘hot’ Big Bang, massive stars and supernovae, solar neu- trinos, quasars and cosmology. He was awarded the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics for his measurements of the ther- monuclear rates in stars. Fracastorius Lunar crater (21ºS 33ºE), 97 km (60 mi) in diameter. Fracastorius is flooded with the lavas that flooded the Nectaris Basin and only the highest parts of the northern wall are still visible. The floor is smooth from the lava resurfacing, but the highest part of the central peak is still visible. A long shallow rille nearly bisects Fracastorius. The walls are deeply incised by later impacts, revealing this crater’s great age. fractional method Wa y of visually estimating the magnitude of a VARIABLE STAR . It consists of estimating the brightness of the variable as a fraction of the interval between two comparison stars (A and B, say). If it were judged to be exactly midway between them, the estimate is written as A(1)V(1)B; if it is one quarter of the way from A (the brighter) to B (the fainter), and hence three- quarters of the way from B to A, the estimate is recorded as A(1)V(3)B. The magnitude may subsequently be calculated from the known magnitudes of the comparisons. The method has the advantage that the magnitudes of the comparisons need not be known in advance, but it is best suited to sequences that have comparisons at approximately 0.5 mag. intervals, because for physiological and psychological reasons, magnitude intervals (however great) cannot be subdivided beyond a ratio of approximately 1:4 or 1:5. frame of reference Position against which measurements can be made. It is usually advisable to use a non-accelerated or inertial frame of reference when making measurements. The laws of physics can be simpler in certain frames of reference as compared with other frames, so the choice of the reference frame contributes dramatically to the ease with which equations can be solved. Franklin-Adams charts First wide-field photographic SURVEY of the complete sky, accomplished by John Franklin-Adams (1843–1912) using a specially constructed wide-field 250-mm (10-in.) refractor known as the Franklin-Adams camera . The survey, published in 1913–14 as Photographic Chart of the Sky , consists of 206 plates of about 15º \u0001 15º each, taken between 1903 and 1912 from Godalming, England, and Johannesburg, South Africa. With a limiting magnitude of around 16, these charts represent an historical record that is still used for studies of long-period variables. Fraunhofer, Joseph von (1787–1826) Bavarian optician and pioneer of solar spectroscopy. In 1806 he joined the Munich optical firm of Reichenbach, Utzschneider u. Leibherr and began to make achromatic objectives for surveying instruments, improving the methods for polishing and grinding them. His work was of such high quality that by 1809 Joseph von Utzschneider (d.1839) had placed him in charge of the firm’s glass-making facility at Benediktbeuern. There, Fraunhofer began detailed investigations of the optical properties of different kinds of glass, commencing a lifelong search for the perfectly achromatic lens. His methods of glass- and lens-making allowed his firm to produce superb refracting telescopes of greater apertures than had previously been feasible. Among them were the Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) 240-mm (9 \u0001 \u0002 -in.) refractor used by Wilhelm von STRUVE to discover many double stars, and the Königsberg 158- mm (6 \u0003\u0002 -in.) heliometer with which Friedrich Wilhelm BESSEL measured the first stellar parallax . Fraunhofer also constructed one of the earliest examples of the ‘German’ EQUATORIAL MOUNTING . In 1814–15, while studying the refractive indices of various types of glass, Fraunhofer examined the solar spectrum produced by a narrow slot placed in front of a low-power telescope, searching for the pair of bright orange-yellow lines of sodium he had already observed in F Fraunhofer, Joseph von 147 \u0001 Forty-seven Tucanae The splendidly rich, bright southern globular cluster 47 Tucanae is surpassed only by Omega Centauri. 47 Tucanae is readily visible to the naked eye.

Instead of bright emission lines, he saw dark absorption lines at the same place in the solar spectrum. William Hyde W OLLASTON had first observed these dark features in 1802, but because Fraunhofer stud- ied them in much greater detail they came to be called FRAUNHOFER LINES . This discovery led to the develop- ment of astronomical SPECTROSCOPY . To further these researches, Fraunhofer designed a dividing engine to manufacture diffraction gratings with 4000 parallel lines per centimetre, which he used to measure the wavelengths of over 500 different solar spectral features. He found that the most prominent lines are produced by atoms and ions of calcium, hydrogen, sodium, magnesium and iron. Fraunhofer lines ABSORPTION LINES in the SPECTRUM , first noted and catalogued in sunlight by Joseph von FRAUNHOFER in the early 19th century. Lettered from A to K, the Fraunhofer lines are the strongest in the solar spectrum, and are prominent in the spectra of other stars. In spite of possible confusion with chemical symbols, the various Fraunhofer designations are still in common use, particularly ‘D’ for neutral sodium at 589.6 and 589.0 nm (D1 and D2, respectively), ‘G’ for a band of CH (carbon and hydrogen, chemically bound, plus other absorptions) at 430.0 nm, and ‘H’ and ‘K’ for ionized cal- cium at 396.8 and 393.4 nm. Small ‘g’ and ‘D3’ were added later to indicate neutral calcium at 422.7 nm and neutral helium at 587.6 nm. Fred L. Whipple Observatory (FLWO) Largest facility of the SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY , situated on Mount Hopkins near Amado, 60 km (35 mi) south of Tucson, Arizona; it has been in operation since 1968. The FLWO is home to the MMT OBSERVATORY , whose 6.5-m (256-in.) telescope occupies the highest point on the site at an elevation of 2600 m (8550 ft). Other instruments are 1.5-m (60-in.) and 1.2-m (48-in.) reflectors and a 10-m (33-ft) gamma-ray telescope. The 1.3-m (51-in.) infrared telescope of the TWO MICRON ALL SKY SURVEY (2MASS) is also located on Mount Hopkins. free–free transition Radiation emitted when a free electron is decelerated in the vicinity of an ion without being captured. It is also known as Bremsstrahlung (‘braking radiation’). Friedman, Herbert (1916–2000) American astrophysi- cist who helped to found X-ray astronomy, using rocket- borne detectors to demonstrate the existence of extraterrestrial X-ray sources. After carrying out impor- tant studies of the Sun’s X-ray emissions in the 1940s and 1950s, in 1964 Friedman discovered the first X-ray source outside the Solar System, finding that the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant, is a powerful X-ray emitter. Friedmann, Aleksandr Aleksandrovich (1888–1925) Russian mathematician who in 1922 worked out the basic details of the expanding universe. He solved Einstein’s field equations for the general theory of relativity, obtaining several solutions all suggesting a universe that was isotropic, or uniform in all directions, but was not static. This set of models is known collectively as the FRIEDMANN UNIVERSE . Friedmann’s work was not influential at the time, and it remained unknown to Edwin HUBBLE . Friedmann universe Cosmological model developed by Aleksandr FRIEDMANN and others, based on Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY . It described a universe that is homogeneous and isotropic. Specifically, mass and energy are evenly distributed at the largest of scales. F ollowing these assumptions, the FIELD EQUATIONS can be solved for the entire universe. This type of universe provides the basis for modern-day BIG BANG models. frequency Number of oscillations of a vibrating system per unit of time. The normal symbol is f or v , and the units are hertz (Hz). For an electromagnetic wave, the frequency is the number of wave crests passing a given point per unit time.

The F ring has a narrow, ‘braided’ structure, governed by the gravitational influence of small satellites orbiting close to it. It lies 140,200 km (87,100 mi) from the planet’s centre. fringes Pa tterns of light and dark produced by the INTERFERENCE of light waves that are alternately in and out of phase with each other. A simple example can be produced by placing a convex lens on a sheet of plane glass. Interference fringes in the form of rings will be seen around the point of contact. Fringes provide the optical engineer with a very powerful tool for measuring the quality of optical surfaces because minor variations can cause large changes in the shape or position of fringes. F star Any member of a class of yellow-white stars, the spectra of which are characterized by weakened, though still strong, hydrogen lines, strong ionized calcium (Fraunhofer H and K), and other ionized metal lines. MAIN - SEQUENCE dwarfs range from 6000 K at F9 to 7000 K at F0, with zero-age masses from 1.05 to 1.6 solar masses, zero-age luminosities from just above solar to 5 solar, and dwarf lifetimes from just under 10 billion to 2.5 billion years. Evolved F dwarfs can have masses up to twice that of the Sun. Class F GIANTS and SUPERGIANTS (which can have much higher masses) are distinguished by the ratios of the strengths of ionized to neutral metal absorptions. F SUBDWARFS have weakened metal lines, lower metal abundances, and appear hotter than they really are. Chemically peculiar AM STARS and AP STARS run into class F, where they are known as ‘Fm’ and ‘Fp’. Class F stars are distinguished by fundamental changes in stellar behaviour. Envelope convection dimin- ishes with increasing mass and disappears near F0, where the carbon cycle begins to dominate the proton–proton chain. Rotation speeds increase as the convection layer and the associated magnetic braking die aw ay . The Sun spins at only 2 km/s (1.2 mi/s), but by F5 the typical speed is more like 30 km/s (19 mi/s), and at F0 it has climbed to 100 km/s (62 mi/s), although some stars of course still rotate slowly). Class F is the great bastion of the CEPHEID VARIABLES , which occupy an INSTABILITY STRIP in the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram extending from super- g iants in class G down through F supergiants and giants. Where the strip cuts across the Population II horizontal branch, the RR LYRAE STARS of classes F and A are found. Population II Cepheids ( W VIRGINIS STARS ) are also F bright giants. Bright examples of F stars include Porrima ( \u0001 Virginis) F0 V, Procyon F5 IV, Canopus F0 II and Polaris F5 Ia. full moon See PHASES OF THE MOON fundamental catalogue Catalogue of FUNDAMENTAL STARS whose positions and proper motions are accurately known and against which the relative position of other celestial objects may be measured.

The FK6 will be the catalogue with the most accurate proper motions yet published. fundamental forces In all of physics, every particle discovered and every interaction observed can be explained by the existence of just four fundamental forces of nature. These forces are the electromagnetic force, the gr a vitational force, the strong force and the w eak force. The electromagnetic force and the gr a vitational force are most evident in our everyday lives since they describe chemical reactions, light and the Earth’s gravitational field. It first seemed that electrical forces and magnetic forces were separate and independent, but investigations into each phenomenon led to underlying similarities. J ames Clerk MAXWELL finally combined the forces and wrote down his famous equations, which described all electrical and magnetic phenomena and explained how magnetic fields could be generated by electrical currents and vice versa. This system of differential equations also yielded a wave solution, and the wave propagated at the speed of light. Thus light was finally understood in terms of electric and magnetic fluctuations that needed no medi- um through which to propagate. Both the electromagnetic force and the gravitational force are inverse square forces in the sense that the strength of the field declines with the inverse square of the distance, and both forces have infinite range. A major difference between the electromagnetic force and the gravitational force is that the former is easily quantized, with the exchange particle being the photon. Gravity on the other hand has defied quantification, and the most successful gr a vitational theory to date is Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY , which is a CONTINUUM theory. Attempts have been made to quantize gravity but with little success; a pro- posed particle of gravitational quanta is called the graviton. The strong force and weak force are both very strong forces, but have extremely limited range. The strong force operates inside the atomic nucleus and essentially holds the protons and neutrons together by the exchange of par- ticles called gluons. The actual exchange of gluons is between the quarks that make up protons and neutrons. The strong force is the strongest of the four fundamental forces, but its range is limited to distances of the order of 10 \u0001 15 m. The weak force also operates inside the nucleus and is important in radioactive decays. The intermediate v ector boson is the exchange particle and its range is con- fined to a distance of the order of 10 \u0001 16 m. Although the strong and weak force are relatively strong compared with the gravitational force, their limit- ed range makes them unimportant in cosmological con- cerns, except close to the beginning of the Big Bang. The electromagnetic force is much stronger than the gr a vitational force, but since it comes with roughly equal numbers of opposite charges which neutralize each other, on cosmological scales it is less important than gr a vity. Thus the weakest of the four fundamental forces dominates the evolution of the universe. All of the forces except for gravity are easily under- stood within the framework of QU ANTUM THEORY . This fundamental difference between gravity and the other forces comes into play in the early universe. It is thought that under the hot and dense conditions of the early uni- ve r se the electromagnetic force and the weak force com- bined into one force. Some time later this super-force then combined with the strong force. At very early times, shortly after the Big Bang, gravity must have joined and become one with the strong electroweak force. However, o wing to the nature of general relativity, no QU ANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY has been found, and the mathemat- ics describing the fundamental forces disallows this uni- fication. The unification of the four fundamental forces of physics is the ultimate goal of physics ( see THEORY OF EVERYTHING ). Even Einstein spent some time working on the problem to no avail. Recent ideas such as SUPER - STRING theory claim to have accomplished unification, b ut at a price of postulating many unobserved dimen- sions of our Universe. fundamental stars Reference stars whose positions and proper motions have been observed and established over a long period of time to a high degree of accuracy. A measurement of the position of a star (that is, its RIGHT ASCENSION and DECLINATION ) is defined as being ‘absolute’ if it does not make use of the already known positions of other stars. Absolute positions are obtained from specialist instruments such as the CARLSBERG MERIDIAN TELESCOPE and the HIPPARCOS astrometric satellite. The coordinates and proper motions of fundamental reference stars, selected by the International Astronomical Union, are contained in a FUNDAMENTAL CATALOGUE . The system of fundamental stars provides the best available approximation to an inertial frame of reference, relative to which positions of all other celestial objects can be measured. FU Orionis star (FU, fuor) Young star that increases in brightness by some 5–6 mag. over a period of months, following which it may remain in a permanent bright state or suffer a slight decline. Objects in this small g roup are believed to represent one of the evolutionary stages exhibited by young TTA URI STARS . All known examples (about 10 in number) are associated with cometary nebulae. FUSE See FA RU L TRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER fusion, nuclear Process in which two light atomic nuclei join together to form the nucleus of a heavier a tom. In the very high temperatures found in the core of the Sun (about 15.6 million K) two hydrogen nuclei are fused together to give a deuterium nucleus, plus a positron and a neutrino. Later stages in this fusion process eventually produce the nucleus of helium. Such processes are called NUCLEAR REACTIONS . With light elements, the BINDING ENERGY per nucleon increases during nuclear fusion and so vast amounts of energy are released. The fusion of elements up to the iron-peak results in the production of energy. The fusion of nuclei heavier than iron requires there to be an input of energy to keep the reaction going, and thus mainly occurs during SUPERNOVA explosions. Fusion is the energy- producing process in most stars. The formation of elements up to iron by fusion is called NUCLEOSYNTHESIS .

It is located in Sagittarius, about 4º west of \u0001 Sgr (RA 17 h 45 m .6 dec. \u0002 29º00 \u0003 ). Its distance is about 26,000 l.y.

X-ray, infrared and radio observations show a complex structure. A radio source, SAGITTARIUS A *, right at the centre, is thought to be a BLACK HOLE with a mass of about 2.5 million solar masses. Surrounding that black hole, and within a few light-years of it, are a dense star cluster, an irregular ring of molecular gas, a gas-free cavity and mini spiral arms. The interactions between these objects are complex and not yet fully understood. galactic cluster Old term for an OPEN CLUSTER of stars. galactic coordinates System used in the study of the distribution of objects in the Milky Way galaxy, using the plane of the Galaxy and the galactic centre as its reference points and the measures of galactic latitude and galactic longitude. Galactic latitude is measured from 0º at the galactic equator to \u0004 90º at the north galactic pole, while galactic longitude is measured from 0º at the galactic centre (RA 17 h 46 m , dec. \u0002 28º56 \u0003 ), eastwards to 360º along the galactic equator.

It appears to act as an interior SHEPHERD MOON to the planet’s Adams Ring, and it orbits just beyond the exterior edges of the Lassell and Arago rings. galaxies, classification System of grouping similar GALAXIES together based on the properties of the galaxies’ structure. One widely used system is the HUBBLE CLASSIFICATION . galaxy Huge, gravitationally bound, assemblage of stars, gas, dusta and DARK MATTER , an example of which is our own GALAXY . Such objects span a wide range of size, luminosity and mass, with the largest CD GALAXIES being a million times brighter than the faintest known DW ARF GALAXIES . The forms of most galaxies fall into the three main types recognized in the HUBBLE CLASSIFICATION scheme. ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES have smooth, elliptically symmetric brightness distributions, and generally have little or no ongoing star formation or cold interstellar gas. SPIRAL GALAXIES may be ordinary or barred; they include central bulges much like embedded elliptical galaxies, surrounded by thin disks that contain cold, dense gas and have hosted star formation over most of the galaxy’s history. IRREGULAR GALAXIES have no distinct structure, are generally quite gas-rich, and form stars at a brisk rate. There are also transition S0 (or LENTICULAR ) galaxies, which share the bulge and disk structure of spiral galaxies with the old stellar populations of ellipticals. A defining property of galaxies seems to be that their internal motions suggest the presence of much more mass, in a more extended distribution, than can be accounted for by all the material that can be directly detected. This mate- rial is known as dark matter. Unless there are major modifi- cations to the properties of gravity as we understand them, this enigmatic material makes up 90% of the mass in typi- cal galaxies. The visible (and otherwise detectable) compo- nents of galaxies are such minor contributors by mass that the behaviour of dark matter must set the terms for forma- tion of galaxies and the relations among size and mass. Most galaxies collapsed to approximately their present forms and began star formation during a fairly brief epoch in the early Universe. Detailed study of nearby galaxies has suggested a picture in which an enormous gas cloud col- lapsed from a roughly spherical shape while forming stars, with remaining gas forming the thin disk of spirals in which subsequent star formation has taken place. This monolith- ic collapse (‘top down’) picture explains some aspects of galaxy structure well, but other aspects require a hierarchi- cal buildup (‘bottom up’) of galaxies from smaller units (which can be seen today as CANNIBALISM ). Galaxy evolu- tion can be observed in several guises. Interactions and mergers can trigger bursts of star formation, resulting in winds that can sweep a galaxy free of gas, and sometimes leave one galaxy in place of two. Tidal encounters may also trigger ACTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI , particularly QU ASARS . Many galaxies belong to groups or GALAXY CLUSTERS . Rich clusters today contain almost exclusively elliptical and lenticular galaxies, while such clusters at significant redshifts (seen as they were several thousand million years ago) can be rich in spirals. This shift, the Butcher–Oemler effect, shows that the cluster environment can drive galaxy evolution. Tidal encounters or interactions with the hot intracluster medium may be responsible for this change.

Seen from the southern hemisphere the Milky Way is far brighter and more spectacular. From Puppis it flows into Carina, where it is richly textured and bright enough to be seen from within large cities. Continuing bright, it sw eeps past the stars of Crux, where an intervening cloud of dusty gas has removed a black scoop from it, the COALSACK . From there a narrow dark streak bisects the Milky Way as it passes through Centaurus, swells and brightens through the tail of Scorpius, and enters Sagittar- ius. When seen against a dark sky, and when it rides near- ly overhead, the Milky Way in Sagittarius reaches its widest, at more than 30 ̊ in breadth, still split by a dark central band. That band continues as the Milky Way nar- rows northwards through Aquila to Cygnus. Northern hemisphere dwellers have termed this dark band the CYGNUS RIFT , but its full extent, one-third of the entire sky, can be appreciated only from the south. The fact that the Milky Way completely circles the sky clearly indicates that we live within it. It is our Galaxy. External galaxies basically have three forms – spiral, elliptical and irregular. The Milky Way is quite symmetri- cal about the constellation Sagittarius, so it is not irregular. Elliptical galaxies are almost spherical blobs of stars, so if we lived inside one we would see its constituent stars in every direction. Instead, the narrowness of the band of the Milky Way shows that our Galaxy is basically flat, and as such it must be a spiral galaxy. When viewed from the southern hemisphere, a spiral classification is readily appreciated. Our Solar System lies among the spiral arms, so that at least one wraps round out- side us like a cloak, while others curl between the centre and us. And, like other spiral galaxies, our Galaxy contains bands of opaque dust clouds along the spiral arms and a central bulge like a miniature elliptical galaxy within the orbit of the arms. That bulge is in Sagittarius, which is why the Milky Way widens there. In front of the bulge passes a prominent spiral arm, which produces the great brightness of the Centaurus–Crux–Carina region. This arm curls aw ay from us in Carina, where, seen effectively end-on, a g reat accumulation of stars and nebulae causes the extreme brightness and complexity. Immediately outside this arm, and therefore superimposed in front as we view it, is the band of gas and dust, a region where stars have yet to form, that causes the dark rift from Cygnus to Crux. Beyond Carina we see the fainter arm that wraps itself round out- side the Sun. It crosses the northern sky, gaining brightness as we follow it gradually inwards towards Cygnus. Although the trained eye easily sees these features, it took a long time for the Galaxy’s structure to be deduced. Even today, the details remain contentious, for instance of how many spiral arms it has. RADIO ASTRONOMY has been of paramount importance. In 1931 Karl JANSKY discovered radio emission from Sagittarius, and before long the first maps of the radio sky were made. Apart from a few indi- vidual spots of radio emission, which were later to prove of immense importance, these maps showed a band exactly following the Milky Way. The mechanisms producing visi- ble light and radio emission are grossly different, and very few objects liberate both in comparable amounts. Nonetheless, the Galaxy contains sources of both. In the northern sky the radio emission was found to be w eak, but it rose to a crescendo in Sagittarius. The differ- ence between the radio and the visible Milky Way was, quite simply, that the radio waves passed unimpeded through the dark clouds. They showed what the Galaxy w ould be like if we could see all the stars. In particular, they focused attention on the very centre of the Galaxy ( see SAGITTARIUS A and GALACTIC CENTRE ). As radio astronomy matured it began to make more sophisticated observations. One of the most important of these was the study of radiation by hydrogen atoms at a wa v elength of 21 cm ( see TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE LINE ). Observations at this wavelength could pick out the gas clouds associated with spiral arms, revealing them irrespective of whether optically opaque clouds inter- v ened. The radio astronomers put together a map of the Galaxy revealing its spiral arms. In practice the Galaxy appeared highly complex, and spiral arms could be sketched through the map only with the eye of faith. More recently, however, similar observations made from Aus- tralia, of the less ubiquitous gas carbon monoxide, have painted a much clearer canvas; this map suggests that there are four arms to our Galaxy. The best evidence now suggests that the Galaxy is a BARRED SPIRAL with a HUBBLE CLASSIFICATION of SBc. Our view from within the disk of the spiral arms can never be adequate to disentangle the full structure of the Galaxy. The following description, therefore, is based in part on studies of our own Galaxy and in part on what is known of other spiral galaxies. About 100,000 million stars populate the Galaxy, mak- ing it slightly above average in size. It is nearly 100,000 l.y. across, though its outer boundary is not well defined, and we live 26,500 l.y. from the centre. The bulge of stars in the central part comprises those that formed relatively early in the Galaxy’s history. These stars have evolved 151 G \u0001 galaxy A general outline for the structure of a spiral galaxy, of which our Milky Way is an example. Seen face-on, the galaxy has a fairly compact nucleus surrounded by an extensive disk containing star- rich spiral arms. Seen edge-on, the nucleus is revealed as a bulge, with the spiral arms confined to the flat plane of the disk. The galaxy as a whole is surrounded by a halo of globular clusters.

As a result the average colour of these stars is y ellow, and they are collectively referred to as POPULATION II stars. By contrast the disk that spreads even beyond the Sun’s orbit, and contains the spiral arms, is a site of star formation, as seen in the ORION NEBULA and similar loca- tions. The integrated light of young stars is dominated by the hottest, brightest specimens, and is therefore blue. These stars are referred to as POPULATION I stars. Inter- spersed among the stars, and especially between the curv- ing spiral arms, are dense clouds that will continue to form new stars for thousands of millions of years. Just like planets round the Sun, the stars of our Galaxy orbit the central bulge. Each star does so at a speed dic- tated by the mass of material (stars, gas and any unseen objects such as BLACK HOLES ) within its orbit. The stellar orbits are not quite circular, so stars shuffle relative to one another. In the bulge, some orbits are quite elliptical whereas others swing up and down in complex gyrations that may be visualized by drawing a sine wave around the surface of a slightly squashed cylinder. Our Sun circles the galactic centre at about 250 km/s (160 mi/s), taking some 200 million years per orbit. If the motions of the outermost stars of the Galaxy are measured, the total mass can be calculated. This measure- ment is only partially feasible, because velocities can only be determined along the line of sight (using the DOPPLER EFFECT ) and not across it. A further complication is our o wn motion, itself not very accurately known. Various sta- tistical analyses of the measured motions suggest that the Galaxy’s mass is nearly one million million times as much as the Sun, which is nearly ten times the mass of the visi- ble constituents. This extra mass forms a spheroidal halo around the Galaxy some 150,000 l.y. across, which is in turn embedded within a spherical corona, which may be up to 600,000 l.y. in diameter and which includes the MAGELLANIC CLOUDS , the GLOBULAR CLUSTERS and some other dwarf galaxies. The Milky Way may have formed the halo and corona through the accretion and tidal break- up of other small galaxies. galaxy cluster Group of GALAXIES . Galaxies are usually found as members of clusters. Rich clusters can have thousands of members and poor clusters may have only dozens of galaxies. The clustering of galaxies is an important constraint on cosmological models and the degree of clustering in the Universe today is related to the anisotropies in the matter distribution of the early universe. Margaret GELLER and colleagues at Princeton University have mapped a portion of the Universe and attempts are currently being made to characterize the degree of galaxy clustering using CORRELATION FUNCTIONS . Galilean satellites Collective term for the four largest SATELLITES of JUPITER , discovered in 1610 by GALILEO GALILEI . They were the first proof that not all motion in the Solar System is centred on the Earth, and it paved the wa y for the acceptance of the HELIOCENTRIC THEORY . Little was known about the Galilean satellites until they were seen from close range during flybys by the two VOYA GER probes in 1979. More detailed images were obtained during the 1995–2003 orbital tour by the GALILEO spacecraft, and repeated encounters cast light on their internal density distributions and detected their magnetic fields. The Galilean satellites show a progres- sive decrease in density, corresponding to an increase in the ratio of ice to rock, with distance from Jupiter. This observation reflects the higher temperatures that pre- v ailed in the inner part of Jupiter’s PROTOPLANETARY DISK while the satellites were accreting. The innermost satel- lite, IO , has the same structure as a TERRESTRIAL PLANET , with an iron-rich core surrounded by a rocky mantle. The next satellite, EUROPA , has a similar structure overlain by an outer layer of ice. GANYMEDE , the largest of the four, is composed of a roughly 40:60 ice-rock mixture, and its interior appears to be fully differentiated ( see DIF - FERENTIATION ), with an iron-rich inner core, a rocky outer core and an icy mantle. CALLISTO , the outermost Galilean satellite, is slightly less dense and appears to be only weakly differentiated. TIDAL HEATING is responsible for present day volcanic activity on Io and the recent break-up of Europa’s surface, where there may well be an ocean below the ice. It may also account for the substan- tially different evolution of Ganymede and Callisto. Galilean telescope REFRACTING TELESCOPE having a plano-convex objective and a plano-concave eyepiece. It forms an erect image and gives a small field of view. This type of instrument, first employed by GALILEO to make astronomical observations, is no longer used in astronomy, b ut the same optical system is still used in opera glasses. Galileo First spacecraft to orbit the giant planet JUPITER and to deploy an atmospheric probe into the Jovian a tmosphere, in 1995 December. It was launched by the NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRAION (NASA) in 1989 October aboard the Space Shuttle and deployed initially in Earth orbit. The launch had originally been planned for 1986 May but was delayed by safety concerns about flying Galileo with a cryogenic upper stage on the Shuttle after the Challenger accident. Soon after deployment, it was discovered that the spacecraft’s large, high-gain antenna had not deployed fully, jeopardizing the success of the mission’s ability to transmit data. Corrections to software and systems meant that the spacecraft’s loss could be compensated in part, although transmission of data took longer and contained less information. Galileo flew to Jupiter via a gravity assist flyby of Venus in 1990 February and two flybys of the Earth in 1990 December and 1992 December. The spacecraft’s path allowed it also to visit two asteroids, marking a space first in 1991 October with a flyby of GASPRA . The asteroid IDA w as explored in 1993 August. Close-up images of both asteroids at a minimum distance of 1600 km (1000 mi) and 2410 km (1500 mi) respectively were taken. In 1995 July, the atmospheric probe was deployed, some 80 million km (50 million mi) from Jupiter, and both galaxy cluster 152 G \u0001 Galilean satellites Images from the Galileo orbiter, showing the four large satellites of Jupiter, arranged in order of distance from the planet: (left to right) Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.

The probe entered the Jovian atmosphere on 1995 December 7 and transmitted data for 57 minutes during a 152-km (95-mi) descent under a single parachute, trans- mitting data to Galileo as it was preparing to enter orbit the following day. Transmission of the probe data to Earth was completed by 1996 April. The data revealed an intense radiation belt 50,000 km (31,000 mi) above the clouds, a Sun-like hydrogen–helium ratio, some organic compounds, one cloud layer and 640 m/s (2000 ft/s) winds below the cloud deck. Thunderstorms many times larger than Earth’s result from the vertical circulation of water in the top layers, leaving large areas where air descends and becomes dry and other areas where water rises to form thunderstorms. Galileo began its tour of the Jovian satellites, which continued until 2002, with a flyby of GANYMEDE , fol- lowed by several further encounters with this and the other main moons. Galileo established that the ring sys- tem is made of small grains blasted off the satellites’ sur- faces by meteoroid impacts. IO w as found to be the Solar System’s most volcanically active body, while EUROPA has a possible salty ocean containing more water than does Earth. Ganymede has a magnetic field and CALLISTO may also have a water ocean. In 2000 December, Jupiter was for the first time in space history explored by two space- craft simultaneously, with Galileo’s observations being complimented by those from CASSINI en route to Saturn during the ‘Millennium Flyby’. Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) Italian astronomer, physicist and mathematician. He was one of the first to use the telescope for astronomical observations, discovering mountains and craters on the Moon, and four satellites of Jupiter now known as the Galilean satellites. He observed the phases of Venus, and studied sunspots, from whose motion he deduced that the Sun rotates. Galileo concluded that ARISTOTLE ’s picture of the world, still widely believed in his time, was wrong and he championed COPERNICUS ’ heliocentric theory. This brought him into conflict with the Catholic Church and led to his trial and house arrest for the last eight years of his life. Born in Pisa, the son of a lawyer and musician Vincenzio Galilei, Galileo was educated at the universities of Pisa and P adua. At first he studied medicine, but abandoned it for mathematics. Early in his career, he developed the fondness of controversy that would play a major part in precipitating his condemnation in 1633. One body of opinion in the uni- ve rs ities of his day, which Galileo came first to criticize and then to openly ridicule, was the interpretation of all natural phenomena in terms of the philosophy of Aristotle, with its axiomatic assumption that the Earth stood fixed at the cen- tre of the Universe ( see GEOCENTRIC THEORY ). It is all too easy for us to sympathize with Galileo’s attacks upon Aris- totelianism, and take his polemical language at face value when he called his Aristotelian contemporaries ‘simple- tons’. Yet even by the time of his death in 1642, let alone in 1600, there was no known physical proof of the Earth’s motion in space, and Copernicus’ theory hinged more upon mathematical elegance than upon observed fact. Galileo’s youthful anti-Aristotelianism was confirmed by a series of experiments in physics. The first of these, dating from his time in Padua in 1583, made him realize that when a pendulum swings, the determining physical factor is not the heaviness of the bob, but the length of the pendulum itself. Likewise, the results of his research- es in Padua, where he became professor of mathematics in 1592, further contradicted Aristotle, for it was clear that the rate of acceleration of a falling body is governed by a fixed mathematical law that has nothing to do with the weight of the body. In Aristotle’s philosophy there w as no place for such laws. Terrestrial events were caused by an intermixing of earth, water, air and fire; only the heavens displayed mathematical regularities. Yet Galileo had shown that terrestrial as well as celestial motions conformed to exact mathematical laws, and he can be said to have established physics as a discipline founded on mathematical theory and experiment. But it was his astronomical work that made Galileo famous, to become by the end of 1610 Europe’s first scien- tific celebrity. Even before 1600, he was convinced of the truth of the heliocentric COPERNICAN SYSTEM . His convic- tion derived from Copernicanism’s mathematical elegance in explaining the retrograde motions of planets, combined with his own anti-Aristotelian conclusions in physics. But when he first used the newly invented telescope to observe the night sky over the winter of 1609/10, he saw things that he felt secured the Copernican case. He found that the Moon’s terrain was mountainous, not the smooth surface Aristotle had predicted. He also found that even under the \u0001 30 magnification of his most powerful telescope, the Milky Way fragmented into millions of individual stars, and that instead of a few thousand stars being attached to the inside of a black dome, as the ancients had taught, there seemed to be countless millions extending throughout space. And then, in 1610 January, he discovered that the classical ‘wandering star’, Jupiter, was a spherical world, with four tiny satellites orbiting it. (Simon MARIUS later claimed to have observed them first.) Very obviously, the Earth was not the only centre of rotation in the Universe. These and other telescopic discoveries by Galileo were published in 1610 March as Siderius nuncius , ‘The Starry Messenger’, and won him renown across Europe. All these discoveries, along with that of the phases of Venus (which showed that Venus revolved around the Sun) and, in 1611, of sunspots (which showed that the Sun was not an unblemished golden sphere), added to the weight of evidence against Aristotle’s ideas, yet failed to provide physical proof that the Earth was in motion. For that, a stellar parallax or some similar phenomenon was needed, and instruments would not become sufficiently accurate to measure such a parallax until 1838. Galileo’s advocacy of Copernicanism thus rested not upon being able to prove the heliocentric theory, but upon his skill in undermining the objections of conserva- tive astronomers who still adhered to Aristotle and Ptole- my . And as he could be very mocking to his opponents, Galileo made enemies, especially in the Jesuit order, whose Christoph SCHEINER had co-discovered sunspots, and yet had interpreted them in accordance with Aris- totelian criteria. In the wake of his 1610 discoveries, however, Galileo had won the patronage of the Medici family, who had invited him to their Grand Ducal Court in Florence. The now famous Galileo was elected to the prestigious Accademia dei Lincei (‘Academy of Lynx- es’) and left Padua to become a scientific courtier and holder of a research chair at Pisa. In Florence, he was 153 G \u0001 Galileo Repeated passes close to the four large satellites of Jupiter by the Galileo orbiter since 1996 have revealed these in more detail than ever before.

In 1616, however, Galileo was officially prohibited by Cardinal Bellarmine from teaching Copernicanism as the truth, as opposed to a hypothesis. Wisely, Galileo – who w as a sincerely devout Catholic – complied, but when his friend Cardinal Barbarini became Pope Urban VIII in 1623, he attempted unsuccessfully to have the 1616 prohi- bition lifted. Nonetheless, in 1632, when the Church g ranted permission for his DIALOGUES to be published, he believed that he had the right publicly to discuss Coperni- canism. However, Galileo’s ensuing condemnation in 1633 w as not for a serious heresy (the Church then had no offi- cial line for or against Copernicanism) but was discipli- nary, for breaching the prohibition of 1616. Even so, the elderly Galileo’s condemnation to house arrest at his villa at Arcetri, Florence (where he also discovered the lunar libra- tion) shocked scientists across Europe. But no further Copernicans were punished, and one wonders how far Galileo’s provocative personal style, the enemies he made in the Jesuit order, and the undoubted pride of Pope Urban VIII (who felt personally slighted by Galileo), rather than the science itself, were responsible for his fate. The Catholic Church re-opened the Galileo affair in 1822, and in 1992 Pope John Paul II proclaimed Galileo’s complete exoneration, and offered the Church’s apologies. Galileo National Telescope (TNG) In Spanish, the T elescopio Nazionale Galileo, a 3.5-m (138-in.) optical/infrared telescope completed in 1997 as an Italian national astronomy facility. It is located at the ROQUE DE LOS MUCHACHOS OBSERVATORY on the island of La Palma at an elevation of 2358 m (7740 ft). It is operated for the Consorzio Nazionale per l’Astronomia e l’Astrofisica (CNAA) by the Centro Galileo Galilei. The TNG is close- ly modelled on the ESO’s NEW TECHNOLOGY TELESCOPE . Galle, Johann Gottfried (1812–1910) German astronomer who, while at the Berlin Observatory, was the first to identify Neptune, on 1846 September 23, though others saw the planet before him but failed to recognize it as such. Galle, who was aided in his search for the new planet by Heinrich D’Arrest, used orbital calculations by Urbain LE VERRIER . He also discovered three comets and Saturn’s semi-transparent Crêpe Ring (the C Ring) (1838), though George Phillips BOND and William Rutter DA WES often receive credit for re-discovering this ring y ears later. Galle made the first reliable distance estimates for asteroids by measuring their parallaxes, first with minor planet (8) Flora in 1873 Gamma Cassiopeiae star (GCAS) Rapidly rotating V ARIABLE STAR of class Be III–V; it occasionally sheds material into surrounding space, generally from the equator, at apparently random intervals, in what are termed ‘shell episodes’.

They are related to, but less extreme than, the S DORADUS STARS . gamma-ray astronomy Research covering the energy range of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM higher than 30 keV (wavelength less than 0.04 nm), essentially the last part of the spectrum to be explored. The extreme penetration of gamma rays makes them valuable for probing regions of the Galaxy and beyond where other radiation is absorbed. COSMIC RAYS w ere first thought to be a form of gamma radiation, and many gamma rays are produced by interactions of cosmic rays with the gas in the interstellar medium. However, generally gamma rays are associated with the most energetic mechanisms in the cosmos. There are several places where gamma rays are produced: cosmic rays interacting with gas in molecular clouds; SUPERNOVA REMNANTS ,w here cosmic rays accelerated in the supernova explosion interact with nearby gas; massive stars producing gamma rays in their winds; and PULSARS . There were some early balloon experiments, but gamma-ray astronomy did not really start until 1967, with the launch of the American satellite OSO III. GAMMA - RAY BURSTS w ere first discovered around this time, by satellite- borne detectors meant to monitor violations of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. In the 1970s SAS II and COS B w ere launched and they found a few tens of sources. The subject was revolutionized with the launch of the NASA COMPTON GAMMA RAY OBSERVATORY (CGRO) in 1991, which operated until 2000. New satellites are planned – INTEGRAL is due for launch by ESA in 2002 and GLAST is due for launch by NASA in 2006. At the highest gamma ray energies (around 0.2 TeV and above), g round-based telescopes can detect CERENKOV light from the passage of gamma rays in Earth’s atmosphere. There are now several Atmospheric Cerenkov Imaging Tele- scopes (ACITs) which record the flashes (some ACITs have several dishes). Most of their results have been received in the 300 GeV to 30 TeV range. The gamma-ray view of the sky in this energy range looks rather similar to the visible picture, in that there is a general concentration of emission in the galactic plane and an increase in the general direction of the galactic centre. Galactic gamma-ray radiation will be produced mostly by cosmic rays interacting with the gas in the interstellar medium. The lower-energy gamma rays (below about 100 MeV) are produced by electrons, and the electron intensity is higher in the inner Galaxy than locally and in the outer Galaxy. However, the poor angu- lar resolution of the gamma-ray telescopes has led to many problems, particularly with the nature of the ‘hot spots’ of emission. Some of these are genuine discrete sources in that they can be identified by their time profile with pulsars, for example the CRAB PULSAR and the VELA PULSAR . The X-ray binary SS 433 was detected in gamma rays, including some spectral lines. The Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) instru- ment on CGRO found around 170 high-energy (above 100 MeV) sources in the Galaxy; the brighter sources w ere in the galactic plane, the fainter ones in the solar neighbourhood, and a large number of sources were found to lie in GOULD ’ S BELT , a series of local star-form- Galileo National Telescope 154 G \u0001 gamma-ray burst GRB 00131 was detected by several spacecraft on 2000 January 31.

Several of the sources may be older pulsars, or other types of compact objects (such as BLACK HOLES ) from past massive star formation, or massive hot stars. Gamma rays have been detected from extragalactic sources such as A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI (AGNs), quasars and BL LACERTAE OBJECTS . EGRET also discov- ered a class of objects called BLAZARS , which are quasars emitting most of their radiation in the 30 GeV to 30 MeV range, and which are variable on a timescale of days. 3C 279, at a distance of 4 billion l.y., is a blazar (but no longer regarded as typical) and in 1991 it was one of the brightest gamma-ray objects in the sky. The Imaging Compton Telescope (COMPTEL) on CGRO produced a map of the sky in the aluminium-26 line (1.809 GeV), in which the Cygnus, Vela, Carina and the inner Galaxy regions appear brightest. This radioac- tive element is produced during NUCLEOSYNTHESIS in supernovae. Another map of the sky was created in the 511 keV line, from positron–electron annihilation, which shows that this is occurring in a region around 10º in diameter centred on the galactic centre. Apart from the considerable strength, the emission is variable on the scale of a year – a possible explanation is there is a black hole at the galactic centre that somewhat irregularly con- sumes interstellar gas. gamma-ray burst (GRB) Short-duration (typically 1 to 10 seconds) outpouring of gamma rays, usually in the energy range from 100 keV to 1 MeV, from a discrete source. Some gamma-ray bursts may be shorter or longer (up to a few hundred seconds), while energies as high as the TeV range may occasionally be recorded. The optical counterparts are found to be young galaxies at high redshifts, which makes GRBs extremely energetic events. GRBs were discovered by satellite- borne detectors meant to monitor violations of the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty in 1967. In 1997 astronomers found that the GRBs are followed by an X-ray ‘afterglow’, which enabled their positions to be accurately pin-pointed. The BATSE instrument on the COMPTON GAMMA RAY OBSERVATORY (CGRO) detected 2704 GRBs using NaI detectors, sensitive to energy between 20 keV and 600 keV. In 1999 a GRB detected by CGRO was observed 22 seconds later by a ground- based robotic telescope (due to the automatic alert system), thus providing an accurate position, which meant that observations could be made in X-rays and optically with the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE , P ALOMAR and KECK . The 24th-magnitude galaxy had a peculiar shape and was very blue, suggesting that many new stars were being formed. It had a redshift of 1.6, which showed that it was around 10 billion l.y. away. It has been suggested that gamma-ray bursts occur when neutron stars collide or when there is a hypernova. Gamow, George (1904–68) Ukrainian-American nuclear physicist and cosmologist, born Georgy Anthonovich Gamov, known for his theory of the atomic nucleus, the application of nuclear physics to problems of stellar evolution, and his model of a ‘hot’ BIG BANG ; and for his later work in molecular biology. From his early w ork as a nuclear physicist in Russia, Göttingen and Copenhagen came his theory of \u0001 -decay (1928) and the ‘liquid-drop’ model of the nucleus (1931), which later proved essential for explaining nuclear fission and fusion. He emigrated to the USA in 1933, becoming professor at George Washington University (1934–56) and the University of Colorado (1956–68). Gamow solved the problem of how the relatively low collision velocities of nuclei in the interior of stars could trigger NUCLEAR REACTIONS . He showed that stars heat up as they exhaust their nuclear fuel. In World War II, he worked on the US Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. After the war, Gamow turned to the Big Bang theory. He visualized the early universe as composed of hot dense matter he called ‘ylem’, a soup of neutrons, protons, elec- trons and radiation, from which the first elements were created. With Ralph Asher Alpher (1921– ) and Hans BETHE , Gamow further developed this model, subse- quently dubbed ‘ \u0001 - \u0002 - \u0003 ’, to show that hydrogen nuclei could fuse to form helium nuclei ( \u0001 -particles) in quanti- ties that reflected the Universe’s observed helium abun- dance (1 part in 12), but that heavier elements were not produced in the Big Bang. Gamow’s greatest insight was that subsequent expansion of the universe would cool the ‘cosmic fireball’ of radiation left over from the ylem stage to about 10 K in the present. The 3 K COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND radiation discovered in 1965 by Arno PEN - ZIAS and Robert Wilson confirmed Gamow’s prediction. Ganymed P ossibly the largest near-Earth asteroid.

Ganymede’s diameter of 5262 km (3270 mi) makes it 8% larger than Mercury, but it is a mainly icy body, with a density of only 1.94 g/cm 3 , and has less than half Mercury’s mass. It has a complex, but fairly heavily cratered, icy surface, attesting to major resurfacing events in the distant past, thanks to Ganymede’s 1:2 orbital RESONANCE with EUROPA , which presumably caused TIDAL HEATING . Ganymede’s density suggests that, like CALLISTO , it consists of a 40:60 mixture of rock and ice. Its icy surface is much dirtier than Europa’s, with an albedo of only 0.45. Gravity measurements made by the GALILEO spacecraft indicate that Ganymede has undergone full DIFFERENTIA - TION , with an iron inner core (filling 22% of its radius), a rocky outer core (filling 55% of its radius) and an icy mantle. Callisto, in contrast, is only weakly differentiated. Ganymede has a magnetic field with about 1% the strength of the Earth’s; it could be generated either in the core or in a salty ocean within the ice layer. Spectroscopic studies show that Ganymede’s surface is dominantly water-ice, with scattered patches of carbon dioxide ice, and that the darkening is caused by silicate minerals (probably in the form of clay particles) and tarry molecules called tholins. There are also traces of oxygen and ozone, apparently trapped within the ice, and an extremely tenuous (and continually leaking) atmosphere of hydrogen, which is presumably the counterpart to the o xygen produced by the breakdown of water molecules. There are two distinct terrain types on Ganymede, one darker than the other. It is apparent that the pale terrain (which commonly consists of multiple sets of grooves) must be younger than the dark terrain, because belts of pale terrain can be seen to cut across pre-existing tracts of dark terrain. However, the density of impact craters on both terrain types shows that each must be very old, per- haps as much as 3 billion years. Intricate details of the grooved parts of the pale terrain hint that each belt of pale terrain might require just as complex a series of events to explain it as parts of the 155 G \u0001 Ganymede A Galileo orbiter view of Marius Regio and Nippur Sulcus on Ganymede. These alternating areas of light grooved terrain and darker cratered terrain are typical of the satellite’s surface.

On Europa there is abundant evidence for the two halves of a split tract of terrain having been moved apart to accommodate the new surface that has formed in between. On Ganymede, however, signs of lateral movement are scarce. Ganymede’s pale terrain appears to occupy sites where the older surface has been dropped down by fault movements, allowing cryovolcanic fluids to spill out ( see CRYOVOLCANISM ). It is unclear whether the grooves within each belt of pale terrain repre- sent constructional cryovolcanic features or reflect subse- quent deformation, perhaps related to underlying faults.

Garnet Star Name given by William HERSCHEL to the star \u0001 Cephei on account of its strong red colour. It is a red supergiant, spectral type M2 Ia, and a semiregular va r iable (subtype SRC), ranging between about mags. 3.5 and 5.1 every 2 years or so. It lies about 2800 l.y. away. Gascoigne, William (1612–44) English inventor of the micrometer, apparently self-taught in astronomy. Like his associates Jeremiah HORROCKS and William CRABTREE he seems to have been a Copernican. Gascoigne was the first to solve the problem of how to insert a cross-hair into the focus of a Keplerian refracting telescope so that it could be used as a sighting instrument. Around the same time ( c .1640), he invented the eyepiece micrometer, in which a precision screw was used to move two pointers in the telescope’s field of view. By enclosing the body being observed between these pointers, its angular diameter could be measured to within a few arcseconds from a knowledge of the focal length of the object glass and the pitch of the micrometer screw. Such precision measurements were crucial in quantifying changes in the lunar and solar diameters, and correlating them with Kepler’s elliptical orbits, to match theory with physical evidence. gas giant Collective term used to describe JUPITER , SATURN , URANUS and NEPTUNE , also described as the ‘jovian planets’. These planets have thick opaque a tmospheres and no solid surface visible. They are thought to contain a small solid core, with the majority of their mass made up of gas. Because of this the planets’ densities are low, indeed that of Saturn is less than that of wa ter. Uranus apart, the gas giants emit more radiation than they receive from the Sun, implying an internal heat source due in part to the effects of rotation and gravity. Saturn has long been known to have a ring system. Very much fainter ring systems have been found around the other planets since 1977. The term gas giant is also used descriptively for larger planets with similar characteristics thought to orbit around other star systems. Gaspra Inner MAIN - BELT ASTEROID and member of the FLORA family; number 951. Gaspra was encountered by the GALILEO spacecraft in 1991 October while en route to Jupiter; it was the first asteroid to be examined in this way. Gaspra is angular and thus non-spherical in shape, measuring about 18 \u0002 11 \u0002 9 km (11 \u0002 7 \u0002 6 mi). It is peppered with small craters but lacks medium to large craters, suggesting that its surface is relatively young (much younger than the Solar System). This view is supported by its planar surfaces, which may indicate where portions of the original body were sheared off by one or more major collisions some billions of years ago. Crustal cracks similar to those seen on PHOBOS are also apparent. It is believed that Gaspra is one of the daughter products of the inter-asteroid collision that produced Flora and the other members of its HIRAYAMA FAMILY . Gaspra’s spectral reflectance indicates it to be an S- class asteroid, similar in gross composition to IDA , the other asteroid examined during flyby from Galileo. Images show significant colour variations over Gaspra’s surface, with some craters and ridge tops – where the REGOLITH might be expected to be thinner or absent – appearing bluer than the surrounding areas. This va ri a tion may indicate that long term space weathering, through exposure to micrometeoroid impacts, is the cause of the redness of the surface, with the solid body of Gaspra beneath being less red. Gassendi, Pierre (1592–1655) French mathematician and astronomer. In 1631 he used the eyepiece projection method with a Galilean telescope to safely make the first observation of a transit of MERCURY across the Sun. J ohannes KEPLER , with whom Gassendi corresponded, had predicted this transit would take place, using his then-newly conceived theories of planetary motion. Gassendi Lunar crater (18ºS 40ºW), 89 km (55 mi) in diameter, with rim components up to 2700 m (9000 ft) above its floor. Gassendi has numerous rilles. Its central peaks formed from rebound of the floor after impact. Gassendi’s rim is uneven, dipping in its southern region to the point where lavas have flowed through gaps to enter the crater’s interior. Gauss, Carl Friedrich (1777–1855) German mathematician and physicist who made major contributions to celestial mechanics. He made a comprehensive study of methods of determining the orbits of planets and comets, taking into account the effects of gravitational perturbations. He then studied the theory of errors of observation, which led him to develop a technique known as the method of least squares for estimating true values from observations subject to error. In 1801 Gauss used his least-squares method successful- ly to reconstruct the orbit of the first asteroid, CERES , dis- covered by Giuseppe PIAZZI b ut subsequently lost. Piazzi obtained only three positions for Ceres, covering only a tiny 9º arc of its orbit. Gauss sent his predictions for the future positions of Ceres to Franz von ZACH , who was able to recover the asteroid on 1801 December 7. Gauss’ method of computing minor perturbations to planetary orbits was later employed by Urbain LE VERRIER and John Couch ADAMS in their computations of the orbit of Neptune. gardening 156 G \u0001 Gaspra En route to Jupiter, the Galileo spacecraft made a flyby of asteroid (951) Gaspra in 1991, revealing it to be an irregular-shaped, heavily cratered body.

GCVS Abbreviation of GENERAL CATALOGUE OF VARIABLE STARS Geller, Margaret Joan (1947– ) American astrophysicist who, working with John HUCHRA at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), has made groundbreaking surveys of galaxy redshifts to map the LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE of the Universe. The CfA Redshift Survey mapped the distribution of over 18,000 galaxies in three dimensions. The most famous map constructed by Geller’s team, which looked something like a ‘stick-man’ figure, disclosed the structure known as the GREAT WALL (1989). Geller was only the second woman to be awarded a doctorate by Princeton University. Geminga One of the most powerful gamma-ray objects in the sky, around 500 l.y. (160 pc) from Earth. It has a period of 0.237 second, so it is most likely a short- wa v elength equivalent of a PULSAR , and thus the closest pulsar to Earth. No radio waves have been detected from Geminga, so it is assumed that the JETS are not pointed at Earth. The name Geminga comes from Gemini ga mma-ray source, since the object is in the constellation Gemini, and its Italian discoverers thought it a good name since ‘geminga’ in the Milanese dialect means ‘it does not exist’. Gemini See feature article Geminids Most consistently active of the annual METEOR SHOWERS , occurring between December 7 and 16. At peak, the RADIANT lies just north of Castor, and the shower produces zenithal hourly rates (ZHR) as high as 120. The Geminids have been observed since 1838 and have become gradually more active over the years. In the 1970s, the peak was narrow with ZHR around 70; returns in the late 1990s, however, showed a much higher and broader maximum. The changing activity pattern is consistent with computer models of the METEOR STREAM , the orbit of which is being pulled closer to that of the Earth by gravitational perturbations. The models suggest that peak activity will become progressively later during the 21st century and will eventually begin to diminish in intensity. At present, the r ise to maximum is gradual, with a more rapid decline. Geminid meteors are relatively slow, with a velocity of 35 km/s (22 mi/s). A detailed analysis by G.H. Spalding (Didcot, UK) showed evidence for particle sorting in the stream, with bright events – produced by larger mete- oroids – being more numerous after Geminid maximum. Geminid meteoroids have long been known to have a higher density (2 g/cm 3 ) than those from other (cometary) sources, and they survive ABLATION down to lower altitudes in Earth’s atmosphere. This can be accounted for by their origin from asteroid (3200) PHAETHON , discovered in 1983. Asteroid and meteor stream have an unusual orbit, with a very small perihelion distance of 0.14 AU. Gemini Observatory Major international facility consist- ing of two identical 8.1-m (27-ft) optical/infrared instru- ments, the Gemini Telescopes , one at MAUNA KEA OBSERVATORY (Gemini North), dedicated in 1999 June, and the other on the 2715-m (8910-ft) high ridge of Cerro P achón in the Chilean Andes (Gemini South), which became operational in 2002 January. The seven partner countries supporting the Gemini Observatory are the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The two telescopes employ new-technology thin mirrors with A CTIVE OPTICS to provide stable images under all con- ditions of telescope attitude and wind loading. They also use state-of-the-art ADAPTIVE OPTICS to compensate for a tmospheric turbulence, yielding images of very high reso- lution. These are analysed with a comprehensive suite of optical and infrared instruments. The telescopes are partic- ularly suited to research on star formation within dust clouds and studies of the very distant Universe. As well as the telescope facilities, the observatory has a project office in Tucson, Arizona, and sea-level operations centres at Hilo, Hawaii and La Serena, 400 km (250 mi) north of Santiago in Chile. The Gemini Observatory is managed jointly by the ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES FOR RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY and the National Science Foundation.

The fundamental postulates of this new theory are: (i) SPACETIME is a four-dimensional CONTINUUM ; and (ii) the PRINCIPLE OF EQUIVALENCE of gr a vitational and inertial mass. The basis of his theory suggests that mass-energy dis- torts the fabric of spacetime in a very predictable way, and the altered paths of particles in this warped spacetime are deflected as if a force were exerted on them. Einstein needed a type of mathematics called differential geometry in order to express the relationship between mass-energy and curvature. His FIELD EQUATIONS describe the curva- ture produced in spacetime by a gravitational source. Some of the consequences of general relativity are that in strong gravity time slows down, light paths are altered by gr a vity, and gravity in strong gravitational fields no longer obeys Newton’s inverse square law. These effects are minor for most planetary orbits, but were measurable even in Einstein’s time for the orbit of Mercury. General relativ- ity has opened up new fields of astronomy such as the study of black holes, gravitational waves and cosmology. Unlike SPECIAL RELATIVITY , which is universally accepted by physicists, many were dubious of the application of dif- ferential geometry and awaited observational confirmation of this new gravitational theory. Sir Arthur EDDINGTON w as the first to measure the effects of gravity on light from distant stars during a total solar eclipse. Since then, many tests have been done and general relativity has passed every one of them. In spite of general relativity’s success, there are several competing theories of gravity that make similar but not identical predictions as Einstein’s. The major problem with general relativity is it is a con- tinuum theory and to date it has resisted quantization. A merger of the quantum theory and general relativity pre- dicts on length scales of 10 \u0002 43 m (the quantum realm), rela- tivity fails. Although some assign a classical particle called a gr a viton to general relativity, it is not compatible with cur- rent elementary particle physics. The search for a QUAN - TUM THEORY OF GRAVITY is the search for a GRAND UNIFIED THEORY (GUT) or the THEORY OF EVERYTHING (TOE).

Genesis rock Lunar rock that is notable for its high content of the mineral plagioclase; it was collected on the Apollo 15 mission. Rocks with this mineral composition are called ferroan anorthosites; they represent the mineral composition of the Moon’s early crust. gegenschein (Ger. counterglow) Faint and diffuse patch of light seen opposite the Sun in the night sky under the most transparent, moonless conditions. The gegenschein is slightly oval in shape, with its long axis extending along the ecliptic, and has a diameter of about 10º. In brightness, the gegenschein is comparable to the fainter parts of the Milky Way, and it is best seen when high in the sky. The best viewing times in the northern hemisphere are in December and January, while in the southern hemisphere the gegenschein is best seen in August (being masked by the brightness of the Milky Wa y, against which it then lies, in June and July). The gegenschein results from the scattering of sun- light by tiny dust particles in interplanetary space. Pho- topolarimetric measurements from the Pioneer and Vo y ager spacecraft indicate that the gegenschein is essentially absent beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The reflec- tive material belongs to the zodiacal dust complex. Under very clear, dark conditions, the gegenschein can be seen to be connected to the rather brighter ZODIACAL LIGHT by narrow faint extensions, known as ZODIACAL BANDS , along the ecliptic. geocentric parallax Alternative name for DIURNAL P ARALLAX . See also ANNUAL PARALLAX ; SOLAR PARALLAX geocentric theory Model of the Universe in which a stationary Earth takes central place, the world-view of many early civilizations. The Sun, Moon and planets w ere regarded as revolving around the Earth. By the 5th century BC , the Greeks were aware that the apparent motion of the Sun could be represented as the net result of a daily rotation around the Earth and a yearly journey along the ecliptic, the two motions being inclined to each other by about 24º. All motions were believed to proceed at uniform rates along perfectly uniform circles. The first theory of planetary motion was put forward by EUDOXUS , who proposed a system of 26 revolving ‘homo- centric’ (Earth-centred) spheres which carried the Sun, Moon and planets through space. By invoking contorted arrangements for the rotational axes of these spheres, many of the observed phenomena, including retrograde motions, could be reproduced. Further complexity was introduced when ARISTOTLE added even more spheres. Because the spheres are not visible, yet had to be capable of supporting the planets, they were regarded as ‘crystalline’ – invisible, or glass-like. It was Aristotle’s model, as modified by Ptolemy, that survived until the end of the Renaissance and that was defended so vigorously by the Catholic Church, largely thanks to his theory of motion, which was the nearest and most coherent approach to physics before the age of Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton. In an alternative geocentric model proposed by APOLLO - NIUS around 200 BC , the Earth remains at rest in the centre of the Universe, but the Moon, Sun and planets move in circular motion about centres displaced from the Earth. This allows to some extent for the non-uniformity of plan- etary motion. Apollonius showed that these ‘displaced’ cir- cular orbits can just as well be described in terms of motion on a circle (the epicycle) whose centre itself moves on a larger circle (the deferent), centred on the Earth.

The most primitive, least altered METEORITES are composed of minerals that contain the non-volatile elements (excluding hydrogen, helium and the noble gases) in relative proportions very similar to their abundances in the Sun, as deduced from SPECTROSCOPY . Larger bodies that formed from such material were altered to various degrees by heating and DIFFERENTIATION . The most abundant elements separated into metallic CORE and silicate MANTLE and CRUST . The less abundant elements were partitioned among them according to their chemical and thermodynamic properties. The elements classified as siderophile, lithophile or chalcophile have affinities for metallic iron, silicates and sulphides, respectively. Chemical analysis of one component of a planetary body can provide information about the rest; for example, a sample of the body’s crust can reveal much about the composition of its core. Moreover, some elements have affinities that vary with temperature, pressure and the o xidizing/reducing conditions of their surroundings; the distribution of these elements among various mineral phases in a rock reveals the conditions of its formation. A closely related discipline is COSMOCHEMISTRY , which includes the behaviour of elements in interstellar space and the SOLAR NEBULA . geodesic Shortest distance between two points, given by a straight line on a flat surface and by a great circle on a sphere. In general relativistic curved spacetime, a geodesic is the path giving smallest separation between two events ( see TIME ). The orbital motion of planets and other astronomical objects is then understood as the objects following geodesic tracks through a spacetime that has been distorted from Euclidean geometry by the presence of masses. Geographos APOLLO ASTEROID discovered in 1951; number 1620. Radar imaging has shown Geographos to have a highly elongated shape. See also table at NEAR - EARTH ASTEROID geomagnetic storm Large-scale disturbance of Earth’s MAGNETOSPHERE resulting from the arrival via the SOLAR WIND of energetic, highly magnetized plasma thrown from the Sun during CORONAL MASS EJECTION or FLARE events. The most visible effects of a geomagnetic storm take the form of enhanced auroral activity, including the spread of the AUR ORA to lower latitudes than normal. Magnetometer equipment allows detection of other effects, which can, during severe storms, be global in extent. The onset of a geomagnetic storm, as ejected solar material impacts on the magnetosphere, is detected by magnetometers as a sudden storm commencement (SSC). During the SSC, compression of the magnetos- phere produces an abrupt intensification of the ground- level magnetic field, the horizontal east–west component of which shows a rapid change in orientation. During the main phase of the storm, which can last for 24–36 hours, the magnetic field continues to fluctuate rapidly before g radually returning to normal. The fluctuations can be correlated with episodes of increased auroral activity. They result from the build-up and release of stress pro- duced as plasma from the solar wind penetrates the mag- netosphere, disturbing the resident population. Ground-level electrical currents induced by geomag- netic storms have in the past disrupted telegraph com- munications, and they can cause corrosion in high-latitude oil and gas pipelines. During the huge storm of 1989 March 13–14, these currents caused a power blackout affecting Quebec Province in Canada. Ionospheric currents pose a hazard to artificial satellites, leading to a build-up of charge which can damage elec- trical components. Satellites that have been lost following geomagnetic storms include Marecs-B (used in naviga- tion), Anik-1 and Anik-2 (telecommunications) and ASCA (astronomical research).

If this orbit is circular and in the plane of the Earth’s equator (that is, with an inclination of 0º), the satellite appears to be virtually stationary in the sky, so it is described as geostationary . A geostationary orbit is at an altitude of 35,900 km (22,380 mi) above the Earth. A satellite in a geosynchronous orbit inclined to the Earth’s equator appears to trace out a figure-of-eight shape over the course of a day. Geotail J apanese satellite launched in 1992 as part of the INTERNATIONAL SOLAR TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS programme, involving the US WIND and POLAR spacecraft and the European SOHO and CLUSTER satellites. Geotail measures global energy flow and transformation in the Earth’s magnetotail to increase understanding of the processes in the MAGNETOSPHERE . The craft used two gravity assist flybys of the Moon to enable it to explore the distant part of the magnetotail. Two years later, the orbit was reduced so that the spacecraft would study the near-Earth magnetotail processes.

Because lava above the crater’s rim remained relatively thin, the later subsidence of the lava placed stress over the rim.

Giacobinids (Draconids) Periodic METEOR SHOWER associated with Comet 21P/ GIACOBINI – ZINNER . Showers of Giacobinids have been seen only in those years when the parent comet has returned, and they have durations of a few hours. Possible low activity was seen in 1915 and 1926, with substantial displays on 1933 October 9 and 1946 October 10. During a 4 \u0001 \u0002 -hour period, the 1933 return produced Giacobinid rates of between 50 and 450 per hour. In 1946, despite strong moonlight, visual rates of about 5000 Giacobinids per hour were reported; this display was also observed using radio echo methods at J odrell Bank. Japanese observers recorded another significant outburst on 1985 October 8. Until 1998 reported Giacobinid displays had occurred when Earth followed the comet to the NODE where its orbit intersects that of the Earth; the strong display of 1998 October 8, however, with Giacobinid rates reaching 50–100 per hour, was somewhat surprising because, on this occasion, Earth crossed the node 44 days ahead of the comet, which indicated a greater spread of meteoroids in the space around the nucleus than had previously been suspected. Giacobinid meteors come from a radiant near the ‘head’ of Draco; they are notably slow, with an a tmospheric velocity of only 20 km/s (12 mi/s). Giacobini–Zinner, Comet 21P/ Short-period comet discovered by Michel Giacobini (1873–1938), Nice Observatory, France, on 1900 December 20, and re- discovered two returns later on 1913 October 13 by Ernst Zinner (1886–1970) at Remeis, Germany. The comet’s period is 6.61 years, with favourable apparitions at every second return. Comet 21P/Giacobini–Zinner has been observed at 15 returns up to 1998, with only the 1953 apparition having been missed. The comet is the parent of the GIACOBINID meteors. Comet 21P/Giacobini–Zinner became the first comet to be investigated at close range by a spacecraft: the International Comet Explorer (ICE) flew through its tail on 1985 September 11. giant impactor theory Theory that addresses the origin of the MOON . Prior to the Apollo missions, there w ere three ‘classical theories’ of lunar formation. First, the fission hypothesis, in which the Moon was ‘spun out’ from a rapidly rotating, but still molten, Earth. Secondly, the binary accretion hypothesis, in which the Earth and Moon formed as a ‘double planet’, and so remained rotating around each other. The problem with this notion is that it should produce two bodies with the same composition, which is not the case. Thirdly, the capture h ypothesis whereby the Moon was formed elsewhere in the Solar System and then captured by Earth’s gravity. The Moon is, however, so large that, with any significant difference in approach velocity, the Earth would be unable to capture it unless a highly improbable set of orbital coincidences were satisfied. After the Apollo missions returned samples of the lunar surface, the above theories were discounted. In the 1970s, a new mechanism of lunar formation was pro- posed – the giant impactor theory. In this scenario, the Earth was struck on its side by a Mars-sized planetesi- mal. This glancing blow propelled large amounts of Earth’s mantle and of the impactor into orbit. The impactor’s core later decelerated and returned to Earth, b ut the rest of the material remained in orbit, forming a transient ring. This material rapidly accumulated by impact processes into the Moon. The giant impactor theory offers an explanation for the Moon’s unique mineral composition. The Moon is depleted in iron because the Earth had already partially differentiated (the iron was in the core), and so little iron w as in the mantle’s ejecta. The high temperatures of the impact process explain the Moon’s depletion in volatiles (such as potassium and water) and its enrichment in refractory elements (such as europium). The Moon has the same isotopic compositions as Earth because much of it came from the Earth’s mantle. The giant impactor theo- ry also explains the angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system by proposing a glancing blow. Final- ly, the accumulation of orbital materials into the Moon by high temperature impact processes offers an explanation for the early Moon’s near global melting (producing a global magma ocean, which accounts for the mineralogi- cal stratification of the Moon).

The GSMT is intended to complement the AT A CAMA LARGE MILLIMETER ARRAY and the NEXT - GENERATION SPACE TELESCOPE . giant star Star with radius between 10 and 100 solar radii; it is placed well above the main sequence in the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM . Giant stars include ARCTURUS , CAPELLA and ALDEBARAN . A giant star will have a larger radius than a main-sequence star ( DW ARF STAR ) of the same temperature; however, a giant star of intermediate temperature is smaller in size than the hottest dwarf. Thus the term ‘giant’ refers to the relative luminosity of a star rather than its size. Giant stars represent late stages in STELLAR EVOLU - TION , when the stars have exhausted hydrogen in their cores and SHELL BURNING is occurring. They have dense central cores and tenuous atmospheres. RED GIANTS are normal stars that are undergoing hydrogen shell burning. Higher-mass stars can continue to burn other elements in their cores and in concentric shells in their atmosphere. As the mechanism that creates energy within a star s witches from one set of nuclear reactions to another, its radius, temperature and luminosity change. Thus giant stars move around the giant region and HORIZONTAL BRANCH of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram. Most stars pass through the INSTABILITY STRIP at some point, becoming CEPHEID VARIABLES or RR LYRAE VARIABLES . In its final phase, a giant star becomes brighter and moves to the asymptotic giant branch. Because of their high intrinsic luminosity, giants are quite common among naked-eye stars but are in fact rela- tively rare in space. gibbous phase PHASE of a planet or the Moon when between first or last quarter and full. The word gibbous means ‘bounded by convex curves’ and describes the appearance of a body when more than half but less than all of its illuminated side is visible. Gilbert, William (1540/44–1603) English doctor, the first scientist carefully to investigate magnetic phenomena, including the Earth’s magnetic field, as described in his De magnete (‘On Magnetism’, 1600). He believed the planets were held in their orbits by magnetic attraction. Gilbert was one of the first English supporters of Copernicus’ ideas, and he prepared a pre- telescopic Moon map. Gill, David (1843–1914) Scottish-born astronomer who served as the fifth director of the Cape Observatory (1879–1907). Gill’s early work involved determining the solar parallax from the 1874 and 1882 transits of Venus, and from observations of Mars and asteroids. He made the most accurate pre-photographic measurements of stellar parallaxes, computing accurate distances to 22 stars in the southern sky. His photographs of the Great Comet of 1882 showed so many stars that he proposed photography as the best method of acquiring data for star catalogues. In collaboration with the Dutch astronomer J acobus KAPTEYN , who compiled data from Gill’s photographic plates, he produced the massive CAPE PHOTOGRAPHIC DURCHMUSTERUNG , which lists the positions and magnitudes of 455,000 stars in the southern hemisphere brighter than 10th magnitude. Gill w as one of the major forces behind the all-sky photographic survey known as the CARTE DU CIEL . Giotto EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY ’s first deep-space probe and the first spacecraft to make close-range studies of two COMETS . It was named after the Italian painter Giotto di Bondone ( c .1267–1337), who depicted Halley’s Comet as the ‘Star of Bethlehem’. Giotto carried ten experiments to study all aspects of the comet and its environment. It was launched from French Guiana on 1985 July 2 by an ARIANE 1 rocket and encountered Comet HALLEY on 1986 March 14. Giotto w as peppered by 12,000 dust impacts on its approach to the nucleus. Only 15 seconds before closest approach, the spacecraft was sent spinning by an impact with a large particle. Contact was eventually restored 32 minutes later, by which time Giotto had passed the nucleus on the sun- w ard side at a distance of 596 km (370 mi). Giotto’s images revealed a black nucleus about 15 km (9 mi) long and 7–10 km (4–6 mi) wide. It was pock- marked by craters, and bright jets of material could be seen on the sunlit side. About 80% of this material was wa ter, with substantial amounts of carbon monoxide (10%), carbon dioxide (2.5%), methane and ammonia. The density of the nucleus was 0.3 g/cm 3 (one-third the density of water). Although the spacecraft and half of its experiments w ere damaged, Giotto completed the first Earth gravity assist by a spacecraft coming from deep space on 1990 July 2. It was then retargeted to encounter Comet GRIGG – SKJELLERUP on 1992 July 10. During the closest ever cometary flyby, Giotto passed by on the night side at a distance of about 200 km (125 mi). Dust caused very little damage to the space- craft, owing to its slow relative approach speed of 14 km/s (9 mi/s), compared with 68 km/s (109 mph) for Halley, and a much lower dust production rate. The experiments w ere shut down on July 11. Glenn, John Herschel (1921– ) First American to orbit the Earth, in the Mercury spacecraft named Friendship 7 , on 1962 February 20. After distinguished careers as a World War II combat pilot and a test pilot, Glenn was selected as one of the seven original Mercury astronauts in 1959, and less than three years later he completed his three orbits of the Earth in 5 hours. On 1998 October 29, Glenn returned to space for nine days aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery , becoming the oldest astronaut in history. Glenn Research Center In full, John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field, a NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) laboratory specializing in propulsion, power and communications technologies, situated next to Hopkins International Airport, Cleveland, Ohio. It was founded in 1941 as the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory, and w as later known as the Lewis Research Center. It is NASA’s lead centre for aeropropulsion and its centre of excellence in turbomachinery. It also conducts research in microgravity, fluid physics and materials science. glitch Sudden increase in the rotation rate observed in a number of younger PULSARS , such as the Crab and Vela pulsars.

The core of a globular cluster is very densely packed and cannot generally be resolved into individual member stars. Globulars range in diameter from a few tens to over 300 l.y. The Milky Way has fewer than 150 known globular clusters, but it is expected that there are about 200 in total, the others being obscured by the dust and gas in the galac- tic plane and the galactic centre. The farthest known glob- ular clusters, for example NGC 2419, lie beyond the galactic disk at distances of around 300,000 l.y. Most globular clusters in the Milky Way lie in the galactic HALO , surrounding the galactic centre; they have highly elliptical orbits of periods about a hundred million y ears or longer. The fact that they are centred on the galactic centre allowed the American astronomer Harlow SHAPLEY to estimate the distance to the galactic centre. Around 20% of globulars lie in the galactic disk and move in more circular orbits; these are known as disk globulars. Globular clusters contain a mix of stars of various sizes, all of which evolved from the same cloud of gas at the same time. As all the stars within a cluster lie at the same distance from us, the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIA - GRAM (HR diagram) can be plotted for them simply by measuring their colour and their APPARENT MAGNITUDE (brightness), knowing that there is a constant difference between the apparent and the ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE according to the cluster’s distance. It is possible to deduce the cluster’s distance by comparison with a standard HR diagram because the MAIN SEQUENCE will appear in the correct place only if the distance is right. The HR diagram of a globular cluster reveals more than its distance. As time passes, the brightest stars in a cluster exhaust their hydrogen and become RED GIANTS . This happens progressively to fainter and fainter stars. The HR diagram clearly shows which stars have begun their transformation to red giants, and thus the age of the cluster. Many globular clusters have been dated about 10 billion years old; they must have formed before the Uni- ve r se attained half its present age (s ee TURNOFF POINT ). In those remote times the chemical mix of our Galaxy w as quite distinct from that of the present. Stars, especial- ly those that turn into SUPERNOVAE , create elements such as carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron out of their hydrogen. Over the years, the proportion of these elements, which astronomers call metals, has increased, so we expect to see more metals in young stars than in the old globular clus- ters. In general, the stars within globular clusters are old, metal-poor, POPULATION II stars. Further detailed examination of galactic globular clus- ters suggests distinct subgroups: the halo globulars, fur- ther divided into ‘old halo’ and ‘young halo’ clusters; the disk globulars, which are younger and more metal-rich than halo globulars; and the bulge globulars, which lie in the more central parts of the Galaxy and are fairly metal- r ich, with almost solar-type chemical abundances. The oldest globular clusters probably formed 13 to 14 billion years ago in the initial collapse of the forming Galaxy. The younger, more metal-rich disk globulars and the bulge globulars formed significantly later. The young halo globulars, such as M54, may have formed outside the Galaxy, perhaps in nearby DW ARF GALAXIES , which were subsequently pulled into the Milky Way. M54 is believed to have belonged to the Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy, discovered in 1994, which is currently merging with the Milky Way. Another important role of the globular clusters has been to give us a means of estimating distances. Globular clusters contain a particular type of variable, the RR LYRAE STARS , the intrinsic brightnesses of which can be deter- mined. Thus, when these stars are recognized in other locations, the distances can be derived for different objects. Globular clusters can be seen around other galaxies. Some galaxies, such as M87, contain several thousand globular clusters, whereas other galaxies, like the two Magellanic Clouds and the Pinwheel Galaxy, appear to have globulars that are only a few billion years old. Recent observations of some globulars suggest star formation may be occurring within them. globule Dense compact dust and gas cloud that strongly absorbs the light from objects behind it. A globule is the smallest of the D ARK NEBULAE . There are two main types of globule – the COMETARY GLOBULE and the Bok globules. The latter are named after Bart Jan BOK , who first suggested that the globules might be the forerunners of PROTOSTARS . Bok globules are roundish dark clouds that may have diameters as small as 0.1 l.y. At such small sizes, they can only be seen when they lie in front of a bright emis- sion nebula. Larger globules are seen as dark patches against the stellar background of the Milky Way; they may have sizes of up to 3 l.y. The mass of dust in a glob- ule can be estimated from the EXTINCTION of back- g round light, but it is certain that the dust makes up only a small fraction of the total mass of a globule.

The expected main constituent, molec- ular hydrogen, is very difficult to observe, but the much less abundant molecules of carbon monoxide, formalde- hyde and the hydroxyl radical have been observed at radio wavelengths. Total estimated globule masses thus range from about 0.1 solar mass for the smallest, to about 2000 solar masses for the RHO OPHIUCHI dark cloud. There is no sharp cut-off in the mass range, so that at the larger sizes the globules simply become the smaller dark nebulae such as the COALSACK . Such a large mass of gas and dust within the small radius of a globule at a low temperature will undergo grav- itational contraction to form first protostars and then nor- mal main-sequence stars. The close positional association of globules with TTA URI STARS and HERBIG – HARO OBJECTS , both phenomena associated with star formation, tends to confirm this view. gluon Particle exchanged when two quarks interact by the strong force. The strong force is the strongest of the four FUNDAMENTAL FORCES , and the exchange of gluons between quarks holds nuclear particles such as protons and neutrons together, as well as holding them in atomic nuclei.

Goddard, Robert Hutchings (1882–1945) American astronautics pioneer, who flew the first liquid-propellant rocket, on 1926 March 16. In 1920 he set forth most of the basic principles of modern rocket propulsion. He later set up a rocket research and development test facility in the New Mexico desert, where he developed stabilizing and guidance systems, including the first rocket gyroscopes, and parachute systems that could be used to recover heavy payloads. Although Goddard’s achievements went largely unrecognized during his lifetime, German rocket scientists led by Werner von BRAUN used his designs to build the V-2 rockets that, after their capture at the end of World War II, kick- started the American space programme. Goddard Space Flight Center NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) major space science laboratory, located in Greenbelt, Maryland, near Washington D.C. Established in 1959 May, it is named in honour of the American rocket pioneer Robert GODDARD . The centre specializes in astronomy, solar–terrestrial relations, and environmental studies of, for example, the Earth’s ozone layer and global wa rming. Goddard operates its own spacecraft, and conducts research in spaceflight technology. It also houses the National Space Science Data Center and the ASTRONOMICAL DATA CENTER . Gold, Thomas (1920– ) Austrian-American cosmologist known for his advocacy of non-mainstream theories, including the steady-state cosmological model. He left Austria for England before Word War II, receiving his education at Cambridge, then moving to Greenwich (1952–56) under Martin RYLE . He emigrated to the United States in 1956, working first at Harvard, then at Cornell. With Fred HOYLE and Hermann BONDI , Gold conceived a theory of cosmology where, though the universe expands, the density of matter is kept constant by the continuous creation of new matter. Gold was the first correctly to explain that pulsars are rotating neutron stars with powerful magnetic fields. Goldberg, Leo (1913–87) American astronomer, an expert on stellar evolution, who specialized in solar astronomy and the study of stellar atmospheres and mass loss. At the University of Michigan’s McMath–Hulbert Observatory, he used a variety of imaging techniques to capture the structure and motion of solar flares and prominences.

Göttingen Observatory Scientific facility within the physics faculty of the Georg-August-Universität at Göt- tingen, 90 km (55 mi) south of Hanover. Its origins go back to 1750; construction of the present observatory (just outside the old city walls) began in 1803. Its first director, Carl Friedrich GAUSS , was appointed in 1807, and it became a major centre for astrometry. Its reputation continued into the 20th century under the directorship of Karl SCHWARZSCHILD . Today, the observatory specializes in solar physics, X-ray astrophysics, extragalactic astro- physics and instrumentation for 8-m (25-ft) class optical/infrared telescopes. Gould, Benjamin Apthorp (1824–96) American astronomer who catalogued the southern stars from the CÓRDOBA OBSERVATORY , Argentina, which he founded and directed (1870–85). He studied astronomy under Carl Friedrich Gauss at Göttingen, and on his return to America he founded the Astronomical Journal in 1849. After directing Dudley Observatory (Albany, New York) from 1856 and his own observatory at Cambridge (Massachusetts), he moved to Córdoba, where he catalogued tens of thousands of stars visible only from the southern hemisphere, publishing several catalogues (1879–96). Gould applied photography to the study of star clusters. GOULD ’ S BELT is named after him. Gould’s Belt Belt of stars and gas about 3000 l.y. across tilted to the galactic plane by about 16 ̊.

Much of Graham-Smith’s research is on pulsars, for which he conceived the relativistic beaming theory. Granat Soviet gamma-ray and X-ray spacecraft launched in 1989 December, carrying a French Sigma gamma-ray instrument, with contributions from Denmark and Bulgaria. With a spacecraft bus based on the Soviet Astron astrophysical platform, Granat had completed, within the first three years, over 700 specific observations lasting typically 24 hours at a time, some as long as 46 hours. Sigma observations in 1991 were coordinated with the newly launched NASA COMPTON GAMMA RAY OBSERVATORY . Grand Tour In the late 1960s, US planners and scientists realized that the four major outer planets – Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune – would be in an approximate alignment in the late 1970s/1980s that is repeated only once every two centuries. Ambitious plans w ere made for two gravity-assist launches to Jupiter/Saturn/Pluto in 1976–77 and similar launches to Jupiter/Uranus/Neptune in 1979, the so-called Grand T our Missions. Political and economic constraints led to a reduced two-spacecraft mission targeted to only Jupiter and Saturn. Begun in 1972 as Mariner-Jupiter-Saturn (MJS), the project’s name was changed in 1977 to VOYA GER . Voyager 2 eventually accomplished a Grand T our when its mission was extended to Uranus (in 1986) and then Neptune (in 1989). grand unified theory (GUT) Theory that attempts to ‘unify’ three of the four forces of nature, that is, to demonstrate that they are different manifestations of a single force. In descending order of strength, the four FUNDAMENTAL FORCES are: the strong nuclear interaction (which binds atomic nuclei); the electromagnetic force (which holds atoms together); the weak nuclear interaction (which controls the radioactive decay of a tomic nuclei); and gravitation. The weak and strong interactions operate over tiny distances within atomic nuclei while the other two are infinite in range. With the exception, so far, of gravita- tion, all the forces can be described by quantum field theories, which imply that forces are communicated by means of particles: the more massive the force-carrying particle, the shorter its life and the shorter the range of the force. Grand unified theories (GUTs) attempt to unify the weak, strong and electromagnetic forces. Many physicists believe that a more elaborate theory will even- tually be found which will unify all four forces. The first step towards unification was the W einberg–Salam–Glashow theory of the ‘electroweak’ force, published in 1967, which implied that at particle energies greater than about 10 12 eV, the electromagnetic and weak forces should be equal in strength and behave in the same way. The theory was confirmed in 1983 when the predicted force-carrying particles – the massive W and Z bosons – were detected. GUTs imply that at energies greater than about 10 24 eV the electroweak and strong nuclear interactions Goodricke, John 164 G \u0001 Golevka A series of radar images showing the irregular profile of near-Earth asteroid (6489) Golevka.

Such energies far exceed the capabilities of our particle accelerators, but would have existed everywhere in the Big Bang universe during the first 10 \u0001 35 seconds after the initial event. Thereafter, as the universe expanded and cooled, the unified force w ould have split into the strong force and the elec- troweak force which, in turn, split into the electromag- netic and weak forces. The simplest GUT, proposed in 1973 by Sheldon Glashow (1932– ) and Howard M. Georgi (1947– ), requires the existence of a set of supermassive ‘X-parti- cles’ that can transform quarks into leptons and vice versa. Since quarks are the basic constituents of protons, the the- ory predicts that protons themselves must eventually decay into lighter particles. The half-life of a proton is believed to be at least 10 32 y ears, but given enough pro- tons it should be possible at any time to detect the spo- radic decay of a few. Experiments are under way to test this prediction; if confirmed, it implies the eventual disin- tegration of all the familiar chemical elements.

The granulation consists of about one million bright convection cells, called granules. The bright centre of each granule indicates hot plasma rising to the photosphere, and its dark edges indicate cooled material descending towards the interior. Individual granules are often polygonal, and they appear and disappear on time scales of about ten minutes. Each granule has an average size of approximately 1000 km (600 mi). Larger convection cells, each about 30,000 km (20,000 mi) across, make up the supergranulation. graticule System of reference wires or fine lines placed in the focal plane of a TELESCOPE and used for measuring the positions and separations of celestial objects within the field of view.

The wires have to be so fine that spider threads have been utilized for this purpose in the past. See also FILAR MICROMETER grating See DIFFRACTION GRATING gravitational constant ( G ) Fundamental constant in Newton’s law of gravitation ( see GRAVITATIONAL FORCE ). Its value has been determined as G = 6.67259 \u0002 10 \u0001 11 m 3 /kg s 2 , with an uncertainty of about 0.00085 \u0002 10 \u0001 11 . gravitational force Mutual attraction between two masses; it is the fourth of the physical forces. In his Principia , NEWTON announced that the force of gravity between any two masses, m 1 and m 2 , is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, r , between them: where G is the GRAVITATIONAL CONSTANT . Thus, he was able to link the acceleration with which objects, such as the apocryphal apple, fall to the Earth’s surface with the orbital motion of the Moon. Gravity is very weak at close range, compared with electromagnetic and nuclear forces, but it becomes important on larger scales because it has a longer range than the nuclear forces and because, unlike electric charges, all mass is positive and attracts every other mass. Thus gravitation is the dominant force on large scales. F or this reason it is astronomical observations that have provided the tests of theories of gravitation, such as New- ton’s original theory, Einstein’s GENERAL RELATIVITY and the BRANS – DICKE THEORY . Astronomers often determine the masses of astronom- ical objects such as the Sun, planets, stars and galaxies from their orbital dynamics. But in fact what they actually find is the product of mass and G . The gravitational con- stant can only be determined by measuring the attraction between known masses in the laboratory. There is no way to screen out forces from masses outside the laboratory so the experimenter must measure a disturbance on the object being tested which is a tiny fraction of the Earth’s a ttraction. Thus the accuracy with which G is known is often the limiting factor in measuring the masses of stars and planets and other astronomical objects. gravitational lens Configuration of an observer, an intervening mass and a source of light in which the mass acts as a lens or imaging device for light from the distant source. GENERAL RELATIVITY predicted that a mass (star, galaxy or black hole) situated directly in front of a distant light source (galaxy or quasar) will bend the light and possibly form images of the distant source. The deflection of starlight around the Sun during a solar eclipse was the very first observational confirmation of general relativity, made in 1917 by Sir Arthur Eddington. This prediction and confirmation paved the way for more complex situations, in which light from distant galaxies and quasars might be bent enough by foreground galaxies or stars to form images. This consequence was championed by Fritz ZWICKY in 1937 and was verified in 1979 with the discovery by Dennis Walsh, Robert Carswell and Ray Weymann of the first of the known ‘double quasars’ (0957+561). Many more gravitational lens systems have now been observed, including distant galaxies and quasars lensed by nearer galaxies; these distant galaxies would not be visible –––––––– F = G m 1 m 2 r 2 165 G \u0001 granulation Under good seeing conditions, fine mottling of the Sun’s photosphere can be observed.

In this example, the quasar’s light is split into four separate images, each arriving at the telescope along a slightly different path.

Under certain conditions, a compact lens that lies directly along the line of sight forms multiple images that overlap. The resulting magnified image appears much brighter than the original source. This situation is known as microlensing . Microlensing might be impor- tant in quasars when intervening objects (stars or black holes) move across the line of sight to distant quasars and cause an increase of brightness in the quasar. These ‘microlensed’ outbursts are symmetric in time and fre- quency independent. Dark matter in our galactic halo might also ‘microlens’ stars in nearby galaxies, thus reveal- ing their presence. See also EINSTEIN RING gravitational redshift Increase in the wavelength of a photon emitted from an object within a gravitational field. The name arises because in the visible region the wa v elength shift is towards the red end of the spectrum. This is not true at longer wavelengths, so the alternative name, Einstein shift, may be preferred. The change in wa v elength is: where G is the gravitational constant, m the mass of the body, \u0001 the original wavelength, c the velocity of light, and R the distance of the emitting region from the mass. gravitational wave Pe r iodic disturbance in a gr a vitational field, which, according to EINSTEIN ’ S theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY , propagates through space at the speed of light. Any changes in a gravitational field are expected to travel at the speed of light so that, for example, if the Sun w ere to be annihilated, 8 m 18 s w ould elapse before the Earth ceased to ‘feel’ the gravitational influence of the Sun. Just as an accelerating or oscillating charged parti- cle emits electromagnetic waves, so an accelerating, oscillating, or violently-disturbed mass is expected to radiate wave-like gravitational disturbances, which are known as gravitational waves. Because gravitation is by far the weakest of the forces of nature, gravitational waves are expected to be weak and difficult to detect. The most likely sources of these waves include: rapidly spinning bodies distorted from perfect sphericity; close binary stars, particularly those involving collapsed objects like NEUTRON STARS or BLACK HOLES ; SUPERNOVAE ; and events involving massive black holes. See also GRAVITATIONAL WAVE DETECTOR gravitational wave detector Device intended for the detection of GRAVITATIONAL WAVES . A passing gr a vitational wave is expected to stretch and squeeze a solid body or to cause small displacements in the separation between two independent masses. In principle, these effects could be measured. In practice, few, if any, events are likely to produce gravitational waves causing displacements (strains) larger than 1 part in 10 19 . Two masses separated by a metre would thus be moved by an amount far smaller than an atomic nucleus. Current detectors include solid bars (cooled, to mini- mize noise) and Michelson interferometer systems. The Michelson systems attempt to measure the relative dis- placement of two or more mirrors attached to test masses, ‘freely’ suspended in a vacuum, with multiple reflections being used to increase the effective separation between the test masses. Several interferometer-based gravitational wa ve detectors are currently nearing completion and are expected to be able to detect strains of 10 \u0002 22 . So if predic- tions of the magnitudes of gravitational waves to be expected from astronomical events are correct, then these wa v es should soon be detected. gravity gradient Rate of change of the strength of a gr a vitational field with distance. Tidal forces arise through gravity gradients ( see TIDES ). The gravity g radient at a distance, R , from a mass, M , is proportional to M / R 3 . Thus the greatest gravity gradients are found close to condensed bodies such as NEUTRON STARS and BLACK HOLES . In the latter case they give rise to HAWKING RADIATION . An artificial satellite with an elongated shape will align itself along the gravity gradient; this can be used to orient the spacecraft. Gravity Probe NASA spacecraft that will be launched in about 2003 to test Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY by measuring the precession of gyroscopes in Earth orbit. The development spacecraft has been delayed several years and is still under budgetary scrutiny. The spacecraft will slowly roll about the line of sight to a guide star viewed by a reference telescope, while four gyroscopes, cooled by liquid helium, will compare data from the telescope to an accuracy of 0.1 milliarcsecond. The polar-orbiting satellite is to look for the expected 6.6 arcseconds/year precession to the Earth’s rotational axis and the 0.042 arcsecond/year parallel to it. Great Attractor Object that is apparently pulling our LOCAL GROUP of galaxies as well as some nearby clusters towards it. Study of slight temperature differences in the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND has revealed that the Local Group is actually moving towards a tremendous concentration of mass nearly 150 million l.y. away, in the direction of the constellation Leo. This concentration of galaxies and dark matter is gravitationally attracting our Local Group of galaxies and thousands of other galaxies in this part of the Universe. The velocity of the Local Group is currently measured as 620 km/s towards the Great Attractor. It is not clear what makes up the dark matter, or exactly how much of the attractor is in dark matter. The only thing that is clear is the tremendous concentration of mass in that part of the Universe. great circle Circle on the surface of a sphere whose plane passes through the centre of the sphere and which divides the sphere into two equal hemispheres.

The Great Debate itself, organized by George Ellery HALE , took place on 1920 April 26 at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The proponents of the ri v al theories were Heber CURTIS and Harlow SHAPLEY . From his Lick photographic surveys, Curtis had dis- covered that ‘spiral nebulae’ were scarce along the galactic plane – the zone of avoidance; also, many spirals showed dark dust lanes along their horizontal planes, as were apparent in the Milky Way. These observations and his spectroscopic work convinced Curtis that bright, diffuse nebulae were relatively close, lying inside the Milky Way galaxy, but that the spirals were other galaxies, ‘island uni- ve r ses’ or ‘external galaxies’, at much greater distances. This theory was at variance with the ‘metagalaxy’ model proposed by Shapley, which, though it correctly placed the Solar System far from the galactic centre, held that the Galaxy was an immense 300,000 l.y. across (Curtis’ model, following Jacobus KAPTEYN ’ s, called for a smaller Milky Way.) Spiral nebulae belonged to our own Galaxy, Shapley maintained, partly because measurements of their rotational velocities by Adriaan VA N MAANEN – later shown to be in error – indicated that if these systems were as dis- tant as Curtis believed, their outer regions must be rotating we ll in excess of the speed of light. The matter was resolved in 1924–25, when Edwin HUBBLE used CEPHEID VARIABLE stars in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) to show that this galaxy was much farther than even the radius of Shapley’s ‘metagalaxy’, vindicating Curtis’ views. greatest elongation Maximum angular distance, east or west, measured between an INFERIOR PLANET and the Sun, as viewed from Earth. This varies between 18º and 28º for Mercury, and 45º to 47º for Venus.

Great Red Spot (GRS) Largest and longest-lasting a tmospheric feature on JUPITER . It is a huge anti- c yclonically rotating meteorological eddy, which currently is 24,000 km (15,000 mi) long and 11,000 km (7000 mi) wide and centred at a latitude of 22ºS. The Great Red Spot has been observed by ground-based observers for more than 300 years. First reported by Robert Hooke in 1664, it was followed for several years by G. D. Cassini. Drawings by Heinrich Schwabe in 1831, William Dawes in 1851, and Alfred Mayer and the fourth Earl of Rosse in the 1870s all show the Red Spot. The feature became quite prominent in the 1890s, and British Astronomical Association records contain extensive data from that time to the present. Green Bank Observatory Location at Green Bank, W est Virginia, of the 100-m (330-ft) Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT), the world’s largest fully steerable radio dish, a facility of the NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY . Dedicated in 2000 August, the GBT replaced a 90-m (300-ft) dish built in 1962 that collapsed without warning in 1988. It has an unusual design, with a main dish measuring 100 \u0001 110 m (330 \u0001 360 ft) that reflects the incoming radiation to an off-axis feed arm. There is no central obstruction as in a conventional radio telescope, and the response pattern is g reatly improved. The two thousand panels making up the reflective surface are individually controlled by com- puter-driven actuators. green flash Purely atmospheric phenomenon in which the last visible remnant of the setting Sun may suddenly appear to change from red to vivid green for a few seconds as it sinks below the horizon. At higher latitudes, where the Sun sets at a shallow angle, the green flash may last for several seconds. Visibility of the green flash is strongly dependent on atmospheric conditions; stable layering of air over a clear sea horizon during the summer appears to particularly favour its occurrence. A green flash can also occur at sunrise. Like the Sun, the bright planet Venus can also be seen to produce a green flash under favourable conditions as it sets. greenhouse effect Phenomenon whereby the surface of a planet is heated by the trapping of infrared radiation by the A TMOSPHERE . This mechanism is important in the atmospheres of the Earth, Venus and Titan. On Earth, the most important greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide and water vapour, with significant contributions from methane, nitrous oxide, ozone, and anthropogenic h ydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. These gases are transparent to the short- wa ve radiation from the Sun but absorb longer wa v elength infrared radiation from the surface, re- emitting this radiation to the atmosphere and surface, thus raising the overall temperature. In the absence of an a tmosphere, the Earth would have an average temperature of c .256 K instead of 290 K. Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is thought to have played a significant role in the early atmospheres of all the terrestrial planets, and it is currently responsible for the extremely high surface temperature of Venus (737 K). The burning of fossil fuels is rapidly increasing the amount of CO 2 in the Earth’s atmosphere.

From these studies he developed a theory of FREE – FREE TRANSITIONS in hot, highly ionized gases. Greenstein became an authority on stars made from degenerate matter, including white dwarfs, studying their masses and luminosities. He helped Maarten SCHMIDT to make the first definitive identifications of quasars’ optical counterparts. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) Name given to MEAN SOLAR TIME at the Greenwich meridian; it is the popular name for civil time kept in the UK. The need for a standard time across the country came with the development of the railways, from 1825 onwards. For example, passengers travelling from Bristol to London w ould find a ten-minute difference between the time kept in the two cities because local time, measured according to the position of the Sun in the sky, varies with longitude. Eventually the railways adopted Greenwich time, which became known as ‘railway time’, as their standard and in 1880 it became the legal time for the whole country. In 1928 the INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION (IAU) recommended that Greenwich Mean Time should become the standard timescale for scientific purposes and be known as UNIVERSAL TIME (UT). Today, Greenwich Mean Time is still the standard against which the system of TIME ZONES around the globe is measured, each one being an integral number of hours ahead of or behind it. Greenwich Observatory Britain’s former Royal Obser- va tory, founded in 1675 by Charles II to make accurate positional measurements of stars for use in maritime NAV - IGATION . The purpose-built observatory at Greenwich, London by the architect-scientist Christopher Wren (1632–1723) also provided accommodation for the first Astronomer Royal, John FLAMSTEED , who was paid £100 per year yet had to fund the cost of instruments and assis- tants from his own pocket. In 1766 the first Nautical Almanac w as published under the guidance of Nevil MASKELYNE , fulfilling King Charles’ ambition. Throughout most of the 18th and 19th centuries, the Royal Observatory remained dedicated to positional astronomy. Investigations of the physical nature of celestial objects began in the late 19th century under the director- ship of William CHRISTIE . He installed a 0.71-m (28-in.) refractor in the famous Onion Dome, and founded the Physical Observatory, equipping it with a 0.66-m (26-in.) photographic refractor and a 0.76-m (30-in.) reflector. To these were added the 0.91-m (36-in.) Yapp Reflector in 1934, but by then the observing conditions in London skies were deteriorating. Plans to move away from the capital were not acted upon until 1948, when Harold Spencer JONES took up res- idence at Herstmonceux Castle, Sussex, at the start of a ten-year transfer from Greenwich. The institution became the RO YA L GREENWICH OBSERVATORY (RGO), and contin- ued most of the activities previously carried out at Green- wich, including the time service. The old observatory b uildings, known today as the Royal Observatory Green- wich, were developed into a museum as part of the National Maritime Museum. Its main attraction for many visitors is the Prime Meridian of the world. Gregorian calendar System devised by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582, and still in use today, which corrected errors in the previously used JULIAN CALENDAR . By 1582 the Julian calendar, which approximated the actual solar y ear of 365.24219 days to a CALENDAR y ear of 365.25 days with a leap year every fourth year, had accumulated an error of 10 days. Pope Gregory XIII therefore removed 10 days from the calendar, so that in 1582 October 15 followed October 4. He instigated a new system in which only century years divisible by 400 (that is, 1600, 2000 and so on) would be leap years. The start of the year was also changed from March 25 to January 1. The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in the UK, however, until 1752, by which time the error had increased to 11 days, so that September 14 followed Sep- tember 2. Today the Gregorian calendar is used through- out the Western world and parts of Asia. It is also known as the Christian calendar since it uses the birth of Christ as a starting point, subsequent dates being designated anno domini (in the year of our Lord) and preceding dates being BC (before Christ). The accumulated error between the Gregorian year and the true solar year now amounts to just three days in 10,000 years. Gregorian telescope T ype of REFLECTING TELESCOPE designed in 1663 by Scottish astronomer James GREGORY . A parabolic primary mirror with a central hole reflects light to a concave elliptical secondary placed outside the focus, and thence back through the hole to an eyepiece behind the primary where it gives an erect image. It was popular in the 17th and 18th centuries with telescope-makers such as J ames SHORT , as the secondary was easier to make than the convex secondary required for the CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE , and the tube length was shorter than that of a NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE . It is not much used today. Gregory, David (1659–1708) Scottish mathematician and nephew of James GREGORY . He proposed a variety of telescope designs, including ways of making a telescope free from chromatic aberration. Gregory was a strong supporter of Isaac Newton’s theories of calculus and mechanics, publishing a comprehensive summary of those ideas, entitled Astronomiae physicae et g eometricae elementa (1702). His main astronomical interests lay in the newly founded study of optics, also g reatly advanced by Newton. Gregory, James (1638–75) Scottish mathematician who developed many of the fundamental tools of calculus. In his Optica promota (1663) he covered such diverse astronomical topics as elliptical orbits, transits of planets and the determination of parallax, and described a design for a new kind of telescope ( see GREGORIAN TELESCOPE ). Gregory also experimented with the very first example of a DIFFRACTION GRATING , using a fine sea bird’s feather to project the image of the spectrum of sunlight on to a wall in a darkened room. David GREGORY w as his nephew. Grigg–Skjellerup, Comet 26P/ Short-period comet, initially discovered on 1902 July 23 by John Grigg (1838–1920), New Zealand. Poor weather restricted observations at the discovery apparition and prevented derivation of a true orbit. A comet discovered on 1922 May 17 by John Francis Skjellerup (1875–1952), South Africa, was found to be identical, and an elliptical orbit determined. The comet is usually faint. It has had its perihelion distance gradually increased to 0.99 AU following encounters with Jupiter. The current period is 5.11 years. Close approaches to Earth have given rise to periodic displays of Pi Puppid meteors around April 23, as in 1972 and 1977. The GIOTTO spacecraft passed through the tail of 26P/Grigg–Skjellerup on 1992 July 10, finding a lower-than-expected dust density in the comet’s vicinity.

The floor of Grimaldi is smooth, dark and almost featureless as a result of lava resurfacing. Indeed, it is one of the darkest regions on the lunar surface. A number of rilles, called Rimae Grimaldi, are found on Grimaldi’s floor. GRO Abbreviation of COMPTON GAMMA RAY OBSERVATORY ground state Lowest energy state for a system.

Irish telescope-making firm formed by the merger (1925) of firms founded by Thomas and Howard Grubb and Charles Parsons. Thomas Grubb (1800–1878) began making small astronomical telescopes in the 1840s, experimenting with reflector designs at a time when refractors were more popular. He became proficient at constructing sturdy equatorial mountings for large instruments. In 1834 Thomas Romney Robinson (1792–1882) ordered from Grubb a 15-inch (380-mm) Cassegrain reflector for the ARMAGH OBSERVATORY . This was the first large Cassegrain instrument, and the first large reflector to be carried on a polar axis equipped with a clock drive. In 1865 Howard Grubb (1844–1931) joined his father as a telescope-maker, and took over the running of the business in 1868. The next year, the Grubbs complet- ed the 48-inch (1.2-m) Melbourne Reflector. Another of their famous instruments was the 27-inch (0.69-m) refractor for the Vienna Observatory (1880). In 1901 they finished the Radcliffe Telescope for Oxford University’s Radcliffe Observatory, consisting of two refractor tube assemblies, a 24-inch (0.6-m) instrument for visual obser- va tions and a 17 \u0001 \u0002 -inch (0.45-m) photographic telescope, carried on a German equatorial mounting. Several of the ‘astrograph’ photographic refractors used for the CARTE DU CIEL sky-mapping project were made by Grubb. In 1925 Howard retired and his telescope making busi- ness was taken over by Charles Algernon Parsons (1854–1931), son of the Third Earl of R OSSE and famous as the inventor of the steam turbine engine. The company w as renamed Grubb, Parsons & Co. and continued to make many large telescopes, the last of which (1987) was the Royal Greenwich Observatory’s 4.2-m (165-in.)

Grus See feature article GSC Abbreviation of GUIDE STAR CATALOGUE G star Any member of a class of yellow-white stars, the spectra of which are characterized by relatively weak h ydrogen lines, strong ionized calcium lines ( FRAUNHOFER LINES H and K), and, as temperature declines, the beginning of strong neutral calcium and sodium lines (Fraunhofer g and D). MAIN - SEQUENCE dwarf stars range from 5300 K at G9 to 5900 K at G0, with zero-age masses from 0.9 solar mass to just over solar, zero-age luminosities from 0.5 to just above solar, and dwarf lifetimes from 10 billion years to greater than the age of the Galaxy. Giants and supergiants, which, because of lower densities, are about 800 K cooler than the dwarfs, are more difficult to distinguish spectroscopically than in other classes. However, the Wilson–Bappu effect ( see KSTAR ) can yield luminosities. G SUBDWARFS have weakened metal lines and lower metal abundances. The Sun is a G2 dwarf, allowing a good understanding of G stars. G stars have deep convection zones, the Sun’s occu- p ying its outer third. Although they tend to be slow rota- tors (unless in binary systems where they are tidally spun up), G stars have active magnetic fields, which produce CHROMOSPHERES and hot CORONAE . The solar magnetic field is amplified within the Sun. Ropes of magnetic flux float upwards and produce SUNSPOTS where they exit and re-enter the Sun. Interacting and collapsing magnet- ic fields create bright solar FLARES , releasing the magnet- ically confined corona in CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS . Chromospheres produce EMISSION LINES . Stellar chro- mospheres can be recognized by emissions set within the calcium H and K absorptions; coronae can be confirmed through X-ray emission. About two-thirds of the G dwarfs exhibit Sun-like activity. The highest luminosity (and longest period) Cepheids are class G supergiants. Numerous planets have been found orbiting G stars. Bright examples of G stars include the Sun (G2 V), Alpha Centauri-A (G2 V) and Capella (G0 III + G8 III).

Its alternative title, Agena , is also of obscure origin, although it may come from the Latin word genu , meaning ‘knee’, since it marks one of the knees of the centaur, Centaurus. Hadley cell One of the primary circulation cells in the Earth’s ATMOSPHERE , in which air rises over the tropics and descends at the subtropical high-pressure regions located approximately at latitudes 30°N and 30ºS. At the surface, the Hadley cells are represented by the trade winds on either side of the equator. The circulation was originally proposed by George Hadley (1685–1768) in 1735, as a single cell in each hemisphere, with warm air ascending at the equator and cold air descending at the poles. For dynamical reasons such a circulation cannot exist at tropospheric levels on Earth, although a similar circulation does occur in the STRATOSPHERE in winter. It has been proposed that the atmospheric circulation on Venus may be of this form. hadron Elementary particle that interacts through the strong force. All hadrons have nucleon numbers of 1, 0 or \u0002 1, and can be divided into the subclasses baryons, anti- baryons and mesons. Examples of hadrons are protons, anti-protons and pions.

The image of a star can spread into a small disk, and sometimes a halation ring is produced around it. Hale, George Ellery (1868–1938) American pioneer of solar astrophysics who discovered the magnetic fields of sunspots and facilitated the construction of very large telescopes: the 40-inch (1-m) refractor at Yerkes Observatory, the 60-inch (1.5-m) and 100-inch (2.5-m) reflectors at Mount Wilson Observatory, and the 200- inch (5-m) reflector on Mount Palomar, later named the HALE TELESCOPE in his honour. After graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1890, where he constructed the first spec- troheliograph (1890–96), Hale carried out solar research from his private Kenwood Observatory, equipped with a fine 12-inch (300-mm) refractor. He brought these and other instruments to the University of Chicago, where a new, major observatory was being built – Hale had con- vinced Chicago streetcar magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes (1837–1905) to fund the world’s largest refracting tele- scope and the observatory to house it. The 40-inch refrac- tor was first displayed at the 1893 Columbian Exposition, then permanently installed at YERKES OBSERVATORY when that facility opened four years later. In 1905 Hale determined that sunspots are cooler than the surrounding chromosphere, and by observing the ZEE - MAN EFFECT , a splitting of the Sun’s spectral lines, he dis- covered (1908) that sunspots are associated with strong magnetic fields. He went on to show (1919) that solar magnetic fields reverse their polarity twice every 22–23 years. As early as 1904 Hale had persuaded the Carnegie Institution to build an observatory devoted to solar research atop Mount Wilson, near Pasadena, California. The SNOW TELESCOPE was the first major instrument installed at Mount Wilson Observatory, which Hale directed from 1904 to 1923. Mount Wilson became the world’s leading observatory after it acquired, through Hale’s fundraising efforts, the 60-inch reflector in 1908 and, in 1919, the 100-inch HOOKER TELESCOPE . Hale–Bopp, Comet (C/1995 01) Long-period comet, the brightest of the 1990s, discovered independently by American amateur astronomers Alan Hale (1958– ) and Thomas Bopp (1949– ) on 1995 July 22–23. As with Comet KOHOUTEK in 1973, the comet was remarkably bright (mag. \u0005 10) at discovery, given its distance at that time of 7 AU from the Sun. Comet Hale- Bopp, however, lived up to the optimistic forecasts for its performance around perihelion, reached on 1997 April 1 at a distance of 0.91 AU from the Sun. The comet brightened steadily during 1996 and, following conjunction with the Sun, re-emerged into the morning sky in February 1997 as an already-prominent naked-eye object with a distinctive, fanned dust tail and a fainter ion tail. From mid-March, Comet Hale–Bopp became a magnificent object in early evening skies, peaking in brightness at mag. \u0002 0.5 around perihelion, at which time the dust and ion tails reached lengths of 20º and 25º respectively. Close examination of the COMA revealed concentric ‘shells’ of material being ejected from the NUCLEUS , indicating a rotation period of 11.5 hours. The nucleus is large, with an estimated diameter of 40 km (25 mi). Comet Hale–Bopp showed a strong ANTITAIL around 1998 January 5.

Hale Telescope P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY ’s famous 200-inch (5-m) reflector, for more than a quarter of a century the world’s largest optical telescope. It is named after George Ellery HALE , whose organizational genius lay behind the project’s commencement in the 1920s. Although he witnessed the successful casting of the mirror blank in 1934 December (at the second attempt), Hale died a decade before the telescope was finally declared finished in 1949 November. The telescope has had a distinguished career in all areas of astronomy and continues to provide front-line service, despite increasing LIGHT POLLUTION from nearby San Diego. half-life (symbol t \u0001 \u0002 ) Time taken during an exponential decay process, such as RADIOACTIVITY , for half the av ailable reactions to have occurred. Half-lives can range from tiny fractions of a second to billions of years. For example, the oxygen-15 isotope that is involved in the CARBON – NITROGEN – O XYGEN CYCLE has a half-life of 124 seconds. The term can be used for related processes, such as a neutron splitting into a proton and electron (half-life of 12 minutes). The average, or mean, lifetime of a particle is 1.44 times its half-life. Hall, Asaph (1829–1907) American astronomer who, in 1877 August, discovered Phobos and Deimos, the two tiny satellites of Mars. He used the United States Naval Observatory’s 26-inch (0.66-m) refracting telescope, at the time the largest in the world, to detect the satellites visually. He had previously used the same instrument to discover a white spot in Saturn’s atmosphere, allowing him accurately to determine that planet’s rotational period. Hall also found that the orbit of Saturn’s satellite Hyperion was precessing by about 20º every year. Halley, Comet 1P/ Brightest and probably most famous SHORT - PERIOD COMET ; it is the only one to have been seen regularly with the naked eye. Comet 1P/Halley has been observed at each return since 240 BC , and it was first reliably noted in Chinese annals from the winter of 1059–1058 BC . The comet has a highly elliptical orbit, with a period of about 76 years. Its most recent perihelion, 0.587 AU from the Sun, between the orbits of Mercury and Venus, was on 1986 February 9. Aphelion carries 1P/Halley out beyond the orbit of Neptune, to a distance of 35.295 AU from the Sun. The orbit is retrograde, with an inclination of 162º.2. The comet is named after the second British Astronomer Royal, Edmond Halley, who was first to cal- culate its orbit, making the connection between a comet he had seen in 1682 and previous recorded apparitions in 1531 and 1607. Halley successfully predicted its next return, in 1759. Historically, Halley’s Comet has made a great impres- sion on observers at a number of past returns. Its appear- ance in 1066, when it passed 0.1 AU from Earth and reached mag. \u0001 4, shortly preceded the Norman Con- quest of England, and the comet is depicted in the Bayeux Ta pestry with the Saxon courtiers looking on in horror as King Harold totters on his throne. In 1301 the comet was seen by the Florentine painter Giotto di Bondone, who used it as a model for the Star of Bethlehem in his 1304 fresco Adoration of the Magi in the Arena Chapel in Padua. The comet’s apparitions vary considerably in terms of how favourably it may be viewed. In AD 837, 1P/Halley passed 0.034 AU (510,000 km/320,000 mi) from Earth, with the COMA shining as brightly as Venus and its tail spanning 90º of sky. At the 1910 return, closest approach w as 0.15 AU, with the comet reaching mag. 0; Earth actu- ally passed through the comet’s tail on May 20 of that y ear. The most recent return, in 1985–86, however, was relatively unfavourable, with 1P/Halley never closer than 0.42 AU (April 11) and being fairly close to the Sun in the sky when at perihelion. In the early months of 1986, the comet reached mag. \u0002 3.0 and showed a 10º tail. Although unfavourable in many respects for Earth- bound observers, the 1985–86 return was extremely rewarding scientifically. Observations across a range of astronomical disciplines were co-ordinated by an Interna- tional Halley Watch, with the results being archived central- ly at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, USA. Early in 1986 March a flotilla of spacecraft passed close to the comet, sending back an immense quantity of data on its structure and composition. The nucleus was imaged by the European Giotto spacecraft and found to be an irregular body with an extremely dark (albedo 0.04) outer crust and dimensions of roughly 15 \u0003 8 km (9 \u0003 5m i). An estimated 3.1 tonnes of dust was being ejected from the nucleus each second at around the time of the Giotto close approach on 1986 March 13; even at this rate of loss, 1P/Halley may have an active lifetime of more than 100,000 years. Large ground-based telescopes were able to follow the comet on its way out from perihelion until it was at the distance of Uranus’ orbit in 1994. Surprisingly, 1P/Halley showed an outburst of activity in February 1991, when 14.3 AU from the Sun (beyond Saturn’s orbit). The cause of this brightening is uncertain, but it may have been con- nected with shockwaves from a CORONAL MASS EJECTION propagated through the SOLAR WIND . The comet’s next return, in 2061, will be even less favourable than that of 1985–86, with 1P/Halley at peri- helion while close to conjunction on the far side of the Sun from Earth. Comet 1P/Halley is the parent of the METEOR STREAM that produces the ETA AQUARIDS and ORIONIDS . Halley, Edmond (1656–1742) English scientist, the second ASTRONOMER ROYAL , famous for the long-period comet named after him, his observation and cataloguing of southern stars, his part in the publication of Newton’s Principia , and his discovery of stellar proper motions. Outside astronomy, his accomplishments were numerous. He founded geophysics, charting variations in the Earth’s magnetic field and establishing the magnetic character of the aurora borealis. He showed that atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, and studied monsoons and trade winds. Halley was one of the first to use mortality statistics to cost life assurance policies. He matriculated at Oxford University in 1673, where he made his earliest published observations, including one of a lunar occultation of Mars in 1676. At that time he also began assisting the first Astronomer Royal, John FLAM - STEED , with observations of star positions at the Green- wich Observatory. Halley never completed his formal studies at Oxford, opting in 1676 November to voyage to the South Atlantic island of St Helena to map the stars of the southern hemisphere. Despite poor weather, he made observations from which he compiled a catalogue of 341 southern stars, observed a transit of Mercury, and carried out comprehensive meteorological and hydrographic studies. Also, he confirmed that the period of a pendulum H Halley, Edmond 171 \u0001 Halley, Comet 1P/ The elongated elliptical orbit of Halley’s Comet takes it from aphelion beyond the orbit of Neptune to perihelion between the orbits of Venus and Mercury.

When Halley returned, King Charles II bestowed upon him a degree from Oxford. Halley then published his southern star catalogue, Catalogus stellarum australium , and devised a method for determining the solar parallax from his observations of the transit of Mercury. In the 1680s, as an outgrowth of his interest in the INVERSE - SQUARE LAW of gravitation – which he managed to derive from Kepler’s third law – and its implication that the planets must move in elliptical orbits, Halley befriended Isaac NEWTON . He encouraged and paid for the publication of Newton’s PRINCIPIA , and even corrected the book’s proofs. From 1686 to 1693 Halley edited the famous Philo- sophical Transactions of the Royal Society. In the 1690s, he began a mathematical investigation of the orbits of comets, paying close attention to the bright comets of 1531, 1607 and 1682. He concluded that these three comets, as well as similar objects appearing in 1305, 1380 and 1456, were just different apparitions of the same comet, which had a period of 76 years. Taking into account the perturbations of Jupiter, he calculated an orbit for the comet indicating it w ould return in 1758. Although he did not live to see his prediction come true, he achieved immortality when it appeared on Christmas Day of that year. Comet 1P/ HAL - LEY has since become the best-studied of all comets. After further scientific voyages (1698–1701), Halley w as appointed Savilian Professor of Geometry at Oxford in 1704, where he continued his astronomical work. In 1710, after noting that the observed positions of some stars differed significantly from their coordinates given in Ptole- my ’s catalogue, he confirmed PROPER MOTION in three bright stars – Sirius, Arcturus and Procyon. In 1720 he published a paper in which he discussed what is now called OLBERS ’ P ARADOX , arguing for the infinity of space. Also in that year, Halley succeeded Flamsteed as Astronomer Royal, a post he held for 21 years. During his tenure he modernized the Greenwich Observatory, installing the first transit instrument and devising a method for determining longitude at sea by using lunar observations. halo Ring of light seen round a celestial body. A halo is an atmospheric phenomenon produced as a result of refraction by ice crystals in thin cirrus cloud at altitudes of 10–15 km (6–9 mi), near the top of the TROPOSPHERE . The commonest form of halo is a 46º diameter ring of light with the Sun or Moon at its centre. Lunar haloes are usually only seen when the Moon is within five days of full; at other times its light is not sufficiently bright. Solar haloes often show some colour, with a blue outer and red inner edge; the sky inside the halo is noticeably darker than that outside. halo (galactic halo) Extensive distribution of stars in the outer regions of a GALAXY .

It moved to its present location at Bergedorf, 20 km (12 mi) east of Hamburg, in 1909. The observatory operates several small telescopes, including a 1-m (40-in.) reflector, and has been part of the University of Hamburg since 1968. Today, the observatory’s research centres around theoretical astrophysics, together with studies of metal-poor stars, the interstellar medium, quasars and gravitational lenses. Harriot, Thomas (1560–1621) English mathematician, astronomer and surveyor. He came to move in the circle of John Dee (1527–1608), and under the patronage of Sir W alter Raleigh, whom he had tutored, spent 1585 as a member of a survey expedition to Virginia. He and his W elsh friend William Lower ( c .1570–1650) began to use the telescope for astronomy some time before Galileo. By 1609 he had studied Jupiter’s satellites, observed sunspots (deriving the Sun’s rotation period) and mapped the Moon, though he never published his results. Harrison, John (1693–1776) English instrument- maker who invented the MARINE CHRONOMETER to solve the problem of finding longitude at sea. When in 1714 the British Government offered a £20,000 prize for the solution of the problem, Harrison devoted his life to the perfection of a sea-going ‘chronometer’. Between 1735 and 1761, he produced four chronometers, each of which was an improvement on its predecessor, and in due course received the prize money. Contrary to popular mythology, Harrison was a highly respected scientist, not an outsider at odds with the British scientific establishment. Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory (HartRAO) South African national research facility in the Magaliesburg Hills 65 km (40 mi) north-west of J ohannesburg. Built as a NASA tracking station in 1961 and converted for radio astronomy in 1975, the observatory became a national facility in 1988. It has a 26-m (85-ft) fully steerable dish – the only major radio telescope in Africa. Hartmann, Johann Franz (1865–1936) German astronomer who made many important breakthroughs in astrophysics while working at the observatories at P otsdam (1896–1909), Göttingen (1909–21) and La Plata (1921–34), often with instruments he designed and built himself. One such device was a microphotometer, which used photoelectric cells to measure the density of light passing through photographic plates of starfields; this intensity was then compared to images of stars to be photometrically measured. He also devised a method for testing lenses that is named after him. Hartmann discovered the presence of interstellar matter by studying the spectrum of the spectroscopic binary \u0002 Orionis in 1904. Harvard classification Classification system for stellar spectra developed at Harvard College Observatory by Edward PICKERING , Williamina FLEMING , Antonia MAURY and Annie CANNON between 1890 and 1901. Stars were lettered from A to Q primarily on the basis of the strength of the HYDROGEN SPECTRUM . Several letters were then dropped as unnecessary, while B was placed in front of A, and O in front of B, such that other absorption lines (principally helium) formed a continuous sequence. The result was the spectral sequence OBAFGKM, which correlates with both colour and temperature.

Hawking, Stephen William (1942– ) English theoretical physicist who has applied general relativity and quantum theory to cosmology, greatly advancing the understanding of BLACK HOLES and SPACETIME . While still a graduate student at Cambridge University, where he has spent his entire career, Hawking was diagnosed in 1963 with a degenerative neuromuscular disease and told he had only 18 months to live; against these odds, he has survived to become the foremost researcher of theoretical relativistic cosmology. In the late 1960s, Hawking demonstrated that a singular- ity must have characterized the beginning of the Universe in the BIG BANG . In the early 1970s, he developed mathe- matical proofs of the ‘no hair theorem’ originated by physi- cist John Archibald Wheeler (1911– ), which states that a black hole’s gravitational field is defined by three quantities – its mass, angular momentum and electric charge. In 1971 Hawking showed that the Big Bang could have gi v en rise to numerous ‘mini black holes’, exotic objects the size of a proton but with a mass of about a billion tonnes. In 1974 he discovered that the physical tempera- ture of a black hole is not necessarily absolute zero. Hawk- ing’s model of black holes showed that they can emit a kind of thermal radiation by the simultaneous creation of pairs of matter and anti-matter particles. This process, called HAWKING RADIATION , implies that the black hole shrinks and may eventually evaporate, since it is gradually converting its own mass into thermal energy. Cambridge University appointed Hawking Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1979. In 1983 he put forth his ‘no-boundary proposal’: that although both space and time are infinite, these quantities have no physical bound- aries. Hawking has popularized many of his theories through a series of magazine articles, books and television programmes; his book A Brief History of Time (1988) spent 4 years on the bestseller lists. Hawking radiation Radiation that is emitted from a BLACK HOLE ; the process was proposed by Stephen HAWKING . From quantum field theory (the theory developed by Max PLANK in 1900, which proposes that va r ious properties of a system, including energy, can only change by discrete amounts), it can be deduced that v acuum fluctuations occur throughout space whereby pairs of virtual particles are created. If such a pair is created near the EVENT HORIZON of a black hole, one particle may lie just on the inside, one on the outside, and the outside particle would be free to radiate away. A black hole of one solar mass will evaporate over 10 67 y ears. A black hole at the centre of a galaxy will take around 10 97 y ears to evaporate. Primordial black holes created in the Big Bang will have already disappeared. Hayashi track Pa th on a HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM that a pre- MAIN - SEQUENCE star follows as it evolves on to the main sequence. It is named after the J apanese astrophysicist Chushiro Hayashi (1920– ), who studied stellar evolution during the 1950s and 1960s. PROTOSTARS lie to the right of the main sequence. An initial rapid collapse of the protostar, which is poorly under- stood, moves the star leftwards out of the so-called Hayashi forbidden zone. This collapse is followed by a large decrease in LUMINOSITY , caused by the contracting radius. This line on the diagram is called the Hayashi track. During this phase the star is almost entirely convective, with only a small radiative core. Finally, the star becomes radiative and approaches the main sequence along the HENYEY TRACK . Haystack Observatory Multidisciplinary research facility of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) at Westford, Massachusetts, engaged in radio astronomy, geodesy, atmospheric science, radio interferometry and radar imaging, established in 1964 originally as a military facility.

This law states that in a closed system, ENTROPY can only increase or remain constant – or that heat is transferred only from warmer masses to cooler ones. The Universe ‘dies’ once when all matter has reached the same temperature, for then the Universe’s entropy will have reached a maximum, and there will be no energy available. This ‘running down’ was pointed out by Lord KELVIN , who preferred to avoid such a fate by invoking an omnipotent force that created living beings.

The Nile flood w as an important event in the Egyptian calendar, heralding the first of three seasons; after the river subsided, planting of crops could commence, followed by the harvest. heliocentric parallax Alternative name for ANNUAL P ARALLAX . See also DIURNAL PARALLAX ; TRIGONOMETRIC P ARALLAX heliocentric theory Model of the Solar System in which the Sun is at the centre and the planets revolve around it. A heliocentric theory was proposed by the Greek astronomer ARISTARCHUS in the 3rd century BC , but it seemed counter-intuitive at the time and was not widely adopted. GEOCENTRIC THEORY , championed by Aristotle and Ptolemy and by later scholars and theologians, was to remain supreme for nearly 1500 years. It was Nicholas Copernicus who re-invigorated helio- centric theory with his COPERNICAN SYSTEM , published the y ear of his death. Opposed by both Roman Catholic and Protestant ecclesiastics, its influence spread only very slow- ly. However, the great improvements in observational accuracy introduced by Tycho BRAHE showed up the inad- equacy of geocentric theory. Brahe himself favoured a h ybrid, now referred to as the TYCHONIC SYSTEM , in which the Earth remained at rest and was orbited by the Sun, but the other planets orbited the Sun. His observations showed that the stars were much more distant than the planets and he also realized that comets moved in orbits that would have taken them through the ‘crystalline spheres’ of Aristo- tle’s geocentric theory. Thus the spheres could not be real. The telescopic discoveries by GALILEO – that a body other than the Earth, namely Jupiter, had moons in orbit around it, that the planet Venus exhibited phases like the Earth’s Moon and that the Sun was covered in spots which made it less than ‘perfect’ – was evidence enough to put an end to the geocentric theory. Galileo’s open advocacy of the Copernican position placed him in conflict with elements within the Catholic Church. His main publication in sup- port of heliocentrism, the DIALOGUES of 1632, led to his trial before the Inquisition. When Johannes Kepler, using data accumulated by Brahe, discovered his three laws ( see KEPLER ’ SLAWS ), the need for the complicated epicyclic motions was swept aside by the simplicity of elliptical orbits. In the decades following Kepler’s and Galileo’s discov- eries, heliocentric theory gained wide acceptance. Isaac Newton, with the publication of his PRINCIPIA in 1686–87, showed that the assumption of an INVERSE - SQUARE LAW of gr a vitational attraction would account for Kepler’s laws. F ollowing his work, the heliocentric theory of the Solar System could no longer be questioned.

They both approached the Sun to within 43 million km (26.7 million miles). helioseismology Study of the structure and dynamics of the SOLAR INTERIOR by the analysis of sound waves that propagate through the Sun and manifest themselves as oscillations of the PHOTOSPHERE . Helioseismology is a hybrid name combining the Greek words helios (for Sun), seismos (meaning quake or tremor) and logos (for reasoning or discourse). The periods of the vertical oscillations are usually around five minutes, but they can range to a few hours long. They are most often detected by the DOPPLER EFFECT of a solar ABSORPTION LINE formed in the photosphere, but they can also be detected by light variations of the photosphere. There are millions of distinct, resonating, sound waves whose periods depend on their propagation speeds and the depths of their resonant cavities. Examination of the photosphere oscillations that the sound waves produce enables helioseismologists to infer the temperature, chemical composition and motions at different depths within the Sun. heliosphere Vast region of space surrounding the Sun where the interplanetary magnetic field and SOLAR WIND have a dominant influence on the movements of electrons and ions. The heliosphere, immersed in the local interstellar medium, defines the extent of the Sun’s influence. It extends well beyond the planets to the heliopause, which is located at a distance from the Sun of about 100 AU. This outer boundary marks the place where the solar wind pressure balances that in interstellar space. heliostat Flat, equatorially mounted mirror that is driven to follow the Sun’s apparent motion across the sky and to direct its light into a fixed solar telescope. Because of the long focal length of a SOLAR TELESCOPE , and the fact that the heat of the Sun creates a layer of warm, turbulent air close to the ground, the heliostat is usually mounted on the top of a tall tower. As it follows the Sun across the sky, the image it forms slowly rotates during the course of the day and, because of this, the more sophisticated COELO - STAT is sometimes preferred. See also SIDEROSTAT helium (symbol He) Second lightest chemical element; it is the second most abundant element in the Universe ( see ASTROCHEMISTRY ). Helium-4 forms almost 100% of the naturally occurring element and has an atomic number of 2 and an atomic mass of 4.0026 amu. Helium is the lightest of the ‘noble’ gases – those elements that are virtually inert chemically. Its boiling point is 4.2 K. There are five known isotopes, three of which (helium-3, helium-4 and helium-5) are stable. The nucleus of helium-4 is also called the \u0001 -particle (alpha particle). Helium is thought to be generated by NUCLEOSYNTHE - SIS in stars. The basic reaction, which powers MAIN - SEQUENCE stars, involves the FUSION of hydrogen to form helium via the PROTON – PROTON REACTION and the CAR - BON – NITROGEN – OXYGEN CYCLE . However, the present abundance of helium in the Universe cannot be explained solely by nucleosynthesis in stars. It is now generally accepted that most of the helium observed today was syn- thesized during the first few minutes of the BIG BANG . The sequence of nucleosynthetic reactions continues after the formation of helium with the TRIPLE - \u0001 PROCESS , in which three helium-4 nuclei collide almost simultaneously to form carbon-12. The reaction requires a temperature of around 100 million K for its initiation. Helium was first identified in the solar spectrum by Jules JANSSEN and Joseph LOCKYER in 1868 as a set of lines that did not correspond with those for any element then known. It was named after Helios , the Greek for ‘Sun’. It was found on Earth in 1895 as a gas released by radioactivity from the mineral clevite. Helium is used to pressurize the propellant tanks of some liquid-fuelled rockets and, in liquid form, to cool many infrared and radio detectors. helium flash Theoretically predicted event in the evolution of a lower-mass star (around 1 to 2 solar masses) whereby helium fusion occurs explosively, with changes in the central regions of the star occurring over timescales of minutes. After the hydrogen in the core of a MAIN - SEQUENCE star has been exhausted, the star becomes a RED GIANT , with hydrogen SHELL BURNING occurring. The core col- lapses until temperatures of 10 8 K are reached, when heli- um burning can start. In stars of low mass, this event occurs explosively and is known as the helium flash. In stars of higher mass, helium fusion will commence gradu- ally because the temperature in the core can reach this point before the core becomes degenerate. See also DEGENERATE MATTER helium star Non-white dwarf star, the outer layers of which contain more helium than hydrogen. A helium star is an EVOLVED STAR that has lost its hydrogen-rich envelope, possibly by the effect of a companion in a CLOSE BINARY system, thereby exposing its helium core. The R CORONAE BOREALIS stars are examples of helium stars. The term ‘helium star’ was also originally used for B-type stars. Helix Nebula (NGC 7293) PLANETARY NEBULA in southern Aquarius (RA 22 h 29 m .6 dec. \u0002 20º48 \u0003 ). Lying less than 300 l.y. away, the Helix is one of the closest planetary nebulae and, as a result, subtends a large angular diameter of 13 \u0003 . Ostensibly bright, at mag. \u0004 7.3, the nebula is spread over such a wide area that it has low surface brightness and is consequently rather difficult to observe visually.

Hellas Planitia itself lies well below this level, and at its deepest point, near to the western rim, it descends to 5 km (3 mi). Hellas’ rugged hilly rim is between 50 and 400 km (30–250 mi) in width and is associated with a concentric pattern of fracturing that extends as far as 1600 km (1000 mi) from the centre of the floor. The floor of the basin is occupied by plains materials, which are believed to be volcanic in origin, and is mantled by windblown debris. Large sections of the rim are either missing or dif- ficult to trace due either to erosion or to later burial by y ounger deposits. The most continuous section lies on the w estern side, where it passes into the blocky mountains of Hellespontus Montes. Spacecraft imagery reveals there to be several annular, inward-facing scarps outside of the main rim, together with a small number of large ancient v olcanic structures, such as Amphitrites Patera and Hadriaca Patera. The floor of Hellas Planitia is occupied by rather complex plains units, on the surface of which are small impact craters and some short channel systems. Helwân Observatory Egyptian observatory at Helwân, about 30 km (20 mi) south of Cairo. Dating from the turn of the 20th century, the observatory was equipped with a 0.76-m (30-in.) reflector in 1905. A new observing station was set up at Kottamia, 70 km (45 mi) north-east of Helwân in the 1950s, and a 1.9-m (74-in.) telescope began work there in 1964; it was upgraded in the late 1990s. Henderson, Thomas (1798–1844) Scottish astronomer, second Astronomer at the Cape (1831–33) and first Astronomer Royal for Scotland (1834–44). His observations from South Africa in 1832 provided the first parallax for \u0001 Centauri, though he did not announce his result (0 \u0002 .93, corresponding to a distance of 3.5 l.y.) until 1839, the year after Friedrich Wilhelm BESSEL ’s measurement of the parallax of Sixty-one Cygni. Henderson made over 60,000 observations of star positions, leading to the compilation of several important star catalogues. Henry, Paul Pierre (1848–1905) and Henry, Prosper Mathieu (1849–1903) French brothers whose achievements in ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY helped to stimulate the CARTE DU CIEL sky survey. The Henrys discovered 14 asteroids, beginning with (175) Liberatrix in 1872. Their searches required the preparation by hand of detailed star charts for the ecliptic, so that asteroids would not be confused with stars – a labour-intensive and error-prone procedure. Their successful photography of star clusters, including the Double Cluster in Perseus, a \u0001 \u0002 -hour exposure that recorded stars as faint as 12th magnitude, convinced them that good charts could be prepared photographically. The Henrys designed and built a 13.5-inch (340-mm) refractor for Paris Observatory specifically for astrophotog- raphy, completed in 1885. At the Astrographic Congress on 1887 April 18, observatories round the world agreed to undertake an all-sky photographic survey, the Carte du Ciel , using ‘astrographs’ – telescopes identical to the 13.5-inch at Pa r is – about half of which were made by the Henrys. Henry Draper Catalogue (HD) Catalogue of stellar spectra compiled by Annie CANNON at Harvard College Observatory. It was named after American pioneer of astrophotography Henry DRAPER , whose widow supported the work financially. The catalogue, completed in 1924, classified about 225,000 stars to 10th magnitude according to the Harvard system: O, B, A, F, G, K, M, in order of decreasing surface temperature. The Henry Draper Extension (HDE), with spectral classifications of 47,000 11-th magnitude stars, appeared in 1936. Stars are still widely known by their HD or HDE numbers. See also SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION Henyey track Evolutionary path on a HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM that a pre- MAIN - SEQUENCE star follows from the base of the HAYASHI TRACK to the main sequence. It is named after the American astrophysicist Louis Henyey (1910–70), who studied stellar evolution during the 1950s. Along the Henyey track both EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE and LUMINOSITY increase such that luminosity, L , is pro- portional to effective temperature, T e ( L is proportional to T e 4/5 ). During this phase, energy transfer within the star is largely radiative rather than convective, in contrast to the HAYASHI TRACK . The length of the Henyey track (the increase in T e ) is greater for high-mass stars than low- mass stars, although the time spent on this track is shorter for the high-mass stars. Stars of mass less than 0.5 solar mass do not have a Henyey track, instead they evolve directly on to the main sequence from the Hayashi track. Before reaching the main sequence, the star’s luminosity dips slightly due to the expansion of the star caused by the onset of nuclear burning.

Multiple mare (wrinkle) ridges lie between the two promontories. Herbig–Haro object (HH object) Any of a class of small, faintly luminous nebulae discovered, independently, by George Herbig (1920– ) and Guillermo Haro (1900–1990) in the 1950s. HH objects are irregular in outline and contain bright knots; they are found in regions rich in interstellar material. Their spectra reveal a weak continuum dominated by emission lines from hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and iron. HH objects are produced when high-velocity material, ejected from young stars, interacts with surrounding material. The stars that produce HH objects are thought to be y oung, pre-main-sequence stars that are accreting materi- al via an A CCRETION DISK . The whole system is surround- ed by the material from which the star is forming. High-velocity ejections are then produced, although the mechanism by which this occurs is not yet fully under- stood, and they interact with the surrounding material producing shock waves. The shock waves heat and ionize the surrounding gas, producing the emission lines observed in HH objects. HH objects are roughly split into low and high-excita- tion objects, according to their spectra. The difference is thought to be caused by the velocities of the shock waves. High-excitation HH objects, with strong emission lines of highly ionized material, suggest shock wave velocities of 200 km/s (120 mi/s), while low-excitation HH objects H Helwân Observatory 176 \u0001 Hellas Planitia The largest impact structure on Mars, Hellas Planitia is one of the most obvious features in the planet’s southern hemisphere.

The orbital period of the binary is 1.7 days, and there is also a 35-day modulation of the X-ray emission possibly caused by precession of the accretion disk. Since Hercules X-1 is an eclipsing binary, the stellar masses can be determined – 0.98 solar mass for the neutron star and 1.99 solar mass for the companion. Hermes Third APOLLO ASTEROID to be discovered, in 1937, when it was passing within about 800,000 km (500,000 mi) of the Earth. This close approach led to the popular assumption of a name despite the orbit not being sufficiently well determined to allow Hermes to be added to the list of numbered asteroids. Hermes was observed for only a few days and then lost. It was catalogued as 1937 UB.

Its founder was Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel (1738–1822), who settled in England in 1757 and assumed the name William HERSCHEL when he became a naturalized Englishman. In 1772 he was joined by his youngest sister, Karoline Lucretia Herschel (1750–1848), who became his astronomical assistant ( see Caroline HERSCHEL ). William w as also aided by his son, John Frederick William HERSCHEL (1792–1871), who went on to become one of the foremost English scientists of his day. John’s son Alexander Stewart Herschel (1836–1907), born during his father’s sojourn at the Cape of Good Hope, determined a number of meteor radiants and their association with cometary orbits. The male line of the British Herschels is now extinct. Herschel, Caroline Lucretia (1750–1848) German astronomer, sister of and assistant to William HERSCHEL , and aunt of John HERSCHEL . Karoline Herschel (the German form of her name) was born in Hanover and w orked as a family drudge until 1772, when William brought her to England, where she became first his domestic companion, then his musical protégée, and finally his astronomical assistant. When they moved to Datchet and Slough she started sweeping the sky herself, discovering several nebulae (including the Sculptor Galaxy, NGC 253, in 1783) and eight comets. When William died in 1822, she returned to Hanover, where she received many honours. Herschel, John Frederick William (1792–1871) English scientist and astronomer, the only child of William HERSCHEL ’s marriage to Mary Pitt in 1788. After studying mathematics, and an abandoned attempt at training for the legal profession, he became his father’s protégé and successor in astronomy, discovering several hundred new nebulae and clusters from England. John Herschel’s main goal was to extend his father’s sky surveys, undertaken for the purpose of fathoming the ‘construction of the heavens’, what we would call cosmology. In 1834 he took one of William’s telescopes to the Cape of Good Hope (modern South Africa) to survey the southern skies, and found 1200 new double stars and 1700 new nebulae and clusters. By 1840 Herschel’s observing career was effectively ov er. The rest of his life was devoted to interpreting his, and his father’s, cosmological work, and acting as an interna- tional consultant for all things astronomical and physical. He compiled the General Catalogue of Nebulae and Clusters from his and his father’s observations; this would form the basis for J.L.E. Dreyer’s NEW GENERAL CATALOGUE . Her- schel’s Outlines of Astronomy (1849) remained a standard textbook for many decades. He was also a pioneer of early photographic chemistry and astrophotography. Herschel, (Frederick) William (1738–1822) German- born English astronomer and musician.

He observed and catalogued many double stars, nebulae and clusters. Herschel realized that the Milky Way is the plane of a disk-shaped stellar universe, the form of which he calculated by counting the numbers of stars visible in different directions, thus establishing for the first time what he called the ‘construction of the heavens’. Wilhelm Friedrich Herschel, as he was christened, was born in Hanover, the son of an army band musician. As a boy he received a surprisingly good education at the garrison school, especially in music, and visited England in 1756 with his regiment. Finding that England offered abundant well-paid opportunities for skilled musicians, he returned in 1757, resolved to seek his fortune. After several years of hard work, his reputation won him the prestigious post of organist at Bath’s fashionable Octa- gon Chapel in 1766. In 1772 he brought his sister Caro- line Lucretia HERSCHEL from Germany to become his domestic companion and to allow her to pursue her own musical career. By 1771 William Frederick (as he now called himself) was earning £400 a year from music – a very handsome income for the time – and, as Caroline recorded, William’s interest in the mathematical harmonics of music aroused in him a curiosity about the mathematical basis of light and astronomy. In 1773 he started to make reflecting tele- scopes with mirrors made from speculum (Latin for ‘mir- ror’) metal, and used them to observe the heavens from the Herschel’s house at 19 New King Street, Bath (now the Herschel Museum). He soon showed himself to be a brilliantly gifted practical optician, for it was later declared by Nevil MASKELYNE , the Astronomer Royal, that his reflecting telescopes were superior to any professionally made instruments then on sale in London. Herschel was thrust into international celebrity in 1781 when he discov- ered a ‘comet’ that soon turned out to be the planet Uranus – the first new planet in the Solar System to be discovered in recorded history. This find, however, was the unexpected by-product of one of Herschel’s surveys of the sky with a 6-inch (150-mm) reflecting telescope. He had begun systemati- cally to ‘sweep’ the skies on a zonal basis, primarily as part of a strategy aimed at discovering star clusters, binary stars and nebulae, and trying to understand their distribu- tion on the sky. By the mid-1780s, indeed, this technique had led him to conclude that the Milky Way consisted of a flat plane of stars running through space, so that when one looked through the long axis of the plane one saw dense starfields all around, whereas when one looked at right angles out of the plane, one saw relatively few stars. This observation still holds good for the general structure of our Galaxy, though not for the Universe in general. Herschel’s discovery of Uranus fundamentally changed his career. The international fame that it brought won him (and his sister Caroline) royal patronage, William’s fellow- ship of the Royal Society, and an annual pension of £200, which enabled him to give up music and devote himself full-time to astronomy. This drop in income was more than made up, however, by commercial demand for his telescopes. Herschel produced the optics, and employed joiners to make the elegant mahogany tubes and stands. A Herschel 6-inch refractor of 7 ft (2.1 m) focal length sold for £105, while bigger instruments, built for European royalty, could cost as much as £3150. Herschel’s truly creative decade was the 1780s, for in the wake of the MESSIER CATALOGUE of 1784, his sky sur- veys increased the number of known deep-sky objects to over 2000. He was the first scientist to realize that the cos- mos is not unchanging, but dynamic, as stars were now understood to form clusters under gravity, disintegrate into nebulous matter, and then re-condense into incandes- cent stars. Herschel also realized that the light from dim objects gathered by his 18 \u0001 \u0002 -inch (0.48-m, 1783) and 48-inch (1.2-m, 1788) aperture telescopes of 20 and 40 ft (6 and 12 m) focal length had been travelling through space for so long that when observing them, one was look- ing into the past. By 1795 Herschel had pushed contem- porary optical technology as far as it could go, and he spent the remaining 27 years of his life trying to obtain new data to make further breakthroughs. But not until the invention of ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY and astronomical spec- troscopy in the next century would this be possible. In 1788 Herschel married Mary Pitt, and in 1792 John Fred- erick William HERSCHEL wa s born to them. Herschelian telescope Type of telescope developed by William HERSCHEL in the late 18th century. It uses a PARABOLOIDAL primary, as in the NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE , but the primary is tilted so that the image is formed to one side of the incoming light, obviating the need for a secondary mirror: there is thus no central obstruction. The EYEPIECE is aimed down the tube, with the observer facing the main mirror. This optical arrangement, also known as the front-view system, introduced image distortions, and was soon superseded by the achromatic refractor and the silver-on-glass Newtonian reflector. Herschel–Rigollet, Comet 38P/ Comet found by Caroline Herschel on 1788 December 21 and unexpectedly recovered in 1939 July by Roger Rigollet (1909–81). At each return, the comet attained peak mag. \u0001 7.5. Initially thought to be parabolic, the comet’s elliptical orbit has a current period of 155 years.

Hertzsprung spent most of his career (1919–44) at the Leiden Observatory, which he directed for nine years.

Hertzsprung’s work spanned the extremes of stellar types: the Cepheids are highly luminous yellow supergiants; and, in contrast, he w as the first to classify, in 1911, the giant and dwarf subdivisions of late-type stars. The culmination of this work, based in part on the w ork of pioneering astronomer Antonia MAURY , was his invention of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, so called because the American astronomer Henry Norris R USSELL later rediscovered the relation. Hertzsprung found, by plotting luminosity against temperature for many individ- ual stars, that most ‘normal’ stars, including the Sun, fall along a well-defined curve called the main sequence. His results were published in 1905 and 1907 in an obscure journal, and were unknown to Russell. Hertzsprung gap Region to the right of the MAIN SEQUENCE on the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM where ve ry few stars are seen. The gap exists because stars move very rapidly through this region. In the gap, the stars are evolving off the main sequence, burning h ydrogen in shells before helium burning starts in the core. They travel on near-horizontal tracks with near- constant luminosity as the radius expands with a corresponding drop in effective temperature. Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (HR diagram) Plot of the ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE of stars against their spectral class. It is equivalent to a plot of the luminosity of stars against their surface temperature. The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram is an extremely valuable tool wherein observational and theoretical information are blended to produce a deep understanding of STELLAR EVOLUTION . It is a very powerful diagram, able to represent almost the entire evolution of any star. There are a finite number of equations defining a star’s structure at every point in its life. These equations are interpreted on an HR diagram, so that determining the position of any star on an HR diagram will give information on its structure and evolutionary phase. In the early 1900s Ejnar HERTZSPRUNG in Denmark and Henry Norris R USSELL in the United States indepen- dently began to consider how the brightnesses of stars might be related to their spectra. In 1911 Hertzsprung plotted the APPARENT MAGNITUDES of stars in several clus- ters against their spectral class. In 1913 Russell plotted the absolute magnitudes of stars in the solar neighbourhood against their spectral class. Both astronomers emphasized the non-random patterns they saw in the arrangement of the data on these graphs. Such graphs have become extremely important in modern astronomy and are today called Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams. A Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, or HR diagram, is any graph on which a parameter measuring stellar bright- ness is plotted against a parameter related to a star’s sur- face temperature. For example, apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, absolute BOLOMETRIC MAGNITUDE or LUMINOSITY may be plotted along the horizontal axis, while spectral class, COLOUR INDEX or EFFECTIVE TEMPER - A TURE may be plotted along the vertical axis. Three HR diagrams are shown with this article, with diagram A being a schematic showing all the different regions. Diagram B resembles Russell’s original graph. Each dot represents a star whose absolute magnitude and spectral class have been determined from observations. Most of the data lie along a broad line called the MAIN SEQUENCE , which extends diagonally across the diagram. The Sun (absolute magnitude around +5, spectral type G2) is a typical main-sequence star. A second prominent g rouping of data points represents very large, cool stars called RED GIANTS . In the lower left corner, a third grouping identifies compact, hot stars called WHITE DWARFS . Diagram C shows an HR diagram with luminosity of stars plotted against their surface temperature. Notice that temperature increases towards the left. The spectral class- es OBAFGKM constitute a temperature sequence, and the first HR diagrams were drawn with the hot O stars on the left and the cool M stars on the right because the astronomers did not realise exactly what they were plot- ting. Although this means the temperature scale increases to the left, HR diagrams are still plotted this way today. These HR diagrams show that the total range in stellar brightness is around 27 magnitudes (corresponding to a factor of 10 11 in luminosity), and the range in the surface temperature of stars is from 2200 K to 50,000 K. The size of a star is related to both its luminosity and its surface temperature, as indicated by the dashed lines. Most main- sequence stars are roughly the same size as the Sun. White dwarfs are about the same size as the Earth, while red g iants can be as big as the Earth’s orbit. The statistical distribution of data on an HR diagram demonstrates that stars fainter than the Sun are far more numerous than those brighter than the Sun. About 90% of stars are main-sequence stars, about 10% are white dwarfs and about 1% are red giants or SUPERGIANTS . The three main groupings on the HR diagram correspond to the three very different stages through which a typical star passes during its life. Computer models reveal how the luminosity and surface temperature of a star change as it evolves. With this information, the path followed by an evolving star can be plotted on an HR diagram.

Part B shows the principal regions of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, with giant stars above the main sequence to the top right, and dwarfs to the lower left. Part C illustrates some of the evolutionary tracks that stars may take as they branch away from the main sequence.

As they evolve, their pre-main-sequence phase is represented on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram as HAYASHI and HENYEY TRACKS . Contracting, pre-main- sequence stars change rapidly as gravitational contraction compresses and heats their cores. When the central tem- perature reaches several million degrees, nuclear FUSION begins, in the form of hydrogen burning, and the evolu- tionary track stops at the main sequence. Main-sequence stars are stable stars, burning hydrogen at their cores. A star will spend most of its life on the main sequence. Pre-main-sequence evolutionary tracks deposit new- born stars on the main sequence in a position consistent with the MASS – LUMINOSITY RELATION , so that the more massive a star is, the brighter it is. Thus, the main sequence is a sequence in mass, as well as temperature and luminosity. These tracks also show that the more mas- sive a star is, the more rapidly it evolves. As a star consumes hydrogen, it gradually becomes slightly brighter and cooler. When the hydrogen supply is exhausted, the star’s core contracts, its atmosphere expands, and it becomes a red giant or supergiant. It evolves off the main sequence at a point called the TURNOFF POINT . As it burns the hydrogen in its shell, it is on the red giant branch. If it is massive enough, the tem- perature of the collapsing core can become hot enough for helium burning to start. When a star is burning helium in its core, it is a HORIZONTAL BRANCH STAR . Between the horizontal branch stars and the red giant branch is a gap. When the evolutionary track of a low- mass star takes it across this region, the star pulsates as an RR LYRAE VARIABLE . This gap is at the lower end of the so- called INSTABILITY STRIP , a vertical region in the middle of the HR diagram where stars are unstable against radial oscillations. When a massive star passes through this region, it pulsates and is called a CEPHEID VARIABLE . The asymptotic giant branch has stars with both h ydrogen and helium shell burning. PLANETARY NEBULAE are ejected at this stage. A star less massive than about 3 solar masses can eject as much as half its mass at the end of its life, producing such a planetary nebula. The exposed, burned-out core of the star then contracts to become a white dwarf. Detailed calculations of this process do indeed produce evolutionary tracks that rapidly take low-mass stars from the red giant region in the upper right of the HR diagram to the white dwarf region in the lower left of the diagram. Massive stars can end their lives in SUPERNOVA explosions, which leave behind NEUTRON STARS or BLACK HOLES . As these are detected at non-visible wavelengths, they are not repre- sented on an HR diagram. Stellar evolution calculations relate the HR diagram to time, and thus these graphs can provide information about the ages of stars. The HR diagram is particularly useful for estimating the age of star clusters. A very young cluster, such as NGC2362, consists primarily of main- sequence stars. However, the more massive a star is, the more rapidly it consumes its core supply of hydrogen to become a red giant. Since the main sequence is a progres- sion in stellar mass, the stars at the upper end of the main sequence are the first to leave. As the cluster ages, the turnoff point for the evolving stars moves back along the main sequence. M67, for example, is an old cluster because only those stars less massive and less luminous than the Sun still remain on the main sequence.

Hess began investigating the phenomenon of a tmospheric ionization by launching electroscopes in high-altitude balloons. Instead of this ionization decreasing with altitude, he found (1912) that it actually increased by a factor of eight in the upper levels of the a tmosphere, suggesting an extraterrestrial source for this radiation, later known as cosmic rays. HET Abbreviation of HOBBY – EBERLY TELESCOPE Hevelius, Johannes (1611–87) German astronomer and instrument-maker, also a wealthy brewer and city magistrate, born in Danzig (modern Gdansk, Poland). In 1641 he built at Danzig what for a time was the world’s leading observatory; called Sternenburg, it was destroyed by fire in 1679. His second wife, Elizabeth Margarethe Hevelius (1646/7–93), assisted him in much of his observational work, and she edited and published his magnum opus, Prodromus astronomiae , published posthumously in 1690. Hevelius was the first astronomer to describe the bright features of the solar photosphere known as faculae, which he found were connected with the formation of sunspots. He also derived an accurate v alue for the Sun’s rotation period. In 1644 he observed the phases of Mercury that Nicholas Copernicus had predicted the planet would show. Hevelius discovered four new comets, and suggested that these objects, which he called ‘pseudo-planetae’, moved about the Sun in parabolic orbits. He was also a skilled observer of the Moon and planets. In Selenographia (1647), the first truly detailed lunar atlas depicting how the appearance of lunar features changed with the Moon’s phases, Hevelius coined the term ‘mare’ to describe the Moon’s dark areas. He measured the heights of lunar mountains, obtaining results more accurate than Galileo’s. His catalogue of 1564 stars and the accompanying Ura- nographia star atlas was based on many years of naked-eye observations with sighting instruments similar to those used by Tycho BRAHE ; Hevelius was the last major astronomer not to use a telescope. Hewish, Antony (1924– ) English radio astronomer and recipient, with Martin R YLE , of the 1974 Nobel Prize for Physics for their role in discovering pulsars, and also for their development of the radio-astronomy technique of APERTURE SYNTHESIS . Hewish was part of the team at Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, that mapped the radio sky during the 1950s and 1960s, compiling the Cambridge Catalogues of radio sources. In the 1960s he made extensive studies of radio scintillation, the variation of radio waves’ intensities, quantifying how Earth’s a tmosphere, solar radiation and even the interstellar medium all contribute to this effect. Although he received credit for discovering pulsars, it was actually his graduate student Jocelyn BELL BURNELL who first noticed the pulsed emissions. hexahedrite See IRON METEORITE Hey, (James) Stanley (1909–2000) British physicist and radar pioneer whose work during World War II led to the development of modern radio astronomy techniques. In 1942 he investigated interference with England’s defence radar, which many experts thought was ‘jamming’ by the enemy; instead, he discovered that solar radiation w as to blame. In later years Hey studied radio emission from sunspots, as well as variations in the Sun’s overall radio emission. After the war, Hey turned his attention to radio sources outside the Solar System, and was the first to identify the exact location of the Cygnus A radio galaxy.

The highlands have a different composition from the maria ( see MARE ) and appear lighter due to a higher reflectance of sunlight. As the highlands are much older than the maria, they are more deeply cratered. high-redshift quasar Most distant QU ASARS observed, as determined from their REDSHIFTS and the HUBBLE LAW . Quasars are intrinsically so bright that some can be seen out to extremely large distances. Although the distribution of quasars peaks around z = 2.5, many quasars have been detected as far as z ~4.1. These extremely luminous, distant sources are seen as they were several billions of years ago. high-velocity cloud (HVC) Cloud of mostly neutral h ydrogen that is moving 100 to 200 km/s (60–120 mi/s) faster than the expected circular orbital velocity for its distance from the centre of the Galaxy. The clouds are normally only detectable from their radio emissions. The best-known example is an enormous bridge of material between our Galaxy and the MAGELLANIC CLOUDS . Known as the Magellanic Stream, it probably resulted from a close passage of the Magellanic clouds with the Galaxy at some time in the past. Other HVCs may be the result of SUPERNOVA explosions or may be infalling intergalactic material still being accreted by the Galaxy. The origin of most HVCs is not known. high-velocity star Star whose space motion exceeds about 100 km/s (60 mi/s). There are several quite distinct classes. Many nearby Population II stars have high v elocities by virtue of their galactic orbits, which may be neither circular nor close to the galactic plane; the nearby red dwarf binary 61 Cygni is an example. R UNAWAY STARS are young massive O or B stars moving at very high velocities, thought to have been ejected from binary systems or clusters. Somewhat older A stars of high v elocity include many binary systems, making them less likely to have been ejected from clusters, and have orbits that inhabit a thick disk. They may trace the remnants of smaller galaxies that have merged with the Milky Way and not yet settled into its thin gas-rich disk. High- v elocity neutron stars originate in the disruption of a binary during a supernova explosion; asymmetric explosions can impart a velocity ‘kick’. Hill, George William (1838–1914) American mathematician who applied his skills to celestial mechanics. He is most famous for his work on lunar theory, a working out of the Moon’s complex motion and the perturbations exerted upon it.

Hipparchus Lunar crater (6ºS 5ºE), 135 km (84 mi) in diameter, with rim components reaching 1220 m (4000 ft) above its floor. An ancient crater, Hipparchus has been severely modified by meteorite erosion. Indeed, this erosion has removed all remnants of its ejecta blanket and has brought its walls to near level with the surrounding surface. The floor of Hipparchus is relatively smooth because of lava flooding. Hipparchus of Nicea ( c .190–120 BC ) Greek astronomer, geographer and mathematician who made observations from Nicea (in what is now modern T urkey), Alexandria, Egypt and the Greek island of Rhodes. Little is known of his life, and the only book of his to survive is a commentary on the work of ARATUS . Most information about him comes from Ptolemy’s ALMAGEST , from which it is clear that Hipparchus was the g reatest observational astronomer of antiquity. He is best known for his discovery of the PRECESSION OF THE EQUINOXES . Hipparchus measured the length of the TROPICAL YEAR to within 6 \u0001 \u0002 minutes; this allowed him to compare the dates of the equinoxes with the dates given by ARISTARCHUS of Samos and other earlier astronomers, and he found that the equinoxes had moved westwards around the ecliptic. His catalogue of some 850 stars – believed by some scholars to form the basis of the catalogue in the Almagest – was the first to classify stars by their apparent visual magnitudes. Hipparchus developed mathematical models describ- ing the apparent motion of the Sun and Moon, introduc- ing epicycles, basing his work on his own and older Babylonian observations. He determined the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon from observations of solar and lunar eclipses. Finding the Sun’s parallax too small to measure, he assumed a value based on the accu- racy of his observing equipment. This was almost five times too large, giving a value for the Sun’s distance almost five times too small, and a figure for the Sun’s diameter less than one-sixteenth of the true value, but these results were a vast improvement on previous esti- mates. Hipparchus’ calculations of the Moon’s average distance as 59–67 Earth radii (modern value 60.4) and its diameter as 0.33 times the Earth’s (modern value 0.27) w ere more accurate.

The launch in 1989 was only partially successful, placing Hipparcos in a highly elliptical orbit instead of the intended geostationary orbit. However, the satellite was able to meet its scientific objectives before operations ended in 1993 August. During systematic scanning of the sky, Hipparcos used direct triangulation to measure the relative positions, annual PROPER MOTIONS and TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX - ES of some 120,000 selected stars down to 11th magni- tude – nearly every star within 250 l.y. of Earth. The satellite’s payload was a telescope that could view simultaneously in two directions 58º apart. The satellite rotated at approximately 12 revolutions per day about an axis perpendicular to the two fields of view. The direction of this axis of rotation was changed slowly so that the whole sky was scanned many times during the mission. The results were eventually published in 1997 as the HIPPARCOS CATALOGUE . The Hipparcos survey more than doubled the number of known variable stars and discovered ov er 10,000 new binary or multiple star systems. It also led to the creation of the first accurate three-dimensional pic- ture of the bright stars in our stellar neighbourhood. Dis- tance measurements of CEPHEID VARIABLE stars indicated that the Universe must be 10% older than previously thought. Other measurements showed that the Milky Way is slightly warped and in the process of changing shape. Hipparcos Catalogue (HIP) Catalogue, published in both paper and electronic forms, compiled from data gathered by the HIPPARCOS astrometry satellite. It lists 118,218 selected stars down to mag. 12.4 with highly accurate positions (to around 0 \u0001 .001), parallaxes, proper motions and photometry. The T ycho Catalogue (TYC) gi v es less accurate positions (to around 0 \u0001 .05) but lists 1,058,332 stars to mag. 11.5 with two-colour photometric measurements. The catalogue was published in 1997; it was followed in 2000 by the T ycho- 2 Catalogue , which made use of data from the Astrographic Catalogue ( see CARTE DU CIEL ) to derive very accurate proper motions. Hirayama family Group of ASTEROIDS characterized by having closely similar orbital elements. The existence of such families was pointed out by Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama (1874–1943) in 1928. About a hundred such families are now recognized, each being named usually after its largest member. Some of the more populous families may have hundreds of constituents. About half of all MAIN - BELT ASTEROIDS are members of one Hirayama family or another. F our of the main families are the FLORA , Eos, Themis and Koronis groups. The fact that in many such families the members have similar spectral reflectivities suggests that they originated through the collisional break up of a larger progenitor. GASPRA , for example, is a member of the Flora family, and images of it are indicative of its liberation as an independent body in the astronomically recent past (during the last hundreds of millions of years as opposed to billions). Such disintegrations are known to have occurred from other lines of evidence; for example iron meteorites must once have been part of much larger bodies, which were sufficiently massive for internal heating to have occurred and caused the liquefaction and chemical fractionation that is obvious from the meteorites’ appearance. Similarly, the family associated with VESTA appears to be the source of several distinct meteorite types, in that the reflectivities of these meteorites are matched by the surface regions of that asteroid and its cohorts. Bands of INTERPLANETARY DUST believed to be associated with certain families may be debris produced by collisions in relatively recent times (within the past few million years). Other types of asteroid family may be recognized on the basis of orbital similarity, but with that similarity having been produced by dynamical segregation and accumulation around certain sets of orbital parameters, rather than by a common genesis. The TROJAN ASTEROIDS represent an obvious example, another being the HILDA ASTEROIDS ; other groupings include the HUNGARIA ASTEROIDS . HI region Interstellar gas cloud in which the hydrogen is in the form of neutral atoms. The name derives from the convention whereby ionized atoms are labelled with a Roman numeral one larger than the number of electrons lost: ionized hydrogen is HII ( see HII REGION ) and neutral h ydrogen is therefore HI. The sizes of HI regions can vary considerably, but typically they are 10 to 20 l.y. across and have a mass of 10 to 100 solar masses. Their temperature is around 100 K, and the particle density around 10 7 m \u0002 3 (ten times denser than the average for INTERSTELLAR MATTER ). The density is too low for molecular hydrogen to form in significant quantities, and any that did form w ould soon be dissociated by stellar radiation. HI regions do not emit visible radiation, but they can be detected from their TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE radio emissions. Large radio telescopes can thus detect HI regions even in distant galaxies. Different kinds of galaxy contain different proportions of HI. Our own Galaxy and other spiral or irregular galaxies contain an appreciable fraction of their total mass in HI. Elliptical galaxies contain no (or extremely little) detectable HI. In our Galaxy, HI clouds are heavily concentrated to a flattened disk in which a spiral pattern occurs. Spiral arms are made conspicuous, even in very distant galaxies, by the groups of hot, high mass, blue stars lying along the arms, like pearls on a string. These groups contain stars that have formed recently from the HI clouds. Not all HI clouds are capable of forming stars; only the densest ones that also contain molecular cores can do so ( see GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUDS ). A number of HI clouds lie out of the galactic plane and are very diffuse. Even dense hydro- gen clouds are much more tenuous than the best laborato- ry vacuum achievable on Earth. HII region Interstellar gas cloud in which the hydrogen is in the form of ions ( see STRÖMGREN SPHERE ). The name derives from the notation, HII, used to denote ionized hydr ogen ( see HI REGION ). The hydrogen is ionized by ultraviolet radiation from hot young stars embedded within the region, and the gas is heated to betweeen 8000 and 10,000 K. HII regions are often embedded within HI regions, but have densities 10 to 100,000 times greater than those of the latter. The high temperatures and densities of HII regions mean that the gas pressure inside these regions is far higher than that of the surrounding HI region or interstellar medium. All HII regions are thus increasing in size at expansion velocities of around 10 km/s (6 mi/s). Visible radiation from an HII region results from the RECOMBINATION of ions and electrons, and hot dust causes infrared emission; FREE – FREE TRANSITIONS lead to emission by the region at radio wa v elengths. On images, HII regions often appear red because of the HYDROGEN - ALPHA LINE at 656 nm; H Hipparcos 182 \u0001 Hipparcos Astrometric data from the Hipparcos satellite r evealed warping of the disk of the Galaxy.

Three main classes of HII regions are recognized: ultra-compact HII Regions (UCHIIRs), which are less than about 0.1 l.y. in size; compact HII regions, which are about 1 l.y. across; and classical HII regions, which may be several tens of light-years in size. Giant and supergiant HII regions, with sizes up to several hundred light-years, are found in some external galaxies. UCHIIRs and com- pact HII regions occur around single stars, but the larger classes usually have from a few to 100,000 stars within them. The amount of ionized gas in the cloud ranges from a small fraction of a solar mass to millions of solar masses. The gas density similarly ranges from 10 7 to 10 11 parti- cles m \u0001 3 , with the largest clouds being the least dense. The smaller HII regions are often, but not always, roughly spherical in shape. The larger regions can have very com- plex morphologies arising from the distribution of gas and stars within them. The ORION NEBULA is a good example of a classical HII region. Regions of ionized hydrogen can occur for many rea- sons, such as ultraviolet emission from old hot stars or from nova or supernova explosions, or they may form as a result of high velocity jets impacting the material of the interstellar medium. Conventionally, however, these are not included in the term HII region, but are instead given their own specific names ( see PLANETARY NEBULA , SUPER - NOVA REMNANT and HERBIG – HARO OBJECT ). HII regions are stellar nurseries. The hot stars that ion- ize the gas have recently been formed through gravitation- al collapse within a GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUD . The life of an HII region is only a few million years. The presence of such regions, along with the hot stars, marks out the arms in spiral galaxies. HII complexes also characterize STAR - BURST galaxies, in which high-mass star-forming activity is occurring strongly. HM Nautical Almanac Office Principal organization in the UK for providing astronomical almanacs and other numerical data. With the US NAVAL OBSERVATORY it is responsible for producing The ASTRONOMICAL ALMANAC , The Nautical Almanac and The UK Air Almanac .

Hoba Largest single METEORITE known. Hoba is approximately 3 \u0002 3m (10 \u0002 10 ft) across, and at least 1m (3.3 ft) deep; it is estimated to weigh c .60 tonnes. Hoba is an ataxite IRON METEORITE . It was found in 1920, near Grootfontein, Namibia, where it still lies in the ground, preserved as a national monument. Hobby–Eberly Telescope (HET) Large optical telescope of unusual design at an elevation of 2025 m (6640 ft) on Mount Fowlkes at MCDONALD OBSERVATORY . It is run by a consortium consisting of Penn State University, Stanford University, Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München, and Georg-August Universität Göttingen. With its innovative simple mounting, it was only a fraction of the cost of a conventional 8-metre class telescope. It entered operation in 1997. It is named after William P. Hobby and Robert E. Eberly, American supporters of public education. The HET utilizes a ‘tilted arecibo’ concept: the tele- scope tube is fixed at 55º from the horizontal; the tele- scope itself remains stationary during observations, though the whole structure can rotate through 360º of azimuth on air bearings. This single rotational axis, com- bined with the apparent rotation of the heavens, gives the HET access to 70% of the sky visible from McDonald Observatory over the course of the year. To follow the stars, there is a tracker mounted in the focal plane of the spherical primary mirror; this carries a Spherical Aber- ration Corrector (SAC). The mirror consists of 91 identical segments forming a hexagon 10 \u0002 11 m (33 \u0002 36 ft) in size. The working aperture of 9.2 m (30 ft), determined by the optics of the SAC, is smaller than the primary mirror to allow the beam to track across the mirror during observation. An imager and a spectrograph are mounted at the prime focus, while larger spectrographs are mounted below the telescope and connected by fibre-optic feeds. Hoffleit, (Ellen) Dorrit (1907– ) Pioneering American woman variable-star astronomer and compiler of the Yale BRIGHT STAR CATALOGUE . Working at Harvard College Observatory, she discovered over a thousand variable stars, mostly in the southern sky. Between 1948 and 1956 Hoffleit determined very accurate spectroscopic absolute magnitudes for many southern stars, which allowed other astronomers to map the Milky Way’s large-scale structure. In 1956 she joined Yale University and undertook a thorough revision of the Bright Star Catalogue , first compiled by Frank SCHLESINGER . She has produced three editions of this catalogue, which contains positional, spectral and other basic data for over 9000 stars. Hoffmeister, Cuno (1892–1968) German astronomer, founder, and for 42 years the director, of the Sonneberg Observatory, who specialized in variable stars. Using a battery of fourteen small cameras, he secured over 100,000 photographic plates of the night sky. His careful examination of these plates resulted in the discovery of over 10,000 new variables. Hoffmeister also conducted long-term visual meteor counts to refine the positions of shower radiants and the parameters of meteor streams. He made detailed studies of the zodiacal light and gegenschein.

From 1931 to 1935, she used DAO’s 72-inch (1.82-m) reflector to photograph variable stars, work that would lead to the compilation of an important catalogue of those objects. In 1935 the Hoggs moved to David Dunlap Observatory, where Helen used the 74-inch (1.88-m) telescope to discover hundreds of new variable stars. Holden, Edward Singleton (1846–1914) American astronomer, director of Washburn (University of Wisconsin) Observatory (1881–85) and first director of Lick Observatory (1888–97).

Hooker Telescope Name of the 100-inch (2.5-m) telescope at MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY , immortalized in the 1920s as the instrument with which Edwin HUBBLE discovered the distance scale of the Universe. It is named after the financier John D. Hooker (1837–1910), who was persuaded by George Ellery HALE to fund its construction. It was completed in 1917, and was the largest reflector in the world until the HALE TELESCOPE became operational in 1948. The telescope can be used in various optical configurations. The Hooker Telescope is the work of George W. RITCHEY , the American optician who pioneered the devel- opment of large telescope optics in the early 20th century. The 4.5-tonne mirror blank was cast in 1908, and two years later Ritchey began the five-year task of polishing and figuring it. The completed instrument was first turned on the sky in 1917. It soon made history when, in 1920, Francis G. PEASE and John A. ANDERSON used the STELLAR INTERFEROMETER built and fitted to the 100-inch by Albert Abraham Michelson (1852–1931) to make the first measurements of star diameters. After a long and illustrious career the telescope was declared inactive in 1986, but in 1994 it was reinstated as a research instrument, and underwent major upgrades to its control systems, including a state-of-the-art ADAPTIVE OPTICS system.

He realized that the nucleus was the active part of a comet, and in 1669 made the first serious attempts to measure the parallax of a star, \u0006 Draconis.

Hertzsprung–Russell diagrams of GLOBULAR CLUS - TERS show differences in the form of their horizontal branches from cluster to cluster.

Altitude is the angular distance of a celestial body above an observer’s horizon. It is measured vertically from 0º at the horizon, along the GREAT CIRCLE passing through the object, to a maximum of 90º at the ZENITH . Azimuth is the angular distance of an object measured w estwards along the horizon, with north as the zero point, to the vertical circle (meridian) running through the object. Horologium See feature article Horrocks, Jeremiah (1619–42) English astronomer, the first to build significantly on the work of Galileo and J ohannes Kepler. Born at Toxteth, Liverpool, into a farming family, he studied at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, between 1632 and 1635, where he discovered the errors in existing planetary tables, and set about correcting them from instruments of his own devising, including an ‘astronomical radius’, a solar projector and a small telescope. In 1636 he became acquainted with William CRABTREE of Salford, and soon afterwards William GASCOIGNE of Leeds and Christopher Towneley (1604–74). Horrocks’ surviving writings abound with references to the importance of primary observation. In 1637 he and Crabtree observed the sudden occultation of the stars of the Pleiades by the Moon, which led him to believe that the Moon must be airless. By 1638 he had demonstrated that the lunar orbit is a Keplerian ellipse, and had measured the changing angular diameters of the Sun and Moon, matching them with elliptical orbits. His measurement of the solar parallax gave a Sun–Earth distance of around 100 million km (about 60 million mi), which would remain the best estimate for many years. His successful prediction and observation of the transit of Venus on 1639 November 24 won him posthumous immortality. From it, Horrocks calculated the angular diameter and parallax of Venus and suggested that they were consistent with a Keplerian orbit.

Dark matter was postulated to be responsible for closing the universe ( see CLOSED UNIVERSE ) and for explaining galaxy formation. Hot dark matter could consist of massive neutrinos moving near the speed of light (hence the term hot). However, predictions for galaxy formation assuming the presence of hot dark matter do not seem to agree with current observations. hour angle (HA) Measure of the elapsed SIDEREAL TIME since a given celestial object last crossed the observer’s meridian. Hour angle is also a measure of the angle between the HOUR CIRCLE passing through a celestial body and the observer’s local CELESTIAL MERIDIAN , measured westwards from the meridian. hour circle Any circle on the CELESTIAL SPHERE that passes through both CELESTIAL POLES , perpendicular to the CELESTIAL EQUATOR . Each half of an hour circle, taken from pole to pole, is a line of constant RIGHT ASCENSION , and the DECLINATION of a celestial object is measured along its hour circle. The zero hour circle coincides with the observer’s meridian.

In 1957 he co-authored, with Margaret and Geoffrey BURBIDGE and William FOWLER , the seminal paper ‘Synthesis of the Elements in Stars’. Dubbed ‘B 2 FH’ for the initials of its authors’ surnames, this paper describes how stars synthesize chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. Hoyle’s major contribution to this theory of stellar nucleosynthesis was his prediction of an excited state of the 12 C nucleus. In 1948, with Hermann BONDI and Thomas GOLD , Hoyle conceived a cosmological theory describing the Universe as flat space expanding at a constant rate, the expansion being balanced by the continuous creation of matter so that its mean density remains unchanged. This steady-state theory was proposed as an alternative to the BIG BANG , a term Hoyle coined to poke fun at the model accepted by most cosmologists. Hoyle later helped Geoffrey Burbidge to develop a ‘quasi-steady-state theory’, which, unlike the original ver- sion, accounts for the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND radiation. This theory suggests that the isotope 4 He is produced, not in the Big Bang, but by stellar hydrogen bu r ning, as are the isotopes 2 H (deuterium), 3 He, 6 Li, 7 Li, 9 Be, 10 B and 11 B. Hoyle modelled the collapse of interstellar dust clouds to form stars, and in the 1940s he was the first to describe mathematically the process of accretion, by which stars accumulate INTERSTELLAR MATTER . He suggested that the dust clouds are composed of inorganic carbon graphite g rains or organic forms of carbon, the latter forms possi- bly imported to Earth with other organic molecules where they formed the building blocks of life, thus reviving the P ANSPERMIA theory. With this and other non-mainstream theories, Hoyle often courted controversy. Fo r many years Hoyle was Plumian Professor of Astronomy at Cambridge University, founding its Insti- tute of Theoretical Astronomy (1966).

Hubble, Edwin Powell (1889–1953) American astronomer who proved that the spiral ‘nebulae’ were galaxies lying far beyond our own Milky Way, established a widely used scheme for the classification of galaxies, and who derived the velocity–distance relation for these objects, thus allowing the scale of the Universe to be reckoned for the first time. It is difficult to overstate Hubble’s impact on observational cosmology; it has been said that what Nicholas Copernicus did for the Solar System, and William Herschel did for the Galaxy, so Hubble did for the Universe. A native of Missouri, Hubble worked briefly (1914–17) as a research assistant at Yerkes Observatory, then, following a stint in the United States Infantry from 1917 to 1919, he joined the staff of MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY , where he remained for the rest of his career. He was also involved with the construction of the 200-inch (5-m) HALE TELESCOPE at P alomar Observato- ry , which he used in his latter researches (1948–53). For most of his career, Hubble used Mount Wilson’s 60-inch (1.5-m) and 100-inch (2.5-m) reflecting telescopes to study CEPHEID VARIABLES in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), M33 and NGC 6822, the distance and nature of which were the subjects of the so-called GREAT DEBATE in 1920. From 1925 to 1929 he published three important papers showing that these nebulae were galaxies lying at distances much greater than any object in the Milky Way, confirming the ‘island universe’ model of Heber CURTIS . In 1932 he discovered the first globular clusters outside the Milky Way, in M31. Extending the earlier work of Vesto M. SLIPHER , Hub- ble measured the spectral REDSHIFTS of 46 galaxies, a ttributing the redshifts to a recession of the galaxies and using the results to find their recessional velocities. Com- paring these velocities to the distances of the galaxies, in 1929 he announced what is now called HUBBLE ’ SLAW : the farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is receding. When these two quantities, velocity and distance, were plotted against each other, the result was an almost perfectly lin- ear fit – the slope of the line is the HUBBLE CONSTANT ( H 0 ), and its reciprocal, the Hubble time , is the age of the Universe since the Big Bang. These discoveries provided powerful evidence that the real Universe resembled the kind of expanding universe derived theoretically by Albert EINSTEIN and Willem DE SITTER . From 1929 to 1936, Hubble and his assistant, Milton HUMASON , published a series of studies showing conclu- sively that for velocities of recession up to 40,000 km/s (25,000 mi/s), the velocity–distance relation holds true. The two astronomers also invented the first (1925) sys- tematic scheme for the classification of galaxies (now called the HUBBLE CLASSIFICATION ) based on their mor- phologies, labelling these objects as elliptical, ‘normal’ spi- ral or barred spiral galaxies, which they further divided into subtypes. Hubble believed that his scheme indicated an evolutionary sequence for galaxies, from ellipticals to spirals, though this is now known not to be the case. Hubble’s surveys of bright galaxies, carried out in the 1930s and 1940s, showed them to be distributed isotropi- cally on the largest scales of the Universe. On more local scales, galaxies were often found in clusters composed mostly of elliptical galaxies – Hubble was the first to mea- sure accurately the surface brightness profiles of ellipticals. His counts of galaxies confirmed that they are compara- tively scarce in the ZONE OF AVOIDANCE along the plane of the Milky Way, where they are obscured by our Galaxy’s disk of dust and gas. Hubble’s studies of the Milky Way’s spiral arms (1935–43) provided the first strong evidence that they ‘trail’ as the Galaxy rotates, instead of opening outwards ‘ahead’ of the galactic rotation, as some H HR diagram 186 \u0001 Hubble classification A useful way of describing galaxy shapes, the Hubble classification splits these into three main classes.

Three decades after his death, the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST) was named to honour him. Hubble classification System for classifying GALAXIES according to their shape on photographs; it was introduced by Edwin HUBBLE in 1925, with extensions and revisions by several later workers, including Allan SANDAGE , Gerard DE VAUCOULEURS , and Sidney Van den Bergh (1929– ). ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES are denoted E with a numeral describing the apparent shape, from E0 for a circular image, through E5 for an image with an axial ratio of 2, to the most flattened ellipticals at E7. Ordinary (nonbarred) SPIRAL GALAXIES are denoted S with a letter a,b,c,d to indicate a stage along the TUNING - FORK DIAGRAM . Sa galaxies have large and bright central bulges, with tightly w ound arms. Sc galaxies have small and faint bulges, with prominent and loosely wound arms. Intermediate types Sab and Sbc can also be used. A parallel sequence of BARRED SPIRALS includes SBa, SBb and SBc. IRREGULAR GALAXIES are denoted Irr or simply I. Originally two types, Irr I and Irr II, were used, but Irr II galaxies appear to be temporary results of gravitational collisions and not a distinct kind of galaxy. The extension to the system by de V aucouleurs recognized inner ring-like or spiral-shaped structures, as well as external rings. The van den Bergh classification added the use of the spiral pattern as a rough indicator of galaxy luminosity. While the Hubble classification was originally designed to be descriptive, and based on blue-light photographs of a particular exposure range, it has retained enormous util- ity because these designations correlate well with physical- ly interesting galaxy properties. Stellar and gas content and star formation rate, for example, change systematical- ly between Hubble types. Hubble constant P arameter in the HUBBLE LAW that relates the velocity of a galaxy to its redshift. In GENERAL RELATIVITY , it is the rate at which the scale size ( R ) of the Universe is changing with time. It is also the rate at which distances between all ‘co-moving’ objects – that is, those objects with no individual motion relative to the fabric of space – are increasing. The units for the Hubble constant are such that its inverse is a time, which can ve ry loosely be thought of as an ‘age’ for the Universe. More usually, however, the units employed are kilometres per second per megaparsec since, for small redshifts, galaxy recession velocities increase by this amount for each megaparsec of distance. The Hubble constant is normally designated H 0 , the zero subscript specifying that it is the expansion rate at the present epoch that is meant. The relative expansion rate changes with time and the Hubble parameter and its rate of change are related to the deceleration parameter, q 0 , by H 0 = . R / R q 0 = ̈ R /( RH 0 2 ) both values being calculated for the present epoch. The search for accurate values for H 0 and q 0 has been the driving force behind much of observational cosmolo- gy in the last 80 years. Many different methods of obtain- ing values for H 0 have been devised. But they all have in common redshift and distance measurements of a set of similar objects carefully chosen to eliminate selection and measurement bias to the greatest extent possible. A key project for the Hubble Space Telescope was the task of deriving an accurate value for the Hubble constant. After many years of work, the best value of H 0 av ailable at pre- sent from the Space Telescope Key Project is 68 \u0001 6.0 km per second per megaparsec.

In 1998 the Hubble Deep Field South (HDF-S) was imaged: a 2 \u0002 sample of a region in the constellation Tucana. Both fields show over 2000 galaxies, including some of the most distant – and thus the youngest – ever imaged.

It is a straight line, demonstrating the linear relation between redshift and distance, as embodied in the HUBBLE LAW . Hubble law Law proposed by Edwin HUBBLE in his landmark paper of 1929 claiming a linear relation between the distance of galaxies from us and their v elocity of recession, deduced from the redshift in their spectra. The law can be stated as: v = H 0 d where v is the radial velocity of a galaxy, d is the distance to the galaxy and H 0 is a constant now known as the HUB - BLE CONSTANT . This linear velocity–distance relation could be readily explained if the Universe as described by general relativity were expanding.

It is equipped with two high-gain antennae, which enable it to transmit direct to the ground using a tracking and data relay satellite system, and two low-gain antennae. HST has a data management system and a fine-pointing system, which allows it to be aimed and remain locked on to any specific target to within 0 \u0001 .01. The optical telescope assembly is configured in such a way that the telescope is the equivalent of 57.6 m (189 ft) long, but compacted to 6.4 m (21 ft). Light entering the aperture door travels down the tube on to a 2.4-m (94-in) primary mirror and is reflected on to a secondary mirror 0.3 m (12 in) in diameter, where it is reflected through a hole in the centre of the primary mirror on to the focal plane. HST’s va r ious science instruments then receive the light. HST was originally equipped with a Faint Object Camera, Wide-Field/Planetary Camera (WFPC), God- dard High-Resolution Spectrograph (GHRS), Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS), High Speed Photometer (HSP) and Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS). Once the tele- scope had reached orbit, and despite the fact that some good images of the Universe were taken, it soon became clear that the primary mirror was suffering from SPHERI - CAL ABERRATION , which apparently arose during manu- facture. The Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) unit was flown to the HST aboard Space Shuttle STS 61 in 1993 December and fixed inside the telescope during one of a series of five spacewalks. The dual teams of astronauts also replaced a solar panel, repaired electronics, installed a new computer processor, replaced the WFPC with a new unit, installed magnetometers, removed the HSP and installed a redun- dancy kit for the GHRS. The results of installing COSTAR were startling: HST images were now truly spectacular and the telescope immediately caught the imagination of the public worldwide. Another planned HST servicing mission by Shuttle astronauts was launched in 1997 February. The STS 82 Discovery crew made comprehensive changes to Hubble’s suite of instruments and conducted routine spacewalk ser- vicing. The GHRS and FOS were removed and replaced with a Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and a com- bined Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spec- trometer. The astronauts replaced an FGS and other equipment, installed an optical electronics enhancement kit, and changed the HST stabilization and fine-pointing reaction wheel assemblies. Other work included the laying of new thermal insulation blankets. Hubble worked on, entering its tenth year of service when it was time to launch a new Shuttle servicing mis- sion. This was planned originally for 2000 but when gyro- scopes on the telescope failed to a critical level, the mission was brought forward to 1999 December and split into two, with the second half of the mission being shifted to 2001.

Huggins, William (1824–1910) English amateur astrophysicist and pioneer of astronomical spectroscopy. He used an inheritance to build an observatory at Tulse Hill, south London with a 12-ft (3.7-m) dome, equipped with a 5-inch (130-mm) equatorial by John DOLLOND , and a separate transit telescope room. In 1858 he acquired an 8-inch (200-mm) refractor with an objective by ALVAN CLARK & SONS . Huggins became interested in astronomical spectroscopy after learning of Gustav KIRCHHOFF ’s spectroscopic investigations of the Sun. With his neighbour, William Allen Miller (1817–70), professor of chemistry at King’s College, Huggins used two dense flint glass prisms to construct a new instrument, the stellar SPECTROSCOPE , which they attached to the Clark refractor. To compare stellar spectra with the spectral lines produced by known chemical elements, Huggins equipped his observatory with batteries, Bunsen burners and other chemical apparatus, making it unlike any other astronomical observatory then in existence. By 1863 Huggins and Miller had published their first observations of stellar spectra. The next year, Huggins found that some nebulae displayed monochromatic spec- tra typical of gases, whereas the ‘spiral nebulae’ showed continuum, stellar-type spectra. He concluded that, con- trary to what was thought at the time, not all nebulae were aggregations of stars too faint to be resolved. In 1866 he w as the first to examine the spectrum of a nova, which displayed a series of bright hydrogen lines produced by the very hot gaseous emissions typical of these objects. In 1868 he made the first detailed spectroscopic investiga- tion of a comet, confirming the bright C 2 ‘Swan bands’. That same year, Huggins and Miller made the first stellar RADIAL VELOCITY measurement, obtaining a value of 47 km/s (29 mi/s) for Sirius.

Lady Margaret Lindsay Huggins (1848–1915) collabo- rated with her husband for 35 years. As early as 1863, Huggins had photographed the spectra of Sirius and Capella, but was frustrated by the impracticalities of the ‘wet collodion’ plates then available. In 1876 he pho- tographed the spectrum of Vega on a gelatine dry plate, the first such application by an astronomer. The dry plates allowed longer exposures and thus fainter details could be captured, including features in the near-ultravio- let part of the spectrum. Over the next 30 years, Huggins obtained numerous photographic spectra proving that many of the chemical elements known on Earth (for example, hydrogen, calcium, sodium and iron) are also present in stars and nebulae. Hulse, Russell Alan (1950– ) and T aylor, Joseph Hooton, Jr (1941– ) American physicists whose 1974 discovery of the first binary pulsar provided strong evidence for the gravitational waves predicted by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Using Arecibo Observatory’s 305-m (1000-ft) radio telescope, they found a pulsar designated PSR 1913+16, a neutron star of 1 solar mass and diameter 10 km (6 mi), with a close, equally massive companion. Observations showed that this exotic stellar system has a decaying orbit, and Hulse and Taylor deduced that the binary pulsar is losing energy by emitting gravity waves. For their discovery they received the 1993 Nobel Prize for Physics. Hulst, Hendrik Christoffel van de (1918–2000) Dutch physicist and pioneer radio astronomer who in 1944 predicted that interstellar HI regions (gas clouds composed of neutral hydrogen) emit radio waves at a wa v elength of 21 cm. Radio studies of the Milky Way (and other galaxies) by observing the 21-cm emission, first done by Edward Mills Purcell (1912–97) and Harold Irving Ewen (1922– ) in 1951, have allowed galactic structure to be mapped more accurately than by using optical methods alone. Van de Hulst also researched the nature of the solar corona and the interstellar medium. Humason, Milton Lasalle (1891–1972) American astronomer who made many of the earliest redshift measurements of galaxies. He had no formal training, and was at first a mule driver and janitor at MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY , but in 1917 became a night assistant on the 60-inch (1.5-m) telescope there, working under George Ellery HALE . In early work, Humason became an expert observer and was Edwin HUBBLE ’s chief assistant, measuring the redshifts for many ‘nebulae’ and helping to show that they were actually galaxies similar to but far beyond the Milky Way. This work, begun in 1928, led to the discovery that the Universe is expanding. Over the next three decades, Humason collaborated with astronomers such as Allan SANDAGE , using the largest telescopes in the world – the 100-inch (2.5-m) at Mount Wilson and the 200-inch (5-m) at Mount Palomar – to measure the redshifts of hundreds of fainter, more distant galaxies. The results of this work, published in 1956, showed that Hubble’s law was valid out to a recessional velocity of 60,000 km/s (37,000 mi/s). Humorum, Mare (Sea of Humours) Lunar lava plain located in the south-west quadrant of the Moon.

Huygenian eyepiece Basic EYEPIECE consisting of two simple plano-convex elements, commonly used on small refractors. The eye relief is good, the angular field of view is large and the eyepiece is relatively free from CHROMATIC ABERRATION . It is named after Christiaan and Constantijn HUYGENS , who invented it in 1703. Huygens, Christiaan (1629–95) Dutch physicist and astronomer, born into a prominent family in The Hague. After studying mathematics and law at the universities of Leiden and Breda, Huygens worked at the Bibliothèque Royale in Paris (1666-81), before returning to The Hague. He and his brother Constantijn Huygens (1628–97) became skilled opticians and telescope- makers, designing the achromatic HUYGENIAN EYEPIECE . Christiaan Huygens’ first telescope, which he made himself, had a focal length of 3.5 m (11.5 ft). He used it in 1655 to discover TITAN , determining that this satellite revolved about Saturn in 16 days. With a better instrument of 7-m (23-ft) focal length, Huygens made observations of Saturn’s rings that were detailed enough for him to deduce their true nature. GALILEO had seen these changing features as lobes or ‘arms’, but Huygens correctly described them as a single, thin ring system, detached from Saturn’s globe, and pub- lished his results in Systema saturnium (1659). Huygens also made many fundamental contributions to physics that are relevant to astronomy. He explained the optical phenomena of refraction and reflection, and was the first to describe the wave nature of light in his magnum opus, Tr aité de la lumière (1678). He derived the formula F = mv 2 / r to describe centrifugal force. In 1656 he patent- ed the first pendulum clock, which would prove useful in astronomical timekeeping and for finding longitude at sea.

Hyades Second nearest OPEN CLUSTER to the Sun. The Hyades has more than 200 member stars, most of which lie within a distance of 20 l.y. It covers an area of about 6º in the constellation of TAURUS . The brightest stars, together with Aldebaran, which is a foreground star and not a member of the cluster, form a distinctive V shape. Recognized since antiquity, and even mentioned in Homer’s Iliad , the Hyades derived its name from a group of daughters of Atlas and Aethra, half-sisters of the PLEIADES . The cluster is about 600 million years old. In the 19th century, from studies of stellar PROPER MOTIONS , it was realized that the Hyades cluster moves in a general south-easterly direction, together with numerous other stars in the surrounding parts of the sky, in what is called the Taurus stream. Refined proper motion mea- surements subsequently revealed that the Hyades shares a common motion, to within very narrow limits, with an appreciable number of stars in its vicinity. This cluster was designated the Taurus moving cluster; the name Hyades was often used to denote the central denser clustering, which includes the original stars. Today the name Hyades is generally used for the whole cluster, and individual members are sometimes termed Hyads. The distance to the Hyades has been determined in several ways, most recently by the Hipparcos satellite. It lies at a distance of around 151 l.y. This distance can be used to derive absolute magnitudes for cluster members of different kinds, and these values are in turn used as cali- brators for determinations of distances to other stellar aggregates, also containing intrinsically brighter objects. In this way the distance to the Hyades forms one crucial step on the distance ladder of the Universe. The majority of the Hyades cluster member stars belong to the MAIN SEQUENCE , the brightest of these being of spectral type A2. It is from this fact that the age esti- mate is derived, since more massive stars have had time to evolve away from the main sequence. A few such stars are known in the Hyades; they are now yellow GIANT STARS . Also belonging to the cluster are a score of WHITE DWARF stars. A considerable share of the cluster members is believed to consist of BINARY STAR systems. The central concentration, primarily of the more mas- sive stars, indicates that the cluster is nearly relaxed, meaning that the stars have had time to distribute the available kinetic energy equally amongst themselves. The relaxation is, however, not complete, as is seen from the somewhat ragged distribution of stars in the outskirts of the cluster. Due to the close distance of the Hyades, there is no apparent EXTINCTION of light by cosmic dust in front of the stars, and also no dust has been found within the clus- ter.

The comet made a remarkably close passage (0.10 AU) to Earth on March 25, becoming a prominent naked-eye object. Around the time of closest approach, C/1996 B2 Hyakutake was particularly well placed for observers in the northern hemisphere, lying close to Polaris, with a bluish ion tail stretching for up to 70º through the Plough and beyond. Several DISCONNECTION EVENTS were observed in the ion tail. The COMA reached a peak magnitude of \u0001 1. Comet Hyakutake faded somewhat after its near-Earth approach, but brightened again in late April as it neared its May 1 perihelion, 0.23 AU from the Sun. The comet, possibly making its first visit from the OORT CLOUD to the inner Solar System, has an orbital period of about 14,000 years. Around 1996 May 1, the ULYSSES spacecraft recorded anomalies in the SOLAR WIND , later determined to be due to an encounter with the ion tail of Comet Hyakutake. Stretching some 3.8 AU downstream from the nucleus, the comet tail is by far the longest yet found. Hydra See feature article hydrocarbons See INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES hydrogen (symbol H) First and lightest of the chemical elements; it is the most abundant element in the Universe ( see ASTROCHEMISTRY ). Hydrogen-1 (that is, an atom with a single proton as its nucleus with a single electron attached to it) forms almost 100% of the naturally occurring element and has an atomic number of 1 and an atomic mass of 1.007825 amu. Its boiling point is 20.29 K and its melting point is 14.02 K. Hydrogen-2, which is also known as DEUTERIUM , is present on Earth in the proportion of 0.015%. A third isotope, hydrogen-3, also known as tritium, is radioactive, with a half-life of 12.26 years; it is produced in nuclear reactors. The name hydrogen derives from the Greek hydro (water) and genes (forming), and was first used by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier (1743–94). Hydrogen was recognised as a distinct substance, which he called ‘inflammable air’, in 1766 by the English chemist Henry Cavendish (1731–1810). In the visible region, hydrogen produces the familiar BALMER LINE spectrum, which arises from transitions to and from hydrogen’s first excited level. Transitions to and from the ground state produce the ultraviolet LYMAN SERIES ; from higher excited levels, a number of sets of lines in the infrared are produced, starting with the PASCHEN SERIES . Our most familiar contact with hydrogen is in the form of one of its two oxides, water (H 2 O, the other is hydrogen peroxide, H 2 O 2 ), or more rarely as the gas that appears when an acid and a metal react. It is widely used in industry, to make metals and margarine, to fix nitro- gen via the Haber process and, in liquid form, as a con- venient, if hazardous, rocket fuel. Its presence in the molecules of carbohydrates also makes it fundamental to the existence of life. Beyond our immediate environment, the everyday chemistry of hydrogen is of little consequence. Within the H Hyades 190 \u0001 Hyakutake, Comet Reaching a peak brightness of magnitude \u0001 1 in 1996 March, Comet Hyakutake made a close approach to Earth.

At pressures in excess of 10 11 Pa, solid molecular hydrogen starts to behave like a metal, and in this form it is thought to make up the central regions of the Jovian planets. The Milky Way contains huge amounts of non-luminous material that is mostly atomic and mole- cular hydrogen. About half of the mass of our Galaxy is h ydrogen gas and most of the rest is in the form of stars that are again largely hydrogen. Hydrogen between the stars is difficult to detect because it is usually at a low tem- perature, and the lowest energy spectrum lines from both a tomic and molecular hydrogen are FORBIDDEN LINES . Nonetheless, atomic hydrogen is so abundant that the for- bidden emission line at 21 cm (the TWENTY - ONE CEN - TIMETRE LINE ), which results from the electron switching its direction of spin, is easily picked up by radio telescopes. The presence of hydrogen can also be inferred through its association with INTERSTELLAR DUST particles, which absorb light very strongly and are therefore easily detectable. If the hydrogen gas is in the vicinity of hot stars, ultraviolet radiation from those stars will ionize the h ydrogen, producing an HII REGION embedded within the surrounding cold HI REGION .

See also HII REGION hydrogen spectrum Set of EMISSION LINES or ABSORPTION LINES produced by the neutral hydrogen a tom. Hydrogen is surrounded by an infinite number of potential quantized orbits, each with different energy. While the orbital radii increase in size from the ground state orbit ( n = 1) according to n 2 , their energies approach a limit at 13.6 eV above the ground state. Upwards or downwards transitions between the energy states form different series of absorption or emission lines, which are named and lettered according to the lowest state’s number. The lines that arise from, or land on, the g round state ( n = 1) belong to the L YMAN SERIES . The line connecting level 1 to 2 is Lyman \u0001 (at 121.6 nm), 1 to 3 Lyman \u0002 , and so on, with the series converging to the Lyman limit at 91.2 nm. Photons short of the Lyman limit ionize planetary and diffuse nebulae. T ransitions underlain by level 2 are called the BALMER LINES ; they begin at H \u0001 (656.3 nm) and go through H \u0002 , H \u0003 and H \u0004 at 486.1, 434.0 and 410.1 nm, ending at the Balmer limit at 364.6 nm. The infrared P ASCHEN SERIES begins and ends on level 3 (Paschen \u0001 at 1875.1 nm, with the limit at 820.3 nm), the Brackett series on level 4 (from 4.0512 \u0005 m to 1.4584 \u0005 m), the Pfund series on level 5, and the Humphries series on level 6. Radio transitions between high states arise from diffuse and planetary nebulae; the first found was the H109 \u0001 line (level 110–109) at 5007 MHz. Radio lines have been observed nearly to level 300. Any single-electron ion will have a hydrogen-like spec- trum, except that the wavelengths will be shifted down- w ard by Z 2 , where Z is the charge on the nucleus. The same nomenclature is used for such ions. The \u0001 line of the P aschen series of ionized helium falls at 468.6 nm, while its Brackett series (the PICKERING SERIES ) overlays the h ydrogen Balmer series.

Long-period comets enter the inner Solar System in highly elliptical or parabolic orbits, but never h yperbolic.

BOND in the United States and William LASSELL in England. It is dark and reddish and may be a fragment of the interior of a larger satellite destroyed by a collision. Hyperion’s reddish colour and irregular shape could also be consistent with it being perhaps a captured cometary planetesimal or asteroid. Hyperion is one of the few satellites to have an orbital period that is not synchronous with its orbit ( see SYNCHRONOUS RO TA TION ). In fact, as Hyperion progresses round its orbit it tumbles in a seemingly random way, with both its rotation period and the axis of rotation itself changing in a chaotic fashion. This random movement is probably caused by Hyperion’s eccentric orbit and elongated shape, which lead to a strongly variable tidal pull from Saturn.

Velocities at which impacts attain hypervelocity are different for different materials but are typically in the range of 1 to 10 km/s (0.6–6 mi/s). Hypervelocity impact into solid surfaces of planets and satellites results in the formation of an impact CRATER .

It has the remarkable property of appearing much fainter when lying to the east of Saturn in the sky, when we see its leading hemisphere, than when lying to the west, when we see its trailing hemisphere. This observation can be explained by the fact that most of the leading hemisphere has a sooty coating with an albedo of less than 0.1, whereas the trailing hemisphere is relatively clean ice with an albedo of about 0.5. The best VOYA GER images revealed that the trailing hemisphere is heavily cratered, but they were not capable of showing any features in the opposite hemisphere.

IDA Abbreviation of INTERNATIONAL DARK - SKY ASSOCI - A TION igneous rock Rock formed as a result of cooling of molten material. Formerly, rocks formed from the cooling of impact melts were considered to be igneous, but geologists now only consider rocks to be igneous if they are derived from melts formed in the interiors of planets or satellites, usually as a result of decompression of high temperature solid material from the interior, as, for example, in a hot mantle PLUME . Igneous rocks formed on the surface of a planet or satellite, where the melt cools rather fast, are known as volcanic rocks; they typically contain varying proportions of silicate glass together with mineral crystals. Igneous rocks formed at depth in the interior, where the cooling is much slower, are known as plutonic rocks; they are fully crystalline. The principal minerals in igneous rocks are olivine (Mg,Fe) 2 SiO 4 , p yroxene (Mg,Fe,Ca) 2 Si 2 O 6 , feldspars CaAl 2 Si 2 O 8 - (Na,K)AlSi 3 O 8 and quartz SiO 2 .

Ices on the surface of satellites of giant planets, if formed from non- impact melts, should be considered as igneous rocks.

IMAGE Acronym for IMAGER FOR MAGNETOPAUSE TO AU RORA GLOBAL EXPLORATION image intensifier Opto-electronic device for amplifying the brightness of an image. The optical image from a tele- scope is focused on to a photocathode, causing electrons to be liberated, the number of which depends on the intensity of the incoming optical signal and its wavelength. The electrons are accelerated through a potential of around 40 kV and focused by an electric or magnetic field on to a phosphor screen. In addition to being accelerated, the number of electrons may be increased by cascading successive photocathode stages ( see also CASCADE IMAGE TUBE ). A drawback of the system is the slight distortion of the image caused by the electronic focusing. image photon-counting system (IPCS) Electronic imaging device sensitive enough to detect individual pho- tons of light. The system comprises a high-gain IMAGE INTENSIFIER on the front of which is mounted a photo- cathode. A photon falling on the photocathode releases an electron, which produces a cascade of further electrons through the image instensifier, which are detected by a CCD . An important feature of the system is the centre detection logic, which identifies the position on the photo- cathode of each photon event, thus providing increased spatial resolution. As each individual photon is counted, a two-dimensional image is built up in the detector memory. The system is used mainly for high-dispersion SPEC - TROSCOPY of faint objects. image processing Science and practice of extracting information from digital images, or from images on tra- ditional photographic emulsion which have been scanned and converted to digital form. Most profession- al and increasing numbers of amateur astronomers carry out image processing to glean the maximum amount of information contained in their astronomical images. With the ready availability of low-cost computers and CCDS , amateur astronomers are able to apply complex processing routines and produce results that match or exceed those achieved by their professional counterparts only a decade ago. In general terms, image processing is the manipulation of information recorded by the pixels (light-sensitive areas) that make up a modern astronomical detector. The most basic form of image processing is linear scaling , where individual pixels on an image are manipulated to enhance brightness and contrast. This type of processing is useful to remove the effects of LIGHT POLLUTION from the sky background or to enhance faint features such as the arms of spiral galaxies. Another method of boosting the level of information is by the co-addition or stacking of multiple images to improve the SIGNAL - TO - NOISE RATIO of faint astronomical objects. More complex is the use of logarithmic scaling to boost selectively or withhold brightness values on images that contain a wide range of intensity levels. When applied to images of globular clusters, for example, a logarithmic scale extracts information contained in the bright core region, which would normally be overex- posed, yet maintains a high level of detail in the outer reaches of the cluster. In a new technique called digital development processing , a dual routine simultaneous- ly compresses the brightness levels contained in an image and applies UNSHARP MASKING to produce unprecedented levels of detail. Spatial filters are used to sharpen images or to blur as a means of reducing instrument noise or processing arte- facts. Other useful routines include positional translations, notably rotation and scaling of image size. Many astronomers use these functions when combining images for the analysis of transient events, for example in super- nova and asteroid searches. One of the most powerful of all image-processing procedures is the use of fast Fourier transforms . In principle, an image is broken down into a discrete spread of spatial frequencies, to which mathemat- ical operations are applied before the image is reconstruct- ed. By varying the type of operations applied, many different forms of image manipulation are possible. Per- haps the best known of these is deconvolution . Indeed, this method was used to correct images that were taken by the original faulty mirror of the Hubble Space Telescope. For ground-based astronomy, deconvolution is used to improve resolution that has been degraded by viewing through an unsteady atmosphere. Most CCD detectors can only take images in shades of grey, so to build a colour picture it is necessary to take multiple exposures of astronomical objects through differ- ent coloured FILTERS . A common method is to employ red, green and blue filters and to take an exposure through each of these in turn, although other filter combinations are possible. Once the images are stored on a computer, they can be combined and image processing applied to synthesize a colour image and to extract useful scientific information. If care is taken during the combination and processing of these image sets, it is possible to produce IMAGE 194 I \u0001 image processing Raw, digitized images of celestial objects can be manipulated using a range of computer programs to reveal and enhance otherwise invisible details. This pair of images of the galaxy M95 in Leo shows the benefit of contrast enhancement to bring out details of the spiral arms structure. Colour has been added using information from images obtained through separate filters.

The dark spots resulting from the impact of fragments of Comet SHOEMAKER – LEVY 9 on Jupiter in 1994 are examples of transient impact features. inclination (of an orbit) Angle between the plane of an ORBIT of a body and a suitable fixed reference plane. In the Solar System the reference plane is chosen on dynamical considerations. PERTURBATIONS on an orbit cause the LINE OF NODES to regress around the plane of action of the dominant perturbing forces while maintaining constant inclination to this plane, and thus this is the most suitable plane to use as the reference plane. For the planets, the main perturbations come from the other planets; as these all lie close to the ECLIPTIC plane this is the chosen reference plane. For artificial satellites of the Earth and most satellites of other planets, the equatorial bulge (oblateness) of the planet is the dominant perturbation, and so the equatorial plane is chosen as the reference plane. The Moon is relatively ve ry distant from the Earth (in units of Earth radii), and solar perturbations are much larger than the oblateness perturbation, so the ecliptic is chosen as the reference plane. For a few satellites the oblateness and solar perturbations are of similar size, and then the appropriate reference plane, named the Laplacian plane, lies somewhere between the equator and the planet’s orbit plane. This effect was first noted by Pierre LAPLACE in 1805 for the Saturnian satellite Iapetus. The effect also occurs for the Earth’s geostationary satellites, for which the Laplacian plane is inclined at 7º to the equator. F or binary stars the inclination of the orbit is mea- sured relative to the plane at right angles to the line of sight. The angle is zero if the orbit is seen in plan, and 90º if seen in profile. inclination (of a planet’s equator) Angle between the equatorial plane of a planet or satellite and its orbital plane; this is equivalent to the angle between the axis of rotation and the perpendicular to the orbital plane.

Indian astronomy Astronomy as practised in India from ancient times until the 18th century, when Western European astronomy became prevalent. The precise origins of Indian astronomy are unknown, but probably date from the Indus Valley civilization ( c .2000 BC ). Some practical astronomy existed during the Vedic period, which preceded the foundation of the Buddhist and Jain religions around 500 BC . The early Indian calendar was luni-solar, based on 12 lunar months with extra months inserted as necessary to keep it in step with the solar year. The beginning of scientific astronomy in India, based partly on Greek knowledge, dates from about AD 500, during the lifetime of A ̄ RY ABHATA , who introduced the use of sines and other mathematical techniques to the predic- tion of solar, lunar and planetary positions. These he extrapolated from observations made during his own life- time. His and other early astronomical writings were writ- ten in verse and are exceedingly cryptic in form, which led to later scholars doubting they contained anything of sci- entific value (modern opinion has removed this doubt). A ̄ ry abhata believed that the Earth rotated on its axis once a day, but this view was not accepted by later writers. BRAHMAGUPTA w as the other great Indian astronomer of this period, and his works and those of A ̄ ry abhata remained influential. At this time Indian astronomy began to spread to other parts of Asia. From the start of the Moghul period in the 16th century, Islamic astronomy gained influence. The Moghul ruler Jai Singh II (1688–1743) had a special interest in Islamic astronomical knowledge.

Inertia is quantified by the MASS of the body. See also NEWTON ’ SL AW SO FM O TION inferior conjunction Alignment of an inferior planet between the Earth and the Sun. If the alignment takes place at a favourable node, then the inferior planet may be seen to transit the Sun’s disk. CONJUNCTION occurs when two bodies have the same celestial longitude as viewed from the Earth. For an inferior planet, this can also occur when it is on the far side of the Sun to the Earth, at which point it is said to be at SUPERIOR CONJUNCTION . Because of the inclination of the orbits of Mercury and Venus to the ecliptic, they rarely transit the Sun’s disk at inferior conjunction, instead passing either north or south. See diagram at CONJUNCTION inferior planet Planet with an orbit that lies closer to the Sun than does the orbit of the Earth; the inferior planets are MERCURY and VENUS . Since both planets’ orbits are within that of the Earth, they do not appear far from the Sun in the sky and are, therefore, best observed as early morning or early evening objects. Again, because of their orbital positions, both planets display distinctive phases like those of the Moon. infinite Universe, idea of Concept of a cosmos with no bounds. Since ancient Greek times, astronomers had generally considered the planetary Universe to be enclosed within a sphere of fixed stars. By the 15th century AD , however, some scientific thinkers within the Catholic Church, such as Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa (1401–64), w ere coming to argue that there was no reason why an infinite, all-powerful God should not have created an infinite Universe, containing a multitude of stars and planets. But it was the implications of the COPERNICAN SYSTEM after 1543 that re-opened the debate about infinity, for if the Earth and planets were revolving around the Sun, why could not other stars also have planets rotating around them? In 1576, indeed, the English Copernican Thomas DIGGES spoke of the starry ‘sphere’ as extending ‘infinitely’ into space. Yet all of this speculation about an infinite Universe suddenly acquired a physical ground in 1610, when GALILEO resolved the Milky Way into individual stars with his telescope. Thereafter, every increase in telescopic power revealed yet more dim stars, creating the impression that our Sun was b ut one star in an infinite three-dimensional Universe. In 1695, moreover, Christiaan and Constantijn HUYGENS even wondered whether intelligent creatures in space were looking at us with powerful telescopes! By the 1780s William HERSCHEL realized, from the then known velocity of light, that when we look into deep space we look into ‘times past’. By Herschel’s time, however, extensive telescopic observation had confirmed that the Universe appeared to be infinite, and after about 1950, that it was also expanding. See also COSMOLOGY ; OLBERS ’ P ARADOX ; PERFECT COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE inflation F aster-than-light expansion of the universe ve ry early in its evolution. The BIG BANG theory had several problems, specifically the horizon problem and the flatness problem. The horizon problem occurred because measurements of the background temperature from every direction are nearly identical, but these regions of the Universe had to be out of causal contact, and therefore would not be expected to have identical temperatures. The flatness problem arose because the background radiation implied a critical density very close to one, and thus at early times in the universe the density had to be very close to one. The inflationary model of Alan Guth proposed that at approximately 10 \u0002 35 s after the Big Bang the universe expanded exponentially for about 10 \u0002 24 s and increased in size by a factor of 10 50 . The energy to drive this expansion came from the condensation HIGGS FIELD as the temperature of the universe fell below a critical value. This idea solved the horizon problem by assuming that the opposite sides of the universe were in causal contact before inflation, but w ere propelled out of causal contact by the inflationary expansion. It also solved the flatness problem by decreasing our view of the universe to a small portion so that it would appear to be flat, even if the entire universe w ere generally not flat. Inflation has been refined and survived a number of observational tests, and is now on a solid theoretical and observational footing. Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) International project involving the USA, the Netherlands and the UK. Its main objective was to make the first all- sky infrared survey from space, searching for objects with temperatures between 10 and a few hundred kelvin. Its 60-cm (23-in.) reflecting telescope focused incoming radiation on to an array of 64 semiconductor detectors, which were cooled to 1.8 K by liquid helium. IRAS was launched by a DELTA rocket from Vanden- berg Air Force Base, California, on 1983 January 26. It w as placed in a 900-km (560-mi) Sun-synchronous, cir- cular orbit inclined at 99° to the equator. During the main survey in 1983, between early Febru- ary and the end of August, most of the sky was observed twice. A second sky survey began in September and con- tinued until the helium coolant ran out on 1983 Novem- ber 22.

IRAS also studied the galactic centre in great detail. Beyond the Milky Way, IRAS observed that many galaxies are powerful emitters of infrared radiation and some of these, the STARBURST GALAXIES , emit much more infrared than visible light. See also INFRARED ASTRONOMY infrared astronomy Study of astronomical objects at infrared wavelengths. INFRARED RADIATION penetrates dust clouds more easily than that at optical wavelengths, so astronomers using the infrared can study stars forming deep inside dense dust clouds, the centre of the Galaxy, and other galaxies (both normal and peculiar). Astronom- ical sources of infrared radiation also include the planets and other Solar System bodies, stars and the dusty regions themselves. Wien’s law shows that relatively low-tempera- ture objects (less than 3000 K) emit most strongly, and so are easiest to observe, in the infrared. Astronomers on the ground, using the infrared, must confine their observations to the atmospheric ‘windows’ where there is very little absorption by water vapour or car- bon dioxide, and infrared telescopes are usually sited on mountain tops (above about 3000 m/l0,000 ft) to take advantage of the windows at 0.75–2.5 \u0001 m, 3–5 \u0001 m, 7.5–14 \u0001 m and 16–21 \u0001 m. Mauna Kea in Hawaii and Ata- cama in Chile are examples of good sites. To avoid the Earth’s atmosphere, infrared observations have been made from high-flying aircraft, notably the KUIPER AIRBORNE OBSERVATORY (KAO) and the new STRATOSPHERIC OBSER - VA TO RY FOR INFRARED ASTRONOMY (SOFIA), from unmanned balloons, rockets, and from Earth-orbiting satel- lites. The INFRARED ASTRONOMICAL SATELLITE (IRAS) sur- ve y ed the entire sky at several infrared wavelengths cataloguing almost a quarter of a million objects. More recently the INFRARED SPACE OBSERVATORY (ISO) targeted ov er 30,000 astronomical objects for detailed study. There w ere several other early surveys, two of which were particu- larly noteworthy: one from the ground, the 2 \u0001 m Sky Sur- v ey by Gerry Neugebauer (1932– ) and Robert Leighton (1919–97), producing the IRC catalogue published in 1969; and one using rockets, the Air Force Geophysics Laboratory survey by Steve Price and Russ Walker, pro- ducing the AFGL catalogue published in 1976. Astronomical sources can emit infrared radiation either throughout the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM (according to the PLANCK DISTRIBUTION of BLACK BODY RADIATION ) or in one or more spectral lines or bands, depending upon the temperature and composition of the emitting gas ( see EMISSION SPECTRUM ). The emission in the infrared lines is sometimes the main mechanism for cooling gas/dust clouds (such as the dense clouds where new stars are forming). Among the most important infrared atomic lines are the FORBIDDEN LINES of carbon ([C II] at 157 \u0001 m) and oxygen ([O III] at 88.35 \u0001 m). There are ve ry important molecular bands found in emission and ABSORPTION , in particular hydrogen (H 2 ), water (H 2 O), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Infrared observations from space, with ISO, have shown that water is very common in the Solar System, in the Galaxy and in other galaxies. The infrared has revealed the existence of another type of molecule, polycyclic aro- matic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the emission bands of which w ere originally known as the Unidentified Infrared Bands (UIBs). The molecular bands are not only indicative of chemical composition but also of the physical processes in progress, such as the passage of shock waves through regions in which star formation is occurring. The infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum has many broad features due to the solid material (dust) in interstellar space or around stars. The dust grains range greatly in size, but a typical value is a few tens of micrometres. Very small dust grains (with sizes of a few micrometres) can be transiently heated to about 1000 K and emit MID - INFRARED radiation. Silicate dust has often been found in crystalline form as well as the amorphous (astronomical) silicate form, giving sharp spikes in the normally very smooth broad emission features. Water-ice and carbon dioxide ice have also been detected in the infrared, in star-forming regions. Carbon-rich dust, such as silicon carbide, can also be observed via its infrared emission features. Both old and young astronomical objects show these dust features. Probably the most studied and most famous molecu- lar cloud is in Orion’s sword, where star formation is observed in progress in the densest parts of the ORION MOLECULAR CLOUDS . Temperatures in this cloud reach about 2000 K in regions where shock waves excite mole- cular hydrogen, but other regions range from a few tens to a few hundred degrees. The infrared region of the spectrum is very sensitive to the slightest heating of the dust cloud as it starts to collapse. IRAS showed that there is a great deal of star formation occurring in Orion, not just in the sword region. The huge infrared emission output when stars are forming means that these regions can be detected at large distances; the STARBURST GALAXIES are one example. Another type that is very bright in the infrared, and hence can be detected at large distances, is a galaxy with an A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS (AGN), which is thought to be powered by a BLACK HOLE . The infrared can be used to detect the difference between these two types of galaxy, since the starburst galaxy lacks some of the most energetic forbidden lines found in the AGN spectrum. Closer to home, Solar System scientists have used the techniques of infrared astronomy to work out the basic chemistry of the planets, their satellites and the asteroids. In the NEAR - INFRARED , molecules in planetary atmospheres exhibit a rich absorption spectrum, the analysis of which permits the composition and temperature of the atmos- pheres to be established. By careful selection of a precise infrared wavelength, different layers in the atmosphere can be probed in detail because of the variations in temperature. Observations of the outer planets from ISO have shown the presence of water in their upper atmospheres due to icy material falling on to them from interplanetary space. infrared cirrus T enuous cold dust in interstellar space which emits faintly in the infrared.

Recent developments in detectors mean that the submillimetre region is now considered to start at 350 \u0001 m.

The first interferometer was developed by Albert Michelson (1852–1931) in the 1920s, and it w orked at optical wavelengths. It consisted of mirrors at either end of a steel beam placed across the aperture of the 100-inch (2.5-m) telescope at Mount Wilson, and with it Michelson measured diameters of a few large stars by examining the interference pattern formed in the eyepiece. Modern systems link two telescopes, either electronically or by laser beams, and use electronic devices, such as PHOTOMETERS , to record the signals. The technique has been used with great success at radio wa v elengths ( see also RADIO INTERFEROMETER ). The two telescopes receive the signal at different times because the wa v es of the electromagnetic radiation have to travel farther to one of the telescopes than to the other. This delay is slightly different for separate, but adjacent, points on the sky, so that for an extended object, such as a large galaxy or nebula, the interference pattern is washed out. interacting galaxies P airs or groups of GALAXIES whose forms are distorted by the gravitational influence between them, sometimes leading to a merger. These interactions can set long tidal tails of stars and gas into motion well away from the original galaxy (some pieces of which can eventually clump together to form DW ARF GALAXIES ). Galaxy interactions are though to cause STARBURST activity, including what appear to be newly formed GLOBULAR CLUSTERS , and perhaps some kinds of A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI . Interamnia Sixth-largest MAIN - BELT ASTEROID ;num ber 704. It has a diameter of 316 km (196 mi). Interamnia w as not discovered until 1910 due to its low albedo (0.07). interference Effect observed when two trains of waves of the same wavelength meet. If maxima (crests) of the wa v es arrive simultaneously at the same place, their maxima add together to produce a wave of larger amplitude. This is constructive interference. If the maxima of one train coincide with the minima (troughs) of the other, this is destructive interference. They cancel totally if the amplitudes of the two wave trains are identical, otherwise they cancel partially. Thus two wave trains crossing each other produce an interference pattern , with alternate lines of constructive interaction and of destructive interaction. This applies to any wave motion – electromagnetic radiation or waves on the surface of liquids. interferometry Study of point-like (unresolved) astronomical objects using INTERFERENCE to reveal more detail in the object via the interference pattern produced. There are two types of interferometry, using SPECKLE INTERFEROMETRY or an INTENSITY INTERFEROMETER , to determine spatial detail, and there are other types to study spectral lines in detail ( see F ABRY – PERÓT INTERFEROMETER ). An interferometer works on the principle that ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION (usually optical or radio) will follow two paths to produce the interference, either because of Earth’s atmosphere in the case of speckle interferometry, or through two paths in the same instrument (as in the case of Fabry–Perót), or via two telescopes (intensity interferometer). If the two signals are combined correctly they will either reinforce or cancel, depending on the delay: when the signals are in phase (that is, they either have no delay or a delay corresponding to a whole number of wavelengths) then the maximum combined signal will be obtained. See also STELLAR INTERFEROMETER ; VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY intergalactic matter Matter in the space between GALAXIES . There is no significant amount of dust in intergalactic space, but there is ample evidence for several kinds of gas. Within galaxy clusters, the hot intracluster medium is at temperatures of typically 20 million K and has been chemically enriched by supernovae. Outside these clusters, observations of absorption lines, above all from material in front of distant and luminous QU ASARS , shows an intricate medium tracing the large-scale distribution of ordinary matter (which must be close to that of the D ARK MATTER as well, since its gravity will be the dominant force). Hydrogen and helium absorption shows that this intergalactic matter is highly ionized everywhere, and more so in the least dense regions, where particle collisions that could lead to RECOMBINATION are less frequent. Because it is so highly ionized, and only the tiny neutral fraction is observed, the amount and chemistry of this matter are still ve ry uncertain. Even intergalactic matter in the lowest- density regions, generally most remote from luminous galaxies, has been enriched to some degree with atoms synthesized in stars, as shown by the presence of highly ionized oxygen traced in observations from FUSE and the Hubble Space Telescope. Thus the intergalactic medium is not simply leftover material that never formed galaxies: it has, at least in the early Universe, participated in the stellar recycling inside galaxies. International Amateur–Professional Photoelectric Photometry (IAPPP) Organization that fosters partner- ships among amateur, professional and student astronomers who wish to make precise brightness obser- va tions of celestial objects. Formed in 1980, the IAPPP w as far ahead of its time in promoting such collaborations, which are becoming more important as the pace of astro- nomical discovery quickens and the need for continuing follow-up observations grows.

Founded in 1919, the IAU has 11 scientific divisions and 40 commissions covering all aspects of astronomy. Its membership includes most of the professional community active in astronomical research and education at PhD level and beyond, and amounts to some 8300 individuals in 67 countries. The IAU is perhaps best known as the sole authority responsible for naming celestial bodies and their surface features. However, its remit extends far beyond that, and ranges from the definition of fundamental astronomical constants to strategic planning of future large-scale facili- ties. It holds a General Assembly every three years at which its long-term policy is defined, and sponsors about a dozen high-profile symposia and colloquia each year. The IAU also promotes education research in developing countries through its International Schools for Young Astronomers. The organization’s headquarters are at the Institute d’Astrophysique in Paris, where a permanent secretariat is based. International Atomic Time (TAI) Continuous and uniform time scale derived from atomic clocks and used for scientific purposes. TAI is based on the SI second ( see AT OMIC TIME ) and is formed retrospectively by intercomparing data from around 200 atomic clocks, or frequency standards as they are known, at around 40 laboratories across the globe. Each of these atomic clocks should be accurate to within one second in three million y ears, but a large number are used to form the time scale in order to reduce the likelihood of the results from any rogue timepieces affecting the overall combined mean. The resultant TAI time scale is then used as a standard against which other clocks can be measured. T AI has run continuously, without adjustment, since 0 h 0 m 0 s GMT on 1958 January 1 and is co-ordinated by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris. Because it is both uniform and contin- uous, it is ideal as a time scale for scientific purposes but not practical for everyday use, since it is not linked to the rotation of the Earth. For the purposes of forming an accurate civil time scale COORDINATED UNIVERSAL TIME (UTC) was introduced. This is still derived from atomic clocks but is kept in step with the Earth’s rotation through the periodic introduction of LEAP SECONDS . Because of this, UTC differs from TAI by an integral number of seconds. Every major industrial nation contributes to Interna- tional Atomic Time. In the UK, responsibility for main- taining the national time service is held by the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington. Prior to 1984 the Time Service was the responsibility of the Royal Greenwich Observatory. See also TIMEKEEPING International Cometary Explorer (ICE) NASA spacecraft originally launched in 1978 as ISEE-3 (International Sun–Earth Explorer-3); it was renamed when it was diverted by means of a lunar gravitational assist to fly through the tail of Comet GIACOBINI – ZINNER . The comet flyby – the first ever made – took place on 1985 September 11. ICE later passed the sunward side of Halley’s Comet in 1986 March at a distance of 28 million km (17 million mi). International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) Interna- tional non-profit organization, based in the USA, founded in 1988 to campaign against the adverse impact of LIGHT POLLUTION on optical astronomy. The IDA seeks to raise public awareness about good and bad outdoor-lighting practices, including aesthetic, security and economic issues. The IDA is also building awareness of other threats to the astronomical environment, such as from radio-fre- quency interference and space debris and from other pol- lutants such as aircraft contrails. International Date Line Imaginary, irregular line, close to and sometimes coincident with that of 180º longitude, marking the point on the Earth where the date changes; points east of the line being one day earlier than those west of it. Located mainly in the Pacific Ocean, therefore avoid- ing places of habitation, the line avoids crossing land by skirting around Siberia, the Aleutian Islands, the Fiji Islands and New Zealand. It was adopted by international agreement in 1885. International Geophysical Year (IGY) Period of intensive, multi-nation collaborative research, including studies of solar and auroral process, meteorology and oceanography, that was was carried out between 1957 July 1 and 1958 December 31. International Meteor Organization (IMO) Organiza- tion dedicated to the study of meteors and their parent dust particles, established in 1988, with a worldwide membership. The IMO collects data taken visually, pho- tographically, by video and by radio. It maintains a data- base of visual observations extending back to 1984 and publishes WGN , a bimonthly journal. International Occultation Timing Association (IOTA) International organization founded in 1975 to encourage and facilitate the observation of occultations and eclipses. It provides predictions for grazing occulta- tions of stars by the Moon and of stars by asteroids and planets, and acts as a coordinating body for reports of such events. IOTA is based at Topeka, Kansas, and has a European Section. International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) Missions Major multi-agency, multi-spacecraft programme of the 1990s aimed at exploring the terrestrial MAGNETOSPHERE and near-Earth space. The overall goal of the programme is to improve our understanding of the solar–terrestrial interaction, particularly the coupling of matter and energy between the SOLAR WIND and the magnetosphere. Central elements include WIND , a NASA satellite instrumented to study the solar wind upstream of the Earth and thus provide information on the likely external conditions affecting the magnetosphere. A sister NASA spacecraft, POLAR , in an eccentric polar orbit with apogee over the northern pole, observes activity of the AUR ORA and makes plasma measurements within the cusps of the magnetosphere. The Japanese space agency ISAS provided the spacecraft GEOTAIL , which is designed to make measurements of the nightside magnetotail region of the Earth.

The European element, CLUSTER , was finally launched in the summer of 2000, after the original four-spacecraft mission was lost to launch failure in 1996. This mission is designed to study boundaries, such as the BOW SHOCK and MAGNETOPAUSE . A number of other missions and facilities are associated with ISTP and provide supporting and context information. These missions include SOHO (the SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY ), the Russian Interball missions, Equator-S, and many ground-based radars, all- sky cameras and magnetometer networks located around the northern auroral zones. International Space Station (ISS) SPACE STATION , which when completed in 2006 – budgets, schedule and technology permitting – will be a space superlative, measuring 111.32 m (365 ft) from end to end. The space station was originally given the go-ahead in 1984, in response to the Soviet Union permanent presence in orbit. This US programme, first called Freedom, which w as to have been operational in 1994, became embroiled in politics and financial problems. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia had no money to build a new space station. The US government was on the point of cancelling Freedom, but the station was saved when Russia joined the programme. The reconfigured ISS was to have been declared operational in 2001 but that deadline has already slipped to 2006. Still known as the International Space Station, although having an unofficial name, Alpha, the project is subject to further delays due to financial and technical difficulties. It is planned that the ISS will eventually be crewed by up to seven people, but that is unlikely before 2008. It will have 1624 m 3 (46,000 cubic feet) of pressurized space in several modules – the equivalent of a Boeing 747 Jumbo jet – and will be equipped with four photovoltaic modules, each with two arrays 34.16 m (112 ft) long and 11.89 m (39 ft) wide, generating 23 kW, and with a surface area of about half an acre. The electrical power system will be connected by 12.8 km (8 mi) of wire. A major external part of the ISS will be the Canadian remote manipulator system comprising two robot arms and a mobile trans- porter travelling along the length of the station. The ISS will concentrate on five main areas of science research – life sciences, space science, Earth science, engi- neering research and technology, and space product development. It will consist of six major scientific modules serviced by connecting passageways (called nodes), ser- vice and control modules, living quarters, an airlock, the manipulator system, logistics vehicles and crew transfer v ehicles and propulsion modules. A major benefit of the ISS will be the cooperative work of so many nations of the w orld. The ISS is going to be the largest international civil, cooperative programme ever attempted, involving 16 nations – the USA, Russia, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Bel- g ium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The likelihood is that the ISS will not quite resemble what has been designed and will develop more on a step-by-step basis, according to the state of delays and finances, with redesigns and compromises being continually made. It may not be declared operational until 2010. International Sun–Earth Explorer (ISEE) Series of three NASA–ESA scientific satellites launched in 1977–78 in an international project to study the near- Earth environment (particularly the magnetosphere) and its interaction with the SOLAR WIND . International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) Joint project of the NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA), the EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA) and the UK. It was the longest-lived astronomical spacecraft ever flown, and arguably the most important ultraviolet space observatory so far launched. IUE was launched by a DELTA rocket in 1978 January. It carried a 45-cm (18-in.) telescope and spectrographs equipped with ultraviolet-sensitive cameras to study Solar System objects, stars and galaxies. The observing time on IUE was initially shared out between the three agencies in approximate proportion to their contributions, with NASA getting two-thirds of the time and the UK and ESA one-sixth each. After 1981 the combined European share was assigned on scientific merit alone. IUE was inserted into a geosynchronous elliptical orbit between 26,000 and 45,000 km (16,000–28,000 mi) high and inclined at 28º.4 to the equator. As a result, it was vis- ible from the ESA ground station in Spain for up to 12 hours a day and permanently visible from the NASA g round station in Maryland. Control of IUE was trans- ferred permanently to Europe in 1995 October. During its lifetime, IUE made 104,000 ultraviolet observations. The data are kept in three archives, one operated by each of the collaborating agencies, easing access for thousands of astronomers around the world. In the Solar System, IUE observed dozens of comets, including Comet HALLEY , Comet HYAKUTAKE and Comet ENCKE , which was studied during several returns. It was also used to monitor asteroids, the atmospheres of the g iant planets and the cloud of ions associated with Jupiter’s moon Io. Beyond the Solar System, IUE provided new insights into stellar winds and energy transport in the atmospheres of hot, massive stars. Its flexibility opened the door to studies of unpredictable novae and Supernova 1987A. Ultraviolet emissions from ‘normal’ galaxies, Seyfert galaxies and quasars helped to unravel the processes tak- ing place in accretion disks around massive black holes.

The cloud consists of dust particles a few micrometres in size, and it extends for at least 600 million km (370 million mi). It is extremely tenuous: at the Earth’s orbit its average density is equivalent to a single particle, two micrometres across, in a region of space one hundred cubic metres in volume. Sunlight scattered by the cloud is responsible for the ZODIACAL LIGHT . In the scattering process the dust parti- cles absorb energy from the Sun on their illuminated side b ut re-radiate it isotropically.

As they approach the Sun, the particles are eroded, chiefly by evaporation and the effect of the SOLAR WIND . The rate of depletion of the dust particles indicates that the cloud must be continually replenished by some mech- anism, otherwise it would have completely dispersed by now. Collisions between ASTEROIDS had long been sus- pected as a possible source of replenishment, and in 1983 the INFRARED ASTRONOMICAL SATELLITE (IRAS) located three bands of dust in the region of the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. These bands are believed to be the result of collisions between asteroids. Over a long period of time, the particles within the bands slowly decelerate, moving inwards from the asteroid belt towards the Sun and spreading out into the background cloud of interplanetary dust. Asteroid collision alone cannot produce sufficient material to replenish the cloud at the required rate, howev- er, and analysis of data from both the IRAS and the COS - MIC BACKGROUND EXPLORER (COBE) satellites indicates that main-belt asteroids are the source of approximately only 33% of the interplanetary dust. Comets are another source of interplanetary dust, pro- ducing dust each time they enter the inner Solar System. The largest particles produce METEOR STREAMS , whilst the smallest are incorporated into the dust cloud. Even this does not account for all the new material required, though, and the remainder is thought to be cosmic in ori- g in. The issue as to the ultimate source of the dust is still open to debate, but satellite observations of the sky bright- ness and in-situ measurements of the dust particles are advancing our understanding of the relative contributions from comets, asteroids and the interstellar medium. interplanetary dust particle See MICROMETEORITE interplanetary magnetic field See SOLAR WIND interplanetary medium T enuous mixture of INTERPLANETARY DUST , charged atomic particles and neutral gas that occupies the space between the planets. The dust is believed to have originated from collisions between asteroids and from comets entering the inner Solar System. The charged particles – electrons, protons and helium nuclei (alpha particles) – stream out from the Sun as the SOLAR WIND , while the neutral gas exists in the form of hydrogen and helium atoms. As the Sun moves through space it passes through interstellar matter, resulting in a continual stream of neutral atoms through the Solar System. Interstellar matter is quickly ionized by the solar wind. See also ZODIACAL LIGHT interstellar absorption ABSORPTION or EXTINCTION of light by interstellar dust ( see INTERSTELLAR MATTER ). On av erage, the extinction amounts to one stellar magnitude per kiloparsec of distance. interstellar dust See INTERSTELLAR MATTER interstellar grain V olumetrically insignificant, but scientifically critical, component within CHONDRITE meteorites. Interstellar and circumstellar grains comprise several populations of nanometre-sized diamond particles and micrometre-sized silicon carbide, graphite and aluminium oxide particles. The presence of the grains w as first inferred in the late 1970s to early 1980s on the basis of the isotopic composition of noble gases found in mineralogical analyses of chondrites. The unusual isotopic signatures of the noble gases implied the existence of several different hosts; analyses of acid- resistant residues suggested that the hosts might be carbon-rich. Together with the noble gas results, carbon and nitrogen isotope data imply a variety of extra-solar sources for the grains, including supernovae and red giant stars. Currently, grains from at least 15 different extra- solar sources have been isolated from chondritic meteorites. These grains were presumably introduced into the pre-solar nebula prior to its collapse and the onset of protoplanet formation. interstellar matter Molecules that exist in interstellar MOLECULAR CLOUDS . The main constituents of interstellar matter are everywhere the same, mostly h ydrogen with some helium, but the proportions of the minor constituents differ widely between different locations. The total density and other properties of this matter also differ widely from place to place. Mostly, the matter is gaseous but a small proportion is embodied in the form of minute solid dust particles. On average there are about 10 6 a toms m \u0001 3 and one dust grain per 100,000 m 3 of space (for comparison, there are about 3 \u0002 10 25 molecules m \u0001 3 in Earth’s atmosphere at sea level). Although the density of interstellar matter is extremely low, the volume of the space in a galaxy is so g reat that the total quantity of interstellar material is very considerable. Our own Galaxy contains about 10 10 solar masses of material between the stars, making up about 10% of its total mass. Most of this matter is distributed in the spiral arms and the disk of our Galaxy and is confined to a layer only a few hundred light-years thick. The most obvious manifestations of interstellar materi- al are nebulae. Several types have been classified – REFLECTION NEBULAE , HII REGIONS , PLANETARY NEBULAE , SUPERNOVA REMNANTS , GLOBULES and D ARK NEBULAE . The differences between these stem mainly from the way the material is illuminated or the way light from other sources is obscured; they also vary in density or recent his- tory. Other types of nebulae not apparent on optical pho- tographs are molecular clouds, which can be detected by their emission or absorption of radio, microwave or infrared radiation rather than of visible radiation. The existence of gas between the stars was discovered in 1904 by Johann HARTMANN through the observation that a few of the absorption lines recorded in the spectrum of the binary star \u0003 Orionis did not change in wavelength (by the Doppler effect) as the star moved around its orbit. This followed the observation in 1874 by William HUG - GINS that certain nebulae had a spectrum characteristic of rarefied gas. Since that time interstellar absorption lines have been recorded in the spectra of many stars. In the optical region these lines are few in number and are usual- ly much narrower than the stellar features themselves. Fre- quently they have multiple Doppler-shifted components, arising from clouds with different line-of-sight velocities. The strongest optical lines are due to neutral sodium and singly ionized calcium atoms. A large number of atoms in va r ious states of ionization have their absorption lines at ultraviolet wavelengths and have been studied by means of telescopes borne on balloons, rockets or spacecraft. The Lyman- \u0004 transition ( see L YMAN SERIES ) of neutral hydro- gen, falling at 121.6 nm wavelength, is by far the strongest of all absorption lines observed. While most of the hydro- gen is neutral, some elements exist in the interstellar medi- um primarily in an ionized state. The ionization of such elements arises largely from the presence of energetic pho- tons from stars. The low density of the general interstellar medium ensures that the time an atom in the ionized state has to wait before it can recombine with a free electron is quite long. Hydrogen molecules are detected at far-ultravi- olet wavelengths from absorption lines in the spectra of hot stars. Some 120 other INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES have now been identified, many quite complex and mostly to be found in the depths of GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUDS . The total number of atoms or molecules of each kind between a background star and us can be calculated from the shape and strength of the characteristic absorption features in the star’s spectrum. Significant differences in the abundances of the heavier elements relative to hydro- gen are found between the interstellar medium and the stars. For example, in some cases the interstellar gas seems to contain only a hundredth of the iron and a thousandth of the calcium that is commonly present in the atmos- interplanetary dust particle 202 I I AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 6:30 pm Page 202"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"pheres of stars. The missing proportions are in the inter- stellar dust grains (small grains of matter, typically about 100 nm in diameter, in interstellar space). These dust g rains are very effective at absorbing and scattering visible and ultraviolet light, thus making distant stars appear fainter and redder. Because the grains produce polariza- tion of starlight, they are believed to be elongated particles aligned by the galactic magnetic field. Most grains appear to be composed of silicates or graphite; some have icy mantles. The grains may form by condensing from gas flowing out of the atmospheres of cool stars. Most of our knowledge about the large-scale distribu- tion of the interstellar gas in our Galaxy has come from the study of the emission and absorption of radiation detected at the TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE LINE of neu- tral atomic hydrogen. From the Doppler shifts of the lines, clouds with different velocities along the same line of sight can be distinguished, allowing the distribution and motion of the neutral gas in distant parts of the Galaxy to be studied. Such observations show that neu- tral hydrogen clouds ( HI REGIONS ) are clustered mostly along the spiral arms. Even when taken together, molecular clouds and neu- tral hydrogen clouds very far from fill the volume of inter- stellar space. Although it is still a subject of speculation, much of the gas between the clouds is thought to be very hot and very tenuous, at a temperature of around a million K and a density of a few thousand particles per cubic metre. It is thought to be the outcome of the expansion of numerous supernova remnants. interstellar molecules Molecules that occupy the space between the stars. In this harsh environment few molecules are able to survive. The ultraviolet radiation from stars will quickly cause many of them to dissociate. Some molecules, however, such as titanium oxide (TiO), cy anogen (CN) and diatomic carbon (C 2 ), are sufficiently stable to survive in the immediate vicinity of stars, or even in the outer layers of cool stars. These molecules can be observed through the absorption bands that they produce in the optical and infrared spectra of the stars. Most interstellar molecules, however, require shelter from ultraviolet radiation in order to survive. The mole- cules themselves provide this shelter, since they can exist in either gaseous or solid form (no liquids are known or to be expected in interstellar space). The solid takes the form of interstellar dust particles ( see INTERSTELLAR MATTER ), which appear to be composed of silicates or graphite and sometimes possess outer layers of frozen gases. The com- position of the particles is difficult to establish with cer- tainty, but they are known to be a few hundred nanometres in size and possibly needle-shaped; they absorb starlight very efficiently ( see D ARK NEBULAE ). Con- centrations of particles can shelter gaseous interstellar molecules from the stellar ultraviolet radiation. Thus the main sites where molecules can be found are inside cold dense gas and dust clouds ( see MOLECULAR CLOUDS ). Prior to the advent of radio astronomy, a few molecules we re discovered from the ABSORPTION LINES that they pro- duced in the optical spectra of stars. These molecules were CH, CH+ and CN, and they could only be detected with- in clouds that were thin enough for stars beyond the cloud to be observed. Such clouds would not be dense enough to provide shelter for more complex interstellar molecules. Most interstellar molecules have been detected from their emissions or absorptions at radio wavelengths. The reason for this is that molecules can emit or absorb radia- tion by three separate processes. In the optical region, most spectrum lines from molecules are due to changes in the energy state of electrons within the molecule. Ener- gy can also be stored by molecules in the form of the vibrations of its constituent atoms and by the rotation of the molecule itself. Just as the energies of electrons are quantized, so also can these vibrational and rotational energies only take specific values. Thus when the mole- cule changes its vibrational or rotational energy it does so in discrete steps and produces emission or absorption lines. The energy stored in the form of molecular vibra- tions or rotations is much less than that stored by elec- trons, and so the resulting spectrum lines are at long wa v elengths. Vibrational lines mostly appear in the infrared, and rotational lines in the microwave and radio regions. Inside molecular clouds the temperature is low, and so the molecules typically emit or absorb only via the lowest energy rotational transitions. The most abundant molecule in molecular clouds is expected to be that of hydrogen (H 2 ). However, the h ydrogen molecule is symmetrical, like a miniature bar- bell, which means that the rotational transitions are FOR - BIDDEN and so molecular hydrogen does not produce spectrum lines within the molecular clouds. It can, howev- er, sometimes be observed weakly when temperatures reach 500 K or more, for example in shock fronts between colliding gas clouds. In 1963 the first interstellar molecule detected by radio astronomy was hydroxyl (OH). Detec- tion of the second most abundant molecule, carbon monoxide (CO), soon followed, from its lines at 115, 230 and 340 GHz (wavelengths of 2.6, 1.3 and 0.9 mm). The carbon monoxide lines are now widely used as an easily observed tracer for molecular clouds. Detection of polyatomic molecules such as water (H 2 O) and ammonia (NH 3 ) came in 1968. It was soon followed by the discovery of some of the hydrocarbons (compounds of hydrogen and carbon such as methane, CH 4 ). More recently, much more complex atoms includ- ing, possibly, the amino acid glycine (NH 2 CH 2 COOH), which forms one of the building blocks for our form of life, have been found. Currently a thirteen-atom molecule, HC 11 N, is the most complex found. About 120 interstellar molecules are now known and more are being added at the rate of a few every year. interstellar planet PLANET that wanders in interstellar space, not gravitationally bound to any star. In recent y ears candidate objects have been discovered in deep space, for example in the Orion Nebula. There is debate as to whether these objects should properly be classed as planets or whether they should be categorized as stars, even though many of them have insufficient mass ever to initiate hydrogen or even deuterium fusion in their cores, making them sub-brown dwarfs. The terms ‘planetar’ or ‘grey dwarf ’ have been coined to label them. Considering bodies of a quite different size and nature much closer to home, there are several TRANS - NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS with aphelion distances so large (some hundreds of astronomical units) that they may be on the verge of escaping into interstellar space.

The source of the scintillation is irregularities in the electron and ion density of the INTERSTELLAR MATTER . Movements within the medium, or more usually of the Earth and the radio source, cause the radio source to fluctuate in brightness on a time scale of a few minutes to a few hours as the scattering and delay within the interstellar medium alters. intraterrestrial asteroid ASTEROID that has an orbit entirely interior to that of the Earth; it thus has an aphelion distance of less than 0.9833 AU. By analogy, intravenusian and intramercurian asteroids might also be defined. No such bodies are known, although they have been suggested in the past ( see VULCAN ). The discovery of such bodies would be difficult using ground-based telescopes because they are always on the sunward side of our planet. intrinsic variable V ARIABLE STAR in which the variations in brightness arise from processes that cause an actual change in the amount of radiation emitted, rather than modulate a fixed output. Typical processes are pulsation (both radial and non-radial) and eruptions (both from the accretion of material, as in a CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE , and from internal mechanisms as in a FLARE STAR ). See also EXTRINSIC VARIABLE invariable plane Plane of reference that is at right angles to the total ANGULAR MOMENTUM v ector of the Solar System; it is unaffected in orientation by any of the PERTURBATIONS between the bodies in the Solar System. It is inclined at 1º.577 to the ECLIPTIC of EPOCH J2000. As most of the angular momentum of the Solar System is contained in the orbit of Jupiter, the invariable plane has an INCLINATION of just 0º.324 to Jupiter’s orbital plane. The angular momentum of a body depends on its position, velocity and mass. The positions and velocities of the planets at any instant relative to the ecliptic are well known, but the masses of some planets are not so well known, and thus the calculation of the location of the invariable plane is a little uncertain and it is not used much as a reference plane. It is, however, used in the definition of the north and south poles of planets and satellites, which are defined as north if they are above the invariable plane. inverse-square law Frequently encountered relationship whereby the magnitude of a physical quantity diminishes in proportion to the square of distance. Common examples of the inverse square law include Newton’s law of gravity: Coulomb’s law, giving the force between two charged particles: where Q 1 and Q 2 are the charges on the particles, d is their separation and \u0001 , the permitivity of the intervening medium. Also the brightness, I d , of a point light source a distance, d , away from the observer is given by an inverse-square law: This last expression results in Pogson’s equation relating the magnitudes, m 1 and m 2 , of two objects to their brightnesses: invisible astronomy Astronomical research at wave- lengths of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION invisible to the human eye. This covers GAMMA - RAY ASTRONOMY , X - RAY ASTRONOMY , ULTRAVIOLET ASTRONOMY , INFRARED ASTRONOMY , RADAR ASTRONOMY , RADIO ASTRONOMY , and the study of particles such as COSMIC RAYS and NEU - TRINOS . By studying celestial bodies across the whole of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM , and not just at visible wa v elengths, astronomers are able to build up a more complete picture of the Universe. Io Innermost of the GALILEAN SATELLITES of JUPITER . Its size, mass and density are all only a little greater than those of the Moon, yet strong TIDAL HEATING by Jupiter makes it by far the most volcanically active body in the Solar System. Unlike the other Galilean satellites, Io is ice-free, and it has a sulphur-stained rocky surface. Of the many revelations from the VOYA GER tours of the outer Solar System, the discovery of active volcanoes on Io probably ranks among the most important. Before Voyager, most people had assumed that bodies of Io’s size, whether rocky or icy, would be geologically dead like the Moon. It is now realised that the orbital RESONANCE between the three innermost Galilean satellites results in tidal heating. The effect is greatest for Io because it is closest to Jupiter and hence experiences the strongest tidal forces. There are often more than a dozen volcanoes erupting on Io at any one time. These are identified either by a visi- ble ‘eruption plume’ powered by the explosive escape of sulphur dioxide, and rising 100–400 km (60–250 mi) above the surface, or by infrared detection of a hot spot. The record for the highest local temperature is at least 1700 K, whereas the normal daytime surface temperature on Io is only 120 K. Io’s density indicates that it is predominantly a silicate body, like the TERRESTRIAL PLANETS . Gravity and mag- netic observations by the GALILEO orbiter confirm that it has a dense, presumably iron-rich core below its rocky mantle. Spectroscopic data show that Io’s surface is cov- ered by sulphur, sulphur dioxide frost and other sulphur compounds. However, these are no more than thin, v olatile veneers resulting from volcanic activity, and the crust as a whole is some kind of silicate rock. Io’s tenuous atmosphere contains sulphur dioxide, as w ell as atoms of oxygen, sodium and potassium.

Io’s atmos- phere continually leaks away into space, contributing to a ‘cloud’ of sodium and potassium atoms falling inwards towards Jupiter and into a magnetically confined belt of ionized sulphur that stretches right round Jupiter, concen- trated around Io’s orbit (the Io torus). The atmosphere is replenished by a combination of volcanic activity and col- lisions on to Io’s surface by high-speed ions channelled by Jupiter’s magnetic field. When Io passes into the shadow of Jupiter its atmosphere can be seen faintly glowing in an auroral display caused by these same magnetospheric ions impinging on the atmosphere. Io’s surface is totally dominated by the results of vol- canic activity. There are lava flows up to several hundred kilometres in length and vast swathes of mostly flat ter- rain covered by fallout from eruption plumes. Most of the lava flows are now believed to have formed from molten silicate rock, which is often discoloured by a sul- phurous surface coating, but there could also be some flows that formed from molten sulphur. The theory that prevailed for several years after the initial Voyager obser- va tions – that all or most of Io’s lava flows are formed from sulphur – has been disproved by temperature mea- surements of eruption sites by the Galileo spacecraft and by infrared telescopes operating from Earth. Indeed, some of the temperatures detected are not only too high to represent molten sulphur, which would boil away at less than 700 K, but also too high to be characteristic of most types of molten rock, including basalt, which is the most common lava on the Earth and Moon. The excep- tionally hot sites on Io might possibly be where a silica- poor, magnesium-rich relative of basalt known as komatiite is able to reach the surface. In some places volcanoes rise above the general level of Io’s plains. Their summits are occupied by volcanic calderas, up to 200 km (120 mi) across, which are formed by subsidence of the roof of the volcano after magma has been erupted from within. No impact craters are visible, even on the most detailed images, because the v olcanic eruptions deposit fresh materials across the globe at an average rate of approximately a centimetre thickness per year. More than 500 volcanoes have been identified on Io, and about 100 of these have been seen to erupt. The long duration of the Galileo mission enabled many changes on Io’s surface to be documented, including deposits left by fallout from eruption plumes and new lava flows. Io’s vol- canoes appear to be randomly distributed, and Io certain- ly lacks the kind of well-defined global pattern displayed by the Earth. Unlike Earth, which releases internal heat by plate TECTONICS , and Venus, where heat escapes by con- duction, probably punctuated by bouts of resurfacing every half billion years or so, Io’s heat escapes through a multitude of volcanoes. One factor that probably influ- ences the difference between the Earth and Io is that, to maintain a steady temperature, Io has to lose heat at a rate of about 2.5 W/m 2 compared with only 0.08 W/m 2 for the Earth. Possibly, the tidal heating experienced by Io is suf- ficient to keep a large fraction of its MANTLE partially molten. See date at JUPITER ion An ATO M that has lost (or gained) one or more electrons compared with the normal, or ‘neutral’, atom. A positive ion has fewer electrons and a negative ion has more electrons than a neutral atom. See also IONIZATION ionization Name given to any process by which normally electrically neutral atoms or molecules are converted into IONS , through the removal or addition of one or more electrons. This gives them a positive or negative electrical charge. An ion can itself be ionized, by losing or gaining a second electron. The minimum energy required to remove an electron from an atom, ion or molecule is called its ionization potential. For negative ions, the degree of ionization is denoted by a Roman numeral that is one larger than the number of lost electrons. For example, neutral iron is Fe I, singly ionized iron (one electron missing) is Fe II, doubly ionized iron is Fe III, and so on. An alternative notation is to indicate the net charge of the ion by superscript ‘ \u0001 ’ and ‘ \u0002 ’ signs. Using this system gives Fe \u0001 for singly ionized iron, Fe \u0001\u0001 for doubly ionized iron, and so on. This latter system has the advantage of incorporating the negative ions, as in H \u0002 , but it becomes cumbersome for high levels of ionization. Ionization normally occurs through the absorption of radiation or through collisions with other a toms and ions. The material that forms stars, planetary nebulae and HII REGIONS is almost completely ionized. In other regions some atoms may be ionized while others remain as neutral a toms; for example, in the Earth’s IONOSPHERE only about one atom in one million is actually ionized. ionosphere Region in the Earth’s A TMOSPHERE that extends from a height of about 60 to 500 km (40–310 mi) above the surface. Within this layer most of the atoms and molecules exist as electrically charged ions. This high degree of ionization is maintained by the continual absorption of ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the Sun. These free electrons and ions can disturb the transmission of radio waves through the ionosphere. There are several distinct ionized layers, which are known as the D, E, F 1 , F 2 and G layers. The layers are rather va r iable: at night the D layer disappears, the E layer w eakens or disappears, and the F 1 and F 2 layers merge. The D layer is situated at a height of between 60 and 90 km (40–60 mi), the E layer at 90–150 km (about 60–90 mi), the F 1 layer at 200 km (120 mi) and the F 2 layer at 300–400 km (190–250 mi). The free electrons in the E and F layers strongly reflect some radio waves: they enable long-distance radio communications by successively reflecting the waves between the layer and the ground. In RADIO ASTRONOMY , the presence of the E and F layers makes ground-based observations almost impossible below 10 MHz. The D layer, where collisions between the molecules and ions are more frequent, tends to absorb radio waves rather than reflect them.

The comet was discovered by Japanese amateur astronomer Genichi Araki (1954– ) and, independently, English amateur astronomer George Alcock (1912–2000) on May 3, having earlier been detected by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS). At closest approach, IRAS–Araki–Alcock reached mag. \u0001 2.0, showing a diffuse 2º diameter coma. Due to its proximity, the comet moved rapidly across the northern sky.

It is a metal. Iron’s properties include: atomic number 26; atomic mass of the natural element 55.847 amu; melting point 1808 K; boiling point 3023 K. It has 10 isotopes, with iron-54 (5.8%), iron-56 (91.7%), iron-57 (2.2%) and iron-58 (0.3%) being stable and occurring naturally on Earth. Iron is the major constituent of the cores of the planets Mercury, Venus and Earth, and of IRON METEORITES . Iron grains are believed to make up a proportion of the interstellar dust population. Elements up to and including iron can be built up by energy-releasing FUSION reactions, which act as energy sources in stars. Iron, however, has the highest BINDING ENERGY per nucleon, and so these NUCLEOSYNTHESIS reactions halt when it has been produced. See also METALS iron meteorite METEORITE composed of iron metal, generally with between 5 and 20% by weight nickel. Iron meteorites account for approximately 5% of all observed meteorite falls. The mineralogy of iron meteorites is dominantly an intergrowth of the two iron–nickel alloys kamacite and taenite. Kamacite ( \u0002 Fe,Ni) has a body- centred cubic structure and a nickel content less than 7% by weight. Taenite ( \u0003 Fe,Ni) is face-centred cubic and c .20–50% by weight nickel. Iron meteorites are highly differentiated materials, the products of extensive melting processes on their parent bodies. They can be divided into magmatic irons and non-magmatic irons. Magmatic irons are those that have solidified by fractional crystallization from a melt. Non- magmatic irons are those that seem not to have complete- ly melted; they may have formed during impact processes. The iron meteorites are subdivided into 13 different groups on the basis of nickel and trace element chemistries (gallium, germanium and iridum contents). Each separate group of magmatic irons has a fairly restricted range of nickel contents but a wide range of trace element abundances; these trends are consistent with fractional crystallization from a melt. In contrast, the non- magmatic irons show a wide range in nickel contents but less variation in trace element composition; these trends can be better explained by formation by partial melting. Many irons defy chemical classification and simply remain ‘ungrouped’. It is thought that each chemical group derives from its own parent asteroid. Prior to classification on the basis of trace-element chemistry, iron meteorites were classified in terms of their metallographic structure. Laths of kamacite intergrown with nickel-rich phases form the ‘Widmanstätten pattern’ revealed in polished and etched iron meteorites. The width of the kamacite lamellae allows classification of iron meteorites into five structural groups: the coarsest, coarse, medium, fine and finest octahedrites. Plessitic octa- hedrites are transitional between octahedrites and ataxites. Ataxites are nickel-rich, with more than 20% by weight nickel, and are mainly taenite. Hexahedrites have nickel less than 6% by weight and comprise kamacite only. Nei- ther hexahedrites nor ataxites display a classic Wid- manstätten pattern. Meteorites from an individual chemical group can display a range of structural types. irradiation Process by which a region of space or material is subjected to radiation, whether by light, radio, infrared or other forms of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION , or by energetic particles such as protons and electrons. irregular galaxy GALAXY that shows no symmetry. Some irregular galaxies are smaller than spiral and elliptical galaxies, contain much gas, and are undergoing star formation.

Islamic astronomy Astronomy as practised in the Middle East, North Africa and Moorish Spain during the flowering of the Islamic Empire, from around the 8th to the 14th century. Although it is sometimes referred to as Arab or Arabic astronomy , some of its practitioners were from other ethnic or linguistic groups, and the unifying cultural force in this region and during this period was Islam. Two circumstances fostered the growth of astronomy under Islamic rule. The first was that the seats of ancient learning lay within or just outside the bounds of the empire, and Islam was tolerant of scholars from other creeds. A second impetus came from Islamic religious observances, which gave rise to many problems in mathematical astronomy, mostly related to timekeeping. In solving these problems, Islamic astronomers went far beyond the Greek mathematical methods and provided essential tools for the creation of Western RENAISSANCE ASTRONOMY . Following the foundation of Baghdad, the new capital of the Abbasid dynasty, in AD 762, there began a massive effort to translate into Arabic all the major scientific texts of antiquity. The most vigorous patron was the Caliph al- 207 I \u0001 Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes High above the clouds on the Roque de Los Muchachos peak on La Palma, the ING telescopes enjoy some of the best observing conditions in Europe.

There, scholars of all creeds worked to translate manuscripts acquired from the ancient libraries that now lay within the empire, which stretched from Spain to India, to stock what was to become one of the world’s g reat academies. The chief scholar of this great enterprise was Abu’l- Hasan Tha ̄bit ibn Qurra ( c .835–901), who wrote over a hundred scientific treatises, including a commentary on Ptolemy’s ALMAGEST . Another astronomer (and geograph- er) in 9th-century Baghdad was Abu’l-Abbas al-Fargha ̄nı ̄ ( c .825–61), whose Elements helped to spread the more ele- mentary and non-mathematical parts of Ptolemy’s geocen- tric astronomy to the West. By 900 the stage was set for the spread of scientific knowledge throughout the Empire, with a single language, Arabic, as its vehicle. This knowl- edge later diffused into Christian Europe via Spain, where there was considerable scholarly interaction with visiting European translators until the defeat of the Moors in the 12th century ( see MEDIEVAL EUROPEAN ASTRONOMY ). The times and dates of Islamic religious activities are regulated according to a lunar calendar, and the first appearance of the new moon is of great importance. Pre- dictions of this and the preparation of almanacs regulating the hours of prayer led to a considerable interest in spheri- cal trigonometry, and the development of the modern trigonometric functions (although some originated in India) and the identities between them. Islamic astronomers did not make exhaustive observa- tions of the sky. They restricted their sightings, or at least those they chose to record, primarily to measurements that could be used for re-deriving key parameters of solar or planetary orbits. An impressive example of an Islamic astronomer working strictly within a Ptolemaic framework b ut establishing new values for Ptolemy’s parameters was Muhammad AL - BATTA ̄ NI ̄, a younger contemporary of Tha ̄b it ibn Qurra. Al-Batta ̄nı ̄’s Zı ̄j (‘[Astronomical] Ta bles’) was one of the most important works of astrono- my between the time of Ptolemy and the Renaissance – Nicholas COPERNICUS cites his 9th-century predecessor no fewer than 23 times. By contrast, one of the greatest astronomers of medieval Islam, ‘Ali ibn ‘Abd al-Rahma ̄n ibn Yu ̄ nus (950–1009), remained virtually unknown to European astronomers until around 1800. Working in Cairo a century after al-Batta ̄nı ̄, Ibn Yu ̄ nus wrote a major astronomical handbook called the Hakimi zı ̄j . Unlike other Islamic astronomers, he prefaced his zı ̄j with a series of more than a hundred observations, mostly of eclipses and planetary conjunctions. Ptolemy’s Almagest had contained a catalogue of over a thousand stars. The first critical revision of this catalogue wa s carried out in the 10th century by Abu’l-Husain AL - SU ̄ FI ̄. His Kita ̄b suwar al-kawa ̄ kib al-tha ̄ bita (‘Book on the Constellations of the Fixed Stars’) followed Ptolemy’s often faulty list, but it did give improved magnitudes. The book’s splendid pictorial representations became known in the Latin West; it also contains the first known repre- sentation of the Andromeda Galaxy. Although most Islamic astronomers remained securely within the geocentric framework of Ptolemy and Aristotle, some criticized particular technical details of the PTOLEMA - IC SYSTEM which seemed to violate the ancient belief that only uniform circular motion can explain the movements of celestial bodies. One of the first critics was the physicist Ibn al-Haytham (965?– c .1041), known in the West as Alhazen, who held the planetary models of Ptolemy’s Almagest to be false. Later, Muhammad ibn Rushd (1126–98), known in the West as Averroës, declared that Ptolemy’s eccentrics and epicycles were ‘contrary to nature’. A fresh attack on the Ptolemaic system was undertaken in the 13th century by Nası ̄r al-Dı ̄n AL - TU ̄ SI ̄. A prolific writer with 150 known titles to his credit, al-Tu ̄sı ̄ con- structed a major observatory at Mara ̄ gha (in present-day Iran). Other astronomers at the Mara ̄ gha observatory also offered new arrangements of circles, but a fully acceptable alternative (from a philosophical point of view) did not come until the work of Ibn al-Sha ̄ tir (1304–75/6) at Dam- ascus around 1350. Although al-Sha ̄ tir’s solution, as well as the work of the Mara ̄ gha observatory, remained gener- ally unknown in the West, this and other Islamic criticisms of Ptolemy may have had an influence on Copernicus. Conspicuous examples of modern astronomy’s Islamic heritage are found in its vocabulary in terms such as ‘nadir’ and ‘zenith’, but in particular in the names of stars: Betel- geuse, Rigel, Aldebaran and Altair are just a few of the star names that are Arabic in origin or are Arabic translations of Ptolemy’s Greek descriptions. (Some of the names as we have them today bear little resemblance to their original forms, having been corrupted in transliteration and by cen- turies of transcription.) Many of these star names begin with ‘Al-’ because al is Arabic for ‘the’. The Arabic star nomenclature entered the West by another route – the making of ASTROLABES , on which star names were inscribed. The earliest dated astrolabe in Arabic dates from 927–928. It is primarily from Spain that astrolabe-making, together with Arabic names for the stars, reached the West via England in the late 13th and 14th centuries. isostasy Principle that recognizes there to be a state of balance between topographic masses and the underlying materials that support them. Higher elevations tend to be supported by material of lower density; for example, continental crust is less dense than oceanic crust and is also thicker, and mountain ranges have ‘roots’ of crustal material extending downwards towards the mantle. The depth of such features can be deduced from precise measurements of local variations in the gravity field. The concept owes much to the work of Sir George AIRY .

Jansky, Karl Guthe (1905–50) American radio engineer, whose detection of radio waves from the Milky Way marked the beginning of RADIO ASTRONOMY . In 1928 Jansky joined the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, after g raduating from the University of Wisconsin. He made his his- toric discovery with a rotating antenna that received both very short radio waves (20.5 MHz) and much longer waves (45 kHz), which he was using to search for the cause of static that interfered with ship-to-shore and other kinds of telecom- munications. He identified three kinds of static. The first two w ere associated with thunderstorms: localized storms, and more distant storms whose radio noise was reflected by the ionosphere. The third kind, a steady hiss, was initially a mys- tery, but Jansky noticed that it reached a maximum intensity every 23 h 56 m , the SIDEREAL PERIOD . J ansky noted that during the solar eclipse on 1932 August 31, the intensity of the waves did not decrease, as it would have done if the radio emission came from the Sun. Also, the hiss was strongest along the galactic plane, especially at a right ascension of around 18 h , in Sagittarius – the likely centre of the MILKY WAY already identified by Harlow SHAPLEY and Jan OORT . Janksy concluded that g iant ionized clouds of INTERSTELLAR MATTER in the Milky Way were producing the static, marking the birth of the new science of radio astronomy. Although this made the front page of the New York Times , there was little inter- est from the scientific community. Jansky himself failed to see the potential of his discovery. It was taken up, initially single-handedly, by Grote REBER , and only after World Wa r II did radio astronomy really take off. To honour Jan- sky, the IAU in 1973 adopted his name for the unit of flux density of extraterrestrial radio emissions. jansky (symbol Jy) Unit of FLUX DENSITY adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1973 in honour of Karl JANSKY .

Janssen, (Pierre) Jules (César) (1824–1907) French astronomer who invented the spectrohelioscope and, independently of Norman LOCKYER , discovered the spec- tral line of helium in the solar chromosphere. Originally a b usinessman, he turned to solar astronomy after hearing of the spectroscopic discoveries of Gustav KIRCHHOFF . J anssen built an observatory in 1862 atop his house at Montmartre to investigate the dark bands in the Sun’s spectrum. Using a five-prism spectroscope, Janssen was able to resolve the bands into fine lines that were most intense during sunrise and sunset, when the Sun was observed through the thickest layers of the Earth’s atmos- phere, and identified water vapour in the atmosphere as the source of these TELLURIC LINES . On an expedition to India, Janssen used a spectro- scope to study solar prominences visible during the 1868 August total eclipse, demonstrating that the bright lines in their spectra indicated a gaseous nature. He re-exam- ined these lines by constructing a spectrohelioscope, with which the prominences could be observed spectro- scopically without waiting for a total eclipse. Janssen observed three bright yellow lines in their spectra, two of which were already identified with the element sodium; the third, previously undiscovered, was attributed by Lockyer to a new chemical element, called helium, not discovered on Earth until 1895. Two years later, during the Franco–Prussian War, Janssen escaped the besieged city of Paris in a balloon, intending to observe the1870 December total solar eclipse in Algeria. During the 1874 and 1882 transits of Venus, he obtained multiple images of the planet in rapid succession using a technique that w as a forerunner of cinematography. His collection of more than six thousand superb solar photographs taken between 1876 and 1903 was published as Atlas du pho- tographies solaires (1904). Janssen helped to establish the MEUDON OBSERVATORY (1875) and another at Mont Blanc (1893–95), which was later known as the PIC DU MIDI OBSERVATORY . Janus One of the inner satellites of SATURN , identified in 1980 in VOYA GER 1 images. It may have been observed earlier, in 1966, by Audouin Dollfus. It is spheroidal in shape, measuring about 200 \u0002 180 \u0002 150 km (120 \u0002 110 \u0002 90 mi). Janus has a near-circular orbit, with a very slight tilt to Saturn’s equator (inclination only 0º.14), at an average distance of 151,500 km (94,100 mi) from the planet’s centre, giving it an orbital period of 0.695 days. It is co-orbital with EPIMETHEUS ; the two may be derived from a single split body. See also CRUITHNE Jeans, James Hopwood (1877 – 1946) English theoret- ical physicist who developed advanced mathematical models to attack many fundamental astrophysical prob- lems. Jeans’ first major theoretical work, published while he was at Trinity College, Cambridge, used statistical mechanics to explain the behaviour of gas molecules. Since many astrophysical objects, including stars and neb- ulae, are largely composed of gas, this kinetic theory of gases became widely used by astronomers investigating the structure of stellar interiors and the interstellar medi- um. A report written by Jeans in 1914 helped the QUAN - TUM THEORY to become accepted. He then began a long study of rotating fluid masses, b uilding on previous work by, among others, George Howard Darwin (1845–1912) and Édouard R OCHE . This led him to reject the NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS of Pierre Simon de LAPLACE by showing that the rotating pear- shaped mass required by this theory was dynamically unstable. Jeans proposed instead that the Solar System formed after another star passed close by our Sun and violently removed some of its matter, which subsequent- ly coalesced into the planets. This tidal theory was later extended by Harold JEFFREYS . In 1928 Jeans proposed CONTINUOUS CREATION , a concept that laid the founda- tions for the STEADY - STATE THEORY of cosmology, though it was left to others, including Fred HOYLE , fully to develop that model. Jeans concluded his life in astron- omy by writing popular books, including The Universe Around Us (1929), The Mysterious Universe (1930) and Through Space and Time (1934), and radio broadcasts aimed at a general audience. Jeffreys, Harold (1891–1989) British physicist who developed models for the structure and evolution of the Earth and the Solar System. His work in hydrodynamics and geophysics led him to extend James JEANS ’ tidal h ypothesis for the origin of the Solar System. This theory suggests that the passage of stars close to the Solar System triggers the formation of planets. Jeffreys also proposed models of the circulation of Earth’s atmosphere and the a tmospheres of the outer planets.

It ow es its origin (and its name) to rocket experiments car- ried out by Theodor VO N KÁRMÁN in the 1930s in a canyon near Pasadena, California. Spurred by the onset of World War II, the laboratory conducted missile experi- ments on the site and it grew rapidly, eventually flying the first successful US spacecraft, EXPLORER 1, in January 1958. When NASA was created the following December, JPL was transferred to the new space agency from US Army control, bringing expertise in building and flying spacecraft, propulsion systems, guidance, systems inte- gration and space telecommunications. JPL is NASA’s centre of excellence for deep-space systems, and its broad remit covers most aspects of unmanned US space missions. It has been responsible for the high-profile planetary probes of the past few decades, and continues this role with such future pro- jects as deep impact and EUROPA ORBITER . It also plays a major role in space observatories such as the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE and the SPACE INFRARED TELESCOPE FA CILITY , as well as Earth science satellites such as Terra, CloudSat and GRACE (the Gravity Recovery And Cli- mate Experiment). jets Long, thin gaseous structures characterized by radio emission and/or optical nebulosity. There are always two jets, but one may be hidden by the central object or disrupted by the medium through which it travels. Jets are usually collimated (kept straight) and confined by strong magnetic fields or winds, and the rotation of the central object plays a significant role. Jets arise from two vastly different situations. In highly luminous RADIO GALAXIES (double-lobed radio sources) and QU ASARS , two jets of highly superson- ic, energetic electrons bore into the ambient intergalactic medium. The jets remain collimated unless the sur- rounding gas causes wiggles and bends by refraction, or until they impact upon sufficiently dense material so that they dissipate much of their energy in shocks, creating radio ‘hot spots’ of SYNCHROTRON RADIATION within the large radio LOBES . Sometimes galaxies even generate knots along their jets that can be seen as optical nebulae. The jet of M87 is 8000 l.y. long, and the Hubble Space Telescope is able to image knots and features as small as 10 l.y. across in the jet. The jets connect the radio lobes to the centre of the galaxy, and they are thought to be powered by a BLACK HOLE at its centre. The central engine is able to pump the jets in the same two directions for periods of order 100 million years. At times the velocity of the material in the jets of M87, and from sev- eral quasars, appears to be greater than the speed of light. This SUPERLUMINAL motion is actually a geometric effect, and it requires the jet to be pointing almost direct- ly at Earth (within 10º). This may mean that more objects have jets than expected, but they are not see because they are not pointing towards Earth. A second generator of jets is a low-luminosity PROTO - STAR . The material around the fledgling protostar col- lapses on to the star, helping to initiate the nuclear fusion reaction that turns hydrogen into helium. This reaction reverses the infall, and eventually an outflow occurs. The wind is millions of times stronger than the SOLAR WIND , and is usually supersonic, so that shock waves are pro- duced in the interstellar medium where the jet impacts. The shocked clumps of material are called HERBIG – HARO OBJECTS ; they can be as small as the size of the Solar Sys- tem, and the mass of the Earth. The clumps have been found to be variable: they can be seen to move and change over several years. The protostar itself is invisible, hidden behind a thick cocoon of dust and probably with a large dust disk, but it is assumed that the jets leave the system along the rotational axis of the star. The material in the jets can be detected in the optical, infrared and radio regions, with the radio observations highlighting the presence of magnetic fields. jet stream Narrow belt of high-speed wind in a planetary ATMOSPHERE . On Earth, the jet streams that have the greatest influence on the surface weather, including the development, motion and decay of depressions, are two westerly jets, the subtropical and polar jet streams, in each hemisphere. These typically occur as discontinuous segments around the Earth, thousands of kilometres long, hundreds of kilometres wide, and a few kilometres deep. They lie in the upper TROPOSPHERE and lower STRATOSPHERE , often being located where there is a break in the TROPOPAUSE . Seasonal jets, such as the easterly equatorial and the westerly polar-night jet streams, also occur within the stratosphere. On Earth, jet stream wind speeds generally lie in the range 160–320 km/h (100–200 mph), with a recorded extreme of 656 km/h (408 mph). Far higher speeds, sometimes in excess of 1400 km/h (870 mph), have been observed on Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune. Jewel Box Name given to the KAPPA CRUCIS CLUSTER by John HERSCHEL . Jodrell Bank Observatory Major radio astronomy facility of the University of Manchester and the location of Britain’s most famous scientific instrument, the Lovell Telescope . The Jodrell Bank site, 32 km (20 mi) south of Manchester, was selected by Bernard LOVELL in 1945 as a suitable location from which to observe cosmic rays. He used ex-army radar equipment to try to detect the rays, but instead found reflections from meteors. Building on this experience, he constructed a 66-m (218-ft) fixed parabolic aerial in 1947 and, in 1957, the fully steerable 76-m (250-ft) dish known originally as the Mark I telescope that now bears his name. Both tele- scopes were the largest of their kind in the world when built, and the 250-ft telescope immediately became famous through its tracking of SPUTNIK 1. Outstanding debts on the telescope were eventually cleared by the Nuffield Foundation, and what had been called the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station became the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories . A second fully steerable radio telescope, the 26-m (85-ft) Mark II, was completed in 1964 and, together with a third telescope at Nantwich, began pioneering work on long-baseline interferometry. The Multi-Tele- scope Radio-Linked Interferometer project of 1976 extended this work to several other sites with telescopes operated by Jodrell Bank. In the early 1990s, this array (now renamed MERLIN ) was extended to include a new 32-m (105-ft) telescope at Cambridge. In the meantime, the Mark I had been upgraded and renamed the Lovell Telescope on its 30th anniversary.

Johnson, Harold Lester (1921–80) American astronomer who co-invented the UBV PHOTOMETRY sys- tem used to analyse the physical properties of stars and galaxies. Johnson was an electronics expert who designed and built many kinds of photometer. He improved the sensitivity of the detectors used in these instruments and found innovative ways of reducing the ‘noise’ that inter- fered with photometric observations. Johnson also designed and built a prototype of the first multiple mir- ror telescope, installed in the 1970s at the Mexican National Observatory. W orking with William W. MORGAN in the early 1950s, he developed the UBV SYSTEM for measuring stellar mag- nitudes in three basic colours or wavebands: U (ultravio- let), B (blue) and V (visual, or yellow). Later, Johnson extended the system to include the R (red) and I (near- infrared) bands, then to additional bands out to 4 \u0001 m, known as J, K and L. Johnson and his colleagues mea- sured thousands of ‘reference stars’ with the UBV and UBVRI photometry systems, and they were able to cali- brate the spectral energy distributions (‘absolute energy curves’), resulting in more accurate stellar temperature scale. Using his new system of photometry, Johnson evolved powerful tools for analysing stars and clusters of stars by plotting their apparent visual magnitudes against B–V differences or ‘indices’ (colour–magnitude diagram) or U–B index versus B–V index (colour–colour dia- g ram). He was able to estimate the ages of clusters from their colour–magnitude diagrams. The same principles w ere applied to studies of individual stars, and using these tools Johnson made many investigations involving carbon stars, subdwarfs, Cepheids and M stars, as well as structures like circumstellar shells.

Jones, Harold Spencer (1890–1960) English astronomer, the tenth ASTRONOMER ROYAL , who arranged the move of GREENWICH OBSERVATORY to Herstmonceux, and improved the value of the SOLAR PARALLAX . From 1923 to 1933 Jones served as His Majesty’s Astronomer at the Cape, South Africa. There he supervised studies of lunar occultations, using data accumulated between 1880 and 1922 to verify and correct the lunar constants calcu- lated by E.W. BROWN . He also measured the parallaxes, and hence distances, to hundreds of stars in the Milky Wa y. In 1933 Jones returned to England to become Astronomer Royal, retiring in 1955. J ones’ major lifetime project was a highly detailed analysis of tiny variations in the Earth’s rotation rate. He is most famous for his refinement of the solar parallax, and hence of the ASTRONOMICAL UNIT . In 1928 the IAU appointed him president of a commission to determine the solar parallax from observations to be made of the asteroid (433) Eros, which would be at opposition in 1931. Using thousands of visual and photographic obser- va tions from some fifty observatories in both hemi- spheres, Jones began a ten-year process of reduction and calculation that ranks as one of the most impressive calcu- lational feats of the pre-computer era. The result, announced in 1941, was 8 \u0002 .790, corresponding to a value for the AU of 149,670,000 km. Jovian Pe r taining to the planet Jupiter.

Joy measured the radial velocities for thousands of stars, including many Cepheid variables, which allowed him to determine the distance of the Solar System to the centre of the Milky Way.

JPL Abbreviation of JET PROPULSION LABORATORY Julian calendar CALENDAR devised by Julius Caesar and the Greek astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria in 45 BC . The system was based on a year of 365.25 days, fixed at 365 with a leap year of 366 days every four y ears to compensate. The year commenced on March 25. The calendar, which was completed by Caesar Augustus in 44 BC and adopted throughout the Roman Empire, established the present-day names, lengths and order of the months. The Julian calendar was in general use in the West until 1582, by which time the approximation to the true solar y ear of 365.24219 days had accumulated an error of ten days. It was superseded by the GREGORIAN CALENDAR but w as still used in the UK until 1752. Julian date Number of days that have passed since noon GMT on 4713 BC J anuary 1 (the JULIAN DAY number), plus the decimal fraction of a mean solar day that has elapsed since the preceding noon. For example, the Julian date at 18.00 UTC on 2000 January 1 was 2,451,545.25. The modified Julian date (MJD) is a shortened form, using only the last five digits of the full Julian date and commencing at 0 h UTC on 1858 November 17. The modified Julian date at 18.00 UTC on January 1 therefore was 51544.75, the 0.5 difference being because the Julian date changes at noon but the MJD at midnight UTC.

Despite its early discovery, there are seven main-belt asteroids larger than Juno. Jupiter Largest planet in the Solar System; it is 318 times as massive as the Earth and revolves about the Sun in an orbit with an average radius of 5.203 AU. The orbital period is 11.86 years. At opposition, when Jupiter appears on the observer’s meridian at midnight, it subtends a diameter of about 47 \u0001 . Earth-based observers’ ability to resolve the disk allowed the polar and equatorial radii to be established at an early date and, using the mass derived from Newton’s law of gr a vity, the average density was determined. A volume equal to 1335 times that of the Earth and an average density of 1.31 g/cm 3 , less than one-fourth that of the Earth, indicated that internally Jupiter was not earthlike. Jupiter is markedly oblate, with equatorial diameter 142,800 km (88,800 mi) and polar diameter 133,500 km (83,000 mi). Early spectroscopic studies revealed that Jupiter’s spectrum was highly similar to that of the Sun. In 1932, however, Rupert Wildt (1905–76) identified absorption features of methane and ammonia in its spectrum. Multi- a tom molecules dissociate at high temperatures, so this discovery indicated that the observed spectrum was reflected sunlight from a cool planet with a molecular a tmosphere. Hydrogen molecules and helium atoms do not possess readily observable absorption features in visi- ble light; with access to infrared data, however, it has been ascertained that the composition of Jupiter, with respect to the relative abundance of hydrogen, helium, carbon and nitrogen, is solarlike. Because Jupiter revolves at an average distance from the Sun of 5.2 AU, the effective solar heating per unit area is reduced by a factor of 0.037 relative to the Earth. Utilizing the data from the PIONEER and VOYA GER mis- sions, the total light scattered in all directions by the plan- et can be accurately determined; thus, the total absorbed energy is known. When this is compared to the non-solar infrared component of Jupiter’s radiation, the ratio of emitted to absorbed solar radiation is 1.668 ± 0.085; that is, Jupiter emits 1.668 times as much heat as it receives. Hence, heat generated internally from decay of unstable isotopes or slow gravitational contraction enters the at mosphere from the interior of the planet. Even with its internal heat source, the outer regions of Jupiter’s atmosphere are extremely cold, with the cloud- deck temperature near 150 K. The visible cloud deck occurs at a depth of about one bar of pressure and is composed mainly of ammonia ice. Beneath this deck temperatures and pressures increase inwards. At a depth of 5–10 bars the water cloud cycle should occur, moving energy from the deeper regions by convection and con- densing and releasing the energy at higher levels. At still deeper levels the gaseous atmosphere becomes a liquid ocean, which eventually changes into a region composed chiefly of hydrogen and helium. Under the large pres- sures due to gravitational force on the overburden, this region exhibits a crystalline structure and is a good con- ductor of heat. It is referred to as the ‘metallic hydrogen’ core. At the centre of the planet is thought to be a dense central core of about 15 Earth masses, comprising the heavy elements, which have migrated inwards. Results from the GALILEO orbital mission have improved our knowledge of the Jovian system dramatically. The first detection of radio emissions from Jupiter w as made in 1955 by B.F. Burke and K.L. Franklin. These emissions are concentrated in wavelengths of tens of metres (called decametric) and tenths of metres (deci- metric). The decametric emission is caused by electrical discharges along the Jovian field lines when IO crosses them.

Based on this data, a standard rotating co-ordinate system, SYSTEM III , has been selected by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The zero longitude has been chosen, corre- sponding to the central meridian of the planet at 0 h UT on 1965 January 1. Longitude has been defined to increase with time at a rate of 870º.536 per 24 hours. Within this system, the latitude and longitude of small eddies within the cloud deck can be measured as a func- tion of time; thus the prevailing winds can be derived. These measurements are interpreted as atmospheric motions relative to the interior of the planet, and, if fully understood, they could reveal a great deal about energy transport within the planet. Av erage zonal winds are characterized by strong east- w ards winds within 10º of the equator and a series of alternating westwards and eastwards jets extending towards the poles. At latitudes equatorwards of 40º, bright zones are bounded on the equatorwards side by a w estwards jet and on the polewards side by an eastwards jet. These regions have anticyclonic flow and are equiva- lent to upwelling regions in the Earth’s atmosphere. The brown intervening belts have cyclonic shear and, by analogy, should be regions of downwards flow where ammonia ice melts. Detailed photometric studies indi- cate that there is an aerosol haze extending from high altitudes to below the cloud deck. This haze contributes a yellowish-brown coloration to the planet. The size of the particles and the depth to which the line-of-sight penetrates play a large role in determining the hue and shade of a specific cloud feature. The number of times the reflected photons have been scattered off particles and the amount of ammonia ice located at high eleva- tions both play a role in the observed ALBEDO . Individual cloud features within the Jovian atmos- phere are large and long-lived. A low effective tempera- ture causes Jupiter to lose the excess energy that is brought up by convection cells more slowly than does the Earth’s atmosphere; however, this does not explain the extreme longevity of some cloud systems. The most w ell-known feature is the GREAT RED SPOT , centred at about 22ºS. Nested between a westwards wind along the northern edge and an eastwards wind on the south, this g iant elliptical cloud system rotates in a counter-clock- wise, or anticyclonic, sense. To a large extent, the visibil- ity of the Great Red Spot is determined by the amount of turbulence present in the westwards jet deflected around its northern perimeter. White eddies enter the feature during periods of active convection, rendering the con- trast so low that detection is difficult. Actually, the Great Red Spot reflects no more red light than do the sur- rounding white clouds. Its uniqueness lies in the fact that the circulation of the feature brings to the surface some unknown constituent that is a strong ultraviolet and vio- let absorber; hence observing through a broad-band vio- let haze filter enhances the visibility of the feature.

Many models have been proposed to explain the long-lived well-defined cloud features. These models deal with stable wave solutions and energy and momentum transport. Direct sampling of the Jovian atmosphere by the entry probe released from Galileo in 1995 December allowed measurements of its composition to be made to an accu- racy better than one percent. Hydrogen and helium are present in essentially solar proportions, along with molec- ular species including CH 4 , NH 3 and H 2 S. These molec- ular species, together with S 2 and various metals, were dredged up from depth by the SHOEMAKER – LEVY 9 impacts in 1994 July. A ring system was discovered during the 1979 VOY - A GER 1 encounter, with the brightest component, com- prising micrometre-sized particles lying in the equatorial plane, being 7000 km (4000 mi) wide, and located 129,000 km (80,000 mi) from the planet’s centre. Jupiter’s magnetic field is similar to that of the Earth. To a first order of approximation, it can be represented as a tilted dipole that is 10 times stronger than the Earth’s field. Deviations from a dipole shape and failure of the magnetic axis to be aligned with the rotation axis or to pass through the centre of mass indicate that complex structure may occur deep in the interior. Interaction of the magnetic field with the SOLAR WIND causes particles to decelerate and become entrapped in the magnetic field, creating a complex region around the planet, the MAGNETOSPHERE . The high velocities of the entrapped particles create a hazard for exploring spacecraft, because high-speed electrons, protons and alpha parti- cles can penetrate the craft and cause electronic or radia- tion damage. The shape of the magnetic field has been sampled only near the equatorial plane by the Pioneer, Vo y ager and Galileo spacecraft. Advance planning for a Jo vian polar orbiter has begun. Ongoing research to obtain a model that is self-consis- tent involves several major regions of the planet. Within the deep core, problems concerning the nature of the contaminated hydrogen–helium alloy and the manner in which it conducts heat outwards are challenging. How this region interfaces with a convective envelope, and the degree to which the rapid rotation introduces an orga- nized cylindrical circulation about the axis of rotation within the envelope, is under investigation. The manner in which the envelope couples with the atmosphere, and the degree to which the dynamics of the atmosphere is driven from below, are an area of active research and con- troversy. As we continue to explore the Solar System, comparison of Jupiter with the other gas giants – Saturn, Uranus and Neptune – will enhance our understanding of this giant planet. Jupiter-crossing asteroid Any of a group of asteroids with orbital paths that cross some part of the orbital path of JUPITER . Because of Jupiter’s huge mass, lifetimes on such orbits are very limited (of the order of tens of thousands of years only), with most of these asteroids quickly being diverted on to radically altered trajectories or ejected from the Solar System entirely. The result is that very few Jupiter-crossing asteroids exist in any epoch.

Forced to work for room and board as a tutor after his father died, Kant studied the philosophy of science at the University of Königsberg, where he later became professor of logic and metaphysics. In 1754 he suggested that the Moon’s tide-raising forces cause its ‘near’ hemisphere always to face the Earth and that these same frictional forces have the long-term effect of slowing down the Earth’s rotation rate. In 1755 Kant pub- lished Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens , the first comprehensive model of the Milky Way’s structure. Commenting on the cosmological theories of Thomas WRIGHT of Durham, who argued that the bright band of light crossing the night sky consisted of innumerable suns in a disk-shaped distribution, Kant concluded that the Solar System lies in that plane of stars or very near it. He likened our Galaxy to the structure of the Solar System, where the planets are also approximately in the same plane. The Milky Way, he said, was lens-shaped, its appearance deter- mined by our perspective in space. Kant is usually credited with coining the term ‘island universe’ to describe our Galaxy as it related to the other patches of nebulous light that we now know are other galaxies. In his magnum opus, Critique of Pure Reason (1781), he maintained that cosmol- ogists cannot ascertain with absolute certainty the finiteness or infinity of space and time. Kappa Crucis Cluster (NGC 4755) Open star cluster in the southern constellation Crux (RA 12 h 53 m .6 dec. \u0001 60º20 \u0002 ); it was first recorded by Nicolas LACAILLE in 1751–52. The cluster, also known as the Jewel Box because of its colourful stars, is young (estimated age 7.1 million years) and contains several luminous O- and B-class giants. Its apparent diameter is 10 \u0002 and mag. \u0003 4.2. The Kappa Crucis Cluster lies at a distance of 7600 l.y. Kappa Cygnids Minor METEOR SHOWER , with a zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) less than 10, active between August 17 and 26, with a peak around August 20. The shower is noted for producing occasional bright, slow- moving FIREBALLS . Kapteyn, Jacobus Cornelius (1851–1922) Dutch astronomer renowned for his work in photographic astrometry and for introducing statistical methods in stel- lar astronomy. As the founder of the University of Groningen’s Observatory in 1878, Kapteyn found himself with neither equipment nor research facilities. He there- fore set about participating in international programmes of observation so as to accumulate large amounts of observational data, and developing mathematical tech- niques for reducing the data and statistical methods of handling them. A major collaboration (1885–97) was with David GILL to reduce the photographic positions of almost half a million southern-hemisphere stars. For this project, which yielded the CAPE PHOTOGRAPHIC DURCH - MUSTERUNG , Kapteyn invented a PLATE - MEASURING MACHINE that automatically converted photographic plate coordinates into real star positions and allowed accurate comparisons of stellar magnitudes from one plate to another. He made unprecedentedly accurate distance measurements for large numbers of stars in the Hyades and Perseus Double Cluster, allowing him to determine exactly which stars belonged to these clusters. In the course of 10,000 measurements of proper motions he dis- covered KAPTEYN ’ SSTAR , at a distance of only 12.7 l.y. the nearest subdwarf to the Solar System. Kapteyn’s statistical investigations led to his discovery in 1904 of two ‘star streams’ in the Milky Way moving in opposite directions. Later astronomers such as Jan oort and Bertil LINDBLAD concluded that this streaming meant that the Galaxy had DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION about its central nucleus. With Pieter Johannes van Rhijn (1886–1960), Kapteyn studied the distribution of stars in the Galaxy by counting numbers of stars visible in differ- ent directions, by essentially the same method as used by William HERSCHEL . Their model of the Milky Way was too small by about one-third because they were unable to account correctly for the effects of interstellar reddening of starlight, which makes stars look closer than they really are. In 1906 Kapteyn announced his plan to make sys- tematic statistical studies of stars in 206 so-called Selected Areas (later extended to 252) to gain a better picture of the structure of our Galaxy. Kapteyn’s Star Star with the second-largest proper motion known, 8 \u0004 .7 per year, covering a distance on the celestial sphere equivalent to the apparent diameter of the Moon in just over 200 years. It is a red dwarf of spectral type M0 V, with only 0.4% of the Sun’s luminosity. Its visual magnitude is 8.86 and it lies 12.8 l.y. away in the southern constellation Pictor.

He specialized in spectroscopy, the study of nebulae and planetary research. His spectroscopic study of Saturn (1895) revealed different Doppler shifts in the inner and outer parts of the ring system, showing that it did not rotate at a single rate, supporting the theory of J ames Clerk MAXWELL that the rings were composed of many individual particles. Kellner eyepiece Eyepiece with large EYE RELIEF , which makes it widely used for binoculars as well as telescopes. It is essentially a RAMSDEN EYEPIECE with one element replaced by an achromatic doublet. Like the Ramsden, the Kellner is prone to GHOSTING , caused by internal reflec- tions within the eyepiece. It is, however, popular with many observers. It was invented in 1849 by the German optician Carl Kellner (1826–55). Kelvin, Lord (William Thomson) (1824–1907) Scot- tish mathematical physicist who gave his name to the Kelvin TEMPERATURE SCALE , based on absolute zero. When just fifteen years old, the University of Glasgow aw arded Kelvin its Gold Medal for his ‘Essay on the Fig- ure of the Earth’, an amazingly sophisticated work on geo- detics, and in 1846 he was elected professor there. He proposed his temperature scale in 1848 during the course of thermodynamical studies with the physicist George Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903). Apart from his major influ- ence on physics, Kelvin made contributions to astronomy. He analysed the second law of thermodynamics, conclud- ing (1849–52) that if ENTROPY always increases, this w ould result in the HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE , from which it would not be possible to observe or measure any information about its physical state. He made one of the first properly scientific attempts at estimating the age of the Earth, based on known cooling rates of materials, although his result (20–400 million years) was far too low. Kennedy Space Center (KSC) NATIONAL AERONAU - TICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) facility for the preparation and launch of US manned space missions and its spaceport technology centre. Located at the Cape Canaveral Spaceport, Florida (on Merritt Island, north of Cape Canaveral itself), the site was selected for guided missile tests in 1947, but the main complex was commis- sioned in 1961 as the launch facility for the APOLLO PRO - GRAMME . It was named after former president John F. Kennedy. The KSC is NASA’s centre of excellence for launch and payload processing systems and the lead cen- tre for the management of expendable launch vehicle ser- vices. It is best known for handling the check-out, launch and landing of the SPACE SHUTTLE and its payloads. The HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE , the CHANDRA X - RAY OBSERVA - TORY and the modules of the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STA - TION all passed through the facility. Kennelly–Heaviside layer (Heaviside layer) Term formerly used to denote either the whole of Earth’s IONOSPHERE or a single region (the E - LAYER ) within it. After Guglielmo Marconi’s successful transmission of radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean, Arthur Edwin Kennelly (1861–1939) and Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925) suggested that an electrically conducting region existed in the A TMOSPHERE at high altitudes capable of reflecting radio waves back to Earth. Kepler, Johannes (1571–1630) German astronomer and mathematician, remembered for his three laws of planetary motion. A convert to Copernicanism, he became in 1600 assistant to Tycho BRAHE , who died the next year. Kepler then began the task of completing tables of predicted planetary positions begun by Tycho. From Tycho’s accurate observations Kepler concluded that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit, and went on to establish in 1609 the first of his laws of planetary motion ( KEPLER ’ SLAWS ). Speculations on magnetism led him to the second of these laws, and his desire to match celestial and musical harmony led to the third, published in 1619. The Rudolphine Tables , based on Tycho’s observations and Kepler’s laws, appeared in 1627 and remained the most accurate planetary tables until the 18th century. Kepler also studied the supernova of 1604 (known as KEPLER ’ SSTAR ), and made important contributions to optics and the theory of the telescope. J ohann von Kappel (though he is now always known by the Latinized version of his name) was born at Weil der Stadt, near Stuttgart. His father was a mercenary who w as apparently killed while fighting in Holland when J ohannes was only five, and the boy was raised by his mother at her father’s inn. A precocious child, Kepler obtained a scholarship in 1587 to Tübingen University. There he showed himself to be an able mathematician, and though he began studying Protestant theology after gaining his master’s degree, he was nominated provincial mathematician and teacher of mathematics at the Luther- an school in Graz. Despite his mixed views on astrology (he called it ‘the foolish little daughter of astronomy’), Kepler followed fashion and provided astrological predic- tions about the weather, peasant uprisings and Turkish invasions – all of which happened to be fulfilled. Casting horoscopes would later bring Kepler the income he need- ed to pursue his astronomical work. At Tübingen, he was influenced by the professor of astronomy, Michael Mästlin (1550–1631), who was well ve r sed in Copernicus’ HELIOCENTRIC THEORY . Kepler was fired with enthusiasm for the Copernican idea that the Earth and the other planets orbit the Sun. Despite being twice excommunicated from the Lutheran Church, Kepler remained a lifelong believer in a divine plan for the cosmos, and came upon what seemed to him a proof of the idea. He found that the sizes of the spheres upon Keck Telescopes 216 K \u0001 Kennedy Space Center The 1994 November 3 launch of Atlantis on Space Shuttle Mission STS-66.

Between the spheres of Saturn and Jupiter, a cube could be fitted; between Jupiter and Mars, a tetrahedron (solid with four faces); and so on. This grand design was pub- lished in 1596 as Mysterium cosmographicum (‘The Mys- tery of the Universe’), establishing Kepler’s reputation as a brilliant mathematician. Religious upheavals in central Europe forced Kepler to leave Graz, and he visited Tycho in Benatky, outside Prague. Kepler recognized the superb precision of T ycho’s observations, and that their mathematical analysis w ould improve planetary theory. Tycho did not accept the Copernican theory ( see TYCHONIAN SYSTEM ), but was so impressed with Kepler’s abilities that in 1600 he invited him to become his assistant. Kepler accepted and, when T ycho died the next year, was appointed his successor as Imperial Mathematician. In 1604 a supernova appeared in the constellation Ophiuchus, and in De stella nova Kepler described its astronomical and astrological aspects – his duties as Imperial Mathematician required him to provide the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II with astro- logical interpretations of astronomical phenomena. Dur- ing this period Kepler continued his analysis of Tycho’s observations of Mars, which had the greatest eccentricity, and hence most difficult orbit to explain, of all the known planets except Mercury. Kepler found that Tycho’s accurate data fitted neither the original version of the Copernican theory or Tycho’s o wn planetary scheme; after years of painstaking calcula- tions, he concluded in 1609 that Mars orbits the Sun, not in a perfect circle but in an ellipse. This was a fundamen- tal break with tradition, for previously everyone had fol- lowed the Greeks in believing that the planets move in circular orbits and, moreover, at an unvarying rate. Kepler also showed this to be untrue. The orbital velocity of Mars was greatest when closest to the Sun in its ellipti- cal path, at perihelion, and slowest when at its most dis- tant, at aphelion. Kepler went on to examine Tycho’s body of observations to determine whether the other planets moved in elliptical orbits. He found that they did – a result he formulated in what we now know as Kepler’s first law of planetary motion. Having taken the important step of letting observations determine his planetary theories, Kepler next sought a physical explanation for the planets’ elliptical orbits. He speculated about a magnetic force emanating from the Sun, sweeping the planets round as the Sun rotated. This w as incorrect, but it led Kepler to formulate an equation for orbital velocity which, though accurate only at aphe- lion and perihelion, brought him to his second law of planetary motion: that the line from Sun to planet (the radius vector), sweeps out equal areas of the ellipse in equal times. He published these first two laws in Astrono- mia nova (1609). With the idea of a divinely harmonious Universe in mind, he managed to fit the different orbital ve locities at aphelion and perihelion to the musical scale in an attempt to achieve a ‘celestial harmony’, and derived what seemed to him an example of divine law – the rela- tionship between a planet’s distance from the Sun and the time it takes to complete an orbit. First appearing in Har- monices mundi (‘Harmonies of the World’, 1619), Kepler’s third law states that for any two planets the ratio of the squares of their orbital periods equals the ratio of the cubes of their mean orbital radii. The seven-volume Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae (1617–21) was Kepler’s longest and most influential book. Reprinted in 1635, it was the one of the few acces- sible systematic accounts of the Copernican theory. It also contained detailed expositions of Kepler’s laws and his theory of the Moon’s motion. His Rudolphine Tables (1627) are generally regarded as the first modern truly scientific ephemeris of planetary positions: they synthe- sized the first two laws of planetary motion with Kepler’s reductions of Tycho’s data, and remained in use until the 18th century. Kepler wrote two important works on optics, including Astronomia pars optica (1604), which contains the first application of the technique known as ray-tracing to analyse optical systems. The second, Dioptrice (1611), w as a comment on GALILEO ’s Siderius nuncius in which he proposed his own design of telescope (now called the Kep- lerian telescope , still used in opera-glasses) which employed two convex lenses. His reviews of Galileo’s observations of Jupiter’s moons caused Kepler to coin the term ‘satellite’ (1610) to describe these minute bodies. Kepler wrote one of the first science fiction novels, the Somnium , which describes an imaginary trip to the Moon. All his life Kepler suffered from poor health. When his mother was tried for witchcraft, he went to help her, defending her with great success to his own advantage as w ell as hers, for her conviction would have damaged his career. Kepler ended his days in Regensburg, chronically short of money because of delays in the payment of his Imperial stipend.

Kepler still has a brilliant RAY system, which is most well developed towards the west; it is best observed at high Sun angles. The inner part of the EJECTA blanket is also easily identifiable, and best observed at low Sun angles. Kepler’s laws Three fundamental laws of planetary motion, announced by Johannes KEPLER in 1609 and 1618, deduced from observations made by Tycho BRAHE . (1) The planets move in elliptical orbits, the Sun being situated at one focus of the ellipse. (2) The radius v ector, an imaginary line joining the centre of the planet to the centre of the Sun, sweeps out equal areas in equal times (thus, a planet moves fastest when closest to the Sun). (3) The squares of the sidereal periods of the planets are proportional to the cubes of their mean distances from the Sun. These laws, which Kepler saw as of divine origin, dis- proved the PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM and vindicated the COPER - NICAN SYSTEM . The laws apply to all bodies in closed orbits around the Sun, and to satellites orbiting planets. Strictly, the laws only apply in the absence of perturba- tions by other planets and other sources.

See also POTENTIAL ENERGY Kirch family German astronomers, noted for compiling calendars, who played a leading role in founding astrono- my in what was then Prussia. Gottfried Kirch (1639–1710), who was taught by Johannes HEVELIUS , was the first astronomer at the Berlin Observatory (1700). He made the calculations for, and published, many astronom- ical ephemerides and calendars, and made detailed obser- vations of the 1699 comet. Gottfried’s wife, Maria Margarethe Kirch (1670–1720), assisted her husband in much of his ephemeris and calendar work, and also discovered a bright comet in 1702. Maria had taken up astronomy before meeting her husband, learning the science from the self-taught Christoph Arnold (1650–95). After her hus- band’s death in 1710, Maria worked with her son, Christ- fried Kirch (1694–1740), at the Berlin Academy. Christfried carried on the calendrical work of his parents and restored the observatory of Hevelius, from where he discovered the bright comet of 1723. He was assisted in his astronomical computations by his mother and his sis- ter Christine Kirch ( c .1696–1782). Kirchhoff, Gustav Robert (1824–87) German physi- cist, born in Königsberg (in modern Russia), a leading physicist of his time who, with Robert Wilhelm Eber- hardt Bunsen (1811–99), developed the techniques and principles of astronomical spectroscopy. After teaching at the universities of Berlin and Breslau, Kirchhoff fol- lowed Bunsen to Heidelberg to become professor of physics. The two men established the principles of analysing absorption and emission spectra, but it was Kirchhoff who saw its potential for astronomy. Even more relevant to astrophysics are his three gas laws, all announced in 1860. The first provides that a dense object produces a continuous ‘blackbody’ spectrum when heated. His second gas law says that a low-density excited gas will produce a bright emission-line spectrum as electrons lose energy. Kirchhoff ’s third gas law states that a continuous spectrum source will produce dark absorption lines as it passes through a cooler low-density gas. Using these laws Kirchhoff discovered the elements caesium and rubidium, named for the blue and red colours of their emission lines. Applying his gas laws to the solar atmosphere, Kirchhoff reached four important conclusions: (1) solar sodium atoms produce the orange-yellow Fraunhofer emission lines; (2) the Sun’s light is produced by a high-temperature gas; (3) dark absorption lines must come from a hot gas, but one which is cooler than the interior layers of our star; and (4) the dark absorption lines in the solar spectrum origi- nate as the cooler chromosphere absorbs photons from the photosphere below. Kirchhoff’s laws Laws of SPECTROSCOPY discovered by the German chemists Gustav KIRCHHOFF and Robert Bunsen (1811–99) and published in 1856. In essence they state that an incandescent solid, liquid or high- density gas emits a continuous spectrum, whereas a low- density gas emits or absorbs light at particular wa velengths only. Each element has its own characteristic pattern of lines. Thus stellar spectra have absorption lines arising from their low density outer layers; gaseous nebulae have emission line spectra.

While classifying the asteroids into families defined by their orbital parameters, Kirkwood noticed, as early as 1857, that very few asteroids had orbits in certain regions. He was able to show that perturbations induced by the powerful gravity of Jupiter preclude long- term stable orbits at the distances corresponding to these gaps. Kirkwood applied this same analysis to explain the gaps in Saturn’s ring system, calculating the tendency of Saturn’s satellites to constrain ring particles in well-defined zones, while excluding them from the gaps. Kirkwood gaps Largely vacant regions within the main belt of asteroids, in terms of their heliocentric distances, kept clear by gravitational perturbations caused by Jupiter. These distances are equivalent to orbital periods that are simple sub-dividers of Jupiter’s period, resulting in resonance effects that repel asteroids. These gaps were noticed by Daniel KIRKWOOD in 1857, their explanation in terms of celestial mechanics coming a decade later. Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO) US national research facility for ground-based optical astronomy. Located in the Quinlan Mountains 90 km (55 mi) south- w est of Tucson, Arizona, Kitt Peak was selected by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as an observatory site in 1958 after a nationwide site survey. It is operated jointly by the NSF and the ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITIES FOR RESEARCH IN ASTRONOMY . KPNO is one of the four divisions of the NATIONAL OPTICAL ASTRONOMY OBSERVA - TORY , and has headquarters in nearby Tucson. It now hosts the most diverse collection of telescopes on Earth for optical and infrared astronomy and daytime studies of the Sun. Of these, KPNO itself operates the 4-m (158-in.) Mayall Telescope (dedicated in 1973), the 3.5-m (138-in.) WIYN TELESCOPE (on behalf of the WIYN Con- sortium) and a 2.1-m (84-in.) reflector optimized for infrared as well as optical observations. As well as these large telescopes, there is a 0.9-m (36-in.) instrument (known as the Coudé Feed Tele- scope) which feeds light to the main spectrograph at the 2.1-m telescope, another 0.9-m (36-in.) telescope and the Burrell Schmidt telescope. A further 16 optical telescopes and two radio telescopes share the site; these are operated by the national solar observatory, the NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY and various other university consortia. Largest among them are the STEWARD OBSERVA - TORY ’s 2.3-m (90-in.) Bok Telescope (1969) and the 2.34-m (92-in) Hiltner Telescope, built for the Michigan- Dartmouth–MIT Observatory in 1986. Kleinmann–Low Nebula Nebula containing several strong infrared sources; it is situated behind the ORION NEBULA . It was first observed in 1967 by the American astronomers Douglas Kleinmann (1942– ) and Frank Low (1933– ). The Kleinmann–Low Nebula is a large dusty star-forming region. It has several distinct infrared sources within it, including the BECKLIN – NEUGEBAUER OBJECT . These sources are thought to be individual PROTOSTARS . Strong outflows within the nebula may be powered by the strongest of the infrared sources, IRc2. Kleopatra MAIN - BELT ASTEROID ; number 216. Radar imaging has shown that Kleopatra has a bizarre shape somewhat like a dog’s bone, 217 km (135 mi) long and 93 km (58 mi) wide. Kochab (Kocab) The star \u0001 Ursae Minoris, visual magnitude 2.08, distance 126 l.y., spectral type K4 III. Its name is of uncertain derivation. Kohoutek, Comet (C/1973 E1) Long-period comet discovered in 1973 by Lubos ˇ Kohoutek (1935– ), Hamburg, Germany, on photographic plates. Its relative brightness at the time of discovery, while still as distant from the Sun as Jupiter (5 AU), engendered forecasts that Comet Kohoutek would be a spectacular object in late December and early January. Perihelion (0.14 AU) w as reached on 28 December, at which time the comet reached mag. \u0002 3, and images were obtained using a coronagraph by Skylab astronauts. As it emerged into the evening sky after perihelion, Comet Kohoutek was a rapidly fading mag. \u0003 3.0 object. While it failed to live up to expectations, the comet was still a respectable binocular object, with a tail up to 25º long. The orbit of it is hyperbolic. Konkoly Observatory National observatory of Hun- gary, operated by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Its benefactor, Miklós Konkoly-Thege (1842–1916), donated his astronomical instruments to the state in 1899, and the observatory was established in Budapest after World War I. A 0.6-m (24-in.) reflector, still in use, began operations in 1928. In 1958 a dark-sky site, Piszkéstetôi Observatory, was set up in the Mátra Moun- tains about 120 km (75 mi) north-east of Budapest; three telescopes are currently operated there, including a 1.0-m (39-in.) built in 1974. Kopff, Comet 22P/ Short-period comet discovered photographically by August Kopff (1882–1960), Heidelberg, Germany, on 1906 August 23. The orbit has been modified by passages close to Jupiter in 1942 and 1954, and it has a current period of 6.45 years. It was last seen, as a diffuse magnitude \u0003 7.0 object, in 1996.

(1910– ) American radio astronomer noted for his design of radio antennae and receivers and his work with Ohio State University’s Big Ear radio tele- scope. Big Ear, built near Delaware, Ohio (1956–63), consisted of a large, flat surface tilted about its horizontal axis and reflecting signals to a fixed paraboloidal reflec- tor. It was demolished in 1998. From 1965 Kraus used Big Ear to make the most detailed map of the radio sky in history, discovering over 20,000 new sources of radio wa ve s.

KREEP Specific type of lunar material enriched in potassium (K), rare-earth elements (REE) and phosphorus (P). It was first found among the samples brought by APOLLO 12 astronauts. In its chemistry and b ulk mineralogy KREEP is a variety of lunar BASALT . It is believed to be formed from melt residue from the crystallization of large masses of crust and upper mantle materials of the Moon. Kreutz sungrazer Any of a group of COMETS with similar orbits that at perihelion lie within 0.01 AU (1.5 million km/1 million mi) of the Sun. The group was first recognized by the German astronomer Heinrich Carl Friedrich Kreutz (1854–1907) in 1888. Kreutz sungrazers have RETROGRADE orbits with periods of 500–1000 years; there are two principal subgroups. Kreutz sungrazers are believed to result from fragmentation in the remote past of a single large progenitor comet. The numerous smaller members of the group have been produced from further break up of the parent comet. SOHO spacecraft coronagraph observations have revealed large numbers of very small fragments on Kreutz sungrazer orbits. Larger fragments have produced some of the brightest comets in history, with C/1965 S1 IKEYA – SEKI being a noteworthy example. Their orbital inclination of 141º.9 means that Kreutz sungrazers are usually best observed after perihelion from southerly latitudes. Many sungrazers fail to survive the intense solar heating experienced close to perihelion. KSC Abbreviation of KENNEDY SPACE CENTER K star Any member of a class of yellow-orange stars, the spectra of which are characterized by weak hydrogen lines, with strong ionized calcium lines (Fraunhofer H and K) in the warmer K stars, and powerful neutral calcium (Fraunhofer g) and neutral sodium (Fraunhofer D) in the cooler ones. Molecular bands of CH (Fraunhofer G) and CN are also strong. Main-sequence dwarfs range from 4000 K at K9 to 5200 K at K0, with zero-age masses from 0.5 to nearly 0.9 solar mass, and luminosities from 0.1 to 0.5 solar. Dwarf lifetimes are longer than the age of the Galaxy. K giants and supergiants (because of lower densities typically 600 K cooler than the dwarfs) are distinguished from dwarfs by the prominent weakening of the CN absorption bands. Stellar luminosities are also found from the ‘Wilson–Bappu effect’, in which luminosities are directly tied to the width of a chromospheric emission line set within the broad ionized calcium H and K absorptions. K supergiants, which are rare because of rapid evolu- tion through the class, can range to high masses. Promi- nent among K giants are visually numerous helium-burning ‘clump stars’ of modest mass, which on the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM clump together near absolute magnitude zero. K subdwarfs have weakened metal lines and lower metal abundances. Except where they are members of short-period binary systems, most K stars are slow rotators. Some K giants are carbon rich: class R CARBON STARS , which begin at G5 temperatures, track fairly well the range of class K. Moderate carbon abundances combined with heavy-element excesses are found in the BARIUM STARS , which are enriched as a result of mass transfer from companions that have evolved to white dwarfs. Bright examples of K stars include Dubhe and Pollux KO III, Arcturus K1 III, Epsilon Pegasi K2 Ib, Alpha Centauri-B K1 V and Epsilon Eridani K2 V. Kuiper, Gerard Peter (1905–73) Dutch-American astronomer (born Gerrit Pieter Kuiper) responsible for revitalizing Solar System astronomy in an era dominated by stellar and galactic research. After studying astronomy at the University of Leiden with Bart BOK , Kuiper emi- gr a ted to the United States in 1933, joining the staff of Lick Observatory, where he concluded from studying stars of large parallax that at least half of all nearby stars are double or multiple systems. He invented the term ‘contact binary’ to describe the very close double star BETA LYRAE . Moving to the Yerkes Observatory in 1938, he tightened the definition of the mass–luminosity rela- tion, and concluded that white dwarfs are highly dense objects that behave differently from main-sequence stars. He was later director of Yerkes and of the McDonald Observatory, established by Yerkes in the darker skies of w est Texas in 1939. During World War II Kuiper used the large telescopes at Y erkes and McDonald for photographic studies of the planets and their satellites at wavelengths in the visual and near-infrared; his 1944 discovery of methane on Titan proved for the first time that planetary satellites could have atmospheres of their own. A string of Solar System discoveries followed: a tenuous CO 2 at mosphere on Mars, a fifth satellite of Uranus (Miranda), a second satellite of Neptune (Nereid) and methane in the atmos- pheres of Uranus and Neptune. In 1960 he fulfilled an early ambition to set up an institute devoted to Solar Sys- tem studies – the lunar and planetary laboratory (LPL) at the University of Arizona. Intimately involved in most of NASA’s space programmes, he was Chief Experimenter for the pioneering Ranger missions to the Moon. First at Y erkes and then at LPL, Kuiper directed the preparation of several important photographic lunar atlases that ensured the choice of safe sites for the Apollo landings. His search for superior observatory sites led to the CERRO T OLOLO INTER - AMERICAN OBSERVATORY in Chile and MAUNA KEA OBSERVATORY in Hawaii. He also initiated the use of telescopes in high-flying aircraft for infrared obser- va tions ( see KUIPER AIRBORNE OBSERVATORY ). Kuiper Airborne Observatory (KAO) Lockheed C- 141 transport aircraft containing a 91-cm (36-in.) short-focus Cassegrain reflecting telescope designed for INFRARED ASTRONOMY . The KAO was named in honour of Dutch-American astronomer Gerard KUIPER . It was operated from NASA’s AMES RESEARCH CENTER in California from 1975 to 1995. The KAO was used to discover the rings of Uranus, water vapour in Jupiter’s a tmosphere and Halley’s Comet, condensed cores in BOK GLOBULES , and more than 60 previously unobserved spectral features in the interstellar medium. Its successor is the STRATOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY FOR INFRARED ASTRONOMY (SOFIA). Kuiper belt See EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT Kwasan and Hida Observatories Observatories of Ky oto University, Japan. Kwasan Observatory dates from 1929, when it was established on Mount Kwasan in Ky oto city for solar and stellar research. Increasing light pollution led to Hida Observatory being set up in 1968 at Kamitakara, 350 km (220 mi) north-east of Kyoto, at an altitude of 1275 m (4180 ft). Hida has a 0.65-m (26-in.) refractor (the largest refractor in Asia, built in 1972), a 0.6-m (24-in.) reflector and the 0.6-m (24-in.) Domeless Solar Telescope (DST), built in 1979.

He led an expedition to the Cape of Good Hope (1750–54) where he formed 14 new southern constellations which he named after items of scientific equipment. The major achievement of this expedition w as the cataloguing of over 10,000 stars, published posthumously as Coelum australe stelliferum (1763). Using only small refractors, Lacaille also discovered 42 previously unknown nebulae, which he correctly deduced were objects within the Milky Way. He also postulated that the Magellanic Clouds are detached parts of our Galaxy. With Jérôme LALANDE , he measured the lunar parallax. Lacerta See feature article Lagoon Nebula (M8, NGC 6523) Bright EMISSION NEBULA surrounding the young open star cluster NGC 6530 in the constellation Sagittarius (RA 18 h 03 m .3 dec. \u0001 24º23 \u0002 ). The eastern half of the nebula is illuminated by hot O-class stars in NGC 6530, while the western half is illuminated by 9 Sagittarii. The Lagoon Nebula is divided by a broad lane of obscuring dark dust. First recorded by J ohn FLAMSTEED in 1680, the Lagoon has angular dimensions of 45 \u0002\u0003 30 \u0002 and mag. \u0004 6.0. It lies 5200 l.y. aw ay in the direction of the galactic centre, and covers an area of 60 \u0003 38 l.y. Lagrange, Joseph Louis (1736–1813) French mathematician, regarded as the 18th century’s greatest, born in Turin, Italy, where he did his early work. After serving as director of the Berlin Academy (1767–87), he emigrated to Paris, where he spent the rest of his life. His contributions to astronomy were in celestial mechanics, including the Moon’s libration, the gr a vitational interactions of Jupiter and its Galilean satellites, and the three-body problem – for which he found special solutions that suggested the existence of five equilibrium positions, now known as the LAGRANGIAN POINTS . Lagrangian points P oints in the orbital plane of two massive bodies at which a third body can remain in equilibrium, so that all three bodies remain in a fixed geometrical configuration. There are five such points, as shown in the diagram. The Lagrangian points L 4 and L 5 form equilateral triangles with M 1 and M 2 , and L 1 , L 2 and L 3 are collinear with M 1 and M 2 . Orbits close to L 4 and L 5 are stable and perform slow oscillations around the equilibrium points. The points L 1 , L 2 and L 3 are unstable, and any objects in these orbits would very slowly drift away (although some particular orbits in these vicinities are stable). The TROJAN ASTEROIDS are close to the L 4 and L 5 points of Jupiter’s orbit around the Sun, with oscillation amplitudes around the equilibrium points of up to 30º. Similar orbits occur in Saturn’s satellite system. The tiny satellites Telesto and Calypso are close to the L 4 and L 5 points of Tethys’ orbit around Saturn, and Helene is close to the L 4 point of Dione’s orbit. The spacecraft SOHO has been placed into a stable orbit close to the L 1 point of the Earth. This point is located between the Earth and the Sun at about 1,500,000 km (930,000 mi) from the Earth, which is about four times the distance of the Moon and one hundredth of the distance to the Sun. Lalande, (Joseph) Jérôme Le François (1732–1807) French astronomer, skilled mathematician and observer and popularizer of astronomy, who became director of P ARIS OBSERVATORY (1768). He compiled many accurate tables of planetary positions and a catalogue of over 47,000 stars. Lalande organized expeditions to observe the transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769, preparing detailed reports. He collaborated with Nicolas-Louis de LACAILLE in determining a highly improved value for the lunar parallax, Lalande observing from Berlin, Lacaille from South Africa.

He introduced the practice of naming lunar features after famous persons. La Palma Observatory See RO QU ED E LOS MUCHACHOS OBSERVATORY Laplace, Pierre-Simon de (1749–1827) French math- ematician who did much to establish celestial mechanics as a major scientific discipline; his Méchanique céleste is, after Isaac Newton’s PRINCIPIA , the most important work on the subject. His instructors at Caen University, where he matriculated at the age of sixteen, soon recognized his talents for complex mathematical methods, and three y ears later Laplace secured a position as professor of mathematics at the École Militaire. By 1771 he had pub- lished a fundamental study on the orbits and perturba- tions of the planets that was the cornerstone of his later studies of Solar System dynamics. This work was followed by a three-part study (1784–86) of the orbital mechanics of Jupiter and Saturn that utilized methods first developed by Joseph Louis de LAGRANGE to demonstrate that not only those two giant planets, but all the Solar System’s bodies, will tend to assume orbits of small eccentricity and small inclination ov er long time periods. This was the first major post- Newtonian work to show that the Solar System is stable under the precepts of Newtonian gravity. Many of these ideas were more fully explicated in his five-volume mas- terwork Tr aité de méchanique céleste (1799–1825). In Exposition du système du monde (1796) Laplace proposed his NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS . His studies of comets led him to issue a warning that comets could collide with the Earth, which would have catastrophic consequences for life on our planet.

The T ARANTULA NEBULA complex is found within the LMC and is one of the largest HII REGIONS known. The complex is a vigorous star-forming region, and this, together with other star- forming regions, may be the result of a close passage between the LMC and our Galaxy some 200 million y ears ago. There is also an enormous bridge of material between the Galaxy and the MAGELLANIC CLOUDS . Known as the Magellanic Stream, this bridge is one of the largest HIGH - VELOCITY CLOUDS known and probably resulted from the same close passage. The LMC orbits our Galaxy roughly at right angles to the plane of the Milky Way, and it may at some time in the future be disrupted and captured by our Galaxy. Y oung objects, such as hot stars and Cepheids, in the LMC lie in a thin disk, which is seen nearly face-on (an angle to the plane of the sky of about 27º). Older objects, such as planetary nebulae, form a somewhat thicker disk structure, but there is no evidence at present for a spheri- cal halo such as is formed by very old objects in our own Galaxy. In our Galaxy, GLOBULAR CLUSTERS are all old objects. However, the cluster NGC1866 in the LMC, though globular in form, is a young system. Several such ‘blue globulars’ exist in the clouds. No similar objects are known in our own Galaxy. large-scale structure Overall distribution of galaxy clusters and galaxies in the visible Universe. This distribution has been mapped in two wedges by astronomers up to a redshift of z = 0.04. A relevant cosmological model must explain the large-scale structure of matter in the Universe, essentially the distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters. This is usually done by comparing the CORRELATION FUNCTIONS derived from theoretical models utilizing COLD DARK MATTER or HOT DARK MATTER with the correlation function of the observed large-scale distribution of galaxies. There are several features of note in the observed distribution: V OIDS or regions generally devoid of galaxies; walls or linear distributions of galaxies and clusters; and SUPERCLUSTERS such as the Coma Cluster of galaxies. Larissa Second-largest (after PROTEUS ) of the inner satellites of NEPTUNE . Larissa was first detected in 1981 by Harold Reitsema and colleagues when it occulted a star; it was confirmed in 1989 in images returned by VOYA GER 2. Larissa is near-spherical in shape, measuring about 208 \u0001 178 km (129 \u0001 111 mi). It takes 0.555 days to circuit the planet, at a distance of 73,500 km (45,700 mi) from its centre, in a near- circular, near-equatorial orbit. Las Campanas Observatory Major optical observato- ry in the southern Atacama Desert 100 km (60 mi) north of La Serena, Chile, at an altitude of 2400 m (7900 ft). It was established by the CARNEGIE OBSERVA - T ORIES in 1969, and remains their primary observing site. The main instruments are the two 6.5-m (256-in) MAGELLAN TELESCOPES . The 2.5-m (98-in.) Irénée du P ont Telescope and the 1-m (39-in) Henrietta Swope T elescope, completed in 1977 and 1972 respectively, both have unusually wide fields of view. laser (acronym for ‘light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation’) Device that produces a beam of high-intensity, coherent (all waves in phase), monochromatic (all of one wavelength) ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION at infrared, optical or shorter wavelengths. A similar device at microwave frequencies is known as the MASER . The stimulated emission of a photon of particular wa v elength occurs when an electron in a high-energy level of an atom is induced to drop to a lower level by an encounter with a photon of energy exactly equal to the difference in energy between the upper and lower levels. The emitted photon has exactly the same wavelength and direction of propagation as the stimulating photon, and the emitted radiation is said to be coherent. In a laser, large numbers of electrons are pumped up into a higher energy level by means of a suitable energy source so that there are more electrons in the higher level than the lower level; this distribution of electrons is known as an ‘inverted population’. The electrons are then stimulated to emit a beam of coherent radiation. Laser action can be produced in solids, liquids or gases, and lasers may be pulsed or continuous in operation. Lasers are used in various astronomical contexts. For example, very precise measurements of the lunar dis- tance, and the Moon’s slow rate of recession, have been made by bouncing laser beams off reflectors placed on the lunar surface by the Apollo astronauts, and laser beams reflected from orbiting satellites allow the rate of continental drift to be measured. Lasers are also used to check and maintain the alignment of optical compo- nents, particularly in very large telescopes with segment- ed primary mirrors.

ESO’s smaller tele- scopes were the first on the site: the 1-m (39-in.) and the 1.5-m (59-in.) were both installed in the late 1960s. The 1.0-m (39-in.) Schmidt telescope began work in 1971 and was joined in 1976 by the 3.6-m (142-in.), the largest instrument at La Silla. The 1.4-m (55-in.) Coudé Auxiliary Telescope (CAT) was built to provide an alter- native feed to the 3.6-metre’s high-resolution spectro- g raph, while in 1984 the 2.2-m (87-in.) began operation. (The CAT and the Schmidt have since been decommis- sioned.) The NEW TECHNOLOGY TELESCOPE and SWEDISH ESO SUBMILLIMETRE TELESCOPE followed in the late 1980s. In addition to the ESO telescopes, La Silla hosts a number of national telescopes operated by ESO member states, the largest being the Geneva Observato- ry ’s 1.2-m (48-in.) telescope. Lassell, William (1799–1880) English ‘Grand Amateur’ astronomer. By the age of 25, he had founded the brewery that would finance his lifelong career in astronomical research. Lassell studied primarily the bodies of the outer Solar System. Following the announcement of the Berlin discovery of Neptune on 1846 September 30, he quickly located the new planet and on October 10 identified its large satellite, Triton; five y ears later he found Uranus’ satellites Ariel and Umbriel (1851). He also co-discovered (with G.P. and W.C. BOND at Harvard) Saturn’s Crepe (C) Ring and its satellite Hyperion (1848). Lassell’s enduring reputation comes from his transfor- mation of the big reflecting telescope from the timber and rope altazimuth constructions developed by William Her- schel to beautifully engineered iron equatorials with superlative optics. His 9-inch (230-mm) and 24-inch (0.6-m) Newtonians were the first sizeable instruments of their type to be mounted equatorially. With his engineer- astronomer friend James Nasmyth (1808–90), Lassell pioneered the prototype steam-powered polishing machine for making 48-inch (1.2-m) mirrors, and con- L Lassell, William 223 \u0001 Larissa During its 1989 August flyby, Voyager 2 imaged Neptune’s inner satellite Larissa.

Evidence for the bombardment is seen in the distribution of craters on Mercury, Mars and the Moon. Ages of lunar rocks indicate that the large mare BASINS w ere formed between about 4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago. Undoubtedly, the early Earth experienced impacts of comparable or larger magnitude, but much of the evidence has been erased by erosion and TECTONICS . It is not clear whether the bombardment was simply the final stage of a continuously declining flux of impacts at the end of A CCRETION of the planets, or whether it was a distinct ‘cataclysm’ with a temporary large increase in the impact rate. If the latter, the projectiles may have been asteroids perturbed from the MAIN BELT by Jupiter, or comets scattered from the outer Solar System due to the formation of Uranus and Neptune. late-type star Lower temperature star of spectral class K, M, R, N or S. The term was devised when astronomers erroneously believed that the sequence of SPECTRAL TYPES w as also an evolutionary sequence. The usage persists, ‘late’ being a common astronomical synonym for ‘cool’ (for example, a G5 star is ‘later’ than a G0 star). latitude Angular measure from an equatorial great circle or plane in a spherical coordinate system. On the surface of the Earth, latitude is measured in degrees north or south of the equator, reaching a maximum at the poles. Celestial latitude (or ecliptic latitude) is the angular distance north or south of the ecliptic to the ecliptic poles. Galactic latitude is a measure of angular distance from the galactic equator to the galactic poles. Heliocentric latitude is the same as celestial latitude, but corrected for a hypothetical observer located at the centre of the Sun, while heliographic latitude is measured on the Sun’s disk, north or south of its equator.

The braking action of the tides causes the Earth’s peri- od of rotation to slow by between 1.5 and 2.0 milliseconds per day per century. In order that time as kept by atomic clocks (UTC) and that derived from observations of the stars (UT1, see UNIVERSAL TIME ) do not differ by more than 0.9 seconds, an extra second is introduced to UTC at midnight on either December 31 or June 30 as required. This has the effect of producing an accumulated dif- ference between UTC and INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC TIME (TAI) of an integral number of seconds. The most recent leap seconds were inserted as follows: Date TAI–UTC 1989 December 31 \u0001 25.0 sec 1990 December 31 \u0001 26.0 sec 1992 June 30 \u0001 27.0 sec 1993 June 30 \u0001 28.0 sec 1994 June 30 \u0001 29.0 sec 1995 December 31 \u0001 30.0 sec 1997 June 30 \u0001 31.0 sec 1998 December 31 \u0001 32.0 sec leap year Y ear containing 366 instead of the usual 365 days. The CALENDAR is based on a solar year of 365.25 days but fixed at 365. An extra day is therefore added at the end of February every fourth year to compensate. However, this still only approximates to the true solar y ear of 365.24219 days and so century years (1800, 1900, and so on) are not leap years unless exactly divisible by 400 (1600, 2000, and so on). Leavitt, Henrietta Swan (1868–1921) American astronomer who discovered 2400 variable stars, and whose studies of Cepheid variables in the Small Magellan- ic Cloud led to the discovery of the period–luminosity relationship used to measure cosmic distances. Edward C. PICKERING hired Leavitt, who was deaf, to work at Har- v ard College Observatory, originally as an unpaid volun- teer, on the tedious task of measuring the brightness of star images on Harvard’s massive collection of photo- g raphic plates. In 1902 Leavitt’s work was recognized when she was appointed head of Harvard’s Department of Photographic Photometry. She began to specialize in variable stars (in all she would discover 2400 – half the total known in her lifetime), study- ing images of CEPHEID VARIABLES on plates taken at Har- v ard’s southern station at Arequipa, Peru. While analysing images of stars in the Magellanic Clouds, Leavitt noticed that the periods of stars that appeared to be Cepheids depended on their apparent magnitudes – the more lumi- nous they were, the longer their periods. In her 1912 paper summarizing this work, she gave the periods for 25 Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud. By 1918 Ejnar HERTZSPRUNG and Harlow SHAPLEY had recast the PERI - OD – LUMINOSITY LAW in terms of absolute, rather than apparent, magnitudes, which allowed Leavitt’s Cepheid va r iables to be used as reliable yardsticks for measuring distances within the Milky Way galaxy and, once they had been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy, beyond. Leavitt’s other studies included preparatory work on the NORTH POLAR SEQUENCE , a standard reference for photographic magnitudes she helped to establish by com- paring nearly three hundred plates of the region around the north celestial pole taken through different telescopes.

See also ELARA Lemaître, Georges Édouard (1894–1966) Belgian Catholic priest and cosmologist whose theory of the ‘primeval atom’ foreshadowed the Big Bang theory. He began his work on the expansion of the Universe during a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard (1924–25). Lemaître heard that Edwin HUBBLE had used CEPHEID VARIABLES in the Andromeda Galaxy to determine that it lay far beyond the Milky Way, and was aware of Vesto M. SLIPHER ’s earlier finding that the radial velocities of galax- ies showed a redshift in their spectra. He realized that galaxies must be speeding away from one another. Inde- pendent of similar ideas proposed by Aleksandr FRIED - MANN (which were not well known outside Russia), he considered how this expansion would vary with time according to GENERAL RELATIVITY , taking into account the effect of the pressure of matter, and assuming a non- zero value of the COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT . This LEMAÎTRE UNIVERSE , as it became known, was the first to a ttempt to reconcile a cosmological model with the observed expansion of the Universe. Lemaître became professor of astronomy at Louvain in 1927. That year he published a paper stating that the more distant a receding galaxy, the greater its velocity of recession – a concept not explained by Friedmann. Arthur EDDING - TON publicized Lemaître’s results at the 1927 meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society. In 1931 Lemaître pro- posed that the Universe was born from a ‘primeval atom’ that disintegrated over time to produce gaseous clouds, stars and cosmic rays, an idea we now know to be incorrect.

Le Monnier, Pierre Charles (1715–99) French astronomer and physicist whose scientific career spanned many different disciplines. In celestial mechanics, he analysed the perturbing effect of Saturn on Jupiter’s orbit and devised a theory to explain the Moon’s complex motions. His contributions to celestial cartography included the measurement of many star positions and compilation of the Atlas céleste . Le Monnier observed Uranus before it was seen by its discoverer, William Herschel, but failed to recognize it as a planet. lens Basic optical component made of transparent material through which light passes in order to produce or modify an image. Astronomical lenses range in size and complexity from tiny spherical sapphire lenses a ttached to the ends of fibre optics, through to large OBJECTIVE lenses used to collect and focus light in refracting telescopes. Lenses are also used to shape and direct light as it passes through astronomical instruments for analysis and measurement, but the most common example as far as the amateur astronomer is concerned is the telescope EYEPIECE . There are two basic types of lens, converging and diverging. Converging lenses are thicker in the centre than at the edges and cause parallel light passing through them to bend towards a common point, that is, to converge. The simplest example of a converging lens is the magnify- ing lens. Diverging lenses cause parallel light to spread out and to appear to come from a common point behind the lens, that is, to diverge. Diverging lenses are thicker at the edges than at the centre and the most common example is the spectacle lens used to correct short-sightedness. Converging lenses often have two convex surfaces and so are sometimes called convex lenses. Diverging lenses often have two concave surfaces and so are called con- cave lenses. However, both types can have one convex surface and one concave so this terminology can be slightly misleading. A lens can produce a focused image because light is bent (refracted) as it passes from air to glass and then from glass back to air. It is the shape of the air–glass sur- face that determines how the light is bent and what effect this has on the image produced. Surfaces are usually spherical, although more complex shapes are used to reduce optical aberrations. Several manufacturers now advertise binoculars with aspheric optics which offer superior performance. Single lenses produce ABERRATIONS in the images they produce. This is inevitable even with lenses that are per- fectly shaped. It is caused by fundamental geometric effects and the fact that the different wavelengths of light (the different colours) are bent by different amounts as they pass through a lens. Optical designers use multi-ele- ment lenses and materials with different properties to minimize aberrations. Even a simple telescope eyepiece will contain two, three or four separate pieces of glass; complex ones can contain seven, eight or more.

Lenticular galaxies are of a type intermediate in form between the much more common elliptical and spiral types.

Lenticular galaxies contain both central b ulges and surrounding disks of stars, and the disks include significant amounts of dust in some cases. Leo See feature article Leo Minor See feature article Leonids Interesting METEOR SHOWER , active between November 15–20 and usually peaking around November 17. The RADIANT lies within the ‘sickle’ of Leo. The shower produces reasonable activity each year, with peak ZENITHAL HOURLY RATE (ZHR) about 15. It a ttracts most attention, however, in the ten-year span centred on the perihelion return of the parent comet, 55P/ TEMPEL – TUTTLE , during which time rates are g reatly elevated, perhaps reaching meteor storm proportions on some occasions. Past Leonid storms have been separated by roughly 33-year intervals: those on 1799 November 12 and 1833 November 12 did much to stimulate scientific interest in the study of meteors. The later time of maximum at the modern epoch results from regression of the meteor stream orbit’s descending node. F ollowing the 1833 return, Hubert Newton (1830–96) of Princeton, United States, investigated the origin of the Leonids. He found historical records of the shower going back to AD 902, including exceptional dis- plays in 934, 1002, 1101, 1202, 1366, 1533, 1602 and 1698. Newton surmised that these were caused by a dense cloud of meteoroids encountered by Earth at inter- v als of about 33 years; he made the bold prediction, con- firmed by Heinrich OLBERS , that another storm might occur in 1866. This prediction was duly borne out on L Leonids 225 LEO MINOR ( GEN . LEO MINORIS , ABBR .

Subsequent gravitational perturbations by Jupiter and Uranus pulled the densest parts of the Leonid stream away from close encounter with Earth, and the much-anticipat- ed 1899 return proved a relative disappointment: while rates were again enhanced (200–300/hr), the shower did not produce a storm. Comparatively modest returns also followed in 1932 and 1933. The strongest historical dis- plays had usually been seen when the comet/stream orbit’s node lay inside Earth’s orbit, and Earth arrived there with- in 2500 days of the comet. Further gravitational perturba- tions restored such conditions in time for the 1966 return, when estimated Leonid rates of 140,000/hr were seen in a 40-minute interval by observers in the western United States on the morning of November 17. The Leonids were again the subject of much study around the 1998 perihelion of 55P/Tempel–Tuttle. Activi- ty began to increase markedly in 1994, and many attempts w ere made to forecast when any storm might occur at this return. No storm was seen in 1998, when Earth followed the comet to the node by 258 days. Instead, to the great surprise of all, an outburst comprising mainly bright Leonids occurred some 16 hours ahead of node-passage, with ZHR around 250 for some 10–12 hours. The 1999 shower, however, did produce storm activity, albeit at lower levels than many of the great events of the past: around node-passage on November 18 d 02 h UT, ZHR reached about 3000, with activity on this occasion consist- ing mostly of faint Leonids. P erhaps the most successful forecasts of Leonid activi- ty close to the comet’s 1998 perihelion have been those of Robert McNaught (1956– ) of the Anglo-Australian Observatory and D.J. Asher of Armagh Observatory, Northern Ireland. They based their stream model on dis- crete filaments or arcs of debris that remained close to the nucleus following their release at separate perihelion returns of 55P/Tempel–Tuttle. Using this model McNaught and Asher have been able to predict, with rea- sonable accuracy, the times of several peaks during the 1999 and 2000 displays. More importantly, they were successful in forecasting substantial peaks around 10 h and 19 h UT on 2001 November 18, each of which produced activity similar to that in 1999. The strong activity in 2001 persisted for several hours centred on these maxima, unlike the short-lived, sharp peak two years earlier. In the longer term, forecasts for the Leonids’ next round of elevated returns around 2032 are not particular- ly favourable, as their orbit is once again pulled away from Earth. Expectations are that the most active displays at that time may be about double those seen in most years from the PERSEIDS .

Lepus See feature article Le Verrier, Urbain Jean Joseph (1811–77) French mathematician who specialized in celestial mechanics, predicting the existence of Neptune from the perturbations of Uranus. Trained as an experimental chemist, he shifted his research interests to astronomy after accepting a post at the École Polytechnique in 1837. As director of Paris Observatory (1854) he introduced major reforms; he was dismissed from office in 1870 but reinstated after the death of his successor, Charles DELAUNAY , in 1872. Le Verrier analysed the stability of orbits of planets and minor bodies of the Solar System, including periodic comets. He investigated the advance in the perihelion of Mercury, which he attributed to a hypothetical planet pre- maturely named VULCAN . But it was his careful analysis – independently of John Couch ADAMS – of discrepancies between predicted and observed positions of Uranus that brought Le Verrier his greatest fame. He was able to com- pute the position of a hitherto undiscovered planet orbit- ing beyond Uranus that explained the irregularities in terms of gravitational perturbations by the new body.

He was the first to prove the planetary nature of Uranus (it was originally suspected to be a comet). Lexell, Comet (D/1770 L1) First short-period comet on record. Discovered by Charles MESSIER , it is one of the best-known cases of a cometary orbit having been altered considerably after being perturbed by the gr a vitational pull of the massive planet Jupiter. In 1770 this comet, in its approach towards perihelion, passed between the satellites of Jupiter. Later, on 1770 July 1, it came within 2.5 million km (1.6 million mi) of the Earth. As it passed by, the transient gravitational grasp of the Earth caused a decrease in the comet’s period by almost three days, but the change in the period of the far more massive Earth was so small as to be immeasurable. The orbit of the comet was investigated by Anders LEXELL , who found it to have a period of 5.6 years. He showed that the comet had been highly perturbed by Jupiter in 1767 May, when its orbit had been changed from a much larger ellipse to its present shape, which explained why it had never been seen previously. The comet was never seen again after 1770. The reason for this was provided by Pierre LAPLACE , who showed that a second close approach to Jupiter had occurred in 1779. On this occasion it had passed so close to Jupiter that its orbit was altered dramatically, with large changes in its orbital period and perihelion distance. Libra See feature article libration Small oscillation of a celestial body about its mean position. The term is used most frequently to mean the Moon’s libration. As a result of libration it is possible to see, at different times, 59% of the Moon’s surface. However, the areas that pass into and out of view are close to the LIMB and therefore extremely foreshortened, so in practice libration has less of an effect on the features that can be clearly made out on the Moon’s disk than this figure might suggest. Physical libration results from slight irregularities in the Moon’s motion produced by irregularities in its shape. Much more obvious is geometrical libration , which results from the Earth-based observer seeing the Moon from different directions at different times. There are three types of geometrical libration. Libration in lon- g itude arises from a combination of the Moon’s SYN - CHRONOUS ROTATION and its elliptical orbit. As a result, at times a little more of the lunar surface is visible at the eastern or western limb than when the Moon is at its mean position. Libration in latitude arises because the Moon’s equator is tilted slightly from its orbital plane, so that the two poles tilt alternately towards and away from the Earth. A smaller effect is diurnal libration, by which the Earth’s rotation allows us to see more of the Moon’s surface at its western limb when it is rising, and more at the eastern limb when it is setting. Lick Observatory Major optical observatory, and the first in the United States to be built on a mountain-top site. Its telescopes are on Mount Hamilton, about 32 km (20 mi) east of San Jose, California, at an altitude of 1280 m (4200 ft). Its first director was Edward S. HOLD - EN . The observatory was the result of a bequest to the University of California by an eccentric millionaire, James Lick (1796–1876), whose body lies beneath the pier of the 0.9-m (36-in.) Lick Refractor. Inaugurated in 1888, the telescope was for nine years the largest in the world, and it remains the world’s second-largest refractor. With it, Edward E. BARNARD discovered Amalthea in 1892, the first Jovian satellite to be found since 1610. The front ele- ment of its objective lens was refigured in 1987, having suffered long-term damage from atmospheric corrosion. Several other telescopes are on Mount Hamilton, including the Crossley 0.9-m (36-in.) reflector, once o wned by Andrew COMMON , and the 1-m (39-in.) Nickel Reflector, built in 1983. The largest telescope at Lick is the C. Donald Shane Telescope 3.05-m (120-in.), com- pleted in 1959 and named after a former director. Lick Observatory is still operated by the University of Califor- nia Observatories, with headquarters in Santa Cruz. life in the Universe The study of the possible existence of life in the Universe beyond the Earth is variously termed bioastronomy , astrobiology and exobiology . It covers questions on the existence of life on other planetary bodies in the Solar System, such as Mars and Europa; the study of organic molecules in giant molecular clouds and circumstellar material ( see INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES ) and in comets and meteorites; the study of planetary sur- faces and atmospheres; questions of the origins of life, whether on the Earth or elsewhere ( see also PANS PERMIA ), and the range of conditions under which it can survive; and the search for life in space, by ‘listening’ for intelligent signals ( see SETI ) and investigating extrasolar planets. The first truly scientific ideas (as opposed to philo- sophical speculation on the ‘plurality of worlds’) on the possibility of extraterrestrial life followed the invention of the telescope. Early ideas were entirely anthropocentric and shaped largely by contemporary religious beliefs. In the late 18th century Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) for- malized these ideas, proposing that all planets would have their own appropriate inhabitants matched to the conditions that prevailed upon them. There were sug- gestions that the Moon, with its ‘terrae’ and ‘maria’, and even the Sun, were inhabited. With improvements in telescope design during the 19th century, Mars became a focus of attention. The planet was soon being described as a world of reddish ‘continents’, dark ‘seas’ and white icy polar caps that grew and shrank with the passing of the Martian seasons. Some concluded that Mars might support life or even be inhabited. Schiapar- elli’s identification of dark linear streaks – canali – on the Martian surface sparked a major debate on whether these features were natural or artificial ( see CANALS , MAR - TIAN ). By the mid-20th century new instruments and techniques had revealed Mars as a world incapable of supporting any form of reasonably advanced terrestrial L life in the Universe 227 \u0001 libration Although the Moon is in synchronous r otation with respect to the Earth, ground-based observers can still, over the course of several lunations, see significantly more than just half of its surface.

However, a small number of scientists continued to hope that relative simple forms of primitive life such as lichens might be found there. That hope died in 1964, when the first successful flyby of Mars, by the Mariner 4 spacecraft, revealed a cold, arid Moon-like surface show- ing no visible evidence of life. To search for extraterrestrial life, astronomers must first decide exactly what to look for. Only carbon seems able to build the backbones of the complicated molecules required for life. (Although silicon can form long-chain molecules, its ability to do so is limited and there is no evi- dence that silicon-based life is possible.) In addition to carbon there are just five other elements that are found in all metabolizing living organisms, hydrogen, nitrogen, o xygen, phosphorus and sulphur – CHNOPS for short. Other elements – sodium, magnesium, chlorine, potassi- um, calcium, iron, manganese, copper and iodine – are regularly but not always found in living cells. Altogether, two-thirds of the 92 naturally occurring elements are found in various living organisms, but never all together in the same one. Clearly, living material is distinguished from the inanimate not by its constituent atoms, but by its com- plex organized structure and active metabolism. As the CHNOPS elements are among the commonest and most abundant in the Universe, it is probably safe to assume that life, wherever it exists, is based on these same elements. Life can be broadly defined as a chemical process, seemingly unique to carbon, that draws energy from its local environment to generate and maintain struc- tural complexity. In so doing it reduces local entropy, thus increasing the total entropy of the surrounding Universe. The search for life is therefore a search for evidence of departures from thermodynamic and chemical equilibri- um that are associated with biological activity. Until recently, the list of Solar System objects consid- ered worth searching for evidence of life automatically excluded worlds devoid of an atmosphere, and those out- side the Sun’s ECOSPHERE (or habitable zone), whose lim- its correspond quite closely to the orbits of Venus and Mars. Although Venus has a dense atmosphere, space probes have revealed it to be hostile to life in every way. Mars, at the outer limit of the Sun’s ecosphere, appears to be a possible if uncertain abode of life. The surface chem- istry of Mars at two different sites was investigated in 1976 by the sophisticated landers of the two VIKING mis- sions. They revealed no unequivocal evidence for the exis- tence of Martian life. It was concluded that, at the present epoch at least, Mars is devoid of life, implying that any extraterrestrial life would have to be sought beyond the Solar System ( see EXTRASOLAR PLANET ). Interest in searching for life within the Solar System has been revitalized by a succession of major discoveries about the extreme limits of life on Earth. It was formerly assumed that the region extending several kilometres below the Earth’s surface was essentially sterile. In the late 1970s, the first hot hydrothermal plumes and ‘black smokers’ – hydrothermal outflows rich in heavy metal sulphides – were discovered rising from the slopes of seafloor ridges 2–3 km (1.25–2 mi) down. Several hun- dred smokers are now known, they have temperatures of as much as 620 K (at this depth, water boils at ~670 K). The regions surrounding these vents harbour one of the most extraordinary ecosystems on Earth. Under enor- mous pressure, in complete darkness without energy from the Sun, are microorganisms that feed on the chem- icals that rise from deep inside the Earth, many living at temperatures of ~380 K. In 1993 new species of microorganisms were collected from rocks 2.7 km (1.7 mi) below ground – anaerobic organisms that die when exposed to oxygen, having little resemblance to the typical microbes found on the surface, thriving at an ambient temperature of ~350 K. (Similar thermophilic microbes colonize volcanically heated gey- sers and springs, such as those in Yellowstone National P ark, and hydrothermal plumes on the ocean floor.) Pre- sent evidence indicates that subsurface life may extend to ~4 km (2.5 mi) below the continental crust and ~7 km (4.5 mi) below the oceanic crust. An entirely new library of names has entered biology for microorganisms that occupy a new branch of the tree of life – the Archaea. This branch includes microbes that thrive at very high temperatures – thermophiles and h yperthermophiles , at very high pressures – baryophiles , and in hyper-saline environments – halophiles ; organisms that metabolize methane or sulphur compounds – methanogens and thiophiles : microbes that thrive at very low temperatures – cryophiles ; organ- isms that live within rocks – lithophiles ; and even organ- isms that live in the most acid and alkaline environments that would rapidly dissolve and destroy most other life forms. Other microorganisms show extremely high levels of tolerance to intense UV and nuclear radiation, some can resist almost total dehydration, and some can survive being in a vacuum for biologically long periods of time. (Interest- ingly, hyper-thermophiles may be the oldest surviving form of terrestrial life, and clearly would have been well adapted to the conditions that prevailed more than 4 billion y ears ago, shortly after the Earth formed.) Microorgan- isms living in extreme environments are collectively referred to as extremophiles . The discovery that terrestrial life seems to have filled every possible environmental niche, above and below the surface, suggests that subsurface life may exist on other planetary bodies in the Solar System, even if their surfaces are totally inhospitable. The essential requirement is that wa ter is present and that the internal heat flow and pres- sure allow liquid water to exist at some depth, forming a subsurface ecozone . Subsurface conditions suitable for some form of extremophile life range from small circum- polar regions on MERCURY – (if water/ice is present there) to the distance of Pluto. Pluto and its satellite Charon are locked by spin-orbit coupling, and solar tides squeezing Charon could be maintaining a subsurface layer of liquid wa ter, providing a suitable environment for cryophiles. This range extends far beyond the limits of the conven- tionally defined ecosphere. F or the foreseeable future, only targets in the Solar System will be accessible for close observation from orbit or direct investigation of their surfaces, though the search for extrasolar planets may reveal some clues. The four planetary size satellites of Jupiter and Saturn’s large moon Titan are major candidates in the search for life. Titan’s thick atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, with measurable quantities of methane and ethane, and there is potential for some form of cryophilic microbial life there. Results from the Galileo mission to Jupiter show that Europa and Ganymede, and possibly Callisto, possess subsurface oceans. Both Europa and Ganymede possess internal heat sources, in part derived from tidal heating, and are strong candidates for the existence of some form of wide- spread or localized submarine hydrothermal vent activity – perhaps capable of supporting chemosynthetic ecosys- tems ( see also EUROPA ORBITER ). The search for traces of past or extant microbial life on Mars is already under wa y, and the question whether surface or subsurface life once existed or still exists there may be answered in the first half of the 21st century. Subsurface environments conducive to chemosyn- thetic microbial life cannot be limited to the Solar Sys- L light, velocity of 228 \u0001 life in the Universe An artist’s impression of the Darwin spacecraft, which will be used for observations of planets around other stars.

The most widespread and abundant forms of life in the Universe will most likely have more in com- mon with microorganisms than with the complex multi- cellular organisms that characterize the life on the Earth’s surface. light, velocity of The value for the velocity of light (and of all other forms of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION ) in a v acuum, usually symbolized as ‘ c ’, was officially recognised as 299,792,458 m/s by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1976. For many purposes, however, the approximate value of 300,000 km/s (3 \u0001 10 8 m/s) is sufficient. One of the first attempts to measure the velocity of light was made by GALILEO in 1600, prior to that, most scientists had expected its velocity to be infinite. Galileo and an assistant stood about a kilometre apart with lanterns. When the assistant saw a flash from Galileo’s lantern, he briefly opened the cover on his own. Galileo then attempted to measure the time lag between uncover- ing his own lantern and seeing the flash from the other lantern. Needless to say, the experiment failed since the reaction times involved were ten thousand times longer than the light flight times. The first reasonably successful determination of c w as made be Ole RÖMER in 1676. He had been observing and timing transits and occultations of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites, when he noticed that the events were occurring later than he had predicted on the basis of earlier observations. Römer realised that this was because the Earth and Jupiter had moved around their orbits and were further apart than when he had made the previous observations. The delays in the occurrence of the satellite phenomena therefore arose because of the time it took light to cross the increased distance between the planets. From his measurements, Römer determined a v elocity of 240,000 km/s for light. Hippolyte FIZEAU made the first ‘laboratory’ determi- nation of c in 1849. He shone light on to a mirror placed nearly 9 km (6 mi) away and looked at the reflection. Both the outgoing and returning beams passed between the teeth of a rotating gearwheel. At slow rotations, the returning beam would pass through the same gap between the teeth of the gearwheel as the outgoing beam, and so could be seen. When the speed of rotation was increased, there would come a point where the returned beam was intercepted by the next tooth, and so could not be seen. Increasing the speed still further enabled the returning beam to be seen again as it passed through the gap next to the one used by the outgoing beam. The number of teeth on the gearwheel (720) and its rotation- al velocity (1500 rpm) when the returning beam was seen for the second time, provided Fizeau with the time taken by light for the return journey, and from this he found a velocity for light of 315,000 km/s. As his apparatus was refined, Fizeau was able to show that light passing through moving water had a higher v elocity when it went with the flow rather than against it, and in 1853 Leon FOUCAULT showed that the velocity was lower in water than in air. Experiments like these led to the expectation that the velocity of light would vary depending on whether a light beam was travelling in the same direction through space as the Earth, or in the opposite direction. So in 1887 the German-American physicist Albert Michelson (1852–1931) and the Ameri- can chemist Edward Morley (1838–1923) conducted their famous experiment ( see MICHELSON – MORLEY EXPERIMENT ). Their failure to detect the Earth’s motion by finding a changing velocity for light led directly to the idea that the velocity of light was constant for all observers, whatever their motion, and so to EINSTEIN ’ S theory of SPECIAL RELATIVITY . Michelson later (1926) determined a value of 299,796 km/s for the velocity of light, using a variation of Fizeau’s method, with the light beam reflected out to and back from a mirror 35 km (22 mi) away via a rotating octagonal prism. F or astronomers, a consequence of the finite velocity of light is that objects are seen as they were when they emitted the light that is now received, not as they may be today. An object one light-year away is seen as it was a y ear ago and so on. For more distant objects, this ‘look back’ time, can be very large, as much as 10 10 y ears or so for the most distant quasars. Some objects may thus have changed radically or even no longer exist, though they can still be seen in the sky. Thus the 1987 SUPERNOVA in the Large Magellanic Cloud could still be seen as a star 170,000 years after it had actually exploded. light, visible ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION ,w ith wa v elengths from about 380 to 700 nm, that may be seen by the human eye. The nature of light is now thought to be fairly well understood, yet it was the subject of controversy for more than 200 years, as experimenters uncovered con- flicting evidence of its nature. Some evidence suggested that light was composed of individual particles, other evidence suggested that it was composed of waves. It was even found necessary to invent a substance to carry these waves, the so-called luminiferous ether, which is now known not to exist. Not until the pioneering experi- ments of the Scottish physicist Thomas Young (1773–1829) was the wave-like nature of light firmly established for the scientific community. EINSTEIN ,how- ever, in his 1905 explanation of the photoelectric effect then showed that light also behaved as though it were a stream of particles. It is now known that light is both particle and wave. That is, that light comes in small packets, called PHOTONS . This is true whether light, radio waves or X-rays are con- sidered (all of which are types of electromagnetic radia- tion). This packet is composed of an electric field and a magnetic field, each of which ‘oscillates’ at right angles to its direction of motion. The interaction of these fields was first described in mathematical form by James Clark MAXWELL . His laws are now known to all students of physics as ‘Maxwell’s laws’ and are the basis of the study of electromagnetism, the study of all phenomena related to the interactions of electric and magnetic fields. Despite the opening-up of other regions of the ELEC - TROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM in recent years, our picture of the Universe is still largely based on what we actually see, that is, the information brought to us by light. light cone In a spacetime diagram, line or curve that represents the path of a light ray.

For professional astronomers its effects can so impede or distort scientific observations as to result in the eventual closure of observatories enveloped by urban sprawl in the years since their foundation. light-time (look back time) Time taken for light to travel between the object and the observer. When making accurately timed measurements of, for example, va r iable stars, the varying time taken for light to reach the Earth at different points in its orbit must be taken into account.

The inner Lindblad resonance occurs where the stars are moving faster than the spiral pattern, and the outer Lindblad resonance occurs where they are moving slower. For our GALAXY , these resonances occur at about 12,000 l.y. and 50,000 l.y. from the centre of the Galaxy respectively.

LINEAR, Comets Comets discovered by the MIT Lincoln Laboratory Near Earth Asteroid Research Project (LINEAR). Established in 1998 March, LINEAR employs two 1-m (0.39-in.) telescopes sited at White Sands, New Mexico, USA, to search for potentially hazardous minor planets. The patrol, using wide-field CCD cameras, has been very successful and has also led to the discovery of several comets: as of late 2001 the comet discovery total stood at over 60. Among the most notable of these comets was C/1999 S4 (LINEAR), discovered on 1999 September 27. Orbital calculations suggested that this comet would become a reasonably bright object around perihelion, 0.77 AU from the Sun, on 2000 July 26. The comet showed unusual activity in early July, shedding at least one fragment from its nucleus. Following a slight brightening around July 20–21, the comet broke into a cloud of small- er fragments, and, as the released gas and dust dispersed, it faded rapidly from view. Among other LINEAR discov- eries, C/2001 A2 became a bright binocular object prone to outbursts in June and July of 2001, and 2000 WM1 became bright in late December 2001. line of nodes Line of intersection of the orbit plane of a body with the reference plane used for the orbit.

Lithium has five ISOTOPES , two of which are stable and form the naturally occurring element (lithium-6, 7.4%, and lithium-7, 92.6%). The abundance of lithium is far higher in the interstel- lar medium than it is in stars. This is because lithium is produced in the interstellar medium by cosmic ray impacts with carbon, oxygen and other nuclei. It is quick- ly destroyed in stars because it undergoes nuclear reac- tions at temperatures as low as 500,000 K. Lithium thus acts as an important initiator in PROTOSTARS to start the h ydrogen-burning reactions.

The zero point for the local standard of rest is an imaginary point in the galactic plane moving clockwise in a circular orbit around the galactic centre at a velocity of about 220 km/s (140 mi/s) with a period equal to that of the Sun. Astronomers measure a star’s velocity components with respect to the LSR rather than to the Sun, because the Sun’s orbit around the galaxy is slightly non-circular. local supercluster Group of galactic clusters that contains our LOCAL GROUP of galaxies and several other clusters.

From 1864 Lockyer began to study the Sun almost exclusively after hearing of Gustav KIRCH - HOFF ’s discovery in 1859 that the solar spectrum con- tained lines indicating the presence of sodium atoms. After discussions with William HUGGINS , Lockyer a ttached a small dispersion spectroscope to his own tele- scope in the hope of making similar discoveries. In 1868 he found, independently of Jules JANSSEN , that solar prominences produced bright, yellow emission lines. One of these lines did not appear in any laboratory spectrum produced by a known terrestrial chemical ele- ment, so Lockyer suspected that it was produced by a ‘new’ element, which he named ‘helium’, after the Greek w ord for ‘Sun’. It was not until 1895 that William Ram- say (1852–1916) managed to isolate helium from a ter- restrial source. This discovery proved the worth of astronomical spectroscopy. In 1869 Lockyer founded the scientific journal Nature , which he edited for 50 years. Combining astron- omy and archaeology, he was able accurately to date the megalithic Stonehenge monuments by reckoning the changing position of the summer solstice sunrise since the monuments were built. In 1890 he established the Solar Physics Laboratory at South Kensington, serving as its director until 1911. He spent the rest of his scientif- ic life at his Hill Observatory at Sidmouth, Devon, now known as the Norman Lockyer Observatory. Loki Active volcano on Jupiter’s satellite IO . It was discovered on VOYA GER 1 images in 1979. Since then, continuing eruptions have been documented by infrared telescopic observations from Earth and by the GALILEO spacecraft orbiting JUPITER . Loki is the most persistently strong thermal source on Io. It is, on average, the site of about 25% of Io’s global heat output. Most of the thermal radiance comes from a probable crusted lake of molten lava, to the north of which is a fissure where plumes of sulphur dioxide are propelled up to hundreds of kilometres skywards. Lomonosov, Mikhail Vasilievich (1711–65) First Russian scientist to make notable contributions to astronomy. By 1745 he was a full member of St P etersburg’s Imperial Academy of Sciences, and was later appointed Professor of Chemistry at the university there. He conceived early versions of the wave theory of light and of the law of conservation of matter. L LMC 232 Galaxy Apparent Absolute Distance (thousand l.y.) mag. mag.

Lovell, (Alfred Charles) Bernard (1913– ) British radio astronomer responsible for building the radio tele- scope at Jodrell Bank, near Manchester. Early in his career, Lovell studied cosmic rays; after World War II he b uilt on his wartime radar research by using a 4.2-m (14-ft) radar telescope to study the ionized radio echoes produced by meteors. In 1950 he offered the first defini- tive explanation for the phenomenon of SCINTILLATION produced by Earth’s ionosphere, which can propagate and amplify incoming or distant radio waves. This phe- nomenon, also known as SCATTERING , is useful for study- ing the solar wind and for measuring the angular sizes of extraterrestrial radio sources. Lovell built a 66.5-m (218- ft) wire bowl-shaped transit radio telescope that was used by Robert Hanbury BROWN and others to detect the first radio waves from the Andromeda Galaxy. In 1951 Lovell was appointed professor of radio astronomy at Manchester University, and six years later his dream of a radio-astronomy observatory was realized when Jodrell Bank, now the NUFFIELD RADIO ASTRONOMY LABORATORY , was opened.

Lovell Telescope See JODRELL BANK OBSERVATORY Lowell, Percival (1855–1916) Wealthy American diplo- mat and amateur astronomer from a distinguished family; he built the LOWELL OBSERVATORY and became famous for his observations of Mars and his theory that the plan- et was inhabited by intelligent beings. Lowell graduated from Harvard in 1876 with a distinction in mathematics. During the 1880s and 1890s, he spent time on diplomat- ic missions to Japan and Korea. Around 1890 he became enthused by the Mars observations of Giovanni SCHIA - P ARELLI and the theories that the planet might be inhabit- ed by sentient life forms made popular by Camille FLAMMARION and others. Four years later, largely to determine whether these theories were true, Lowell built a private observatory at Flagstaff, Arizona, just in time for the 1894 opposition of Mars. Fo r the next two decades, Lowell used his observato- ry ’s refractors (the largest a 24-inch (600-mm) complet- ed by ALVAN CLARK & SONS in 1896) to study Mars closely. He concluded that the network of straight, dark lines that Schiaparelli had called canali w as a global irri- gation system, constructed by intelligent beings deter- mined to save their planet from drought by transporting wa ter from the planet’s polar icecaps to its arid temper- a te and equatorial regions. He set out his theories in three popular books – Mars (1895), Mars and its Canals (1906) and Mars as the Abode of Life (1908) – and pro- duced intricate maps of the canal network. Today, the Martian CANALS are regarded as a mere optical illusion and historical curiosity. Although he was criticized for his bold, even unscien- tific approach to the question of life on Mars, Lowell left a rich astronomical heritage through his observatory. During the last eight years of his life he initiated a search for a trans-Neptunian planet that led to Clyde T OMBAUGH ’s discovery of Pluto in 1930. It was Lowell who in 1914 urged Vesto M. SLIPHER to make the obser- va tions that led to the discovery of galaxy REDSHIFTS two y ears later. Lowell Observatory Observatory founded in 1894 by P ercival LOWELL at Flagstaff, Arizona, at an altitude of 2200 m (7300 ft). It is managed by a sole trustee who is a Lowell descendant, while an internal advisory board and director supervise day-to-day operations. It is famous for Lowell’s investigations of Mars, Vesto M. SLIPHER ’s dis- covery of galaxy redshifts, and Clyde T OMBAUGH ’s discov- ery of Pluto. The observatory’s first major telescope was a 0.6-m (24-in.) refractor built in 1896. A second site at Anderson Mesa, south-east of Flagstaff, hosts the Ohio W esleyan University’s 1.83-m (72-in.) reflector, operated jointly with Ohio State University. lower culmination Pa ssage of a CIRCUMPOLAR STAR across the meridian between the pole and the horizon. At this point the star’s HOUR ANGLE is exactly 12 h . Circumpolar stars do not set below the observer’s horizon and therefore cross the meridian twice during each SIDEREAL DAY , once at lower CULMINATION and once at UPPER CULMINATION , between the pole and the ZENITH . low-surface-brightness galaxy GALAXY whose surface brightness falls well below those of the familiar luminous spirals and elliptical galaxies, either because it contains very few stars or because its stars are spread over an unusually large area. Such galaxies range from dwarfs to very luminous systems, and may be quite gas-rich. The type example, Malin 1, is a spiral behind the VIRGO CLUSTER ; its disk is invisible on typically exposed images. Although difficult to detect, low-surface brightness galaxies may be quite common and account for an important fraction of the total mass in GALAXY CLUSTERS . L star New spectral class formally added in 1999 to the cool end of the SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION system (as w ere TST ARS ), making the sequence OBAFGKMLT. The class was needed as a result of the ability of new infrared technologies to find cool, red – really infrared – stars. L stars are characterized by deep red colours and no hydrogen lines; metallic hydrides (CrH, FeH) replace the metallic oxides (TiO and VO) of MST ARS . TiO is still present in the warmer L types, but it precipitates into solid mineral form and disappears completely in the cooler types. L stars exhibit powerful, remarkably broad resonance lines of the alkali metals sodium, potassium, r ubidium and caesium. Temperatures range from 2000 K at L0 down to around 1500 K at L9, and are so low that visual radiation is effectively non-existent (that is, L stars in general have no visual magnitudes, only red and infrared magnitudes). The masses of L stars range downwards from about 0.08 solar mass, which is near the critical mass required for full hydrogen fusion to operate. The warmer L stars are a mixture of real stars just off the end of class M and BROWN DWARFS . The cooler L stars are all brown dwarfs. Unlike the traditional classes, there are no giant or super- g iant L stars because giants and supergiants cannot become so cool. Like cool M stars, L stars are convective and should possess no magnetic fields (which are thought to be anchored on radiatively stable cores). Also like cool M stars, L stars have been seen to flare, which is the only form of variation known among them. LT E Abbreviation of LOCAL THERMODYNAMIC EQUILIBRIUM luminosity T otal amount of ENERGY emitted by a star per second in all wavelengths. It is dependent on the radius of the star and its temperature. Luminosity is usually expressed in units of watts. luminosity class P arameter describing the size of a STAR . It is usually combined with the spectral class to add a second dimension in the Yerkes System. The classes range from I, for a SUPERGIANT , through III, for a GIANT , to V, for a DW ARF STAR . There are a number of subdivisions to these to provide a finer description. See also SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION luminosity function Numerical distribution of stars (or galaxies) among different values of LUMINOSITY or ABSOLUTE MAGNITUDE . Values of the luminosity function are usually expressed as the number of stars per cubic parsec within a given range of luminosity or absolute magnitude. The value of the luminosity function in the solar neigh- bourhood increases to a maximum at absolute magnitudes of 14–15, and decreases again at higher (fainter) magni- tude values. This implies that faint M-type dwarfs of about one ten-thousandth of the solar luminosity are the most abundant type of star locally. Luminosity functions can also be plotted for special categories of object, such as stars of particular spectral classes, stellar clusters, galaxies or clusters of galaxies. luminous blue variable See S DORADÛS STAR Luna Series of 24 spacecraft used (1959–76) by the Soviet Union for robotic exploration of the Moon.

Lunar eclipses, which may be total or partial, can occur only at full moon when Sun, Earth and Moon are in line. Since the Moon’s orbit is inclined at 5º.15 to that of the Earth, lunar eclipses do not occur every month; they can only happen when full moon occurs at or close to the ascending or descending node of its orbit. The w estwards movement – regression – of the nodes means that lunar eclipses occur in ‘seasons’, separated by an ECLIPSE YEAR of 346.62 days. Lunar eclipses usually precede or follow SOLAR ECLIPSES by a fortnight. As the Sun is an extended light source, Earth’s shadow has two components – a dark, central UMBRA , where the Sun is completely obscured, and a lighter outer PENUM - BRA , within which the obscuration is partial. During a lunar eclipse, the Moon passes first through the penum- bra, taking about an hour, moving eastwards by its own diameter in this time, to reach the western edge of the umbra. During the penumbral phase, the light of the full moon is only slightly reduced. In some cases, where the Moon is only just too far north or south of the node to pass through the umbra, a PENUMBRAL ECLIPSE is seen. F ollowing FIRST CONTACT , the Moon’s more easterly limb will show a growing dark ‘nick’ as it begins to enter the umbra more deeply. At a total lunar eclipse, the Moon takes about an hour to become completely immersed in the umbra. To begin with, there is little to see beyond a darkening of part of the Moon, but as the eclipsed portion increases, some colour may become evi- dent. The curved edge of the umbra may show a slight blue fringe. Refraction of sunlight – particularly at the red end of the spectrum – through Earth’s atmosphere means that the umbra is not completely dark. Conse- quently, the Moon does not usually disappear from view; instead, it is dimmed and often takes on a reddish colour, which becomes increasingly apparent as the umbral phase advances. At totality, the Moon – completely immersed in shadow – normally shows red, orange and y ellow colours, often with some gradation. Those parts of the Moon closer to the edge of the umbra often appear somewhat brighter and more yellowish than those towards the centre, which are redder. At the distance of the Moon’s orbit, the dark shadow cone of Earth’s umbra subtends a diameter of about 9200 km (5700 mi). The duration of totality in a lunar eclipse depends on how nearly centrally the Moon passes through the umbra: a central passage gives a maximum duration of 1 hour 47 minutes. During totality, any lighter border on the Moon will appear to move gradual- ly round from the westerly to the easterly limb. Totality ends when the Moon’s easterly limb re-emerges into sunlight, and over the next hour or so the full moon exits the umbra to regain its usual brilliance, thereafter clear- ing the penumbra. No two lunar eclipses are ever quite the same, and although some dismiss them as of less interest than solar eclipses – particularly total solar eclipses, where the events centred on totality occur rapidly, in contrast with the more stately progress of a lunar eclipse – they are fas- cinating to observe. Lunar eclipses also have the advan- tage of being visible from the entire hemisphere of the Earth where the Moon is above the horizon, rather than being most impressive along a narrow track. The main difference from one event to another is the degree to which the totally eclipsed Moon is darkened, and how colourful it might be. The level of darkening is often described in terms of the D ANJON SCALE . Total lunar eclipses following major v olcanic eruptions, which greatly increase the dust load and opacity of the upper atmosphere, can often be notably dark, as was the case with the 1992 December 9–10 eclipse, a year after the Mount Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines. Not only are these events relatively dark, they also lack much of the colour seen at other times. By contrast, eclipses that occur when the upper atmosphere is fairly dust-free are often bright and strongly coloured, an example being the 1989 August 17 event. Lunar eclipse brightness can also be influenced by the amount of cloud in Earth’s atmosphere. The diameter of Earth’s umbra is thought by some to change in response to solar activity, perhaps decreasing at solar maximum as the upper atmosphere becomes slightly more extended in response to increased ultraviolet and X- ray emissions. Many observers try to measure the precise extent of the umbra during eclipses by timing the passage of its edge across identifiable lunar features such as craters. Unless a lunar eclipse is very dark, it is usually quite easy to make out the dark maria, contrasting with the brighter, cratered highlands, with the naked eye. Tele- scopic observations during totality sometimes suggest that some craters, notably Aristarchus, appear markedly brighter than their surroundings. lunar meteorite METEORITE that originated on the Moon. There are currently 18 known lunar meteorites, 15 of which have been collected in Antarctica. Several are gabbroic or basaltic in nature, but the majority are anorthositic regolith breccias.

See also APOLLO PROGRAMME Lunar Orbiter Series of five NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) spacecraft that were designed for lunar photography in order to aid selection of suitable landing sites for the Apollo missions. They were launched at three-monthly intervals between 1966 August and 1967 August. Images were recorded on fine-grain photographic film which was processed on board and scanned for transmission back to Earth. The highest spatial resolution achieved was about 2 m (80 in.). Almost all of the Moon’s farside was imaged, and many scientifically interesting formations on the nearside were photographed. See also APOLLO PROGRAMME Lunar Prospector Third of NASA’s low-cost, Discovery-class missions; it was intended to provide global data on key characteristics of the MOON . The 296-kg spacecraft entered lunar orbit four days after its launch on 1998 January 6. From a 100-km (60-mi) circular, polar-mapping orbit, the spacecraft’s suite of five science instruments was able to map the entire Moon and update existing data, largely from the Apollo era, which concentrated on the equatorial regions. One of the most dramatic ‘discoveries’ was the announcement that the neutron spectrometer had found a definitive signal for water ice at both of the lunar poles. Analysis of the data indicated that a significant quantity of wa ter ice, possibly as much as 3000 megatonnes, was mixed into the REGOLITH at each pole, with a greater quantity existing at the north pole. Further analysis showed that the suspected water ice appeared to be in dis- crete deposits buried under the lunar soil. Another intriguing result was the discovery of localized magnetic fields on the Moon, which were located diamet- r ically opposite young, large-impact basins. Gravity mea- surements detected a number of new mass concentrations, while other data indicated that the Moon’s iron core is very small. Lunar Prospector’s six-month-long extended mission began in 1999 January. Swooping to within 10 km (6 mi) of the surface, it provided scientists with much higher res- olution data. By the end of this phase, the spacecraft had provided a high-quality gravity map of the Moon, global magnetic field maps, and global absolute abundances of 11 key elements, including hydrogen. The dramatic finale came on 1999 July 31, when the spacecraft was deliberately deorbited and crashed into a permanently shadowed crater near the Moon’s south pole. Scientists hoped that the impact might create a cloud of wa ter vapour, proving once and for all that water exists on the Moon. However, no positive results were obtained. Lunar Rover (Lunar Roving Vehicle) Battery-powered v ehicle that was provided on the last three Apollo missions. It greatly improved astronaut mobility and dramatically increased the area that could be explored. The 220-kg rover was carried to the Moon in a storage bay on the LUNAR MODULE descent stage. Distances covered by each rover were: Apollo 15, 27 km (17 mi); Apollo 16, 27 km (17 mi); and Apollo 17, 36 km (22 mi). See also APOLLO PROGRAMME lunar transient phenomenon (LTP) Short-duration (usually a few seconds to a few minutes) change observed to occur in the appearance of lunar surface features. Most LTPs are flashes or glows of light or dark obscurations of lunar features, or portions of them, documented by visual observers, but some, notably bright flashes of light that may be meteoric impacts, have been imaged by photography or CCDs. At least three different mechanisms may account for such events – impact flashes, release of gas from a vent, and the electrostatic elevation of dust. Impact events are the most easily distinguished. These are visualized as bright flashes of extremely short duration, and are caused by the vaporization of impactor and target materials. The L Lunar Orbiter 236 \u0001 Lunar Orbiter Lunar Orbiter 1 obtained this first-ever view of Earth from a spacecraft orbiting the Moon on 1966 August 23.

While Apollo seismometers revealed numerous impact events, most were far below the visible detection limit. The larger impacts, however, may be visu- alized, and have recently been recorded on videotape images of the Moon during strong displays of the LEONIDS . The release of gas, accompanied by surface dust, may also produce a temporary brightening. This would appear more as a ‘glow’, and would last longer (until the gas dissi- pated and the dust settled). One such LTP was spectro- g raphically photographed in 1958 ( see ALPHONSUS ), and later Apollo missions detected radon gas from orbit. A suggested mechanism is that radon gas accumulates in crustal pockets, increasing in pressure until release occurs via a conduit (fault) to the surface. This correlates with the data that such emissions are associated with maria, are locally repetitive, and occur where faults are expected to occur (the three most common areas being ARISTARCHUS , PLATO and Alphonsus). The electrostatic elevation of dust may produce a tran- sient glow with obscuration of surface features. Under lab- oratory conditions, irradiation of lunar surface materials with ultraviolet and visible light produced an increase in electrical conductivity of several orders of magnitude. As the TERMINATOR crosses the surface, conditions may occur for sufficient electrostatic charge to levitate dust from the surface. Such events must be uncommon. lunation Time interval between one new moon and the next. It corresponds to the SYNODIC MONTH of 29.53059 days. Lundmark, Knut Emil (1889–1958) Swedish astronomer, from 1929 director of Lund Observatory, who studied the nature and distances of galaxies. In 1919 he found evidence suggesting that the Solar System moves in the plane of the Milky Way, concluding from further studies (1924) that this movement was rotational. Lundmark’s measurements of their radial velocities (1925) suggested that galaxies are receding at velocities that increase with increasing distance – a conclusion later codified in HUBBLE ’ SLAW (1929). These insights were made possible by Lundmark’s use of novae and supernovae (which he showed to be intrinsically very different) in other galaxies as distance indicators, based on the assumption that they had luminosities similar to their counterparts in the Milky Way. Lund Observatory Swedish observatory that can trace its roots back to 1672. Located in central Lund, it is oper- a ted by Lund University’s Astronomy Department.

Lunik See LUNA lunisolar precession Combined effect of the gr a vitational pull of the Sun and the Moon on the Earth, which causes the gradual PRECESSION of the rotational axis. Precession causes the CELESTIAL POLES slowly to drift, describing a circle in the sky of radius 23º.5 (the inclination of the Earth’s axis) over a period of some 25,800 years, the effect only being noticeable over a few decades. Lunisolar precession amounts to around 50 \u0001 .4 per year and the Moon’s contribution is about twice that of the Sun because it is that much closer.

The first was soft-landed by LUNA 17 in north-west Mare Imbrium in 1970 November. The second was carried by Luna 21 and touched down on the eastern Mare Serenitatis in 1973 January. Lupus See feature article Luyten, William (1899–1994) Dutch-American astronomer (born Willem Jacob Luyten) who spent most of his career at the University of Minnesota (1931–94), becoming an authority on stellar kinematics and discovering the majority of known white dwarfs. Luyten w as famous for his many surveys of PROPER MOTIONS , which he used to derive the stellar LUMINOSITY FUNCTION – this, in turn, allowed him accurately to map the stellar population of the solar neighbourhood. Luyten found that although only 0.5% of the Milky Way’s naked-eye stars are less luminous than the Sun, 96% within 2250 l.y. are less luminous. We see these stars only because they are close, but basing a star census on this population w ould give a misleading notion of the Galaxy’s overall stellar make-up. Luyten used a quantity known as reduced proper motion to relate the apparent and absolute magnitudes of stars to their proper motions, calibrating the mean proper motions using parallaxes. Between 1927 and 1963, he cal- culated proper motions for 120,000 stars in the southern hemisphere – the Bruce Proper Motion Survey. During this survey he found several hundred white dwarf stars, many SPECTROSCOPIC BINARIES , and UV CETI – the first flare star to be identified. In the 1950s he initiated the National Geographic Society’s P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY L Luyten, William 237 \u0001 Lunar Rover Astronauts on the later Apollo lunar landings were able to explore greater areas of the surface aboard Lunar Roving Vehicles.

The series ends at the Lyman limit at 91.2 nm. L ynx See feature article L yot, Bernard Ferdinand (1897–1952) French astrophysicist and instrument designer who worked at Meudon and Pic du Midi Observatories. He invented a coronagraph and a series of monochromatic filters ( see LYOT FILTER ) with transmissions as fine as 0.1 nm (1933–39). He also developed polarimeters to measure the polarization of light reflected by the surfaces of the Moon and planets, and used them to discover that Mars has dust storms and that the lunar surface is largely covered by v olcanic basalts. Lyot was the first to use cinematography to capture the motions of solar prominences and to probe the structure of the chromosphere. L yot filter Narrow waveband filter used for making observations of the Sun. The filter consists of alternating layers of polaroid sheets and quartz plates. The polarized light undergoes double refraction by the quartz plate and, when realigned by a further polaroid sheet, interference occurs, some wavelengths being cancelled and some reinforced. This results in a number of very narrow (0.1 nm) but widely spaced wavebands, which allows the desired wavelength to be easily isolated. It was devised by Bernard LYOT in 1933.

The shower, the radiant of which lies 10º south-west of Vega, usually produces comparatively modest rates, with maximum zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) 10–15. Stronger displays have been seen on occasion, notably on 15 BC March 27 when ‘stars fell like rain’, and in 1803 and 1922. An outburst on 1982 April 21–22 produced rates of 75–80 Lyrids per hour. Lyrid meteors are quite fast (49 km/s or 30 mi/s), with a reasonable proportion of bright events. The shower is associated with the long-period Comet C/1861 G1 Thatcher.

MACHO See MASSIVE COMPACT HALO OBJECT McMath–Pierce Solar Telescope W orld’s largest solar telescope, located at KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY , incorporating three separate optical instruments with apertures of 1.6 m (63 in.) for the main telescope and 0.9 m (36 in.) for the two auxiliaries. Unusually, these instruments have all-reflective optics with no windows, lenses or central obscuration, and produce a very high image quality. The McMath–Pierce is operated by the NATIONAL SOLAR OBSERVATORY . Completed in 1962, it is used mainly for solar spectroscopy, polarimetry and imag- ing, but also for planetary work and observations of comets. It also provides a unique facility for monitoring the Earth’s atmosphere. Mädler, Johann Heinrich (1794–1874) German astronomer who collaborated with amateur astronomer Wilhelm BEER to produce Mappa selenographica (1837), the first truly accurate and comprehensive map of the Moon. They constructed their map by making numerous micrometer measurements of feature positions and sizes, using only a 3.75-inch (95-mm) refractor. They also produced the first map of Mars to show its albedo features (1830). From 1840 Mädler directed Dorpat Observatory, Estonia, observing and cataloguing hundreds of double stars with the fine 9.6-inch (245-mm) refractor there. Maffei Galaxies Tw o relatively nearby galaxies in Cassiopeia. Lying close on the sky to the plane of the Milky Way, they are almost completely obscured by galactic dust and can only be detected at red or infrared wa v elengths. They were discovered in 1968 by the Italian astronomer Paolo Maffei (1926– ) as two infrared sources in line of sight close to the bright galaxy IC 1805. Their nature as faint, extended objects with the attributes of nearby galaxies raised the exciting possibility that they were newly discovered members of the LOCAL GROUP .

Magellan NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) mission to map the planet VENUS at high resolution, using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The spacecraft was launched from the Space Shuttle Atlantis on 1989 May 4 and inserted into a near- polar elliptical orbit around Venus, with a periapsis altitude of 294 km (183 mi), on 1990 August 10. Each mapping orbit typically imaged an area 20 km (12 mi) wide by 17,000 km (10,600 mi) long. The raw SAR data w ere then processed into image strips that were assembled into mosaics. The mission was divided up into ‘cycles’. Each cycle lasted 243 days, the time necessary for Venus to rotate once under the Magellan orbit. The first three cycles (1990 Sep- tember to 1992 September) were dedicated to radar map- ping of the surface. At the completion of this phase, 98% of the surface had been imaged at resolutions better than 100 m (330 ft), and many areas were imaged several times. The fourth and fifth cycles were mainly devoted to obtain- ing gravity data. During the final stages of the mission, sci- entists carried out a ‘windmill’ experiment to study the effects of atmospheric drag on the spacecraft. Although its primary objectives were to map the sur- face of Venus and determine its topographic relief, Mag- ellan also collected radar emissivity, radar reflectivity, slope and radio occultation data. 239 M M \u0001 McMath–Pierce Solar T elescope The main shaft of the McMath–Pierce Solar T elescope is 152 m (500 ft) long.

Both clouds are easily visible to the naked eye, appearing like isolated offshoots of the MILKY WAY with apparent diameters of about 6º (the LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD ) and 3º (the SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD ). Their distances are estimated to be about 170,000 and 190,000 l.y. respectively. The clouds are sufficiently close to the Earth for detailed observations to be made of stars and nebulae; such observations are not possible for more distant galaxies.

The rim is difficult to identify in places, while the EJECTA blanket has been completely eroded away. The walls are deeply incised by impact scars. The floor contains several small central peak remnants and later impact craters. magma Molten rock, predominantly silicate in composition; upon solidification it yields IGNEOUS ROCKS . magnetic field One of the fundamental forces of nature. Magnetic flux density, symbol B , is measured in units of tesla (T). Magnetic field strength, H , is related to magnetic flux density by the magnetic permeability, \u0001 , of the medium containing the magnetic field, with B = \u0001 H . It is measured in A/m. On Earth a weak magnetic field exists capable of swinging a compass. In astronomical objects the field can be more than 10 12 times stronger, and it then can control the motions of gases and the shape of objects. Planetary magnetic fields are often discussed in units of Gauss (G); 1 G = 0.0001 T. magnetic monopole Elementary particle that contains only one pole of a magnetic field. The existence of magnetic monopoles was predicted by symmetry considerations in elementary particle models and they w ere thought to be a single pole of a magnetic field. The fact that magnetic monopoles have never been detected in the Universe presented a minor problem for the BIG BANG THEORY . The theory of INFLATION , if correct, eases the constraints on the detection of magnetic monopoles and explains why they have yet to be seen. magnetic reconnection Mechanism for the exchange of energy from a magnetic field to a plasma, quoted as a possible acceleration mechanism in a wide variety of astrophysical phenomena, from planetary MAGNETOSPHERES , SOLAR FLARES and CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS , to A CCRETION DISKS and A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEI . Two regions of space or astrophysical plasma containing magnetic fields with different orientations are generally separated by a thin current layer; for example, the magnetopause separates a planetary magnetosphere from the SOLAR WIND . The two regions are thus not generally able to mix. Magnetic reconnection is thought to occur on such a current layer if the fields on either side are close to antiparallel. Under these circumstances, the fields on either side break and reconnect with their counterparts on the other side of the boundary. A magnetic link is created through the boundary, which allows the mixing of plasmas from each side along the reconnected field lines. In addition, magnetic energy is liberated from the system, and appears as thermal and kinetic energy of the plasmas on the reconnected field lines. The actual physical process involved in magnetic reconnection is not well understood. However, observations of plasmas at energies compatible with the reconnection process are widespread within the terrestrial magnetosphere, providing strong circumstantial evidence of its occurrence within astrophysical plasmas. magnetic star Va r iety of star that has a strong magnetic field, well beyond the typical level of the Sun. The most common examples are the magnetic AP STARS , which have odd chemical compositions (enhanced silicon, strontium and rare earths) and starspots; their related fields run from a few hundred into the tens of thousands of gauss (the Sun’s field has a strength of 2000–4000 gauss over active regions). Tw o classes of degenerate stars are strongly magnetic. A small percentage of DA (hydrogen-rich) WHITE DWARFS have fields in the megagauss (or even hundreds of mega- gauss) range. These stars tend to be relatively massive and are suspected to be the evolved descendants of the Ap stars. NEUTRON STARS are by their nature even more mag- netic. Typical field strengths for newly born pulsars are a million million (10 12 ) gauss. A small percentage of neu- tron stars, suspected to derive from higher mass super- novae, the ‘magnetars’, have fields a hundred times g reater, up to 10 14 gauss. magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) Study of the interactions between a PLASMA and a MAGNETIC FIELD . The science of magnetohydrodynamics was founded Magellanic Clouds 240 M \u0001 Magellan During the first phases of NASA’s Magellan mission, its orbit around Venus was highly elliptical (blue), and it used radar to map almost the whole planet. After three years, the orbiter used aerobraking techniques to reach a lower, circular orbit (red); it then mapped Venus’ gravity field.

It contains free electrons and positively charged nuclei. In most astronomical plasmas, the nuclei will be predominantly free protons. A plasma may also contain a proportion of neutral atoms, but their behaviour, in particular their motions, will be governed by that of the plasma as a whole. The plasma is highly electrically conducting so that if it moves across a magnetic field, an electric current is induced within it in exactly the same way that a current is induced in the copper wire of a dynamo moving through its magnetic field. The electric current in the plasma sets up its own magnetic field, which interacts with the original magnetic field in such a way that the relative motion between the field and plasma is opposed. The interaction may be sufficient to halt almost completely the relative motion of the plasma across the magnetic field lines. The magnetic field is then said to be ‘frozen-in’ to the plasma. The movement of the plasma is then constrained to follow the magnetic field lines or to move with the magnetic field if it should change; or the magnetic field is dragged with the plasma as it moves. Most of the material in the Universe is in the form of plasmas; therefore, magnetohydrodynamical behaviour is involved wherever there is also a magnetic field. On the Sun, for example, the shapes of both quiescent and active PROMINENCES clearly show linkage to magnetic fields; SUNSPOTS are cool and appear dark because the magnetic field within them inhibits convective transfer of heat; solar FLARES arise through magnetic field–plasma interactions, although there is still some uncertainty in understanding the exact process. There is also some uncertainty in exact- ly how the solar sunspot cycle arises, but it is again clearly linked to magnetic field interactions. Other magnetohy- drodynamic behaviour occurs in the formation of plane- tary MAGNETOSPHERES , within ACCRETION DISKS and STELLAR WINDS . Oscillations in the plasma and/or mag- netic field produce ALFVÉN WAVES . These move at the Alfvén speed where B is the magnetic field strength, \u0001 is the plasma density and \u0002 is the magnetic permeability of the plasma. Such waves may be involved in transferring energy out to the solar CORONA and are thus involved in maintaining its enormously high temperature. magnetopause Boundary separating a planetary MAGNETOSPHERE from the external SOLAR WIND . The magnetopause is a thin sheet of electrical current, only a few thousand kilometres thick. It is a crucial boundary at which the exchange of energy and matter between the solar wind and the magnetosphere occurs. This coupling is particularly strong at times when the solar wind magnetic field is directed antiparallel to the planetary magnetic field just inside the boundary, a situation probably caused by MAGNETIC RECONNECTION at the magnetopause. See also SPACE WEATHER magnetosphere Region surrounding a magnetized planet that is occupied by the planetary magnetic field; it acts to control the structure and dynamics of plasma populations and ionized particles within it. A magnetosphere can be considered as the magnetic sphere of influence of the planet. The size of the magnetosphere is controlled by the interaction of the planetary field with the SOLAR WIND , which compresses the upstream side while dragging the downwind side out into an extended magnetotail, resembling a windsock. The magnetosphere represents an obstacle to the supersonic solar wind flow from the Sun, with the solar wind having to flow around the magnetosphere. To do this, the wind is slowed, deflected and heated at a BOW SHOCK , standing in the flow upstream of the magnetosphere. The shocked solar wind plasma and associated magnetic field downstream of the bow shock is known as a magnetosheath. This region is separated from the magnetosphere proper by a layer of electrical current known as the MAGNETOPAUSE . In the solar direction, the magnetopause occurs at the point where the pressure associated with the planetary magnetic field balances the pressure of the impinging solar wind flow. As the solar wind pressure is highly variable, these boundaries expand outwards and contract inwards in response to these variations. In the terrestrial system, however, the subsolar points on the bow shock and magnetopause stand at average distances of 15 Earth radii (R E ) and 11 R E towards the Sun respectively. On the nightside, the deflected solar wind flow effectively creates a vacuum, which the planetary magnetic field expands to fill. MAGNETIC RECONNECTION occurring on the dayside magnetopause results in magnetic flux being peeled from the dayside and added to the nightside region. These two effects create the magnetospheric tail, or magnetotail. In the terrestrial case, this feature is approximately cylindrical, with a diameter of order 50–60 R E and a length that extends many thousands of Earth radii. A planetary magnetosphere contains a number of regions with distinct plasma or energetic charged particle populations. Closest to the planet, these regions include the RADIATION BELTS (the VA N ALLEN BELTS at th e Earth) and the PLASMASPHERE . The radiation belts contain trapped energetic particles captured from the solar wind or originating from collisions between upper atmosphere atoms and high-energy COSMIC RAYS . The plasmasphere is populated by the polar wind, an upflow of plasma from the upper IONOSPHERE . Farther out, the PLASMA SHEET occupies the central portion of the magnetotail and con- tains a hot plasma of solar wind origin. Each of these regions, indeed the magnetosphere as a whole, can be extremely dynamic, especially during times of enhanced solar wind–magnetosphere interaction. Magnetic storms and MAGNETOSPHERIC SUBSTORMS are disturbances that cause global restructuring of these magnetospheric regions and significant energization of the particle popula- tions within them. In addition, there is significant coupling between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. At the Earth this coupling is achieved by the flow of large-scale electrical currents from the magnetosphere through the polar ionosphere, which results in heating of the ionos- phere, particularly at disturbed times. It is also associated with spectacular displays of the AURORA . –––– B 2 √ ––– \u0002 \u0001 241 M \u0001 Magellanic Clouds The Large Magellanic Cloud in Dorado is the second closest external galaxy.

The magnetic field of Mercury is relatively weak (only one-hundredth of the terrestrial field), and thus it has a very small magnetosphere. How- ever, it still provides a definite interaction with the solar wind, with a well-defined bow shock and magnetopause. MARINER 10 observations suggest that magnetospheric substorms occur on timescales of minutes, rather than ov er one to two hours as occurs at Earth. Mercury has no significant atmosphere or ionosphere, although, curi- ously, these regions are known to be important for sub- storms in the terrestrial magnetosphere. The planet itself also occupies a large fraction of the magnetosphere, such that the regions that would constitute the radiation belts lie below the surface. The Jovian magnetosphere is the largest in the Solar System: if it could be visualized from the Earth, it would be seen to subtend a cross-section equivalent to the Moon’s diameter in the sky. It is extremely variable in size, extending to distances of between 50 and 100 R J in the direction of the Sun as a result of the changes in the solar wind. The magnetotail of Jupiter is so large that it extends over more than 5 AU and can interact with Sat- urn. The high-energy particles in Jupiter’s magnetic field also form radiation belts, which are 1000 times more intense than those of the Earth. Seven of Jupiter’s inner- most satellites and the rings are in this hostile region. These satellites are constantly bombarded by the high- energy particles, which erode the surfaces and alter their chemistry. In addition, the structure of the Jovian mag- netosphere is influenced by the moon IO , which adds plasma to the inner regions by volcanic processes, creat- ing a cloud of sodium, potassium and magnesium, known as the Io torus, stretching around Io’s orbit. The rapid rotation of Jupiter accelerates plasma from the torus to high velocities, and the resulting centrifugal force distorts the magnetosphere outwards, in its equato- r ial regions, to form the Jovian magnetodisk. Io and Jupiter are also connected by a magnetic flux tube, which carries a current of order 5 million amps across a poten- tial difference of 400,000 volts. This electrical energy plays an important role in the local heating of the surface of Io and the generation of the volcanic activity. Jupiter emits waves at radio frequencies, corresponding to deca- metric and decimetric regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, which are greater in intensity than any extraterrestrial source other than the Sun. The interac- tions between the charged particles and the Jovian a tmosphere produces polar aurorae, which are about 60 times brighter than their terrestrial counterparts. The Saturnian magnetosphere is intermediate in size between those of Jupiter and the Earth, and, similar to those, it is sensitive to variations of the solar wind. The VOYA GER 1 spacecraft crossed the bow shock five times, at distances ranging from 26.1 to 22.7 R S . A major dif- ference between the Saturnian magnetosphere and that of Jupiter is the concentration of highly electrically charged dust in the ring plane. It is possible that this material is the source of the high-energy discharges in the rings. At Saturn the large system of rings and many of the satellites have the effect of sweeping a path through the charged particle environment. The rings and the satellites are very efficient in absorbing the pro- tons in the magnetosphere. The Saturnian magnetos- phere is a major target of the CASSINI mission, due to arrive at Saturn in 2004. Uranus has an unusual magnetosphere in which the dipole magnetic field axis is tilted by an angle of 60º with respect to the planetary rotation axis, with a centre that is offset by 0.3 Uranus radii. At the time of the Voyager 2 encounter the Uranian magnetosphere extended 18 R U , and the magnetotail had a radius of 42 R U at a distance of 67 R U . The extreme tilt of the magnetic axis, combined with the tilt of the rotational axis, causes the field lines in the Uranian magnetotail to be wound up into a corkscrew configuration. Voyager 2 found radiation belts at Uranus of intensity similar to those at Saturn, although they differ in composition. The moons Miranda and Ariel modulate the flux of the trapped radiation. It is possible that this radiation environment is responsible for the creation of the unusually dark material found on the satellites and r ings of Uranus. There are also radio emissions from the magnetosphere of Uranus, although weaker than those from Saturn. A further magnetospheric interaction with the atmosphere, which is not known on Earth, is called the electroglow. This is only seen on the dayside of Uranus, where the aurorae are not observed. Neptune’s magnetic field is tilted 47º from the plan- et’s rotation axis, and is offset at least 0.55 R N from the planet’s centre. As a result of this unusual arrangement, Neptune’s magnetosphere goes through dramatic changes as the planet rotates in the solar wind. During each rotation, the magnetosphere moves from an orien- tation similar to that at Earth to one in which the south pole points head on into the solar wind, and then back again. The pole-on orientation of the magnetic field was observed when Voyager 2 flew into the southern cusp of Neptune’s magnetosphere in 1989. The spacecraft sub- sequently remained in the magnetosphere long enough to observe two of these rotation cycles. Voyager 2 detect- ed periodic radio emissions generated in the magnetos- phere. These waves provided the first accurate estimation of the rotation rate of the planet’s interior. Vo y ager 2 also detected weak aurorae in Neptune’s a tmosphere. Because of Neptune’s complex magnetic field, the aurorae occur over wide regions of the planet, not just near the planet’s magnetic poles. Finally, it is possible for unmagnetized bodies to exhibit magnetospheric-like behaviour. For example, the ionosphere of Venus and cometary comae also provide obstacles to the solar wind flow. The slowing of the flow in the vicinity of the body creates a draping of the solar wind magnetic field around the obstacle, thus creating an induced magnetotail. Regions of remnant surface mag- netization on the Moon and Mars also interact with the solar wind on a small scale, thus creating the ‘mini-mag- netospheres’ detected, for example, by the Mars Global Surveyor and Lunar Prospector missions. magnetospheric substorm Major reconfiguration of the terrestrial MAGNETOSPHERE resulting in an explosive release of energy stored in the magnetotail and subsequent deposition of this energy into the polar IONOSPHERE , RADIATION BELTS and downstream SOLAR WIND . The ‘growth phase’ of a magnetospheric substorm begins with a period of enhanced coupling between the solar wind and the magnetosphere, which may last several hours.

This energy is converted into fast plasma jets within the magnetotail plasma sheet and is also dissipated by a shear- ing off of a large portion of the tail plasma sheet to form a plasmoid, which is ejected away from the Earth and out into the solar wind. In the near-Earth region, energy is deposited as an injection of energetic particles into the radiation belts. A large, substorm-associated current con- nects the magnetosphere to the ionosphere, and flows across the ionosphere at auroral latitudes. This current dissipates energy by heating the ionosphere, and it is also associated with a major expansion of the nightside AURO - RA , both in the poleward and east–west directions. Spec- tacular high-latitude auroral displays are thus observed from the ground during substorms. Typically, after about 30–60 minutes activity dies away, and the magnetosphere and ionospheric systems relax to their pre-substorm state during the ‘recovery phase’. Magnetospheric substorms are thought to occur at a much faster rate at Mercury, and probably also occur in the other magnetized planets. magnification F actor by which an optical system increases the apparent size of an object. It is a measure of the increase in the angle subtended by the object at the observer’s eye. It is usually designated by ‘ \u0001 ’ used before or after the magnification power; for example, eight times magnification would be written as \u0001 8 or 8 \u0001 . In the specification of a pair of binoculars two numbers are usually given, separated by \u0001 ; the first is the magnification. F or example, 10 \u0001 50 binoculars have a magnification of ten times and an entrance aperture 50 mm in diameter. The magnification of a telescope can be calculated by dividing the FOCAL LENGTH of the OBJECTIVE by the focal length of the EYEPIECE . A telescope with a focal length of 1000 mm would give a magnification of 50 \u0001 when used with an eyepiece of focal length 20 mm. magnitude Brightness of an astronomical body. APPARENT MAGNITUDE 1 is exactly 100 times brighter than magnitude 6, each magnitude being 2.512 times brighter than the next. Magnitudes brighter than 0 are minus figures, thus Sirius is \u0002 1.4, and the Sun is \u0002 26.8. The faintest objects yet photographed are about magnitude 26.

Most such bodies are dynamically stable, and they are believed to have remained in that part of the Solar System since their formation more than 4.5 billion years ago. The main-belt asteroids represent chunks of solid material, mostly rock and metal, which failed to form a major planet because of the effect of the gravitational perturbations of Jupiter. Their total remnant mass is small – only about 5% the mass of the Moon. main sequence Region of the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM where most stars are found. It runs diagonally from top left (high temperature, high luminosity stars) to bottom right (low temperature, low luminosity stars). Stars spend most of their lifetime on the main sequence, and a main-sequence star is one in which energy is primarily produced from the fusion of hydrogen into helium in its core. The original line formed by stars shortly after their igni- tion is called the ZERO - AG E MAIN SEQUENCE . As composi- tional changes alter the internal structures of these stars, the points that represent them on the HR diagram will move aw ay from the main sequence and trace out an evolutionary track on the diagram (see also STELLAR EVOLUTION ). Main-sequence stars are the most common type of star in the GALAXY : they constitute some 90% of the approxi- mately 10 11 stars in the Galaxy and contribute about 60% of its total mass. From a theoretical point of view main- sequence stars are common because stars spend most of their evolutionary lives on the main sequence. The time for which a star remains on the main sequence is related to the ratio of its mass to its luminosity. Using the MASS – LUMINOSITY RELATION , this gives rough main-sequence lifetimes proportional to M \u0002 3.7 for solar- type stars and M \u0002 0.6 for very high-mass stars (where M is the mass of the star). Very low-mass stars are fully convec- tive and can continue core hydrogen fusion for much longer than its mass–luminosity ratio would suggest, giv- ing a star of mass one tenth of a solar mass a main- sequence lifetime of around 10 13 y ears. The internal structure of a main-sequence star consists of a core depleted in hydrogen (to a degree determined by the time it has spent on the main sequence; that is, the time since NUCLEAR REACTIONS first started in its interior), surrounded by a hydrogen-rich envelope. In stars heavier than the Sun the principal nuclear reaction network is the CARBON – NITROGEN – O XYGEN CYCLE and the core is mixed by convection. In lower-mass stars the nuclear energy generation comes from the PROTON – PROTON REACTION and there is no convection in the core. An outer convec- tion zone, extending in from the surface of the star, increases in depth for lower-mass stars. For stars of SPEC - TRAL TYPE A0 (about 3 solar masses) there is little or no convective envelope; at the mass of the Sun the convection zone reaches in about a quarter of the way to the centre; at about 0.3 solar mass the zone reaches the centre. The relatively short lifetimes of the hottest main- sequence stars result in their being very rare in the Galaxy, whereas the lifetimes of the lowest mass (spectral type K and M or RED DWARFS ) are so long that none has evolved from the main sequence since the Galaxy was first formed. This strong lifetime dependence, together with the fact that the processes of star formation produce far more low-mass than high-mass stars, results in the lower- mass dwarfs being much more populous. Most main-sequence stars have the same abundances of hydrogen and helium as the Sun, and have abundances of the heavier elements which are within a factor of two of those in the Sun. For stars with masses less than 0.08 times that of the Sun, the core temperatures do not become high enough to start hydrogen-burning nuclear reactions; as a result the main sequence terminates at stars with surface temperatures of about 2500 K. However, lower-mass stars are formed, probably in even greater numbers than the M red dwarfs, and become BROWN DWARFS . An upper limit to the masses of main-sequence stars is determined by the increase of radiation pressure in their interiors: above about 150 solar masses the outward force exerted by radiation exceeds the attractive force of gravi- ty, preventing such a star from being formed, or making it unstable with a short lifetime if it does form ( see also STELLAR MASS ). At various places along the main sequence variability of luminosity is found, such as in Beta Cephei, Delta Scuti, oscillating Ap and flare stars (see also V ARIABLE STARS ). As well as the intrinsic properties of main-sequence stars, their space velocities show some interesting correla- tions with other stellar properties. The dispersion of their v elocities increases towards lower masses. This is a conse- quence of the increase in average age of stars at lower masses: stars of all masses are probably formed with approximately the same dispersion in space velocities, but the mechanisms that act to increase the dispersion have longer to work on those stars that remain as main-sequence stars for the longest time. Thus O and B stars evolve off the main sequence before their velocity dispersions have changed much from their initial values, but among the M main-sequence stars there is a spread of ages from that of the Galaxy itself down to the most recent ones formed. Over long periods of time, encounters with massive inter- stellar clouds (and, to a lesser extent, other stars) change the orbits of stars in the Galaxy, increasing their velocity dispersion. Thus the oldest M main-sequence stars have g reatly increased dispersions.

The term distinguishes them from the ASTEROIDS or minor planets. There is some debate as to whether Pluto, because of its size, warrants classification as a major planet. Maksutov, Dmitri Dmitrievich (1896–1964) Soviet optician and telescope-maker, born in the Ukraine, who designed the type of reflecting telescope now named after him. He organized a laboratory of astronomical optics at the State Optical Institute in Leningrad (now St P etersburg), where he designed and then built (1941) the first of several MAKSUTOV TELESCOPES . The meniscus- shaped optical surface employed by Maksutov was later used to build ultra-fast, ultra-wide-angle systems. Maksutov also was a principal designer of the SPECIAL ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY ’s 6-m (236-in.) reflector, at one time the world’s largest telescope. Maksutov telescope Modification of the SCHMIDT TELESCOPE design, using a spherical corrector plate whose convex side faces the PRIMARY mirror. It was devised independently by Albert Bouwers (1893–1972) in 1940 and Dmitri MAKSUTOV in 1944. The design has the advantage of being cheap and easy to produce, mak- ing it popular for short-tube amateur telescopes. Silver- ing of a spot in the centre of the corrector plate allows visual and photographic use in a CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE configuration. Maksutov telescopes are free from COMA and ASTIGMATISM , and almost free from CHROMATIC ABERRATION , while their enclosed tubes obviate problems with internal air currents. mantle Intermediate region of a planetary body that has experienced DIFFERENTIATION ; the mantle is the v olume between the CORE and CRUST . Earth’s mantle extends from the base of the crust, at depths of a few tens of kilometres, to the the core–mantle boundary at about 2700 km (1700 mi); it comprises about two thirds of the mass of the planet. The mantle is divided into layers, which increase in density with depth, probably due to changes in composition and pressure-induced changes in crystal structure. Although it is mostly solid, material in Earth’s mantle moves slowly (a few centimetres per year) because of convection driven by internal heat; it is this movement that drives continental drift. The other terrestrial planets and the Moon also have silicate mantles. The term mantle is also used for the thick layer of ice that overlies the core of a differentiated icy body. many-body problem (n-body problem) Problem in CELESTIAL MECHANICS of finding how a number ( n ) of bodies move under the influence of their mutual gravita- tional attraction. The nine planets plus the Sun form a ten-body problem, which is far too complicated to tackle using traditional analytical methods. Instead, the problem of determining Saturn’s orbit can be treated as a series of THREE - BODY PROBLEMS : Saturn orbiting the Sun per- turbed by Jupiter, Saturn orbiting the Sun perturbed by Uranus, and so on. One instance in which nine bodies (Pluto excluded) are considered together is in the deter- mination of the secular PERTURBATIONS of their orbits. This problem is simplified by ignoring the rapid longi- tude motions of the planets, and regarding all ECCEN - TRICITIES and INCLINATIONS as small. With the advent of powerful computers it is now perfectly feasible to tackle the ten-body problem by numerical integration of their orbits, and this is the way that the current planetary ephemerides are generated.

The nephew of Giovanni Domenico CASSINI , he collaborated (1700–1718) with Jacques CASSINI to determine the Paris longitudinal meridian. Maraldi was also an astute planetary observer. In 1704 he noticed the Martian polar caps and later mapped their va ri a tions, concluding that they were made of some kind of ice. He is known to historians as Maraldi I to distinguish him from Maraldi II – his nephew, the astronomer Giovanni Domenico Maraldi (1709–88), also known as Jean Dominique. mare Dark plain on the MOON ; the name comes from the Latin meaning ‘sea’, and refers to the belief that the dark patches on the Moon were ancient oceans. The maria are now known to represent lava flows. They stand as one of the major geologic units of the Moon, the other one being the HIGHLANDS . Because the maria and highlands have a different mineral composition, they stand out from one another: the highlands are light, while the maria are dark because of their lower reflectance of sunlight. Lunar lava formed in the Moon’s mantle, where radioactive elements decayed producing heat. When that heat reached a certain level, it melted the surrounding rocks (olivine, pyroxene), producing magmas that were low in silica but high in magnesium and iron (called ‘mafic’). These magmas, lower in density than the sur- rounding rocks, began to rise towards the surface. Upon nearing the crust, the magmas tracked up the deep faults that had been created by large impacts. The largest impacts on the Moon produced BASINS , which are immense structures, generally 300–1200 km (190–750 mi) in size, characterized by having two or more ring-like walls surrounding a flat central region. More importantly, these impacts deeply fractured the bedrock, thus providing conduits for ascending magmas and topographically low regions for lavas to pond. Thus, the maria are generally found in basins, and are usually restrained by one of the basin’s rings. The extent of flood- ing was variable, however, and so produced a variety of shapes for the final basin-mare form: (1) the lava may have been restrained by a basin ring (for example, the ring around Mare CRISIUM ); (2) the lavas may have flooded ov er an inner ring(s) producing a ‘circular’ mare ridge system; and (3) the lavas may have broken through the outer ring to flood adjacent low-lying areas (for example, Mare IMBRIUM , Mare SERENITATIS ). The set of features that is especially associated with basin rings is the circular mare ridge system, within and roughly concentric to a basin wall. When lava floods a basin, it subsides by compaction and mass loading. As the lava sags, it generates compressive forces that are expressed where the lava thins, such as over basin rims, and there the mare ridges form. Thus, these circular mare ridges mark the underlying basin rings, and they major planet 244 M \u0001 mare Mare Humorum is a lava-filled basin on the Moon, some 370 km (230 mi) in diameter.

Examples are visible in Mare Serenitatis and Mare HUMORUM . Significantly, the lavas failed to cover the highest peaks in two of the Imbrium Basin’s inner r ings (for example, Mons Piton and Mons PICO ). Thus, here the inner rings are marked by both mare ridges and individual peaks. One other volcanic feature often associated with the maria are dark mantling deposits. These are consider- ably darker areas located around the edges of certain maria. Apollo 17 visited one such site in Mare Sereni- tatis, where astronauts found glass beads in the regolith. This kind of glass is produced by a process called fire fountaining, which occurs when magma containing dis- solved gasses ascends. As the confining pressure is released, the gasses come out of solution. If there is enough gas in the fluid magma, it will both disrupt the magma and act as a propellant, lobbing magma droplets high above the surface. Here the droplets rapidly cool, forming a volcanic ash composed of small glass beads. As the lunar variety of glass is high in certain metals (such as titanium), it assumes a dark colour. Maria Mitchell Observatory Small observatory on Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts, founded in 1902 to commemorate Maria MITCHELL , the first woman professor of astronomy in the United States. It is now operated by the Maria Mitchell Associ- a tion, which aims to increase knowledge and public aw areness of the Universe and the natural world. The Association supports both public astronomy and astro- nomical research, and since 1997 has presented the annual Maria Mitchell Women in Science Award. marine chronometer Mechanical clock capable of keeping time accurately for long periods on board a small ship at sea. While latitude is easily found by observing the Sun or stars, finding longitude at sea requires an accurate knowledge of the time. Although land-based pendulum clocks had achieved the necessary precision by the 17th century, they could not be used at sea because the motions of a ship disturbed the pendulum too much, not to men- tion variations in temperature and humidity. In 1714 the British Parliament passed the Longitude Act, which offered a prize of £20,000 for a satisfactory solution to this problem. A useful marine chronometer which depended on a balance-wheel escapement was ulti- mately devised by John HARRISON . Thereafter, the develop- ment of chronometers proceeded rapidly. Chronometers remained essential until the general availability of reliable radio time signals in the 1920s and 1930s. Nowadays, most practical navigation makes use of the GLOBAL POSI - TIONING SYSTEM (GPS) satellites. Mariner spacecraft Series of ten US planetary probes, of which seven were successful. Mariner 2 was the first probe to reach VENUS (1962). Mariner 4 achieved the first successful flyby of MARS , sending back pictures of a cratered surface (1964). Mariner 5 made a close flyby of Venus in 1967. Mariners 6 and 7 extended the mapping of Mars, including the south polar region (1969). Mariner 9 went into orbit around Mars, becoming the first spacecraft to be placed in orbit around another planet (1971). Mariner 10 flew past Venus before becoming the first spacecraft to study MERCURY . Marius, Simon (1570–1624) German mathematician and astronomer whose career was characterized by controversy. In 1608 he learned of Hans LIPPERSHEY ’s design for a telescope and quickly made one from spectacle lenses. He was the first to use a telescope to observe the ANDROMEDA GALAXY (1612), but could not resolve its spiral structure. In 1614 he claimed to have discovered the four brightest satellites of Jupiter in 1609 November. Because of the five-year delay, he was accused of falsifying his observations by GALILEO , whom the scientific community had credited for this discovery. However, reliable records show that Marius observed the Galilean moons at least as early as December 1610. Markab The star \u0001 P egasi, visual mag. 2.49, distance 140 l.y., spectral type A0 III.

Markarian galaxies included the first large examples of SEYFERT GALAXIES , as well as many STARBURST GALAXIES and some QU ASISTELLAR OBJECTS and BL LACERTAE OBJECTS . Mars F ourth major planet from the Sun, popularly known as the Red Planet. Mars is intermediate in size between the Earth and Mercury. Mars’ coloration is a function of widespread regions of reddish dust, which on occasions may be raised high into the tenuous Martian a tmosphere by winds. A great dust storm was observed at close quarters in 1971 by the American spacecraft MARINER 9 as it approached the planet and eventually w ent into orbit around it. This storm reached global proportions, taking months to abate. On the surface the dust collects into vast sand-sheets and dune fields. T elescopically, Mars shows bright regions at the poles, sometimes bright areas at the LIMB or TERMINATOR , and va r ious dark markings. Most early observers believed the dark features to be seas, but when, in the 19th century, it became apparent that the atmosphere was too tenuous for this to be the case, the consensus view became that they w ere dried-up sea beds supporting lowly vegetation. T ogether with the Martian CANALS theory, this supposi- tion has been long rejected by scientists. The atmosphere of Mars is extremely tenuous, being only 1/150th that of Earth. Ninety-five per cent of it is car- bon dioxide, the rest being nitrogen (2.7%), argon (1.6%) and very small amounts of oxygen, carbon monoxide and wa ter vapour (0.03%). The thin atmosphere, coupled with Mars’ eccentric orbit and axial tilt, leads to a wide tempera- ture range, from 136 K (over the winter south polar cap) to 299 K (after noon in summer), with a mean of 250 K. Most of the V OLATILES are frozen out of the atmosphere in the polar caps, but there is sufficient water vapour for water ice clouds to form at altitudes from 10 to 15 km (6–9 mi) in 245 M \u0001 Mars The atmosphere on Mars is extremely tenuous.

Dust storms are also common, though only the largest can be seen from Earth. The most extensive storms occur near perihelion, when the temperature is relatively high and the southern polar cap is rapidly evaporating and releasing volatiles to increase the atmospheric pressure. Wind speeds during these phenomena may reach as much as 400 km/hr (250mi/hr) but average a few tens of km/hr. Many major Martian dust storms have begun in the Hellas, Argyre, Chryse and Isidis basins, and in and around the V ALLES MARINERIS complex. Dust deposition causes the contours of the dark regions of the planet to change slightly with time, and colours the Martian sky pink. Since the Mariners of the 1960s, the VIKINGS of the 70s, MARS PATHFINDER in 1997 and the ongoing MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR , the topography and geology of Mars has become known in some detail. The planet is believed to have an iron-rich core, some 2900 km (1800 mi) across, and it exhibits a magnetic field hundreds of times w eaker than Earth’s. The MANTLE may be 3500 km (2200 mi) thick, and the crust some 100 km (60 mi) deep. There is a hemispheric asymmetry to the planet: much of the southern hemisphere is up to 3 km (2 mi) above datum (datum being an arbitrary height at which the pressure is 6.2 millibars) and is heavily cratered. The high density of craters suggests that this terrain is as old as the highland regions of Earth’s Moon. The two large impact basins HELLAS PLANITIA and ARGYRE PLANITIA are located in this hemisphere. In several places this ancient cratered terrain is cut by gullies and complex channel systems, which appear to have been incised by wa ter. Several tongues of the cratered surface extend into the northern hemisphere. Most of the northern hemisphere is less heavily cratered and much is below datum. The surface looks altogether ‘smoother’ on the large scale. The most impressive features of this hemisphere are the vast shield volcanoes of THARSIS MONTES and the extensive valley network known as Valles Marineris, both first revealed in Mariner 9 images. The Tharsis region is in the nature of a huge bulge in the Mars lithosphere; it has a size roughly the same as that of Africa south of the Congo river, 4000 \u0001 3000 km (2500 \u0001 1900 mi). The entire Tharsis region rises to some 9 km (6 mi) above datum, but it rises to heights of up to 18 km (11 mi) in the large shield volcanoes ASCRAEUS MONS and PA V ONIS MONS . The great volcano OLYMPUS MONS , 1500 km (930 mi) to the west, rises to 24 km (15 mi) above datum. A similar but smaller bulge resides in the region known as Elysium, containing the volcanoes Elysi- um Mons, Hecates Tholus and Albor Tholus. These shield volcanoes, in terms of profile, are analo- gous to Earth’s Hawaiian volcanoes, such as Mauna Loa. They are, however, substantially larger and have vast summit depressions (calderas) crowning them. Very extensive lava flows can be traced radiating out from these constructs.

Contin- ued activity over a long period, aided by the low Martian gr a vity, has enabled high volcanic mountains to form. The planet is probably geologically inactive today. Olympus Mons seems relatively young, perhaps 30 mil- lion years old, but the oldest volcanoes are estimated to be up to 3.4 billion years old. To the east of Tharsis is an impressive canyon system named Valles Marineris. It extends from near the summit of the bulge at 5ºS l00ºW for 4500 km (2800 mi) east- w ards, eventually merging into an immense area of ‘chaot- ic terrain’ between Aurorae Planum and Margaritifer Te r ra. Valles Marineris marks a vast faulted area up to 600 km (370 mi) wide at the widest point; in places it falls 7 km (4 mi) below the rim. The oldest recognisable features are the roughly circular impact basins, of which the most prominent is Hellas Plani- tia. Also prominent are Argyre Planitia and ISIDIS PLANITIA . A number of other, generally less well-defined basins have been recognized on spacecraft images. For instance, CHRYSE PLANITIA is believed to occupy an ancient multi- r inged basin, although the surrounding ramparts are not so clearly defined as those of Argyre and Hellas Planitia. The most exciting of all Martian features are the ‘out- flow channels’, in no way related to the illusory canali. These channels can be several hundred kilometres long and tens of kilometres wide. They generally start abrupt- ly, without tributaries. Most channels are located north of the great canyon system and converge on the plain known as Chryse Planitia, although others appear to be associated with Elysium’s north-west edge. They seem to be related to a period of flooding in the distant past, when the climate was quite different from that of today and liquid water (probably ice-covered) could have existed in quantity on the Martian surface. Standing wa ter could have extended beyond Chryse, but the mat- ter is controversial. Mars Global Surveyor imaging greatly surpassed the resolution of the Viking Orbiters, enabling several intrigu- ing discoveries to be made. High resolution images revealed many dozens of small channels within craters, each apparently carved by running water. These features are generally more than 30º from the equator. Each feature resembles a terrestrial gully, exhibiting boulders, a winding channel and debris at the bottom of the flow. The lack of associated small impact features implies a geologically recent history. The channels might have been eroded by wa ter suddenly released behind a plug of ice. There are also many examples of what look like small, dried-up Mar- tian lakes, which display apparent sedimentary layering: these have mostly been imaged at low latitudes in canyons and deep craters. In this instance, however, dust deposits could also have masqueraded as sedimentary strata. The Viking Lander probes took panoramic pho- tographs of the two landing sites, Chryse Planitia and UTOPIA PLANITIA , which are both plains areas. They recorded dune-like features and a reddish dusty surface crowded with dark rocky blocks. Many of the blocks were v esicular and appeared similar in aspect to terrestrial basaltic rocks. Chemical analyses carried out on the sur- face revealed that the soil was probably the result of we a thering and oxidation of basaltic rocks. Pulverization by meteorite impacts has created fine micrometre-sized dusty particles. The deep reddish coloration is due to the presence of iron (III) oxide. Mars Pathfinder’s landing site in ARES VALLIS looked broadly similar. Its Sojourner robot v ehicle showed by X-ray spectrometry that the boulders w ere of various types, some similar to terrestrial basalt and andesite, and others apparently of a sedimentary nature. These findings implied that the rocks had been transport- ed from geologically different places, underscoring the long-range impression from orbital imagery that the region is an ancient flood-plain. The Thermal Emission Spectrometer aboard Mars Global Surveyor indicated the presence of the iron-containing minerals haematite and olivine in the basaltic bedrock areas observable in Mars’ southern hemisphere. The Vikings found the Martian soil to be sterile, bereft of organic matter, though long exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation would have destroyed any evidence of such matter in time. The so-called ‘microfossils’ described in a Martian meteorite ( ALLAN HILLS 84001) in 1996 are now thought by a consensus of scientists to be simply crystals of inorganic origin, rather than past Martian life-forms. This meteorite was blasted from the surface of Mars by a nearby impact over 16 million years ago and later picked up in Antarctica. In addition to the volcanic shields and the surrounding lightly cratered plains, the heavily cratered terrain of the southern hemisphere and the polar caps, there are exten- sive regions adjacent to the poles that have been dissected to reveal strongly laminated deposits. Such lamination points to a geological history of alternating warmer and colder climates. This can be explained by the fact that the inclination of the Martian axis is known to oscillate from 14º.9 to 35º.5, and the planet’s orbital eccentricity is known to vary from 0.004 to 0.141 over tens of thou- sands of years. The polar caps are believed to represent the visible summits of more extensive subsurface permafrost. Each consists of a permanent cap perhaps several kilometres thick (water ice in the north, a mixture of water and car- bon dioxide in the south) and an overlying seasonal cap of carbon dioxide. The seasonal caps undergo cyclic changes, occupying a diameter of over 60º in latitude in 247 M Name Latitude Longitude Comments ACIDALIA PLANITIA 47º.0N 22º.0W large low-albedo area ALBA PATERA 40º.5N 109º.9W low-profile shield volcano Antoniadi 21º.5N 299º.2W large crater, diameter 381 km (237 mi) ARES VALLIS 9º.7N 23º.4W flood-plain valley, landing site of Mars Pathfinder ARGYRE PLANITIA 50º.0S 44º.0W impact basin ARSIA MONS 8º.4S 121º.1W shield volcano ASCRAEUS MONS 11º.9N 104º.5W shield volcano Cassini 23º.8N 328º.2W large crater, diameter 415 km (258 mi) Chasma Boreale 83º.0N 45º.0W rift in north polar cap CHRYSE PLANITIA 27º.0N 40º.0W plains region, Viking 1 landing site Cimmeria Terra 35º.0S 215º.0W low-albedo feature Deuteronilus Mensae 45º.7N 337º.9W Martian mesae area ELYSIUM FOSSAE 24º.8N 213º.7W aligned valleys flanking Elysium Mons Elysium Mons 25º.0N 213º.1W volcano Ganges Catena 2º.8S 68º.7W crater chain Hadriaca Patera 32º.4S 268º.2W one of the oldest recognisable Martian volcanic structures Hecates Tholus 32º.7N 209º.8W shield volcano HELLAS PLANITIA 43º.0S 290º.0W largest Martian basin Huygens 14º.3S 304º.6W large crater, diameter 456 km (283 mi) Isidis Planitia 13º.0N 273º.0W low elevation plain Ismenia Fossa 38º.9N 326º.1W long shallow depression Ius Chasma 7º.0S 85º.8W canyon in western part of Valles Marineris KASEI VALLES 24º.6N 65º.0W major outflow channel area Lunae Planum 10º.0N 67º.0W plain Margaritifer Terra 5º.0S 25º.0W region of chaotic terrain Noctus Labyrinthus 7º.0S 102º.2W maze of intersecting canyons Ogygis Rupes 34º.1S 54º.9W ridge OLYMPUS MONS 18º.6N 134º.0W giant shield volcano Ophir Chasma 4º.0S 84º.7W part of central Valles Marineris canyon system PA VONIS MONS 0º.8N 113º.4W large shield volcano PROTONILUS MENSAE 44º.2N 309º.4W Martian mesae area Sabaea Terra 2º.0N 318º.0W low-albedo feature Sirenum Terra 40º.0S 150º.0W low-albedo feature SOLIS PLANUM 25º.5S 86º.5W low-albedo feature SYRTIS MAJOR PLANITIA 9º.5N 290º.5W plateau and low-albedo feature T empe Terra 40º.0N 71º.0W desert area THARSIS MONTES 1º.2N 112º.5W Mars’ main volcanic region T ithoniae Catena 5º.4S 82º.4W crater chain T yrrhena Terra 15º.0S 270º.0W low-albedo feature UTOPIA PLANITIA 50º.0N 242º.0W plain, Viking 2 landing site V ALLES MARINERIS 13º.9S 59º.2W great canyon system V ASTITAS BOREALIS 68ºN Northern circumpolar plain SELECTED MARTIAN FEATURES \u0001 Mars The existence of water on Mars, whether as subsurface liquid or as ice, is vital for the question of whether there was, or is, life on Mars.

It is estimated that the complete melting of the polar caps, which would only be possible given an adequate atmos- pheric pressure, would cover the planet with 10 metres of wa ter – sufficient for the supposed rivers and larger bodies of water of Mars’ geological past. Mars-crossing asteroid Any of a group of ASTEROIDS with orbits that cross some part of the orbit of Mars. In general this implies a perihelion distance of less than about 1.67 AU, although some NEAR - EARTH ASTEROIDS may be disqualified from this group because their aphelia lie within Mars’ perihelion distance of 1.38 AU. Asteroids with perihelia less than 1.30 AU are classed as AMOR ASTEROIDS , unless they actually cross the Earth’s orbit, in which case they are either APOLLO ASTEROIDS or A TEN ASTEROIDS . Mars Exploration Rover NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) mission, originally known as Mars 2003, to land two roving vehicles on Mars. Although it is possible that NASA will be forced to reduce the mission to one rover, the plan in 2001 involved two launches in 2003 June, with landings in 2004 January and February, using an inflatable airbag method used successfully for MARS PATHFINDER in 1997. The craft could bounce a dozen times and could roll as far as 1 km (0.6 mi). The bags will deflate and retract and petals will open up, bringing the lander to an upright position and revealing the rover. The landings will be made in two separate locations to be identified using MARS GLOBAL SURVEYOR images. The criteria will be that the sites reveal clear evidence of surface water, such as lakebeds or h ydrothermal deposits. The identical rovers will carry a suite of instruments, including three spectrometers and a microscopic imager, to search for evidence of liquid water that may have been present in the planet’s past. The rocks and soil will be collected by a sampler, while a rock abrasion tool will expose fresh rock surfaces for study. The 1500-kg rovers will be equipped with a 360º panoramic camera, giving three times the resolution of that carried on the Mars Pathfinder. This will be used to enable scientists to select samples. The rovers will be able to travel about 100 m (330 ft) a day with an operational lifetime expected to last 90 Martian days. Mars Express EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY (ESA) mission to be launched in 2003 June and to enter orbit around Mars in 2003 December. Mars Express was originally envisaged as part of a wider international effort to return samples of Mars to Earth in 2004 and 2006. The craft was to help track the US ascent vehicles. Such missions are unlikely to take place until the 2010 timeframe. Nonetheless, Mars Express will carry the UK’s BEAGLE 2 Mars lander – a late addition to the craft – and will be equipped with a suite of seven instruments to study the surface and atmosphere in detail, including a 10-m (33-ft) resolution photo-geology imager and a spectrometer with a resolution of 100 m (330 ft) to map the mineralogy of the planet. The spacecraft will operate in a polar orbit and will complement the new US MARS EXPLORATION ROVER and MARS ODYSSEY missions. Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) One of the USA’s most successful Mars probes. It was launched in 1996 November and entered orbit around Mars in 1997 September. The spacecraft was still operating in 2001 for special observations after its primary mission had ended. The MGS took over 300,000 high-resolution images of the Martian surface, including those that revealed what seemed to be clear evidence that at one time liquid water flowed across the surface. MGS was equipped with five of the seven instruments that flew on the Mars Observer, which failed to orbit the planet in 1993, probably because of an engine explosion. The images returned by the MGS – and the MARS PATHFINDER , which landed in 1997 – freely and widely available on the Internet, represented a new era in wide public access to and personal involvement with the exploration of space. Mars Odyssey NASA’s 2001 Mars Odyssey is the former Mars Surveyor 2001 craft renamed in honour of the English writer Arthur C. Clarke. Launched in 2001 April, Mars Odyssey entered an initial orbit around Mars in 2001 October and for the following 76 days used aerobraking in the upper atmosphere to manoeuvre into its operational orbit. Mars Odyssey is equipped with a thermal emission imager, a gamma-ray spectrometer and a radiation environmental experiment. The spectrometer is identical to the instrument lost when the Mars Observer mission failed in 1993. Mars Pathfinder First of NASA’s ‘faster-cheaper- better’ Discovery-class missions, mainly designed as a technology demonstration. It was launched on 1996 December 4 and arrived at Mars on 1997 July 4. Airbags w ere used to cushion the landing. The spacecraft impacted the surface at a velocity of about 18 m/s (60 ft/s) and bounced about 15 m (50 ft) into the air. After bouncing another 15 times it eventually came to rest about 1 km (0.6 mi) from the initial impact site. The landing took place on an ancient flood plain in the Ares Vallis region. Tw o days later, a small rover known as Sojourner rolled down a ramp on to the rocky surface. The 10-kg Mars-crossing asteroid 248 M 64-2065 \u0001 Mars Because Mars takes longer to orbit the Sun than Earth, the mean period between oppositions (the closest approach) is more than two years. With the Earth at E1 and Mars at M1, Mars is in opposition. A year later the Earth has come back to E1, but Mars has only reached M2. The next opposition occurs only after 780 days when Earth has caught up with Mars, with the Earth at E2 and Mars at M3. \u0001 Mars The Martian satellites Phobos and Deimos are thought to be captured asteroids. They orbit close to the planet’s surface – Phobos at 9378 km (5827 mi) and Deimos at 23,459 km (14,577 mi) – in almost circular orbits.

Panoramic views showed a landscape of broad, gentle ridges overlain with numerous dark-grey rocks of va r ious shapes and sizes. Close-up images of the rocks revealed pitted, layered and smooth surfaces. It was sug- gested that some of the rocks were conglomerates – sedi- mentary rocks that had formed when liquid water existed on the planet’s surface. By the time rover operations ceased on 1997 Septem- ber 27, Sojourner had travelled about 100 m (330 ft), car- r ied out 16 chemical analyses of rocks and soil and taken 550 images. The lander, which was renamed the Sagan Memorial Station in honour of planetary scientist Carl SAGAN , relayed an unprecedented 2.3 gigabits of data, including 16,500 lander images and 8.5 million measure- ments of atmospheric pressure, temperature and wind. Mars sample return missions Attempts to return samples of Mars to the Earth to help answer finally the questions about possible life on Mars. The first sample return mission was to have been made by a Mars Surveyor mission in 2005. The Mars Surveyor class lander would collect a modest 2 kg of samples and place them into a small ascent capsule, which would be fired off the surface and on a course to Earth. The failures of the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Landing missions in 1999 were a milestone in Martian exploration, resulting in major re-evaluation of future plans and the realization that such a mission is unlikely to take place until the 2010 timeframe. The high cost and level of technology required for a mission are major stumbling blocks in times of low b udgets, cut-price spacecraft and the technological disasters of losing two craft in a matter of months. Mars-Trojan asteroid ASTEROID that has the same orbital period as Mars, positioned around one of its LAGRANGIAN POINTS ,L 4 or L 5 . By late 2001 there were five Mars Trojans known, all of which are associated with L 5 . See also EUREKA ; TROJAN ASTEROID Martian canals See CANALS , MARTIAN Martian meteorite METEORITE that originated on Mars. Martian meteorites are also known as the SNCs, after the type specimens of the three original subgroups ( SHERGOTTY , NAKHLA and CHASSIGNY ). The collection of additional Martian meteorites from Antarctica and the Sahara Desert has extended the number of subgroups to five. The different subgroups are igneous rocks that formed in different locations at, or below, the Martian surface. The groups have different mineralogies and chemistries, and cannot all have come from a single impact event. At least three craters, with minimum diameters of c .12 km ( c .7 mi), are required to produce the variety of Martian meteorite types. As of summer 2001, there are 18 separate meteorites that almost certainly originated on Mars. The Martian origin rests on the age, composition and noble gas inventory of the meteorites. mascon (mass concentration) Concentration of mass below the Moon’s surface. Gravity mapping of the Moon has revealed mascons over many of the lunar basins, including IMBRIUM , SERENITATIS and NECTARIS . The gravity field over a planet is never completely even. Places of large mass concentrations exist, which are usual- ly due to accumulation of either heavy materials (for example high-density minerals) or the piling up of materi- als (such as mountains). Planetary bodies usually even out these mass concentrations through redistribution of mass, in order to achieve isostatic equilibrium. On the Moon, this occurs through movement (plastic flow) of the asthenosphere, which underlies the rigid lithosphere. Lunar mascons are always associated with basins, the largest impact structures on the Moon. As enormous amounts of surface material were removed by the crater- ing process, the asthenosphere moved towards the surface to replace the mass loss and to maintain isostatic equilibri- um. At a later time, lavas, which are much denser than crustal rock, poured into and filled the basins to depths of 2–4 km (1.2–2.5 mi). These two processes together formed the large mass concentrations. Early in the Moon’s history, the lithosphere was rela- tively thin, and mass concentrations were mostly smoothed out. Later, however, the lithosphere thickened because of continued cooling, so that new mass concen- trations were maintained. 249 M \u0001 Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) The Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) on the MGS confirmed there is a marked difference between the northern and southern halves of the planet.This false-colour image shows that the north consists mainly of low-lying ground (blue) and the south of highlands (green, yellow, red and white). The volcanoes of the Tharsis region are clearly visible, as is the deep Hellas Planitia impact basin. \u0002 Mars Pathfinder The Sojourner rover was deployed two days after Pathfinder landed on Mars. It spent 12 highly successful weeks examining a variety of rocks strewn across the flood plain of Ares Vallis.

A maser can be created in an astronomical source when one energy level of a molecule is preferentially populated by the radiation environment, and the molecule cools by stimulated emission. Water (H 2 O), the hydroxyl radical (OH), silicon monoxide (SiO) and several other molecules can produce maser emission in galactic and extragalactic objects. The name ‘maser’ is also used for the astronomical object itself. Since the molecular emission is amplified, the objects are easier to detect, and over 10,000 are known in the Galaxy. Masers occur in places where new stars are forming, and in the atmospheres of evolved stars, or variable stars with high mass loss which are in the process of becoming planetary nebulae or supernovae. Some of the first masers to be discovered w ere the OH–IR stars, which radiate in the 1612 MHz line ( see OH ). A star will have many masers in its envelope, and they can be tracked using MULTI - ELEMENT RADIO - LINKED INTERFEROMETER NETWORK or VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY , showing that the conditions in the envelope change over months and years. OH, CH and H 2 O megamasers have been found in galaxies such as the Large Magellanic Cloud, infrared luminous galaxies, active galaxies, starburst and Seyfert galaxies. Maskelyne, Nevil (1732–1811) English astronomer and clergyman, the fifth and longest-serving ASTRONOMER ROYAL (1765–1811). After studying mathematics at Cambridge University, he became James Bradley’s assistant at GREENWICH OBSERVATORY . In 1761 he took part in a Royal Society expedition to the island of St Helena to observe a transit of Venus. The voyage inspired him to apply astronomy to navigational problems, and in his British Mariner’s Guide (1763) he explained how to determine longitude at sea by comparing the Moon’s position as observed aboard ship to its position as observed from a known terrestrial longitude. He travelled to Barbados in 1764 to test John Harrison’s newly invented MARINE CHRONOMETER , which proved to be more practical and accurate than the lunar method of finding longitude. Two years later Maskelyne founded the NAUTICAL ALMANAC . In 1774 he measured the deflection of a large pendulum erected a top the Scottish mountain of Schiehallion; from the deflection he calculated the mountain’s mass and thence the gravitational constant and the Earth’s density. His v alue of 4.87 times the density of water is close to the accepted modern value of 5.52. mass Measure of an object’s INERTIA . The mass defined in this way is called the inertial mass. Mass may also be defined from the GRAVITATIONAL FORCE that it produces, leading to the gravitational mass. Experiments have shown that the two masses are identical to better than one part in 10 12 . This has led to the principle of equivalence ‘no experiment can distinguish between the effects of a gr a vitational force and those of an inertial force in an accelerated frame’, which underlies EINSTEIN ’ S theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY . massive compact halo object (MACHO) Dark object, perhaps a BROWN DWARF or BLACK HOLE , postulated to explain the missing mass seen in galactic rotation curves. mass–luminosity relation F or stars on the MAIN SEQUENCE there exists a one-to-one relationship between luminosity and mass, expressed approximately as L \u0001 M x . This relation enables mass to be determined from absolute magnitude. The exponent x va r ies with mass, being 1.6 for stars of around 100 solar masses, 3.1 for stars of around 10 solar masses, 4.7 for stars of a solar mass and 2.7 for low-mass stars of around a tenth of a solar mass. These differences are due primarily to the opacity of the stars caused by their different interior temperatures. mass transfer Process that occurs in CLOSE BINARY stars when one star fills its R OCHE LOBE and material transfers to the other star through the inner LAGRANGIAN POINT . Material can be transferred directly to the other star but is more usually transferred via an A CCRETION DISK . The material flowing through the inner Lagrangian point moves very like a free particle, but when the mater- ial impacts the accretion disk around the other star, it stops moving like a free particle, since gas cannot flow freely through other gas, and the energy is dissipated via shock waves. The observed period of the outbursts from the shock wa v es gives information about the time it takes material to spiral from the secondary on to the accreting primary. For dwarf novae, the time is typically a few days. These obser- va tions suggest that material accretes a lot faster than should be allowed by the natural viscosity of gas. If it is to accrete on to the primary, the material must first lose its original ANGULAR MOMENTUM . It may be that the gas in an accretion disk behaves like a fluid with a very high vis- cosity, with the viscosity slowing the motion of the gas. Masursky MAIN - BELT ASTEROID ; number 2685. It was imaged in 2000 January with the camera on board the Saturn-bound CASSINI space probe. Masursky is c .15 km ( c .9 mi) in size. Masursky, Harold (1922–90) American geologist and planetary scientist who played a major role in most of NASA’s 1960s–1980s missions to explore the Solar System. He designed the scientific experiments and helped select the landing sites for the RANGER 8 and 9 lunar probes, helped to coordinate the LUNAR ORBITER programme, was responsible for the APOLLO 8 and 10 geochemical investigations, and coordinated the geological experiments carried out by Apollos 14–16.

Mauna Kea Observatory W orld’s largest astronomical observatory. It is situated at the 4205-m (13,796-ft) sum- mit of Mauna Kea (which means ‘White Mountain’), a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii and the highest point in the Pacific Basin. It is above 40% of the Earth’s a tmosphere and 97% of the water vapour in the atmos- phere, resulting in very high atmospheric transparency and freedom from cloud. Laminar airflow over the moun- tain produces superb image quality. The observatory, operated by the University of Hawaii, hosts nine telescopes for optical and infrared astronomy and two for submillimetre astronomy. They include the largest single-mirror optical/infrared telescopes in the w orld, the twin reflectors of the W . M . KECK OBSERVATORY ; and the largest submillimetre telescope in the world, the JAMES CLERK MAXWELL TELESCOPE . Also on Mauna Kea is the CALTECH SUBMILLIMETER OBSERVATORY , while a third submillimetre instrument (the SUBMILLIMETER ARRAY ) is under construction. The westernmost antenna of the VERY LONG BASELINE ARRAY is nearby. Astronomy on Mauna Kea began in the 1960s, when the University of Hawaii placed a 0.6-m (24-in.) tele- scope there, followed in 1970 by their 2.2-m (88-in.) reflector. Three more telescopes were built on the site in 1979: the 3.2-m (126-in.) NASA Infrared Telescope F acility (IRTF), the 3.6-m (142-in.) CANADA – FRANCE – HAWAII TELESCOPE and the 3.8-m (150-in.) UNITED KINGDOM INFRARED TELESCOPE . Mauna Kea’s exceptional observing conditions attracted four 8–10 metre class telescopes in the 1990s: the two Keck Telescopes, the Japanese SUBARU TELESCOPE , and the northern telescope of the GEMINI OBSERVATORY . Fur- ther development of the site is likely. Astronomers and technicians working on Mauna Kea must first acclimatize to the altitude. A mid-level facility at Hale Pohaku, at an altitude of 2800 m (9300 ft), provides accommodation and other facilities; it is named the Ellison Onizuka Center for International Astronomy to honour Hawaiian astronaut Ellison Shoji Onizuka (1946–86), who died in the Challenger disaster. Maunder, (Edward) Walter (1851–1928) British solar astronomer and a founder of the BRITISH ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION (BAA). He was appointed Photographic and Spectroscopic Assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in 1873, where he used various instruments to observe sunspots, faculae and prominences. Over the next thirty years, he compiled the most complete record of sunspot activity, supplementing the Greenwich data with observations from overseas. By plotting the mean heliographic latitude of sunspot groups against time, Maunder created the first BUTTERFLY DIAGRAM and determined that the Sun showed DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION . He also researched historical sunspot records, discovering the paucity of sunspot activity during the years 1615–1745 now known as the MAUNDER MINIMUM . Maunder organized and participated in many expedi- tions to observe total solar eclipses, on which he was often accompanied by his second wife, Annie Scott Dill Maunder (1858–1947), who also worked as an astronomer at Greenwich. Annie Maunder took fine pho- tographs during these eclipses – on one image the corona could be traced to a distance from the limb of six solar radii. The Maunders were instrumental in the formation of the BAA (1890), which soon became the world’s fore- most group of amateur astronomers. Maunder minimum Pe r iod between 1645 and 1715 when very few SUNSPOTS w ere observed. It has been named after Walter MAUNDER who in 1922 provided a full account of the 70-year dearth in sunspots, first noticed by Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm SPÖRER in 1887–89. The scarcity of sunspots during this period has been substantiated by other indicators of low solar activity, such as the amount of radioactive carbon-14 in old tree rings and the occurrence of low-latitude aurorae. The Maunder minimum coincided with years of sustained low temperatures in Europe, from about AD 1400 to 1800, known as the Little Ice Age.

Maurolycus lies over several older craters, the rims of which are visible to the south-west and north-west. At high Sun angles, the bright ray system of TYCHO can be seen on Maurolycus’ floor. Maury, Antonia Caetana (1866–1952) Pioneer American woman astronomer at the HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY . Maury, a niece of Henry Draper, helped to compile the HENRY DRAPER CATALOGUE , named as a memorial to him. This work, carried out at Harvard from 1887 under the direction of Edward C. PICKERING , required Maury to examine and classify thousands of stellar spectra, in the course of which she refined the classification system to account for the sharpness of spectral lines. In 1905 Ejnar HERTZSPRUNG showed that Maury’s modification could be used to distinguish between giant and dwarf stars. Maury also became expert at identifying spectroscopic binaries, helping Pickering to prove the true nature of the first star to be identified as such, Mizar ( \u0001 Ursae Majoris), and in 1889 calculated its 104-day period.

Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie (MPIfR) Institute located in Bonn, Germany, with the primary pur- pose of operating the fully steerable 100-m (330-ft) tele- scope at Bad Münstereifel-Effelsberg, 40 km (25 mi) south-west of the city. The Effelsberg Radio Telescope is a lightweight paraboloidal dish commissioned in 1972, and it is used at centimetre wavelengths both as a stand-alone instrument and as an element of global VERY LONG BASE - LINE INTERFEROMETRY experiments. The MPIfR collabo- rated with the STEWARD OBSERVATORY to build the 10-m (33-ft) HEINRICH HERTZ TELESCOPE for submillimetre- wa v elength observations. Maxwell, James Clerk (1831–79) Scottish physicist who unified the forces of electricity and magnetism and showed that light is a form of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION . In 1859 he demonstrated mathematically that Saturn’s rings could not be stable if they were completely solid or liquid, and most likely consisted of small solid, particles – as was proved by James KEELER in 1895. Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution Law determining the speed of particles in a gas. It takes the form: where N ( v ) is the number density of particles with v elocities in the range v to v + dv , N is the total number density of the particles, m is the particle mass, T the temperature and k is BOLTZMANN ’ S CONSTANT . It gives a bell-shaped distribution, the peak of which moves to higher velocities as the temperature increases. The onset of degeneracy ( see DEGENERATE MATTER ) in, for example, WHITE DWARFS is indicated by deviations of particle speeds from the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. Mayer, (Johann) Tobias (1723–62) German mathematician, astronomer and cartographer who produced precise tables of lunar positions, taking into account lunar libration, that were used by later astronomers to reckon longitude at sea. He produced the first map of the Moon based upon micrometer measurements (1750). From his observations he concluded that the Moon has no appreciable atmosphere. In 1753 Mayer began publishing his lunar tables, and he developed a mathematical method of estimating longitude to within half a degree. He also derived an improved method for calculating solar eclipses. Mayall Telescope See KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY Mayan astronomy See NATIVE AMERICAN ASTRONOMY mean anomaly See ANOMALY mean solar time Local time based on a fictitious, or mean, Sun which is defined as moving around the celestial equator at a constant speed equal to the average rate of motion of the true Sun along the ecliptic. Because the true Sun does not appear to move across the sky at a uniform rate, the length of the solar day as measured by APPARENT SOLAR TIME va r ies throughout the year by up to 16 minutes. For the purposes of establishing a uniform civil time, it was therefore necessary to invent a MEAN SUN . The difference between apparent solar time and mean solar time is the EQUATION OF TIME . mean Sun Fictitious Sun conceived to provide a uniform measure of time equal to the average APPARENT SOLAR TIME . The mean Sun is deemed to take the same time as the real Sun to complete one annual revolution of the celestial sphere, relative to the FIRST POINT OF ARIES , b ut it moves along the celestial equator at a constant speed equal to the average rate of motion of the true Sun along the ecliptic. See also MEAN SOLAR TIME . Méchain, Pierre François André (1744–1805) French astronomer at France’s Marine Observatory, best known as a colleague of Charles MESSIER who contributed to the famous MESSIER CATALOGUE of ‘nebulae’, and for his own observations of comets. He discovered ten comets between 1781 and 1799, often computing their orbits himself. One of these discoveries (1786) was the famous Comet ENCKE . Like Messier, Méchain began cataloguing celestial objects that appeared ‘nebulous’ in order to avoid misidentifying them as new comets. He discovered 21 of the nebulous objects that Messier included in his final list published in 1781, and with Messier discovered the six objects added in the 20th century as M104–109. medieval European astronomy Astronomy as prac- tised in Western Europe between about AD 400 and 1500. Modern scholarship is fundamentally changing the belief that no serious astronomy took place in Europe in this period. But medieval astronomy differs from that of later ages in its attitude to new knowledge.

Preservation rather than progress was the aim, yet much useful observation and invention came from them. Between the end of the Roman world in the 5th century AD and the 12th century, only fragments of PTOLEMY , ARISTOTLE and other Greek scientific writers w ere available in the West. Astronomy was learned from encyclopedic digests, such as those by Pliny the Elder ( AD 23–79) and Boethius ( c. 480–524). Nonetheless, the basic structures of the classical cosmos were familiar to all educated people. The Earth was not flat, but a sphere, set motionless at the centre of a series of ‘crystalline’ spheres that carried the Moon, Sun, planets and stars, and rotated around us at different speeds; the Moon’s sphere in 28 days, Saturn’s in 29 years. The stars were all the same distance away, and were gathered into Ptolemy’s 48 constellations, including the 12 zodiacal signs. One of the main reasons for the cultivation of astronomy in medieval Europe was the refinement of the calendar, and in particular, the accurate determination of the date of Easter, the most sacred of Christian festivals, which was calculated from a formula governed by the ‘Paschal’ or full moon following the vernal equinox. ‘The V enerable’ BEDE became Britain’s first astronomer when he developed superior techniques for calculating Easter. Throughout the medieval period, the requirements of the calendar, and, to a lesser extent, of observing the daily motions of the stars to determine the times for monastic prayers, kept astronomy and the Church closely wedded. Not until 1582, by which time astronomers had sufficient data on calendrical errors, and established the Earth’s rotation period to within seconds of the modern value, could they refine calendrical calculations to produce the GREGORIAN CALENDAR we still use today. It was only after the mid-12th century that astronomy came to be extensively cultivated in Europe, partly as a result of contacts with ISLAMIC ASTRONOMY in Spain and P alestine. The Arabs had already translated Ptolemy, Aristotle and other writers into Arabic. These works, in turn, came to be translated into Latin, so that for the first time European scholars had access to complete versions of the leading classical texts. They also acquired Latin translations of the original researches of various Arab astronomers. Europeans, such as the Frenchman Gerbert of Aurillac ( c. 940–1003), visited Muslim Spain, and it is Gerbert who is credited with introducing the ASTROLABE into Europe. The large number of astronomical books being translated into Latin gave astronomy an assured place in the curricula of Bologna, Paris, Oxford, and the other emerging universities of the 12th century. In the quadrivium, students were instructed in astronomy, geometry, arithmetic and music: the four ‘sciences’ of mathematical proportion. Johannes de Sacrobosco (d. c .1256) wrote the best-selling De sphaera mundi (‘On the Sphere of the World’) around 1240, which would be a reference for students of astronomy for the next 400 y ears. Through the universities especially, astronomical knowledge became widespread in educated society. The poet Geoffrey Chaucer ( c .1340–1400) wrote T reatise on the Astrolabe ( c .1381), the first technological book in the English language, being a practical manual describing the use of the astrolabe. One of the most adventurous branches of medieval astronomical thought was cosmology. While celestial mechanics was explained in terms of Aristotle’s spheres and Ptolemy’s epicycles, several theologian-astronomers had some remarkably modern-sounding ideas about time and space. Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Bradwardine ( c .1290–1349), Bishops Jean Buridan ( c .1295– c .1358), Nicole de Oresme ( c .1323–82) and Nicholas of Cusa (1401–64), and others asked such questions as, could time have existed before God created the Universe? Could there be such a thing as an INFINITE UNIVERSE ? And was motion relative? Space, time and infinity fascinated medieval scholars. No one w as burnt at the stake for asking such questions, for the academic clergy saw them as lying within the legitimate bounds of university discussion. Apart from an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to ban aspects of Aristotelian science in Paris in 1277, the medieval Church had no specific policies on astronomy, and w ould not have until the 17th century. From the sheer number of manuscripts and, after 1460, printed astronomical books, astrolabes, dials and artefacts in libraries and museum collections, it is clear that astronomy had a high profile in medieval European culture. It was essential to Church administration, it was a major component of the university curriculum and it even penetrated vernacular literature. It was also suspicious of astrology. Where it differed essentially from the astronomy of the scientific revolution, however, was in its conservative, as opposed to the latter’s progressive, approach. Without an already established astronomical culture, the developments of RENAISSANCE ASTRONOMY could not have taken place. Megrez The star \u0001 Ursae Majoris, visual mag. 3.32, dis- tance 81 l.y., spectral type A2 V.

MEM Abbreviation of MAXIMUM ENTROPY METHOD meniscus lens Thin LENS usually having one convex and one concave surface and resembling the shape of the meniscus at the surface of a liquid such as water. Common examples are contact lenses. In astronomy, meniscus lenses are used to improve image quality in reflecting telescopes. Examples are the corrector plate in SCHMIDT – CASSEGRAIN , Maksutov–Cassegrain and Maksutov–Newtonian telescopes. In all of these, a large meniscus lens with little optical power is mounted at the entrance to the optical tube; it is often referred to as the corrector plate. As the light enters the telescope its path is altered slightly by the meniscus lens so that it hits the main mirror at the optimum angle for forming sharp images right across the whole field of view. In the Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope the meniscus lens appears to be a flat plate, although it has a mild aspheric shape to one surface. In the MAKSUTOV TELESCOPE the meniscus lens is steeply curved. Menkalinan The star \u0002 Aurigae, visual mag. 1.90, dis- tance 82 l.y., spectral type A1 IV. It is an eclipsing binary of period 3.96 days, undergoing two minima of 0.1 mag. in each orbital cycle. Its name comes from the Arabic mankib dhi al-’ina ̄n , meaning ‘shoulder of the charioteer’. Menkar The star \u0003 Ceti, visual mag. 2.54, distance 220 l.y., spectral type M2 III.

Menzel and his predecessor at Harvard, Henry Norris R USSELL , strongly influenced the course of American astrophysics. At Lick Observatory (1924–32), Menzel analysed flash spectra of the Sun obtained by William CAMPBELL , developing quantitative spectroscopy in the process. He used the new quantum physics to interpret stellar absorption and emission lines, and derived the abun- dances of the chemical elements in the solar chromos- phere, paying close attention to the lines of neutral and ionized helium observable in the upper chromosphere and in prominences. Menzel’s findings that these lines originated at temperatures greater than 20,000 K, together with his discovery of more ionized hydrogen than had been expected, proved that the chromosphere w as a distinct layer of the Sun and not an extension of the photosphere, as had been thought. Menzel applied his knowledge of astrophysics to the nature of diffuse nebulae. In the mid-1930s he devel- oped the quantitative analysis of the spectra of nebulae, culminating in the publication of Physical Processes in Gaseous Nebulae . He refined the theory of RADIATIVE TRANSFER and made important studies of the late stages of stellar evolution and associated phenomena, including planetary nebulae around white dwarf stars. He derived a formula for calculating the temperature of a planetary nebula’s central star. During his directorship of Harvard College Observa- tory, Menzel engineered the transfer of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to Cambridge, Massachu- setts, where it became the HARVARD – SMITHSONIAN CEN - TER FOR ASTROPHYSICS . He was involved with the founding of many observatories, including the High Alti- tude Observatory at Climax, Colorado, the solar obser- va tory at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico, the NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY and KITT PEAK NATIONAL OBSERVATORY .

The first flights, by modified Redstone boosters, were suborbital. On Mercury-Redstone 3, Alan SHEPARD became the first US astronaut to fly in space (1961 May 5). The capsule reached an altitude of 186 km (116 mi) and landed 478 km (297 mi) downrange. After a repeat suborbital flight by Virgil Grissom (1926–67), four orbital missions w ere flown using Atlas D boosters. On 1962 February 20, John GLENN became the first American to orbit the planet, completing three Earth revolutions in 4 h 55 m 23 s . The last and longest Mercury mission was flown by Gordon Cooper (1927– ) on 1963 May 15–16. Mercury Innermost planet of the Solar System. Mercury is often described as the elusive planet, which is a miscon- ception. Mercury is, in fact, easily picked up with the naked eye around the time of its greatest elongation from the Sun, when it can be followed without optical help for several days. Admittedly the planet is difficult to observe telescopically, mainly because of its small angular size and its proximity to the Sun; indeed it can never be seen more than 28º from the Sun since its orbit is inside that of the Earth. Nevertheless bright and dusky markings are visible in moderate-sized telescopes and observers have synthe- sized their findings into a reasonably reliable albedo chart of named features. Mercury is the innermost and smallest of the Solar System’s major planets. It is also the densest. The unusu- al density to radius relationship is inferred to indicate an exceptionally large metallic core, which is thought to be about 1800 km (1100 mi) in radius, only some 600 km (370 mi) beneath the surface.

The evolution of the planet must, therefore, be strongly influenced by core formation, probably from what is believed to be highly refractory material. The magnetic field is approximately a dipole aligned along the axis of rotation and can probably be attributed to dynamo action in a presumed fluid core. Alternatively, if the core is actually solid, Mercury’s magnetic field may – uniquely among the terrestrial planets – be a remnant of magnetization of the crust that was acquired during the planet’s formation. Mercury orbits the Sun in 87.969 days and revolves about its axis in two-thirds of the orbital period, 58.646 days. The slow rotation ( see also VENUS ) may have come about through the retarding tidal action of the Sun. The two-thirds resonance requires the ‘trapping’ of Mercury in this state, and a non-hydrostatic bulge is inferred, prob- ably caused by convection in its MANTLE occurring by solid state creep. The lack of atmosphere, the intensity of solar radiation and the length of the planet’s day lead to immense temper- a ture contrasts. On the equator at perihelion the noonday temperature soars to 700 K. At night it plunges to 100 K. Although very little was known about Mercury prior to the three MARINER 10 encounters in 1974 and 1975, Earth-based photometric data did hint at a rough and uneven surface analogous to that of the Moon. Mariner 10 confirmed the supposition. It revealed an airless world, the surface of which, in the form of craters, bright ray sys- tems, ridges (dorsa), valleys (valles) and smooth lava plains (planitia), showed the imprint of a violent past. Craters are named after artists, authors and musicians; v alleys after prominent radio observatories; and the plani- tia after Mercury in various languages and after ancient gods with a role similar to the Roman god Mercury. The r upes or scarps commemorate ships associated with exploration and scientific research. Mariner 10 imaged only 35% of Mercury’s surface. Of this, 70% was found to be ancient, heavily cratered terrain. The most significant formation is the CALORIS PLANITIA , which is most likely the result of an impact by a body sim- ilar to those that formed the multi-ring basins (circular maria) on the Moon. Characteristic surface features found on the planet are long, sinuous cliffs or lobate scarps. These scarps are steep, with an average height of 1 km (0.6 mi), extending for hundreds of kilometres. They may have formed as the crust cooled and shrank. In places the scarps cut across craters, intercrater plains and smooth plains. No strike-slip faults are seen on Mercury and there is no evidence of plate tectonics. Compressional features are seen, however, which could be explained by a contraction caused by cooling since the planet’s forma- tion. Estimates of the contraction required are about one part in 1000 or 10,000 and would be consistent with tem- perature decreases of a few hundred degrees. Solidifica- tion of a once-fluid core would be very effective. Astonishingly, radar data indicate the possible exis- tence of small polar ice deposits. This is not as improbable as it seems. It is just one of the mysteries that await resolu- tion when the next planned space mission starts to probe the battered surface of our thin-shelled neighbour world. mercury–manganese star Chemically peculiar late B STAR that has greatly enhanced abundances of mercury, manganese and other elements, including rare earths.

Messenger NASA Discovery programme spacecraft that will resume exploration of the planet MERCURY in 2008 January, after an interval of 33 years since MARINER 10. Messenger, which will make an initial flyby of the planet, will later orbit around Mercury in 2009 September, marking a first in space exploration. The orbit will be 200 km (125 mi) by 15,190 km (9430 mi), with an inclination of 80º. The spacecraft, designed to monitor Mercury’s surface, space environment and geochemistry, as well as ranging, will study the surface composition, geological history, core, mantle, magnetic field and very tenuous atmosphere of the planet. It will search for possible water ice and other frozen volatiles at the poles over a nominal orbital mission of one year. The path of Messenger to Mercury will involve a gravity assist flyby of the Earth in 2005 August, and two Venus flybys in 2006 October and 2007 June. It will also make two flybys of Mercury, in 2008 January and October, prior to its orbital insertion in 2009. Messier, Charles Joseph (1730–1817) French astronomer known for his discoveries of comets and his compilation of the famous MESSIER CATALOGUE of deep- sky objects. Little is known of his life before 1751, when he was hired by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle (1688–1768) of Paris Observatory to record observations in his ‘neat, legible hand’. Delisle, who had found Messier a post at the observatory at the Hôtel de Cluny, calculated posi- tions for the 1758/9 return of Halley’s Comet, and instructed his assistant to search for it. Messier recovered the comet on 1759 January 21. Messier, inspired by his success with Halley’s Comet, searched for more. Between 1758 and 1801 he found about twenty comets (14 of which were sole discoveries), increasing his fame and status – in 1770 he was elected to the prestigious Paris Academy of Sciences, and was dubbed the ‘comet ferret’ by King Louis XV. But Messier’s lasting fame rests on the numbered list he compiled of fuzzy, permanent objects that might be mis- taken for comets. He had independently discovered the first two objects on this list, the Crab Nebula (M1) and a globular cluster in Aquarius (M2), in 1758 and 1760. His first sole discovery, the globular M3 in 1764, prompted him to make a systematic search, and by the end of that year he had observed and recorded objects up to M40. The list (up to M45) was first published in 1774, and longer versions appeared in 1780 (to M68) and 1781 (to M103). Today’s Messier Catalogue of 110 objects includes seven others known to have been observed by Messier. Messier Catalogue Listing of nebulae, star clusters and galaxies, numbering over 100, begun by Charles MESSIER . Messier drew up the list so that he and other comet- hunters would not confuse these permanent, fuzzy- looking objects with comets. The first edition of the catalogue was published in 1774, with supplements in 1780 and 1781. Not all the objects in the catalogue, known as Messier objects , were discovered by Messier himself; several were found by Pierre MÉCHAIN , and others added by later observers. Objects in the catalogue are given the prefix M, and are still widely known by their Messier numbers. The Messier objects ( see the accompanying table, page 258–59), includ- ing as they do many of the showpiece deep-sky objects vis- ible from northerly latitudes, make popular targets for amateur observers. An attempt to observe as many as pos- sible during the course of one night is known as a ‘Messier marathon’. See also CALDWELL CATALOGUE Messier numbers Numbers allocated to clusters, nebulae and galaxies listed by Charles Messier in his MESSIER CATALOGUE of comet-like objects. Me star MSTAR that has hydrogen EMISSION LINES in its spectrum; the ‘e’ is appended to the luminosity class. Me stars are found at all luminosities. Among the dwarfs (dMe stars), the emissions become more prevalent towards later (cooler) subtypes. PROXIMA CENTAURI (M5 Ve) is a good example. The emissions signify notable chromospheres, which in turn indicate strong magnetic dynamos. As a result, dMe stars can produce powerful solar-like flares involving much or even all of the star. FLARE STARS extend to the K dwarfs as well, and even into class L. Among the class M giants, hydrogen emission – caused by pulsation-generated shock waves – is seen in both oxy- gen-rich and carbon-star Mira variables; Mira itself (M7 IIIe), Chi Cygni (S6 IIIe) and R Leporis (Hind’s Crimson Star, C7 IIIe) are fine examples. In the most luminous class M supergiants (Mu Cephei M2 Iae, VV Cephei M2 Iaep), the emission is related to powerful enveloping winds; such stars are also IRREGULAR VARIABLES . metals Te rm used by astronomers to describe all elements heavier than helium. Thus the metal content of a star, denoted by Z , is the combined mass fraction of all elements heavier than helium. Mass fractions of hydrogen and helium are denoted by X and Y respectively; thus a meridian 256 M \u0001 Messier Catalogue M92 (NGC 6431) is a 6th-magnitude globular cluster in Hercules. It is visible in all but the smallest amateur instruments. M AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 6:48 pm Page 256"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"meteor typical star may have X = 0.75, Y = 0.24 and Z = 0.01. While the values of X and Y are relatively constant from one unevolved star to another, Z changes dramatically over a range approximately 10 \u0001 4 to 0.02. Indeed, stars are postulated (Population III stars) with Z =0 ( see POPULATIONS , STELLAR ). The relative abundances of the elements are usually quoted as a ratio to the amount of hydrogen, whose value is arbitrarily set at 12.0. The following are the figures for the solar abundances for the more common elements: H (12.00), He (10.93), O (8.82), C (8.52), N (7.96), Ne (7.92), Fe (7.60), Si (7.52), Mg (7.42) and S (7.20). These figures probably reflect the relative abundance of the heavy elements on a cosmic scale. The abundance of elements in a star is measured from the absorption lines in its SPECTRUM . For stars other than the Sun the abundances of the ele- ments are not generally so well known or easily measured. Thus Fe/H, the iron to hydrogen ratio, is often used to measure the ‘metallicity’ (total abundance of elements heavier than helium) of stars, it being assumed that the other heavy elements will be in the same proportion to iron as found in the Sun. Formally, Fe/H is log (NFe/NH)(star) \u0001 log (NFe/NH)(Sun). The reason for the large variation in metal content, Z , of stars is that the heavy elements are not primordial. Only hydrogen and helium (and very small quantities of lithi- um) are formed in the BIG BANG . All other elements are synthesized in the NUCLEAR REACTIONS that take place in the centres of stars. This processed material is eventually returned to the interstellar medium by stellar mass loss, of which the most dramatic example is the SUPERNOVA explo- sion. Thus the interstellar medium is continually being enriched with ‘metals’. It also follows that young stars that have recently formed from the interstellar medium will have large Z . Thus Population I stars, which are young, have large Z whereas Population II stars, which formed first and are now old, have low Z values. The cosmic lithi- um abundance is an important indicator of the nature of the early Universe. Unfortunately, there are many reasons why stellar lithium abundances will not accurately reflect primordial lithium abundances. The metallicity Z has important consequences for a star. The most important effect is that a larger value of Z gives rise to a greater opacity of the stellar gas. The increase in opacity is due to the many possible lines, free- bound transitions and free electrons produced by ionized and partially ionized heavier elements. This will radically affect the structure of a star at any stage and also its evolu- tion. Probably the most striking example of this is that Population II MAIN - SEQUENCE stars (low Z ) are both hot- ter and more luminous than Population I stars of the same mass. Thus the Population II main sequence lies leftwards of the Population I main sequence in the HERTZSPRUNG – RUSSELL DIAGRAM (HR diagram). Fur- thermore, Population II stars will spend a shorter time on the main sequence than their Population I counterparts. Thus a good knowledge of Z is essential for judging the age of star clusters from the main sequence. Likewise, Z must be well known if the main sequences of two clusters are to be compared for the purpose of measuring cluster distances. A similar effect occurs on the HORIZONTAL BRANCH in the HR diagram. Thus low metallicity RR LYRAE STARS are thought to be intrinsically brighter than high-metallicity RR Lyrae stars. The original metallicity of a star can also affect its structure and evolution by modifying the nuclear burning in its centre. The most obvious example of this is that the abundance of carbon and nitrogen will affect the CAR - BON – NITROGEN – OXYGEN CYCLE for hydrogen burning in massive main-sequence stars. Some stars have particular elements or groups of ele- ments that are relatively either over- or under-abundant. For example, AP STARS show over-abundances of man- ganese or europium, chromium and strontium. This is thought to be caused by some diffusion process which brings these elements up from the interior. Similarly AM STARS show a slight over-abundance of elements near iron and an under-abundance of calcium and scandium. Again, a diffusion mechanism is thought to operate. Amongst the cool giant stars, CARBON STARS (C stars) show carbon to oxygen ratio four times that of normal stars. SST ARS show an over-abundance of zirconium, yttrium, barium and even technetium, which has a half- life of only 2 \u0002 10 6 years ( see TECNETIUM STAR ). Some G and K giants also show over-abundance of barium, strontium and other elements produced by the SP ROCESS as well as over-abundant carbon. These stars are called BARIUM STARS . metastable state Relatively long-lived excited state ( see EXCITATION ) of an atom that has only forbidden transitions ( see FORBIDDEN LINES ) to lower levels. In the rarefied interstellar medium an electron can remain in such a state for its natural lifetime, but under terrestrial conditions atoms are very soon knocked out of metastable states by collisions. See also LASER ; TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE LINE meteor Brief streak of light seen in a clear night sky when a small particle of interplanetary dust, a METEOROID , burns itself out in Earth’s upper atmosphere. As the meteoroid collides with atoms and molecules of air, a large quantity of heat energy is produced, which usually vaporizes the particle completely by a process of ABLATION . Vaporized atoms from the ablating meteoroid make further collisions, causing first excitation, then ionization as electrons are stripped from air atoms and molecules. An ablating meteoroid thus leaves behind it a trail of highly excited atoms, which then de-excite to produce the streak of light seen as a meteor. Ionization produces a trail of ions and electrons which can scatter or reflect radio waves transmitted from ground-based equipment, causing a radio meteor. The trail of ionization is only a few metres wide, but may typically be 20–30 km (12–19 mi) long. Most meteors appear at altitudes between 80–110 km (50–70 mi), where the air density becomes sufficiently high for ablation to occur. The altitude of this meteor layer varies slightly over the sunspot cycle, being greater at times of high solar activity. A typical meteor reaches its maximum brightness at an altitude of 95 km (59 mi). Usually, a visual meteor will persist for between 0.1 and 0.8 seconds. Brighter meteors sometimes leave a faintly glowing TRAIN or wake after extinction, and may show bursts of brightening (flares) along their paths. Meteoroids enter the atmosphere at velocities between 11 and 72 km/s (7–45 mi/s). At the lower end of this range, the velocity is simply that of a particle in free fall hitting the Earth. The greatest value is obtained by sum- ming the maximum heliocentric velocity of the meteoroid at a distance from the Sun of 1 AU (42 km/s or 26 mi/s) with Earth’s mean orbital velocity of 30 km/s (19 mi/s). A typical naked-eye meteor around magnitude \u0003 2 is produced by ablation of a meteoroid 8 mm in diameter, and with a mass around 0.1 g. Over the whole Earth, 100 million meteors in the visual range down to magnitude \u0003 5 occur each day. 257 M \u0001 meteor Meteors sometimes leave a trail of ionized gas in the atmosphere as they burn up. This is known as a ‘train’, and may last for some minutes.

Meteor Crater (Arizona Crater, Barringer Crater) First crater to be recognized as being caused by METEORITE impact. It is situated on a flat plateau between Flagstaff and Winslow, Arizona, USA. The crater is a basin-shaped depression some 1200 m (3940 ft) in diameter. The walls surrounding the crater r ise 37–50 m (121–164 ft) above the surrounding plain. The outer slopes are quite gentle, but the inner slopes are steep, being as much as 80º in the southern sector. A whole 600-m (2000-ft) section of the pre-existing sedimentary rocks has been lifted about 30 m (100 ft) to form the south wall of the crater. The feature first created interest in 1891, when large quantities of meteoritic iron were discovered on the sur- rounding plain. In 1905 boreholes and shafts were sunk in the centre of the crater in an attempt to find the main mass of the meteorite. After passing through crushed sandstone and rock flour, undisturbed rocks were found at a depth of 185 m (607 ft). In 1920 attention was con- centrated on the southern rim without success. It is now known that at times of such impacts, the meteorite is either vaporized or shattered to extents that depend on Meteor Crater 258 M MESSIER CATALOGUE M NGC RA Dec.

Silica glass and very finely divided white sand (known as rock flour), together with forms of quartz known as coesite and stishovite, all point to the structure having been formed by meteoritic impact. Studies of the distribution of the meteoritic material around the crater have led to the conclusion that the meteoroid responsible for the crater was travelling from north-north-west to south-south-east. This is consistent with the evidence gained from studies of the tilt of the rock layers forming the rim. Many attempts have been made to ascertain the age of the crater.

For example, a brilliant fireball on 1890 June 25, at 1pm, was visible over a large area of the mid- w est of the United States; the CHONDRITE fall at Farming- ton, Kansas, was the result. If an object (a meteoroid) enters the atmosphere at a low angle, deceleration in the thin upper atmosphere may take tens of seconds. The fire- ball of 1969 April 25 travelled from south-east to north- w est and was visible along its 500 km (310 mi) trajectory from much of England, Wales and Ireland. As commonly occurs, towards the end of its path the fireball fragmented. Sonic booms were heard after its passage, and two mete- oritic stones were recovered, some 60 km (37 mi) apart, the larger at Bovedy, Northern Ireland, which gave its name to the fall. A meteorite that fell at Pultusk, Poland, in 1868, after fragmenting in the atmosphere, is estimated to have had a total weight of 2 tonnes among some 180,000 individual stones. Large meteoroids of more than c .100 tonnes that do not break up in the atmosphere are not completely decelerated before impact. On striking the sur- face at hypersonic velocity, their kinetic energy is released, causing them to vaporize and produce explosion craters, such as METEOR CRATER . Photographic observations of fireballs indicate that more than 19,000 meteorites heavier than 100 g land annually, but, of these, most fall in the oceans or deserts and fewer than 10 become known to science. Photo- g raphic observations and visual sightings of meteorite- producing fireballs show that they have orbits similar to those of EARTH - CROSSING ASTEROIDS . It is apparent that most meteorites come from the ASTEROID BELT , but a few come from the Moon ( LUNAR METEORITES ) or from Mars ( MARTIAN METEORITES ). Meteorites can be divided into three main types, according to their composition: STONY METEORITES ( CHONDRITES , A CHONDRITES ); STONY - IRON METEORITES ( MESOSIDERITES , P ALLASITES ); and IRON METEORITES . There is not always a clear-cut distinction between types: for example, many iron mete- orites contain silicate inclusions related to chondritic and achondritic meteorites. Some 95% of the meteorites seen to fall are stony meteorites, being composed dominantly of stony miner- als. Iron meteorites constitute the bulk of the remainder, while meteorites composed of equal-part mixtures of iron–nickel metal and stony material, known as stony- iron meteorites, are very rarely seen to fall. However, many more iron and stony-iron meteorites have been found than were observed to fall, which reflects their resistance to erosion and their distinctive appearance rel- a tive to terrestrial rocks, rather than a change in the com- position of the meteorite flux with time. Since 1969 mete- orites have been found in large numbers on the surface of the ice in parts of Antarctica. The small number of Antarctic iron meteorites relative to stony types is similar to the ratio in observed falls. Although frictional heating during atmospheric flight causes the outside of a meteoroid to melt, the molten material is swept into the atmosphere as droplets. The b ulk of the heat is removed with the melt, and the inside of the object stays cold. Only the melt during the last sec- ond of hypersonic flight solidifies on the object’s surface as it falls to Earth under gravity. The solidified melt is known as fusion crust. On most stony meteorites it is dull black, but on many achondrites it is a glossy black. Iron–nickel metal conducts heat more efficiently than stone, so some of the heat generated in atmospheric flight may penetrate to the interior of an iron meteorite. Stony meteorites, however, preserve a record of their history before their encounter with our planet. Meteorites often record shock or thermal events when they were part of their parent bodies. For example, many L-group ordinary chondrites were shock-reheated 500–1000 million years ago. Many chondrites preserve evidence of conditions in the Solar System of 4560 million years ago, and none has an age or isotopic signature consistent with an origin out- side it. They provide important clues to the origin and history of the Solar System, as well as records of condi- tions in inter-planetary space. Va r ious ages of meteorites can be measured. The for- mation interval is the period between stellar processing and the incorporation of an element into a meteorite. Chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium are synthesized in stars, and many meteorites preserve a record of these processes. Chondrites often contain the decay products of short-lived radionuclides, such as plu- tonium, indicating that this element was present in the matter from which the Solar System formed. From the quantity of plutonium that must have been present relative to other elemental abundances, the plutonium must have been formed within about 200 million years of the forma- tion of the Solar System. Most meteorites or their components, such as CHON - DRULES , went through a high-temperature event early in their history. The age of formation is the time, to the present, since a meteorite first cooled to become a closed chemical system. Uranium, for example, decays to lead at a fixed rate, and the uranium–lead age of a meteorite is the time that has elapsed since the uranium and lead w ere able to exchange freely, when the body was hot. The lead formed from the decay of uranium can be mea- sured; the quantity is proportional to the uranium con- tent, also measured, and to time, which usually is close to 4560 million years. When an object is broken from its parent asteroid, it continues to orbit the Sun. Cosmic rays from the Sun, and beyond, bombard its surface. The exposure age is the time during which this bombardment takes place. Radiation damage can be measured in various ways, including the content of a substance produced in nuclear reactions, such as a radioactive isotope of aluminium. (The levels of radioactivity in meteorites are so low that specially prepared, ultra-sensitive counting equipment is required for their measurement.) Exposure ages range from a few hundred thousand years for some stony meteorites to 1000 million years for a few iron mete- orites. These ages reflect the susceptibility of stony types to erosion by impact in space, compared with the dura- bility of iron–nickel metal. The terrestrial age is the time since a meteorite land- ed on Earth. The meteorite with the longest terrestrial age known is a chondrite within a 460-million-year-old Swedish Ordovician limestone. The second-longest ter- restrial age may be that of an iron meteorite found in 300- million-year-old coal in Russia. Apart from these examples, most meteorites have much shorter terrestrial ages. Some meteorites from Antarctica have lain in the ice for up to a million years, but these are exceptional. meteoroid 260 M Radiant RA Dec.

Meteoroids may be cometary or asteroidal in origin. The distinction between a large meteoroid and a small ASTEROID is rather vague; rocky bodies of, say, 10 m (30 ft) in diameter could fit into either category. Millimetre-sized dusty cometary meteoroids entering Earth’s atmosphere are completely destroyed by ABLATION , producing short-lived streaks of light seen in the night sky as METEORS . Cometary meteoroids have typical densities of 0.2 g/cm 3 . meteor shower Enhancement of METEOR activity produced when Earth runs through a METEOR STREAM . About 25 readily recognisable meteor showers occur each year, the most prominent being the QU ADRANTIDS , PERSEIDS and GEMINIDS . Meteor showers occur at the same time each year, reflecting Earth’s orbital position, and its intersection with the orbit of the particular meteor stream whose meteoroids are being swept up. Shower meteors appear to emerge from a single part of the sky, known as the RADIANT . Some showers are active only periodically as a result of uneven distribution of stream meteoroids, the GIACOBINIDS perhaps being the best example. The accompanying table lists some of the more important meteor showers; the zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) can vary, and values given here are intended only as a rough guide. meteor stream Tr ail of debris, usually from a COMET , comprised of METEOROIDS that share a common orbit around the Sun. Passage of Earth through such a stream gi v es rise to a METEOR SHOWER . Meteor streams may also be associated with some asteroids – most notably 3200 PHAETHON , the debris from which produces the GEMINIDS . Meteor streams undergo considerable evolution over their lifetimes, which are probably measured in tens of thousands of years. Initially, when the parent comet has only recently been captured into a short-period orbit, debris (released only at perihelion) is found relatively close to the comet NUCLEUS . Since the nucleus rotates, meteoroids are ejected both behind and ahead of the comet. Over successive returns, more material is added to the near-comet meteoroid cloud, which begins to spread around the orbit. Eventually, over an interval of only a few tens of years for a very short-period comet, up to thousands of years for those with longer periods, meteoroids will spread right around the orbit, completing loop formation. Many mete- or streams are believed to have a filamentary structure, with interwoven strands of meteoroids, released at sepa- rate perihelion returns of the parent comet, running through them. Gravitational perturbations by the planets, and the POYNTING – R OBERTSON EFFECT , serve to increase the spread of material in a stream. Stream meteoroids come to perihelion at very similar orbital positions (since this is where they are released from the parent nucleus) but show considerable spread in aphelion distances: consequently, meteor streams are much narrower and more concentrat- ed around the perihelion point. As a stream ages further, and its parent comet ceases to add new material, it begins to disperse, eventually merging into the general background of the zodiacal dust cloud permeating the inner Solar System. methane (CH 4 ) First of the alkanes or saturated acyclic h ydrocarbons. Its melting point is 90.7 K and its boiling point 109 K. It was discovered on Earth in 1778 by the Italian chemist Count Alessandro Volta (1745–1827). In 1935 it was detected in the atmosphere of Jupiter by Rupert WILDT from its spectrum lines. In 1977 it was identified in interstellar space through its emissions at a wa ve length of 3.9 mm. Methane is principally significant as a greenhouse gas. On the Earth, it presently makes a smaller contribu- tion to global warming than does carbon dioxide. Poten- tially though, methane could become much more important, even closing the 8 to 12 \u0001 m ‘window’ if the v ast quantities of the gas currently locked in permafrost regions are released as the Earth’s temperature rises. Methane is also found in significant quantities on TITAN , TRITON and PLUTO . On Titan, methane is the second most abundant atmospheric gas after nitrogen, though it still forms only a few per cent of the atmosphere. It may, however, also be present in liquid and/or solid form on the surface. On Triton and Pluto methane is present in small amounts, along with other frozen gases, as a thin solid surface coating. Metis One of the inner moons of JUPITER , discovered in 1979–80 by Stephen Synnott in images obtained by the VOYA GER project. It is irregular in shape, measuring about 60 \u0002 34 km (37 \u0002 21 mi). With ADRASTEA , Metis orbits within Jupiter’s main ring, about 128,000 km (80,000 mi) from the centre of the planet, taking 0.295 days to complete one of its near-circular equatorial orbits. Metis is the also name of a large MAIN - BELT ASTEROID , number 9, discovered in 1849. It has a diameter of about 190 km (120 mi). Metonic cycle Interval of 19 years after which the phases of the Moon recur on the same days of the year. This occurs because 19 years (6939.60 days) is almost exactly equal to 235 lunar months (6939.69 days). Its discovery is often attributed to the Greek astronomer Meton around 433 BC and the cycle forms the basis of the Greek and Jewish calendars. Meudon Observatory French observatory in a south- ern suburb of Paris, dating from 1876. It originated when Meudon’s ancient royal estate was placed at the disposal of astronomer Jules JANSSEN to pursue his research away from urban pollution. A large refractor of 0.83 m (32 in.) aperture and a 1-m (39-in.) reflector were commissioned in 1893, and other instruments followed, including solar telescopes. In 1925 Meudon became part of P ARIS OBSER - VAT O RY , and saw further expansion. Solar physics flour- ished at the observatory in the 1960s, and a 36-m (118-ft) high solar tower was erected in 1969. Astronomers from Meudon have traditionally used French facilities such as the PIC DU MIDI OBSERVATORY , and today use EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY and other international telescopes.

Michell, John (1724–93) English physicist and one of the first to suggest the possibility of black holes. In 1784 he made complex mathematical calculations describing the physical characteristics of a star with the same density as the Sun but having a much larger diameter, showing that the escape velocity for such a hypothetical object was the velocity of light. Michell concluded that light itself could therefore not escape from such a supermassive object.

The experiment attempted to detect the motion of the Earth through the luminiferous ether ( see LIGHT ). Their apparatus split a beam from a common source into two parts, one travelling at right angles to the other. Both beams were reflected and recombined to produce an INTERFERENCE pattern. If one beam were to travel out and back along the direction of the Earth’s supposed motion through the ether then, if light moved through the ether at a constant speed, it should take a marginally longer time to cover the same distance compared with a beam travelling at right angles to the Earth’s motion. Rotation of the two beams should have produced a readily detectable change in the observed interference pattern. However, no change was detected. The null result of this experiment was explained by the theory of SPECIAL RELATIVITY .

The microdensitometer provides a measure of both plate position and photo- graphic density, lending itself to applications in stellar ASTROMETRY and PHOTOMETRY . It operates by shining a beam of light through the plate and measuring the trans- mitted light. The plate is scanned in small strips, a mas- sive x – y table being used to move it relative to the beam. A complete scan is built up by moving the table in the y direction with the x coordinate fixed; once a strip is com- plete, the table is stepped by a few millimetres in the x direction and the next strip measured.

Micrometeorites arise from comets or from collisions between asteroids. The particles are dominantly silicates, with additional carbon, sulphides and metal. They are collected routinely from the atmosphere by research aircraft flying at altitudes between 18 and 22 km (11–14 mi). Micrometeorites may also be collected from localities on the Earth’s surface where the terrestrial dust component is in low abundance. One of the most successful recovery programmes involves the melting of large volumes of Antarctic ice and the subsequent filtering of the water; the Antarctic micrometeorites so recovered are little altered by terrestrial processes. micrometer Instrument attached to a telescope for mea- suring small angular separations of celestial objects. Sever- al different types exist. Both the binocular micrometer and the comparison image micrometer produce an artificial image of a pair of stars that can be viewed simultaneously with the real star images. The separation of the artificial pair can be adjusted until they match the real binary pair and the angle between them read on a scale. The cross wire micrometer contains two wires, crossed at 90º in the focal plane of the telescope. By mea- suring the TRANSIT times of stars, including those of known position, the RIGHT ASCENSION and DECLINATION of an object can be determined. A double image micrometer uses a split lens or prism to produce a doubling of the image. The orienta- tion of the field may be adjusted to bring the line of the separated lenses into line with a pair of double stars, so determining their position angle relative to the north point or zero. The objective - grating micrometer uses a coarse grating or bars to produce a diffraction pattern from which the separation of double stars can be measured, while the reticulated micrometer consists of a grid of parallel lines which cross each other at 90º. Any two stars in the field of view can be so lined up on the grid so that their relative positions can be estimated. The ring micrometer consists of a ring of opaque material on glass placed in the focal plane of the tele- scope’s objective or primary mirror. The ring, whose internal dimensions against the sky have been determined, is used to time any two stars close enough in the field of view to cross the ring so that their relevant angular separa- tions can be calculated.

Milky Way F aint luminous band that encircles the sky at an angle of about 63º to the celestial equator. It is irregular and patchy and varies from about 3º to 30º in width. It is easily visible to the naked eye from a good site on a clear moonless night, especially the southern section around Sagittarius. Through even a small telescope it can be seen to be composed of millions of faint stars, and it is in fact the part of our own GALAXY immediately surrounding the Sun ( see ORION ARM ). The distribution of stars is essentially uniform, and the patchiness results from absorption of starlight in some regions by D ARK NEBULAE such as the COALSACK , PIPE NEBULA and CYGNUS RIFT .

Miller, Stanley See UREY , HAROLD millimetre-wave astronomy Study of extraterrestrial objects that emit in the region of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM between 1 mm and 10 mm (300 GHz and 30 GHz) wavelength, originally part of the radio and microwave region. It was defined as a separate region of the spectrum because of the special equipment and techniques needed to observe astronomical objects at these wavelengths. The science undertaken using the millimetre wavelength range focuses on studying the places where new stars form, molecules, and very cold material, but many types of astronomical object can be detected at millimetre wavelengths. Millimetre-wave telescopes are built at high, dry sites, since millimetre waves are absorbed by the water vapour in Earth’s atmosphere. The detectors are cooled to lower the BACKGROUND NOISE and to increase sensitivity in a manner similar to the techniques used for INFRARED ASTRONOMY . Many radio techniques can be applied at millimetre wavelengths, such as those used for RADIO INTERFEROMETERS and APERTURE SYNTHESIS . Since the wa v elengths are smaller, the telescopes can be smaller and the distances between them less, to achieve the same resolution. Several large millimetre arrays have been built, such as INSTITUT DE RADIO ASTRONOMIE MILLIMÉTRIQUE (IRAM) in Europe, Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) and BERKELEY ILLINOIS MARYLAND ASSOCIA - TION (BIMA) in the United States, and NOBEYAMA in J apan; there is an international project to build an array of 64 telescopes in Chile called ATA CAMA LARGE MILLIME - TRE ARRAY (ALMA), due for completion around 2010 (first science observations in 2006). The arrays are used to map small structures such as cold dust disks around protostars. The energy distribution of the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND peaks at 1 mm. Several important molecules are observed in the mil- limetre region, the most important being CO (carbon monoxide) at 2.6 mm and 1.3 mm, the spectral emission lines from the lowest energy levels in the molecule. CO can be used to trace molecular hydrogen and thus CO surveys have mapped the distribution of the coldest gas in the Galaxy. The CO line is easily saturated because of the large number of molecules in the lines of sight in the Galaxy, but several isotopes ( 13 CO and C 18 O) can also be detected and these have lower densities and so are not sat- urated. Whilst CO traces the low-density gas, CS and HCN can trace higher densities, so that regions of star formation can be probed using different molecules to map different temperature and density regimes.

The first millisecond pulsar to be discovered had a period of 1.6 ms or 0.0016 s (as compared to the CRAB PULSAR , which has a period of 0.033 s). It is believed to be over a hundred million years old, and it has a weak magnetic field, which is why it has not slowed its rotation as expected. There are now more than forty millisecond pulsars known, with periods up to 300 ms; roughly half are in binary systems. Mills, Bernard Yarnton (1920– ) Australian engineer and radio astronomer, and inventor of the Mills Cross radio telescope. He designed and built many different types of radio telescope. Mills Cross, named after its designer, was built in 1954 and featured two 457-m (1500-ft) arrays. The culmination of Mills’ career came with the design and construction of the Molonglo Cross, a huge 408-MHz radio telescope with an aperture of 1600 m (1 mi), completed in 1967. Mills Cross One of the earliest radio arrays, designed by Bernard Mills of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Sydney, Australia. The antennae were arranged along two lines 1500 ft long (457 m) at right angles. It was used to map the Magellanic clouds. See also RADIO ASTRONOMY Milne, (Edward) Arthur (1896–1950) English theoretical astrophysicist and cosmologist. At Cambridge’s Solar Physics Observatory (1920–32) he solved fundamental problems of stellar atmospheres and structure. His most valuable work, involving the mathematical modelling of radiative equilibrium and thermal ionization in stellar atmospheres, enabled astronomers to predict a star’s temperature and a tmospheric pressures from measurements of the widths and intensities of its spectral lines, and by relating the optical depths, or opacities, of stellar atmospheres to spectral features. Milne was the first astrophysicist to correctly explain that instabilities in the balance between radiation pressure and gravity in the chromosphere of the Sun and similar stars could eject atoms at velocities of 1000 km/s (600 mi/s).

See BECRUX Minkowski, Hermann (1864–1909) German mathematician and professor of physics at Zürich and Göttingen who, in 1908, suggested that non-Euclidean space and time were intimately related and that events should be considered in the context of a four-dimensional spacetime continuum. Before Minkowski’s theoretical work, space and time were held to be separate entities. Einstein incorporated the concept of the spacetime continuum into his theory of general relativity. Minkowski, Rudolph Leo (1895–1976) German- American astrophysicist (born in Strasbourg, now in France) who greatly advanced the understanding of supernovae and sources of radio waves. He moved to the USA, joining the staff of Mount Wilson Observatory (1935–60), and later worked at the Radio Astronomical Laboratory in Berkeley, California (1960–65). Minkowski was an expert on the spectra of non-stellar objects and made an important study of the Orion Nebula (M42). In 1939 he classified supernovae into Types I and II based upon their spectral lines. He also studied supernova remnants such as the Crab Nebula (M1), which was found to contain a pulsar. He made extensive studies of planetary nebulae and set up his own survey which more than doubled the number known. With Walter BAADE , Minkowski was able to identify the optical counterparts of many of the strongest radio sources in the sky, including Cygnus A (1951). In 1960 he used the 200-inch (5-m) Hale Telescope to discover the galaxy that corresponded to the radio source 3C 295; for 15 years, the redshift he found for this object ( z = 0.48) remained the highest known. Minkowski supervised the PALOMAR OBSERVATORY SKY SURVEY (POSS). Minnaert, Marcel Gilles Josef (1893–1970) Flemish astrophysicist who was an expert on the behaviour of light. Minnaert joined the University of Utrecht’s (Belgium) solar physics group after World War I and later became director of Utrecht Observatory (1937–63). He compiled the Utrecht Atlas of the solar spectrum (1940) and devised a new way of diagnosing stellar atmospheres by constructing a ‘curve of growth’. minor planet Synonym for ASTEROID . ‘Minor planet’ is the term preferred by the INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION .

A minute of arc is subdivided into SECONDS OF ARC , or arc- seconds, being 1/60 of a minute of arc and 1/360 of a degree. ANGULAR MEASURE is used widely in astronomy to determine the diameter or separation of celestial objects. Mir (‘Peace’) Successor to the Soviet Union’s SALYUT SPACE STATIONS . The core module (also known as the base block), which was launched on 1986 February 20, was the backbone of the Mir SPACE STATION . Its most notable innovation was the provision of six docking ports, which enabled additional modules to be attached to the station in 1987–96 as well as the temporary docking of manned and unmanned resupply ships. The Mir core module was the principal control centre for the station, and it was equipped with its own orbital manoeuvring engines. Although these could not be used after the arrival of Kvant (the first station module), the base block still provided the principal propellant storage tanks and primary attitude control for the entire space sta- tion. The core section also provided 90 cubic metres (3200 cubic feet) of habitable space, and contained the main computers, communications equipment, kitchen and hygiene facilities, and primary living quarters. Mimosa 264 M \u0001 Mira At maximum (left), Mira ( \u0004 Ceti) is roughly mag. 3.0 and at minimum (right) about mag. 9.9. It is a red giant, with a diameter about 300 times that of the Sun. It is undergoing extensive mass loss in a very strong stellar wind. \u0002 Mir The space shuttle Atlantis is seen here leaving Mir after mission STS-71.

All except the assembly com- partment were pressurized. A small airlock was also avail- able for experiments or for the release of small satellites or refuse. Exercise equipment was located in the conical por- tion of the working compartment. Spatial orientation was aided by dark-green carpet on the ‘floor’, light-green walls and a white ‘ceiling’ with fluorescent lamps. The Vozdukh electrolytic system was used to recycle station atmosphere, with a back-up chemical scrubbing system. The first addition to the core section came in 1987: the 11-tonne Kvant (Quantum) astrophysical module con- tained a number of X-ray, gamma-ray and ultraviolet astronomy experiments. Next to arrive, in 1989, was the 19.6-tonne Kvant-2, which was designed to improve liv- ing conditions on the station as well as carry out scientific research. The 19.6-tonne Kristall followed in 1990, with a number of furnaces intended for materials processing. In 1995 the Spektr (Spectrum) module delivered many US scientific experiments to the station. This module was abandoned after a collision with a Progress spacecraft on 1997 June 25. The final Russian-made module to be a ttached to Mir was Priroda (Nature), which was devoted largely to Earth observation. A US interface module was added to Kristall in 1995, opening the way for the Space Shuttle to dock with Mir on nine occasions. Cosmonauts on Mir carried out hundreds of experi- ments involving such diverse research as production of new alloys, protein crystal growth, production of semi- conductors, Earth observation and astronomy. However, the space station was plagued by problems, including equipment failures, lack of power, decompression after a collision and at least one serious fire. Mir was almost permanently occupied from 1986 Feb- r uary until 1999 August. During its lifetime it hosted 28 long-term crews and was visited by 104 cosmonauts/astro- nauts. Mir re-entered Earth’s atmosphere in 2001 March. Mira (Omicron Ceti) First star to be discovered to vary in a periodic manner. David F ABRICIUS first noticed Mira as of third magnitude on 1596 August 13. He could not find it in star catalogues, atlases or globes. A few months later it was invisible, but he saw it again on 1609 F ebruary 15 at third magnitude. Johann BAYER , in 1603, lettered it Omicron and noted it as of fourth magnitude. It was observed from 1659 to 1682 and thought to be a new star, catalogued 68 of sixth magnitude. Johann Holwarda (1618–51), in 1638, noted that Mira became visible to the naked eye from time to time and invisible in between these times. In 1660 the star was shown to vary in an approximate period of 11 months. Its period is 331.96 days, but sub- ject to irregularities. Mean range in brightness is 3.0 to 9.9 mags. Maxima have been observed as bright as mag. 1.7 and as faint as mag. 4.9. Minima show a similar vari- a tion of from mag. 8.6 to 11.1. The magnitude of a future maximum or minimum is not predictable. Usually Mira has a protracted minimum phase followed by a steep rise and a slow decline. The spectrum varies M5e to M9e, which is that of a cool star. There are strong bands of titanium oxide and also lines of neutral metals. An EMISSION SPECTRUM becomes superimposed on the ABSORPTION spectrum when Mira has reached seventh magnitude on the rise, with the intensities of the lines increasing to well after maximum light; they then disappear. The emission spec- trum is mainly hydrogen. Mira lies at a distance of 196 l.y. Robert AITKEN discov- ered a faint companion to Mira in 1923. The separation is 0 \u0001 .61; the companion is now known as VZ Ceti, a variable with a range of mag. 9.5 to 12. It shows small variations in times of several hours on which are superimposed 10- to 15-minute variations. It also has very occasional flares, which last for about two minutes. It is possible that VZ Ceti is a white dwarf with an accretion disk. It orbits Mira in 1800 years. See also MIRA STAR Mirach The star \u0002 Andromedae, visual mag. 2.06, distance 199 l.y., spectral type M0 III. Its name is a corruption of the Arabic word mi’zar , meaning ‘loin cloth’. Miranda Smallest and innermost of the five SATELLITES of URANUS that were known before VOYA GER 2’s flyby in 1986. It was discovered in 1948 by Gerard KUIPER . Miranda’s dimensions of 480 \u0003 468 \u0003 466 km (298 \u0003 291 \u0003 290 mi) are just large enough for it to be pulled into a near-spherical shape by its own gravity. Miranda w as expected to be a passive ice-ball, like Saturn’s satellite MIMAS , and therefore not especially interesting. However, at the time of the Voyager 2 encounter, the orientation of Uranus and its satellite orbits was such that it was convenient to direct the probe closer to Miranda than to any of the other satellites, and Miranda turned out to be one of the most fascinating bodies in the Solar System. Like all Uranus’ satellites seen by Voyager 2, only the southern hemisphere of Miranda was sunlit at the time, b ut that was enough to show a world unlike any other known planetary body. Just over half the area seen is heav- ily cratered, but most of the craters are blurred, as if blan- keted with dust or ‘snow’, perhaps dispersed from explosive cryovolcanic eruptions ( see CRYOVOLCANISM ). The rest of the visible hemisphere is occupied by three remarkable tracts of terrain, referred to as ‘coronae’. They do not closely resemble one another and, apart from their v aguely concentric pattern, they have little in common 265 M 76-0292 \u0001 Miranda Uranus’ satellite Miranda was discovered by Gerard Kuiper in 1948.

Miranda’s coronae are named Arden, Inverness and Elsinore after the settings of some of Shakespeare’s plays. Inverness Corona was informally referred to as ‘the Chevron’, for its V shape. Craters within these coronae are fresh and sharp in appearance, as are the younger craters elsewhere, so evidently the global mantling of the older terrain took place before the coronae were created. It is unclear how Miranda’s coronae originated. Arden and Elsinore Coronae were only partly visible, so their complete shape is unknown. When the images were first received it was suggested that Miranda is a body that re- accreted following collisional break-up. Each corona was thought to represent a discrete fragment, the tonal band- ing apparent in Arden and Inverness Coronae represent- ing cross-sections through the interior of the original body. This explanation now seems unlikely, if only because of the much greater age of the terrain between the coronae, as judged by comparing the relative numbers of impact craters. The edges of Inverness Corona appear to be related to faults. An alternative explanation, however, is that this and other coronae overlie internal density anom- alies inherited from a re-accretion event. If so, each corona could have been created by a past episode of TIDAL HEAT - ING through orbital interaction with ARIEL or UMBRIEL . The bright patches on Arden and Inverness Coronae could perhaps be fresh powder erupted from explosive v ents. On the other hand, Elsinore Corona lacks tonal va ri a tions and is more likely to be a product of multiple eruptions of cryovolcanic lava. In contrast with Saturn’s satellites, where the presence of ammonia is possible but not required by models of Solar System formation, it is extremely likely that Uranus’ icy satellites contain a signif- icant proportion of ammonia mixed with the water ice. The lavas this mixture is likely to produce would be highly viscous, which could explain Elsinore Corona’s bulbous r idges. See data at URANUS Mira star (M) Class of V ARIABLE STAR named after MIRA , the first star found to vary with an approximate period of several months. They are also called long-period variables and red variables, although the latter term is ambiguous, gi ve n that there are several other types of variable with late spectral classes. Mira stars are GIANTS or SUPERGIANTS belonging to the disk population and with periods ranging from 100 to 1000 days. The difference in their periods stems from whether they are Population I or II. The former generally have periods longer than 200 days, while the periods of Population II stars tend to be shorter and less than 200 days. The visual light variations of Mira variables range from mag. 2.5 to 11, but in the infrared their amplitudes are much smaller, below mag. 2.5 and less than one magni- tude for most of them. Each star has a mean cycle – that is, an average period during which it goes through a com- plete cycle from maximum and back to maximum again or from minimum to minimum. These periods for any one star may vary by about 15%. Thus their periods are to some extent irregular. Amplitudes may also vary widely from one cycle to the next. Their light-curves show a wide diversity, but fall into three main divisions. There are those stars that have r ises steeper than the fall; these tend to have wide minima and sharp, short maxima. As the asymmetry becomes g reater, the period lengthens. Stars with symmetrical curves have the shortest periods. A third group shows humps on their curves or have double maxima and have long and short periods. Mira variables have late-type emission spectra. The longer the period, the later the spectral type. They show a spectral (or temperature) relationship that is a continua- tion of the same relationship found in CEPHEID VARIABLES . Both Mira variables and Cepheids are hotter at maxi- mum, Mira variables having the smaller range in tempera- ture. Pulsation is thus the underlying cause of their va r iability. Pulsations send running waves through the surface layers. Mirphak (Algenib) The star \u0001 Pe r sei, visual mag. 1.79, distance 592 l.y., spectral type F5 Ib. Its name, which is also spelled Mirfak , comes from the Arabic mirfaq , mean- ing ‘elbow’. Its alternative name, Algenib , comes from the Arabic al-ja ̄ nib , meaning ‘the side’. mirror Reflecting surface used to shape or steer light beams. Mirrors have been used to collect and focus starlight since Sir Isaac NEWTON constructed the first successful reflecting telescope in 1668. His design is still in use today and the NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE remains one of the most popular types amongst amateur astronomers. It consists of a concave mirror that reflects the incoming light from a star towards a focal point immediately in front of the mirror. A second small flat mirror is used to intercept the light before it reaches the FOCUS and to steer it out to one side where the observer can use an EYEPIECE to magnify and examine the image. Newton’s first telescope used mirrors made of polished metal that had low reflectivity and tarnished easily. Never- theless, it overcame the inherent problem of CHROMATIC ABERRATION that had affected early refracting telescopes. Improvements in materials made metal reflectors more useful, in particular the development of speculum metal, an alloy of 71% copper and 29% tin. This metal could be polished to provide fairly high reflectivity, but it still tar- nished and needed periodic re-polishing. The largest successful reflector using speculum metal w as the 72-inch (1.8 m) Newtonian telescope built by the Earl of Rosse at BIRR CASTLE in Ireland in 1842. Optical mirror technology took another big step for- w ard with the development of coating techniques to place a highly reflective thin metal coating on to glass. Initially silver was used but aluminium is more common today as it produces a more durable surface. Almost all mirrors used in astronomy are coated in aluminium, although gold, sil- v er and other materials are used where their special prop- erties are needed. Amateur telescope mirrors often have a protective overcoat of silicon dioxide to increase the life of the aluminium coating. Professional telescopes usually dispense with the overcoat but are re-coated periodically, often every one or two years. The largest single (monolithic) mirrors used in astron- omy at present are just over 8 m (310 in.) in diameter. They are quite thin relative to their diameter (to keep w eight down) and require elaborate support mechanisms to maintain their very accurate shapes as they point to dif- ferent parts of the sky. Segmented mirrors of 10-m (393-in.) diameter are in use and even larger telescopes are planned using this technique. The largest mirror in space at present is the 2.4-m (94-in.) diameter mirror of the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE ; the NEXT GENERATION SPACE TELESCOPE is planned to have a segmented mirror around 4 m (160 in.) in diameter. Mirzam The star \u0002 Canis Majoris, visual mag. 1.98, dis- tance 499 l.y., spectral type B1 II or III. It is a BETA CEPHEI STAR , a pulsating variable with a period of 6 hours and a total range of less than 0.1 mag. The name comes from the Arabic murzim , meaning ‘announcer’, thought to refer to the fact that it rises before the much brighter Sirius. missing mass problem Quandary whereby most of the matter in the Universe seems to be either subluminous or else invisible. This dark matter is thought to surround individual galaxies as haloes and to pervade clusters of galaxies. The first evidence of dark matter came from the work of Jan OORT , who, in 1932, determined the thickness of our Galaxy in the solar neighbourhood from the loca- tions of red giants in the sky. These bright stars are suffi- ciently numerous that a map of their distribution in space reveals that the galactic disk has a thickness of about 2000 l.y. In addition, however, Oort used the dis- tribution and speeds of the red giants in his study to cal- culate the vertical gravitational field of the Galaxy as well as the mass in our vicinity needed to produce it. A dilem- Mira star 266 M M AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 6:49 pm Page 266"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Mitchell, Maria ma arose when Oort compared this calculated mass with the observed masses of all the stars and gas clouds in the solar neighbourhood. The observed mass is only about half that needed to confine the red giants to a disk 2000 l.y. thick. Thus half of the matter in our part of the Galaxy seems to be invisible. Observations of the rotation of the Galaxy confirm the existence of this invisible matter. The rotation rate of the inner regions of our Galaxy is determined from bright stars and emission nebulae. In the dim outer regions, radio observations of hydrogen and carbon monoxide in giant gas clouds provide the required data. In all cases, Doppler shift measurements ( see DOPPLER EFFECT ) are combined with information about the posi- tion of a source to deduce its circular velocity around the galactic centre. The results are best displayed on a plot of circular velocity against distance from the galactic centre. Beyond the confines of most of the Galaxy’s matter, the orbital velocity of outlying stars should decrease according to Kepler’s third law, just as the velocities of the planets decrease with increasing distance from the Sun. The dashed line in the accompanying diagram indicates such a Keplerian decline. However, the rotation curve of the Galaxy is nearly flat, even to a distance of 60,000 l.y. from the galactic centre. This means that astronomers have still not detected the edge of the Galaxy and thus a substantial quantity of invisible matter must exist beyond the observable stars, nebulae and gas clouds. The conventional picture of our Galaxy is a flattened disk 100,000 l.y. in diameter surrounded by a spherical halo of old stars and globular clusters roughly 130,000 l.y. across. Recent analyses of rotation curve data strong- ly suggest that the galactic halo is embedded in an enor- mous ‘corona’ that is roughly 600,000 l.y. in diameter and contains at least 10 12 solar masses of subluminous matter. Thus the corona is at least five times more mas- sive than the disk and halo combined. Most other spiral galaxies also exhibit flat rotation curves and thus they too must be surrounded by large, massive coronae. The distribution of matter in such a galaxy can be compared with its luminosity by constructing the mass- to-light ratio, M / L . In essence, M / L tells us how much matter there is in a given region compared with the radi- a tion that it generates. By definition, M / L for the Sun is 1.0 (that is, 1 solar mass produces 1 solar luminosity), and 0.8 for a typical globular cluster. From a rotation curve, astronomers calculate the rate at which the matter density declines with distance from a galaxy’s centre. However, a galaxy’s surface brightness decreases much more rapidly with distance from its cen- tre. Since the brightness falls much more rapidly than the matter density, M / L climbs to 50 or more in the outer regions of such a galaxy. This dramatic increase in the mass-to-light ratio is the crux of the missing mass prob- lem: an increasing proportion of non-luminous matter is found as one moves outwards from a galaxy’s centre. A partial solution of this aspect of the missing mass problem came with the detection of several faint BROWN DW ARF stars in the halo of our Galaxy. If the brown dwarfs are distributed as evenly as they appear to be, then they might account for some of the missing mass in our Galaxy. Apparently, the space between galaxies in a cluster is also dominated by non-luminous matter. In the 1930s, Fritz Zwicky and Sinclair Smith pointed out that the Virgo Cluster must contain a substantial amount of non- luminous matter, otherwise there would not be enough gr a vity to hold the cluster together. The mass of a cluster of galaxies can be determined from the VIRIAL THEOREM , which relates the average speed of the galaxies to the size of the cluster. For example, the Coma Cluster contains roughly 1000 bright galaxies spread over a volume 10 million l.y. in diameter. Doppler shift measurements are available for 800 Coma galaxies and the average velocity relative to the cluster’s centre is about 860 km/s (530 mi/s). These data along with the vir- ial theorem give a total mass of 5 \u0001 10 15 solar masses for the Coma Cluster. If each of the 1000 brightest galaxies has a mass of 10 12 solar masses then we are able to account for only one-fifth of the cluster’s mass. Similar results are obtained for other rich clusters. Such clusters typically have mass-to-light ratios in the range of 200 to 350, clearly indicating a substantial pres- ence of dark matter. This missing mass problem was also recently solved when X-rays from the centres of large galaxy clusters were seen. These X-rays indicated the presence of large amounts of hot gas that radiated pri- marily in the X-ray region of the spectrum, and thus w ere invisible in the optical region. The amount of this gas is generally estimated to be enough to bind the clus- ters together as required by the virial theorem. The issue of missing mass also arises on the largest cosmological scales. According to the general theory of relativity, the expansion rate of the Universe must be slow- ing down because of the mutual gravitational attraction of all the matter in the Universe. Astronomers detect this cosmic deceleration by measuring the recessional veloci- ties and distances of extremely remote galaxies. The pur- pose of such observations is to determine the so-called DECELERATION PARAMETER ( q 0 ), which is directly related to the average density throughout space. Thus, by mea- suring the rate at which the cosmic expansion is slowing down, astronomers can deduce the average density of matter in the Universe. Observations indicate that the average density of matter in the Universe is near the CRITICAL DENSITY of 5 \u0001 l0 \u0002 30 g/cm 3 , which is equivalent to about three hydro- gen atoms per cubic metre of space. This density is called ‘critical’ because it ensures that the Universe will just barely continue expanding for ever, without ever collapsing back upon itself. However, the average density of matter that astronomers actually observe in space is about 3 \u0001 l0 \u0002 31 g/cm 3 . Thus the observed matter is less than a tenth that needed to account for the Universe’s behaviour. With the inflationary model ( see INFLATION ), and observations indicating that the Universe is actually accel- erating, the need for non-luminous matter is eliminated. Mitchell, Maria (1818–89) First American woman astronomer of note. Her father, William Mitchell, was a respected amateur astronomer, and from him she got her love of astronomy and her observing skills. She assisted him in observations he made, for example timing the con- tacts of an annular eclipse in 1831. In 1836 she became a librarian, and in the same year the US Coast Survey equipped the Mitchell family home as an outstation, installing an observatory. She began making regular observations, and achieved world fame with her discovery of a comet, C/1847 T1. From 1849 to 1868 she was employed by the US Gov- ernment Almanac Office to compute ephemerides for V enus. From 1865 until her death she worked at Vassar F emale College at Poughkeepsie, NY (of which she had been a founding member in 1861), as both professor of astronomy and director of the observatory there.

Such clouds abound within the spiral arms of galaxies, including our own. The clouds’ temperatures may be as low as 10 K, and their number densities as much as 10 12 m \u0002 3 , which is a million times the average density of INTERSTELLAR MATTER . The clouds’ sizes range from less than a light-year to several hundred light-years, and their masses range from a few solar masses to several million times the mass of the Sun. Clouds with masses that exceed 10,000 solar masses are called GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUDS . The clouds are difficult to observe because of their low temperatures. In the visible region, they may sometimes be seen silhouetted against bright backgrounds, since the dust particles within them absorb light. In the radio region the most abundant molecule, hydrogen, does not emit, so the clouds have to be found from the emissions of their less abundant molecules such as carbon monoxide ( see INTERSTELLAR MOLECULES ).

This can be measured with respect to a number of different reference points, but the most commonly used is the SYNODIC MONTH , the period between successive new or full moons (29.53059 days of MEAN SOLAR TIME ). The CALENDAR month is a man- made method of dividing the year into twelve, roughly equal, parts. Because the total of complete lunar cycles in a year is not a whole number, synodic months cannot be simply reconciled with the common calendar. However, 235 lunar months is almost exactly equal to 19 years ( see METONIC CYCLE ) and while the modern civil calendar is based on the year, the dates of religious festivals (such as Easter) are still set by reference to the lunar month.

Although it is so bright (the full Moon has apparent visual magnitude of \u0001 12.7) its surface rocks are dark, and the Moon’s albedo is only 0.07. It is a cratered world, in many ways a typical Solar System satellite. It is the only other world whose surface features can easily be seen from the Earth, and the only other world on which humans have walked. As the Moon orbits the Earth, it is seen to go through a sequence of PHASES as the proportion of the illuminat- ed hemisphere visible to us changes. A complete sequence, from one new moon to the next, is called a lunation. At new moon or full moon, eclipses can occur. An observer on the Earth always sees the same side of the Moon because the Moon has SYNCHRONOUS ROTA - TION : its orbital period (the SIDEREAL MONTH ) around the Earth is the same as its axial rotation period. The vis- ible side is called the nearside, and the side invisible from the Earth is the farside. In fact, the face the Moon pre- sents to us does vary slightly because of a number of effects known collectively as LIBRATION . The Moon has been studied by many space probes, including the LUNA and ZOND series launched by the for- mer Soviet Union, and the US series RANGER , SURVEYOR and LUNAR ORBITER . The manned APOLLO missions and some of the later Luna probes returned samples of lunar material to the Earth for study. In the 1990s, the CLEMENTINE and LUNAR PROSPECTOR probes gathered much valuable new information. The surface features may be broadly divided into the darker maria ( see MARE ), which are low-lying volcanic plains, and the brighter HIGHLAND regions, which occur predominantly in the southern part of the Moon’s near- side and over the entire farside. There are impact fea- tures of all sizes. The largest are called BASINS , produced during the early history of the Moon when bombard- ment by impacting objects was at its heaviest. On the nearside, where the crust is thinner, some basins were subsequently filled with upwelling lava to produce the maria, which in turn became cratered. In the regions of CRATERS at the north and south poles, the interiors of which are in permanent shadow, water ice exists just below the surface. The smaller basins are similar to the largest craters, formerly called walled plains, which have flat floors and are surrounded by a ring of mountains. Other features are mountain peaks and ranges, valleys, elongated depressions known as RILLES , wrinkle ridges, low hills called domes, and EJECTA and bright RAYS radi- a ting from the sites of the more recent cratering impacts. Early lunar cartographers assumed that the darker lunar features were expanses of water, and named them after fanciful oceans (oceanus), seas (mare), bays (sinus), lakes (lacus) and swamps (palus). Other features are named after famous people, principally astronomers and other scientists. The old names are still in use on lunar maps. At present, the most generally accepted theory of the Moon’s origin is the GIANT IMPACTOR THEORY , accord- ing to which a Mars-sized body collided with the newly formed Earth, and debris from the impact accreted to form the Moon. Impacts during the accretion process melted the lunar surface to a depth of 300 km (190 mi), forming a magma ocean. As accretion slowed, the magma ocean began to cool, allowing minerals to crys- tallize. DIFFERENTIATION led to formation of a crust. Many of the most prominent lunar features are scars from a final stage of accretion ( LATE HEAVY BOMBARD - MENT ). Massive impacts produced basins such as Mare IMBRIUM and Mare ORIENTALE . Impact ejecta covered the lunar surface in a deep blanket of fragmented mater- ial, the mega- REGOLITH . Flooding of the basins by lava from the lunar mantle (kept molten by radioactive decay) led to formation of the darker maria. Smaller impacts gave rise to the craters. A volcanic origin for the craters has long been dismissed by most astronomers, but Clementine photographed a volcanic crater near the large farside crater Schrödinger. Mild moonquakes occur at depths of roughly 700 km (450 mi), and LUNAR TRANSIENT PHENOMENA appear to be associated with them; otherwise, the Moon is now geologically inactive. Seismic measurements at Apollo landing sites provided some information on the Moon’s internal structure. The lunar crust is about 100 km (60 mi) thick in the highland regions, but only a few tens of kilometres thick under the mare basins. Under the largest basins the underlying man- tle has bulged upwards to form MASCONS . An iron-rich core a few hundred kilometres across might exist, with a temperature at the centre of about 1500 K. There is a small iron core at the Moon’s centre, accounting for about 4% of its mass. Although there is now no significant over- all magnetic field, there are distinct ‘magnetic areas’ extending for hundreds of kilometres. Knowledge of lunar rocks and their compositions is based largely on laboratory analyses of the 382 kg of material returned to Earth by the Apollo missions. Plane- tary geologists have identified several types of lunar rocks. Lunar BASALTS are fine-grained igneous rocks that formed from cooled lavas; they contain two characteris- tic minerals – pyroxene and plagioclase. Ending about 3 billion years ago, the volcanic activity that produced these rocks consisted of very gradual, thin flows of lava with much lower viscosity than terrestrial lavas; these spread out in thin sheets covering millions of square kilo- metres instead of building up shield volcanoes of the kind seen on Earth and Mars. Another important class of lunar rocks are the BREC - CIAS found in the highlands. Breccias consist of a matrix of stony fragments (mostly granite), with finer mineral components gluing the fragments together. The breccias are rich in whitish-coloured calcium, magnesium and aluminium, which explains why the lunar highlands appear much brighter than the maria. The Apollo missions also discovered two minerals unique to the Moon. ANORTHOSITE is a coarse calcium feldspar that is a major constituent of the lunar crust. The other, KREEP , consists of potassium (chemical sym- bol K), rare earth elements and phosphorous. 269 M \u0001 Moon Much of the Moon’s surface is covered in a fine dust, called the lunar regolith. Because there is no wind or weathering, this material r emains just as it settles, and the marks of small impacts, as well as astronauts with lunar carts, remain more or less permanently.

Consequently the surface temperature varia- tion is extreme, ranging from 100 to 400 K. moon Natural SATELLITE of one of the larger bodies in the Solar System. Mars, for example, possesses two moons, PHOBOS and DEIMOS . Each of the giant planets is accompanied by a large retinue of moons. Smaller moons may be termed moonlets, and the distinction between a moon/moonlet and a body too small to be so classified (for example, the billions of individual items comprising planetary ring systems) is arbitrary.

After serving in the Royal Air Force during W orld War II, he wrote the first of over 60 books on astronomy aimed at a popular audience. In the 1950s, with Hugh Percy Wilkins (1896–1960), he used Meudon Observatory’s 33-inch (0.84-m) refractor to make a thorough survey of the Moon’s topography, discovering many new features.

He spent his entire career at Yerkes Observatory (1926–94), briefly serving as its director (1960–63). Assisted by Philip Childs Keenan (1908–2000) and Edith Marie Kellman (1911– ), Morgan classified huge numbers of stars into six different LUMINOSITY CLASSES . This luminosity classification was combined with a new two-dimensional spectral classification in An Atlas of Stel- lar Spectra With an Outline of Spectral Classification (1943), still the standard work in its field. The MOR - GAN – KEENAN CLASSIFICATION (abbreviated to MK or MKK system) allowed ‘normal’ stars to be distinguished from peculiar A-type and metallic-line A stars. It also made possible vastly more accurate calibrations of stellar distances, especially for the nearer of the O and B stars. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Morgan and Harold JOHNSON developed a new system for measuring stellar magnitudes in three basic colours or wavebands: U (ultra- violet), B (blue) and V (visual, or yellow). They combined their UBV SYSTEM (which Johnson later extended) with the MKK system to improve distance estimates for stars and star clusters. In 1957 Morgan used these tools to devise the first system for classifying the integrated spectra of globular clusters. He went on to classify galaxies by com- paring the galaxy’s integrated spectrum with its bulge-to- disk ratio, in what was called the Yerkes system.

In the early 1940s, William MORGAN , Philip Keenan (1908–2000) and Edith Kellman (1911– ) extended the one- dimensional temperature-dependent HARVARD CLASSIFICATION (OBAFGKM) to two dimensions by adding Roman numerals to indicate luminosity – I for supergiant, II for bright giant, III for giant, IV for subgiant and V for dwarf. Brighter supergiants are Ia, lesser ones Ib. (The Roman letters are also commonly used to separate giants of different luminosities, with IIIa being brighter than IIIb.)

The essence of the system is a set of MK blue-violet photographic spectra of standard stars against which others stars are compared and which form the basis for the extension of the system to other wa v elength domains.

It is equipped with two antennae: a 26-m (85-ft) donated to the University by NASA in 1985, and a 14-m (46-ft). Mount Stromlo Observatory One of the oldest insti- tutions in the Australian Capital Territory, at an alti- tude of 760 m (2500 ft) in the south-western suburbs of Canberra. It was founded in 1924 as the Common- w ealth Solar Observatory, and in the 1920s and 1930s research was conducted there on solar and atmospheric physics. In 1957 the Observatory became part of the Australian National University. During the same decade, four new instruments came to the mountain, including the 1.88-m (74-in.) reflector (for twenty y ears the joint-largest telescope in the southern hemi- sphere) and a 1.27-m (50-in.) reflector that had started life in 1868 as the Great Melbourne Telescope. This instrument, now refurbished, is used for the MASSIVE COMPACT HALO OBJECT dark-matter project. During the 1960s, under the directorship of Bart BOK , Mount Stromlo founded SIDING SPRING OBSERVATORY to escape the light pollution of Canberra, and the institu- tion became the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories (MSSSO). In 1998 the name was changed again to the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics (RSAA). Mount Wilson Observatory One of the most famous observatories in the world, located in the San Gabriel range near Pasadena, California, at an elevation of 1740 m (5700 ft). It was founded in 1904 as Mount Wilson Solar Observatory by George Ellery HALE , using funds from the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the SNOW TELE - SCOPE for solar spectroscopy was installed the following y ear. Mount Wilson was developed as a site for stellar astronomy with the completion of a 1.5-m (60-in.) reflec- tor by George W. RITCHEY in 1907. It was followed in 1917 by the 2.54-m (100-in.) HOOKER TELESCOPE , which dominated US astronomy until the completion of the HALE TELESCOPE at P alomar Observatory in 1948. This w as the instrument Edwin HUBBLE used in 1919 to identi- fy CEPHEID VARIABLE stars in the Andromeda Galaxy, and for subsequent work that led to the realization that the Universe is expanding. In 1917 the word ‘Solar’ was dropped from the observatory’s name. T oday, Mount Wilson remains part of the CARNEGIE OBSERVATORIES . Although seriously affected by the lights of Los Angeles, 32 km (20 mi) to the south-west, the observatory has entered a new era with the installation of Georgia State University’s CHARA Telescope Array. CHARA, the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy, consists of a Y-shaped arrangement of five 1-m (39-in.) telescopes within a 400-m (quarter-mile) radius linked interferometrically. It is possible that the Hooker and 60-inch telescopes will be incorporated into the array. moving cluster MOVING GROUPS of stars close enough to have their distance determined by the moving cluster parallax method, as follows. If the moving cluster is close to Earth, then projecting the spatial motions of the stars backwards will produce a set of paths that converge at one point. The direction of this convergent point is parallel to the space motion of the cluster. Observing individual stars within the cluster will gi ve a value for the P ARALLAX and hence the distance of the system. This is known as the moving cluster parallax method of distance determination. Using: v r = v cos \u0003 and v t = v sin \u0003 = 4.74 \u0004\u0005\u0006 where v is the SPACE VELOCITY , v r is RADIAL VELOCITY and v t is the T ANGENTIAL VELOCITY in km/s; \u0004 is the PROPER MOTION in arcseconds per year; and \u0006 is the parallax in arcseconds. Measuring the radial velocity of individual stars and the angle \u0003 to the convergent point gives a value for the space velocity and hence the tangential velocity. The proper motion of the individual stars then gives an idea of the parallax of the cluster. The moving cluster parallax method has been used to determine the distances of several nearby OPEN CLUSTERS . The proximity of these clusters allows distances to be cal- culated with a high precision. The HYADES in particular is often used as the main calibrator of the distance scale of the Universe. moving group Group of stars that share the same motion through space, and have the same age and similar chemical compositions. Moving groups can be in many forms, including OPEN CLUSTERS , GLOBULAR CLUSTERS , OB ASSOCIATIONS and T ASSOCIATIONS . If they lie close enough to Earth for the spatial motions of the individual stars to be determined, they are termed MOVING CLUSTERS and the cluster distance can be determined by the moving cluster parallax method.

When discovered by Antonín Mrkós (1918–96) from Czechoslovakia, the comet was one day past its perihelion (distance 0.35 AU). Closest approach to Earth came on August 13, and Comet Mrkós reached a peak magnitude \u0001 1.0 early in the month, with a dust tail extending for about 5º. The ion tail showed considerable activity, the sunspot cycle at this time being close to maximum. The orbit is elliptical, with a period of 13,200 years. M star Any member of a class of orange-red stars, the spectra of which are defined by molecular absorption bands of metallic oxides, particularly titanium oxide. V anadium oxide is present in addition to some hydrides and water. Hydrogen is very weak and disappears towards cooler subclasses. Neutral calcium is strong; its w eakening with increasing luminosity helps to determine the MK class. Only classes L and T are cooler than M stars. Main-sequence subclasses range from 2000 K at M9.5 to 3900 K at M0; zero-age masses range from the h ydrogen-fusing limit near 0.08 solar mass to 0.5; zero- age luminosities range from 2 3 1024 to half solar (most of the radiation emerging in the infrared). Lifetimes far exceed that of the Galaxy. Long lifetimes and high rates of low-mass star formation make M stars numerous. Ignoring classes L and T (whose populations are not yet assessed), class M contains 70% of all dwarf stars (none are visible to the naked eye). The convective envelopes of cool dwarfs extend more deeply as mass decreases, and at 0.3 solar mass (class M5) they reach the stellar centres, forcing cool M stars below about 3000 K to be completely mixed. Despite slow rota- tion, the deep convective zones somehow produce stellar magnetic fields and Sun-like activity. A good fraction of M dwarfs (dMe stars) display chromospheric emission and powerful flares that can brighten the stars by one or more magnitudes and that radiate across the spectrum. No giant or supergiant is cooler than class M. Having evolved from dwarfs of classes G to O, such stars are much more massive than M dwarfs. As a result of lower densities, giant surface temperatures are somewhat cooler than their dwarf counterparts. M giants divide into those with quiet helium cores that are climbing the giant branch for the first time, and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars with quiet carbon–oxygen cores that are climbing it for the second time. First-ascent M giants have early sub- types and can reach luminosities of 1000 times solar and radii of 100 times solar. Second-ascent giants can reach into later subtypes, and become brighter (over 10,000 solar) and larger, with the more massive rivalling the diameter of Mars’ orbit. The brighter AGB stars pulsate as Mira variables, changing by five or more visual magnitudes over periods that range from 100 to 1000 days. Much of the visual va ri a tion is caused by small temperature variations that send the radiation into the infrared and create more powerful obscuring TiO bands. Bolometric (true lumi- nosity) variation is much less, at about a magnitude. The pulsations create running shock waves, which generate emission lines, rendering Miras a class of me star. When M giants dredge the by-products of nuclear fusion (including carbon) to their surfaces, they become s stars and then carbon stars. Pulsations, plus the large lumi- nosities and radii, promote powerful winds and mass- loss rates of 1025 solar masses (or more) per year. Silicate dust condenses in the winds of M class Miras; carbon dust condenses in the winds of carbon stars. The winds of class M Miras create vast envelopes that can radiate powerful OH maser emission, whence they are known as OH/IR (infrared) stars. Among lower luminosity giants are found ‘semi-regu- lar’ (SR) variables. SRa stars (S Aquilae, R Ursae Minoris) are similar to Miras but exhibit smaller light vari- a tions and irregularities in their periods. SRb stars (R Lyrae, W Orionis) have periods that are less well defined. ‘Lb’ (irregular) M giants have no periods at all. The most luminous M supergiants develop from main- sequence O stars of up to 60 solar masses, most fusing helium in their cores. Bolometric luminosities can reach 750,000 times that of the Sun. Radii can approach 2000 times solar, rivalling the diameter of Saturn’s orbit (nearly 10 AU). Many M supergiants are irregular (Lc) variables. betelgeuse (M2 Iab), for example, varies with a range of about half a magnitude on a timescale of years. Some of the lesser M supergiants (SRc stars) display some semi- regular periodicity. Prominent examples of M stars include Proxima Cen- tauri M5 V, Betelgeuse M2 Iab, Antares M1.5 Ib, Mu Cephei M2 Ia, VV Cephei and M2 Iaep 1 O8 Ve.

Radio astronomy at Cambridge dates back to the earliest days of the science just after World War II, and flourished under the direc- tion of Martin R YLE from 1945 to 1982. The first Cam- bridge radio telescopes were built on the western outskirts of the city and specialized in the study of ‘radio stars’, sources now known to range from relatively near- by supernova remnants to the most distant galaxies. Whereas early work at JODRELL BANK OBSERVATORY led to the development of large single dishes, the emphasis at Cambridge was on the design and construction of smaller, widely spaced aerials used as an interferometer to make better positional measurements. In 1957, through the generosity of Mullard Ltd and with support from the Science Research Council, the MRAO was built on its present site at Lords Bridge, 8 km (5 mi) south-west of Cambridge. Today its instruments include the R YLE TELESCOPE (formerly the Five-Kilometre T elescope, dating from 1972), the CAMBRIDGE OPTICAL APERTURE SYNTHESIS TELESCOPE and the CAMBRIDGE LOW - FREQUENCY SYNTHESIS TELESCOPE . In the 1990s the obser- va tory built the Cosmic Anisotropy Telescope (CAT) at Cambridge as a prototype instrument for ground-based mapping of the cosmic microwave background radiation. 273 M \u0001 moving cluster The velocity of stars in an open cluster can be determined if they are close enough for their parallax to be measurable over a short period. Their parallax is combined with their line-of- sight rate of motion towards or away from Earth to obtain their speed of movement at right angles to the line of sight. Combined with the measurement of the angle of movement, this allows astronomers to judge their distances. stars in cluster convergent point Sun star v v r V t \u0002 \u0002 p p M AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 6:49 pm Page 273"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"In 2000 its successor, the VERY SMALL ARRAY , was installed on the island of Tenerife in the Canaries.

The similarity between multiple stars and star clusters suggests that they form in similar ways, that is, by conden- sation from interstellar clouds. A good example of this is the TRAPEZIUM in the ORION NEBULA . The Trapezium consists of four very young stars enmeshed in nebulosity, with a further five possible members nearby. The Trapez- ium is the prototype of a special type of quadruple star in which very little relative motion is observed. It may be that the stars will spend most of their lifetimes in this configu- ration. Many other examples of Trapezium-type systems are known. In hierarchical quadruple systems, the most common situation is two pairs revolving about each other, as, for example, in EPSILON LYRAE . The point at which highly multiple stars and star clus- ters overlap is not clear, but systems such as CASTOR and Alpha 2 Capricorni, with six components each, are still regarded as multiple stars. In these systems there is a rec- ognized hierarchy or order. In Castor, for instance, the two main pairs rotate about a common centre of gravity, whilst a pair of cool red dwarfs rotates about the same centre, but at a much larger distance. mural quadrant Early instrument used for measuring declination. It consists of a graduated circle fixed to a wall (in Latin, murus ) orientated north–south. A telescope (or, in early versions, a simple sighting tube) is mounted cen- trally on a pivot so that its position can be read off the cir- cle. The eyepiece of the telescope contains a horizontal gr a ticule along which the image of the star must move as the Earth turns. Setting of the telescope must be done quickly, as the star passes the meridian. It was superseded in the mid-19th century by the TRANSIT CIRCLE .

Narlikar was educated at Cambridge University, where Hoyle was his advisor; later, they collaborated on a theory of ‘self-gravitating systems’ that explains the formation of astronomical objects ranging in size from a few kilometres to about 1 million l.y. Narlikar proposed a ‘quasi-steady-state’ model that takes into account recent findings on the anisotropic distribution of matter in space.

The most advanced astronomy, of comparable sophistication to anything the Old World could offer despite their complete isolation from Europe and Asia, was possessed by the Maya of Central America, whose empire spread from the Yucatán Peninsula to cover other parts of modern Mexico, Guatemala and Belize and was at its height c . AD 300–900. Significantly, the Maya also had the best- developed mathematics in the New World. Some knowledge of their astronomy comes from a ‘bark book’ known as the Dresden Codex, written in hieroglyphics. Like most other indigenous American cultures, the Maya placed great importance on the motions of Venus and the Pleiades. The Maya had an intricate system of interlocking calendars. One was based on a year of 365 days, with 18 months of 20 days each (20 was the base of their number-system) and a special period of five ‘unlucky’ days. Another ‘year’ was based on 360 days and a third sacred year had 260 days with 13 subdivisions of 20 named days each. An almanac in the Dresden Codex covers the cycles of its apparent revolutions with great precision. They also had some knowledge of the cycle of solar eclipses, though they were not able to predict their actual occurrence with certainty, only being able to give days on which eclipses might occur. There is evidence of astronomy having been practised by other American cultures, though none reached the heights of the Mayan. Extensive systems of lines centred on the Inca Temple of the Sun display astronomical alignments, and huge pre-Inca figures marked in the desert at Nazca have some astronomical significance. Many other structures in South, Central and North America – for example the Medicine Wheel stone circle in Wyoming – also display astronomical alignments. The Aztecs’ astronomy was largely bound up with ritual and sacrifice. In common with other city- cultures, including the Maya and the Toltec, they pictured a layered comos, the Earth occupying the lowest level and the creator the uppermost. nautical twilight See TWILIGHT navigational astronomy Use of astronomical observations to determine the geographical position of a N National Astronomical Observatory of Japan 276 \u0001 near-Earth asteroid The inner Solar System is swarming with small, rocky bodies.

It is now largely of historical interest thanks to the GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) of navigational satellites. The need for celestial navigation arose with the ever- increasing distances travelled by European seafarers from the 15th century onwards. Latitude was easy enough to determine by observing the altitude of Polaris (or that of the Sun) and consulting tables giving its declination for a gi v en date. Simple instruments such as the CROSS - STAFF , QU ADRANT and ASTROLABE w ere used for this purpose. The determination of longitude depended on having accurate time available. Various methods, such as tables of the Moon’s position among the stars or observations of Jupiter’s satellites, were proposed for determining time at sea. However, they depended on the ability to predict positions with sufficient accuracy. An additional difficulty was that the observations required for comparison with positions in the tables were by no means easy to make on a rolling and pitching ship. The development of the MARINE CHRONOMETER in the 18th century and the annual publication of The Nautical Almanac in Britain from 1766 eventually made possible the determination of longitude at sea. Time signals derived from transit observations were provided at va r ious ports so that chronometers could be accurately set and checked. Radio time signals became common in the 1920s and 1930s, thus removing the need for independent timekeeping except at times of war; navigators on naval ships and military aircraft received training in ‘astronavigation’. Further developments based on radio techniques were the Loran, Decca and Omega systems, which involved (in essence) timing the radio transmissions from fixed transmitters, multiplying by the speed of light to get the distances and plotting the result on a chart to get the position. n-body problem See MANY - BODY PROBLEM NEA See NEAR - EARTH ASTEROID neap tide Low-level high TIDES that occur when the directions of the Sun and Moon are at a right angle.

By analogy with the classes of orbit that comprise the near- earth asteroids, the criterion for an NEO is that the perihelion distance be less than 1.3 AU. It is usual, though, to regard NEOs as including only those objects with smaller perihelia, making very close approaches to the Earth (and possibly impacts) feasible in the near term. near-infrared Region of the electromagnetic spectrum between around 0.75 and 5 \u0001 m. Near-infrared radiation can be observed from the ground at good dry sites, except for a few narrow regions that are absorbed by water vapour and carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere. Many objects, including stars, emit strongly in this range, and there are important atomic and molecular features present, notably due to hydrogen.

NEAT Acronym for Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking, an asteroid research programme based at the JET PROPULSION LABORATORY in Pasadena, California, USA. Several comets discovered in this project have been given the name NEAT. nebula Celestial object that appears larger and fuzzier than a star. Originally the term was used for any such object, but it is now restricted to those objects that are clouds of gas and dust and so cannot be resolved into stars. Most EMISSION NEBULAE emit their light in a series of EMISSION LINES . In these nebulae the atoms are ionized by ultraviolet radiation from a hot star or stars, and the visible light is emitted as the electrons are recaptured. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in almost all nebulae, and because it is ionized such nebulae are called HII REGIONS . Hydrogen gives off its strongest light in the red at 656 nm, thus HII regions often appear red on images; however, they can appear greenish when seen visually because of a prominent pair of FORBIDDEN LINES at 496 and 501 nm emitted by oxygen. If the star exciting an emission nebula is very hot, such that most of its radiation is in the ultravi- olet, the nebula can appear much brighter than the star, since it processes the ultraviolet radiation to visible light. Although looking bright and almost solid, emission nebu- lae are very tenuous. Typically every kilogram of material is spread over a volume of a thousand million cubic kilo- metres. Nebulae that are SUPERNOVA REMNANTS often emit SYNCHROTRON RADIATION ; this is usually in the radio region, but in a few cases, like the CRAB NEBULA , it can extend into the visible. Some nebulae are seen because they scatter starlight. In this case we see not the gas itself but the myriad tiny motes of dust that normally are mixed with it. The dust is lit up like smoke in sunlight. These REFLECTION NEBULAE are always fainter than the star that illuminates them, unless a denser portion of the nebula hides the star from us. Reflection nebulae generally appear blue on images. D ARK NEBULAE , such as the COALSACK , are not lit by any star, thus they can be seen only when silhouetted against something brighter.

In 1755 the philosopher Immanuel KANT published his Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens , in which he suggested that the Sun and planets condensed out of diffuse primordial matter under the attraction of gravity. A similar theory was developed independently and in g reater detail by Pierre Simon LAPLACE in his Exposition du systeme du monde (1796). He envisioned that the Sun originally had an extended hot atmosphere throughout the volume of the Solar System. As this cooled and contracted, it spun more rapidly and threw off a series of gaseous rings; the planets condensed from this material. A similar process on a smaller scale supposedly produced satellites from contracting planets. This nebular hypothesis offered explanations for some properties of the Solar System, including the nearly cir- cular and coplanar orbits of the planets, and their motion in the same direction as the Sun’s rotation. Some ele- ments of the nebular hypothesis are echoed in modern theories of planetary formation, but most have been superseded.

The T Tauri stars (classified as INT) vary irregularly in brightness, whereas the FU Orionis stars (FU) exhibit a single brightening, possibly as they assume a stable state. Nebular variables are F-, G- or K-type giant stars, many still surrounded by wa rm cocoons of dust and gas. There are a great number in the ORION NEBULA . While contracting, nebular va r iables probably lose large amounts of material in the form of a stellar or T-Tauri wind. The rate of mass loss is about one-ten millionth of a solar mass per year.

It is the fourth largest (by diameter) and the third most massive planet. From 1979 to 1999 PLUTO , thanks to its eccentric orbit, w as nearer to the Sun than Neptune: during this period Neptune was thus the ninth and farthest known planet. At magnitude \u0001 7.8, Neptune is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye, and its discovery awaited the inven- tion of the telescope. After URANUS w as discovered by William HERSCHEL in 1781, its orbit was calculated in order to follow the planet’s motion. Before about 1820, however, Uranus was found to get ahead of its predicted position and after this to lag behind. It was suggested that this anomaly was a result of the gravitational influence of a unknown planet orbiting farther from the Sun. From observed irregularities in the motion of Uranus, the mathe- maticians John Couch ADAMS ,w orking in England, and Urbain LE VERRIER ,w orking independently in France, both predicted the location of the unseen planet. A comedy of errors and ineptitude prevented English astronomers fol- lowing up Adams’ predictions, and it was Le Verrier who eventually persuaded the German astronomer Johann GALLE in Berlin to search the region of the sky in which he had calculated that the new planet would lie. On 1846 Sep- tember 23, Galle and his student, Heinrich D ’ ARREST , located the new planet very close to the predicted position. Scholars have largely given joint credit for the discov- ery to Adams and Le Verrier because their predictions w ere based on a sound analysis of data and a thorough knowledge of gravitational theory. At least, this was the sit- uation for 134 years. In 1980, however, the astronomical w orld was astonished when an astronomer and Galileo scholar announced that Galileo himself had first seen Neptune with his telescope in 1613 January, some 233 y ears before it was identified by Galle. It was not recog- nized as a planet: Galileo’s sketches showed its apparent motion, but his interest was concentrated on Jupiter and the satellites and so the discovery was delayed. Although Neptune is sometimes described as a ‘jov- ian’ planet, its resemblance to JUPITER and SATURN is superficial. Neptune is, however, quite similar to Uranus in many ways, including diameter, composition and mass. Seen through the telescope, both planets are nearly featureless, in strong contrast to the abundant cloud structures on Jupiter and the banded appearance of Sat- N Neptune 279 76-0304 \u0001 Neptune In 1989 Voyager 2 imaged Neptune’s rings.

While Uranus is a faint greenish colour, Neptune is weakly tinted blue. The atmosphere of Neptune shows faint bands rather like those of Jupiter and Saturn. The bands are not easily seen from Earth as the planet appears so small, subtending only 2 \u0001 .5. The planet is composed mainly of molecular h ydrogen and helium, with a small silicate and metallic core. The atmosphere is primarily methane and other h ydrocarbons. During its 1989 encounter, VOYA GER 2 identified several dark spots, the largest of which was called the ‘Great Dark Spot’, though recent images from the Hubble Space Telescope show that it has now disappeared. There was also a bright, fast-moving spot, referred to as the ‘Scooter’. Whether these spots have dissipated or faded is not known. Also identified were bands of light-coloured cirrus cloud, which from the shadows cast appeared to be some 50–100 km (30–60 mi) higher than the tops of the main cloud belts. The overall haziness of the atmosphere may be anti-correlated with the sunspot cycle, in that at times of maximum solar activity Neptune appears in our telescopes to be a little fainter than average, while at sunspot minimum it is brighter. The Sun’s activity thus appears to influence the atmosphere of Neptune, some 4500 million km (2800 million mi) away, by the formation of a global haze affecting the apparent brightness of the planet as seen from Earth. However, a recent analysis of brightness observations of Neptune and also Uranus does not support this view in the long term. By following the motions of the cloud top features, Vo y ager 2 and Earth-based astronomers (observing in the infrared) have measured the period of the planet’s rota- tion. These measurements give periods in the region of about 17.7 hours for the rotation of the upper atmos- phere. From radio emissions, Voyager 2 determined a rotation period of 16 hours and 7 minutes for the planet. Being a GAS GIANT , Neptune has only a small solid core, which is thought to be of silicon, iron and other met- als. The bulk of the planet is largely composed of hydrogen and helium, which under the temperature and pressure act as supercooled liquids. Neptune’s mean density is 1.64 g/cm 3 , which is somewhat higher than the other gas g iants. Convection currents in the mantle carry heat up from the core region. As Neptune continues to contract, because of its own strong gravitational field, and as the constituents of the mantle gradually differentiate, with the heavier molecules settling to the bottom, energy is liberated from the planet. This energy is emitted as excess heat. The temperature in the stratosphere at the 100 mbar pressure level was measured to be 55 K, though the temperature predicted on the basis of Neptune’s distance from the Sun and other parameters is a few degrees cooler. Voyager 2 also identified a weak magnetic field, inclined at 47º to the rotation axis, radio emissions, aurorae and radiation belts. Neptune has eight known satellites, the brightest of which, TRITON , was discovered by William LASSELL short- ly after Neptune’s discovery was announced. The others are much fainter. Nereid was discovered in 1949, with a further six identified during Voyager’s flyby. Analysis of observations during stellar occultations by Neptune sug- gested that several ring arcs surrounded the planet, and Vo y ager 2 imaged several rings of varying intensity. Four obvious rings were detected, with ring particles found in much of the space in between. Nereid Second satellite of NEPTUNE to be discovered, by Gerard Kuiper in 1949. It is about 340 km (210 mi) in size. Despite being slightly smaller than PROTEUS , Nereid w as discovered telescopically long before any of the inner Neptunian satellites were spotted (in VOYA GER 2 images), because of its much greater distance from the glare of the planet. Nereid takes 360 days to orbit Neptune, at an av erage distance of 5.51 million km (3.42 million mi) from the planet’s centre. It has an unusual orbit, with a low inclination (near 7º) and the highest eccentricity of all known planetary satellites (0.751), indicating that Nereid is likely a captured body, previously a CENTAUR or a TRANS - NEPTUNIAN OBJECT . Nereus APOLLO ASTEROID discovered by Eleanor Helin in 1982; number 4660. Nereus is a prime candidate for future visits by space probes because of its low speed relative to the Earth. Its name reflects this fact: it is ‘near us’ in terms of accessibility, if not distance. See table at NEAR - EARTH ASTEROID neutral point P osition between two bodies where their gr a vitational pulls are equal in strength; the neutral point is closer to the less massive body. neutrino astronomy Study of bodies in the Universe via their emission of neutrinos. The neutrino is an electrically neutral subatomic parti- cle whose existence was first suggested in 1930 by the Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli (1900–1958) in order to account for the apparent non-conservation of energy in \u0002 -decays. The neutrino was required to take away a vary- ing amount of excess energy during the reactions in an (almost) undetectable manner, so that the total energy released remained constant. The neutrino was discovered experimentally in 1955 by the American physicists Clyde Cowan Jnr (1919– ) and Frederick Reines (1918– ). Its interaction with other forms of matter is indeed weak: of all the neutrinos produced at the centre of the Sun, 99.99% escape without any contact with other particles during their 700,000 km (400,000 mi) journey to the Sun’s surface. There are now known to be three varieties of neutrino, together with their antiparticles. The original neutrino is associated with normal electrons and is called the electron-neutrino. The other two neutrinos are associ- a ted with the heavy electrons (leptons) known as muons and tau particles and so are named muon-neutrinos and tau-neutrinos. It has recently been shown experimentally that one type of neutrino can metamorphose into another. This is of great significance for the SOLAR NEUTRINO problem and also implies that neutrinos have a mass, albeit perhaps only a millionth that of a normal electron. Neutrinos from space are detected in two main ways, either through their taking part in nuclear reactions, or by their collisions with other particles. The first detector start- ed operating in 1968 and continues to this day. Devised by the American chemist Raymond Davis, Jr (1916– ), it operates by detecting the radioactive decay of argon-37. The argon-37 is produced by a neutrino interacting with chlorine-37, and so each decay corresponds to a neutrino capture. The detector is a tank containing 600 tonnes of tetrachloroethene; it is buried 1.5 km (0.9 mi) below g round at the HOMESTAKE MINE in Dakota in order to shield it from unwanted interactions. Two other detectors, SAGE (in the Caucasus) and GALLEX (in Italy), detect neutrinos in a similar fashion, but based upon the conver- sion by a neutrino of gallium-71 to radioactive germani- um-71. The second class of detectors operates by detecting the C ˇ ERENKOV RADIATION from high energy elec- trons in water. The electrons result either from inverse beta decay, in which a neutrino and proton convert to a neutron and positron (positive electron), or gain their energy by direct collision between the neutrino and an electron. The wa ter for this class of detectors is either contained in large tanks buried underground, as at IMB (the Irvine Michigan Brookhaven experiment) in the USA, Super-Kamiokande in Japan and SNO (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory) in Canada; or is a part of the ocean, for example DUMAND (Deep Undersea Muon and Neutrino Detection) in the P acific Ocean and NESTOR in the Mediterranean Sea; or is part of the Antarctic icecap, for example the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA). Neutrinos are expected to be produced in many reac- tions, but to date have only been detected from three astronomical sources. The first is from the core of the Sun, where two neutrinos result from the formation of a helium nucleus ( see NUCLEOSYNTHESIS ); the second is from the 1987 SUPERNOVA in the Large Magellanic Cloud; and the third is as a result of COSMIC RAY interactions with nuclei at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere. The potential importance of neutrinos, however, lies in their ability to N Nereid 280 \u0001 Nereid Neptune’s outermost satellite was discovered in 1949 by Gerard Kuiper. The most detailed images of it were obtained by V oyager 2 from a distance of 4.7 million km (2.9 million mi). planetary orbit T riton Nereid \u0002 Neptune Among Neptune’s eight known satellites are some of the largest planetary satellites. Triton, which was discovered only a few days after the planet itself, orbits in a retrograde direction. Nereid is farther out has a highly elliptical orbit.

The British physicist Sir James Chadwick (1891–1974) discovered the neutron in 1932. Inside a nucleus it is stable, but as an independent particle it decays with a half-life of about 12 minutes to a proton, electron and anti-neutrino. Its mass is 1.674929 \u0001 10 \u0002 27 kg (1.008793 amu). neutron star Densest and tiniest star known, composed of DEGENERATE MATTER and supported by neutron degeneracy pressure. Neutron stars are the end points of stars whose mass after nuclear burning is greater than the CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT for white dwarfs, but whose mass is not great enough to overcome the neutron degeneracy pressure to become BLACK HOLES . The neutron, which along with the proton makes up the atomic nucleus, was discovered in 1932. At the end of 1933 Walter BAADE and Fritz ZWICKY tentatively suggested that in SUPERNOVA explosions, ordinary stars are turned into stars that consist of extremely closely packed neutrons. They called these stars neutron stars. Neutron stars were thought to be too faint to be detectable and little work was done on them until 1967 November, when Franco Pacini (1939– ) pointed out that if the neutron stars were spinning and had large magnetic fields, then electromagnetic waves would be emitted. Unbeknown to him, radio astronomer Antony HEWISH and his research assistant Jocelyn Bell (see BELL BURNELL ) at Cambridge were shortly to detect radio pulses from stars that are now believed to be highly magnetized, rapid- ly spinning neutron stars, known as PULSARS . Any star with an initial main-sequence mass of around 10 solar masses or above has the potential to become a neutron star. As the star evolves away from the main sequence, subsequent nuclear burning produces an iron- r ich core. When all nuclear fuel in the core has been exhausted, the core must be supported by degeneracy pressure alone. Further deposits of material from shell bu r ning cause the core to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Electron degeneracy pressure is overcome and the core collapses further, sending temperatures soaring to over 5 billion K. At these temperatures, photodisintegration (the breaking up of iron nuclei into alpha particles by high- energy gamma rays) occurs. As the temperature climbs even higher, electrons and protons combine to form neu- trons, releasing a flood of neutrinos. When densities reach nuclear density of 4 \u0001 10 17 kg/m 3 , neutron degeneracy pressure halts the contraction. The infalling outer atmos- phere of the star is flung outwards and it becomes a Type II or Type Ib supernova. The remnant left is a neutron star. If it has a mass greater than about 2–3 solar masses, it collapses further to become a BLACK HOLE . Other neutron stars are formed within CLOSE BINARIES . The surface of the neutron star is made of iron. In the presence of a strong magnetic field the atoms of iron poly- merize. The polymers pack to form a lattice with density about ten thousand times that of terrestrial iron and strength a million times that of steel. It has excellent electri- cal conductivity along the direction of the magnetic field, b ut is a good insulator perpendicular to this direction. Immediately beneath this surface the neutron star is still solid, but its composition is changing. Larger nuclei, par- ticularly rich in neutrons, are formed, and materials that on Earth would be radioactive are stable in this environment, for example nickel-62. With increasing depth the density r ises. When it reaches 400 thousand million times that of wa ter the nuclei can get no larger and neutrons start ‘drip- ping’ out. As the density goes up further the nuclei dissolve in a sea of neutrons. The neutron fluid is a superfluid – it has no viscosity and no resistance to flow or movement. Within a few kilometres of the surface the density has reached the density of the atomic nucleus. Up to this point the properties of matter are reasonably well understood, but beyond it understanding becomes increasingly sketchy. The composition of the core of the star is particularly uncertain: it may be liquid or solid; it may consist of other nuclear par- ticles (pions, for example, or hyperons); and there may be another phase change, where QU ARKS start ‘dripping’ out of the neutrons, forming another liquid. A neutron star has a mass comparable to that of the Sun, but as it is only about 10 km (6 mi) in radius, it has an average density 1000 million million times that of wa ter. Such a large mass in such a small volume pro- duces an intense gravitational force: objects weigh 100,000 million times more on the surface of a neutron N neutron star 281 \u0001 neutrino astronomy When operating, neutrino detectors such as the Super-Kamiokande in Japan contain exceptionally pure water. Because neutrinos themselves are so difficult to detect most instruments search instead for radiation and decay particles resulting from collisions between the neutrinos and atoms in the water. \u0002 neutron star A hot X-ray source within the supernova r emnant IC443 is thought to be the neutron star created in the explosion.

The intense gravi- tational field affects light and other electromagnetic radi- a tion emitted by the star, producing significant redshift ( z approximately equal to 0.2). The strong gravitational attraction allows neutron stars to spin rapidly (hundreds of revolutions per second) without disintegrating. Such spin rates are expected if the core of the original star collapses without loss of angular momentum. If the original star has a magnetic field, then this too may be conserved and concentrated in the col- lapse to a neutron star. Pulsars, GAMMA - RAY BURST sources, and the neutron stars in some X - RAY BINARIES are believed to have magnetic fields of strength about 100 million Tesla (roughly a million million times the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field). There are thought to be of the order of 10 8 neutron stars in the Galaxy, but they can only be easily detected in certain instances, such as if they are a pulsar or part of a binary system. Non-rotating and non-accreting neutron stars are virtually undetectable, but the Hubble Space T elescope has observed one thermally radiating neutron star (RX J185635-3754). Its surface temperature is 6 \u0001 10 5 K and its radius 12–13 km (7.5–8 mi). Neutron star mergers may produce gamma-ray bursts. Newall Telescope Refractor of 0.63 m (25 in.) aper- ture built by Thomas Cooke & Sons for amateur observer Robert Stirling Newall (1812–89) of Gateshead, England. Completed in 1869, it was for a while the world’s largest refractor; it is now in Greece, and is operated by the National Observatory of Athens. Newcomb, Simon (1835–1909) American mathemati- cal astronomer, born in Canada, who calculated highly accurate values for astronomical constants and tables of the motions of the Moon and planets and was the most influential astronomer of his day. In 1861 he became pro- fessor of mathematics at the US NAVAL OBSERVATORY (USNO), Washington. Studying the orbits of asteroids, he proved that they could not have originated from the break-up of a single body, a once-popular theory. New- comb began a lifelong study of the Moon’s motion. His results suggested that the discrepancy between the Moon’s calculated and observed motion was caused by a g radual slowing of the Earth’s rotation; this was finally proved by others, including E.W. BROWN . F our years later, Newcomb became superintendent of the US Nautical Almanac Office, where he set about refining the orbits of the planets, using observations dating back to 1750. This was a major feat of celestial mechanics, carried out with the collaboration of E.W. Brown, G.W. HILL and others. The work required an accurate value of the SOLAR PARALLAX ( \u0002 ), which Newcomb had begun wo rking towards some years before. To this end he observed the 1874 and 1882 transits of Venus, but decid- ed that ultimately the accuracy of \u0002 depended on having an accurate value of c , the speed of light, to measure which he devised a method based on that of Léon FOUCAULT . He also established that the discrepancy between the observed and calculated values of the advance of Mercury’s perihe- lion was 43 \u0003 , exactly the difference later explained by the theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY . Newcomb’s planetary tables, published in 1899, remained in use until the 1950s. Equally enduring was his consistent system of refined astronomical constants, cal- culated jointly with Arthur Matthew Weld Downing (1850–1917) of the UK Nautical Almanac Office, and adopted worldwide in 1901.

At the suggestion of the Royal Astro- nomical Society, Dreyer combined what were then the three main catalogues of nebulae – John HERSCHEL ’s General Catalogue of Nebulae (which Dreyer had already revised, in 1879), and those of Heinrich D ’ ARREST and Lord R OSSE ; and supplemented the amalgamated listing with more recent observations by a number of other astronomers. The NGC, published in 1888, contains nearly 7840 non-stellar objects (including galaxies, although their real nature was not then known) and over 5000 more are listed in two subsequent INDEX CATA - LOGUES . Objects are still referred to by their NGC num- bers. A revision for the present epoch has been published as NGC 2000.0 (1988).

Most of his theories – on gravitation, light and calculus, for example – he developed in basic form while in his early twenties. In 1668 he built the first reflecting tele- scope in order to avoid the chromatic aberration inherent in lenses. In 1684, urged by Edmond Halley, he began w ork on Principia (1687), in which he put forward his law of gravitation and laws of motion, and showed how gravi- tation explained Kepler’s laws. In his Opticks (1704) he set out his theories of light, including how white light is made up of the colours of the spectrum. Newton’s greatest math- ematical achievement was his invention of calculus. Born prematurely at Woolsthorpe, a hamlet near Grantham, Lincolnshire, three months after his father’s death, Newton was left in the care of his grandmother, during which time his mother married again. Hating his stepfather, Newton suffered all his life from a sense of insecurity; it was this that later in life made him abnormal- ly sensitive to criticism of his scientific work. When his stepfather died, Newton’s mother determined that he should become a farmer and manage her estates, but he showed no interest in such a career, and she was persuad- ed to allow him to be prepared for university. In 1661 Newton entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a subsizar – an impoverished undergraduate who performed menial tasks to help pay for his keep. Newton graduated in 1665 April, having already invented his mathematical method of fluxions, though few people were aware of the fact. However, the university was then closed because of the plague and the scholars dis- persed. Newton went back to Woolsthorpe where, except for a return for a couple of months to Cambridge, he con- solidated his mathematical work and his nascent optical theory of the nature of colour. He also recognized that each planet was held in its orbit by a force emanating from the Sun which diminished according to the square of its distance – an inverse-square law. But he published nothing. By 1671 Newton had built his first reflecting telescope ( see NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE ). At the time all telescopes w ere refractors, forming their image with a lens, not a mir- ror. To avoid CHROMATIC ABERRATION and to provide good sharp images, lenses had to be of very long focal length, making telescopes equally as long and thus very cumber- some. Newton’s theory that white light is a mixture of the light of all colours persuaded him (wrongly) that the refrac- tor could not be cured of this defect. He therefore designed a reflecting telescope – the first successful one ever to be made and it aroused much interest; not only was it free from chromatic aberration, but it was far shorter than any refractor. A duplicate instrument was sent to the Royal N Newall Telescope 282 N AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 6:56 pm Page 282"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Society in London at their request, and Newton was promptly elected a Fellow. At his own suggestion he then submitted a paper on his theory of light and colour. This historic paper was criticized, and the ensuing controversy severely upset him, though in 1675 he did submit two other optical papers. One was about the colours seen in very thin films of oil and other materials, the other on his theory that light was composed of tiny particles, or ‘corpuscles’. These also caused controversy, and in the end, Newton shut him- self away in Cambridge and shunned further publication. Not until late in 1679 did his resume correspondence, with Robert Hooke, Honorary Secretary to the Royal Society and previously a severe critic of Newton’s theories of light and colour. An exchange of letters led Newton to re-examine his work on planetary orbits, but again he published nothing; not until 1684 was he stimulated to consider making his ideas known. This was the result of a visit from Edmond HALLEY . In London, Halley had been discussing the problem with Hooke and with the astronomer-architect Christo- pher Wren (1632–1723). No one had been able prove mathematically that an inverse-square law would result in elliptical planetary orbits, and Halley decided to visit Newton and ask him whether he knew the reason. New- ton replied that he did, and had a mathematical proof. Unable to locate it among his papers, he promised to con- v ey it to Halley later. This he did, sending a small tract with the title De motu (‘On Motion’). When Halley received it, he was mathematician enough to realize that here was a document of the greatest significance. He therefore prevailed on the Royal Society to publish an entire book on the subject by Newton, and also persuaded Newton to continue expanding his ideas for publication. There were difficulties, however. On the one hand the Royal Society was short of money and could not afford to publish; Halley himself had to edit the manuscript and pay the printer out of his own pocket. On the other hand, Hooke raised objections, claiming that Newton had stolen his results. Newton was furious – he went through his text deleting nearly every reference to Hooke, and refused to complete the book. It took all of Halley’s undoubted diplo- matic gifts to save the situation, and at last, in 1687 July, the volume appeared with the title Philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica (‘The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy’). The book, known by its shortened name, PRINCIPIA , was a tour de force , one of the most impor- tant scientific works ever written. It not only solved virtual- ly all the questions and problems of traditional astronomy, b ut stimulated a vast amount of further research. Newton was exhausted after this vast intellectual effort, and seems to have suffered a nervous breakdown. He withheld publication of his Opticks and his acceptance of the presidency of the Royal Society until after Hooke’s death, and did no more major scientific work. Thereafter he spent his time researching biblical chronology and practising alchemy, as well as seeking public preferment. He was appointed Warden of the Mint in 1696 to take charge of a great recoinage scheme; later he became Mas- ter of the Mint. This work he carried out with outstanding ability, and was knighted in 1705 in recognition of his exceptional service. Newton’s later years were darkened by two major con- troversies. The first was over the publication of the obser- va tions of John FLAMSTEED , which he persuaded Halley to edit; the other was a priority dispute over the invention of calculus. Newton had expanded his fluxions into the tech- nique now known to have been discovered independently by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). Newton was encouraged by others to accuse Leibniz of stealing his ideas, and the controversy became very bitter, pursued even after Leibniz’s death. By the end of his life not only was Newton considered the doyen of British science, but his reputation had become international. He died on 1727 March 20 in Lon- don, and was buried in Westminster Abbey following a state funeral. His achievements were so important for astronomy that the phrase ‘Newtonian revolution’ is often used. Indeed, his influence on the physical sciences was profound and long-lasting: physics was Newtonian physics until the arrival of RELATIVITY and QU ANTUM PHYSICS . Newton European Space Agency (ESA) X-Ray Multi- Mirror (XMM) telescope launched in 1999 December as the second Cornerstone Horizon 2000 science mission.

Before the rise of the Schmidt–Cassegrain telescope, the Newtonian was the reflector of choice for many amateur observers. Newton’s law of gravitation Law governing the mutual attraction between two masses that arises from the GRAVITATIONAL FORCE . In his Principia , published in 1687, Sir Isaac NEWTON announced that the force of gr a vity between any two masses, m 1 and m 2 , is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, r , between them: where G is the gravitational constant (= 6.6726 \u0001 10 \u0002 11 N m 2 kg \u0002 2 ). Although gravity is the weakest of the four forces (the others being the strong and weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic force), it operates at long range and there are no negative masses to counter-balance the effect of normal mass (in the way that positive and negative electric charges cancel out each others’ effects). Gravity is, therefore, the dominant force governing large scale phenomena within the Universe.

Nice Observatory See OBSERVATOIRE DE LA CÔTE D ’ AZUR Nicholson, Seth Barnes (1891–1963) American astronomer who spent his entire career at Mount Wilson Observatory, specializing in the planets, asteroids and comets. Nicholson discovered four faint satellites of Jupiter, and used a thermocouple device to measure the temperatures of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. He calculated an accurate temperature for sunspots, showing that they were cooler than the surrounding photosphere, and for the solar corona, showing that its 2 million K temperature was much hotter than the layers of the Sun’s atmosphere immediately below it. Nicholson’s precise measurements of the temperatures of giant stars in the solar neighbourhood allowed the first good estimates of those stars’ true diameters. Nicol prism Optical device used to polarize plane light and to analyse polarized light. Invented in 1828 by William Nicol (1768–1851), the prism consists of two pieces of calcite or Iceland Spar cemented together using Canada Balsam. When light enters the prism it undergoes double REFRACTION , that is, the light is split into an ordinary ray and an extraordinary ray, each having the opposite POLARIZATION to the other. The ordinary ray is reflected at the Canada Balsam surface, while the extraordinary ray passes straight through. Thus any light beam can be split into its two polarized components. Astronomers use Nicol prisms to measure the degree of polarization present in light from the object under study. nitrogen (symbol N) Element that in order of cosmic abundance is fifth by number of atoms and seventh in terms of the mass content of the Universe ( see ASTROCHEMISTRY ). Its properties include: atomic number 7; atomic mass of the naturally element 14.0067 amu; melting point 73.3 K; boiling point 77.4 K. It was discovered in 1772 by the Scottish chemist Daniel Rutherford (1749–1819), although several other chemists were close behind. Nitrogen has seven ISOTOPES , ranging from nitrogen-12 to nitrogen-18; two of these are stable and form the naturally occurring element (nitrogen-14, 99.6%, nitrogen-15, 0.4%). Nitrogen comprises 78.08% by volume of dry terrestri- al air (75.52% by mass). Under normal terrestrial condi- tions, it exists as a colourless, odourless gas formed of the diatomic molecule, N 2 , and is chemically unreactive because the bond between each pair of atoms is hard to break. It is also contained in a wide range of compounds, including ammonia (NH 3 ), and is an important con- stituent of many organic molecules and foodstuffs for liv- ing organisms. Atomic and ionized nitrogen are produced in the upper atmosphere by the action of solar radiation; they react with oxygen and ozone to produce nitric oxide. Sudden enhancements of atomic and ionized nitrogen, resulting from the impact of energetic particles from SOLAR FLARES , can therefore result in significant tempo- rary depletions of the terrestrial ozone layer. Apart from the Earth, the only Solar System body to possess a nitrogen-rich atmosphere is TITAN , the giant satellite of SATURN . Nitrogen makes up 94% by volume of Titan’s atmosphere. Nitrogen plays an important catalytic role in the CAR - BON – NITROGEN – OXYGEN CYCLE , which is the major heli- um-producing nuclear reaction in stars more massive than the Sun. A variant of the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle known as the CNO bi-cycle involves the capture of fur- ther PROTONS to produce nitrogen and helium as end products, and this process may have produced a large fraction of the cosmic abundance of nitrogen-14. Liquid nitrogen is widely employed to cool sensitive astronomical detectors in order to reduce unwanted background noise.

In the northern hemisphere, they are most often seen in late June and early July. Noctilucent clouds are believed to consist of water ice condensed on to small solid nuclei, probably of meteoric origin.

Nova Cygni 1975 (V1500 Cyg) had the exceptionally large amplitude of 19 magnitudes. The subsequent decline is much slower. Two subtypes are recognized on the basis of the time taken to fall 3 magnitudes from maximum: fast novae (NA) take less than 100 days; slow novae (NB) take 150 days or more. A further subtype (NC) shows both a slow rise (sometimes as long as a decade) and an extremely slow decline. The appearance of a bright star-like point of light in the sky over only a few nights of observation, at a posi- tion where previously no star had been known, was a matter of great interest in ancient times. The phenome- non tended to be ignored by European chroniclers dur- ing the Middle Ages because the prevailing culture belief w as that the heavens represented a perfect and therefore unchangeable creation by God. When change did in fact occur in the sky the matter was dealt with by ensuring that no written record of it was made. When astronomers today are concerned to know about what happened a thousand years ago they consult the records of cultures other than the European, notably of the Chi- nese ( see CHINESE ASTRONOMY ). The appearance of TYCHO ’ SSTAR and KEPLER ’ SSTAR (both actually SUPER - NOVAE ) in 1572 and 1604, respectively, were seminal events in bringing about a complete change in the Euro- pean conception of the heavens. Because astronomers nowadays have photographic plates of the whole sky on which even exceedingly faint stars may be seen, it is often possible to locate a nova’s precursor. An even greater amount of information may be obtained by following the spectral features of a nova through its sudden outburst into its decline over a time interval of weeks and months. The outcome of such inves- tigations is that novae are in the main, if not indeed whol- ly, WHITE DWARF stars that happen to be members of BINARY STAR systems, more specifically, that they are interacting binaries. Novae may be observed in galaxies other than our own, and attempts have been made to use such observations as an indicator of the distances of other nearby galaxies. The g reat majority of observed cases are within our own Galaxy, where for the limited region of the solar neigh- bourhood they are found to occur at a rate of about two per year. The solar neighbourhood is determined by the fogging effect of INTERSTELLAR DUST , which cuts down the range of effective observation to about 5% of the whole Galaxy, for which the rate of occurrence of novae is estimated to be about 40 per year. Our subjective perception of a nova is confined to light in the visual and photographic ranges of wavelength, omitting the ultraviolet. Because the ultraviolet is of vari- able importance, probably being of greater importance before outburst than during it, our subjective perception tends to exaggerate the contrast between the pre-nova state and the maximum emission of light during the out- bu r st. The observed contrast for visible light is usually about 10,000 to 1, but if all wavelengths were included the contrast would probably be about 100 to 1. The emission of visible light in the pre-nova stars is of a similar order to the emission from the Sun, whereas the emission at maximum outburst is of a similar order to that of a supergiant star of type F8, of which Wezen, the fourth-brightest star in the constellation of Canis Major is an example. A typical nova rises to its maximum in a few days, and declines thereafter in brightness by a factor of about 10 in 40 days, although cases of both slower and more rapid declines are known and studied. Clouds of gas are ejected at high speeds during out- bu r sts, speeds typically of about 1500 km/s (930 mi/s), which is more than sufficient for the expelled gases to become entirely lost into interstellar space, together with my r iad fine dust particles that condense within the gases as they cool during their outwards motion. The total amount of material thus lost is estimated to be about one part in ten thousand of the total mass of the parent white dwarf star, although the amount in especially violent cases is almost certainly appreciably larger than this. Much thought has been given in recent years to the cause of novae. The consensus of opinion is that the basic mechanism of the explosion of a nova is the same as for the explosion of a thermonuclear weapon. To begin with, energy is produced at a comparatively gentle rate by NUCLEAR REACTIONS in material that is covered (tamped) by a layer of relatively inactive other material. Because of the tamping material, the energy produced by nuclear reactions cannot escape and accumulates within the reacting material itself. Provided the tamping effect is strong enough, the rising temperature and pressure can- not be alleviated by expansion, causing the nuclear reac- tions to become progressively more violent. The same c ycle of events is repeated with the energy released from the nuclear reactions, and it accelerates at an ever- increasing rate, until eventually the situation gets out of hand (in a ‘thermonuclear runaway’), or until the tamp- ing effect of the overlying material fails, and the material is expelled from the strong gravitational field of the white dwarf. Depending on the mass of the white dwarf, its chemical composition, and the amounts of the reactions and tamping materials, the details of explosion may vary in ways that are subject to mathematical calculation, and which have been found to agree with many of the observed features of novae. Novae are now considered to be like other forms of cat- aclysmic variable in consisting of an interacting binary system. The secondary component is a class K or M g iant, subgiant or dwarf star, which transfers matter on to the white-dwarf primary. Unlike certain supernovae, the outbursts do not disrupt the system, although material is expelled into space, and it is generally accepted that the system settles down into a POST - NOVA stage. Mass transfer is later resumed and after a long interval a second nova outburst may occur. The recurrence time is related to the mass of the white dwarf and (with reasonable assumptions about the mass-transfer rate) is of the order of 30,000 y ears for a white dwarf of 1.3 solar masses, and one mil- lion years for a white dwarf of 0.6 solar mass. Certain stars that apparently resemble novae are known to undergo explosions repeatedly, for example T Coronae appeared as a low-amplitude nova in 1866 and 1946, with two smaller outbursts in 1963 and 1975, while T Pyxidis did so in 1890, 1902, 1922, 1944 and 1966. Although it was once thought that these systems ( see RECURRENT NOVA ) might represent a stage following a principal nova outburst, this now appears unlikely, because of their different physical characteristics. The circumstances in which the nuclear reactions in a nova occur, especially if a supply of protons is available for mixing with carbon and oxygen, lead to the produc- tion of some nuclides that are not synthesized by nuclear processes occurring towards the centres of stars. Exam- ples are 15 N and 26 A1. It is also possible that neutrons produced by reactions of alpha particles with 13 C partic- ipate in a form of RP R OCESS , in which very heavy neu- tron-rich nuclei are synthesized. Condensing solid grains in the gases expelled by novae may be expected to con- tain such unusual nuclides.

Novae now appear to make a substantial contribution (together with supernovae and red giants) to the abundance of such isotopes in the interstellar medium. When the Solar System formed from interstel- lar material, some grains derived from novae would be present. The presence of 22 Ne and 26 Mg (the daughter products of 22 Na and 26 Al, respectively) in meteorites indicates that the protosolar nebula did indeed contain species from one or all of these sources. The total energy of explosion of a typical nova has been estimated at 10 45 ergs, which is about as much energy as the Sun emits in 10,000 years. It has been sug- gested that novae might be precursors for Type I super- novae. Spectroscopic evidence, however, indicates that some of the material from the white dwarf is lost at each outburst. This suggests that despite the accretion of material and the production of certain heavier elements in the outburst, the overall mass of the white dwarf is unlikely to increase sufficiently for it to reach the CHAN - DRASEKHAR LIMIT . nova-like variable (NL) V ARIABLE STAR subtype, a form of CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE .

Nubecula Major See LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD Nubecula Minor See SMALL MAGELLANIC CLOUD nuclear reactions Interactions between atomic nuclei or between atomic nuclei and subatomic particles or gamma rays. Nuclear reactions produce transformations from one ELEMENT or ISOTOPE to another. There are two basic types of reaction, FUSION and FISSION . The main astronomical occurrences of fusion are within stellar interiors, novae and during the early stages of the BIG BANG , resulting in the build-up of elements up to iron from lighter nuclei. In stellar interiors and in SUPERNOVAE absorption of protons and neutrons by nuclei builds up elements heavier than iron. The fusion reactions build elements of heavier mass number from the lighter. The first of these, thermonuclear fusion, is the process that created most of the helium in the Universe in the first few minutes after the Big Bang; it provides the main energy output of the stars, and indeed it governs STELLAR EVOLUTION . It also provides the energy released in hydrogen bombs; and it may eventually be harnessed for power generation in fusion reactors. The main astronomical occurrences of fission are within novae and supernovae, where very short wave- length gamma rays cause nuclei between about sulphur and iron to disintegrate to lighter nuclei (photo-disinte- gr a tion). In addition, in the interstellar medium cosmic ray impacts fragment carbon, nitrogen and oxygen nuclei to lithium, beryllium and boron ( see SPALLATION ). Fission accounts for the production of some elements and isotopes that are not produced by other processes. It is also involved in many radioactive decay processes, and is the basis of current nuclear energy generation and a tom bombs.

There are four main areas involved in nucleosynthesis: the early stages of the BIG BANG ; the energy-generating reactions inside stars; reactions during NOVA and SUPERNOVA explosions; and COSMIC RAY collisions within the interstellar medium. The first nucleosynthesis reactions to be identified w ere the PROTON – PROTON REACTION and the CARBON – NITROGEN – O XYGEN CYCLE . Both of these were suggested in 1938 as sources for the energy of the Sun, the former by Hans BETHE , and the latter, independently of each other, by Bethe and Carl von WEIZSÄCKER . The processes both convert hydrogen into helium-4, the pro- ton–proton reaction being most important for stars with masses up to that of the Sun and the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle becoming dominant with- in more massive stars. In 1956 and 1957 Geoffrey and Margaret BURBIDGE , William FOWLER and Sir Fred HOYLE identified most of the remaining reactions inside stars that synthesise the ele- ments up to iron, though only the most massive stars are able to follow the whole sequence. The next stage after helium formation is not the production of beryllium-8, because that decays back to two helium-4 nuclei ( \u0001 -parti- cles) in 2 \u0002 10 \u0003 16 s, but it is the TRIPLE - \u0001 PROCESS pro- ducing carbon-12. The triple- \u0001 process involves two helium nuclei combining and then a third being added before the beryllium-8 can decay. It requires a tempera- ture of about 10 8 K before it will start since the NUCLEAR REACTIONS involved are slightly endothermic (requiring the supply of energy) and therefore need the input of ther- mal energy to get them to occur. The triple- \u0001 process ov erall is exothermic: more energy is released by the process than is used in starting it, because the carbon-12 nucleus that is the result of the reaction is in an excited state and emits a high-energy gamma ray. Once carbon-12 has been produced, helium-4 nuclei can be added to it (a process known as \u0001 -capture) to pro- duce, successively, oxygen-16, neon-20, magnesium-24, silicon-28, sulphur-32 and argon-36. For the Sun, the sequence will probably come to a halt with the produc- tion of oxygen-16. \u0001 -capture can also start from other elements and this is particularly significant for the nitro- gen-14 left by the carbon–nitrogen–oxygen cycle, leading to fluorine-18 and neon-22. As the temperature increas- es, carbon and oxygen start to combine directly and eventually, at about 3 \u0002 10 9 K, silicon-28 combines with itself to produce nickel-56. The latter is radioactive and decays to cobalt-56 and then to the stable isotope iron-56, although those decay processes will occur out- side the star, because the production of nickel at the star’s centre occurs immediately prior to its explosion as a supernova. There are many more reactions than are listed here, and some result in the release of neutrons. Those neutrons combine with nuclei to produce intermediate elements and isotopes ( see SP R OCESS ). The reactions up to the production of iron-56 are exothermic.

The elements above iron are therefore thought to be formed during supernova explosions by the successive addition of neu- trons (the RP R OCESS ) and protons (the PP R OCESS ), with the energy of the explosion fuelling the reactions. Although helium-4 is produced within stars, its abun- dance at about 25% by mass ( see ASTROCHEMISTRY ) throughout the Universe is far too high to be accounted for in this way. It is therefore thought that most of the helium-4, along with hydrogen-2 (deuterium), helium-3 and lithium- 7, was generated during the early stages of the Big Bang. At a time a few seconds after the start of the Big Bang, the numbers of protons and neutrons would be in the ratio of about 87% to 13%. The abundance ratio of protons to neu- trons is largely independent of the exact conditions in the Big Bang. This is because, in equilibrium, the ratio is deter- mined by the balance between the number of protons and electrons combining to form neutrons and neutrinos and the number of neutrons and neutrinos combining to form protons and electrons, and this depends only upon the reaction rates. About 100 seconds after the Big Bang , the temperature would have fallen sufficiently for deuterium to form and to be stable. All the available neutrons would then quickly combine with protons to produce deuterium, and the deuterium would build up to helium-4. Since the 13% of the mass of the Universe in the form of neutrons com- bines with 13% in the form of protons during this process, the final amount of helium-4 produced this way is about 26%, which is convincingly close to the observed 24.9%. Finally, some of the light elements exist in far greater abundance than might be expected from the amounts pre- dicted by the above processes. They are also easily destroyed inside stars. Such nuclei as lithium-6, lithium-7, beryllium-9, boron-10 and boron-11 are therefore thought to be produced in the interstellar medium by SPALLATION reactions. In these reactions high-energy cosmic ray pro- tons and \u0001 -particles collide with nuclei of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, fragmenting them and producing the lighter nuclei.

OB associations are regions of space where massive stars are currently being formed or have just recently been formed. They are one of the least dense type of star cluster. The predominance of the very luminous high-mass OST ARS and BST ARS renders OB associations recogniz- able at great distances, even through the dusty haze of interstellar space. Tens or hundreds of these massive stars can occur in a single association. Low-mass (faint) stars may exist in abundance too, but they are far harder to see in distant OB complexes. The Great Nebula in Orion, with its core of hot stars, is part of an OB association that is relatively close to us, hence low-mass young stars are also detected. Recent computer models suggest that OB associations could be self-perpetuating: that is, an appreciable popula- tion of massive stars can lead to the preferential formation of new massive stars. The mechanism involves the power- ful stellar winds from the surrounding O stars. Vigorous stellar winds could disperse parental clouds, inhibiting the formation of lower-mass stars. OB associations are a feature of the gas-rich spiral and irregular galaxies, but not of elliptical galaxies in which no y oung stellar population is apparent. The frequency with which stars of different mass occur in a galaxy (or part of one) is called the ‘mass spectrum’. In our Galaxy, low- mass stars (like our Sun, and smaller) are prodigiously more abundant than high-mass stars and contribute most of the mass. However, hot blue stars are unrepresentative- ly more obvious because of their tremendous luminosities. The high-mass of these stars leads to the high incidence of supernovae observed within OB complexes. See also OPEN CLUSTER ; T ASSOCIATION Oberon Outermost of the five SATELLITES of URANUS that were known before the flyby by VOYA GER 2. It was discovered in 1787 by William HERSCHEL , who also found its neighbour TITANIA . It has a dark icy surface with an albedo of 0.25. Oberon was the most distant of the previously known satellites from Voyager’s trajectory, with the result that the best images have a resolution no better than about 20 km (12 mi). This is sufficient to show that the whole of the visible area of its surface is fairly densely cratered, and that there are patches of bright ejecta surrounding what are presumably the youngest impact craters. The darkest parts of the surface are patches on the floors of some of the craters. Other notable features on Oberon are a mountain peak about 11 km (7 mi) high and a large trough with scalloped walls named Mommur Chasma.

The main mirror in a reflecting telescope can also be called the objective but this use is now uncommon. In astronomy, objective almost always means the large lens that collects and focuses the light to produce an image. A single-lens objective suffers from several ABERRATIONS , the most noticeable being CHROMATIC ABERRATION . A CHROMATS , with two lenses, and APOCHROMATS , normally with three lenses, are used as objectives in astronomical and terrestrial telescopes. objective prism Narrow-angled PRISM that is placed in front of the aperture of a telescope to produce a low-res- olution SPECTRUM of every star in the field of view. Pho- tographs taken using this instrument allow the easy and rapid spectral classification of a large number of stars to be made. oblateness Measure of the amount by which a spheroid deviates from a perfect sphere; it is defined as the ratio of the difference between the equatorial and polar radii of a body to its equatorial radius. Any celestial body that rotates tends to bulge at its equator by an amount that depends both on its speed of rotation and on whether it is solid or fluid in composition. Oblateness is therefore a good indicator of the rotational speed of a star or planet. See also ELLIPTICITY oblate spheroid See SPHEROID obliquity of ecliptic Angle between the plane of the ECLIPTIC and the CELESTIAL EQUATOR , caused by the inclination of the Earth’s rotational axis to the plane of its orbit. The present value of the obliquity of the ecliptic is 23º26 \u0001 b ut the effects of PRECESSION and NUTATION cause it to vary between 21º55 \u0001 and 24º18 \u0001 ov er a period of 40,000 years. It is currently decreasing by about 0 \u0001 .47 per year and in about 1500 years time will begin to increase again. This value also represents the maximum angular distance the Sun can lie north or south of the equator. See also SEASONS Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur French research insti- tution formed in 1988 by amalgamating Nice Observatory with the Centre for Geodynamic and Astronomical Study and Research (CERGA, which dates from 1974). Nice Observatory was founded in 1881 and equipped with a 29-inch (0.74-m) telescope named after the observatory’s sponsor, Raphael Louis von Bischhoffsheim (1823–1906), which was completed in 1886. CERGA operates a 0.9-m (35-in) Schmidt telescope. Today, the observatory special- izes in theoretical and observational astrophysics using facilities such as the SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATO - RY and the VERY LARGE TELESCOPE . observatory Any facility specifically for making celestial observations and measurements. Some structures such as Stonehenge ( see ARCHAEOASTRONOMY ) may well have been used for observations. The observatory proper evolved from Babylonian constructions set up for astro- logical observation from about 750 BC , and reached a high state of scientific development in the late 16th century with the observatories of Tycho BRAHE . The observatory as a telescope housing dates from the 17th century; notable examples are COPENHAGEN OBSERVATORY (1642), P ARIS OBSERVATORY (1671) and GREENWICH OBSERVATORY (1675), founded principally for geodesy and navigation. The era of observatories built for scientific research rather than the practical needs of the state began in the 18th century. It brought about the development of large facilities such as Lord Rosse’s observatory in Ireland (1845; see BIRR CASTLE ASTRONOMY ), and LICK OBSERVA - TORY in California (1888) and YERKES OBSERVATORY in Wisconsin (1897) with their great refractors. The first half of the 20th century saw a continuing dominance of the USA in large telescope building with MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY ’s 100-inch (2.5-m) and P ALOMAR OBSERVA - TORY ’s 200-inch (5-m) reflectors, completed in 1917 and 1948, respectively. With the arrival of frequent and rapid air travel in the 1960s, optical astronomers were no longer restricted in where to locate their observatories, and the next decade saw a proliferation of telescopes in the 4-metre class on excellent remote sites. The post-war years also saw a gr o wth in the number of large radio telescopes, and the first proposals for observatories in space to overcome the limited range of wavelengths available to astronomers on the Earth’s surface. T oday, the turn-of-the-century boom in 8–10-metre class telescopes is well under way, and a new generation of optical-astronomy institutions such as the GEMINI OBSER - VAT O RY and the W . M . KECK OBSERVATORY is emerging. The modern observatory is often far from its telescopes, either because of the geographical remoteness of the observing site (as with the EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY ) or 289 O O \u0001 Oberon This is the closest image obtained of Uranus’ satellite Oberon during the 1986 January Voyager 2 flyby.

Increasingly important are observatories dedicated to popular astronomy. These range from the private obser- va tories of amateur astronomers (some of which, like their 18th-century forebears, challenge the smaller professional observatories in the quality of their equipment) to major educational facilities such as the FA ULKES TELESCOPE . Public education and outreach is giving a new lease of life to the older facilities of professional observatories, whose w orking astronomers now use newer telescopes elsewhere. A good example is the 0.91-m (36-in.) reflector of the RO YA L OBSERVATORY , EDINBURGH (1928), which is now the centrepiece of the observatory’s Visitor Centre. occultation Event in which one body is obscured by another – in other words, when a distant object is hidden by a nearer one. An obvious example is a SOLAR ECLIPSE , which is, strictly, an occultation of the Sun by the Moon. The term occultation can be applied to a range of celestial objects, but the most commonly observed are lunar occultations, which occur as the Moon obscures stars during its passage along the band of the ECLIPTIC . The most readily observed lunar occultations are disap- pearance (immersion) events, occurring on the Moon’s leading (easterly) limb before full. At this time, the leading limb is dark; occultations occurring when the Moon is a w axing crescent may be especially favourable for observa- tion, with the limb dimly visible by EARTHSHINE as it approaches the target star. Inexperienced observers are often surprised by the suddenness with which the star v anishes: this is due to the Moon having no atmosphere and the star being at such a great distance that it is virtual- ly a point source of light. After full moon, reappearance (emersion) events are more readily observed, occurring at the dark trailing lunar limb. As with disappearances, these events occur very abruptly. Successful observation depends on good predic- tions, including an accurate forecast of the POSITION ANGLE on the Moon’s limb at which reappearance will take place. Visual study of lunar occultations has been undertaken for over a century, and still plays a role in astronomy. Pre- cise timings of events, coupled with precise positional data for the observing location, provide useful information on the Moon’s orbital motion. Timing accuracy can be further improved by the application of video recording techniques. High-speed photometry has also been used to obtain light curves for stars during immersion, allowing identification of previously unknown close double stars and measurement of the diameters of some of the nearer stars. In the course of a year, the Moon may occult more than 4000 stars in the range of a fairly standard amateur telescope. Good star catalogues and modern computing capabilities make the calculation of predictions relatively straightforward. Observational reports are collected by the International Lunar Occultation Centre in Japan for reduction, and the resulting data are available for use by professional astronomers. Stars are not the only bodies to be occulted by the Moon; on occasion, a planet or asteroid may also be occulted. In the case of Jupiter, the planet’s own satellite system can be seen to be occulted. The major planets, being very much closer than the stars, show disks, so that occultations are gradual, lasting several seconds; the brightness of Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn allows events occurring at the Moon’s bright limb to be observed quite readily. Occultations of the planets, while rare and yielding less scientific data than those involving stars, can be spectacular to watch in a small telescope or binoculars. A spectacular planetary occultation was observed from central England on 1980 October 4, when, in the pre-dawn sky, Venus was grazed by the Moon’s limb, being only partially obscured. Lunar mountains and val- leys were seen in profile against Venus’ bright gibbous disk. Graze occultations for a star can be seen along a track no more than 1 km (0.6 mi) wide on Earth’s surface and are consequently rare. Teams of observers spread perpendicular to a graze track can obtain multiple tim- ings of events as the Moon’s irregular limb alternately covers and reveals the star, gaining much useful informa- tion about the lunar profile. Planets may also, on rare occasions, occult stars. Brightening and fading of stars during immersion or emersion can provide information about planets’ atmos- pheric layering. Among noteworthy events was the occul- tation of 28 Sagittarii by Saturn and its rings on 1989 July 3. The following night, Saturn’s satellite Titan occulted the star in an event seen extensively from Europe, with a brightening at mid-occultation resulting from refraction of starlight by Titan’s dense atmosphere. The rings of Uranus were discovered during an occultation of the star SAO 158687 on 1977 March 10. At certain times, when the plane of their orbits aligns with Earth, Jupiter’s Galilean satellites may undergo mutual occultations. They are also, of course, frequently seen to be occulted by Jupiter itself as they pass behind it on their orbits. Occultations of stars by asteroids are also rare, but pro- vide extremely valuable opportunities to determine the profiles of these small bodies. Essentially, an asteroid casts a ‘shadow’ equivalent to its diameter (usually less than 200 km/120 mi) as it occults a star. The critical observa- tion in these cases is whether an occultation occurs at all, and its duration (defining a cord across the asteroid’s diameter). Secondary occultations have revealed the pres- ence of satellites orbiting some asteroids, including (6) Hebe, (18) Melpomene and (532) Herculina. occulting disk Small metal disk placed in the focal plane of a telescope to cover a bright object in order that a fainter one may be observed. An occulting disk is used in a CORONAGRAPH to produce an artificial eclipse of the Sun. It blocks the light from the Sun’s disk and enables observations to be made of the fainter CORONA . The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) also made use of an occulting disk to block out the direct light from stars, allowing it to image the infrared radiation from their sur- rounding regions. ocean Great body of salt water on the surface of a planet. At the present geological epoch, oceans are known only on the Earth. There is strong evidence, however, that in the geological past an ocean covered the northern part of MARS . The Martian northern plains are very flat, and their borders with the highlands have features that resemble terrestrial oceanic shorelines. Furthermore, many presently dry Martian valleys of obvious fluvial morphology open into these plains. There is also evidence that in the recent geological past an ocean covered all the surface of the Jovian satellite EUROPA : its surface, which is flat on the large scale, is made of almost pure water ice occultation 290 O \u0001 ocean The Conamara Chaos region of Jupiter’s satellite Europa, imaged from the Galileo orbiter in 1997.

Olbers, Comet 13P/ Short-period comet discovered on 1815 March 6 by Wilhelm Olbers, Bremen, Germany. An elliptical orbit was calculated for the comet by Friedrich Bessel, this being revised following recovery, some months later than expected, by William Brooks (1844–1921) at the next return in 1887 August. At the most recent return, in 1956, 13P/Olbers reached peak magnitude \u0001 5.6. The orbital period is 69.56 years. Olbers, (Heinrich) Wilhelm (Matthäus) (1758–1840) German physician and amateur astronomer, now best known for the paradox named after him. He was one of the CELESTIAL POLICE who searched for the supposed missing planet between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, discovering two of the first four asteroids, Pallas (1802) and Vesta (1807). He also found several new comets, but more importantly invented a new method of calculating a comet’s orbit from just three observations of its position. Although he was not the originator of OLBERS ’ P ARADOX – Edmond Halley mentioned it, and the Swiss astronomer Philippe de Chéseaux (1718–51) gave essentially the same explanation as did Olbers – it was Olbers’ name that became attached to it, following his discussion of it in a paper published in 1823. He was tireless in encouraging others, and set Friedrich Wilhelm BESSEL on his career. Olbers’ paradox P aradox discussed in 1826 by Heinrich OLBERS (although it had been raised earlier by, for example, Edmond Halley) when he posed the question ‘Why is the sky dark at night?’ If space were infinite and uniformly filled with stars, then in whatever direction the observer were to look he or she would eventually end up looking at the surface of a star and so the entire sky should be as bright as the surface of the Sun. The paradox can be resolved in various ways. For example: if the Universe is not sufficiently old, light from the more remote objects cannot yet have reached us; or the expansion of the Universe ensures that radiation emit- ted by galaxies is weakened by the redshift and cannot be detected beyond a certain range. Oljato One of the earliest APOLLO ASTEROIDS to be discovered, in 1947; it was numbered as 2201 after its recovery in 1979.

Situated at 18º.6N 134º.0W on the north- w estern flank of the THARSIS MONTES on MARS , it rises some 24 km (15 mi) above the surrounding plains and is more than 700 km (430 mi) in diameter. It comprises a central nested caldera 80 km (50 mi) across, from which the terraced flanks slope away at angles of only 4º. The flanks are traversed by numerous lava flows and channels with a roughly radial arrangement. In many respects Olympus Mons is similar to terrestrial basaltic shields like those of Hawaii, but with a volume that is between 50 and 100 times greater. Towards the north and south ends of the main shield, lava flows drape a prominent peripheral escarpment, which, in places, forms a cliff 6 km (4 mi) high. Numerous landslides degrade this cliff and spread out on to the adjacent plains. The flows themselves are very long compared with terrestrial flows, a phenomenon that may be explained either by very high 291 O OCTANS ( GEN . OCTANTIS , ABBR .

Onsala Space Observatory Swedish national facility for radio astronomy located 48 km (30 mi) south of Gothenburg, and operated by Chalmers Institute of Tech- nology. It has a 25-m (82-ft) telescope that can be used independently or in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), and a 20-m (66-ft) dish for millimetre-wave observations. The observatory also operates the SWEDISH ESO SUBMILLIMETRE TELESCOPE . Oort, Jan Hendrik (1900–1992) Dutch astronomer who investigated the structure and dynamics of our Galaxy and others, was one of the first to use radio astron- omy to study the Galaxy, and put forward the ‘Oort cloud’ theory of the origin of comets. After studying at Groningen under Jacobus KAPTEYN he joined the Univer- sity of Leiden, where he spent the rest of his working life, becoming professor of astronomy in 1935 and director of Leiden Observatory in 1945. In the late 1920s, building on work by Kapteyn and Bertil LINDBLAD on the structure of the Galaxy and our position within it, Oort showed from statistical studies of stellar motions that the Sun is 30,000 l.y. (a better value than Lindblad’s 50,000 l.y.) from the galactic centre and takes about 225,000 years to make one revolution. From this he calculated that the Galaxy contains around 100 bil- lion solar masses. He also introduced the OORT CON - STANTS to describe stellar motion. After World War II, Oort and Hendrik van de HULST recognized the potential of the newly emerging techniques of radio astronomy. In 1951 they discovered the TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE LINE in the spectrum of interstellar neu- tral hydrogen ( HI REGIONS ) that van de Hulst had predicted seven years before. Neutral hydrogen pervades the Galaxy, and the 21-cm emission passes through interstellar dust clouds that block visible light, so Oort and his colleagues were able to map the Galaxy, revealing its spiral arms. In 1950 Oort proposed that comets reside in a huge shell-like region a light-year or so from the Sun, and that gravitational perturbations occasionally send a comet sun- wards. This region is now known as the OORT CLOUD . In 1956 he and Theodore Walraven (1916– ) found that radiation from the Crab Nebula is highly polarized, char- acteristic of SYNCHROTRON RADIATION . Oort cloud Spherical halo of COMET nuclei gravitationally bound to and surrounding the Sun to a distance of 100,000 AU (a third of the way to the next closest star), proposed by the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. While direct evidence for the existence of the Oort cloud is currently impossible to obtain, the idea is widely accepted as an explanation for the observed frequency and orbital characteristics of new LONG - PERIOD COMETS . The Oort cloud is believed to contain a population of up to 10 12 comet nuclei. Gravitational perturbations by passing stars may dislodge Oort cloud nuclei from their distant orbits, causing them to fall sunwards and perhaps to pass through the inner Solar System, where they can become spectacular new comets. A new comet of this nature may return to the far depths of space on a long-period orbit (as, for example, was the case with C/1996 B2 HYAKUTAKE , which is not expected to return for 14,000 years). If its path takes it close to one of the planets, particularly Jupiter, a comet may have its orbit modified to one of short period. Refinements of the model from the 1950s onwards led to the suggestion that the Oort cloud may become more concentrated towards the ecliptic plane at distances of 10,000 to 20,000 AU from the Sun, extending inwards to join the EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT . Some Solar System dynamicists propose that residence in the Kuiper belt is an intermediate stage between the initial inwards fall from the Oort cloud and appearance as a new long-period comet. Oort constants Tw o constants invented by Jan OORT to describe the motions of stars around the Galaxy. The orbital motions of stars mean that nearby stars are moving with respect to the Sun. For example a star that is closer to the centre of the Galaxy and behind the Sun will have a relative velocity that on average causes it to move towards the Sun and away from the centre of the Galaxy.

An optical depth of 1 corresponds to the apparent surface of a semi-transparent object or region such as the solar photosphere. open cluster Loose irregularly shaped star cluster, containing from a few tens to a few thousand members. An open cluster may be regarded as a localized region of enhanced star density as compared to its immediate surroundings. A few open clusters have been known since antiquity, including the HYADES , the PLEIADES and PRAESEPE . Several star clusters were included in the MESSIER CATALOGUE , and still more are found in the NEW GENERAL CATALOGUE (NGC). The stars belonging to a cluster not only lie close together in space but also share a common origin; they generally travel together through space, although they also to some extent move within the cluster. A sometimes severe problem in studies of stellar clusters, especially in star-rich regions, is the separation of true cluster members from field stars in the same region of the sky. Open clusters are much less rich in stars than GLOBU - LAR CLUSTERS . They sometimes contain no more than a few tens of stars, and seldom more than a few thousand. A typical radius for an open cluster is about 10 l.y. The dis- tribution of stars may vary considerably from cluster to cluster, but it is never as concentrated towards the centre as in globular clusters. Open clusters are susceptible to disruption, not only through members becoming free of the gravitational influ- ence of the group but also through tidal forces from the Galaxy or encounters with interstellar clouds. Only the r ichest clusters may survive more than 10 9 y ears, while the smallest and least tightly bound do not last more than a few million years. Their hazards are strengthened by their being found only near the galactic plane, which is the rea- son for the older designation ‘galactic clusters’. The num- ber of known open clusters in our Galaxy is nearly 1200, b ut this is certainly only a very small fraction of the total number. As all stars in a cluster take part in the general motion of the cluster, it is possible to derive the distances of nearby clusters by the MOVING CLUSTER method. All stars are thought to be born in clusters, most of which, however, are gravitationally unbound and thus rapidly disrupt and spread their contents throughout the general field. In still recognizable clusters all members may thus be considered equally old (barring the y oungest clusters and associations, where the ages are comparable to the spread in star formation time, of order 10 6 y ears). Studies of star clusters, therefore, yield good tests for theories of STELLAR EVOLUTION . Evolution pro- ceeds more rapidly for the more massive stars, so these stars leave the MAIN SEQUENCE before the less massive ones. Accordingly, the position of the brightest main- sequence stars in a colour–magnitude diagram gives an estimate of the cluster age. For extremely young clusters, it is the faintest main-sequence stars that yield the age, as no stars have yet left the main sequence and the least massive ones have not yet got there. Such clusters are often still embedded in their parent clouds of gas and dust. See also EMBEDDED CLUSTER ; OB ASSOCIATION ; STELLAR ASSOCIATION ; T ASSOCIATION open universe Solution of Einstein’s equations of GENERAL RELATIVITY in which the mass density of the universe is less than the CRITICAL DENSITY . This critical density is related to the HUBBLE CONSTANT and is estimated to be of the order of 9.2 \u0004 l0 \u0002 27 g/cm 3 . This implies that the universe will eventually accelerate and expand until the stars and radiation come into thermodynamic equilibrium, a state that is referred to as the HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE .

It takes 0.376 days to circuit the planet, at a distance of 53,800 km (33,400 mi) from its centre, in a near-circular, near- equatorial orbit. With CORDELIA it acts as a SHEPHERD MOON to the planet’s Epsilon Ring, Ophelia being just outside the orbit of that ring.

OPH ) L arge but ill-defined constellation of the equatorial region of the sky. It represents Aesculapius, a son of Apollo and a mythical healer, holding a huge snake, a symbol of regeneration. The snake is represented by the constella- tion SERPENS , which is divided into two, one half each side of Ophiuchus. RASAL - HAGUE , the brightest star, is mag. 2.1. \u0005 Oph, mag. 4.57, is a fascinating multiple star; binoculars show two wide companions of 7th magnitude, one either side, while high magnification on a small telescope divides \u0005 Oph itself into two. An easy binary is 70 Oph, mags. 4.2 and 6.0, colours yellow and orange, which has an orbital period of 88 years. Another binary for small tele- scopes is 36 Oph, consisting of two orange dwarfs each of mag. 5.1 with an orbital period around 500 years. RS Oph is a RECURRENT NOVA with five record- ed outbursts (a record it shares with T Pyxidis) in 1898, 1933, 1958, 1967 and 1985. Lying in the Milky Way towards the centre of our Galaxy, Ophiuchus is r ich in star clusters, particularly globulars. The two best globular clusters are M10 and M12. NGC 6633 and IC 4665 are both large open clusters for binoc- ulars. Ophiuchus also contains the nearby red dwarf BARNARD ’ SSTAR , and KEPLER ’ SSTAR appeared here in 1604.

Öpik, Ernst Julius (1893–1985) Estonian astronomer, an expert on stellar evolution and meteors, who made contributions to almost every field of astronomy; many of his bold predictions were later proved to be true. He helped to found Tashkent (Uzbekistan) University during W orld War I, returning to Estonia to head the astronomy department at the University of Tartu. In 1948 he fled to Northern Ireland, and spent the rest of his career at Armagh Observatory. In 1910 Öpik discovered that \u0002 2 Eridani was a white dwarf star; two decades later (1938), he showed how main-sequence stars like the Sun can evolve into red giants. From a study of the orbits and perturbations of comets, he predicted that they reside in a cloud extending to 60,000 AU from the Sun, an idea later revived by Jan Oort ( see OORT CLOUD ). Öpik studied the ablation of meteoroids passing through the Earth’s a tmosphere, knowledge later used to design heat shields that protect spacecraft during re-entry. Oppolzer, Theodor (Egon Ritter) von (1841–86) Austrian mathematician and astronomer who calculated the time and track of every lunar and solar eclipse from 1207 BC to AD 2163. This work was published posthumously (1887) as the Canon der Finsternisse (‘Canon of Eclipses’). Oppolzer was professor of celestial mechanics at the University of Vienna and published over 300 papers on the orbits of comets and asteroids. He devised a new theory to explain the lunar motion, which w as taken into account by later researchers in this field, including E.W. BROWN . opposition P osition of a SUPERIOR PLANET when it lies directly opposite the Sun in the sky, as viewed from Earth. At this point, the three bodies are in exact alignment, with the Earth between the Sun and the planet. The term can also refer to the time at which this alignment occurs. When at opposition, a planet’s ELONGATION is 180º and its phase is full. Opposition is the best time for observing a planet since it marks its closest approach to Earth although, because orbits are elliptical, this distance can vary between oppositions, particularly in the case of Mars. The term is equally applicable to asteroids. Inferior planets cannot come to opposition. See also CONJUNCTION optical double DOUBLE STAR , the components of which appear to lie close together as seen from Earth but are actually totally unconnected. Optical doubles appear close together due to a line-of-sight effect, but in reality the stars often lie at great distances from each other. optical interferometer Instrument that combines the light from two or more light paths to produce high- resolution images or spectra. When two or more light beams from the same object are combined, any small differences due to the separate paths along which they have travelled cause the beams to interfere with each other. This interference gives rise to patterns of dark and light which can be measured to analyse the differences producing them. The earliest example of an optical interferometer used in astronomy is that which enabled Albert Michelson (1852–1931) and Francis PEASE to measure the angular diameter of Betelgeuse as 0 \u0003 .047 in 1920. It consisted of a 6-m beam mounted on the front of the 100-inch (2.5-m) Mount Wilson reflector. Two movable mirrors on the beam directed two light beams from Betelgeuse on to the telescope, where they were combined in an interferometer. By moving the mirrors, Michelson and P ease determined the separation at which the fringes just disappeared and from this they calculated Betelgeuse’s angular diameter. Radio astronomers routinely use the INTERFEROMETRY principle to construct arrays of telescopes that can resolve detail equivalent to that attainable by a single reflector with a diameter equal to the separation of the telescopes in the array. The same method can be used by optical astronomers but is much more difficult to achieve. Recent developments have led to several observatories designing optical interferometers based on existing and new tele- scopes. For example, ESO’s VERY LARGE TELESCOPE (VLT) will one day operate as an optical interferometer using its four 8-m (315-in.) telescopes in conjunction with an array of smaller telescopes around 1.8 m (71 in.) in diameter. Similarly, there are plans to combine the two 10-m (390-in.) Keck telescopes with several 2-m (79-in.) telescopes to form an interferometer. orbit Pa th of a celestial body in a gravitational field generated by other bodies. There is usually a single dominant primary body, and the path is basically an ELLIPSE around the primary body, which is located at one of the foci of the ellipse. In rare cases the orbit may be a P ARABOLA or a HYPERBOLA . The size, shape and orientation of the orbit are described by the ORBITAL ELEMENTS . The attractions of other bodies in addition to the primary body cause PERTURBATIONS to the orbit. orbital elements Describing the size, shape and orientation of an ORBIT , and the position of the orbiting body in the orbit at some EPOCH . There are six orbital elements, and if the mass of the primary body is not know (such as in a binary star system) then the orbital period (or the mean motion) is also needed. In addition, the epoch of the elements is usually specified. The elements vary slowly with time as a result of perturbations by other bodies, and the epoch is the time at which they had the particular values specified. The various angles defining an elliptical orbit are shown in the diagram. The point P is the position of a fic- titious object that orbits with constant angular speed with the same period as the real object, and coincides with the real object at pericentre and apocentre. The orbital ele- ments are: a the semimajor axis (half the length of the major axis of the ellipse) e the eccentricity i the inclination to the reference plane M the mean anomaly \u0004 the argument of pericentre \u0005 the longitude of the ascending node Note that M and \u0004 are measured around the orbit plane, and \u0005 is measured around the reference plane.

Only six of these quantities are needed to define an orbit. For the planets and natural satellites, it is usual to take as the orbital elements the quantities a , e , i , \u0004 , π , \u0001 . The reason for choosing the composite angles \u0004 and π rather than M and \u0003 is that for many planets and satellites the inclinations are small, and so the NODE is not a well- defined point (for the Earth the inclination to the ecliptic of date is zero, and so the node is not defined at all). It is preferable, therefore, to measure all angles from the well- defined EQUINOX . For asteroids and artificial satellites of the Earth the inclinations are generally fairly large, and so the node is well defined. In this case the orbital elements are usually taken as the quantities a , e , i , M , \u0003 , \u0001 . In either case, the quantities \u0004 or M vary rapidly as the object moves around its orbit, and so the epoch of the elements is an important quantity. For comets and newly discovered asteroids the perihe- lion distance and the time of perihelion passage are usual- ly of particular interest, and so these are taken as two of the orbital elements. The full set used is T , q , e , I , \u0003 , \u0001 . As the mean longitude or mean anomaly at epoch is not used, the epoch of the elements is of lesser importance than it is for planetary elements. orbiter Any spacecraft that makes at least one revolution around a Solar System body. If the spacecraft is injected into a polar orbit, the whole surface of the body can, in general, be scanned by cameras and other instruments. The first spacecraft to orbit the Moon was the Soviet LUNA 10 in 1966. The first planetary orbiter was NASA’s MARINER 9, which went into orbit around Mars in 1971. Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (OAO) Series of US astronomical satellites launched 1966–72. The first was a failure, but OAO-2 and OAO-3 (known as COPERNICUS ) made ultraviolet observations of stars and interstellar matter. OAO-3, which operated for nine years, also carried a UK X-ray instrument which made important observations. Orientale, Mare (Eastern Sea) Farside lunar lava plain with rings extending on to the visible western limb of the Moon. It is the most extensively studied multi-ring impact BASIN on the Moon, because it is the youngest and so has the best-preserved ring system. The eastern aspects of the rings are visible during a favourable LIBRATION . Long after the impact, lunar basalts tracked up underlying faults and flooded the inner region of this basin, producing Mare Orientale. Extensive scarring from this basin’s EJECTA is visible on western limb craters. origin of planets See COSMOGONY Orion See feature article Orion Arm (Orion Spur) Segment of one of the spiral arms of the GALAXY within which our Solar System is situated. The arm curves away from the galactic centre, starting near Cygnus, passing Orion and ending near Puppis and Vela. But in fact all the brighter naked-eye stars, plus the ORION NEBULA ,are w ithin the arm. The Solar System is on the edge of the arm closest to the centre of the Galaxy. The Orion Arm is probably a branch off one of the main spiral arms of the Galaxy, and so is perhaps better called by its alternative name of the Orion Spur. Orionids METEOR SHOWER , active between October 16 and 30, produced by debris from Comet 1P/ HALLEY encountered at the ascending node of its orbit. The maximum is broad, over a couple of days around October 20–22, and shows some variation in timing from year to year, presumably as a result of the meteor stream’s filamentary nature. Peak zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) is 295 O ORION ( GEN . ORIONIS , ABBR . ORI ) G enerally regarded as the most splendid constellation of all, lying squarely on the celestial equator and hence equally well seen from both hemispheres. In Greek mythology, Orion was a great hunter, the son of Poseidon, but was stung to death by a scorpion, now represented by the constellation Scorpius. In the sky, Orion’s dogs follow at his heels in the form of the constellations Canis Major and Canis Minor. Orion’s leading star, RIGEL , is the seventh-brightest in the entire sky, while BETELGEUSE , tenth-brightest in the sky, is a red supergiant that varies unpre- dictably. The most distinctive feature is the Belt of Orion, a row of three 2nd-mag- nitude stars named ALNITAK , ALNILAM and MINTAKA . Other 2nd-magnitude stars are BELLATRIX and SAIPH . South of the belt lies the Sword of Orion , marked by a complex of stars and nebulosity. The main part of the nebula was catalogued by Charles Messier as M42, but is better known as the ORION NEBULA . At its heart is the TRAPEZIUM , a multiple star. A subsection of the same cloud is catalogued as M43, while more nebulosity, known as NGC 1977, surrounds the 5th-magnitude star 42 Ori to the north. Farther north still is the large open cluster NGC 1981. The southern tip of the sword is marked by \u0006 Ori, a wide double for small telescopes, mags. 2.8 and 6.9. \u0007 Ori is a 4th-magnitude quadruple star divisible in small telescopes, with a fainter triple star, Struve 761, in the same field of view. Another of Orion’s nebular treasures is the HORSEHEAD NEBULA , a dark cloud resembling a chess knight, sil- houetted against a strip of bright nebulosity, IC 434, that extends south from \b Ori. Unfortunately, the Horsehead is too faint to detect in amateur telescopes and is well seen only on long-exposure photographs. BRIGHTEST STARS Name RA dec.

At a typical distance of 1500 l.y., they are the nearest such clouds to us. The individual clouds may be up to 100,000 times the mass of the Sun and 100 or more light-years in size. The clouds are the sites of active star formation, especially in their denser cores. These cores are only detectable from their infrared and molecular radio emissions. One such core, designated OMC-1, is associated with the ORION NEBULA and the young stars of the TRAPEZIUM . See also BECKLIN – NEUGEBAUER OBJECT ; KLEINMANN – LOW NEBULA Orion Nebula (M42, NGC1976) HII REGION that is easily visible to the naked eye as the central object in the sw ord of ORION (RA 05 h 35 m .4 dec. \u0002 05º27 \u0003 ). The main part of the nebula is separated from a smaller part of the same cloud, known as M43 or NGC1982, by a dark absorbing region called the FISH ’ S MOUTH . The nebula surrounds, and is excited by, the four young stars of the TRAPEZIUM (also known as \u0004 1 Ori). The nebula is about 1500 l.y. away on the nearer side of the ORION MOLECULAR CLOUDS and is little more than the inside of an incomplete spherical hole in the side of the much larger dark nebula. The Orion Nebula is over a degree across on the sky and thus some 25 to 30 l.y. in physical size. Its mass is several hundred times that of the Sun. orrery Geared mechanical model of the Solar System. The first orrery, probably that preserved in the Adler Planetarium, Chicago, was made by the English instru- ment-maker George Graham ( c .1673–1751) in about 1708. The name is usually attributed to John Rowley, who made a similar instrument for Charles Boyle (1676–1731), 4th Earl of Cork and Orrery, in c .1712. Many ‘grand orreries’ up to 1 m (3 ft) in diameter, showing the motions of the six known planets and their satellites, with clockwork movements, were made in Eng- land during the 18th century. From about 1775, hand- driven portable orreries came on the market, often with alternative fittings so that an orrery could be a ‘planetari- um’, ‘tellurium’ or ‘lunarium’, as desired. orthoscopic eyepiece Te lescope EYEPIECE designed to gi ve good definition, little geometric distortion and comfortable EYE RELIEF . It consists of two elements – a single eye lens that is normally plano-convex, and a cemented TRIPLET that is normally symmetrical. This arrangement produces an apparent field of view of 40º to 50º, which is smaller than other popular designs such as the PLÖSSL . Orthoscopic eyepieces are sometimes preferred by planetary observers looking for good performance at high magnification. Oschin Schmidt Telescope W orld’s first large SCHMIDT telescope, completed in 1948, with a 1.2-m (48-in.) corrector plate and a 1.8-m (72-in.) spherical mirror. Formerly known as the Palomar Schmidt, and renamed after the benefactor Samuel Oschin, the tele- scope is sited at P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY and operated by the CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY . It became famous in the 1950s for producing the P ALOMAR OBSERVA - TORY SKY SURVEY . Photographic plates from the survey w ere used to identify targets for the nearby HALE TELE - SCOPE . In 1984 the Oschin Schmidt was fitted with a new achromatic corrector plate in preparation for a new survey of the northern sky. Today, it is used with a CCD camera to search for NEAR - EARTH OBJECTS . oscillating universe Idea that if the universe is closed it will eventually collapse back to an infinitely small point, an event sometimes called the ‘Big Crunch’. It is conceivable that a new BIG BANG could follow the Big Crunch and create a brand new universe. This cycle could in principle repeat itself, alternately creating, then destroying and finally creating a new universe each cycle. osculating orbit ORBIT that a celestial body would continue in if all perturbing forces from other bodies were instantaneously cut off, leaving just the gravitational a ttraction of the primary body. The elements of this orbit are the osculating elements, and are mathematically equivalent to the instantaneous position and velocity. The current planetary ephemerides are generated by a numerical method that gives instantaneous position and v elocity at each time step. These can be converted into osculating elements to give a more meaningful representation of the orbit. They can be used for calculating the position of the body at any required time, and are very accurate close to the EPOCH of the elements, and still reasonably accurate (0º.01) up to one year from the epoch. Osculating elements of the planets are tabulated in The Astronomical Almanac . O star Any member of a class of blue-white stars, the spectra of which are defined by ABSORPTION LINES of ionized helium. Neutral helium lines are present in the cooler subclasses, while those of hydrogen remain strong. O stars lie at the extreme hot end of the main sequence. Dwarf subclasses range from 32,000 K at O9.5 to 50,000 K at O3 (the earliest defined); zero-age masses range from 16 to perhaps 120 solar masses (the upper limit is not well known); zero-age luminosities range from 30,000 solar to over 2 million; dwarf lifetimes are from 10 million years to only 2 million. Higher luminosity MK classes are recognized in part by the weakening of the ionized helium absorptions. As O dwarfs evolve, the more massive ones become O g iants and supergiants. The high luminosities result in line-driven winds that can eventually cut the stellar masses by large fractions. As a result, O stars commonly have Orion molecular clouds 296 O \u0001 Orion Nebula A colour composite of infrared images taken with the Very Large T elescope (VLT) at Cerro Paranal, showing the central r egion of the Orion Nebula. The four bright, young T rapezium stars are prominent in the middle of this view. The Orion Nebula is a region of ongoing star formation. O AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:02 pm Page 296"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Ozma, Project emission lines in their spectra. Those with hydrogen emis- sion are called Oe stars, while those with ionized helium and doubly ionized nitrogen are OF STARS . Emission line and ‘Of ’ behaviour increase with increasing luminosity. Ultraviolet (and even optical) P CYGNI LINES reveal wind speeds of up to 4800 km/s (3000 mi/s) and mass-loss rates of up to 10 \u0001 5 solar masses per year. As O stars evolve, the lower masses turn into class M helium-fusing supergiants. Above about 60 solar masses, however, high mass-loss rates make the stars’ evolutionary paths stall as B supergiants and luminous blue variables, which then become Wolf–Rayet stars that have been stripped of their outer hydrogen envelopes. As evolution proceeds past helium fusion, O stars develop iron cores that collapse to produce Type II supernovae, whose stellar remains become neutron stars or black holes. As a consequence of both low formation rates and short lifetimes, O stars are rare. Less than one of every 3 million main-sequence stars is an O star. The odds of finding one nearby are small, and most are very far away. Short lifetimes also mean that O stars do not move far from their birthplaces, and they are commonly associated with star-forming interstellar clouds of gas and dust. Since their high temperatures result in hard ultraviolet radiation, O stars can ionize their surroundings and create diffuse nebulae; the most famous is the Orion Nebula, which is ionized by the Trapezium quartet. Because star formation takes place in the Galaxy’s disk, O stars are found almost exclusively along the Milky Way, the relatively nearby ones helping to create Gould’s Belt. Most O stars are members of unbound OB ASSOCIATIONS (from which they are moving away), the best known con- centrating in Orion, Scorpius, Centaurus and Perseus. A good fraction of O and B stars form in binary systems, many with components of similar mass. Encounters between stars in multiple systems, or between pairs of close binaries, can eject individuals from the associations at high v elocities. Supernovae may also create such R UNAWAY STARS . In a double star, the more massive star evolves first and explodes. Supernovae can explode off-centre, which can drive the resulting neutron star away at high speed, the companion fleeing in the other direction. It is estimated that as many as 20% of the O stars are runaways; the best known are \u0002 Columbae and AE Aurigae, which were eject- ed from the Trapezium cluster 2.5 million years ago. O stars, plus those of classes B0 to B1, produce much of the ionizing radiation that energizes the thinner inter- stellar clouds. Their high mass-loss rates also return a g reat deal of matter to the interstellar medium (red giant winds and planetary nebulae producing the bulk). Since the stars are being stripped by winds, much of this mat- ter has been processed by energy-generating nuclear reactions to create new helium, nitrogen and carbon. The eventual supernovae then produce most of the heavy elements in the Universe, including all the iron. Moreover, the shock waves from wind-blown O star bu bb les and from the eventual supernovae aid in the compression of the interstellar gases, and therefore help form new stars. Examples of O stars include \u0003 Puppis 05 Ia, \u0004 Pe r sei O7.5 Iab, \u0005 Orionis 09 V, \u0003 Orionis 09 Ib and \u0003 Ophiuchi 09 V. outer asteroid belt See EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT outer planets Any of the planets with orbits that lie beyond that of the ASTEROID BELT ; the outer planets are Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. With the exception of Pluto, the outer planets have low densities in comparison to the inner, TERRESTRIAL PLANETS and possess ring systems and comparatively large numbers of satellites. The differences between the two types of planet are thought to be caused by their respective distances from the Sun during the early formation of the Solar System. outgassing Emission of V OLATILE material from planetary bodies. Terrestrial bodies, formed from primeval Solar System material, contained volatile material. When these bodies were heated by radioactivity, DIFFERENTIATION occurred, and some of the volatile material escaped to the surface. This process, termed ‘outgassing’, produced planetary atmospheres. Overwhelmingly Large Telescope (OWL) Largest optical telescope yet proposed: a 100-m (330-ft) aperture instrument whose reflecting surface would be formed by 1600 hexagonal mirror-segments, each 2.3 m (91 in.) across.

Its properties include: atomic number 8; atomic mass of the natural element 15.9994 amu; melting point 54.8 K; boiling point 90.2 K. It was discovered in 1774 by the English chemist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804). Oxygen has eight ISOTOPES ranging from oxygen-13 to oxygen- 20; three of these are stable and form the naturally occurring element (oxygen-16 99.8%, oxygen-18 0.2% and oxygen-17 0.1%). Oxygen comprises 21% by volume of dry terrestrial air. Under normal terrestrial conditions, it exists as a colourless, odourless gas composed of the diatomic mole- cule O 2 . In this form it is essential to aerobic life. It is also essential to life as water, when it is combined with hydro- gen, and as the carbohydrates, when combined with h ydrogen and carbon. Oxygen makes up about two-thirds of the human body. The allotrope of oxygen, O 3 , known as ozone, is present in small quantities high in the atmos- phere, where it absorbs solar ultraviolet light at wave- lengths shorter than 320 nm. It thus protects life on the surface from that damaging radiation. The ozone layer though is currently being depleted to dangerous levels, particularly over the polar regions, through the action of man-made fluorocarbons and other pollutants. Oxygen is a highly reactive element and is thus an important constituent of the Earth and other terrestrial planets in the form of oxides of silicon, calcium, iron, alu- minium and others. It makes up 49% by mass of the Earth’s crust. It is used in liquid form as part of the fuel for liquid-fuelled rockets. Oxygen plays an important role in the CARBON – NITROGEN – O XYGEN CYCLE , which is the major helium-producing nuclear reaction in stars more massive than the Sun. Oxygen burning to produce silicon occurs at temperatures over 2 \u000b 10 9 K ( see NUCLEOSYNTHESIS ) in high-mass stars.

Pallas Second MAIN - BELT ASTEROID to be discovered, and so numbered 2. It is the second-largest asteroid, after CERES . Pallas’ mean density is about 4.2 g/cm 3 , which is greater than that of stony meteorites or common terrestrial rocks, indicating that it contains a metallic component similar to nickel–iron meteorites. Despite its size, Pallas is by no means spherical in shape, measuring about 570 \u0001 525 \u0001 482 km (354 \u0001 326 \u0001 300 mi). Its mass is about 3.2 \u0001 10 20 kg (0.43% the mass of the Moon). Pallas is also noteworthy in that its orbital plane is tilted substantially relative to the ecliptic (inclination almost 35°). pallasite One of the two subdivisions of STONY - IRON METEORITES , the other being the MESOSIDERITES . Pallasites are an approximately equal mixture of iron–nickel metal and silicates, predominantly olivine. They are presumed to represent material from the core–mantle boundary of their parent bodies. There are currently 50 known pallasites, almost all of which are Main Group (MG) pallasites. MG pallasites have oxygen isotope compositions similar to those of the HOWARDITE – EUCRITE – DIOGENITE ASSOCIATION achondrites. Palomar Observatory Fo rmerly known as Mount Palo- mar Observatory, this world-famous astronomical facility is at an elevation of 1706 m (5597 ft) in the San Jacinto Mountains 80 km (50 mi) north-east of San Diego, Cali- fornia. It was planned in 1928, when MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY ’s success with the 100-inch (2.5-m) HOOK - ER TELESCOPE was fresh in the minds of US astronomers. The Rockefeller Foundation was persuaded to fund a 200-inch (5-m) instrument, eventually named the HALE TELESCOPE , to be owned by the CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY (Caltech). The observatory was founded in 1938, but construc- tion was delayed by World War II, and it was not until 1948 that the Hale Telescope began work, and another year before it was declared finished. Also in 1948, the 1.2-m (48-in.) Palomar Schmidt telescope (now known as the OSCHIN SCHMIDT TELESCOPE ) became operational. During the 1950s and 1960s, these two instruments proved a formidable combination, giving the USA an unassailable position in world astronomy. Several smaller telescopes were also built at Palomar. The observatory is still owned by Caltech. While the LIGHT POLLUTION from San Diego limits the observational programmes, the Hale and Oschin telescopes remain effective instruments. Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS) Systematic photographic SURVEY of the sky north of \u0002 30º made with the 1.2-m (48-in.) Oschin Schmidt telescope of the Palomar Observatory, jointly funded by the National Geographic Society. The First Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS I) consists of about 2000 glass plates (1000 in each blue and red colours) observed between 1948 and 1957; it was completed in the 1970s by the ESO Schmidt Telescope in Chile (for the red part) and UK Schmidt Telescope in Australia (for the blue part). The Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (POSS II) was carried out in the 1990s in three colours (blue, red and infrared). Both surveys have been digitized and are known as the Digitized Sky Surveys (DSS I and DSS II). Pan Innermost satellite of SATURN , discovered by Mark Showalter (1957– ) in 1990 amongst images obtained a decade earlier by the VOYA GER 2 spacecraft. Pan is about 20 km (12 mi) in size. It has a circular equatorial orbit within the ENCKE DIVISION in Saturn’s rings. It takes 0.575 days to complete a circuit of the planet, at a distance of 133,600 km (83,000 mi) from its centre. The name Pan is also applied to a large crater, c .90 km ( c .60 mi) long, on AMALTHEA . Pandora One of the inner satellites of SATURN , discovered in 1980 by S.A. Collins and others in VOYA GER 1 images. It is irregular in shape, measuring about 110 \u0001 85 \u0001 60 km (68 \u0001 53 \u0001 37 mi). Pandora has a near- circular equatorial orbit at a distance of 141,700 km (88,100 mi) from the planet’s centre, where its orbital period is 0.629 days. It appears to act as a SHEPHERD MOON to the outer rim of the F RING . See also PROMETHEUS panspermia Theory that life on Earth did not originate here, but arrived from the depths of space. It originated with Svante ARRHENIUS , who in 1908 suggested that light from stars could blow microscopic germs from a world orbiting one star to another world orbiting another star. Panspermia never met with much support, but the idea never quite disappeared, and was rekindled in 1996 when a team of NASA scientists claimed to have found evidence for the presence of fossilized ancient microorganisms in a Martian meteorite ( see ALLAN HILLS 84001). Computer models have shown that rocks launched from Mars by a large meteorite impact can immediately enter Earth-crossing orbits if they are ejected just margin- ally faster than Mars’ escape velocity, and that about 1 in 10 million of Martian meteorites that reach the Earth may have spent less than half a Martian orbital period, about one year, in space. Any microorganisms aboard such meteorites might just have survived the rigours of space travel and entry through Earth’s atmosphere (microorgan- isms known as extremophiles are now known to have extraordinary survival attributes – see LIFE IN THE UNI - VERSE ). Over the lifetime of the Solar System, the inner planets are calculated to have exchanged tens of thou- sands of tonnes of material in this way. Fred HOYLE and N. Chandra Wickramasinghe (1939– ) have reformulated the idea of panspermia to suggest that life was brought to the Earth by a comet, and that interstellar dust ‘grains’ have a bacterial component. Their main argument is that the origin and evolution of life involves too many steps, each in itself inherently improbable, to have happened on Earth – instead, it needs all the ‘resources of space’. Life will be carried around, mainly by comets, and take root wherever conditions are suitable. Evidence is growing that the composition of giant mol- ecular clouds, particularly in star-forming regions, is far richer that previously supposed ( see INTERSTELLAR MOLE - CULES ).

However, only a tiny amount of such prebiotic material needs to survive to seed planets with the chemical basis of life. Life is more likely to have disseminated in this manner than by the transfer of living organisms by panspermia. Panspermia theories have, however, received support from the detection in 2001 of microorganisms in the stratosphere, at a height of 41 km (25 mi). parabola Open curve, one of the CONIC SECTIONS , obtained by cutting a cone in a plane parallel to the side of the cone. It can be regarded as an ELLIPSE with only one focus, an infinite major axis and ECCENTRICITY of 1. A parabolic orbit is used for some of the LONG - PERIOD COMETS . These comets are observable over only a short arc of their orbits near perihelion, and it is often not possible to distinguish between exactly parabolic orbits and extremely elongated elliptical orbits. paraboloid Three-dimensional surface generated by rotating a PARABOLA about its own axis. This shape is commonly used for the primary mirror in NEWTONIAN TELESCOPES in preference to a simple spherical surface. Images formed by a spherical mirror suffer from SPHERICAL ABERRATION because incident light at different distances from the axis come to a focus at different points. A paraboloid overcomes this problem and produces a diffraction-limited image for a point object, such as a star, that is in the centre of the field of view. Incoming light that is not parallel to the axis of the paraboloid (that is, from objects away from the centre of the field) produces images that suffer from COMA . Newtonian telescopes often have long focal lengths to reduce this effect. parallax (symbol \u0001 ) Change in apparent position of a celestial object, relative to its background, caused by a shift in the position of the observer. When observed six months apart from opposite sides of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the position of a nearby star relative to the more distant background stars, will appear to have shifted by an angle \u0002\u0003 . Half of this angle, \u0001 , is the ANNUAL PARALLAX (heliocentric parallax), which is also a measure of the angular size of the radius of the Earth as seen from that star. If a star’s parallax can be measured, then its distance can be determined. A unit of stellar distance is the PARSEC – the distance at which a star would have a parallax of one second of arc; it is equivalent to 3.2616 l.y. This is an example of TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX , where a baseline of known length is used to make separate observations of a celestial object, the choice of baseline depending on the distance of the object in question. For objects in the Solar System, the radius of the Earth is used as a baseline, producing a measure of DIURNAL PARALLAX (geocentric parallax). SOLAR PARALLAX is the Sun’s geo- centric parallax, in other words the angular size of the Earth’s equatorial radius from a distance of one astronom- ical unit (1 AU). Another method of determining stellar distances uses a star’s spectral type and is known as SPEC - TROSCOPIC PARALLAX . The astrometric satellite HIPPARCOS , which operated between 1989 and 1993, extended the range of accurate parallax distances by roughly 10 times, at the same time increasing the number of stars with good parallaxes by a much greater factor. Of the 118,218 stars in the Hippar- cos catalogue, the distances of 22,396 are now known to better than 10% accuracy. Prior to Hipparcos, this num- ber was less than 1000. The companion Tycho database, from another instrument on the satellite, provides lower accuracy for 1,058,332 stars. This includes nearly all stars to magnitude 10.0 and many to 11.0. See also DYNAMICAL PARALLAX ; SECULAR PARALLAX Paranal Observatory Second of the two observing sites of the EUROPEAN SOUTHERN OBSERVATORY (ESO), inau- gurated in the early 1990s.

It is home to the four instruments that comprise the VERY LARGE TELESCOPE (VLT). A nearby 2.5-m (100-in.) VLT Survey Telescope (VST) will provide imaging data at optical wavelengths, while the 4-m (157-in.) UK–ESO Visible–Infrared Sur- vey Telescope for Astronomy being built at Paranal will provide infrared imaging data. parhelion (mock Sun, sundog) Atmospheric phenomenon produced by refraction of sunlight by ice crystals in cirrus clouds at altitudes of 10–15 km (6–9 mi), near the top of the TROPOSPHERE . A parhelion appears level in elevation above the horizon with the Sun, at an angular distance of 23º from it. There may be a single parhelion, or two parhelia lying to either side of the Sun in the sky. Sometimes parhelia are visible as brighter patches on a HALO around the Sun. As with the halo, parhelia can show strong colour, with red towards the Sun, blue away from it. Parhelia commonly appear as elongated bars of light. Close to full moon, the equivalent lunar phenomenon, called a parselene, may be visible. Paris Observatory Second-oldest observatory in the world, after COPENHAGEN OBSERVATORY . The ‘Observa- toire de Paris’ was commissioned by King Louis XIV principally for geodesy, and built in 1667. Many famous 17th-century astronomers worked there, including Jean Picard, Ole RÖMER , Christiaan HUYGENS , Nicolas-Louis de LACAILLE and Urbain LE VERRIER . Four generations of the CASSINI FAMILY were observatory directors in the 17th and 18th centuries, and such was its importance to geo- desy that the Paris meridian remained the origin of longi- tude until 1884. The observatory helped to create the metric system and instigated the CARTE DU CIEL project. Today, Paris Observatory houses a collection of astro- nomical instruments from the 16th century to the 19th; it is also a modern research institution, operating MEUDON OBSERVATORY and the NANÇAY RADIO TELESCOPE .

When a total solar eclipse occurs, a partial eclipse is visible in a broad band to either side of the narrow track of totality; before and after totality, the eclipse is, of course, partial. LUNAR ECLIPSES may also be partial: in such cases, only the northern or southern edge of the Moon enters the UMBRA of Earth’s shadow. particle physics Branch of physics that studies ELEMENTARY PARTICLES , fields and their interactions. Physicists use nuclear accelerators to speed up particles such as electrons or atomic nuclei and crash them into other atomic nuclei. The results of the collisions are examined to investigate the internal structure of the particles themselves. Linear accelerators use magnets to guide charged particles through tunnels, and the particles are accelerated using radio frequency energy. These particles can be accelerated to close to the speed of light. Other accelerators use large rings to store and accelerate particles, focusing and guiding the particles by a complex array of magnetic and electric fields until they are moving fast enough, and then guiding them to the targets. Once the particles collide with the targets, the prod- ucts of the collisions are detected and studied by a com- plex array of detectors. Some detectors are made up of cloud chambers in which a fast particle leaves a trail of condensation as it moves through the chamber. The shape and length of the condensation trail can be used to determine the speed, mass and charge of the particle. Other detectors are made of scintillators that emit pho- tons as a fast elementary particle collides with the scintil- lating material. These photons are then detected by an array of phototubes trained on the scintillation chamber. The intensity and direction of the photons can be used to identify the particle. Some of the most productive particle physics accelera- tors are the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), the CERN Accelerator, and the Jefferson Laboratory (for- merly called CEBAF) Accelerator in Virginia. Facilities like these are being used to test the standard model of par- ticles and fields. These accelerators are not powerful enough to test cosmologically interesting interaction ener- g ies. The superconducting super-collider (SSC) was a powerful accelerator facility to be built in the USA, but it w as cancelled due to lack of funding. The SSC could have accelerated particles up to energies necessary to test ele- mentary particle theories further. In order to test cosmo- logically interesting energies, an accelerator with a radius of 70 l.y. would have to be constructed! The theoretical side of particle physics attempts to understand all of the particles resulting from collisions and all of the interactions by using the QU ANTUM THEORY . Theorists work closely with experimentalists in trying to predict collision cross-sections, interaction strengths and resonances that may be observed in the particle accelera- tors. The standard model for elementary particles is being heavily tested in existing accelerators. Underlying all of this effort is the search for a correct GRAND UNIFIED THEO - RY (GUT) of elementary particles, and perhaps even a QU ANTUM THEORY OF GRAVITY .

Payne-Gaposchkin, Cecilia Helena (1900–1979) English astronomer who spent all of her life in America, mainly at Harvard, studying stellar evolution and composi- tion. Cecilia Payne was at Cambridge University intending to study botany when, in 1919, her scientific interest was dramatically switched to astronomy when she heard Arthur EDDINGTON announce the results of the Greenwich eclipse expedition that confirmed a prediction of general relativity. In 1923 she left for America, Harlow SHAPLEY having offered her a post at Harvard College Observatory. Pa yne’s Harvard thesis on stellar atmospheres was hailed by Otto STRUVE as ‘the most brilliant PhD thesis ever written in astronomy’. In it she showed how a star’s spectral type was related to its surface temperature, thus adding another dimension to the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM . She also found that hydrogen and helium are the most abundant elements in stars (though there was initially doubt about this result), and that, these elements apart, the relative abundances of the elements in normal stars strongly match the composition of the Earth. In 1934 she married Sergei Illarionovich Gaposchkin (1898–1984), an émigré astronomer from the Ukraine who had joined the staff of Harvard the previous year. T ogether they embarked on a huge programme of measur- ing the magnitudes of variable stars, the results appearing in a catalogue published in 1938. A similar study of vari- ables in the Magellanic Clouds appeared in 1971. P Cygni Highly luminous V ARIABLE STAR of apparent visual magnitude 5. P Cygni is a galactic B1 supergiant 724,000 times more luminous than our Sun, with an effective surface temperature of 19,300 K. Its distance is 5900 l.y., its radius 76 solar radii and its mass 50 times that of the Sun. P Cygni appeared as a reddish star of visual magnitude 3 in 1600–1606, faded to magnitude 6 in 1620, rose again in 1655–59 and then fluctuated around minimum until 1715. In modern times P Cygni appears as a relatively constant, yellowish-white star. Its spectral signature, the ‘P Cygni profile’, is seen particularly in O, B and A supergiants showing episodes of catastrophic mass loss. P Cygni’s characteristic spectrum exhibits strong EMIS - SION LINES accompanied by equally strong variable blue- shifted ABSORPTION components. These P CYGNI LINE profiles are seen in the strongest BALMER h ydrogen lines, in ionized helium, nitrogen, silicon, sodium and iron. The episodic nature of the mass loss, witnessed in the 17th century although not then understood, is supported by the detection of a radio arc interpreted as the remnant of an earlier gas shell. Calculations suggest that P Cygni’s evolutionary track across the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM may be exceptional. P Cygni lies on the border-line below which STELLAR EVOLUTION brings other massive stars into the red supergiant phase. It is classified as an S DORADUS STAR ; it would have been the prototype for the class if its characteristics had been recognized earlier and if its name had not already been given to specific spectral features. P Cygni line Stellar EMISSION LINE flanked to the shorter wa v elength (blue) side by an ABSORPTION line; it is indicative of a powerful wind. The emission comes from a hot circumstellar gas. Since the gas flows in all directions, Doppler shifts average out, and the emission, though broadened, is centred at the line’s laboratory wa v elength (ignoring the star’s radial velocity). The gas directly in front of the star, however, absorbs starlight and is Doppler shifted to the blue. The absorption’s short- wa ve limit gives the wind’s velocity and its strength the wind’s density. Peacock The star \u0001 Pa v onis, visual mag. 1.94, distance 183 l.y., spectral type B2 IV. It is named after its parent constellation Pavo, which represents a peacock. Pease, Francis Gledheim (1881–1938) American astronomer and instrument-maker who pioneered techniques of optical interferometry. He spent most of his career at MOUNT WILSON OBSERVATORY (1904–38), playing a major role in the design and construction of the observatory’s most famous instruments, including its STELLAR INTERFEROMETER (1920). Pease used the interferometer to make the first measurement of the diameter of a star outside the Solar System, finding the diameter of Betelgeuse to be 0 \u0002 .047. peculiar A star See AM STAR ; AP STAR Peebles, (Phillip) James (Edwin) (1935– ) Canadian astronomer and cosmologist who interpreted the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND (CMB) and has studied the LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE of the Universe. Peebles obtained his PhD at Princeton, studying under Robert DICKE , and has worked there ever since. In 1965, unaware of earlier work by George GAMOW and colleagues, Dicke, P eebles and others published a paper in which they inter- preted the CMB, discovered by Arno PENZIAS and Robert Wilson, as radiation left over from the Big Bang. Peebles also calculated the levels of deuterium and helium that should now be present in a Big Bang Universe, results that agreed with the observed abundances. In the early 1970s, Peebles and Jeremiah Ostriker (1937– ) found evidence for dark matter. They calculated that the visible disk of a galaxy like the Milky Way could not remain stable for more than one galactic rotation unless it were constrained by the gravitational effect of an invisible halo of material. Peebles’ studies of the present- day distribution of galaxies and how it relates to irregulari- ties in the early expanding Universe resulted in the classic text The Large-Scale Structure of the Universe (1980). In 1979 Peebles and Dicke identified the so-called flat- ness problem: how, in standard BIG - BANG THEORY , could the DENSITY PARAMETER \u0003 have been so close to 1 from so early in its history? If \u0003 had been just a little larger, the Universe would long ago have collapsed in a ‘Big Crunch’; a little smaller, and by now the Universe would be a near-vacuum.

Soon after Galileo, he made some of the earliest observations of the four bright satellites of Jupiter (also 1610), becoming the first astronomer in France systematically to record their transits and eclipses. He recognized the value of these ‘satellite events’ for calculating terrestrial longitudes. Peking Observatory See BEIJING OBSERVATORY Pele Site of a large and persistent umbrella-shaped v olcanic eruption plume on Jupiter’s satellite IO . The plume was 300 km (190 mi) high when discovered on VOYA GER images in 1979; it was 400 km (250 mi) high in the late 1990s when seen by the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE and the GALILEO orbiter.

The central coolest, darkest region is termed the UMBRA . penumbral eclipse LUNAR ECLIPSE at which the full moon passes just north or south of the dark UMBRA of Earth’s shadow, producing little or no noticeable diminution in its brightness. During a penumbral eclipse, an observer on the Moon would see the Sun partially eclipsed by the Earth. Where the Moon’s penumbral passage is very close to the umbra, it can sometimes show a slight darkening at its northern or southern edge; the effect is difficult to detect visually but can be recorded photographically. Penzias, Arno Allan (1933– ) and Wilson, Robert W oodrow (1936– ) Respectively, German-American and American physicists turned radio astronomers who in 1964 discovered the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND (CMB) radiation. Penzias’ family emigrated to the United States in 1940; in 1961 he joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in Holmdel, New Jersey, to study satellite communications. Wilson helped set up CalTech’s Owens V alley Radio Observatory in the early 1960s; he joined Bell in 1963. That year, Penzias and Wilson began using a 6-m (20-ft) horn antenna to study terrestrial and extraterres- trial radio ‘noise’ that interfered with telecommunica- tions. During a survey of the Milky Way’s galactic halo, they detected a persistent signal with a wavelength of 7.35 cm that originated beyond the Milky Way and corre- sponded to an ‘excess’ antenna temperature of just 3 K. Theoretical astrophysicists, including Robert DICKE and Jim PEEBLES , and a group led by George GAMOW , had predicted and even searched for this CMB radiation as early as 1948. Penzias and Wilson were awarded the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics for their discovery of one of the strongest pieces of observational evidence for the BIG BANG THEORY . After discovering the CMB, they went on to detect carbon monoxide and organic molecules in interstellar dust clouds. perfect cosmological principle Hypothesis that on the large scale the UNIVERSE looks the same everywhere, in all directions and at all times. This principle was proposed in 1948 by Hermann BONDI and Thomas GOLD as the basis for their formulation of the STEADY - STATE THEORY (Fred HOYLE approached the theory from a different standpoint). Most modern cosmological theories assume the validi- ty of the ordinary ‘cosmological principle’ that on the large scale the Universe is homogeneous (looks the same everywhere) and isotropic (looks the same in every direc- tion). The perfect cosmological principle went further in asserting that the large-scale appearance of the Universe remains the same at all times. Since the galaxies are mov- ing apart, the perfect cosmological principle requires that new galaxies be formed at a rate just sufficient to maintain a constant average number of galaxies in each given vol- ume of space. This implies the continuous creation of matter at a very slow but steady rate, in the region of l0 \u0004 44 kg/m 3 /s, that is, about one proton per cubic metre of space every ten years. The perfect cosmological principle also implies that the Universe is infinite, with no beginning and no end, and that there never was a time when all matter was densely concentrated together (as the BIG BANG theory requires). It follows, too, that galaxies accelerate away from each other so that, despite being infinite, the Uni- ve r se has a ‘horizon’ beyond which galaxies cannot be seen because their light is too severely redshifted. The principle also asserts, by definition, that the laws of nature do not change with time (some cosmologists contend that this need not be valid in an evolving universe). The ‘timeless’ quality of the perfect cosmological prin- ciple made it attractive to many people, but it is now wide- ly believed to be untenable in the face of the present observational data.

The brighter the Cepheid, the longer is its period. The importance of this relationship lies in the fact that observed periods are distance independent, whereas apparent magnitudes are dimmed by distance according to the inverse square law. Absolute magnitude is related to luminosity and is the apparent magnitude as measured from a standard distance. The measurement of period indicates absolute magnitude, which may then be compared with apparent magnitude to indicate the distance of the Cepheid. Similar relationships are found in other types of pulsating variable star, most notably in the MIRA STARS , certain SEMIREGULAR VARIABLES and WVI RGINIS STARS .

He applied spectroscopic techniques to a wide variety of astronomical objects, including novae and Wolf–Rayet stars. Perseids One of the most reliable annual METEOR SHOWERS , active between July 25 and August 20. Activity is substantial between about August 8 and 14, following a slow rise in the first week of the month. Maximum normally occurs around August 12, when observed rates of 60 meteors per hour may be found. At peak, the RADIANT lies close to the ‘Sword Handle’ at the northern end of Perseus. As first demonstrated in 1866 by Giovanni SCHIAPARELLI , the shower is associated with Comet 109P/ SWIFT – TUTTLE . Observations during the 1970s suggested increasing peak Perseid activity, further borne out by strong returns in 1980 and 1981 when zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) reached 120 (as opposed to the more normal 80–90). Still more significant was enhanced activity, manifesting as an additional peak 18 hours or so ahead of the estab- lished maximum, from 1988 onwards, associated with 109P/Swift–Tuttle’s 1992 perihelion return. This early peak was a narrow feature, apparently resulting from encounter with a concentrated filament of recently released debris close to the comet, with enhanced activity occurring mainly in a 30-minute interval. In 1993 and 1994, the ‘early’ peak was at its most intense, producing numerous FIREBALLS and observed rates of up to 10 Per- seids per minute (equivalent to a ZHR as high as 300). Unusual activity was still evident, albeit less pronounced- ly, as late as 1997, some five years ‘downstream’ of the parent comet. Thanks to the stream’s high-inclination (113º.8) retro- g rade orbit, Perseid meteors are swift (66 km/s or 41 mi/s), and many are bright and leave persistent trains. The shower peak is usually a favourable time for meteor photography. The Perseids have been known since antiquity. Chi- nese records as far back as AD 36 July 17 mention them, and there are frequent accounts in Chinese, Korean and J apanese annals from the 8th century onwards. European observers in the early 19th century were certainly familiar with the ‘August meteors’. For many years, the Perseids w ere known traditionally as ‘the Tears of St Lawrence’ in memory of the Spanish martyr killed on 258 August 10, close to the date of the shower maximum.

According to KEPLER ’ S LAWS , the orbit of a planet around the Sun, or of a satellite around a planet, is an ellipse. In reality attractions by other planets and satellites, and by the non-uniform distribution of mass in the planets, cause a significant displacement of the position of a body from where it w ould be in pure elliptical motion. This displacement is the perturbation of the orbit, and it has periodic and secular components. The periodic components consist of fairly small short-period perturbations, with periods similar to the orbital periods, and much larger long- period perturbations, which are mostly caused by close COMMENSURABILITIES of the orbital periods. The most notable example is the so-called great inequality of Jupiter and Saturn, which is caused by their 5:2 commensurability. It causes variations of their longitudes with a period 938 years and amplitudes of 0º.36 and 0º.87 respectively. The secular perturbations are continual changes of an orbit in one direction, which generally cause the mean ellipse of the orbit to rotate in the direct sense, and cause the REGRESSION OF THE NODES around the reference plane of the orbit. These perturbations are the result of the long-term average a ttractions of the other bodies, and, for the satellites, by the flattened shape of their planets. For the planets there appear in addition to be steady changes of the ECCENTRICITY and INCLINATION of the orbit. In reality these changes are very long-period perturbations, with periods ranging from 25,000 to 2,000,000 years, but over the few hundred years of observations it is convenient to represent them as secular terms. Pe r turbations can cause very large changes in the orbits of comets. All the short-period comets probably originat- ed as long-period comets in the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune; they were perturbed into their present orbits following many close approaches to the outer planets. Petavius Lunar crater (25ºS 61ºE), 170 km (106 mi) in diameter, with rim components reaching 3350 m (11,000 ft) above its floor. It is a complex crater, with side-wall terracing and central peaks. Petavius is of sufficient age that meteorite erosion has removed its bright ray pattern. Its floor is fractured as a result of lava intrusion. Because of foreshortening, Petavius appears oblong, but its actual shape is more nearly circular. Petit-Prince Moon of the MAIN - BELT ASTEROID (45) EUGENIA ; it was the first such object to be discovered by direct telescopic observation from Earth, in 1998. ( DA CTYL , the small moon of (243) Ida, had earlier been discovered in images returned by the Galileo spacecraft. Occultation observations had previously revealed satellites around (6) Hebe, (18) Melpomene and (532) Herculina.) Petit-Prince is about 13 km (8 mi) across, and it orbits Eugenia once every 4.7 days at a distance of 1190 km (740 mi). Peurbach See PURBACH PHA See POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS ASTEROID Phaethon APOLLO ASTEROID with a particularly small perihelion distance (0.14 AU); number 3200. It was discovered in 1983 with data collected by the INFRARED ASTRONOMICAL SATELLITE . An origin as a cometary nucleus has been suggested, because it is securely associated with the GEMINID meteor shower on the g rounds of orbital similarity.

When close to QUA DRATURE , Mars shows a distinct GIBBOUS phase. These bodies exhibit phases because they do not emit any light of their own and only shine by reflected sunlight. The observed phase, which is sometimes expressed as a percentage or decimal fraction, depends on the relative positions of the Sun, Earth and the body in question. When the whole of the illuminated side is visible, the phase is said to be full (100%). When the illuminated side is turned away from the Earth, it is new. Between the two extremes, a gradually increasing or decreasing proportion of the disk is seen. From new, the phases progress through crescent, first quarter, gibbous to full and then through gibbous, last quarter, crescent to new again. See also PHASES OF THE MOON phase angle Angle between two lines joining the centre of a celestial object, usually a planet, asteroid or comet, to the Sun and the Earth.

Phase anomaly is unexplained, and it may be an atmospheric effect. phases of the Moon Proportion of the Moon that appears sunlit from the viewpoint of an Earth-based observer. PHASE may be described as a percentage or decimal. Specific phases occurring at significant points during the LUNATION may be defined as new moon, first quarter, full moon and last quarter. New moon occurs when the Moon is at the same longitude in the sky as the Sun, such that its un-illuminated side is presented to the observer: the Moon at this phase is completely dark. After new, the Moon emerges into the evening sky (east of the Sun) as a gradually growing (waxing) crescent. Approximately seven days after new, the Moon appears half lit and half dark; this phase is described as first quarter, and it occurs when the Moon is at QU ADRA - TURE 90º east of the Sun. As the Moon travels still further eastwards, its phase becomes gibbous (almond-shaped). Full moon occurs when the Moon is directly opposite (180º from) the Sun in Earth’s sky, thus appearing completely illuminated. T elescopically, at full moon shadows are absent and crater outlines are difficult to see, although surrounding ray sys- tems become prominent. F ollowing full, the Moon’s phase begins to diminish (wane) through gibbous to last quarter (again at quadra- ture, this time 90º west of the Sun). Thereafter, the wan- ing crescent draws ever closer to the Sun in the pre-dawn sky until new moon is reached and the next lunation commences.

Phobos Larger of the two moons of MARS , the other being DEIMOS , discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall. Phobos is irregular in shape, measuring about 27 \u0002 22 \u0002 18 km (17 \u0002 14 \u0002 11 mi), with a mass of 1.1 \u0002 10 19 kg, giving it an average density of 1.9 g/cm 3 . It has an orbit of low eccentricity (0.015) tilted at an angle of 1º.1 to Mars’ equator, at an average distance of 9380 km (5830 mi) from the centre of the planet. This gives it an orbital period of 0.319 days, which is less than the 1.026 days it takes Mars to rotate on its axis. In consequence, an observer on the surface of the planet would see Phobos moving eastwards across the sky, rising in the west and setting in the east less than six hours later, whereas Deimos moves slowly in the opposite direction. Physically, Phobos is quite similar to Deimos. It is a dark body (albedo 0.05), slightly red in coloration, and is thought to be a captured ASTEROID with a composition similar to a CARBONACEOUS CHONDRITE . Also like Deimos, it is locked in SYNCHRONOUS RO TA TION with Mars, such that its long axis is radially aligned with the planet. Spacecraft images show Phobos to have a heavily cratered surface. It shows cracks or lineations, which are thought to have originated from shocks produced by past impacts on this body by smaller asteroids, although a tidal cause is also feasible, given Phobos’ proximity to Mars. Tw o large craters on Phobos are named Hall and Stickney, the surname of the discoverer and the maiden name of his wife, respectively; another crater is named after the French mathematician Édouard Roche. Phoebe Outermost substantial satellite of SATURN , discovered in 1898 by William Pickering. It is near spherical in shape, measuring about 230 \u0002 210 km (140 \u0002 130 mi). With a RETROGRADE orbit (inclination 175º) and moderate eccentricity (0.164), it is likely to be a captured body related to the CENTAURS . It takes 550 days to orbit Saturn, at an average distance of 12.94 million km (8.04 million mi). Phoebe rotates on its axis once every 9.4 hours.

Phoenix See feature article Pholus CENTAUR object discovered in 1992. It is about 150 km (90 mi) in diameter. It has been catalogued as ASTEROID number 5145, although it may well turn out to have characteristics of a COMET . Pholus has perihelion near 8.7 AU and aphelion at 31.9 AU, meaning that it crosses the orbits of Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, rendering it dynamically unstable.

The device uti- lizes the photoelectric effect , whereby electrons are liber- a ted from a photocathode when struck by photons of electromagnetic radiation. If the energy of the photons is above a certain threshold level, the most weakly bound electrons can escape from their atoms and are attracted to a positively charged anode. This causes an electric current to flow which is proportional to the intensity of the radia- tion. Photoelectric detectors are therefore useful in mea- suring light intensity. photoelectric magnitude MAGNITUDE of an object measured using an electronic detector and a combination of filters to match a standard passband. If the Johnson System is used, the filters are typically in the U (ultraviolet), B (blue), V (visual), R (red) or I (near- infrared) wavelengths. photographic magnitude (mpg) MAGNITUDE of a star as recorded on a traditional photographic emulsion which has its peak response towards the blue end of the spectrum and records very poorly at wavelengths longer than 500 nm. The photographic magnitude differs significantly from the VISUAL MAGNITUDE (mv) recorded by the eye. photographic zenith tube (PZT) Fixed, vertically mounted telescope used for the determination of time and latitude by the observation of the transit of FUNDA - MENTAL STARS as they pass near to the ZENITH . The PZT contains a horizontal lens that focuses stellar images on to a pool of mercury from which they are reflected on to a photographic plate mounted on a moveable carriage. The carriage is driven during the exposure to compensate for the Earth’s rotation; at each star transit, four exposures are recorded through two complete rotations of the instrument and the exact time recorded. The north and south displacements between image pairs provide lati- tude, while east and west displacements give the time of transit. By comparing the position of the images on the plate with the clock times at which they are observed it is possible to detect minor variations in the rate of rotation of the Earth. PZTs have now been superseded by SATEL - LITE LASER RANGERS . photography, astronomical See ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY photometer Instrument with which astronomers can measure the intensity (that is, the brightness) and various other properties of visible LIGHT , and also of infrared radiation and ultraviolet radiation. The earliest instruments were visual equalization photometers and extinction photometers. In equalization photometers , the intensity of a star image is steadily reduced until it is judged to be equal in brightness to that of another star (natural or artificial) in the same field of view. The magnitude difference of the two stars is then 2.5 times the logarithm of the star’s reduced brightness expressed as a fraction of its original brightness. If the magnitude difference is great, a reduction in the intensity of the brighter source, by a known amount, to near equalization, may be required. This can be achieved by a reduction of aperture, use of polarized filters or use of an optical w edge. The eye can detect fairly slight differences in intensity between the astronomical source and the comparison source, so that reasonably accurate measurements can be made. Examples of this type of instrument are: the ZÖLLNER PHOTOMETER , where the brightness of the artificial source is changed using an optical wedge; the polarization photometer, where the reduction is carried out using polarized filters; and Danjon’s cat’s-eye photometer, where natural stars are used for comparison purposes, the brightness reduction being effected by using a combination of two prisms and a cat’s-eye diaphragm. The flicker photometer is a true equalization photometer, in which the equality of the artificial and real light sources is assessed by the absence of flicker between the two images, when viewed in rapid succession from the same position. In extinction photometers , an optical wedge or polarized filter, marked with a scale, is used steadily to reduce the intensity of the light source until it just becomes invisible. The position on the scale at which this occurs is noted, and in this way the brightness of the source can be determined. Although visual photometers have been employed to obtain some useful results in the past, and the human eye has the ability to detect a wide range of light levels, it is comparatively insensitive to very small changes in bright- ness. In most cases, a difference in brightness of about one-tenth of a magnitude between the known brightness of the reference source and the unknown brightness of the source under study is the best that can be achieved with a single measurement. Greater precision may sometimes be achieved by taking the average of a series of measure- ments. However, for the far greater accuracies now required in astronomical research, or in cases where the intensity is constantly changing or varying very rapidly, physical photoreceptors such as the PHOTOELECTRIC CELL , PHOTOMULTIPLIER tube or BOLOMETER must be used. In all of these devices the incident electromagnetic radiation is converted into an electrical signal, the magni- tude of which can be determined very precisely. In optical, INFRARED ASTRONOMY and ULTRAVIOLET ASTRONOMY , magnitudes are determined using photome- ters over a selection of wavelength bands. Present systems such as the internationally accepted UBV SYSTEM use a suit- able combination of a special filter and a photoelectric cell or photomultiplier tube (plus an electronic amplifier) to select light or other radiation of a desired wavelength band and measure its intensity. The UBV system of stellar mag- nitudes is based on photoelectric photometry. The photo- electric magnitudes denoted by U, B and V are measured at three broad bands, U (ultraviolet), B (blue) and V (visu- P Phoenix 306 PHOENIX ( GEN . PHOENICIS , ABBR .

The light inten- sity can be measured for a particular wavelength band as a g reatly increased (amplified) electrical signal. Magnitudes can also be measured for various infrared bands. Narrow- er-wavelength bands are used in the UVBY system. Photo- electric photometry can be used to study the light output from an isolated star or small region of the sky. Photomulti- pliers are available with photocathodes sensitive in the infrared, thus extending the wavelength bands investigated. In a typical photoelectric photometer, the light from the telescope is fed via a pinhole and a Fabry lens to the pho- tocathode of the photomultiplier tube (PMT). The pin- hole is located in the focal plane of the objective mirror or lens of the telescope. It effectively excludes all light except that from the object under examination. The Fabry lens ensures that the image is correctly positioned on the photo-cathode. Provision must also be made between the pinhole and the Fabry lens for a viewing eyepiece, to ensure that the object is centred in the pinhole, and for a set of standard colour filters. These, together with suitable circuitry for the PMT, are enclosed in a light-proof box, termed the photometer head, which is placed at the eye- piece position of the telescope. The current from the PMT is fed to the measuring equipment via a suitable amplifier. In older photometer systems, a simple meter or a chart-recorder was used to measure the amplified out- put from the PMT. Nowadays, most photometer systems employ a microcomputer, which, with peripherals, is used to receive, store, process and print the data. A wide variety of telescopes is used for carrying out photoelectric photometry. It is vital that the telescope and its mounting are sturdy enough to carry the photometer head, which can weigh a couple of kilograms. It is also essential that the object under study is kept in the centre of the pinhole during each observation, which will typically last for 30 seconds or more, so the telescope mounting must be accurately aligned and driven precisely at sidereal rate. Most astronomers use the technique of differential photometry, where the brightness of the object under study is compared with standard stars of constant, known brightness. Regular procedures are carried out whereby the object being studied, the comparison star(s), and the background sky alone are observed in a sequence. The contribution from the background sky is then deducted from the other readings, so that the true difference in brightness between the object and the comparison star(s) may be calculated. The time taken for each observation is typically a few tens of seconds, and usually a whole series of observations is made, and the average then taken. Of course, this may not be possible in the case of very rapidly va r ying sources. Where appropriate, the standard colour filters are used to obtain observations that can be reduced to one of the standard photometric systems (for example, UBV or UVBY), thus enabling data from one observatory to be accurately related to that from another. In recent years the use of silicon solid state detectors (such as charge coupled devices – CCDs) has increased the passbands of data regularly determined. photomultiplier Extremely sensitive electronic device used for measuring the intensity of light radiation. The photomultiplier, or photomultiplier tube (PMT), consists of a photocathode and a series of electrodes, known as dynodes, in a sealed evacuated glass enclosure. Photons striking the photocathode, which is kept at a high negative v oltage, eject electrons as a result of the photoelectric effect. These electrons are accelerated towards the dyn- odes, which are maintained at successively less negative potentials. Additional electrons are released at each dyn- ode, producing a cascading effect and thus amplifying the signal. Photomultipliers are used in many ground-based and space-borne instruments, including PHOTOMETERS , scanning SPECTROPHOTOMETERS and POLARIMETERS . photon Discrete packet or ‘quantum’ of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION . As well as having wave- like properties, radiation of frequency f can be regarded as a stream of photons each of energy E giv en by E = hf , where h is the PLANCK CONSTANT . A photon can thus be visualized as an elementary particle with zero rest-mass, zero charge and spin 1, which travels at the speed of light. The photon theory explains several aspects of the behaviour of electromagnetic radiation, including the spectrum of BLACK BODY RADIATION , the photoelectric effect and the COMPTON EFFECT . photosphere Pa rt of the Sun from which visible light is emitted; more generally, the region of any star that gives r ise to its visible radiation. Most of the Sun’s energy escapes into space from the photosphere. It is the lowest level of the solar atmosphere, below the CHROMOSPHERE , TRANSITION REGION and CORONA . About 500 km (300 mi) thick, the photosphere caps the convective zone within the SOLAR INTERIOR . The effective temperature of the Sun’s photosphere is around 5780 K, varying through its depth from about 9000 K at the base to about 4500 K. The continuum radiation of the photosphere is absorbed at certain wavelengths by slightly cooler gas just above it, producing the dark ABSORPTION LINES (called FRAUNHOFER LINES ), which are observed in the solar spectrum. SUNSPOTS , FA CULAE and the solar GRANULATION are observed in the photosphere. The in- and-out heaving motions, or oscillations, of the photosphere are used in HELIOSEISMOLOGY to decipher the dynamics and structure of the SOLAR INTERIOR . photovisual magnitude MAGNITUDE of an object measured photographically using a combination of filters and photographic emulsions that mimic the spectral response of the eye. Piazzi, Giuseppe (1746–1826) Italian priest and astronomer who in 1801 made the first discovery of an asteroid. He directed the observatory at Palermo (1790–1826), and established the observatory at Naples (1817). On New Year’s Eve 1800, he found a moving object and obtained three accurate positions for it. Carl Friedrich GAUSS used these observations and his own method for calculating orbits to determine that Piazzi’s new object, later named CERES , orbited the Sun between Mars and Jupiter – where BODE ’ SLAW had predicted the existence of a planet. Piazzi also compiled a catalogue of 7646 stars (1803–14) and discovered the large proper motion of SIXTY - ONE CYGNI (‘Piazzi’s Flying Star’), which encouraged Friedrich Wilhelm BESSEL to use that star to make the first measurement of stellar parallax. Pic du Midi Observatory French optical observatory bu ilt between 1878 and 1882 on the 2890-m (9470-ft) Pic du Midi de Bigorre in the southern Pyrenees on an isolat- ed site that enjoyed exceptional atmospheric transparency and stability. Despite its inaccessibility, the observatory’s 20th-century achievements include the mapping of plane- tary surfaces, the determination of Venus’ rotation period, preparation for the Apollo Moon landings, and the explo- ration of the solar corona using the CORONAGRAPH made by Bernard LYOT . Access to the observatory was greatly improved in 1951 by the installation of a téléphérique (cable car). The largest telescope now on the site, dating from the 1970s, is the 2-m (79-in.) Bernard Lyot Tele- scope, enclosed in an unusual near-spherical dome. Now that most French astronomers use larger overseas tele- scopes, the site has only limited scientific usage and is being redeveloped for public outreach. Pickering, Edward Charles (1846–1919) American astrophysicist, elder brother of William H. PICKERING , who as director of HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY (1876–1918) undertook a long-term programme of stellar photometry and spectral classification. These studies produced the Harvard Photometry , a catalogue of 4260 bright stars (1884), and the Harvard Revised Photometry (1908) for 45,000 stars.

Pickering invented the objective prism, which allowed spectra to be obtained quickly and for many more stars than previously possible. The Harvard collection of spec- tra was analysed by a large, mostly female staff of assis- tants, referred to at the time as ‘Pickering’s women’ (or even more unkindly, ‘Pickering’s harem’), several of whom – including Annie Jump CANNON , Williamina FLEMING and Antonia MAURY – became accomplished astronomers in their own right. The outcome of this work was the HENRY DRAPER CATALOGUE (1918), containing the spectral classifications of 225,000 stars. An important extension of this work was Pickering’s invention of the B – V COLOUR INDEX for stars, which he realized was related to its temper- a ture. This system was later extended by William W. MOR - GAN and Harold JOHNSON to measure the magnitude differences for eight colours of starlight (the UBVRIJKL system). Pickering’s studies of stellar spectra also resulted in his discovery (1889) of spectroscopic binary stars, the first being Mizar ( \u0001 Ursae Majoris). Pickering, William Henry (1858–1938) American astronomer who, like his elder brother Edward C. PICKERING , worked at HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY . In 1891 he organized the observatory’s stations at Arequipa, Pe ru and Mandeville, Jamaica. He discovered Phoebe, the ninth satellite of Saturn (1898), and compiled the first photographic atlas of the Moon to use coordinate grids to identify features (1903). In 1894 he helped Percival LOWELL set up Flagstaff Observatory, and became involved in Lowell’s Mars observation programme, and in particular in the quest for a trans-Neptunian planet, for which he published many predictions (1908–28).

Mountains on the Moon are generally produced by impact processes. Mons Pico was formed when an enormous impact created the IMBRIUM multi- r ing impact basin. Magma later poured into the basin, covering all but the highest peaks of the inner rings and being restrained by the outer ring. Mons Pico is one of the peaks that marks an inner ring. Other peaks include Montes Teneriffe and Montes Recti.

At magnitude \u0007 5.7, M33 is visible to the naked eye under exceptional conditions. Usually, however, its low surface brightness – the light is spread ov er an apparent area of 67 \b\t 41 \b .5 – makes detection more difficult than might be anticipated, even with optical aid. M33’s popular name comes from its appearance, with loosely wound spiral arms surrounding a small nucleus. HII regions and star clouds are visible in the spiral arms, and some of these have been assigned their o wn NGC/IC numbers. M33 has a diameter of 50,000 l.y. and lies at a distance of 2.4 million l.y. The 8th-magnitude M101 (NGC 5457) in Ursa Major is also sometimes referred to as the Pinwheel Galaxy; like M33, this is a face-on spiral galaxy with a compact nucleus. Pioneer Series of US spacecraft used for a variety of purposes. They achieved several notable ‘firsts’. Pioneer 1 w as the first US probe to go anywhere near the Moon. Pioneer 6 was the first to make a direct investigation of a comet. Pioneers 6 and 7 set a ‘longevity record’ for probes in solar orbit. The PIONEER VENUS Orbiter (sometimes called Pioneer 12) was the first to obtain detailed radar maps of almost the entire surface of Venus. P erhaps the best known are Pioneers 10 and 11, the first probes to pass through the asteroid belt. Pioneer 10 then became the first spacecraft to obtain close-range data from JUPITER , while Pioneer 11 made the first flyby of SATURN . Both of them are now well beyond the orbit of Pluto and heading out of the Solar System. They carry plaques in case they are ever picked up by some alien civilization.

The PIONEER V enus 1 orbiter (also known as Pioneer 12) was launched on 1978 May 20; it entered an elliptical orbit around Venus on December 4. From this 24-hour orbit, the radar mapper was able to observe almost the entire surface of the planet during one Venusian day. Eventually, the orbiter produced the first topographical map of V enus, covering 92% of the surface at a resolution of 50–140 km (30–90 mi). The maps revealed that most of V enus consisted of flat lowland plains, interspersed with continent-like highlands and volcanic mountains. The orbiter also returned ultraviolet images of the cloud tops and confirmed the absence of a magnetic field. The orbiter burned up in the atmosphere in 1992 October.

Planck, Max Karl Ernst Ludwig (1858–1947) German physicist who, in 1900, described the intensity of black-body radiation with the formula E = h \u0002 by asserting that radiation is emitted in discrete quantities called quanta ( see PHOTON ). He thus originated the QU ANTUM THEORY , for which he received the 1918 Nobel Prize for Physics.

Named after Max Planck, the craft was first called Cobras/Samba and will be launched in 2007 rather than 2003 as originally planned. Budgetary problems resulted in Planck being designed to fly piggyback on another ESA spacecraft, FIRST (see HERSCHEL SPACE OBSERVATORY ). Planck will operate at the L 2 Lagrangian point of the Earth–Sun system. Planck constant (symbol h ) Fundamental constant, named after Max PLANCK . It relates the quantum of energy of a PHOTON to its frequency. Its value is 6.626176 \u0003 10 \u0001 34 Js. Planck distribution Bell-shaped distribution of energy radiated from a BLACK BODY . It is given by Planck’s equation: where I \u0004 is the intensity at wavelength \u0004 per unit wa v elength interval, \u0005 is the refractive index of the medium (normally unity), k is BOLTZMANN ’ S CONSTANT , and T is the temperature. The peak of the distribution shifts to shorter wavelengths as the temperature increases ( see WIEN ’ SLAW ). This leads to the common experience that at moderate temperatures objects glow a dull red; they then change colour successively through bright red, yellow, white to blue-white as the temperature is increased. The total emitted energy, F , increases rapidly with temperature, leading to the STEFAN – BOLTZMANN LAW . At wavelengths significantly longer than that of the peak emission, the simpler Rayleigh–Jeans approximation (named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh (1842–1919) and Sir James JEANS ) may often be used in place of the Planck equation: At wavelengths shorter than the peak, the Wien approxi- mation may be used: Planck era See PLANCK TIME Planck scale Distance light can travel during one PLANCK TIME .

See also PLANET X planetar See INTERSTELLAR PLANET planetarium Hemispherical domed theatre housing a centrally mounted projector that can simulate the appear- ance of the constellations in the night sky at any time of the y ear and from any point on the surface of the Earth. There are now some 2500 planetariums around the world, visited each year by an estimated 92 million people. Planetariums provide a vital link to the general public about new devel- opments in astronomy, and many of them act as regional resource centres for local news and informed interpreta- tion of results from the research community. Precursors of the planetarium were the moving celes- tial globe, and the mechanical orreries of the 18th centu- ry (some of which were known as ‘planetaria’). From the mid-17th century were built hollow globes 4 to 5 m (13–16 ft) in diameter, from inside which a small audi- ence could view stars as small holes in the globe. Walther Bauersfeld (1879–1959) built the first modern planetari- um star projector while working for the firm of Carl Zeiss in Germany. The ‘Model I’ was completed in 1923 and demonstrated that year at the Deutsches Museum, Munich. The Model II was the first to use the familiar dumbbell configuration. The first public theatres were b uilt in Vienna, Rome and Moscow. The 1930 World’s F air in Chicago saw the Adler Planetarium open its doors; it remains one of the world’s leading planetari- ums. The London Planetarium, completed in 1958, was the first to have a concrete dome. Armand Spitz (1904–71) became the champion of the small planetari- um in the United States when, during the 1960s race to the Moon, he installed hundreds of small planetariums. In Japan, the optical manufacturers Seizo Goto and Minolta installed hundreds of planetariums around the country. During the early 1980s Evans & Sutherland developed a digital star projector. There are two general types of planetarium projector, opto-mechanical and digital. An opto-mechanical projec- tor houses ‘star-plates’ in one of two spheres, one north- ern and one southern hemisphere. A lamp or a cluster of fibre optics feeds light through the holes in the star plates; the light is projected on to the reflective inner surface of the planetarium dome, thus recreating an accurate repre- sentation of the night sky. The two spheres holding the star plates are mounted at opposite ends of a cage housing individual planet projectors. Using a complex gear arrangement, the correct position and motion of planets at any time in the future or in the past can be recreated on the planetarium dome. The use of the fixed star plates in opto-mechanical projectors gives an inherently Earth-cen- tred view of the sky, which is fine for most purposes. A digital star projector holds a stellar database in com- puter memory and includes distances to the nearest few thousand stars. Star points are generated by an electron gun similar to those found in cathode ray tubes. A large phosphor plate displays the image, which is projected on to the dome via a large fisheye lens mounted above it. The projector can display the constellations as seen from Earth, or move to other stars to view the sky from differ- ent vantage points. In addition to constellations, the pro- jector can create many geometrical shapes for projection on the dome. Digital projectors are more versatile than their opto-mechanical counterparts, but the star images they produce are not as sharp. Planetariums come in many sizes, ranging from 3 to 23 m (10–75 ft) in diameter. Small inflatable domes with portable star projectors enable small communities to experience a simple planetarium demonstration. Some schools and colleges house small permanent planetariums. Larger facilities, often associated with public science cen- tres, provide a rich variety of experiences and can be found in many major cities around the world. The majority of modern planetariums incorporate video projection to insert moving computer graphics within a starfield, significantly enhancing the visual effect. Many traditional planetarium projectors are being replaced with digital projectors. Planetariums used to be places to view the night sky as seen from Earth; many can now immerse their audiences in a universe of three- dimensional realism. Faster computer power and real- time image generation enable elaborate computer models of galaxies, star clusters and nebulae to be combined with superb modern images from large telescopes. planetary nebula EMISSION NEBULA associated with and deriving from a star, in principle having a disk-like appearance, similar to the telescopic view of a planet. About 1500 planetary nebulae are catalogued, perhaps one-tenth of the number in our Galaxy. Their radii range from that of our own Solar System to a few light-years. At the small end of the range the nebulae may appear point- like on direct images, and their true natures have to be inferred from their EMISSION LINE spectra. William HERSCHEL coined the name in 1785 from the resemblance of some of the nebulae to planets (Herschel had discovered Uranus just four years earlier). Herschel thought at first that planetary nebulae were unresolved g roups of stars like distant globular clusters, but in 1790 he observed NGC1514, a planetary nebula that looked like a ‘star of about the eighth magnitude, with a faint luminous atmosphere, of a circular form .... The star is perfectly at the centre....’ The particularly simple form of the nebula, and the strikingly central position of the very bright star, so much brighter than others nearby, con- vinced Herschel that true nebulosity existed, which, no matter how powerful his telescopes, could never be resolved into stars. The central stars of planetary nebulae are extremely hot, their temperatures can range from 20,000 K to 100,000 K or more. Their brightnesses, however, are rela- tively low for such hot stars – just 0.1 to 100 solar lumi- nosities – so they must, therefore, be physically small. In fact the stars are thought to be contracting down to become WHITE DWARFS . The material forming the nebula has been ejected from the star in the recent past, when it w as a RED GIANT , and is expanding outwards at velocities of up to 60 km/s (40 mi/s). In some cases the central star subsequently develops a high velocity stellar wind that sw eeps the central volume of the nebula clear of material and compresses it into a spherical shell. Projected against the sky, such a nebula can then appear similar to a smoke r ing, like M57, the RING NEBULA . Only some 10% of planetary nebulae have a circular shape. About 70% have a bipolar structure and two lobes. In other cases magnetic fields, rotation, binarity and/or P planetar 310 76-0339 \u0001 planetary nebula A Hubble Space Telescope image of the Ant Nebula (Mz 3), a planetary nebula in the southern constellation Norma.

There are several classification schemes for planetary nebulae. One of the more widely used ones employs six main classes labelled by Roman numerals, as follows: I star-like II smooth disk, subdivided into (a) brighter towards the centre, (b) uniform and (c) some ring structure. III irregular disk, subdivided into (a) very irregular and (b) some ring structure. IV ring Vi r regular VI anomalous A planetary nebula shines because of ultraviolet light emitted by the hot central star. The atoms of the nebular gas can be ionized by ultraviolet photons of sufficient energy. Hydrogen atoms, for example, can be ionized by photons with a wavelength of 91.2 nm or shorter. When the ion recombines with an electron it emits photons of light from a structured ladder of energy steps. Each ultra- violet photon input into the nebula produces a spectrum of photons out. Each central star has enough light output to ionize a cer- tain volume of planetary nebula. There may be gas beyond the visible boundary of the nebula, but ultraviolet photons do not reach far enough to make it visible. In fact within each planetary nebula numerous sub-nebulae exist, each corresponding to the ionization of a given type of atom or ion. Thus pictures taken in different optical spectral lines from different ions show stratification – the images of the planetary nebula are nested like a set of Russian dolls made of coloured glass. The Ring Nebula (M57) is a good exam- ple of this: the blue, green and red images are successively larger because each is dominated by a particular spectral emission from a different atom or ion. All the planetary nebulae are expanding. This can be determined from two techniques. The DOPPLER SHIFT of the optical spectral lines provides a measurement of the expansion velocity along the line of sight: values of 20 km/s (12 mi/s) are typical. The increase in size of the image of a planetary nebula on photographs taken over the years shows its expansion across the line of sight. The expansion in the radial and tangential directions (if assumed to be the same) can be combined to yield the dis- tance of the planetary nebula. The fact that the nebulae are expanding as the central stars fade means that plane- tary nebulae are relatively transitory objects, with lifetimes measured in tens of thousands of years. As there are approximately 10,000 planetary nebulae in our Galaxy, several must form each year.

Planetary nomenclature has been the responsibility of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) since 1919, when a committee was appointed to standardize the then chaotic lunar and Martian nomenclature. This nomenclature had developed since the 17th century, when the first selenographers had each devised their own systems for naming lunar features, a practice continued in the 19th century when the first maps of Mars were made. As a result of the IAU’s work, the first systematic nomenclature for the Moon was published in 1935, and a standard list of light, dark and coloured Martian features followed in 1958. The procedure assumed even greater importance with the dawning of the space age and the mapping of increas- ing numbers of planets and their satellites by space probes from the 1960s onwards. In 1973 the IAU established the present Working Group for Planetary System Nomencla- ture (WGPSN). The system that is used assigns a binomial name to a feature, comprising a ‘descriptor’ and a specific name. The descriptor is a Latin or Greek generic term for the type of feature, such as Mons for mountain or volcano and Fossa for a long, narrow depression or ditch. The specific name may be that of a famous person, a mythical or literary char- acter or a terrestrial place name. On each body, a particular theme is chosen for the specific names. For example, sur- face features on the moons of Uranus take their theme from the name of the parent satellite, which itself was cho- sen to be a character from the plays of William Shake- speare. Thus, on Oberon, features are named after tragic Shakespearean heroes, such as Macbeth and Hamlet, while those on Titania are named after female characters, for example the craters Elinor and Ursula. When the first images of a body are obtained, an appropriate theme is chosen and the most prominent fea- tures assigned names, usually chosen by those working closely on the project. Once more detailed work is under- taken, anyone can propose a suitable name for considera- tion. The names of political or military leaders are prohibited while other guidelines ensure that names should be simple, clear and unambiguous, that the system should be international in its choice of names and that, where possible, themes established in the past should be expanded on. planetary precession Small component of general PRECESSION caused by the GRAVITATIONAL FORCE exerted on the Earth by other planets.

It continues to fund novel research and to support public education in planetary science. planetesimal Solid body that orbits a young star; it is one of the ‘building blocks’ in a PROTOPLANETARY DISK from which planets form by A CCRETION . The term is generally applied to bodies large enough for their motions to be controlled by gravitational forces rather than by the drag of gas in the disk; they are roughly of kilometre size or larger. Planetesimals form by coagulation of grains of metal and silicates (and ices in the colder outer part of the disk). ASTEROIDS and COMETS are remnant planetesimals that avoided collisions with planets and survived, albeit with some metamorphism and collisional processing, to the present time. See also COSMOGONY Planet X Name given to a hypothetical tenth major planet, once believed to exist in the outer Solar System beyond the orbit of Pluto. In the late 19th century, Percival Lowell, William H. Pickering and others calculated orbits for a large planet that they believed was responsible for gravitational pertur- bations to the orbit of Uranus unattributable to Neptune. Lowell called this unknown body ‘Planet X’. In 1930 Clyde Tombaugh discovered PLUTO , but although its position was only five degrees from that pre- dicted by Lowell and its orbit was similar, it soon became obvious that the newly discovered planet was too small to be Planet X. Despite a continued search by Tombaugh, during which he surveyed the entire sky, no further candi- date was found. Over the following years a number of different orbital predictions were made for a tenth planet, the gravitational influence of which would explain the deflection of comets from the outer Solar System towards the Sun. However, apart from the discovery by Charles Kowal (1940– ) in 1977 of CHIRON , which orbits between Saturn and Uranus and caused some brief excitement, nothing was discov- ered. Further searches for a solution to the discrepancies in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune also failed to reveal any new planets. In 1989 the VOYA GER 2 spacecraft established a revised mass for Neptune and this, together with the discovery that the orbital anomalies of Uranus and Neptune could be the result of observational errors, removed the necessi- ty for the existence of a tenth planet. This was reinforced by the discovery in 1992 of the EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, none of which are planet-sized. The members of the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt are believed to be remnants of the original Solar System material, and some experts argue that Pluto and its satel- lite Charon really belong in this category. On 2000 November 28, a large minor planet was dis- covered in the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt at a distance of 43 AU from the Sun. Its apparent magnitude of 20 made it the brightest-known trans-Neptunian object other than Pluto. Initially known as minor planet (20000) 2000 WR106, the object has since been named VA R UNA by the International Astronomical Union. Subsequent observa- tions have revealed that it is dark compared to Pluto, indi- cating little surface frost, and about half its diameter, making it also the largest as well as the brightest of the trans-Neptunian population discovered so far, after Pluto. planisphere Easy-to-use, portable two-dimensional map of the CELESTIAL SPHERE , as seen from a particular lati- tude, showing which stars are visible at a given date and time. The planisphere comprises two disks, one a star map and the other an overlay containing an oval window. The two are connected at the centre and may be rotated relative to one another in order to select the desired date and time, which are displayed around their outer edges. The oval window in the overlay disk will then show those stars that are currently above the horizon. Plaskett, John Stanley (1865–1941) Canadian astronomer who began his career as a mechanic at the University of Toronto, eventually becoming the first director (1917) of the DOMINION ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY (DAO). He was an expert instrument b uilder who won fame for a high-resolution spectrograph he made for the DOMINION OBSERVATORY ’s 15-inch (380-mm) refractor and for his design of DA O’s 72-inch (1.8-m) reflecting telescope, the largest in Canada. He used the spectrographs he built to study stellar radial velocities, investigating spectroscopic binary stars and hot, young O and B stars; PLASKETT ’ S STAR is a massive spectroscopic binary system he discovered. His radial velocity studies helped to confirm the model of the Milky Way proposed by Jan OORT and Bertil LINDBLAD . His son, Harry Hemley Plaskett (1893–1980), was an accomplished solar spectroscopist who worked mostly in England. Plaskett’s Star (HD47129, V640 Mon) One of the most massive BINARY STARS known; it is located in the constellation MONOCEROS . In 1922 the Canadian astronomer John PLASKETT showed it to be a SPECTROSCOPIC BINARY with a period of around 14 days. The system comprises two blue SUPERGIANTS of SPECTRAL CLASS O. Each component has an estimated mass of around 50 solar masses. plasma Almost completely ionized gas, containing equal numbers of free electrons and positive ions, moving independently of each other. Plasmas such as those forming the atmospheres of stars, or regions in gas discharge tubes, are highly electrically conducting but electrically neutral, since they contain equal numbers of positive and negative charges. The temperature of a plasma is usually very high. The electrical currents flowing within a plasma mean that it carries with it an intrinsic magnetic field ( see MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMICS ). A plasma has been described as ‘the fourth state of matter’, the others being solids, liquids and gases. plasma sheet Region of hot plasma generally observed in the central regions of the extended magnetotail of a planetary MAGNETOSPHERE . The inner edge of the plasma sheet may extend to the dayside at high altitudes, just inside the MAGNETOPAUSE . The near-Earth plasma sheet plays a critical role in the dissipation of stored magnetotail energy during MAGNETOSPHERIC SUBSTORMS . The deposition of this energy into the polar IONOSPHERE drives spectacular auroral displays in these regions. During substorms, large sections of the distant plasma sheet are also sheared off. The resulting plasmoid is ejected at high speeds down the tail and into the SOLAR WIND . plasmasphere Region of cold, dense plasma that co- exists in approximately the same region of space as the RADIATION BELTS within a planetary MAGNETOSPHERE . It is populated by the polar wind, an upflow of plasma from the upper ionosphere. In the terrestrial magnetosphere, the outer boundary, known as the plasmapause, is observed as a sharp boundary at altitudes of between 3 and 5 Earth radii, depending on the level of geomagnetic activity; the plasmasphere co- rotates with the Earth below. plate-measuring machine Dedicated computer-con- trolled measuring machine used for accurately recording the positions and brightness of images on astronomical photographic plates. A typical plate-measuring machine P Planetary Society 312 P AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:06 pm Page 312"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"consists of a solid but moveable base, known as an x – y table, on which the plate to be measured is mounted. The photographic plate is scanned in a series of strips by shin- ing a beam from a light source through the plate and allowing the light transmitted to be collected by a detector such as a CCD . To record each strip, the plate is moved under the CCD in one direction (the y direction) by the x – y table. When each strip is complete, the table is stepped in the x direction by a single scan width ready for the next strip to be scanned. The entire operation is car- ried out in an environmentally controlled chamber provid- ing clean-room conditions and strict thermal stability during the scanning process. Plate-measuring machines, such as the Automatic Plate Measuring facility at Cambridge and the SuperCOSMOS machine at Edinburgh, are used for the systematic digiti- zation of photographic plates from major sky surveys. These have been undertaken over many years using tele- scopes such as the United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (southern sky) and the Palomar Schmidt (northern sky). Photographic plates are also often scanned to try to correlate optical images with objects newly discovered at other wavelengths, such as X-rays. This can be impor- tant when attempting follow-up observations. Other work involves measuring the positions of radio sources in order to link the radio and optical reference frames.

It is a complex crater that originally contained side-wall terracing and central peaks. Later, however, lava flooded the crater, covering the central peaks and rising high enough to cover most of the side-walls. On the western inner wall, a slumped block is visible, as are a few small craterlets in the lava floor. Platonic year Period of around 25,800 years that it takes the celestial pole to describe a complete circle around the pole of the ecliptic, due to the effects of PRECESSION . It is named after the Greek philosopher Plato ( c .427– c .347 BC ). Pleiades (Seven Sisters) Young OPEN CLUSTER in the constellation TAURUS . It has an apparent diameter of 1º50 \u0001 , which corresponds to an actual diameter of 7 l.y. It gets its popular name from the fact that seven of its component stars, which are termed Pleiads, could once be seen easily with the unaided eye on a clear night. These seven stars are named after Atlas and his daughters: the brightest is called Alcyone ( \u0002 Tauri), and the others are Maia, Atlas, Electra, Merope, Taygete and Pleione. Today it is easy to see six of the stars; Pleione is variable and may once have been brighter. It is thought to be unstable, because of its fast rate of rotation, and is throwing off shells of gas. The cluster probably contains as many as 3000 stars in total. The brightest stars in the Pleiades are highly luminous blue-white stars (B or Be stars). The less brilliant ones are mainly A and F stars. In 1995 a brown dwarf was detected within the Pleiades. Designated PPl 15, it has a surface temperature of around 2000 K. Since its discovery, other brown dwarfs in the cluster, including Teide 1, have been observed. Gas and dust surround the brighter stars and reflect the starlight, thus producing faint REFLECTION NEB - ULAE around the stars. The Pleiades is thought to be about 410 l.y. away from us. It is around 76 million years old. plerion (filled-in supernova remnant) Rare type of SUPERNOVA REMNANT (SNR), in which radiation is emitted from the whole area of the nebula, not just from the outer rim. The name derives from pleres , the Greek for ‘full’. In addition to their filled-in appearance, plerions have no shell structure and emit strongly polarized SYNCHROTRON RADIATION , which gives them a characteristic green-yellow glow if they can be detected in the visible. In the radio region their spectra are flat. It is possible that plerions may divide into two subgroups on the basis of the ratio of their X-ray to radio fluxes. The best-known example of a plerion is the CRAB NEBULA ; others include the radio source 3C 58 and the SNR in the nebula IC 443. The VELA SUPERNOVA REMNANT appears to be a hybrid between a plerion and more conventional SNRs. The cause of the difference between plerions and other SNRs appears to be that the former have a continuing source of high-energy electrons at their centres in the form of a pulsar. The electrons spiral around the complex mag- netic fields within the SNR and emit synchrotron radia- tion. The emission of the radiation reduces the electrons’ energies, and so the pulsar must continually supply them in order for the nebula to maintain its emission. The dearth of plerion-type SNRs indicates either that they result from unusual types of supernovae, or that they are only a brief phase during the life of a conventional SNR. Plössl eyepiece Telescope eyepiece with good EYE RELIEF and wide field of view (acceptance angle about 40º). The commonest form has two identical achromatic doublets ( see ACHROMAT ), but some quite different designs have been called ‘Plössls’. The eyepiece is named after the Austrian optician Simon Plössl (1794–1868). Plough Popular (chiefly UK) name for the shape formed by the seven main stars of Ursa Major: \u0003 (Dubhe), \u0004 (Merak), \u0005 (Phecda), \u0006 (Megrez), \u0007 (Alioth), \b (Mizar), and \u0002 (Alkaid). The name comes from the group’s resem- blance to an old horse-drawn plough. In the USA these stars are usually known as the Big Dipper . plume Rising, thermally buoyant material in the MANTLE of a TERRESTRIAL PLANET or large satellite. A plume pushes up LITHOSPHERE , causing uplifting of the planet surface. The upwelling plume material melts rock, and some of this magma may reach the surface and erupt as volcanic lava. Most plume material solidifies within the planet mantle and crust. plutino TRANS - NEPTUNIAN OBJECT that happens to have an orbital period 50% greater than that of Neptune, so that it occupies the 3:2 mean-motion resonance, as does PLUTO itself.

It is slightly smaller than Neptune’s largest satellite, TRITON , with which it may have much in common. The realization that Pluto is much smaller than originally assumed, together with the fact that it shares many properties with EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT objects, led to speculation that it would be stripped of its planet status. However, the INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION has decided that Pluto will continue to be classified as a planet. Pluto, like Neptune, was discovered as the result of a deliberate search. Towards the close of the 19th century, it w as suggested that minor deviations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were being caused by gravitational perturbations by a large outlying planet, which became known as PLANET X . In the early years of the 20th century, P ercival LOWELL and others made repeated attempts to locate it. Lowell died in 1916, and in 1929 Clyde T OMBAUGH w as recruited by the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, to continue the search. Tombaugh used a BLINK COMPARATOR to reveal the motion of any planet relative to the background stars on pairs of photo- g raphic plates taken a few nights apart. On plates taken on 23 and 29 January 1930, Tombaugh found a faint (mag- nitude 14) object within a few degrees of the predicted position, which was moving by the amount expected of a trans-Neptunian planet. The newly discovered object was named Pluto after the classical god of the underworld. Pluto was too distant and too faint for much to be learned about it during the next half-century. Even its size w as a mystery. Before it had been found, Pluto was assumed to be about ten Earth-masses, but upon discov- ery its faintness caused its estimated mass to drop tenfold. The 1978 discovery of Pluto’s satellite, CHARON , enabled Pluto’s mass to be determined as only about 0.25% of the Earth’s. Thus, Pluto is not massive enough to be responsi- ble for the apparent deviations in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which are now known not to be real, but to have stemmed from tiny errors in 19th-century observations. Finding Pluto near the expected position for a massive trans-Neptunian planet was essentially a matter of luck. The post-1992 documentation of hordes of Edge- wo r th–Kuiper belt objects orbiting between 30 and 50 AU means that it is quite impossible for an undiscovered major planet to be in the same region. Pluto’s orbit is more eccentric than that of any of the major planets. When Pluto is near perihelion it is closer to the Sun than Neptune, as was the case between 1979 Sep- tember 5 and 1999 February 11. Perihelion occurred on 1989 September 5, when Pluto was only 29.66 AU from the Sun. Its distance from the Sun will now increase until it reaches aphelion at 49.54 AU in 2114. Pluto’s orbital peri- od is exactly 50% longer than Neptune’s, so the two are in 3:2 orbital RESONANCE . Although Pluto’s orbit crosses Nep- tune’s, the 17º inclination of Pluto’s orbit means that their paths do not intersect. Pluto’s inclined orbit takes it 8 AU north of the ecliptic at perihelion, and 13 AU south of it at aphelion. Its orbital resonance with Neptune means that the distance between the two bodies is never less than 17 AU. Like Uranus, Pluto lies on its side, having an axial incli- nation of nearly 120º and, therefore, RETROGRADE rota- tion. This did not become fully apparent until after the discovery of Charon, which orbits in Pluto’s equatorial plane. Imaging by modern telescopes has revealed that not only does Charon keep the same face to Pluto (being in SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION ), but also Pluto itself always keeps the same face towards Charon. The two bodies are mutually tidally locked, so that Pluto’s rotation keeps pace with Charon’s orbital motion about it. Pluto and Charon are probably a product of a giant impact between two Edgeworth–Kuiper belt objects. They are the nearest thing the Solar System can boast to a double planet. This honour was formerly thought to belong to the Earth and Moon. However, Charon’s 19,636 km (12,202 mi) orbital radius is only about sixteen times the radius of its planet, whereas the Moon’s orbital radius is about sixty times the Earth’s radius. Moreover, Charon has 12% the mass of Pluto but the Moon has only 1.2% the mass of the Earth. Strictly speaking, no satellite orbits around the centre of its planet, but instead about the system’s centre of mass (or barycentre). For all other planet-satellite systems this point lies inside the planet. In the case of Pluto–Charon the barycentre lies between the two bodies in open space, but closer to Pluto because it is the more massive of the two. Repeated searches for small- er satellites of Pluto have failed to find any, and if Pluto does have any other companions, they must be less than about 100 km (60 mi) across. There is no direct information on the interiors of Pluto or Charon. However, the melting that would have been caused by a giant impact and the heating that must have occurred while tidal forces were bringing Charon into a near-circular synchronous orbit mean that both bodies are ve ry likely to have become internally differentiated ( see DIFFERENTIATION ). Pluto’s density suggests that below its icy mantle there is a rocky core containing about 70% of the planet’s mass, with possibly an iron-rich inner core.

Pluto’s surface is bright but with a surprising degree of contrast between its brightest regions, where the albedo is as high as 0.7, and its darkest spots, where albe- do drops to about 0.15. Spectroscopy has revealed that the surface consists of frozen nitrogen (presumably con- centrated as frost in the brightest regions), methane and carbon dioxide. There are also traces of ethane apparently dissolved within the nitrogen ice. Because the dark areas absorb more solar heat than the bright areas, they have a temperature about 20 K higher, and they are warmer than anywhere on Triton (at least while Pluto is near perihe- lion). The bulk of Pluto’s ice is likely to be water ice, but this has not been detected spectroscopically. Presumably it lies buried, even more completely than is the case on Tri- ton, beneath the more volatile ices. The presence of Pluto’s atmosphere was confirmed when the planet passed in front of a star in 1988. Nitro- gen, the most volatile of the surface ices, probably makes up the bulk of the atmosphere, with methane, carbon monoxide and ethane also present. The temperature con- trast between the dark and bright regions is likely to drive ferocious near-surface winds. There is perhaps a tenuous low-altitude haze layer, which could be a photochemically induced smog like those on Titan and Triton, caused by such substances as hydrogen cyanide, acetylene and ethane. Although Pluto’s atmosphere is insubstantial, the planet’s feeble gravitational hold means that it is particu- larly extensive. For example, an imaginary shell enclosing 99% of Pluto’s atmosphere would be about 300 km (200 mi) above the surface, whereas for the Earth the equivalent height is only 40 km (25 mi). Near perihelion, Pluto’s atmospheric pressure was comparable to that of Triton. Because of the eccentricity of Pluto’s orbit, however, it receives nearly three times as much solar warmth at perihelion than it does at aphelion. As it moves farther from the Sun (and, coincidentally, one pole moves into season-long shadow), much of Pluto’s present atmosphere is vulnerable to becoming frozen out on to the surface. Pluto Kuiper Express Mission planned by NASA to be launched 2004 December on a 12-year flight to the planet Pluto, using the final opportunity of gravity-assisted flybys en route. The craft would fly past Pluto at about 15,000 km (9400 mi) and take high-resolution images of it and its moon, Charon. The spacecraft would also explore some of the Solar System’s most distant bodies in the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt. If the craft reaches Pluto in 2016, the exploration of all the planets of the Solar System will have been completed within a timespan of 54 years, since Mariner 2 and Venus in 1962 December. Pluto K uiper Express will study the geology, geomorphology and potential atmospheres of both Pluto and Charon. Pogson, Norman Robert (1829–91) English astronomer who promoted a logarithmic scale of stellar magnitudes. Observing from the private observatories of J ohn Lee (1783–1866) and George Bishop (1785–1861), he discovered twenty new variable stars; he later worked at Oxford University’s Radcliffe Observatory (1852–60), and then as director of Madras Observatory. In the course of analysing historical light-curves for all known va r iable stars, he devised a way to make the magnitude scale mathematically rigorous (1856). Comparing the brightness ratios in the different magnitude scales then in use, he noticed that their average value was very nearly 100 1/5 , or 2.512, the ratio – known as Po gson’s ratio – between successive whole numbers on the modern magnitude scale. Pogson also discovered eight asteroids. Pogson step method Visual method of estimating the brightness of a V ARIABLE STAR relative to fixed-magnitude comparisons. It is based upon training the eye to recognize steps of 0.1 magnitude and thus requires considerable experience. For example, if there are two comparison stars A (magnitude 7.0) and B (7.6) and the va r iable is midway between them, its magnitude will then be 7.3. If it is estimated as 0.1 magnitude below A and 0.5 above B, then its magnitude will be 7.1, and so on. The method is generally less satisfactory than either the ARGELANDER STEP METHOD or the FRACTIONAL METHOD , b ut may be of practical use when a comparison sequence has yet to be established (as in the case of a nova, for example), when a sequence has wide magnitude gaps between suitable comparison stars, or when a magnitude must be extrapolated outside an existing sequence.

The polarimeter incorporates optically active components – optical elements that can change the polarization of the beam being tested. When unpolarized light is scattered by a rough surface, or by a cloud of gas or dust, it becomes polarized. By investigating the degree of polarization, it is possible to determine the characteristics of, for example, the surface or atmosphere of a planetary body. Polaris The star \u0001 Ursae Minoris, visual mag. 1.97, dis- tance 431 l.y., spectral type F5–8 Ib. It is a CEPHEID VARI - ABLE , but its fluctuations in output have slowly diminished ov er the past century and are now barely noticeable. The HIPPARCOS satellite detected a change in brightness of a few hundredths of a magnitude, with a period of 3.97 days. Polaris currently lies within 1º of the north celestial pole; precession will bring it to within half a degree of the pole around the year 2100, after which the separation will increase again. Small telescopes show that Polaris has an apparent companion of mag. 8.2. polarization In the wave description of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION , light consists of oscillating electric and magnetic fields at right angles to each other and to the direction of propagation. The direction of the electric vibrations can be at any angle around the direction of motion. Ordinary unpolarized light is composed of vibrations with the same amplitudes in all the directions. If the vibrations have greater amplitude in a preferred direction, then the light is said to be linearly polarized, ranging from partially to totally polarized. Some crystals transmit only one direction of vibration, thus converting unpolarized into linearly polarized light (Polaroid sunglasses use this property). Light reflected from a surface or scattered in a gas becomes partially polarized. Such polarization occurs in planetary atmospheres and through the action of interstellar dust grains. If the plane of vibration rotates systematically in the direction of motion, then the light is circularly polarized. If the amplitude of the vibration also varies then it is ellipti- cally polarized. Reflection from a metallic surface is a source of elliptical polarization. In astronomy, the occurrence of circularly polarized light is an indication of the presence of a strong magnetic field in the region where the light is emitted. Examples are found in the radio and visible emissions from pulsars and SUPERNOVA remnants (for example the CRAB NEBULA ) and also in MAGNETIC STARS . polar motion Small and irregular movement of the Earth’s geographic poles relative to the planet’s crust. It has to be taken into account when correcting positional measurements of stars made with instruments such as a TRANSIT CIRCLE . Polar motion is caused by the fact that the Earth’s axes of rotation and symmetry are not exactly coincident. Its magnitude is only of the order of around 0 \u0002 .3. See also CHANDLER PERIOD pole One of the two points on a sphere that lie 90º from its equator and that mark the extremities of its axis of rotation. The projection of the Earth’s north and south poles on to the celestial sphere marks the CELESTIAL POLES , which lie 90º north and 90º south of the celestial equator. The ecliptic poles lie 90º from the plane of the ecliptic and the galactic poles are 90º from the galactic plane. pole star Name given to the nearest naked-eye star to either of the CELESTIAL POLES , though most commonly used to describe the north pole star, POLARIS ( \u0001 Ursae Minoris). Because of the effects of PRECESSION , the positions of the celestial poles are gradually drifting, and during the last 5000 years the north celestial pole has moved from Thuban ( \u0001 Draconis) to now lie within 1º of P olaris, which will be at its closest to the pole in AD 2100. By AD 10,000 the north pole star will be Deneb and by AD 14,000 it will be Vega. The south celestial pole is currently marked by the fifth-magnitude star \u0003 Octantis. Pollux The star \u0004 Geminorum, visual mag. 1.16, dis- tance 34 l.y., spectral type K0 III. It is named after one of the mythological twins commemorated by the constella- tion Gemini, the other being CASTOR . Despite its designa- tion, Pollux is the brighter of the pair. Pond, John (1767–1836) English astronomer, the sixth ASTRONOMER ROYAL (1811–35) and director of Greenwich Observatory, whose equipment he greatly improved. He succeeded Nevil MASKELYNE , whom he had convinced to replace Greenwich’s old quadrant (which Pond showed was warped) with a more modern mural circle made by Edward Troughton ( see COOKE , TROUGHTON & SIMMS ). He also developed methods to reduce or eliminate instrumental errors in measuring star positions, much improving the accuracy of the observatory’s star catalogues. Pons, Jean-Louis (1761–1831) French comet-hunter who began his career (1789) as the door-keeper at Marseilles Observatory, where he learned astronomy. Using a telescope with a 3º field of view, and armed with excellent eyesight and a photographic memory for the starfields he constantly swept, he became one of the most successful comet-hunters of all time. Between 1803 and 1827 he discovered 37 new comets, including Comet Encke. Pons–Brooks, Comet 12P/ Short-period comet found by Jean Louis PONS in 1812 and rediscovered by William Brooks (1844–1921) in 1883.

Initial a ttempts to derive an orbit proved difficult, and the comet w as not recovered until 1858 March 9, when it was found by Friedrich Winnecke (1835–97). From observations at this return, an orbital period of 5.55 years was determined, and the comet was seen again at the next favourable return on 1869. In the early 20th century, the comet orbit came close to Earth, producing activity from the PONS – WINNECKID meteor shower in 1916, 1921 and 1927. Gravitational perturbation by Jupiter has since increased the perihelion distance and orbital period (currently 6.37 y ears), and 7P/Pons–Winnecke is now extremely faint.

The shower produced substantial displays in 1916 (100 meteors/hr), 1921 and 1927, each close to perihelion returns of the parent comet. Gravitational perturbations thereafter pulled the meteor stream orbit away from Earth. The shower was presumed to be essentially extinct until the occurrence of an unexpected outburst on 1998 June 27–28, when observed rates of a meteor per minute were seen for over 12 hours. The meteors are slow and come from a diffuse radiant in northern Boötes near the border with Draco. It remains to be seen whether further displays may occur. population index Observationally determined factor that indicates the relative abundance of METEORS in adjacent whole-magnitude intervals; it is used in determining METEOR SHOWER zenithal hourly rates (ZHR). High population index ( r ) values indicate that a shower has many faint meteors produced by small particles.

There are two main categories: P opulation I and Population II, with Population I stars being the younger. A further Population III has been added to represent the oldest, very massive, stars which have already exploded as SUPERNOVAE . The observational basis for the idea of stellar popula- tions originated with Walter BAADE . Baade obtained pho- tographs of galaxies, exposing blue- and red-sensitive emulsions in order to emphasize the contributions of dif- ferent-coloured light. He discovered that the central regions of spiral galaxies were smooth distributions of red light, from innumerable faint stars, whereas the spi- ral arms were patchy distributions of bright blue stars and nebulae. Elliptical galaxies had the appearance of the central regions of spirals. These two contrasting kinds of stellar material were the original Populations I and II. The distinction between the two populations is now explained in terms of STELLAR EVOLUTION , with the spa- tial distribution of the different populations being explained by galaxy formation. P opulation I stars are relatively young and metal-rich; they are the younger generation of stars. They are strong- ly concentrated in the plane of our Galaxy and have roughly circular orbits about the galactic centre. They are observed in the disks and spiral arms of other spiral galax- ies. Population I stars are further categorized into extreme and intermediate Population I. Extreme Population I stars are the youngest stars and have an uneven distribution within the spiral arms of spi- ral galaxies. They are stars with the greatest abundance of heavy elements. Extreme Population I includes stars that are in the process of forming, for example TTA URI STARS , stars in young OPEN CLUSTERS , OB ASSOCIATIONS , SUPER - GIANTS and classical CEPHEID VARIABLES . The Sun is an intermediate Population I star, along with many GIANT STARS and stars in older open clusters. P opulation II stars are older, with less abundance of heavy elements. They are further categorized into disk, intermediate and halo Population II stars. The disk Popula- tion II stars are the youngest and form a continuum with the oldest Population I stars. They are concentrated in the b ulge of our Galaxy, with orbital eccentricities and inclina- tions to the galactic plane lying between those of the oldest P opulation I and the halo Population II stars. Short-period RR LYRAE stars are disk Population II stars. Intermediate P opulation II stars are metal poor and are more concentrat- ed towards the galactic plane than the metal-poor halo stars. This group includes HIGH - VELOCITY STARS and MIRA STARS . The oldest, most metal-poor stars are the halo Pop- ulation II stars, which include long-period RR Lyrae stars, stars in GLOBULAR CLUSTERS and W VIRGINIS STARS . The heavy elements within Population II stars are thought to have been produced by a generation of massive and thus short-lived stars, which formed the hypothetical P opulation III. Being massive, Population III stars would have exploded as supernovae, producing the heavy ele- ments observed in Population II stars. They would now exist as NEUTRON STARS and BLACK HOLES . The distribution of populations in our Galaxy has been explained in terms of the collapse of the Galaxy during its formation. The oldest population of stars was made during the infall, which explains why Population II stars are found in the galactic halo and central regions of the Galaxy. These stars, including those in globular clusters, still ‘remember’ their infalling motion and continue to have elliptical orbits around the Galaxy. Stars that formed after the Galaxy had developed its flat rotation plane and spiral arms represent P opulation I, journeying in circular orbits. Between these two extremes lie intermediate populations, showing pro- g ressive flatter and flatter distributions, which represent successive stages in the collapse of the Galaxy. pore Small, short-lived dark area in the photosphere out of which a SUNSPOT may develop. Pores are comparable in size to individual granules, at about 1000 km (600 mi). Porrima The star \u0001 Virginis, visual mag. 2.74, distance 39 l.y. It is a binary, with components each of mag. 3.5 and spectral type F, period 169 years. The two are closest around 2005, when they are difficult to split in amateur telescopes, but move apart thereafter. Porrima is named after a Roman goddess. Porro prism Prism with a cross-section that is a right- angled isosceles triangle. Porro prisms are most commonly encountered in pairs inside each half of a binocular, where they are used to invert the light beam to produce an image the correct way up as seen by the user. The two prisms are placed at right-angles to one another with their long sides in contact, leaving half of each side exposed to allow light in and out. Light enters one prism and after four reflections leaves the other inverted. The distinctive shape of porro-prism binoculars is a result of the arrangement of the prisms.

Porter, together with Albert G. Ingalls (1888–1958), founded the amateur telescope-making movement in America during the 1920s, greatly expanding astronomy as an avocation. He started the Springfield Telescope Makers in 1920, which still holds its annual Stellafane exhibition of amateur-made astronomy instruments – the largest meeting of its kind. Po r ter conceived many ingenious designs, including the turret telescope, which sheltered the observer, and the Springfield mounting, which moves the telescope around a stationary eyepiece. Portia One of the small inner satellites of URANUS , discovered in 1986 by the VOYA GER 2 imaging team. Po r tia is about 108 km (67 mi) in size.

Posidonius Lunar crater (32ºN 30ºE), 96 km (60 mi) in diameter. Posidonius is a complex crater, with central peaks. After its formation, lava intruded beneath the crater, updoming its floor and fracturing it. This action produced rilles in the floor and obscured most of the side-walls. In the western region, flowing lavas produced a SINUOUS RILLE . In the eastern region there is a large slumped wall region, which is nearly semicircular and concentric with the outer rim. position angle (PA) Direction in the sky of one celestial body with respect to another, measured from 0º to 360º eastwards from the north point. For binary star systems, the position of the fainter component, relative to the brighter, is given. Position angle can also indicate the angle at which the axis or some other line of a celestial body is inclined to the HOUR CIRCLE passing through the centre of the body. That angle is also measured eastwards from the north. POSS Abbreviation of P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY SKY SURVEY post-nova Quiescent stage that follows a NOVA eruption. There is a highly characteristic spectrum, visible even decades after the outburst, with hydrogen and helium emission, and various highly excited spectral lines of elements such as helium, carbon and nitrogen. These spectral features are seen in a few objects for which no outburst has been observed and which are assumed to be novae that escaped detection. It is assumed that MASS TRANSFER has yet to be re-established between the secondary and the white dwarf. It is possible that some NOVA - LIKE VARIABLES are post-novae at a slightly later stage of evolution when mass transfer has resumed. potential energy ENERGY stored by a body by virtue of its position, shape or state. Potential energy is stored in a body that is within a gravitational field and is higher than its equilibrium position; the energy is given by mgh , where m is the mass, g the local gravitational acceleration, and h the height above the equilibrium position. Potential energy is also the energy of an electron in an excited state, the energy in a radioactive nucleus before it decays, and, via E = mc 2 , mass. See also KINETIC ENERGY potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA) ASTEROID with an orbit that brings it very close to the orbit of the Earth, making a collision feasible in the near term, the object being large enough to cause significant damage in such an event. The limit set for the minimum orbit intersection distance is generally taken as being 0.05 AU. The minimum size is regarded as being defined by an absolute magnitude H=22, corresponding to an equivalent diameter of between 110 m (360 ft), if the albedo were 0.25, and 240 m (790 ft), if the albedo were 0.05. Sometimes the term ‘potentially hazardous object’ (PHO) is used, mainly because the acronym provides a homophone of ‘foe’. By analogy with the terms NEAR - EARTH ASTEROID and NEAR - EARTH OBJECT , PHOs include COMETS as well as asteroids. Poynting–Robertson effect Non-gravitational force produced by the action of solar radiation on small particles in the Solar System; it causes the particles to spiral inwards towards the Sun. When particles in orbit around the Sun absorb energy from the Sun and re-radiate it, they lose kinetic energy and their orbital radius shrinks slightly. The effect is most marked for particles of a few micrometres in size. A similar effect makes particles in planetary rings and satellite systems slowly spiral inwards. The effect is named after John Poynting (1852–1914) who first described the effect, and Howard Robertson (1903–61), who established the relativistic theory of the effect.

With overall magnitude \u0001 3.1, Praesepe (also known as the Beehive) is readily visible to the naked eye in good conditions. Indeed the 1st century AD Roman writer Pliny described the use of the Praesepe Cluster as a weather-predictor by Mediterranean sailors – as high clouds arrive ahead of bad weather, Praesepe disappears from view. The cluster has an apparent diameter of 95 \u0002 , and contains around 60 stars. It lies at a distance of 525 l.y. and is estimated to be about 700 million years old. preceding ( p ) Term used to describe a celestial body, or feature on a body, that leads another in their apparent motion. Preceding features come into view earlier than the reference feature. For example, in a group of sunspots, the preceding spot is the first to appear as the Sun rotates, while the preceding limb of the Moon is the one facing its direction of travel. Any feature that appears later than a reference feature is said to be FOLLOWING . The term pre- ceding can also be used to describe a star at a lower RIGHT ASCENSION than another. precession Gradual circular motion of the Earth’s axis of rotation which causes the position of the celestial poles to describe a circle over a period of 25,800 years. Discovered by HIPPARCHUS OF NICEA about 150 BC , precession is largely caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon on the Earth’s equatorial bulge. Were the Earth to be a perfect sphere precession would not occur, b ut its spin causes its equatorial radius to exceed its polar radius by about 0.3 per cent. The gravitational pull on the b ulge produces an angular momentum in a perpendicular direction, according to the laws of dynamics. This makes the Earth ‘wobble’ or precess like a spinning top and caus- es the celestial poles to trace a circle of radius equal to the inclination of the Earth’s axis (23º.5). Precession comprises two components: the combined pull of the Sun and the Moon, known as LUNISOLAR PRE - CESSION , is the greater and amounts to 50 \u0003 .40 per year. A smaller component, PLANETARY PRECESSION , caused by the gr a vitational effects of the other planets, amounts to 0 \u0003 .12 per year, but in the opposite direction. The net effect of these, called general precession, is 50 \u0003 .26 per year. Precession causes the FIRST POINT OF ARIES and the FIRST POINT OF LIBRA to drift westwards around the eclip- tic, relative to the background stars, and is therefore some- P Porter, Russell Williams 318 P AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:06 pm Page 318"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"times known as the precession of the equinoxes. They have moved about l h 45 m in RIGHT ASCENSION (RA) since Hipparchus discovered the effect, so that each point has now shifted into the adjoining constellation. Precession is also responsible for making the TROPICAL YEAR , measured with respect to the equinoxes, about 20 minutes shorter than the SIDEREAL YEAR , which is mea- sured with respect to the stars. Another effect is that 13,000 years from now ORION will be a summer constella- tion (in the northern hemisphere). Star positions pub- lished for a particular epoch, such as 2000.0, also have to be corrected for the effects of precession to the date of observation. See also NUTATION prehistoric astronomy See ARCHAEOASTRONOMY pre-main-sequence star Y oung star, still in the process of formation, that has finished accreting material from its parent molecular cloud, but in which nuclear fusion in the core has yet to begin. PROTOSTARS form within the fragmenting molecular clouds. They are very large and cool, lying to the right of the MAIN SEQUENCE on the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIA - GRAM (HR diagram). As they evolve, they contract and their cores start to heat up. With their large size, the change in radius dominates any change in luminosity. They therefore follow almost vertical lines, known as HAYASHI TRACKS , on the HR diagram. At this point, the star’s energy is almost entirely transported by means of convection, and it has only a small radiative core. The star then starts to become radiative, and the lumi- nosity starts to increase as the effective temperature increases. The star’s evolution at this phase is represented by the HENYEY TRACK on the HR diagram. The core tem- perature rises until nuclear fusion can start in its core, at which point it becomes a main-sequence star. The pre- main-sequence phase of the Sun lasted several hundred million years. TTA URI STARS are examples of pre-main- sequence stars. See also STELLAR EVOLUTION pre-nova Putative interacting BINARY STAR system that is in a quiescent state but undergoing active MASS TRANSFER prior to erupting as a NOVA . Technically such a system may be classified as a CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE , and presumably exhibits characteristics similar to those of such a system, most probably appearing as a NOVA - LIKE V ARIABLE . Although images of nova precursors have been detected after the event, no previously known system has y et undergone a nova outburst. The reasons for this undoubtedly lie in the moderately low number of systems known, the relatively short period during which they have been studied, and the extremely long recurrence interval (thousands of years) between nova outbursts. A few pre- outburst light-curves have been obtained, and these appear to show a general rise in the magnitude of the system by some 1–5 magnitudes in the years immediately preceding the outburst. pressure broadening Broadening of spectrum lines as a result of electromagnetic ‘collisions’. Spectrum lines are broadened by mass motions that shift the lines by the Doppler effect, and by the smearing of energy levels by quantum uncertainty, magnetic fields (the ZEEMAN EFFECT ) and electromagnetic effects induced by close- passing atoms. The incidence of electromagnetic collisions depends on the closeness of the atoms and, therefore, on the pressure of the gas. Pressure broadening causes dwarfs to have wider hydrogen lines than do giants and supergiants. primary Largest of a system of celestial bodies. The Sun is the primary member of the Solar System. The term is also used to describe the more massive component in a binary or multiple star system, the primary member of such a sys- tem being the one about which the others rotate. It can also be used to describe a planet with respect to its moons, for example, the primary body of the Moon is the Earth. primary Main, light-collecting mirror in a reflecting telescope. prime focus P osition at which an objective LENS or a primary MIRROR brings starlight directly to a focus (without the intervention of any additional lenses or mirrors). In large research telescopes astronomers use the prime focus of the main mirror to feed light to instruments that need a wide field of view. Some astrophotographers use the term to refer to images formed directly by a SCHMIDT – CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE rather than from the arrangement where an eyepiece is also used to form the image. The term ‘principle focus’ w ould be more correct in this case. Principia Shortened name of Isaac Newton’s Philosophi- ae naturalis principia mathematica (‘Mathematical Princi- ples of Natural Philosophy’), summarizing his researches into physics and astronomy and published in three vol- umes in 1686–87. Most of the work it describes had been completed years before, and it was the persistence of Edmond HALLEY that persuaded the reclusive Newton to put it into print. Its appearance immediately established Newton’s international fame, even though he wrote it (in Latin) in a deliberately abstruse manner ‘to avoid being bated by little smatterers in mathematics’, as he put it. The Principia is a milestone in science, bringing togeth- er systematic observation and rigorous mathematical analysis. Its ‘Newtonian mechanics’ set the agenda for two centuries of enquiry into the physical world. It sets out NEWTON ’ SLAWSOFMOTION and NEWTON ’ SLAWOF GRAV - ITATION , and demonstrates their universality, from earthly motions to the celestial mechanics of the Solar System. It shows that an inverse-square law of gravitation leads inevitably to KEPLER ’ SLAWS governing planetary orbits. The motion of the Moon is analysed in detail, as is the phenomenon of the tides. prism T ransparent optical element with flat, polished sides used to bend or disperse a beam of light. Prisms can have a uniform cross-section, typically triangular as in the PORRO PRISM , or they can have a more complex shape, such as the penta prism used in a single-lens reflex camera.

The porro prism reflects the light through 180º whilst the penta prism reflects it through 90º. Prisms are often used in place of MIRRORS to produce a simple 90º reflection, for example in STAR DIAGONALS . If light enters and/or leaves at any angle other than at r ight-angles to the surface then it will be dispersed into its component SPECTRUM . This dispersion allows the compo- sition of the light to be measured and analysed. Early SPECTROGRAPHS used prisms as their main dispersing ele- ments but modern ones are more likely to use DIFFRAC - TION GRATINGS because these can provide greater dispersion. Prisms are sometimes used in conjunction with ECHELLE GRATINGS to separate the different orders of spectra produced in high-dispersion spectrographs. Large, thin prisms with a very small angle (typically one degree) between the two main sides are used as objective prisms to produce low-resolution spectra of all the objects in a telescope’s field of view simultaneously. Provided the field is not so crowded that the spectra overlap, this tech- nique can be used to survey a large number of objects in a short period of time. It is normally used to identify poten- tial targets for further study at higher RESOLUTION . Procellarum Oceanus (Ocean of Storms) Lunar lava plain in the western region of the Moon. While called an ‘ocean’, it is actually a vast MARE region. However, unlike the majority of maria, which formed within impact basins, Oceanus Procellarum formed in a topographically low region of the Moon. Many volcanic features are found here, including mare (wrinkle) ridges, domes and sinuous rilles. Unusual features include the magnetic Reiner Gamma and the volcanic ARISTARCHUS Plateau. Proclus Lunar crater (16ºN 47ºE), 29 km (18 mi) in diameter, with rim components reaching 2440 m (8000 ft) above its floor. Proclus is intermediate in type between simple bowl-shaped craters and complex craters with central peaks. On its floor are a few small mounds, along with extensive non-terracing slumps. The bright ejecta are irregular because of an oblique impact, which produced a zone without bright ejecta to the south-west. The angle of impact was not low enough, however, to produce an elongated crater. Proctor, Richard Anthony (1837–88) English astronomy writer and popularizer who collated and analysed the work of others, particularly in the areas of Solar System and stellar astronomy. By carefully reviewing drawings of the albedo features of Mars made between 1666 and 1878, he derived a rotation period of 24 h 37 m 22 s .7, very close to the currently accepted value. Proctor studied the distribution of the Milky Way’s stars, inventing graphical techniques to illustrate the arrangement of stars, clusters and nebulae. He charted the 324,000 stars in F.W.A. Argelander’s Bonner Durchmusterung and constructed a map of the Milky Way and its structure. Procyon The star \u0001 Canis Minoris, visual mag. 0.40 (the eighth-brightest in the sky), distance 11.4 l.y., spectral type F5 IV or V. Procyon has a white dwarf companion of mag. 10.7 which orbits it every 41 years, but it is far too close to be seen without a large telescope. The name Pro- cy on comes from the Greek meaning ‘preceding the dog’, from the fact that it rises before Sirius, which is known as the Dog Star.

Its location shifted by about 70 km (44 mi) between its detection on VOYA GER images in 1979 and its appearance on GALILEO images in the late 1990s. The source of the plume cannot therefore be a fixed vent and may instead be the end of a lava flow. Prometheus One of the inner satellites of SATURN , discovered in 1980 by S.A.

Prometheus has a near- circular equatorial orbit at a distance of 139,400 km (86,600 mi) from the planet’s centre, where its orbital period is 0.613 days. It appears to act as a SHEPHERD MOON to the inner rim of the F RING . See also P ANDORA The name Prometheus is also applied to an active v olcano on IO . prominence Relatively cool and dense plasma suspended above the Sun’s PHOTOSPHERE and contained by magnetic fields. The insulating effects of the magnetic fields are such that material in a quiescent prominence may have a temperature of 10,000 K while the surrounding corona is at 2,000,000 K. Prominences appear as bright features extending from the solar limb at a total eclipse or can be seen in a SPECTROGRAM or SPECTROHELIOGRAM of the CHROMOSPHERE taken in the HYDROGEN - ALPHA LINE or H and K lines of ionized calcium. When seen against the bright solar disk, prominences appear as dark filaments. Prominences have been divided into two main classes – quiescent and active. Quiescent prominences occur mainly in two zones in either hemisphere, chiefly away from A CTIVE REGIONS . One zone lies just polewards of the sunspot-forming latitudes (migrating equatorwards behind the sunspots in accordance with SPÖRER ’ SLAW ), while the other forms a high-latitude ‘polar crown’. Qui- escent prominences show no large motions, and can last for weeks or months. Typically, prominences are between 100,000 and 600,000 km (60,000–370,000 mi) in length, 5000 and 10,000 km (3000–6000 mi) wide, and can reach as high as 50,000 km (30,000 mi) above the photosphere. Active prominences are short-lived features showing rapid motion; they are associated with active regions, sunspots and FLARES . They can appear as surges, sprays P Procellarum Oceanus 320 \u0001 prominence This SOHO image from 1997 September 14 shows at lower left a huge eruptive prominence high above the solar limb.

Such eruptive prominence events can arch a million kilometres outwards before bursting apart; their disappearance is often associated with a CORONAL MASS EJECTION . proper motion (symbol \u0001 ) Apparent angular displacement of a star against the celestial sphere as a result of its motion over a year. Proper motion is a combination of a star’s actual motion through space and its motion relative to the Solar System. Stars in our Galaxy move relative to each other and relative to the Sun, but because of their great distances their apparent movements in the sky are very small. In fact most stars are so distant that their proper motions are negligible. The full space motion of a star is the combina- tion of its proper motion, across an observer’s line of sight, and its radial velocity, along the line of sight. The latter is usually measured from the Doppler shift in the star’s spectrum. Proper motion is usually denoted by the Greek letter Mu ( \u0001 ) and is measured in seconds of arc ( \u0002 ) per year. About 300 known stars have proper motions larger than one arcsecond per year, but most proper motions are smaller than 0.1 arcsecond per year. Barnard’s Star in the constellation Ophiuchus has the largest known proper motion, at 10 \u0002 .27 per year. Proper motions are measured by comparing the accu- rate positions of stars obtained at two or more epochs. This gives the components of the proper motion in right ascension, \u0001\u0003 , measured in seconds of time per year, and in declination, \u0001\u0004 , measured in seconds of arc per year. The combined proper motion, \u0001 , measured in seconds of arc per year, is given by: \u0001 = (225 \u0001\u0003 2 cos 2 \u0004\u0005\u0001\u0004 2 ) 1/2 The transverse velocity in space of a star relative to the Sun, V T (km/s), is related to its observed proper motion, \u0001 (arcseconds/year) by: where \u0006 is the parallax of the star. For example, the paral- lax of Barnard’s star is 0 \u0002 .545, so its transverse velocity is 89.3 km/s (55.5 mi/s). Proper motions have traditionally been determined using instruments such as transit circles or from photo- g raphic astrometry, but the astrometric satellite HIPPAR - COS , which operated between 1989 and 1993, measured the proper motions for 118,218 stars with positional accuracies averaging hardly more than a thousandth of an arcsecond. The detailed analysis of many observations are tabulat- ed in a series of FUNDAMENTAL CATALOGUES , the most recent being called FK5 Part II , which contains the posi- tions and proper motions of 3117 FUNDAMENTAL STARS brighter than magnitude 9.5. This catalogue defines the basic reference frame to which the kinematics of all stars in our Galaxy are ultimately referred. Proper motions of stars have been measured with respect to galaxies. The proper motions of galaxies are negligible, so they provide a fixed frame of reference against which to measure stellar proper motions. This method is therefore independent of the positions and proper motions of the bright REFERENCE STARS measured by instruments such as meridian circles. The local motion of the Sun relative to stars within a 20-parsec radius can be derived from proper motions. The average proper motion of the local stars depends on the angle between the direction of the Sun’s motion and the direction to the stars. If the stars lie in the direction of the APEX (or ANTAPEX ) of the Sun’s motion, the average of their proper motions will be zero. The calculated posi- tion of the apex, and the solar velocity towards it, depends to some extent on the number and type of stars used in the analysis. The average result is that relative to the nearby stars the Sun is travelling about 20 km/s (12 mi/s) in the direction of the constellation Hercules. When the solar motion is subtracted from the observed proper motion of a star its peculiar proper motion is obtained. The apparent displacement of a star arising from the solar motion is called its parallactic motion. By measuring the parallactic motion of a homogeneous g roup of stars, the so-called SECULAR PARALLAX of the g roup is obtained. This method has been applied to esti- mate the average distances of groups of variable stars, such as RR LYRAE and CEPHEIDS , which are beyond the range of TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX . Another important application of proper motions is in determining the distances of moving clusters. Since stars in a cluster have a common space motion, their proper motions appear to converge to a point on the celestial sphere. By combining the measurement of the convergent point for the cluster with measurements of its proper motion and radial speed, it is possible to calculate its distance. Proper motion surveys also have an important applica- tion in investigating the distribution and luminosity of stars in the solar neighbourhood. Stars close to the Sun tend to have larger values of proper motion than more dis- tant stars, so by selecting stars from proper motion sur- v eys that are complete to some apparent magnitude, a statistical sample of the stars within a specified volume around the Sun is obtained. By combining this sample with the known parallaxes of some of the stars, and mak- ing allowances for the incompleteness of the sample, one can arrive at a statistical estimate of the distribution and luminosity of the stars in the vicinity of the Sun. This shows that most stars in the solar neighbourhood are intrinsically faint. Proper motions have another important application in the subject of galactic rotation. They provide the only direct method of measuring the Oort constant B , which essentially describes how the rate of change of the angular v elocity of rotation changes with distance from the centre of our Galaxy. proplyd Acronym for PROTOPLANETARY DISK Prospero One of the several small outer satellites of URANUS ; it was discovered in 1999 by Matthew Holman (1967– ) and others.

Proton Russian workhorse satellite and planetary space probe launcher. It started life as a two-stage booster, first flown in 1965, and has since made more than 300 flights in different models. With four stages, the Proton K was first launched in 1967, later proving its capability to place satellites directly into GEOSTATIONARY ORBIT (GEO). A three-stage version of the Proton K has been used to launch SALYUT , MIR and INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION modules. The Proton K is now being marketed as a commercial launcher by a joint US–Russian company, International Launch Services, which also promotes the US Atlas booster. The launcher can place a satellite w eighing 1.8 tonnes directly into GEO or a 4.9-tonne payload into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO).

The planet-forming process begins with small solid bodies, called PLANETESIMALS , in a PROTOPLANETARY DISK orbiting a star. Their mutual gravitational perturbations cause their orbits to intersect, resulting in collisions and growth by A CCRETION . The rate of collisions is enhanced by gr a vitational attraction, which is stronger for more massive bodies, thus the largest planetesimal in some local region of the disk becomes more effective at sweeping up mass than its smaller neighbours, which allows it to become still larger. This process results in rapid ‘runaway gr ow th’ of a large body, called a planetary embryo, which dominates the region of the disk near its orbit and eventually exhausts the supply of planetesimals in that region. This process occurs at various distances from the star, producing hundreds of such bodies, of the order of the Moon’s mass, on separated orbits. Because of their perturbations, these orbits are unstable on somewhat longer timescales, and collisions occur between the embryos. As they become larger in size and fewer in number, the largest may be called protoplanets; the final bodies at the end of this process are planets. In the inner Solar System, formation of embryos took less than a million years, while the late stage of giant impacts lasted for tens of millions of years. The term protoplanet is also applied to self-gravitating condensations hypothesized to form by gravitational insta- bility of the gaseous component of a protoplanetary disk. In some theories, this process is assumed to produce gas g iant planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, after the gaseous protoplanet cools and contracts.

Ptolemaeus Ancient lunar crater which has deeply incised walls that show eroded rims (14ºS 3ºW); it is 148 km (92 mi) in diameter. Its features are the result of impact erosion, much of which came from the ejecta of the IMBRIUM multi-ring impact basin to the north-west. The scars from Imbrium’s ejecta all trend from north- w est to south-east. The floor of Ptolemaeus is smooth, also as a result of the ejecta from the Imbrium impact. The floor contains several ghost craters and a few recent impact scars. Ptolemaic system GEOCENTRIC THEORY of the Uni- ve r se as presented in Ptolemy’s ALMAGEST of AD 140. The Earth is taken to be the centre of the Universe, with the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Sat- urn revolving around it. Outside lies the sphere of the fixed stars. The orbit of a planet as described by EUDOXUS was such that it moves around in a small circle, called the epicycle . The centre of the epicycle itself revolves about the Earth on a larger circle called the deferent . Ptolemy added two further points, the eccentric and the equant , to each orbit. The eccentric is at the centre of a line joining the Earth and the equant; the deferent is centred on the eccentric point rather than on the Earth itself. The centre of the epicycle thus moves around the deferent with a va r iable velocity that makes it appear to be moving with uniform angular velocity when viewed from the equant point – in direct conflict with the Aristotelian doctrine that the celestial motions had to be perfectly uniform. The Ptolemaic system allowed the future positions of the planets to be predicted with reasonable accuracy and remained ‘state of the art’ until ousted by the COPERNI - CAN SYSTEM . Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus) (2nd century AD ) Egyptian astronomer and geographer. His chief astro- nomical work, the Almagest , was largely a compendium of contemporary astronomical knowledge, including a star catalogue, drawing on the work of HIPPARCHUS of Nicaea. It described the so-called PTOLEMAIC SYSTEM , a geocen- tric universe with the Earth fixed at the centre, and the Moon, Sun and planets revolving about it. Ptolemy’s modification of the previous, simpler Greek theory based on epicycles and deferents reproduced the apparent motions of the planets, including retrograde loops, so well that it remained unchallenged until the revival of the HELIOCENTRIC THEORY by Nicholas Copernicus in the 16th century. Little is known about Ptolemy’s life. His dates and even his name are uncertain – ‘Ptolemy’ merely indicates that he had Greek or Greek-naturalized ancestors and lived in Egypt, which was then ruled by the Ptolemaic dynasty. He is sometimes referred to as Claudius, but this probably means simply that Ptolemy’s Roman citizenship goes back to the time of the emperor Claudius I. It seems likely, though, that he lived and worked at the famous library and museum in Alexandria. Ptolemy was a prolific author, but his earliest large wo rk, the Almagest , was not only his greatest, but also the g reatest astronomical work of antiquity. It is essentially a basic textbook, expecting its reader to know only the fun- damentals of Greek geometry and some familiar astro- nomical terms; the rest Ptolemy explains. The first two books form an introduction. They pre- sent an outline of the Ptolemaic system – a spherical uni- ve r se with spheres carrying the planets – and give persuasive arguments that the Earth is stationary at its centre. The basic mathematics, making use of chords (the Greeks did not develop the sines and tangents of modern trigonometry), is described. Book III discusses the apparent motion of the Sun, using observations mostly by Hipparchus, for whose work Ptolemy shows such reverence that of his own observa- tions he seems to have selected only those that agreed with his predecessor’s. A table of the Sun’s motion is then con- structed. The motion of the Moon according to Hip- parchus is the subject of Book IV. The theory, based on eclipses, accounts for the Moon’s motion at conjunction (new moon) and opposition (full moon), but is inade- quate for intermediate positions in the orbit. In Book V, Ptolemy develops his own lunar theory. Based on EPICYCLE and DEFERENT , it is extremely inge- nious. His observations showed him that the Moon changed in apparent size, which he accounts for by a kind of crank mechanism operating on the centre of the Moon’s epicycle. This theory accounts for the motion of the Moon at all positions of its orbit. Book VI explains how to calculate every detail of eclipses. Books VII and VIII present tables of positions and brightnesses of the ‘fixed’ stars, and precession is mentioned. The final books, IX to XIII, are concerned with the thorny problem of planetary motion. There were fewer observations for Ptolemy to use here, and very little past theoretical work to help him. The epicycle and deferent w ere not totally satisfactory in the planetary context, because on their own they could not account for variations in the apparent retrograde motion of a planet, nor could they show why retrograde motion occurred at seemingly irregular intervals. P Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus) 323 \u0001 protoplanetary disk Seen here as a dark oval, about as wide as Pluto’s orbit around the Sun, this protoplanetary disk contrasts with the background glow of the Orion Nebula.

To account for the planets’ occasional retrograde (westwards) motion, an ever more complex pattern of epicycles – small circles superimposed on their orbits – had to be invoked. Eventually, the Ptolemaic system was superseded by the Copernican, which accounted more readily for observed planetary movements.

Using his own observations as well as those of Hipparchus and the Babylonians, he discovered that each planet had two irregularities or ‘anomalies’. One depend- ed on the planet’s elongation, the other on its position along the ecliptic. Ptolemy had to explain these anomalies by a theory that fitted into the framework of the Greek geocentric universe. Careful study showed him that the epicycle and deferent w ould account for the first anomaly. For the second he introduced the ECCENTRIC . Here the centre of the planet’s epicycle moved around a point M whose distance from the Earth was determined by the planet’s apparent eccentricity. It was another basic condition of Greek planetary motion that each planet should move at an unvarying rate about the centre of the Universe (even though observation showed that not one of them did). Ptolemy satisfied this condition by using another point, the EQUANT , on the opposite side of the Earth to M and an equal distance away. Motion with respect to the equant was uniform. This was an inspired solution, which, with an additional minor modification, explained the motions of all the planets then known. The Almagest w as not Ptolemy’s only great text. He wrote the T etrabiblos on astrology, much of it on ‘natural astrology’ – the physical effects of the Sun and Moon, for instance. Then he produced Planetary Tables , which were extracted from the Almagest , and a popular abridgement called Planetary Hypotheses , which, however, extends some of his theoretical ideas and in particular his mea- surements of the distances and sizes of the Sun and Moon. There was also his Phases of the Fixed Stars , which w ent into more detail about rising and setting of the stars just before dawn and just after sunset, and the Analemma , a book on constructing sundials. He also wrote on geogra- phy, music, mechanics, geometry and optics.

The beam of radio waves emitted by the rotating pulsar sweeps past the Earth in a manner similar to the flash of light from a lighthouse beam. The first pulsar was discovered by Anthony HEWISH and Jocelyn BELL in 1967, and there are now over 1000 known. A few pulsars have been detected at wa v elengths other than radio (for example visible light, X- ray and even gamma-ray). The pulsar periods range from milliseconds ( see MILLISECOND PULSAR ) to around 5 seconds, with the most common period being around 1 second. The pulses are not always exactly the same shape from cycle to cycle, or the same strength, and the pulse at each wavelength has a slightly different appearance, but the period is always the same. Some pulsars are found in binary systems ( see BINARY PULSAR ) and there is one case of a pulsar with planets (PSR B1257+12). The distribution of pulsars is concentrated towards the plane of the Galaxy, as is the concentration of supernovae, and there may be as many as 100,000 pulsars in the Galaxy. A pulsar is formed following a supernova explosion, b ut only a few pulsars can be seen in their associated SUPERNOVA REMNANT . Most pulsars are over a million y ears old, so the supernova remnant will have long since dispersed and faded from view. Only something as small as a neutron star can spin fast enough to be a pulsar and not break up. The beams of radio waves come out from both magnetic poles, and the magnetic axis need not be the same as the rotation axis. The beam is a hollow cone, with the gas at the centre in different conditions as com- pared to the edge of the cone. In one pulsar the pulse shape is very complicated, suggesting that the rotating cone is made up of several beams. The first pulsar had a period of 1.337 s and was picked out during a survey at radio wavelengths for objects with signals that changed rapidly on a very short timescale ( see also SCINTAR ). Soon after the first discovery Bell and Hewish found three more pulsars, with periods of 0.253 s, 1.188 s and 1.274 s. The CRAB PULSAR has a very short period (0.033 s); it is at the heart of the Crab Nebula and the obvious result of a supernova. It is one of the few pulsars to be detected at visible wavelengths, and it has also been detected in X-rays and gamma rays. The beams of radio waves are pointing almost directly at Earth, so a weak pulse from the second beam can be seen between the main pulses (called the inter-pulse). The Hubble Space Telescope picture of the Crab Pulsar suggests there may be a JET (with knots of material) coming out from one pole, and waves of gas rip- pling outwards along the equatorial plane. The short peri- od of the Crab Pulsar shows that it is a young pulsar, and it is very gradually slowing down. Almost all pulsars slow down because of the strong magnetic field, the except being the VELA PULSAR , which occasionally speeds up sud- denly (an event called a glitch), producing a faster period. There are around 50 pulsars, known as MILLISECOND PULSARS , with very short periods. Most millisecond pul- sars are thought to have a weak magnetic field, which is why they have not slowed down. For some other millisec- ond pulsars, the short period is explained by proposing that the pulsar was once in a binary star system. The pul- sar slowed down, but then speeded up again when materi- al from the companion was accreted on to the pulsar ( see BINARY PULSAR ). One millisecond pulsar in a binary star system is called the ‘black widow pulsar’ because it is thought to have consumed most of its companion star. The pulses from the black widow pulsar disappear for 50 minutes every 9 hours, when the pulsar is eclipsed by its companion, and the eclipses show that the companion is ve ry small (the mass is 2% of the solar mass although the size is 1.5 times that of the Sun).

In his Theoricae novae planetarum (‘New Theory of the Planets’, 1460), Purbach attempted to explain the structure of the Solar System in terms of both Ptolemy’s epicyclic orbits and the homocentric spheres of EUDOXUS and ARISTOTLE . Purbach Lunar crater (25ºS 2ºW), 120 km (75 mi) in diameter, with rim components reaching 2440 m (8000 ft) above its floor. This ancient crater is from the earliest age of the Moon. Impact erosion has erased its ejecta blanket, rounded its rim, destroyed the north wall, and deeply incised its walls. Several ridges run through the central region of Purbach; these ridges represent the r ims of dilapidated craters, perhaps in combination with central peak remnants. Purcell, Edward Mills (1912–97) American physicist who won the 1952 Nobel Prize for Physics for his role in developing the technology of nuclear magnetic resonance. His major contribution to astronomy was his discovery (1951) of the TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE radio radiation from the spin-flip transition of neutral hydrogen atoms, predicted by Jan OORT . The 21-cm emission from H I regions enabled the structure of the Milky Way and other galaxies to be mapped. Purkinje effect Change in the colour sensitivity of the eye that occurs when D ARK ADAPTATION takes place. The normal level of sensitivity of the human eye lies in the 400–750 nm range, with the peak lying in the yellow to g reen region of the spectrum. As the level of illumination drops, this shifts more towards the green, sensitivity towards the red end of the spectrum decreasing corre- spondingly. The effect, which is named after the Czech physiologist Jan Purkinje (1787–1869), can also influence an observer’s perception of star colours and magnitudes.

It is located on Mount Zijin on the eastern outskirts of Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, at an elevation of 267 m (880 ft). It was b uilt in 1929 and began operation in 1934. Today, the observatory operates several optical telescopes up to 0.6 m (24 in.) in aperture and a 13.7-m (45-ft) millimetre-wave- length radio telescope at its Delinha station in Qinhai Province. The observatory runs research groups in celes- tial mechanics, astrophysics, radio and space astronomy and solar physics.

See also MURAL QUADRANT Quadrantids Major annual METEOR SHOWER , active between January 1 and 6. The sharp maximum, on J anuary 3 or 4, can produce zenithal hourly rates (ZHR) of up to 130 meteors/hr, but activity at other times is usually rather low. The shower is named after its RADIANT in the obsolete constellation of Quadrans Muralis, the stars of which are in what is now identified as northern Boötes. Quadrantid meteors show a number of characteristics typical of a cometary origin, but identification of the stream parent has been rendered nigh-impossible by the stream’s rapid orbital evolution. One possible candidate is the faint short-period (5.24 years) comet 96P/Mach- holz 1. Repeated close passage at aphelion of the stream orbit to Jupiter has led to a considerable spread of its component meteoroids. Computer modelling suggests that the stream was active from a radiant in Aquarius during July until the early centuries AD , before being per- turbed away from encounter with Earth. Chinese and other annals provide evidence for this shower. Having been inactive for over a thousand years, the stream began to be encountered at the descending node of its orbit once more from about 1700 onwards, as the modern Quadrantid shower. Projecting the computer model into the future, the stream orbit is expected to be pulled away from Earth around 2200. The January Quadrantids have been known since about 1835, with a more or less continuous observational record since the 1860s. There is apparent variation in the peak activity, with some remarkably high returns, notably in 1977 and 1992. Although widely spread at aphelion, the meteoroids are encountered by Earth close to their perihelion, where the stream is concentrated and has a narrow cross-section. Consequently, the peak activity is restricted to a comparatively brief period, less than 12 hours. At a given location, perhaps only one return in ten y ears may prove favourable, with the maximum occurring during the pre-dawn hours when the radiant is highest, and in the absence of clouds and moonlight. The Quadrantids show evidence for particle mass- sorting, with faint meteors being proportionally more abundant in the early part of the peak, and bright events (produced by larger meteoroids) peaking later. This is consistent with the smaller meteoroids gradually spi- ralling towards shorter period orbits as a result of the POYNTING – R OBERTSON EFFECT . Dispersal of Quadrantid stream meteoroids is also reflected in the observation that the shower radiant is relatively diffuse, except close to maximum activity. Quadrantid meteors are medium-paced at 41 km/s (25 mi/s). The fainter examples are often described as bluish, whereas the bright Quadrantids sometimes show a pronounced yellow-green colour. quadrature P osition of the Moon or a planet when at r ight angles to the Sun as seen from Earth. At this time, its ELONGATION , the angular distance between it and the Sun, is either 90º or 270º. The Moon is at quadrature when it is at first and last quarter. See also CONJUNCTION quantum theory Theory introduced by Max PLANCK and Albert EINSTEIN at the beginning of the 20th century that showed that light really has a dual nature: it can interact with matter either as a particle (photon), exchanging energy and momentum, or as a wave, producing interference and diffraction phenomena. In 1924 Louis Victor de Broglie (1892–1987) introduced the concept that all forms of matter possess the dual behaviour of particles and waves. The de Broglie wa v elength \u0001 d of a particle is given by \u0001 d p = h , where p is the momentum of the particle and h is the PLANCK CONSTANT . Clinton J. Davisson (1881–1958) and Lester Germer (1896–1971) experimentally confirmed the wa v e/particle duality of particles when they showed that electrons exhibit interference effects. Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) constructed a set of differential equations that describe the wave structure of atomic particles, and the laws that govern their interactions. Later developments in quantum mechanics, principally by P aul Dirac (1902–84) and Werner Heisenberg (1901–76), provided the backbone of the quantum theory of matter. The quantum-mechanical approach pictures the elec- tron as a wave structure that resides in energy levels where the amplitude of the wave is greatest in the vicinity of the classical Bohr electron orbit. In the quantum-mechanical picture, there is a finite probability that the electron can be anywhere in the Universe, but the probability density is highest at the classical orbit or energy level. The quantiza- tion of electron orbits emerges in a very straightforward manner in Schrödinger’s wave formulation: the ‘orbit’ cor- responds to the region where there are an integral number of waves around the atom. This three-dimensional pattern can also be thought of as the probability density of a cloud of negative charge (integrating to the charge on a single electron) around the atom. The nucleus of the atom, being constructed of indi- vidual protons and neutrons, is also described by quan- tum mechanics. Its greater mass results in a more concentrated probability distribution than for an electron. Schrödinger’s equation can be written down for any a tomic system. It will include the effects of the electrosta- tic and magnetic interactions of all the constituent parti- cles. The solution of this equation gives an exact description of the energy states of the system. Only in the simplest of atoms (hydrogen and helium) can accurate solutions – called wave functions or eigenfunctions – of the Schrödinger equation be obtained. F or complex structures (atoms containing many elec- trons, or the atomic lattice structure of crystals) only approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation are, in general, possible. Modern high-speed computers are capable of furnishing solutions of wave equations for quite complex systems. In the area of astrophysics, such solu- tions can give, for example, the energy levels and hence emission-line wavelengths of highly ionized species or complicated molecules not observable in the laboratory. The principal structures of atomic nuclei and the wa ys in which they interact are also governed by quan- tum mechanics. Some of the nuclear reactions of interest in the construction of theoretical models of stars cannot be measured in the laboratory because they occur at too low a rate. For such reactions, calculations of rates must be made, which involve solutions of the wave equations for the two nuclei as they approach, collide and recede from one another. The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics pro- vides an explanation for the ability of particles to ‘tunnel’ from one state to another (of equal energy) without hav- ing to acquire the extra energy to pass over the potential barrier that separates the two states. Such tunnelling, for example, allows nuclear reactions to occur at lower ener- gi es (and hence lower temperatures) than they would otherwise require. On a somewhat grander scale, attempts are currently being made to examine the properties of wave functions that represent the entire Universe, to see if the BIG BANG could be the result of tunnelling from a different state. quantum theory of gravity Theory intended to possess the predictive power of GENERAL RELATIVITY and to exhibit quantum properties.

Continuum theories differ from QU ANTUM THEORY in several ways, the most basic being that there is some smallest size or unit in quantum theories, but not in continuum theories. Physically this means that a region of spacetime can be divided into infinitely small parts and there will never be a ‘smallest’ piece. The mathematical apparatus of each of these types of theories is totally different. Theories of the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces are all quantum theories and they are described by wave functions and probabilities. Gravitational theory, on the other hand, is described by differential equations on a continuous manifold. There are no uncertainties in general relativity and no discrete quan- tum states. Many physicists, including Einstein himself, have endeavoured to find a quantum theory of gravity that w ould retain the predictive power of general relativity, but also exhibit quantum properties. If one were successfully to develop such a theory, one would need to postulate the existence of an exchange particle that mediates the GRAVI - TA TIONAL FORCE . This BOSON , called a GRAVITON , must be mass-less so the force is proportional to 1/ r 2 , and it must have a spin of 2. Individual gravitons have never been directly detected. Every attempt to derive a complete quantum theory of gravity and to put it in a mathematical form similar to the other three FUNDAMENTAL FORCES has failed. Prob- lems arise at very small distances, close to the PLANCK SCALE , where quantized theories of gravity have charac- teristics, described as ‘quantum foam’, that are not com- patible with general relativity. This quantum foam represents fluctuations in the shape and form of the underlying spacetime and would lead to physical effects that are not observed. SUPERSTRING THEORY and other TOEs ( see THEORY OF EVERYTHING ) are attempts to quantize gravity, and to make it compatible with the other three fundamental forces. Although these theories are progressing, they are plagued by a lack of testable predictions since the interac- tion energies involved are well beyond the energies achiev- able in nuclear accelerators. It is quite possible that cosmological observations might be the only way to test string theories of elementary particles. quark Hypothetical subnuclear particles that are believed to be the fundamental building block of HADRONS (baryons and mesons). They have fractional electrical charges ( \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 or \u0002 \u0001 \u0003 , compared with the unit charge carried by a proton or an electron), and have spin v alues of \u0004 \u0003 . There are believed to be six types, or ‘flavours’, of quark, designated ‘up’, ‘down’, ‘strange’, ‘charm’, ‘top’ and ‘bottom’. The up, charmed and top quarks have charges of \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 , while the down, strange and bottom quarks have charges of \u0002 \u0001 \u0003 . Up and down quarks have masses of 0.3 MeV, the others are heavier. Each flavour of quark has an antiquark with opposite properties. Each baryon is thought to consist of a cluster of three quarks (or antiquarks), while mesons consist of quark–antiquark pairs. For example, a proton consists of two up quarks and one down quark ( u+u+d= \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 \u0002 \u0001 \u0003 = net charge of 1), a neutron consists of one up quark and two down quarks (u + d + d = \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 \u0002 \u0001 \u0003 \u0002 \u0001 \u0003 = net charge of zero), and a positive pi meson consists of an up and an anti-down quark ( \u0001 \u0001 \u0002 + \u0001 \u0003 = net charge of 1). Quarks also have a property called ‘colour’, which is analogous to electrical charge and has nothing to do with colour in the conventional sense. There are three differ- ent colours (and three equivalent anti-colours for anti- quarks). Hadrons have zero net colour, and this can be produced either by combining three quarks, each of dif- ferent colour, or by combining two quarks, one with the anti-colour of the other. The requirement for zero net colour explains why baryons are composed of three quarks and mesons of two. The interquark force is known as the colour force, and the interaction between quarks is carried by mass-less par- ticles known as gluons. The strong nuclear interaction between hadrons themselves is believed to be a remnant of the interquark force. The colour force is weak when quarks are close together, but becomes extremely powerful as quarks move apart, preventing quarks from escaping from within hadrons. Almost certainly, therefore, quarks cannot exist outside hadrons as separate free particles. quasar Most luminous category of A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS . The name is formed from the acronym QSRS (for quasistellar radio source) because the initial identification in 1963 was of several examples that had strong radio emission and appeared in the Third Cambridge Catalogue of radio sources. Quasars are characterized by a very luminous core source, with a blue continuum and strong, broad emis- sion lines, strong X-ray emission, and, for quasars prop- er, strong radio emission, either from the core itself or from a double radio source much like that around RADIO GALAXIES . Any surrounding galaxy must be very faint, so that it would not appear on conventional photographs. Quasars generally have redshifts ( z ) greater than 30,000 km/s (20,000 mi/s) out to the largest values yet observed. Most quasars are variable on a variety of timescales, which set limits to the size of the emitting region. These limits are a few light-days or even smaller, which is one of the reasons for the popular model in 327 Q \u0001 quasar This set of quasar images shows the bright nuclear activity that lies at the heart of these galaxies. Each of these quasars is probably fuelled by material falling into a massive central black hole.

The exact origin of the observed radiation remains unclear in this model, partic- ularly where the continuum radiation arises with respect to the accretion disk. Some information is now available on the host galaxies of quasars at moderate redshifts, thanks to data from the Hubble Space Telescope. Radio-quiet quasistellar objects (QSOs) may occur in spiral, elliptical or merging galaxies, while radio-loud objects occur in elliptical galaxies or strongly merging systems. There is a marked excess of galaxies with very close, compact companions, showing that not only can some kinds of interaction trigger the QSO phenomenon, but also that it can happen in episodes not much longer than the lifetime of such an interaction (or a statistical connection would not be seen). Quasars form a continuum in luminosity and spectroscopic proper- ties with type 1 SEYFERT GALAXIES , so that there are some objects that have been treated as belonging to both cate- gories because of their intermediate luminosity. Va r ious arguments have suggested that quasars and radio galaxies are related in a ‘unified scheme’. This holds that most such objects have a core surrounded by a torus of obscuring material which absorbs radiation from infrared to soft X-rays very effectively, so that a quasar viewed near the plane of such a torus would appear as a radio galaxy. The population of quasars has evolved strongly with cosmic time. Going out in redshift from our neighbour- hood, the space density of quasars increases dramatically to redshift z =2.2. Beyond that (at earlier times), the densi- ty declines again, perhaps indicating that the objects actu- ally turned on for the first time at this epoch. Quasars are very important in the study of cosmology and galaxy evolution, not least because they furnish bright and distant background sources that allow detec- tion of cool foreground gas (in and out of galaxies) via absorption lines. Quasars also allow the detection and measurement of foreground masses through GRAVITA - TIONAL LENSING . quasistellar object (QSO) General designation for an object with the optical and X-ray properties of a QU ASAR , b ut without the strong radio emission.

Observations of distant supernovae suggest that the Universe is accelerating. This fact, coupled with the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND results and the fact that there is not enough observed mass to close the Universe, suggests that the cosmological constant in Einstein’s FIELD EQUATIONS is non-zero. The physical manifestation of this repulsive force could come in the form of previously undetected particles called quintessence. Quintessence (or fifth force) would have negative gravity and would cause the Universe to accelerate its expansion. There is no complete theory of quintessence particles and some particle physicists think that if they exist, they must be the size of galactic clusters. quasistellar object 328 Q \u0001 quasistellar object The V ery Large Telescope (VLT) images of HE 1013-2136 show the quasar’s intensely bright nucleus.

In 1944, when Germany began the bombardment of London by V2 rockets, Stanley HEY w as asked to modify an anti-aircraft gun-laying radar in order to give early wa r ning of the approach of a V2. By re-directing the aerial beam to an elevation of 60º radar echoes were obtained from the rockets, but many other short-lived radar echoes were observed that had no connection with the rockets. Hey concluded that these transient echoes w ere associated with the entry of METEORS into the upper a tmosphere. The radar waves are reflected from the long, thin columns of ionization formed at altitudes of about 100 km (60 mi) when a meteoroid evaporates as it plunges into the Earth’s atmosphere. The meteor trails allow the measurement of the wind systems in the 100 km region of the atmosphere. The radar technique allowed meteors to be observed during daylight and through clouds, revealing that major METEOR SHOWERS w ere active in summer daytime. Methods of measuring the velocity of the entry of meteors into the atmosphere w ere developed and a long-standing controversy about the origin of the SPORADIC METEORS w as settled. In 1947 November Frank Kerr (1918–2001) and Charles Shain (d.1960) of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Aus- tralia investigated the erratic changes in the strength of the radar echoes scattered from the Moon. They made use of the Australian Government’s short-wave transmitter, nor- mally used for broadcasting to North America, and were able to distinguish two types of fading of the lunar echoes: a rapid fading with a period of seconds was superimposed on a longer-period fading of about 30 minutes. They sug- gested that the rapid fading was associated with the libra- tion of the Moon and that the long-period fading might have an ionospheric origin. This was confirmed by JODRELL BANK , and it was discovered that the long-period fading was caused by the rotation of the plane of polariza- tion of the radar waves as they passed through the Earth’s IONOSPHERE (Faraday rotation). Further research showed that the radar waves were not reflected uniformly from the whole disk of the Moon, but from a region at the centre of the visible disk that had a radius of only one-third of the lunar radius. Another significant result of lunar radar work has been the systematic measurement of the total electron content between the Earth and the Moon derived from an analysis of the longer-period fading of the lunar echoes. A radar measurement of the distance of Venus settled the ambiguities in the value of the SOLAR PARALLAX (hith- erto known only to 0.1%) and the problem of the rate of rotation of the planet. Success was first achieved by NASA equipment at Goldstone on 1961 March 10 using a con- tinuous-wave system. Pulsed radar contact was achieved at J odrell Bank on April 8, soon followed by other successes in the United States and the Soviet Union. From these dis- tance measurements a definitive value of the solar parallax w as agreed. The spin of the planet affects the spectrum of the scattered radar waves, and in 1962 and 1963 measure- ments in the Soviet Union and the United States first established that the planet was in retrograde rotation with a period of 243 days. In 1962 the Soviet Union achieved radar contact with Mercury, followed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States in 1963 May. In 1963 F ebruary radar contact was established with Mars by both the United States and the Soviet Union. Procedures were developed for radar mapping of the planetary surfaces. In the case of Mercury and Mars, optical imaging from space probes soon provided superior data, but the radar map- ping of the perpetually cloud-covered surface of Venus has been of outstanding importance. Radar maps have been obtained of the planet’s surface with a resolution of a few kilometres using APERTURE SYNTHESIS . In 1979 a comput- er analysis of several months of the data from the radar altimeter carried in the American PIONEER VENUS Orbiter produced a topographical map of more than 90% of the surface of Venus. The Soviet VENERA 15 and 16 spacecraft placed in orbit around Venus in 1983 carried an aperture synthesis radar system that mapped the whole planetary surface above 30º north latitude with a resolution of 1 to 2 km ( c .1 mi). NASA’s MAGELLAN satellite, launched in 1989, mapped 98% of Venus’ surface with a resolution of around 100 m. Other objects in the Solar System detected by radar include a number of asteroids, the four Galilean satellites of Jupiter, and Saturn’s rings.

Radiant positions are normally expressed in terms of right ascension and declination. Meteor showers usually take their name from the constellation in which the radiant lies – the PERSEIDS from Perseus, GEMINIDS from Gemini, and so on. The radiant effect, with meteors appearing anywhere in the sky with divergent paths whose backwards projection meets in a single area, is a result of perspective: in reality, shower members have essentially parallel trajectories in the upper atmosphere. Meteors close to the radiant appear foreshortened, whilst those 90º aw ay have the greatest apparent path lengths. Meteor shower radiants move eastwards relative to the sky background by about one degree each day thanks to Earth’s orbital motion. A meteor shower radiant position may be determined from the backwards projection of plotted or photographed trails. The radiant can also be found from parallactic observations of a single meteor recorded at geographical locations separated by a few tens of kilometres. radiation Energy transmitted in the form of electromagnetic waves or photons, or by subatomic particles. Radiation provides us with almost all the information we have about the Universe. In particular, the study of radiant energy is fundamental to our understanding of stellar structure, because it enables us to deduce the temperatures and luminosities of stars as well as their chemical constitutions. Radiation behaves in two different ways depending upon the interaction with which it may be involved. Dur- ing INTERFERENCE , DIFFRACTION and POLARIZATION it behaves like a wave, while during the photoelectric effect and the COMPTON EFFECT it behaves as though it were formed of a stream of particles. This wave–particle duality is not unique to radiation; entities such as ELECTRONS and PROTONS that are normally regarded as particles also exhibit a wave nature, as for example in the operation of the electron microscope. As a wave, radiation has a wavelength, \u0001 , and a fre- quency, f or v , which are related by the equation \u0001 f = c , where c is the velocity of LIGHT ( see ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM ). As a particle, called a PHOTON , or quantum, each particle has an energy given by E = hf , where h is the PLANCK CONSTANT . Of particular interest to astronomy is the relationship between the temperature of the surface of a hot body and the way that surface emits radiation, which is affected by the nature of the surface itself. It is well known that not all surfaces raised to the same temperature radiate energy in the same way. Some reflect well, but others may be highly absorbing. By KIRCHHOFF ’ SLAW the efficiency of the emission by a heated object at a particular wavelength is proportional to the efficiency of its absorption at the same wa v elength. Thus an object that absorbs with 100% effi- ciency over the whole SPECTRUM , known as a black body, will also be the most efficient when it comes to emitting radiation. The emission from a black body, known as BLACK BODY RADIATION , is a good approximation to the emission from many astronomical objects, including stars ( SPECTRUM lines are mostly minor deviations from the ov erall emission). Black body radiation follows a bell- shaped curve ( see PLANCK DISTRIBUTION ). The peak of the distribution shifts to shorter wavelengths as the tem- perature increases ( see WIEN ’ SLAW ), which leads to the common experience that at moderate temperatures objects glow a dull red, then change colour successively through bright red, yellow, white to blue-white as the tem- perature is increased. The total emitted energy increases rapidly with temperature, leading to the STEFAN – BOLTZ - MANN LAW . At wavelengths significantly longer than that of the peak emission, the simpler Rayleigh–Jeans approxi- mation may often be used, while at wavelengths shorter than the peak, the Wien approximation can be used. The operation of these laws leads to a simple relation- ship between the colour of a star and its surface tempera- ture, T . For example: where (B \u0002 V) is the COLOUR INDEX .

These belts are usually doughnut- shaped regions. The particles trapped in the belts spiral along the magnetic field lines and bounce backwards and forwards between reflection points encountered as they approach the magnetic poles. The electron motion produces SYNCHROTRON RADIATION , a characteristic emission from the individual planetary systems. The particles are captured from the SOLAR WIND or are formed by collisions between COSMIC RAYS and ions in the planet’s outer atmosphere. The Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune are all known to possess radiation belts, while the magnetosphere of Mercury is too small compared to the planetary radius to support this phenomenon. The radiation belts of Jupiter are vast in spatial scale and are additionally supplied by accelerated particles orig- inating from the volcanic moon IO . The resulting particle flux is about 1000 times more intense than in the VA N ALLEN BELTS that surround the Earth. They present a for- midable obstacle for spacecraft, such as GALILEO , since in the region of the most intense radiation the probe would receive an integrated dose of about 200,000 rads from the electrons and 50,000 rads from the protons. This may be compared with a dose of 500 rads, which is sufficient to kill a man. The intense bombardment of a spacecraft can saturate the sensitive instruments, upset the on-board computer systems and interfere with its communications with the Earth ( see also SPACE WEATHER ). The radiation belts of Saturn were discovered by the PIONEER 11 spacecraft in 1979. The extensive system of r ings and the satellites residing inside the magnetosphere of Saturn sweep away the charged particles, such that the fluxes maximize just outside the rings.

The period before this transition is called the radiation era since radiation dominated the thermal evolution of the universe up until that time. After the universe became transparent, matter began to dominate and atoms, stars and galaxies could form. radiation pressure Pressure exerted on a surface by incident ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION . This pressure arises because each incident photon transfers a tiny quantity of momentum to the surface. For BLACK BODY RADIATION , the pressure is given by: where \u0001 is the STEFAN – BOLTZMANN constant, T the temperature and c the velocity of light. One well-known observed effect concerns the dust tails of COMETS , which are affected by the Sun’s radiation pressure and therefore always point more or less away from the Sun, so that when moving outwards, after perihelion, the dust tail of a comet precedes the nucleus. Radiation pressure also limits the maximum mass of a star to about 100 solar masses. At that size, the temperature of the star will be sufficiently high that the radiation pressure pushing outwards balances the inward forces of gravity. Since both gravity and radiation follow INVERSE SQUARE LAWS , once equality is reached at one point within the star, it will be equal throughout the star. Any material moving outwards will therefore continue to do so, and the star will become unstable, shedding material until its temperature is lowered sufficiently for it to become stable again. radiation temperature T emperature of an object found by assuming that its emission at a particular wavelength, or over a small wavelength region, is that of a BLACK BODY . The temperature is obtained using the Planck equation ( see PLANCK DISTRIBUTION ). It is similar to the EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE , except that the effective temperature uses the total emission at all wavelengths from the object and hence the STEFAN – BOLTZMANN LAW . radiative transfer Most important process by which heat energy is transported from a star’s hot interior to its surface. In radiative transfer, high-energy photons lose energy as they travel outwards through the hot plasma. This loss of energy occurs as the photons are scattered, mainly by free electrons. The photons can also lose energy if they are absorbed by an ion, and photo- ionization occurs. These processes take place in the radiative zones of the stars. radioactive age dating Method of determining age by measuring the RADIOACTIVITY of a nuclide with a known half-life. The principle behind radioactive age dating is the fixed rate with which an unstable radioactive isotope (the parent) decays to a stable isotope (its daughter). The time taken for a radionuclide to decay to half its initial abundance is the half-life (T 1/2 ) of the system. Several isotope systems with different half-lives are used to measure different events within Solar System history. Long-lived radionuclides, such as uranium or r ubidium, are used to date the age of formation of meteorites. Short-lived radionuclides, such as plutonium, aluminium or manganese, date the formation interval between stellar processing of material and its incorporation into meteoritic components. radioactivity Spontaneous emission of radiation from an atomic nucleus. An atom of a given chemical element is characterized by the number of protons in its nucleus, which is known as its atomic number. Nuclei of the same element may have different numbers of neutrons and thus different masses; these are called ISOTOPES of the element. Each nucleus with a particular number of protons and neutrons is called a nuclide. The sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons is the atomic weight. Some nuclides are unstable, generally because they contain too few or too many neutrons relative to the number of protons. These nuclides decay spontaneously into more stable nuclides. This process is called radioactivity or radioactive decay. A heavy nucleus with too many protons may emit an alpha particle, consisting of two protons and two neutrons (a helium nucleus). A lighter nucleus may reduce the number of protons by capturing an electron or emitting a positron, thereby converting a proton to a neutron. If there are too many neutrons, one of them may be convert- ed into a proton by emitting an electron (beta particle). Some of these transformations also produce gamma rays, which are highly energetic photons (X-rays). These processes transmute an unstable nucleus of one element into another that is stable; they are known as parent and daughter nuclides respectively. Each kind of unstable nuclide has a characteristic rate of decay. The time taken for half of the atoms of an isotope to decay is called its half-life; various nuclides have half-lives ranging from fractions of a second to billions of years. The decay rate is unaffected by the chemical state of the atoms or by physical factors such as temperature and pressure; this property makes radioactivity an excellent chronometer for measuring ages of geological materials. F or example, three different isotopes of uranium decay to three isotopes of lead with different half-lives, the longest of which is about 4.5 billion years. Precise measurements of abundances of these isotopes in minerals in the most primitive meteorites show that they formed (coincidental- ly) about 4.56 billion years ago, which defines the age of our Solar System. Other useful parent–daughter systems with long decay times include 40 K– 40 Ar (the superscript is the atomic weight of the nuclide), 87 Rb– 87 Sr and three nuclides of Sm–Nd. Shorter-lived nuclides produced by a nearby SUPERNOVA w ere present in the early Solar System. These nuclides are now extinct, but they have left evi- dence in the form of their stable daughter nuclides, which provide relative chronometers. The most important of these is 26 Al, which decays to 26 Mg with half-life 700,000 y ears. An excess 26 Mg in aluminium-bearing minerals indicates that they formed before all of the 26 Al had decayed; the amounts give relative formation times over a span of the first few million years of the Solar System’s history. Other extinct parent–stable daughter pairs include 53 Mn– 53 Cr and 129 I– 129 Xe. Energy released by radioactive decay is an important source of internal heat for planetary bodies, driving con- v ection in Earth’s mantle and core. In the early Solar Sys- tem radioactive nuclides were more abundant, and species that are now extinct were then significant sources of ener- gy. The abundance of 26 Al was sufficient to melt planetes- imals a few hundred kilometres in size, and radioactive heating was the cause of thermal processing of meteorites. radio astronomy Study of a wide range of objects from the coolest, most quiescent astronomical objects (namely the neutral hydrogen gas in the Galaxy) to some of the most energetic (such as PULSARS and QU ASARS ) in the radio region of the spectrum. Every type of astronomical object has been studied at radio wavelengths, including the Sun, planets, stars, nebulae, galaxies and the cosmic microwave background. The radio wavelength region covers the range from around 10 to 20 m (30 to 15 MHz), where the radio wa v es are absorbed and scattered by the ionosphere, and 350 \u0002 m (850 GHz), where atmospheric water vapour absorbs the radiation. The short-wavelength region from 350 \u0002 m to 10 mm is now considered the domain of SUBMILLIMETRE - WA VE ASTRONOMY and MILLIMETRE - WAV E ASTRONOMY , and the region between 1 mm and 30 mm (300 GHz and 1 GHz) is also known as the MICROWAVE P = 4 \u0001 T 4 –––––– 3 c R radio astronomy 331 R AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:15 pm Page 331"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"region. Radio astronomers use frequency as often as wa v elength to characterize the signal because of the historical roots of the area. The initial discovery that radio waves from outside the Solar System were detectable on Earth was made in 1931 by Karl JANSKY , whose name is used for the unit of mea- surement of radio signal. The words ‘radio astronomy’ w ere first used in the late 1940s. The discovery was not thought to be of great significance to the development of astronomy until after World War II, when the new tech- niques that had been developed during the War were used to study these radio emissions and it was appreciated that non-thermal processes must be operating in the Sun and in more distant regions of the Universe. Originally (reflecting the nature of the equipment), radio emission w as measured in decibels since it was ‘signal strength’; now FLUX DENSITY as weak as micro-janskys can be detected. The 250-ft (76.2-m) Mark I RADIO TELESCOPE at JODRELL BANK is an early example of a large steerable telescope; it began work in 1957. The ARECIBO telescope in Puerto Rico (with a diameter of 305 m) is suspended across a sinkhole; it started operations in the early 1960s. However, the power of the radio telescope is seen to best advantage when several radio telescopes are used together, either through APERTURE SYNTHESIS , to improve the detail in maps, or through INTERFEROMETRY , to improve posi- tional accuracy ( see also MULTI - ELEMENT RADIO - LINKED INTERFEROMETER NETWORK ; RADIO INTERFEROMETER ; VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY ). Tw o early discoveries (in the 1950s) confirmed the importance of radio astronomy. One was the development by Soviet physicists of the theory of SYNCHROTRON RADIA - TION in the Milky Way. It was shown that the motion of relativistic electrons in the galactic magnetic field would produce radio emission such that the difficulty in the observed spectrum was removed. The other discovery concerned the nature of the localized (point-like) sources of emission. Although localized sources existed in the Milky Way (particularly SUPERNOVA REMNANTS such as the Crab Nebula), collaboration with the astronomers using the 200-inch (5-m) optical telescope on Palomar led to the surprising conclusion that the majority of the sources were distant extragalactic objects. These became known as RADIO GALAXIES . An important stage was reached in 1960 when, using the 200-inch telescope, Rudolph Minkowski identified one of these radio galaxies with a galaxy having a REDSHIFT of 0.46 – the most distant object then known, assessed to be 4.5 \u0001 10 9 l.y. away, with a recessional velocity of 40% of the speed of light. Radio astronomy is able to detect radio galaxies to much larger distances than can be observed optically. The number of radio sources increases with distance, showing that the Universe is evolving. Another discovery from radio astronomy, by Arno PENZIAS and Robert Wilson in 1965, namely that of the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND , confirmed the theory that the Universe evolves with time. Recent work in this area has been undertaken with the COSMIC BACKGROUND EXPLORER (COBE) satellite, and a new satellite ( PLANCK ) will continue the study is greater detail. Y et another important discovery by radio astronomers w as that of pulsars, by the group at Cambridge (includ- ing Anthony HEWISH and Jocelyn BELL ) in 1967. The ini- tial discovery was of a source emitting a pulse of radio wa v es every 1.337 seconds with a precision better than one part in 10 7 . Over 700 pulsars have been discovered, and although there are very few optical identifications it is widely accepted that they are rapidly rotating NEUTRON STARS – the collapsed very high-density remnants of stars that have undergone a SUPERNOVA explosion. The beam of radio emission, from the pole of the neutron star, s wings rapidly across our line of sight, like the beam of light from a lighthouse. Pulsars have been detected with millisecond periods, in binary systems, and even with planets orbiting around them. The final stage of stellar evolution following the supernova explosion is the cre- a tion of a supernova remnant, which can be observed at radio wavelengths as the material from the supernova interacts with the interstellar medium. Neutral hydrogen was known to be the principal com- ponent of the Galaxy; Hendrik van de HULST predicted that it should be possible to observe a spectral line from it in 1945. The line at 21 cm ( TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE LINE ) was detected in 1951. The motion of the neutral h ydrogen gas can be studied using the 21-cm line, which gave the first unambiguous determination of the spiral structure of the Galaxy. Many other galaxies are close enough to be resolved and mapped in the radio part of the spectrum, and it has been found that the neutral gas extends farther from the galaxy centres than the visible light and stars indicate. The motions of the neutral h ydrogen gas can be used to track the distribution of the mass in the Galaxy, showing that in most normal galaxies only about 10% of the mass of the galaxy is observed (the rest is D ARK MATTER ). Several important molecules are observed in the radio region: OH (the hydroxyl radical) at 18 cm was the first, in 1963. Over 100 molecules have been detected from inter- stellar space in the Galaxy, from other galaxies, and from the envelopes around late-type stars in the Galaxy. The emission from molecules can be enhanced by the MASER process, and the masers in the outer envelopes of late-type stars can be accurately tracked showing the motions, and expansion, of the stellar envelope. These changes can be seen on short time-scales (months and years). Until mole- cular hydrogen could be directly detected, CO (carbon monoxide) was a very important molecule because it was co-located with molecular hydrogen in cold clouds and could be used to trace it. See also INTERSTELLAR MATTER radio galaxy Galaxy that emits in the radio region of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM at rates around a million times stronger than the Milky Way. Many radio galaxies have optical counterparts, which are almost invariably ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES . The emission from a typical radio galaxy is concentrated in two huge radio LOBES lying well outside the galaxy and frequently located symmetrically about it. In appearance these lobes look as though they have been explosively ejected from the central galaxy. The lobe sizes for the biggest radio galaxies are around 16 million l.y., comparable with the size of a typical cluster of galaxies (our own Galaxy is around 65,000 l.y. across). These giant galaxies are the largest known objects in the Universe. CYGNUS A w as the first radio galaxy to be detected, the strongest source of radio emission outside the Galaxy. The lobes are only around 3 million years old, compared to perhaps 10 billion years old for the stars in the central galaxy. Both Cygnus A and CENTAURUS A are thought to be galaxies in collision. In Centaurus A the small spiral galaxy, engulfed by the giant elliptical galaxy, can be seen in the INFRARED , and the optical image shows a large dark dust lane across the galaxy. Centaurus A is also an X-ray source. The optical galaxy M87 coincides with the radio R radio galaxy 332 \u0001 radio galaxy Jets emerging from the active nucleus of Cygnus A produce two lobes of strong radio emission to either side of the galaxy, as seen in this image from the V ery Large Array. Many radio galaxies show similar patterns of emission as material they eject impacts on the surrounding intergalactic medium.

A JET of gas 8000 l.y. long can be seen, and the light is polarized, showing that the synchrotron mechanism is at work, and there is a strong magnetic field present. The positions of the radio galaxies must be determined with very high precision, using VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY . This enables telescopes to image the faint optical counterparts. The structure of the galaxies, the lobes and jets can be mapped using APERTURE SYN - THESIS , so that details can be investigated using telescopes such as the VERY LARGE ARRAY . Radio astronomers have found that the extended radio lobes are almost invariably connected to the central galaxy by jets, which seem to originate from the galactic nucleus. High-frequency VLBI observations have revealed strong, point-like, active radio sources in the nuclei of many objects. It seems clear that the basic ‘engine’ that drives the explosion lies in the galaxy’s nucleus, although it is unclear what the engine might be. Whilst the collision of two galaxies may con- tribute to the engine, INTERACTING GALAXIES are usually w eak radio sources. Radio galaxies may have more in common with QU ASARS and BL LACERTAE OBJECTS , which are as powerful radio emitters as radio galaxies (or slightly more powerful). Radio galaxies have more emission at lower frequencies: in the famous THIRD CAMBRIDGE CATA - LOGUE (3C) about 70% of sources are found to be radio galaxies, but in surveys made at higher frequency, such as the Parkes 2700 MHz survey, less than 50% are believed to be radio galaxies. Radio galaxies may be old quasars or failed quasars. There is still much to learn. radio interferometer Tw o (or more) RADIO TELESCOPES separated by a distance greater than (or comparable to) their diameters that are looking at the same astronomical object; their signals are combined electronically. Radio interferometers were developed in order to permit radio telescopes to attain much higher resolution than was possible with a single telescope (usually more than 60 \u0001 ). Radio telescopes are used as interferometers to get more accurate positions for radio sources, allowing telescopes at other wavelengths (most commonly optical telescopes) to identify the source of the radio emission, and to map sources in greater detail to identify the places of most intense radio emission. When the two signals from the two separate telescopes are combined correctly ( see INTENSITY INTERFEROMETER ) they will either reinforce or cancel each other, depending on the amount of delay between the two signals. If the two telescopes of the interferometer are arranged along an east–west line on the Earth, a radio source moving across the sky will produce a series of maxima and minima as the delays between the signals received by the two telescopes change. It can be difficult to decide whether the delay is zero or a whole number of wavelengths, but the ambigui- ties can often be removed by observing with the radio tele- scopes at different separations from each other (changing the amount of the delay). For this reason many radio interferometer telescopes are mounted on railway tracks, which permit the spacings to be changed easily. LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY and VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY do not use physical connec- tions; instead the signals from each telescope are record- ed on high-quality video tape recorders, with very accurate time signals (from atomic clocks or masers) recorded on a time-track along with the sky signals. The separate tape recorders have to be synchronized at play- back to a very high accuracy. In a normal radio interferometer with two telescopes, the voltage levels from the signals received at each tele- scope are not added together but multiplied. In this case the power output of the combined signal is proportional to the product of the individual voltages and the individ- ual telescope dish diameters, so a small dish can be very effective as an interferometer when working with a sec- ond larger dish of large collecting area. Interferometers can reach resolving powers of better than a thousandth of an arcsecond. The first radio interferometers were built in the early 1950s and were used to measure the sizes and positions of the strong sources then known. Objects such as the pecu- liar galaxy CYGNUS A w ere shown to be emitting vast quantities of radio energy from small regions. The identi- fication of the strong radio source Taurus A with the CRAB NEBULA supernova remnant was only possible after an accurate position had been measured with the Dover Heights Sea Interferometer near Sydney, Australia. This instrument used only one aerial perched on the top of a cliff overlooking the sea; the second aerial was formed by the reflection of the first in the water. radio scintillation Irregular rapid changes in the apparent intensity of radio sources, caused by variations in the electron density in the IONOSPHERE (mainly the F2 layer) and in the interplanetary gas. It occurs only with sources of less than 1 \u0001 diameter. See also SCINTAR radio telescope Instrument used to collect and measure ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION emitted by astronomical bodies in the radio region of the spectrum. The radio region extends from around 10 mm to around 10–20 m. The short-wavelength region from 10 mm to 350 \u0002 m is now defined as the MILLIMETER - WA VE ASTRONOMY and SUBMILLIMETRE - WA VE ASTRONOMY range, but much of the equipment and many of the techniques are the same as those in the radio region. Almost all the types of object studied with optical telescopes have also been observed with radio telescopes. These include the Sun, planets, stars, gaseous nebulae and galaxies. Furthermore, RADIO ASTRONOMY has been responsible for the discovery of several new and unsuspected types of astronomical phenomena, such as QU ASARS , PULSARS and the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND . The first radio telescope was built by Karl JANSKY in the early 1930s, and he recognized that the ‘noise’ he was detecting came from the Milky Way. Following World War II, there was a glut of cheap (or free) radar and communi- cations equipment. Using this equipment, experimental telescopes were built, mainly in Australia and England, b ut there was interest in many countries including USA, Soviet Union, France and Japan. Since radio wavelengths are large, the paraboloid receiving dish does not have to be solid (as in an optical telescope): if the radio telescope is operating at wavelengths longer than around 20 cm, it can use mesh instead. There are several types of radio tele- scope in addition to the standard steerable telescope. Occasionally, radio dishes have been built on EQUATORIAL MOUNTINGS , similar to those used for most optical tele- scopes, but these have not proved popular. Radio tele- scopes are normally built with ALTAZIMUTH MOUNTINGS . That is, their basic movements are up-down and around parallel to the horizon. The alt–az mount, as it is known, R radio telescope 333 \u0001 radio telescope Just like an optical reflector, a radio telescope depends on collection of electromagnetic radiation by a large aperture, parabolic reflector, often in the form of a dish.

In fact, many new optical telescopes are being built with alt–az mounts. The largest steerable telescopes are the 100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope (near Bonn) and the 100-m Green Bank Telescope (in Virginia), followed closely by one of the oldest, the 250-ft (76.2-m) JODRELL BANK tele- scope. The third largest steerable telescope is the 64-m (210-ft) P ARKES RADIO TELESCOPE in Australia. The 300-m (1000-ft) telescope in ARECIBO , Puerto Rico, is suspended over a sinkhole and does not move, although tracking capability is provided by the secondary mirror. Even with these very large telescopes the resolving power is poor by optical standards (perhaps around 60 \u0001 –100 \u0001 at typical wavelengths); the problem has been overcome by combining several radio telescopes using APERTURE SYN - THESIS to mimic a bigger telescope (up to the size of the Earth). Another approach is to use two (or more) tele- scopes as a RADIO INTERFEROMETER to improve the reso- lution. VERY LONG BASELINE INTERFEROMETRY using a few telescopes, very widely separated, can produce a resolving power of a few thousandths of an arcsecond. A single radio telescope does not produce a picture directly (unlike an optical telescope); the dish must be scanned forwards and backwards to build it up, and the data then fed through a computer. The computer is also vital for controlling the telescope (which may weigh 1000 tonnes), pointing it accurately at the required position in the sky, moving continually in two coordinates (altitude and azimuth), and correcting for the inevitable deformation of a large dish. The accuracy required is often better than 10 \u0001 , which becomes millimetres when translated into dish move- ments. Most radio telescopes are not located inside build- ings, so the computers have to correct for weather too, such as high winds, cold and heat. Radio telescopes can also be adversely influenced by ice, rain and lightning. radio waves ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION with wa v elengths ranging from millimetres to hundreds of kilometres. Radio waves were first generated artificially by Heinrich Hertz (1857–94) in 1888. Radio astronomers measure radio waves in frequency units (cycles per second, called hertz, symbol Hz) as often as in wa v elength units, for example the TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE LINE of neutral hydrogen and the four lines of OH at 1612, 1665, 1667 and 1720 MHz. To convert from one to the other is quite straightforward: frequency \u0002 wa v elength = velocity of light ( f \u0003 = c ). radio window Range of wavelengths, from around a few millimetres to about 20 m, to which the terrestrial a tmosphere is transparent. The window has several subdivisions, which have become separate areas of astronomy because of the techniques used for observing them: the submillimetre, the millimetre and the microwave. At short wavelengths, the radio waves are absorbed by water vapour in Earth’s atmosphere, and at long wavelengths the radio waves are absorbed and scattered by the IONOSPHERE .

Of the nine probes launched in 1961–65, only the last three were successful. The first success came with Ranger 7 in 1964 July, when 4316 television images of the surface at ever- increasing resolutions were returned before the spacecraft hit the region now known as Mare Cognitum. A MARE area was selected because of its relatively level and uncratered surface, two essential criteria for the future APOLLO PROGRAMME manned landings. The final wide-angle frame covered an area about 1.6 km (1 mi) square, showing craters down to about 9m (30 ft) in diameter. The best-resolution images showed craters as small as 1 m (3 ft) in an area about 30 by 49 m (100 by 160 ft). Ranger 8 was targeted to a point in southwest Mare T ranquillitatis, while Ranger 9 headed for a more scientif- ic target, the crater Alphonsus. The images showed that the lunar mare areas were free from small, deep craters and widespread rock fields, and that they would support the weight of a spacecraft. The Rangers also provided accurate values of the Moon’s radius and mass ratio with respect to the Earth.

Rays are prominent on the Moon and Mercury; they are also seen on some satellites of the outer planets. Rays are believed to be surface deposits of finely comminuted EJECTA excavated from craters. Rays diverge from well-formed, young craters for typical distances of 10 diameters. They traverse relief without deviation or interruption, indicating ballistic emplacement. Most rays are brighter than the underlying surface, probably due to light scattering from small grains. Rays often contain small secondary craters, which are caused by the impact of large chunks of excavated material. It is not known why this material tends to go in specific directions rather than being uniformly distributed.

R Coronae Borealis stars are high-luminosity stars of spectral types Bpe–R, carbon- and helium-rich but hydrogen deficient. The fades may be anywhere between 1 and 9 magnitudes; the resultant deep minima may last for a few weeks, months or for more than a year. These fades occur completely at random, without the least sign of any periodicity, and once a decline has commenced it is usually rapid, especially if the fading is of several magnitudes. The subsequent rise back to maximum is ve ry much slower, and there are many fluctuations in brightness as the star rises. R Coronae Borealis stars spend most of their time at maximum, some then pulsating about 0.5 magnitude in a semi-periodic manner. Several show periods of around 35 to 50 days for these slow pulsations. R Coronae Borealis stars are a small class of SUPER - GIANTS , numbering about three dozen. The type star, R Coronae Borealis, was first found to be a variable in 1795. It is normally about 6th magnitude, and may remain at this maximum brightness for as long as ten years before suddenly beginning to fade. The minimum may be any- where between 7th and 15th magnitude: there is no way of determining just how much it will fade. It remains at min- imum for a few weeks or several years: again, there is no wa y of knowing for how long. Other stars in this group behave in a similar manner, although they are not as bright at maximum as R Coronae Borealis. RY Sagittarii when at maximum is about half a magnitude fainter than R Coronae Borealis, and the remaining members of the g roup are very much fainter. In those stars for which adequate spectra are available, chemical abundances are estimated at 67% carbon, 27% h ydrogen and 6% light metals.The greatest attention spec- troscopically has been given to the two brightest examples, R Coronae Borealis and RY Sagittarii. Investigators agree that both stars are much more abundant in carbon than h ydrogen and also that lithium is overabundant in both, with the C 2 absorption bands only weakly present. Other RCB stars have strong C 2 absorption bands and are pre- sumably cooler. During the initial decline the normal ABSORPTION spec- trum is rapidly replaced by a rich EMISSION SPECTRUM . All RCB variables have an infrared excess. Variations in the infrared do not occur at the same time as changes in the visual, and changes in either may be unrelated to changes in the other. A number of models have been proposed to account for the behaviour of RCB variables. In one, a gas cloud forms above the photosphere and moves outwards. As it does so it cools and condenses, forming small particles of g raphite. These are very efficient absorbers of light and so w ould account for the sudden declines in brightness. The cloud would disperse, becoming at first patchy and trans- parent in places. Later, the temperature and pressure w ould become so low that the carbon particles would con- dense into soot, revealing the star once more. Alternatively, particles form in the upper photos- phere, cutting off the chromosphere from its source of excitation so that it gradually decays. A third theory sug- gests that a cloud is ejected from the star. The chromos- pheric spectrum then results from an eclipse by the dense cloud in the observer’s line of sight. This spectrum is in many ways similar to that of the solar chromosphere during a total eclipse of the Sun. At first the cloud might be much smaller than the star, but as it moved away it w ould grow in size and, if it were centred over the star, cause an eclipse that would result in the deep declines that are observed. The RCB variables provide a very good example of why professional astronomers welcome the assistance of amateurs. The professionals are interested in certain parts of the light-curves of these stars, especially the com- mencement of deep declines. The cost of modern instru- ments and the demands on them mean that they cannot be used night after night, often over periods of years, in the hope that a decline of an RCB star will be observed. Professionals therefore rely on amateurs to monitor these stars continuously and to advise them whenever a fade is detected. In this way the amateurs also produce the data needed to determine how RCB stars pulsate at maxima and the period in which they do so. Reber, Grote (1911– ) American pioneer of radio astronomy. In 1932, while working as a designer of radio sets, he heard of Karl JANSKY ’s discovery of cosmic radio emission and set about designing and building equipment to investigate the phenomenon for himself. Six years later, he completed a 9.57-m (31.4-ft) paraboloidal dish erected behind his house, and the ancillary instrumentation.

From then until after World War II, when Stanley HEY and others began to follow up their wartime research, Reber was the world’s only radio astronomer. He detected radio emission from many sources (then called ‘radio stars’) that did not correspond to visible stars, such as CASSIOPEIA A and CYGNUS A . He also found that the Sun and the Andromeda Galaxy emitted at radio wavelengths. In 1948, with the potential of radio astronomy rapidly coming to be appreciated, he tried unsuccessfully to raise funds for a 67-m (220-ft) US radio telescope; instead the w orld’s first large dish was constructed at JODRELL BANK , UK, under the direction of Bernard LOVELL . Reber con- tinued to map the radio sky, particularly at 1–2 MHz (150–300 m) with modest equipment of his own con- struction, moving to Tasmania in 1954. r eciprocity failure In astrophotography, pronounced diminution in the effective sensitivity or speed of a photo- g raphic emulsion with longer than optimum exposures. In bright conditions, image brightness is inversely pro- portional to exposure time (hence reciprocity ). Thus, doubling the exposure time exactly compensates for a halving of image brightness. But the reciprocity fails with the very low image brightnesses encountered in astropho- tography, and much longer exposures are necessary. One wa y of countering this effect is to subject the film to HYPERSENSITIZATION . r ecombination Capture of an electron by a positive ion. In a PLANETARY NEBULA or DIFFUSE NEBULA , hydrogen a toms (as well as other atoms and ions) are ionized (or further ionized) by ultraviolet radiation from hot stars. Protons and heavier ions then capture the free electrons, which takes the ions to their next lower ionization states (hydrogen becoming neutral). Recombination to an atom or ion can take place on any energy level. As electrons move from the levels on to which they are captured to lower levels, they radiate EMISSION LINES . Recta Rupes (Straight Wall) Lunar fault running from 20ºS 8ºW to 23ºS 9ºW. This fault is radial to the Mare IMBRIUM ; it was probably formed by the shock wave from that impact and then covered by its EJECTA . Later, basalts flooded the region, placing stress on the fracture until it activated as a fault. The fault has a slope angle of approximately 40º, though in telescopes it appears much steeper. The mare ridges surrounding Recta Rupes are from the submerged walls of an ancient crater ( see GHOST CRATER ). r ecurrent nova (NR) BINARY STAR system in which the secondary is a late type (G, K or M) giant filling its R OCHE LOBE and transferring material to a less massive WHITE DWARF primary. At intervals of years to tens of y ears this accreted material on the surface of the white dwarf explodes in a thermonuclear reaction, causing the brightness of the star to increase by 7 to 10 magnitudes for about 100 days in the visible and for double that at other wavelengths. These stars are brighter at minimum than an ordinary NOVA , but not because of the cycle length; the stars with longer cycles tend to show faster development and brighter maximum luminosity. Recurrent novae may be regarded as ordinary novae that have had more than one outburst (of lesser amplitude than normal novae) or as DW ARF NOVAE with very long intervals between outbursts. Typical recurrent novae are: T Coronae Borealis, which had outbursts in 1866 and 1946 (with two smaller outbursts in 1963 and 1975); RS Ophiuchi, with outbursts in 1898, 1933, 1958 and 1985; and T Pyxidis, which flared up in 1890, 1902, 1920, 1944 and 1966. At present only six confirmed recurrent novae are known, with a few additional suspected systems. Apart from RS Ophiuchi and T Pyxidis, which closely resemble one another, the systems show considerable variations in their characteristics. r eddening Phenomenon exhibited by radiation as it passes through the interstellar medium and is absorbed by gas or dust and re-radiated. Most of this re-radiation is at a longer wavelength than the original incident radiation. As such, visible light is re-radiated at a ‘redder’ wa v elength than it originally had. Generically, radiation is described as reddening as it travels, and this description is even applied in the infrared. r ed dwarf Star at the lower (cool) end of the MAIN SEQUENCE with spectral type K or M. Red dwarfs’ surface temperatures are between 2500 and 5000 K and their masses are in the range 0.08 to 0.8 times that of the Sun. Red dwarfs are the most common type of star in our Galaxy, comprising at least 80% of the stellar population. Examples are BARNARD ’ SSTAR and PROXIMA CENTAURI . Red dwarfs have a similar composition to the Sun, with a thick outer convection zone compared to the radius of the star. They exhibit many solar-type phe- nomena, such as spots, a chromosphere, a corona and flares. The rotation rate of many red dwarfs has been determined from fluctuations in their light-curves due to the presence of large, cool starspots analogous to SUNSPOTS . The slower the rotation, the less active the star. Red dwarfs with rotation rates above about 3 to 5 km/s (2–3 mi/s) often show flare activity and are known as FLARE STARS . All red dwarfs close enough to be studied in detail show a spectrum consistent with the existence of a chro- mosphere. X-ray emission suggests the existence of coro- nae; the more active the red dwarf, the higher the X-ray emission, suggesting hotter coronae. See also DW ARF STAR r ed giant Star that has finished burning hydrogen in its core and that is experiencing hydrogen shell burning. As a consequence, its atmosphere expands and its effective temperature falls to between 2000 and 4000 K, making it appear red in colour. Red giants have SPECTRAL TYPE K or M and lie in the upper right hand part of the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM . They have diameters 10 to 1000 times that of the Sun. ARCTURUS and ALDEBARAN are red giants. Red giants are often V ARIABLE STARS , with slowly pul- sating surface layers. Because of the red giants’ large radii, the gravitational effect falls considerably at their outer lay- ers; they often lose substantial amounts of material from STELLAR WINDS , producing a PLANETARY NEBULA . The Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS) discovered many red giant stars embedded within extensive dust shells, which, radiating at a temperature of a few hundred Kelvin, are detectable only in the infrared. Red Planet Common name for the planet MARS , owing to its striking red colour. r edshift ( z ) Lengthening of the wavelengths of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION caused by the expansion of the Universe and curved SPACETIME . Wavelength shifts are commonly ascribed to the DOPPLER EFFECT , first described by Christiaan Doppler (1803–53) in 1842. Though the ‘redshifts’ that pertain to the Universe are not caused by the Doppler effect, it must be examined first. The Doppler effect is encountered in all manner of wa ve motion, from water waves through sound waves to light. Its most familiar aspect is the drop in the pitch of sound from a passing automobile or aircraft. As a body approaches, the waves seem to be shifted to shorter wa ve lengths; if the body is receding, the wavelengths appear longer. The Doppler shift is readily detected in astronomical bodies by the shifts in the wavelengths of spectrum lines. An approaching body has its spectrum lines shifted towards longer wavelengths, in the vernacu- lar of astronomy ‘towards the blue’ (a ‘blue shift’, no matter what the lines’ actual colours). The lines of a receding object are shifted towards longer wavelengths, similarly ‘towards the red’ (a ‘red shift’). The greater the R r eciprocity failure 336 R AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:15 pm Page 336"},{"pageNumber":346,"pageContent":"speed along the line of sight (the RADIAL VELOCITY ), the g reater the wavelength shift. Under ordinary low-veloci- ty circumstances (such that relativity is not required), the relative shift (change in wavelength divided by wave- length) equals the radial velocity ( v ) divided by the speed of light ( c ), or ( \u0001 observed \u0002\u0001 0 )/ \u0001 0 = v / c where \u0001 observed and \u0001 0 are respectively the observed and rest (laboratory) wavelengths. Half the stars show blue shifts in their spectra, the other half red shifts. The single-word term ‘redshift’, however, is reserved for galaxies. The ‘redshift’ ( z ) is simply the observed relative wavelength change: z = ( \u0001 observed \u0002\u0001 0 )/ \u0001 0 which in Doppler notation is v / c , or v = zc , which works as long as the velocities and distances are – by the standards of cosmology – small. In 1914 Vesto M. SLIPHER , at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona, began studying the spectra of objects then called ‘spiral nebulae’, but today known to be galaxies. He found that 11 of the 15 he examined displayed redshifts, thereby indicating a strong preference for recessional motion. Years later, Edwin HUBBLE at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California proved these objects to be (by present standards) relatively nearby galaxies, each rather like our own Galaxy. By 1929 Hubble had succeeded in proving that the redshift of a galaxy is directly proportion- al to its distance from Earth. This discovery, today called the HUBBLE LAW , can be written as v = H 0 d = zc , where d is the distance to a galaxy and H 0 is a term of proportion- ality called the HUBBLE CONSTANT . The value of H 0 , which has been hotly contended, is currently set at around 70 km/s/Mpc; that is, the recession velocity of a galaxy increases by 70 km/s for every megaparsec away from the Earth. The Hubble law tells us that the Universe is expanding – its galaxies (really the clusters of galaxies) are getting farther apart. If megaparsecs and kilometres are scaled to each other, H 0 has units of inverse seconds. The inverse of H 0 there- fore has units of seconds, and thus gives an age for the Universe (discounting gravitational drag or Einstein’s accelerative cosmological force) of around 13 billion y ears. The Hubble law is also reversed to find distances to remote galaxies simply by measuring their redshifts. If v = zc = H 0 d , then d = zc / H 0 . ‘Redshift distances’ are being used to map great portions of the Universe. Redshifts of the most distant galaxies are so great that they can be determined through colour alone. At maxi- mum, z exceeds 5. The simple Doppler formula would suggest that such bodies are moving away at over five times the speed of light, which is impossible. The expan- sion of the Universe is properly described by the theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY , formulated by Albert EINSTEIN . According to this description, space expands with time. Galaxies are not moving through space, but are riding along with space as it grows larger. Redshifts of galaxies caused by the expansion of space are therefore not the result of the Doppler effect. When a galaxy radiates ener- gy, its photons become trapped in the web of space along with everything else. As the photons approach us, space expands, and therefore the photons stretch and their wa v elengths lengthen and shift to the red. The farther aw ay the galaxy, the longer the flight time and the greater the stretch. Distant galaxies therefore have greater red- shifts than nearby ones. Superimposed on those redshifts related to the expansion of the Universe are genuine Doppler shifts caused by the local motions of galaxies through space. Such Doppler effects can mask the effects of expansion and have historically made the determination of H 0 quite difficult. The Doppler formula ( v = zc ) gives velocities when the redshifts are low, much less than 1. But when the redshift z approaches 1, zc no longer equals v , and a correct for- mula, given by the theory of general relativity, must be used. Unfortunately, there is no unique simple formula, because the relation depends on the structure of the Uni- ve r se. Indeed, we can use redshift and distance measure- ments to learn about the structure of the Universe. The redshift of a given body tells us how much the Universe has expanded since the light left that body. The fractional change in wavelength during the flight time of a photon is \u0001 observed / \u0001 emitted , where \u0001 emitted is the ‘rest’ wave- length \u0001 0 . This ratio equals the fractional degree to which the Universe has expanded, given by R observed / R emitted , where R emitted is the distance between two galaxies at the time of photon emission and R observed is the distance at the time it was received. The redshift z is therefore ( \u0001 observed \u0002\u0001 0 )/ \u0001 0 = \u0001 observed / \u0001 0 \u0002 1= R observed / R emitted \u0002 1 Thus R observed / R emitted , which could be thought of as a local ‘radius’ of the Universe, equals z + 1. That is, if the red- shift z for a given galaxy is 0.5, the Universe has expanded by a factor of 1.5 since the light departed the galaxy on its way to us. The most highly redshifted photons are those in the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND radiation. These pho- tons have been travelling towards us since matter and radi- a tion decoupled from each other (that is, when the Universe went from being opaque to transparent) about 300,000 years after the Big Bang. They exhibit a redshift of z = 1000, meaning that their wavelengths have been stretched a thousand-fold during their 13-billion-year journey to Earth. r edshift survey Method of mapping the three- dimensional distribution of galaxies in space, with the aim of determining the LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE of the Universe, by measuring the REDSHIFTS of a large, controlled sample of galaxies, either to a certain magnitude limit or in a specific region of the sky. A notable early achievement was the CfA Redshift Survey by Margaret GELLER and her team. Current redshift surveys, such as the 6dF (Six-degree Field) Galaxy Survey or the SLOAN DIGITAL SKY SURVEY , employ b undles of optical fibres, each precisely aimed at a different galaxy, to enable the spectra – and hence the redshifts – of several hundred galaxies to be obtained at one pointing of the telescope. Rees, Martin John (1942– ) English cosmologist and, from 1995, the fifteenth ASTRONOMER ROYAL , who has studied quasars, galaxy formation and clustering, and the cosmic microwave background radiation. His models of quasars were the first to show convincingly that they are supermassive black holes at the centres of distant galaxies. In the 1960s, his studies of quasar redshifts showed that their distribution increased with increasing distance, providing strong observational evidence for the Big Bang theory, and against the steady-state model. r eference stars Stars whose positions on the celestial sphere are known to a high degree of accuracy, allowing them to be used to measure the relative positions of other celestial objects.

This technique is used by planetary geologists to determine the mineralogical properties of the surfaces of planets and satellites without having actually to sample the rocks or subject them to geochemical analysis in the laboratory. See also SPECTROSCOPY re flecting telescope (reflector) Telescope that collects and focuses light using mirrors. After an unsuccessful a ttempt by James GREGORY in 1663 to make an all-mirror telescope, the first workable reflecting telescope was demonstrated to the Royal Society, London, by Isaac NEWTON in 1668. The lenses of the time all suffered from CHROMATIC ABERRATION , and the idea was to replace refracting lenses with a curved mirror. With the reflecting surface on the front face of the mirror, there was no need for the material of which the mirror was made to be trans- parent, so materials other than glass could be used. The first reflectors experimented with metal mirrors, as these w ere easier to manufacture. An alloy made from 68 parts copper and 32 parts tin, called speculum metal, was rou- tinely used until the late 19th century, and it was not until 200 years after Newton that Jean FOUCAULT made the first silver-on-glass mirror. The NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE uses a parabolic mirror surface to reflect the light falling upon it back to a single point known as the PRIME FOCUS . By introducing a small flat secondary mirror at 45º just before this focus, the cone of light is diverted through a right angle to an EYEPIECE mounted on the outside of the telescope tube. The magnification of the image is the FOCAL LENGTH of the mirror divided by the focal length of the eyepiece. With a mirror of 2000 mm focal length, for example, a 20-mm eyepiece will magnify 100 times. The FOCAL RATIO (focal length divided by APERTURE ) of common types of amateur reflectors is usually around f /8 or f /6. This means, for example, that a typical f /8 200-mm (8-in.) reflector will have a tube about 1.6 m (5.2 ft) long. In the 17th century, other mirror arrangements were devised. Some, like the GREGORIAN TELESCOPE , had such long focal lengths that they proved unwieldy and soon fell out of favour. The development in the late 17th cen- tury of the CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE , in which light is reflected back from the secondary through a hole in the primary mirror, allowed long focal lengths to be accom- modated in shorter, less cumbersome tube assemblies. In order not to have to perforate the primary, a small flat mirror can be introduced into the optical system to direct the light path outside the tube (sometimes along the dec- lination axis). This system is known as the Cassegrain/coudé ( see COUDÉ FOCUS ). Ve ry large mirrors suffer from distortion as they expand and contract with changes in temperature, posing problems for the constructors of large professional reflec- tors. This problem was reduced in the 1930s by making telescope mirrors from the newly developed Pyrex, which has a very low coefficient of linear expansion. The recent introduction of quartz and ceramics means that modern mirrors hardly expand or contract at all. Bernhard SCHMIDT and Dmitri MAKSUTOV designed and built the first corrector-plate telescopes. They were initially intended for photographic use, but can be adapt- ed to provide portable instruments for visual observing. All the various systems incorporate a corrector plate in front of the main mirror. There are several optical designs for this type of telescope, each giving a wide field at the prime focus which enables photographs to be taken of large areas of the sky. The most important and delicate parts of any reflecting telescope are the reflecting surfaces, and over the years many different materials have been tried in the quest for a durable COATING that will reflect the greatest possible amount of light. For many years silver was used, as a newly applied burnished finish will reflect 95% of visible light. Silver’s tendency to oxidize and tarnish renders it less durable than other coats, but it can readily be renewed. Aluminium was used from the 1930s. It reflects 87% of visible light, but its application requires the mirror to be placed in vacuum during deposition, so ALUMINIZ - ING is a job for professionals. Other metals have been tried, but their hardness requires abrasives to be used to remove them before recoating. Rhodium is least affected by chemical and physical ageing but is very expensive and has less reflec- tivity than either silver or aluminium. Overcoating alu- minium-coated mirrors has been experimented with to try to reduce oxidation and has proved successful in extending the life of the mirror surface. The length of time between aluminizations, however, will always depend on the care taken in looking after the telescope, the amount of use it gets and the air pollution at the tele- scope site.

A typical spacing density for the grooves in an optical reflection grating for astronomy is about 1000 gr ooves per millimetre, and the size of the separation (about one micrometre) is not much bigger than the wa v elength of light. Light of different wavelengths there- fore reflects from the grating in different directions ( DIF - FRACTION ) creating a high-quality spectrum.

In its simplest form, a refracting telescope consists of two LENSES , an OBJECTIVE and an EYEPIECE . In practice, both objective and eyepiece are compound lenses, consisting of two or more components. The objective is a lens of large APERTURE and long FOCAL LENGTH that forms an image of a remote object in its focal plane. The eyepiece is a smaller lens of short focal length that magnifies the image. The magnification equals the focal length of the objective divided by that of the eyepiece. The invention of the refracting telescope is usually credited to the Dutch optician Hans LIPPERSHEY , in 1608. The first astronomer to make serious regular telescopic observations was GALILEO in 1610, with telescopes of his o wn design and construction. The Galilean refractor had a convex (‘positive’) objective and a concave (‘negative’) eyepiece which was placed in front of the focal point of the objective. As a result it produced bright, erect images, b ut the field of view was small and the instruments were difficult to use. Simple lenses and telescope systems suffer from a range of optical defects, or ABERRATIONS , notably chromatic aberration and spherical aberration. Seventeenth-century astronomers realized that spherical aberration and, to a lesser extent, chromatic aberration, could be reduced by making gently curved lenses of very long focal length. This approach resulted in some extraordinary instruments. For example, Johannes HEVELIUS constructed several telescopes up to 46 m (150 ft) in length, with wooden lattice tubes which flexed badly. Christiaan HUYGENS developed an alternative design – the aerial telescope – with the objective fitted in a short tube at the top of a mast, and connected only by a cord to an eyepiece at ground level. In 1729 the English lawyer and amateur optician Chester Moor Hall (1703–71) realized that chromatic aberration could be substantially reduced by combining a positive lens made from ordinary crown glass with a negative lens made from flint glass – a harder material which contained lead and had a higher refractive index and a higher dispersion (a measure of the extent to which the different wavelengths are separated out by refraction). By careful selection of lens shapes, the chromatic aberration introduced by one lens could to a large extent be cancelled out by the other. A lens of this type is called achromatic, and the first one was built for Hall by the optician George Bass in 1733. An A CHROMAT (two-lens objective) can bring only two wa v elengths to a focus at exactly the same point, but the residual spread of focal points for the other wavelengths – the secondary spectrum – can be reduced by a factor of 30 or so compared with a single-lens objective. An apochromat is an objective – normally a triplet made from three types of glass – which brings three wa v elengths to the same focus and reduces the secondary spectrum even further. In practice, very few astronomical refractors have anything other than two-element objectives. Eyepieces, too, must be designed to minimize optical aberrations. With continuing improvements in materials, skills and optical technology, the 19th century became the heyday of the refractor. Although most refractors were conventional instruments, specialized designs were produced for specific purposes ( see TRANSIT INSTRUMENT ; HELIOMETER ). Coudé refractors used mirrors placed after the objective to reflect light to a fixed observing position, the COUDÉ FOCUS . In another va r iant, light was reflected into a fixed refractor by a SIDEROSTAT or COELOSTAT . The building of big refractors culminated in the 36-inch (0.9-m) instrument at LICK OBSERVATORY , and the 40-inch (1-m) refractor of the YERKES OBSERVATORY , installed in 1888 and 1897, respectively. The Yerkes instrument is highly unlikely ever to be surpassed. Compared with modern reflectors, large refractors have many disadvantages. Chromatic aberration cannot wholly be eliminated. As lenses become larger and thicker a significant amount of light is absorbed in them. Since a lens can be supported only around its edge (whereas a mirror can be supported across the whole of its rear surface), a large lens tends to flex under its own weight; the long tube itself tends to flex and needs to be housed in a large, expensive building. An achromatic doublet has four surfaces to be accurately shaped whereas a mirror has only one. All these factors combine to make a refractor very much more expensive than a reflector of the same aperture. Smaller refractors are widely used as guide instruments and still have a number of attractions for visual observers. Their optical components are less likely to go out of alignment than those of a reflector ( see COLLIMATION ). Refractors often seem to be less affected by temperature changes than reflectors, and the lack of obstructions in the light path together with the wholly enclosed tube (which cuts down air currents) is reckoned by devotees to contribute to better, steadier images on av erage, than those produced by reflectors of equal aperture.

Regiomontanus was one of the first publishers of astronomy literature, completing the translation of Ptolemy’s Almagest (which was published posthumously in 1496) begun by his mentor Georg von PURBACH . This work was not just a translation but also a critique of the Ptolemaic system, and it encouraged Nicholas Copernicus to devise his heliocentric model. After his death, a letter by Regiomontanus was discovered which stated in part that ‘the motion of the stars must vary a tiny bit on account of the motion of the Earth’; this is possibly the earliest exposition of the idea of stellar parallax.

Indeed, the walls and rims to the south and west are nearly gone, along with any evidence of this crater’s ejecta. A prominent central peak is offset to the north because of loss of the crater’s original wall as a result of the impact that created PURBACH .

The term was first suggested for Earth’s materials at the end of the 19th century, but it was not widely used until the 1960s, when it was applied to lunar surface material formed by multiple meteorite impacts. Lunar regolith consists mostly of unsorted fragments (from micrometres to metres across) of local bedrock, with an admixture of material brought ballistically from distant areas. Among the other components of regolith are the products of impact melting, such as pieces of glass (often containing unmelted mineral grains), and so-called regolith BRECCIA , in which small fragments of the bedrock and pieces of glass are cemented within a fine-grained matrix of the same composition. Lunar regolith is a few metres thick in lunar maria and thicker in lunar highlands. Regolith of Mercury and asteroids seems to be rather similar to lunar regolith. Regolith of Mars is thought to have been formed not only by meteorite bombardment but also by aeolian and, in the planet’s early history, fluvial erosion and accumulation. Regolith of icy satellites is fragmented ice with an admixture of non-icy components, such as organic materials and possibly silicates. r egression of the nodes Slow retrograde (westwards) motion of the NODES of the Moon’s orbit on the ecliptic, as a result of the gravitational attraction of the Sun. A full circuit takes 18.6 years, and it is the cause of the largest components of the NUTATION of the Earth’s axis of rotation, which also has a period of 18.6 years. In fact, regression of the nodes is a common property of all planets and satellites. For the planets it is caused by PERTURBATIONS of other planets, and for satellites it is caused mainly by the oblateness of the planet. The direction of motion is opposite to the direction of motion of the satellite, so for retrograde satellites (for example Triton, and some artificial Earth satellites), the nodes move around the equatorial plane of the planet in the direct sense.

Reinmuth discovered 270 asteroids, including many Trojan asteroids, and Hermes, which in 1937 came within 800,000 km (500,000 mi) of Earth. He also discovered two short-period comets. r elativity See GENERAL RELATIVITY ; SPECIAL RELATIVITY r elative sunspot number Daily index of sunspot activity, R , defined as R = k (10 g + f ), where k is a factor based on the estimated efficiency of observer and telescope (usually 1), g is the number of groups of sunspots (irrespective of the number of spots each contains), and f is the total number of individual spots in all the groups. The relative sunspot number has also been called the Wolf number and the Zürich number, after the pioneering sunspot records begun in 1848 by Rudolf W OLF at the Zürich Federal Observatory. While empirical, the formula gives a good indication of overall solar activity. r elaxation time ( R T ) Interval during which individual stars’ orbits within a star cluster will be changed significantly by the gravitational perturbations of other stars within the cluster. As a result, some stars will then have orbits that take them out of the cluster, and 1% of the stars will so escape over the relaxation time. In about 40 R T , the stars of the cluster will either escape or collapse down to the centre to form a black hole, and this is therefore the maximum lifetime of a star cluster. F or a GALACTIC CLUSTER like the PLEIADES , the relaxation time is around 10 million years, for a GLOBULAR CLUSTER it is a few hundred million years, while for a galaxy like the Milky Way it is a few hundred thousand million years. Renaissance astronomy Astronomy as practised in Renaissance Europe, from the recovery of authentic Greek astronomical texts in the mid-15th century, to the transition from ‘classical’ to Newtonian and telescopic astronomy in the mid-17th century. Renaissance astrono- my g rew out of the astronomical traditions of MEDIEVAL EUROPEAN ASTRONOMY , with its underlying concern with the calendar, tabular computation, and the cosmologies of Ptolemy and Aristotle. Its initial point of departure was the recovery of authentic Greek astronomical texts, to replace the corrupted Latin translations of the medieval universities, following the influx of Byzantine Greek scholars and books into Italy, especially after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. In Rome in the 1460s, Cardinal Johannes Bessarion (1395–1472) encouraged astronomers such as Georg von PURBACH and REGIOMONTANUS to study Ptolemy in the original Greek, and to undertake a programme of observations. Indeed, the run of solar declination observations made by Bernhard Walther (1430–1504) at Nuremberg with a large set of Ptolemy’s rulers between 1475 and 1504 effectively began observatory research in northern Europe. Reverential to the past as all of these astronomers were, they were active not only in producing accurate digests of Almagest , but also in comparing the Greek and Arab observations with positional measurements in their own day. Indeed, it was a concern with checking the ancients that initiated original, observation-based research in Renaissance Europe. Problems with the retrograde motions of Mars, Jupiter and Saturn led Nicholas COPERNICUS , who had previously made original planetary position observations in Bologna and Rome, to devise his heliocentric system of the heavens in 1513, though his monumental De revolutionibus w as not published until 1543. And, like a good classical scientist, Copernicus searched for heliocentric schemes amongst the ancient Greeks before publishing his own model. De revolutionibus , however, marked a decisive turning-point in astronomical history, because of the inevitable challenge put up by the heliocentric theory. If the Earth, against reason and common sense, both rotated on its axis and revolved around the Sun, then that motion should be detectable through the slight seasonal discrepancies displayed by astronomical bodies. The need to settle the question of a moving or stationary Earth by observation gave rise to the great enterprise of Tycho BRAHE . Uraniborg, his observatory on Hven island, Denmark, was Renaissance Europe’s g reatest centre of scientific research, with its graduate students, craftsmen, laboratories, workshops and printing press. Yet even Tycho’s superb instruments were unable to detect an annual P ARALLAX . What they did produce, however, was a body of observational data from which J ohannes KEPLER w ould derive his three laws of planetary motion based on elliptical orbits, which demanded the abandonment of the ancient pre-requisite of uniform circular motion. Renaissance astronomy came to its greatest fruition in GALILEO ’s revolutionary telescopic observations after 1610. He used his observations of the lunar ‘seas’, Jupiter’s four large satellites, sunspots and the stars of the Milky R r egolith 340 \u0001 r egolith This picture from Surveyor 5 shows the spacecraft’s footpad on the lunar surface following its 1967 landing.

Residuals of the measured positions of Solar System bodies compared with predicted positions are used in the process of improving the predicted orbit. For example, the predicted orbit of a natural satellite is computed from a mathematical model, or theory, which consists of a number of periodic PERTURBATION terms affecting the orbital elements, caused by the Sun, other satellites and the oblateness of the planet. The theory contains a number of parameters, the numerical values of which are determined from observations and have to be re- determined occasionally as the time base of the observations is extended. Typical parameters are the six ORBITAL ELEMENTS , the masses of the planet and other perturbing satellites, coefficients defining the oblate gr a vity field of the planet, and the orientation of the planet’s equator. Residuals of the observations from the theory are formed, using the current best set of parameters. The process of least squares is then used, which determines corrections to the parameters by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals. New residuals are formed using the corrected parameters. Mostly these residuals will be caused by the inevitable measurement errors that arise in making the observations. Ideally they should be scattered randomly, b ut there are always biases due to systematic errors of the observation method. There may also be signatures in the residuals as a result of inadequacies of the perturbation theory used, and this is the real incentive for the celestial mechanician – to produce a better theory, and perhaps to discover some new unexpected source of perturbation. r esolution Smallest detail visible in the image formed by an optical system. The resolution of a TELESCOPE and its instruments is limited by many factors. The over-riding one is the theoretical RESOLVING POWER of the telescope, which is determined by its APERTURE . Other limitations are the quality and design of the optics and the effects caused by the atmosphere. If the image is a direct representation of an object in the sky then the resolution will determine the level of spatial detail that can be discerned. If the image is produced by a SPECTROGRAPH then the resolution will determine the level of wavelength detail produced. re solving power Ability of an optical system to distinguish objects close to one another, such as the two components of a binary star, or a single small object. Resolving power is measured in angular units. A telescope’s theoretical resolving power in arcseconds is gi v en by dividing 115.8 by its aperture in millimetres (or 4.56 by the aperture in inches). This measure is called DA WES ’ LIMIT . A 150-mm (6-in.) telescope should be able to resolve objects separated by 0 \u0001 .8, but in practice ABERRATION , SEEING and imperfection in the observer’s eye prevent this limit from being achieved. The unaided human eye can resolve objects separated by about 1 \u0001 . r esonance Increased perturbing effect that occurs when an external force on a dynamical system has a frequency close to one of the natural frequencies of the system. In astronomy the prominent example is the large perturbing effect on an orbit as a result of a close COMMENSURABILITY of orbital period with another body. In recent work in CELESTIAL MECHANICS it has become common to use the word ‘resonance’ in place of the w ord ‘commensurability’. Thus one would refer to ‘the 2:1 resonance’ rather than ‘the resonance effect caused by the 2:1 commensurability’. Using this terminology, recent work in celestial mechanics commenced with efforts to explain the large number of resonances that occur between pairs of satellites. It is likely that TIDAL EVOLUTION of the orbits has caused one of the orbits to spiral outwards until a resonance was encountered. In many cases the satellite would pass straight through the resonance, but in some circumstances capture into the resonance can occur. The intricate detail of Saturn’s r ings revealed by the VOYA GER spacecraft, and the tenuous rings of Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune, have many features that have been explained by resonances with satellites ( see also SHEPHERD MOON ). The same va r iety of types of resonance occur as those between pairs of satellites, but because they are acting on a ring of particles rather than a single body their effects are rather different, causing clusters around a ring, and radial density variations. Several types of resonance have been given particular names taken from the field of galactic dynamics, including linblad, vertical and corotation resonances. r est mass Mass of a body when it is stationary. Strictly, it is the mass of a body measured when it is at rest in an inertial frame of reference. According to the theory of RELATIVITY , if a body has a finite rest mass, its mass increases as its speed increases and would become infinite if it could be made to travel at the speed of light. Photons (which travel at the speed of light) have zero rest mass. r esurfacing Renewal of a portion of a planetary surface by covering with fresh material, which is usually erupted from beneath the surface. Rocky bodies are resurfaced by the eruption of lava, whereas icy bodies are resurfaced by floods of water freezing on the surface. Resurfacing erases previously existing features and ‘resets the clock’ for accumulation of craters, by which the new surface may be dated. r etardation Change in moonrise times on successive nights.

Because the planets orbit the Sun at different velocities, those closer to it travelling faster than those farther away, the Earth periodically catches up with and ‘overtakes’ a superior planet when it is at opposition. This has the effect of causing that planet to appear to stand still against the stellar background and to describe a loop (most prominently in the case of Mars) before continuing its normal apparent west–east movement. The path it traces out is known as a retrograde loop, and the places at which it appears to change direction are known as stationary points. r evolution Movement of a planet or other celestial body around its ORBIT , as distinct from the ROTA TION of the body around its axis.

Rhea Second-largest satellite of SATURN ; it was discovered in 1672 by G.D. CASSINI . Rhea’s icy surface is ve ry heavily scarred by impact craters, with no clear evidence of CRYOVOLCANISM or other resurfacing processes. It is thus one of the few large satellites of the outer planets to have a surface that resembles what was expected before the role that tidal heating can play in driving these processes came to be appreciated. The VOYA GER image coverage of Rhea was patchy. Details as small as about 2 km (1 mi) were revealed in the north polar region, which is heavily cratered, whereas most images of the Saturn-facing hemisphere are only good enough to show details down to 20 km (12 mi). The resolution of the best images of the opposite hemisphere is even poorer. There appear to be a few fractures and some va ri a tions in crater density, but Rhea has little in common with its neighbouring satellite, DIONE , other than that observations by the Hubble Space Telescope have revealed ozone trapped within the ice on both bodies. The ozone is probably formed by the breakdown of water mol- ecules in the same manner as on Jupiter’s icy Galilean satellites.

Rho Ophiuchi Dark Cloud Complex group of NEBULAE on the Ophiuchus–Scorpius border. It is about 500 to 600 l.y. from the Earth and its apparent size on the sky extends over an area about 300 times larger than the Moon. Nearby nebulosities around \u0002 Scorpii (Antares) and \u0003 Scorpii add to the complexity of the region. The cloud contains a large amount of irregularly distributed dust, which blocks the visible light of the stars within it and behind it. The apparently empty dark areas represent the regions where the absorption of light is the greatest ( see D ARK NEBULAE and PIPE NEBULA ). Nevertheless, the cloud can be penetrated to the core at radio and infrared wa v elengths, and this has revealed evidence for the existence of more than 60 young stars buried in the cloud and several compact HII REGIONS . It is estimated that about 10 per cent of the mass of the cloud has already condensed to form new stars.

As Earth, moving more rapidly on its smaller orbit, catches up, Mars’ eastwards motion apparently slows, then reverses re lative to the background stars as Earth overtakes around opposition.

In its original state, Riccioli was a complex crater with a central peak and terraced walls. It then underwent intense bombardment, notably by the ejecta from the ORIENTALE basin-forming event. Later yet, lava flooded the inner region, and meteorite erosion further degraded the crater. Now Riccioli appears as a deeply degraded rim with a central lava plain. It is crossed by numerous rilles. Richard of Wallingford ( c. 1292–1336) English churchman-astronomer, abbot of St Albans and a pioneer of mechanical clockwork. He designed a clock for the abbey whose dial was a planispheric astrolabe showing the daily rotation of the sky, and the positions of the Sun and Moon. The most sophisticated device of its kind, it was essentially a model of the medieval cosmos. Richer, Jean (1630–96) French astronomer, explorer and surveyor whose work during a scientific expedition to Cayenne, French Guyana (1671–73), helped to establish the scale of the Solar System and the shape of the Earth. From Richer’s observations of Mars from South America, Giovanni Domenico CASSINI derived a good approximation for the ASTRONOMICAL UNIT . Richer also found that a pendulum at Cayenne, near the equator, ran more slowly than at Paris, which meant that gravity at the equator was slightly weaker than at far northerly latitudes, a result later used by Isaac Newton and others to show that the Earth is flattened at its poles. rich-field telescope (RFT) Low-power telescope that is equipped with a wide-angle eyepiece (such as a NAGLER EYEPIECE ) designed to show a wide (2–5º) field of view at a relatively low magnification.

It is occasionally expressed in degrees but is usually measured in hours, minutes and seconds of sidereal time and is equal to the interval between the TRANSIT or CULMINATION of the First Point of Aries and that of the celestial body. One hour of right ascension is equal to 15º of arc.

Examples of arcuate rilles are seen around Mare Serenitatis and Mare Humorum. Floor fractures are characterized by radial or concentric fractures in crater floors. Such craters occur along mare boundaries, suggesting that the lava that filled the basin also tracked up faults beneath these craters and collected beneath their floors, fracturing them into plates. ring, planetary Band of particles orbiting a planet inside its R OCHE LIMIT , where tidal forces prevent them from accreting into a satellite. All four of the large outer planets are surrounded by ring systems, which have complex and varied structures. JUPITER has a narrow, tenuous ring of small particles, probably of silicate composition, at about 1.8 planetary radii. It is surrounded by a halo of charged grains of micrometre size, which are levitated by the planet’s mag- netic field. The outer ‘gossamer’ ring has a very low densi- ty and extends out to 2.9 radii. SATURN has three broad main rings, named C, B and A, in order of distance outwards from the planet. They extend from 1.2 to 2.3 planetary radii. There is also a faint inner D ring, which may extend down to the top of the planet’s atmosphere. Despite their great width, these rings are less than 100 m (330 ft) thick. They consist of parti- cles of sizes from about 1 cm to 10 m (0.3–33 ft), which are composed mostly of water ice. The main rings have radial variations in density and several gaps, such as the CASSINI DIVISION , which are produced by satellite pertur- bations. Saturn also has a narrow F ring confined between two small satellites, P ANDORA and PROMETHEUS . The ten- uous E and G rings consist mainly of micrometre-sized g rains; the E ring extends out to about 8 planetary radii. URANUS has 11 narrow rings of widths 5 to 100 km (3–60 mi) in the region 1.45 to 2 radii. They are separated by wide gaps containing dust and believed to be occupied by unseen small satellites. NEPTUNE has two broad and four narrow dusty rings between 1.65 and 2.4 radii; the outermost contains denser regions known as RING ARCS . The rings of Uranus and Neptune consist of dark materi- al, probably of carbon-rich composition; both sets of rings contain bodies of metre to kilometre size. Much of our knowledge of these ring systems comes from the VOYA GER spacecraft. Their varied configurations are due primarily to gravitational perturbations by satel- lites in their vicinity. Saturn’s rings may either be primor- dial or the result of tidal disruption of a captured large cometary body or CENTAUR . The other ring systems, which are much less massive, are probably the result of disruption of small satellites by cometary impacts. The fine dust in these systems is constantly renewed by mete- oroid bombardment of the larger ring particles. ring arcs Longitudinal structures within the outermost of Neptune’s rings over which the ring’s brightness varies by about a factor of three. They extend for between 1º and 10º. Five such regions were discovered by the VOYA GER 2 spacecraft. As orbital motions of ring particles would quickly even out such features, they must be maintained by some mechanism, most likely resonant perturbations by one or more small satellites.

Ring galaxies are thought to arise as a result of a DENSITY WAVE produced when a small galaxy passes through a larger one. Ring galaxies are also distinct from ringed galaxies, in which normal stellar dynamics (often in the presence of a bar) have channelled stars into a prominent ring about the galaxy’s centre. Collisional rings often have an off-centre nucleus, or none at all.

He served under George Ellery HALE as chief optician and then head of instrument construction at Yerkes Observatory (1899–1904) and Mount Wilson Observatory (1905–09). Ritchey designed and built both the optics and mounting for Mount Wilson’s 60-inch (1.5-m) reflector, and figured the optics for the 100-inch (2.5-m) HOOKER TELESCOPE . He used these instruments to take photographs of nebulae and galaxies that showed more detail than could be observed visually, and concluded that spiral galaxies are similar to our own Milky Way. In 1917 he made some of the first distance estimates to M31, using novae and supernovae as ‘standard candles’. In 1923 Ritchey emigrated to France, becoming director of Paris Observatory’s astrophotographic laboratory (1924–30).

He found that for a parent and satellite of equal density the equilibrium point is about 2.5 times the radius of the parent; a satellite venturing any closer than this will be broken apart by tidal gravitational forces. Roche limit Minimum distance from a planet at which a satellite can remain intact, without being torn apart by gr a vitational forces. It was noted in 1848 by Édouard R OCHE that a satellite orbiting close to its planet is subjected to great stresses because the nearer parts of its body try to orbit faster than the more distant parts. If close enough, these stresses will exceed the mechanical strength of the satellite, and it will be ripped apart. Also, at this distance a ring of particles will never be able to form into a satellite by A CCRETION . The Roche limit is usually quoted as 2.5 times the planet’s radius, though it is now recognised that it depends strongly on the internal strength of the satellite, and also slightly on the densities of the planet and satellite. For a body in hydrostatic equilibrium (that is, little internal strength) the limit is about 2.46 radii, and for a small rocky satellite it is about 1.44 radii. The r ing systems of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all lie within their planet’s hydrostatic Roche limit. Roche lobe Surface that defines the maximum sizes of stars in a BINARY STAR system relative to their separation. If both components are well within their Roche lobes, the system is termed a DETACHED BINARY . If one component fills its Roche lobe, material escapes through the inner LAGRANGIAN POINT , L 1 , on to its companion, and the system is termed a SEMIDETACHED BINARY . If both stars fill their Roche lobes, the system is a CONTACT BINARY . In contact binaries, material can escape entirely from the system through the outer Lagrangian points, L 2 , creating common envelope binaries. ROE Abbreviation of RO YA L OBSERVATORY , EDINBURGH r ocket astronomy Astronomical research carried out using instruments flown on suborbital rockets. Today, most astronomical observations are undertaken either from ground-based observatories or from orbiting satel- lites, but important discoveries have been made using instruments carried on balloons ( see BALLOON ASTRONO - MY ) and suborbital sounding rockets. Sounding rockets provide the only means of making in situ measurements between the maximum altitude for balloons, about 50 km (30 mi), and the minimum altitude for satellites, about 160 km (100 mi). Larger rockets can be flown to altitudes of more than 1300 km (800 mi) and can carry payloads of up to 550 kg. Rocket-borne experiments are valuable for studies of the upper atmosphere and the Earth’s radiation belts, and have also led to breakthroughs in our knowledge of the Sun, stars and galaxies. During the first half of the 20th century, astronomers became increasingly aware that, although visible light from cosmic sources penetrates to the Earth’s surface, most other wavelengths are absorbed or reflected by the at mosphere. The solution was to lift instruments above the blanket of air, but the enabling technology became av ailable only after World War II, when captured German V -2 missiles were put to more peaceful uses. On 1946 October 19, V-2 carried a spectrometer above the ozone layer to make the first detection of ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. Proof that X-rays were emitted by the Sun came in 1949, when Herbert FRIEDMAN flew Geiger counters on a modified V-2 launched from White Sands, New Mexico. Another early pioneer of rocket astronomy was James VA N ALLEN , who flew experiments from White Sands on the Aerobee rocket to observe cos- mic rays before they collided with Earth’s upper atmos- phere. The use of sounding rockets for scientific research received a boost during the INTERNATIONAL GEOPHYSICAL YEAR (IGY) of 1957–58, which coincided with a period of enhanced solar activity. Almost 300 suborbital rockets w ere launched during the IGY by the United States, and another 175 by the Soviet Union. By the late 1950s, X-ray observations from sounding rockets had shown that the temperature of the solar corona reaches several million degrees. Such observations revolutionized our under- standing of nuclear reactions inside the Sun, but it was more difficult to capture the small amounts of short-wave radiation from more distant cosmic sources. The initial breakthrough came when a rocket-borne spectrograph developed by Donald Morton (1933– ) and Lyman SPITZER of Princeton University made the first detection of ultraviolet light from two stars in the constellation Scorpius. Within a short time, several hun- dred stars as faint as magnitude 6.5 had been observed in the ultraviolet. The first detection of cosmic X-rays came on 1962 June 18, when a team led by Italian physicist Riccardo GIACCONI discovered a distant source in Scorpius, which they called SCORPIUS X -1, and a completely unexpected diffuse glow of X-rays known as the cosmic X-ray back- g round. The following year, Friedman found a second source, Taurus X-1, which was later shown to be the X-ray counterpart of the CRAB NEBULA . Over the next 10 y ears, rocket surveys revealed more than 40 X-ray R r ocket astronomy 345 \u0001 Roche lobe In a binary star system, the stars (here marked M 1 and M 2 ) have their own gravitational sphere of influence, defined by the Roche lobe. Dependent on the evolutionary state and relative masses of the partners in a binary system, material from one star, or both, may fill the respective Roche lobes. Overspill of material from a distended, highly evolved star from its Roche lobe into that of a smaller more massive partner is an important driving mechanism in several forms of cataclysmic variable stars.

Advances in infrared astronomy suffered from the diffi- culties of developing instruments and operating them at ve ry low temperatures. The first success was the project HISTAR to launch a 166-mm (6 \u0001 \u0002 -in.) telescope cooled by liquid helium. Seven flights were made from White Sands between 1972 April and December, with two more from Australia in 1974 to survey the southern sky. Although the total observing time was only about 30 min- utes, the project generated a catalogue of more than 2000 celestial infrared sources. Much of the research previously undertaken with sounding rockets has since been taken over by orbiting observatories, but sounding rockets are still widely used in the United States, Europe, Japan, India and Brazil. NASA currently uses 13 different suborbital launchers and con- ducts about 25 launches annually from sites at White Sands, Wallops Island and Poker Flat in Alaska, although many of these are devoted to microgravity experiments rather than astronomy. Their rapid launch capability and recovery time (a typ- ical flight lasts no more than half an hour) and relatively low cost also ensure that suborbital rockets still have an important role to play. Their quick response capability w as demonstrated by the launch of six NASA rockets from Australia in 1987–88 to monitor SUPERNOVA 1987 A . Sounding rockets also serve as low-cost test-beds for new techniques, instrumentation and technology intended for future satellite missions. For example, the payloads flown to study Supernova 1987A included the first pho- ton-counting CCD X-ray camera ever flown. NASA mis- sions that have benefited from precursor flights include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and the Transition Region And Coronal Explorer (TRACE). Current research areas for rocket astronomy include observations of the ionosphere, the aurora and processes in the magnetosphere, together with X-ray studies of the Sun and supernova remnants. These frequently take place as part of coordinated observational programmes involv- ing ground-based instruments and satellite overpasses, for example during total solar eclipses. Römer, Ole Christensen (1644–1710) Danish astronomer, the first to obtain a reasonable approximation for the value of the speed of light ( c ). In 1671 Römer, then professor of astronomy at the University of Copenhagen, w as offered a post at P ARIS OBSERVATORY by J ean Picard (1620–82), who was impressed with the accuracy of the Dane’s measurements. At Paris, the director Giovanni Domenico CASSINI had instigated a broad programme of observations with the object of drawing up tables that could be used by navigators to find longitude at sea. It had been suggested that the periodic eclipses by Jupiter of the Galilean satellites would provide a suitable standard. In 1675 Römer, checking eclipse times based on predic- tions by Cassini, found that they did not match the observed times: intervals between successive eclipses decreased as the orbital motions of the Earth and Jupiter brought them closer together, and increased as the two planets moved farther apart. Römer correctly deduced that the differences were caused by light taking a finite time to travel the intervening distance. The next year, he was able to announce a value for c equivalent to about 225,000 km/s (140,000 mi/s), three-quarters of the true value. Römer returned to his homeland in 1681, becoming the Danish Astronomer Royal in Copenhagen, where he invented the transit telescope. r oof prism Optical component often used in compact binoculars to produce an image that is the right way up and the right way round as seen by the user. The OBJECTIVES and EYEPIECES in a pair of binoculars would produce inverted images if used alone, so another component such as a roof prism must be placed between them to cancel out this inversion. Unlike the PORRO PRISMS that they are beginning to replace where size is important, roof prisms permit the objectives and eyepieces to be in line, leading to a more compact shape. Roque de los Muchachos Observatory (Observato- r io del Roque de los Muchachos, ORM) Major optical astronomy facility on the island of La Palma in the Canary Islands at an elevation of 2400 m (7870 ft). It occupies some 2 sq km (0.8 sq mi) on the highest peak of the Caldera de Taburiente and is named after the ‘Rock of the Companions’ at the very highest point. The observatory belongs to the INSTITUTO DE ASTROFÍSICA DE CANARIAS (IAC), and was developed jointly by Spain, the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden. The site was estab- lished as an observatory in 1979 and inaugurated in 1985. Its clear skies, atmospheric stability and freedom from light pollution make it one of the northern hemisphere’s best locations for optical astronomy. The ORM’s facilities include the 4.2-m (165-in.), 2.54-m (100-in.) and 1.0-m (39-in.) telescopes of the ISAAC NEWTON GROUP , the 3.5-m (138-in.) GALILEO NATIONAL TELESCOPE and the 2.6-m (102-in.) NORDIC OPTICAL TELESCOPE . Other instruments include the Carls- berg Automatic Meridian Circle for positional astronomy, the HEGRA gamma-ray facility and a solar tower operat- ed by Sweden.

Rosette Nebula (NGC 2237-2239) Large, visually rather faint EMISSION NEBULA in northern Monoceros (RA 06 h 32 m .3 dec. \u0001 05º03 \u0002 ). Covering an area of 80 \u0002\u0003 60 \u0002 , the Rosette emits strongly in the wavelength of hydrogen-alpha and is well recorded on red-sensitive films. The Rosette lies 4900 l.y. away and has an actual diameter of 90 l.y. Embedded within it is the bright star cluster NGC 2244, the stars of which formed from the nebulosity about 500,000 years ago. Ultraviolet emission from NGC 2244’s hot O-class stars has cleared a central cavity of about 30 l.y. in diameter in the nebula. Star formation is probably still going on here: detailed images reveal the presence of numerous Bok GLOBULES in the Rosette. Several sections of the outer ring have been assigned their own NGC numbers. Ross, Frank Elmore (1874–1960) American astronomer whose work covered celestial mechanics, optical design and astrophotography. In 1905, while at the Carnegie Institution, he computed the orbit of Saturn’s satellite Phoebe. As director of the International Latitude Observatory in Maryland (1905–15), he designed and built the first PHOTOGRAPHIC ZENITH TUBE (1911) for use in a programme to determine precisely the wobble of the Earth’s rotational axis. Ross spent the next nine years at Eastman Kodak, where he designed wide-angle photographic lenses and developed highly sensitive photographic emulsions for imaging faint astronomical objects. He then moved to Yerkes Observatory (1924–39), where he carried out photographic surveys of our Galaxy that resulted in Atlas of the Northern Milky Way (1934–36) and New Proper- Motion Stars (1929–39), a catalogue of stars he discovered with high proper motions. Rosse, Third Earl of (William Parsons) (1800–1867) Irish amateur astronomer who constructed large telescopes used to discover the spiral structure of galaxies. After serving as a member of parliament (1821–34), he determined to build reflecting telescopes to rival those of William HERSCHEL . His largest instrument, known as the Leviathan of Parsonstown, had an aperture of 72 inches (1.8 m). Working at special workshops built at his estate in Birr, Ireland, Parsons developed a new method of casting mirrors from a solid disk; he invented a ventilator that solved the common problem of the metal cracking during the cooling process. The Leviathan’s primary mirror was cast in 1842; Parsons built a steam-driven machine to grind and polish its surface to the desired shape. The rest of the telescope was completed in 1845. Parsons used his big reflectors to survey the star clus- ters and nebulous objects of the northern sky; they clearly showed the spiral arms of galaxies such as M51, the Whirlpool Galaxy, which he sketched. He discovered 15 spiral galaxies and gave the Crab Nebula (M1) its name. His son Laurence Parsons (1840–1908), the fourth earl, continued to work with the Leviathan, but after he died it was dismantled. Another son, Charles Algernon Parsons, was an engineer who continued Howard Grubb’s tele- scope-making business under the name GRUBB , PARSONS & CO .

After chairing the physics department (1932–38) at Padua, Italy, Rossi emigrated to Denmark, England and finally the USA, where he held the chair of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1946–71). In the 1930s Rossi had shown that cosmic rays are highly energetic, positively charged particles that constantly bombard the Earth; in the late 1950s he made pioneering studies of the interplanetary medium, finding it to consist of highly ionized gases. In 1963 Rossi and his team discovered Scorpius X-1, the first known extraterrestrial source of X-rays besides the Sun, opening up the field of high-energy astronomy. The Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite, launched in 1995, was named after him. rota ting variable VARIABLE STAR that exhibits variations in light output as it rotates; the variations are a result of its ellipsoidal shape (with consequent changes in apparent surface area) or its non-uniform surface luminosity. The latter may arise through starspots or through magnetic effects, as in stars where the rotational axis does not coincide with the magnetic axis (‘oblique rotators’), or through reflection. See also ALPHA 2 CANUM VENATICORUM STAR ; BY DRACONIS STAR ; ELLIPSOIDAL VARIABLE ; REFLECTION VARIABLE rotation Spinning motion of a body around an axis as opposed to orbital motion about another body. The time it takes a celestial body to complete one revolution about its rotational axis is a measure of the length of its day. Some degree of rotation seems to be a general property of all classes of celestial body. rotation curve Plot of the way in which the average linear velocities through space of stars and nebulae within a GALAXY vary with their distances from the centre of the galaxy. If stars orbited in a manner similar to the planets in the Solar System, then the rotation curve would show a steady decrease with increasing distance from the centre. Instead, for many galaxies the velocity is more-or-less constant away from the central regions of the galaxy. This is probably due to large amounts of matter being present in the galaxy’s halo and corona.

Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) Britain’s main organization for professional astronomers (though amateurs are admitted), founded in 1820 and receiving its Royal Charter in 1831. The Society’s aims are the encouragement and promotion of astronomy and geophysics, which it achieves by publishing the results of scientific research and holding regular meetings. Its main publications are Monthly Notices and Geophysical Journal International , both of which have international reputations. The RAS headquarters are at Burlington House, Piccadilly, London. Royal Astronomical Society of Canada (RASC) Principal astronomical body in Canada, with a membership of around 4500 amateur and professional astronomers. Originally established in the mid-19th century, the organization was granted its Royal Charter in 1903.

A bi-monthly J ournal publishes observational reports and analyses, and the annual RASC Observer’s Handbook is a useful guide to astronomical phenomena. Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand (RASNZ) New Zealand’s main organization for amateur and professional astronomers, who work in close collaboration principally on variable star observations and their analysis. Founded in 1920, the RASNZ received its Royal Charter in 1967 and is based in Wellington. It has around 200 members drawn from the islands. Observational work is coordinated by special interest g roups and sections, with reports published in a quarterly journal Southern Stars . Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) Britain’s for- mer national astronomy institution, so named after its move from GREENWICH OBSERVATORY in 1948. The new location at Herstmonceux Castle, near Eastbourne, Sus- sex, offered much-improved observing conditions, and by 1958 the move was complete. A comprehensive suite of telescopes at the new site included the 0.91-m (36-in.) Y app Reflector (which was formerly at Greenwich), the largest instrument at Herstmonceux until the 2.5-m (98-in.) ISAAC NEWTON TELESCOPE w as completed in 1967. In the 1970s, the RGO played a major role in developing the RO QU ED E LOS MUCHACHOS OBSERVATORY , eventually the home of the ISAAC NEWTON GROUP OF TELESCOPES . With the shift in emphasis to ov erseas observing, there was no need for telescopes on British soil, and the RGO underwent a controversial and protracted move to Cambridge in 1990. Further contro- ve r sy over the location of a UK ASTRONOMICAL TECH - NOLOGY CENTRE led to the closure of the RGO in 1998 October, bringing to an end 323 years of distinguished astronomical achievement. Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope Originally a southern-hemisphere outstation of the GREENWICH OBSERVATORY , the observatory was proposed in 1821 and completed in 1828 near Cape Town, South Africa. Dur- ing the 19th century, it generated most of the accurate star positions measured in the southern skies. Under David GILL the observatory’s work was expanded to include the compilation of star catalogues from photographic surveys ( see CAPE PHOTOGRAPHIC DURCHMUSTERUNG ). At the beginning of 1972 the observatory broke its 140-year- long association with the RO YA L GREENWICH OBSERVATORY and became the SOUTH AFRICAN ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVA - TORY .

Royal Observatory, Edinburgh (ROE) Scotland’s national observatory from 1822 until the formation of the UK ASTRONOMICAL TECHNOLOGY CENTRE (ATC) in 1998. It began its life at Calton Hill, Edinburgh, where it rose to prominence under the direction of Charles Piazzi SMYTH , Astronomer Royal for Scotland 1846–1888. A move in 1896 to its present site at Blackford Hill, 3 km (2 mi) south of the city centre, allowed the observatory to escape the pollution of Edinburgh, and in 1928 a new 0.91-m (36-in.) reflector was installed. The ROE’s outsta- tion at Monte Porzio Catone, Italy, was opened in 1967, followed by the UNITED KINGDOM SCHMIDT TELESCOPE in 1973 and the UNITED KINGDOM INFRARED TELESCOPE in 1979. Growing expertise in astronomical technology even- tually led to ROE being selected as the UK’s ATC in 1998. With the transfer of its remaining astronomy support func- tions to the INSTITUTE FOR ASTRONOMY , UNIVERSITY OF EDINBURGH (with which the observatory had always had close ties), ROE formally ceased to exist. However, the name is retained for the site and the Visitor Centre. r process Method of creating heavy stable nuclei within the interiors of stars by successive capture of neutrons.

See also NUCLEOSYNTHESIS ; PP R OCESS ; SP R OCESS RR Lyrae variable (RR) Type of pulsating V ARIABLE STAR . RR Lyrae stars are radially pulsating GIANTS of spectral classes A–F, with periods that are generally fractions of a day. At visible wavelengths their amplitudes are 0.2–2 mag. These stars are often called short-period Cepheids or cluster variables. The latter name originated when Solon BAILEY , in 1895, discovered numerous examples in GLOBULAR CLUSTERS . It was soon found that some of the brightest globular clusters contained many of these stars, and within a few y ears hundreds had been found. These rapidly pulsating stars have light-curves that dif- fer from classical CEPHEID VARIABLES . Most rise very quickly to maximum in only a tenth or less of their total period. Their minima are comparatively prolonged, so that for a few hours their light remains constant. Their periods range from 1.2 to 0.2 days. In 1900 the first short- period Cepheid was found outside a globular cluster; it w as discovered by Williamina Fleming, at Harvard, and w as RR Lyrae, the type star of these variables. At first it w as thought that this star must have escaped from a glob- ular cluster, but as more and more such stars were discov- ered away from globular clusters the idea was dropped. There are now more than 6000 of these stars known (including subtypes), and roughly half are found in clus- ters. Most have periods between 9 and 17 hours, with many around 13 hours. In the Small Magellanic Cloud some RR Lyrae stars have periods as long as two days, but apart from these there is a fairly sharp cut-off in periods after 1.2 days. RR Lyrae variables are giant stars; those in our Galaxy belong to the halo component. Some are known to have va r iable light-curve shapes as well as variable periods.

Some stars show two simultaneous operating pulsating modes – the fundamental and the first overtone; such stars are placed in a subtype of RR Lyrae variables designated RRB. Another subtype (RRAB) has stars with asymmet- r ic light-curves, with steep rises and periods from 0.3 to 1.2 days. Their amplitudes range from 0.5 to 2 mags. The type star, RR Lyrae, belongs to the RRAB subtype. Stars of another subtype (RRC) have nearly symmetrical (sinu- soidal) light-curves with periods of 0.2 to 0.5 days and amplitudes that do not exceed 0.8 mag. The absolute magnitude of RR Lyrae variables is about \u0001 0.5. They are too faint to be seen in any but the nearest external galax- ies, such as the dwarf system in Sculptor. Those found in the Magellanic Clouds are at about the observable limit. RR Lyrae variables may be used as distance indicators out to about 650,000 l.y. The method used depends on the star’s motion in space. It is assumed that all the stars in a globular cluster are at about the same distance and therefore have the same velocities in space. The RADIAL VELOCITY is one-third of the total space velocity. With these assumptions, the approximate distance to a globular cluster is found and this, in turn, gives its absolute magni- tude. From the absolute magnitudes of clusters the size of the Galaxy may be calculated, because the globular clus- ters form a halo around it. It is then possible to extend these measurements to the nearest external galaxies.

Class R stars, recognized by bands of C 2 , CN and CH, describe spectra that track o xygen-rich stars from class G4 to M1 (5000 to 3600 K).

Rubin, Vera Cooper (1928– ) American astronomer who discovered the first persuasive observational evidence for the existence of dark matter in galaxies. Working at the Carnegie Institution from 1965, Rubin specialized in galaxy dynamics and clustering. In 1978 she and her colleagues observed that giant gas clouds in galaxies showed high rotational velocities that were consistent with a ‘dark matter’ model first proposed five years earlier by J eremiah Ostriker (1937– ) and Jim PEEBLES . She realized that only haloes of dark matter beyond the visible boundaries of these galaxies could keep the gas clouds orbiting. Rubin also discovered (1951) peculiar velocities of galaxies as they move through intergalactic space, suggesting that the Universe’s LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE is less uniform than previously thought. runaway star Star moving with very high space veloci- ty, typically hundreds of kilometres per second. They are usually of spectral class O or B. Some are thought to have been ejected from a CLOSE BINARY system when its com- panion exploded as a supernova.

See also HIGH - VELOCITY STAR Russell, Henry Norris (1877–1957) American astronomer, famous for first publishing what is now called the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM (HR diagram). After graduating from Princeton University, he received his PhD there (1899) for a new way of determining binary star orbits. From 1902 he worked with Arthur Robert Hinks (1873–1945) at Cambridge University, determin- ing stellar distances (and hence absolute magnitudes, M ) by parallactic measurements on photographic plates. Rus- sell returned to Princeton, where he became professor of astronomy (1911–27) and observatory director (1912–47), and a major figure in US astrophysics. Back at Princeton, he built on his work at Cambridge and discovered a correlation between M and the spectral types that were being assigned by Annie CANNON at Har- v ard. In 1913 he produced what was initially known as the Russell diagram , on which he plotted M against Harvard spectral type for over 300 stars. Immediately apparent were the MAIN SEQUENCE r unning from top left to bottom right, and giant stars across the top. (Unknown to Russell, Ejnar HERTZSPRUNG had done the same some years previously, but had published his results in an obscure journal and in a form less easy to interpret.) The Hertzsprung–Russell diagram is the starting-point for all modern theories of stellar evolution, though Russell first thought, erroneously, that a star began its life as a giant and evolved down the main sequence to become a red dwarf. Russell continued to study binaries throughout his life, developing a method for estimating the sizes and orbits of eclipsing binaries. He also studied the solar spectrum, using the SAHA EQUATION , and in 1928–29 was able to confirm Cecilia PA YNE - GAPOSCHKIN ’s earlier finding that hydrogen is the major constituent of the Sun and other stars.

Beginning in 1858, he used an 11.5-inch (290-mm) refractor by Henry Fitz (1808–63) to take some of the earliest photographs of the Sun, Moon and planets, and of stars as faint as 5th magnitude.

Rutherfurd obtained a solar spectrum that showed three times as many spectral lines as the best previous examples. RV T auri star (RV) Highly luminous, pulsating V ARIABLE STAR . Members of this small group are mainly y ellow or orange SUPERGIANT stars in spectral classes G and K, with some F stars. Examples are RV Tauri, R Sagittae and R Scuti. Their enormous, very extended a tmospheres of gas emit infrared radiation. The light- curves of the RV Tauri stars are characterized by alternating deep and shallow minima, which may occasionally exchange places. Their periods range from about 30 to 145 days. Sometimes the light variations may become rather irregular, particularly for the stars having the longest periods. For this reason the RV Tauri stars are classified as SEMIREGULAR VARIABLES . They also have a va ri a tion in their COLOUR INDEX (an indication of the temperature of the star) that looks like the light-curve, but goes through its maximum shortly before the star reaches minimum brightness. There are two distinct photometric subtypes: one (RVA) exhibits the behaviour just described; in the second subtype (RVB) the characteristic va ri a tions are superimposed on a longer-period fluctuation, with an amplitude of about two magnitudes and a typical period of 600–1500 days. R Sagittae and RV Tauri itself are both RVB stars. RW Aurigae variable Ve ry y oung star, a member of a subclass of NEBULAR VARIABLE or TTA URI STARS . The RW Aurigae stars have quite large amplitudes and are almost all G-type DW ARFS . Very few are brighter than 10th magnitude at maximum. They show rapid and extremely irregular variations in their light-curves, although some stars appear to have a pseudo-periodic wave superimposed upon the primary light variations. Many RW Aurigae stars are found associated with the T ORIONIS VARIABLES . Ryle, Martin (1918–84) English astronomer, the twelfth ASTRONOMER ROYAL , who established Cambridge as a centre for radio astronomy, and pioneered radio interfer- ometry and aperture synthesis. He joined Cambridge University’s Cavendish Laboratory after working on radar during World War II, and became director of the MULLARD RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY (MRAO) in 1957, and the university’s first professor of radio astrono- my two years later. Ryle saw that the immediate task facing radio astronomers was to map the sky at radio wavelengths. He chose to do this by building the first RADIO INTERFEROME - TERS , for which MRAO became famous. In 1950 he insti- gated the first of the Cambridge surveys, the most important of which was the third, completed in 1959, which yielded the THIRD CAMBRIDGE CATALOGUE (‘3C’) of some five hundred radio sources. He and his colleagues developed the technique of APERTURE SYNTHESIS in which an array of small instruments provide the sensitivity of a much larger single collector. The first such instrument, the One-Mile Telescope, was completed in 1963; its suc- cessor was the Five-Kilometre Telescope, since renamed the R YLE TELESCOPE . The Cambridge surveys and radio telescopes advanced knowledge of PULSARS and QU ASARS , and the number of distant radio sources lent support to the Big Bang theory.

His detailed, comprehensive and mathematically rigorous theory of the formation of planets from a circumstellar disk of gas and dust underlies present-day research. He recognized that the rate of collisions among planetesimals, which led to gr o wth by A CCRETION , was controlled by their relative v elocities; the velocities were governed by mutual gr a vitational perturbations, which were in turn controlled by the mass distribution.

Sagan, Carl Edward (1934–96) American astronomer known for his Solar System studies, especially of planetary a tmospheres and surfaces, and investigations into life and its origin on Earth. After working at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory he moved to Cornell in 1968, becoming director of its Laboratory for Planetary Studies and professor of astronomy and space science. In the early 1960s he showed that, since a greenhouse effect should be operating on VENUS , its surface temperature could be as high as 800 K. In 1963 Sagan and colleagues at NASA repeated the Miller–Urey experiment ( see Harold UREY ) using a different set-up and mixture of gases, and showed that not only amino acids but also sugars and ATP – the chemical used by cells to store energy – could have formed in the primordial atmosphere of the Earth. Sagan’s interest in the possibility of LIFE IN THE UNI - VERSE involved him in SETI studies and led to his co- authorship of Iosif SHKLOVSKII ’s Intelligent Life in the Universe (1966). He also helped to compose messages carried on board the VOYA GER and some of the PIONEER probes that could convey information about humans and the Earth to any intelligent entity that might eventually find them. From the 1970s, Sagan was a successful popu- larizer of astronomy, with books on planetary science and other areas, including evolution, as well as the TV series Cosmos . In 1997, the year after his death, the MARS PA THFINDER lander was named the Carl Sagan Memorial Station in his honour. Sagitta See feature article Sagittarius See feature article Sagittarius A (Sgr A) Complex centre of our Galaxy, and the most intense part of the Milky Way’s radio emission. The actual centre is marked by a smaller radio source, Sgr A*, less than 4 AU across, pin-pointed using the Very Long Baseline Array of radio telescopes. Sgr A* may mark the presence of a massive BLACK HOLE . Very close to Sgr A* is an intense infrared source (IRS 16), which is a large cluster of newly formed hot B stars. In addition to the radio and infrared emission from the region, X-rays and gamma-rays have also been detected. Detailed maps of Sgr A in radio emission, mostly made by the VERY LARGE ARRAY , show remarkable struc- tures, loops, arcs and a series of narrow parallel filaments at r ight angles to the plane of the Milky Way, which radi- a te by the SYNCHROTRON mechanism. The filaments may indicate the presence of a strong magnetic field, but they could also be created by winds. Within 3 l.y. of the centre is a theta-shaped pattern. The ring of the theta is made of gas that has probably piled up there as a result of some outflow from the centre; alternatively it may be the tat- tered remnant of one or more nebulae that were shredded by moving in the gravitational pull of the central stars. The bar of the theta, also gaseous, is surprisingly hot and apparently has a different origin. There is a thin streamer of gas that may link the shell of material around the puta- tive black hole with the nearest gas cloud. Sgr A remains a ve ry mysterious object.

Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy Disrupted companion to our GALAXY , discovered by detailed star counts and distance estimates.

Saha, Meghnad (1894–1956) Indian nuclear physicist and astrophysicist who derived the formula ( SAHA ’ SEQUA - TION ) linking the degree of ionization in a gas to tempera- ture and electron pressure that is vital to the interpretation of stellar spectra. He confirmed his theory of thermal ion- ization (1920) by studying the solar chromosphere and spectra of stars, especially novae. Saha equation Equation, formulated by the Indian physicist Meghnad Saha (1893–1956), that determines how the relative number densities of the various levels of ionization (including the neutral atom) of an element change with temperature. It takes the form: where the subscript I or I \u0001 1 denotes the level of ionization, N is the number density, U is an atomic constant called the partition function, m e is the electron mass, k is BOLTZMANN ’ S CONSTANT , T is the temperature, h is PLANCK ’ S CONSTANT and \u0002 I is the energy required to ionize the I th ion to the ( I \u0001 1)th ion.

Sakurai’s object V4334 in Sagittarius; the central object in a PLANETARY NEBULA discovered by the Japanese amateur astronomer Yukio Sakurai in 1996 February. He observed a rapid brightening of the 11th-magnitude object, which remained bright for about two years before dimming in mid-1998. The star had probably experienced a late HELIUM FLASH in 1994. The planetary nebula has since been observed to be expanding at a rate of 31 km/s (19 mi/s). It has an apparent angular diameter of 44 \u0003 . Sakurai’s object is the third late helium flash star to be observed. The first was V605 Aql, which brightened and faded during 1919 to 1923, and the second was FG SAGITTAE , which reached its maximum brightness in 1970 and faded in 1992. It is presumed to have experi- enced its helium flash at the beginning of the 19th centu- ry. See also SHELL BURNING Salpeter process See TRIPLE - \u0004 PROCESS Sandage, Allan Rex (1926– ) American astronomer who made the first optical identification of a quasar and for many years has worked to establish the distance scale of the Universe and a low value of the HUBBLE CONSTANT . Since 1952 Sandage has worked at the Mount Wilson and P alomar Observatories, initially as assistant to Edwin Hubble. In 1960 he and Thomas Arnold Matthews (1927– ) used Palomar’s 200-inch (5-m) HALE TELESCOPE to identify a faint, star-like object in the same position as the radio source 3C 48 listed in the THIRD CAMBRIDGE CAT - ALOGUE ; three years later, Maarten SCHMIDT found the immense redshift in the spectrum of the object, which turned out to be a quasar. In 1965 Sandage found the first radio-quiet quasar. Sandage also worked on the COSMOLOGICAL DISTANCE SCALE , calibrating the various ‘standard candles’ in order to establish the distances of galaxies. With Martin SCHWARZSCHILD , he studied the evolution of globular clusters in order to determine their ages. The ages of their oldest stars were not compatible with a relatively young, small Universe, as favoured by Gerard DE VAUCOULEURS . In 1976 Sandage and Gustav Andreas Tammann (1932– ) gave a value for the Hubble constant of H 0 =5 0 km/s/Mpc, half that given by De Vaucouleurs. In 1979 Sandage proposed that one of the main tasks of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) should be to strive towards fixing the value of H 0 . Since its launch, Sandage and others have used the HST to examine CEPHEID VARI - ABLES and supernovae in distant galaxies, deriving in the late 1990s a value of H 0 = 60 km/s/Mpc. Saiph The star k Orionis, visual mag. 2.07, distance 722 l.y., spectral type B0.5 Ia.

Salpeter, Edwin Ernest (1924– ) Austrian-American astrophysicist, who emigrated first to Australia, then to England and the USA, and specialized in stellar evolution. He spent most of his career at Cornell University, where he worked with Hans BETHE applying relativity theory to a tomic physics. He was the first to explain how highly evolved stars convert hydrogen to helium to carbon by the triple- \u0004 reaction (known also as the Salpeter reaction). By relating the observed abundances of stars of various lumi- nosities to his models of stellar evolution, Salpeter was able to derive the initial mass function (known also as the Salpeter function), which predicts the rate at which these stars will form in the Milky Way based upon their masses. SALT Abbreviation of SOUTHERN AFRICAN LARGE TELE - SCOPE Salyut space stations Name given to seven Soviet SPACE STATIONS . Two different design bureaux were involved in their development, and each bureau produced its own versions in 1971–76, one series for ‘civilian’ use (Salyuts 1, 2 and 4) and another ‘military’ version known as ‘Almaz’ (Salyuts 3 and 5). Both versions weighed about 18.5 tonnes. Crews of two or three cosmonauts were ferried up to Salyut by the SOYUZ spacecraft. The first five Salyuts were equipped with only one docking port. Commencing with Salyut 6, a second docking port was made available. This allowed automatic Progress and heavy Cosmos ferry craft to carry supplies and fuel to the stations, and enabled semi-permanent occupation of the stations by long-dura- tion crews. The last of the series, Salyut 7, re-entered the a tmosphere in 1991 February.

SAO Abbreviation of SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY and of SPECIAL ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY SARA Abbreviation of SOCIETY OF AMATEUR RADIO ASTRONOMERS satellite Smaller body orbiting a larger one. At the most massive end of the scale, this can be taken to refer to small galaxies orbiting a larger primary as, for example, M32 and NGC 205 in relation to the Andromeda Galaxy. Likewise, in this sense, planets are satellites of their star, though they are rarely spoken of in this way. Instead, the term is most commonly applied to a body in orbit about a planet. Every planet in the Solar System, except Mercury and Venus, has at least one natural satellite (as opposed to ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE ) in orbit about it. The discovery of planetary satellites was important because measurement of the period and dimensions of a satellite’s orbit enables the mass of its planet (or, strictly, the combined mass of planet and satellite) to be determined. Written without a capital ‘M’, the term ‘moon’ is syn- onymous with ‘natural satellite’, whereas the Moon is the name of the Earth’s only such satellite. The MOON and the Earth have been companions since the final stages of the Earth’s formation, 4.5 billion years ago, and the Moon is believed to have formed from the debris of a giant colli- sion ( see GIANT IMPACTOR THEORY ). A similar process could account for the origin of Pluto’s only known satel- lite, CHARON , which is the most massive satellite relative to its planet. In contrast Mars has two small irregularly shaped satellites, PHOBOS and DEIMOS , which are asteroids captured by Mars probably within the past billion years. Each of the four GIANT PLANETS has an extensive satellite system. At the outer fringes of the planetary RING system are small, bright, icy moonlets in circular orbits; they may be fragments of larger satellites destroyed by collisions or tidal forces. Slightly nearer the planet come several satellites, such as Jupiter’s GALILEAN SATELLITES , that are large enough (greater than about 400 km/250 mi in diameter) for their own gravity to pull them into a spheroidal shape. These too are in virtually circular orbits and are believed to have grown by A CCRE - TION within circumplanetary disks while the planets were forming. This far from the Sun, the SOLAR NEBULA was cold enough to allow the direct condensation of ice, so the large satellites are mostly icy bodies with deeply bu r ied rocky interiors. At Jupiter, the ice is composed just of water, but with increasing distance from the Sun more volatile species are present, such as methane, ammonia and nitrogen. Neptune, exceptionally, has only one large satellite, TRITON . It is in a RETROGRADE orbit and is presumed to be a captured EDGEWORTH – KUIPER BELT object. Any family of large satellites previously possessed by Neptune is likely to have been lost during the capture process. Tw o of Saturn’s large satellites, TETHYS and DIONE , are accompanied in their orbits by small (less than 30 km/20 mi in diameter) irregularly shaped satellites that occupy stable LAGRANGIAN POINTS and bear the same geometric and dynamic relation to them as do the TROJAN ASTEROIDS to Jupiter. Beyond their large satellites, the g iant planets have numerous smaller satellites, mostly in inclined, eccentric, and in some cases retrograde, orbits. These satellites are dark irregular objects, possibly coated by carbonaceous material, and are probably captured asteroids or comet nuclei. TIDAL FRICTION has caused the rotation period of most satellites to become synchronous with their orbital period, so that like our own Moon they always keep the same face towards their planet ( see SYNCHRONOUS ROTATION ). Slow- ing down of a large, originally rapidly spinning satellite in this way could cause considerable internal TIDAL HEATING , which would have allowed internal DIFFERENTIATION to take place, with the formation of a rocky CORE (and possi- bly an iron-rich inner core) beneath an icy MANTLE . Tides are also important in causing satellite orbital ECCENTRICI - TY to decrease until, in the absence of other perturbations, the orbit would become circular. However, the large satel- lites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus are massive enough to have a significant gravitational influence on one another. The orbits of adjacent satellites have often evolved into a state of orbital RESONANCE , meaning for example that one satellite has twice the orbital period of the next. When in a state of orbital resonance, the influence of other satellites prevents an orbit from becoming exactly circular. At times the varying forces on the TIDAL BULGES raised on a large satellite by its planet may then be suffi- cient to act as a significant source of tidal heating, leading to volcanism and/or fracturing of the surface. This activity occurs at the present time within Jupiter’s satellites IO and EUROPA , and it clearly affected several other large satellites in the past. Without tidal heating, satellites would simply have ancient surfaces heavily scarred by a 4-billion-year history of impact cratering. One of the greatest revelations of the VOYA GER missions, which were the first to explore the satellites of the outer planets in any detail, was the amazing variety of landscapes they possess. Some asteroids are now known to have their own tiny satellites. The first, named DA CTYL ,w as discovered on images of the asteroid IDA sent back by the GALILEO space- craft in 1993. The second, an object 18 km (11 mi) across, was discovered telescopically in orbit around the asteroid EUGENIA (diameter 215 km/134 mi) in 1998. satellite laser ranger (SLR) Specialized telescope that uses time-of-flight measurements of short pulses of laser light to determine the distances to satellites in Earth orbit. The principle is the same as that of radar, except that light, rather than radio waves, is used. Pulses of laser light are beamed from the telescope at dedicated satellites covered in retro-reflectors. These work like ‘cat’s eyes’ and reflect the light back in the direction from which it came. By timing how long it takes the light to travel to and from the satellite, the distance can be computed to an accuracy of a few cen- timetres. Because the satellites are in very stable and well- known orbits, the results provide information about the rotation of the Earth, the geometry and deformation of its surface, and variations in its gravitational field. SLR stations are located all over the globe and the results from each one make it possible to measure very accurately the distance between points on the Earth’s sur- face, making it a good technique for studying plate tecton- ics. Satellite laser rangers have replaced the PHOTOGRAPHIC ZENITH TUBE (PZT) as the primary means of measuring variations in the Earth’s rotation. Saturn Sixth planet in the Solar System and the second largest; it was the most distant planet known to man before the development of the telescope. The telescopic appearance of the planet is dominated by the majestic sys- tem of rings, which were probably first seen by Galileo in 1610, even though he did not recognize their nature (he believed Saturn to be a triple planet). The rings lie in the plane of the planet’s equator and are tilted by 27º with respect to its orbit. Consequently, the faces of the rings will be alternately inclined towards the Sun and then the Earth by up to 27º. At intervals of approximately 15 years, the rings become edge on to the Earth and are virtually invisible to the observer. This situation occurred in 1995–96. The rings are extremely reflective, so that they can add significantly to the total brightness of the planet. The distance from one edge of the rings to the other is more than 275,000 km (171,000 mi), which is nearly 353 S S AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:21 pm Page 353"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"three-quarters the distance of the Earth to the Moon. Sat- urn is now known to have at least 30 satellites. Saturn is composed of hydrogen and helium, but they are not in solar proportions. There is a helium depletion in Saturn where the mass fraction is only 11%, compared with the solar abundance of 27%. This significant differ- ence, when compared with JUPITER ,m ay be due to the differing internal structures and current stages of evolu- tion of the two planets. It is thought that the internal temperatures are too low for helium to be uniformly mixed with hydrogen throughout the deep interior. Instead, the helium may be condensing at the top of this region, where the gravitational energy is then turned into heat. This process may have started 2000 million years ago when the temperatures first dropped to the helium condensation point. For Jupiter, this situation can only have been reached recently. The other primary con- stituents of the atmosphere are ammonia, methane, acetylene, ethane, phosphine and water vapour. Saturn has a similar visible appearance to Jupiter, with alternating light and dark cloud bands, known as zones and belts, respectively. Saturn’s clouds are more subtle and yellowish and, therefore, less colourful than those found on Jupiter. Contrast is also muted by an overlying haze layer. Consequently, the cloud features and associat- ed spots, although varied in nature and colour, are less prominent on Saturn. Several stable ovals of various colours (white, brown and red) have been observed in Saturn’s atmosphere. The white clouds are composed of ammonia particles, and the other colours are generated through dynamical and photochemical actions and reac- tions in the atmosphere. Three brown spots, situated at 42ºN during the VOYA GER encounters, were seen to behave in a similar fashion to the Jovian white ovals. The largest features seen were a reddish cloud 10,000 \u0001 6000 km (6000 \u0001 4000 mi) at 72ºN and a red spot 5000 \u0001 3000 km (3000 \u0001 2000 mi) at 55ºS. These features demonstrate the non-uniqueness of the Jovian Great Red Spot (GRS) and other cloud ovals. A major characteristic of the Saturnian mid-latitude weather systems is a jet stream, which produces alternate high- and low-pressure systems in the same way as the terrestrial phenomenon. Anti-cyclonically rotating cloud systems, like the Jovian GRS and trains of vortices, familiar in the Earth’s atmos- phere, are also seen. The Saturnian weather systems, like those of Jupiter, are strongly zonal. At the equator the cloud top winds reach 500 m/s (1600 ft/s), which is equiv- alent to three-quarters of the speed of sound at this level. Although Saturn has a strong internal heat source, the we a ther systems of Saturn (and of Jupiter and the Earth) are driven by the transport of energy from small-scale fea- tures into the main zonal flow. Probably the most dramatic cloud features witnessed in the Saturnian atmosphere are the Great White Spots, which break out at roughly 30-year intervals coincident with the planet’s northern hemisphere midsummer, as in 1876, 1903, 1933, 1960 and 1990. The interior of Saturn is thought to consist of an Earth-sized iron-rich core of ammonia, methane and wa ter, which is enclosed by about 21,000 km (13,000 mi) of liquid metallic hydrogen, above which extends the liq- uid molecular hydrogen and the extensive cloud layers. It is in the metallic hydrogen region that the magnetic field is created by the dynamo action from the rapidly rotating Saturn 354 S \u0001 Saturn The Hubble Space T elescope’s STIS (Space T elescope Imaging Spectrograph) instrument imaged Saturn’s aurorare in 1994.

The first detection of the Saturnian magnetic field w as made from the PIONEER 11 spacecraft in 1979. At the cloud tops the equatorial field has a strength of 0.21 G, compared with the Earth’s value of 0.31 G. The magnetic axis is within 1º of the axis of rotation; it is therefore the least tilted field in the Solar System. The MAGNETOSPHERE of Saturn is intermediate between those of the Earth and Jupiter in terms of both extent and population of the trapped charged particles. The average distance of the BOW SHOCK is 1.8 million km (1.1 million mi), while the MAGNETOPAUSE itself lies much closer to the planet, at 500,000 km (300,000 mi). These distances are, of course, extremely variable, since their precise positions will depend on the temporal behaviour of the SOLAR WIND . The largest satellite, TITAN , is situated near the magnetopause boundary and regularly crosses this division. The magnetosphere is divided into several definite regions. At about 400,000 km (250,000 mi) there is a torus of ionized hydrogen and oxygen atoms; the plas- ma’s ions and electrons spiral up and down the magnetic field lines, contributing to the local field. Beyond the inner torus, there is a region of plasma, extending out to 1 mil- lion km (600,000 mi), produced by material coming part- ly from Saturn’s outer atmosphere and partly from Titan. The magnetotail has a diameter of about 80 R S (Saturnian radii). There is a strong interaction between the charged particle environment and the embedded satellites and r ings that surround Saturn. All these bodies absorb the charged particles and have the effect of sweeping a clear path through the region where they are located. There is also auroral activity in the polar regions, where the charged particles cascade into the upper atmosphere. The Saturnian aurorae are about two to five times brighter than the equivalent terrestrial phenomena. Saturn is a powerful radio source, emitting broad band emissions in the ran ge from about 20 KHz to about 355 S \u0001 Saturn Most of Saturn’s satellites orbit the planet directly, but the outer satellites Iapetus and Phoebe have r etrograde orbits and are in a different plane from the others, which may imply that they are captured asteroids. \u0002 Saturn The rapid changes in Saturn’s atmosphere can be seen in this pair of Voyager 2 images taken just over ten hours apart.

The maximum intensity occurs between 100 and 500 KHz with a period of 10 h 39 m .4, which corresponds to the System III rotation period. The IONOSPHERE , resid- ing above the neutral mesosphere, contains mainly ionized h ydrogen, which is strongly controlled by the solar wind. The interaction between the charged particle envi- ronment and the rings is unique at Saturn, where radial features or spokes have been seen in the B RING . These features are confined to the central portion of the B ring and appear to correspond to a location where only small, micrometre-size particles are present. The ring particles become electrically charged and appear as a torus above the plane of the rings. Each spoke, which is generally w edge-shaped and about 6000 km (3700 mi) long, has a lifetime of a few planetary rotations. The detection of electrostatic discharges (lightning) at radio wavelengths suggests that this mechanism is related to the formation of the spokes. Saturn Nebula (NGC 7009) PLANETARY NEBULA in w estern Aquarius (RA 21 h 04 m .2 dec. \u0001 11º22 \u0002 ). At an estimated distance of 160 l.y., it is one of the closest to our Solar System. Discovered by William HERSCHEL in 1782, the Saturn Nebula takes its popular name – given by Lord Rosse in the 1850s – from the extensions, or ansae, seen to either side, which give it a resemblance to Saturn when its rings are presented close to edge-on.

Saturn rocket Rocket developed by NASA in the early 1960s for manned spaceflight. The Saturn V, the largest, most powerful rocket ever built, was used for the APOLLO missions to the Moon. Its thirteenth and last flight was to insert the SKYLAB space station into Earth orbit in 1973. The final Saturn IB launch took place in 1975 during the Apollo–Soyuz Test Programme. saros Cycle of 18 years 10.3 days after which the Sun, Moon and the NODES of the Moon’s orbit return to almost the same relative positions. It is a result of the REGRESSION OF THE NODES . The saros was known to the ancient Babylonian astronomers; it was used to predict eclipses, since any eclipse is usually followed by a similar one 18 years 10.3 days later. Slight variations from cycle to cycle mean that the eclipses are not identical. For example, the total SOLAR ECLIPSE of 1999 August 11 was potentially visible along a track from south-west England to France, Germany, Turkey, Iran and India: the next one in the cycle, on 2017 August 21, will be visible from the United States. scale height Increase in height over which a physical quantity, for example atmospheric density or pressure, declines by a factor of e ( e = 2.71828). For example, at an altitude of one scale height, the density of an at mosphere is 1/ e (= 0.37) of the value at its base. In the case of the Earth’s troposphere, the scale height is approximately 8.5 km (5.3 mi). scarp Steep slope of some extent along the margin of a plateau, terrace or bench. Linear scarps on planets and satellites often represent the surface expression of FAULTS ; sinuous scarps are usually the result of fluvial (water, lava) erosion. The inner slopes of volcanic craters and calderas are often scarps. In planetary nomenclature, such features are identified by the term Rupes. scattering Deflection of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION by particles. Where the particles are very much larger than the wavelength, scattering consists of a mixture of reflection and DIFFRACTION , and is largely independent of wa v elength. Where the particle sizes are very much smaller than the wavelength, the amount of scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength and so blue light is scattered about ten times more efficiently than red; this is known as RAYLEIGH SCATTERING . The blueness of the sky is due to Rayleigh scattering of sunlight by atoms and molecules in the a tmosphere. The setting sun appears red because far more blue than red light is scattered out of the line of sight and thus a greater proportion of red light penetrates to the observer. Scattering is described as elastic if no change in wavelength is produced, and inelastic if the wa v elength is increased or decreased by the encounter. Interstellar dust produces both scattering and ABSORPTION of starlight; the combined effect is known as EXTINCTION . The amount of extinction is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Scheat The star \u0005 P egasi, distance 199 l.y., one of the four stars that make up the SQUARE OF PEGASUS . It is a red g iant, spectral type M2 II or III, and varies irregularly between mags. 2.3 and 2.7. Its name comes from the Ara- bic saq , meaning ‘leg’. Scheiner, Christoph(er) (1575–1650) German Jesuit scholar and astronomer who, independently of GALILEO , discovered sunspots (1611). He initially tried to explain these spots, not as features on the Sun’s surface, which w ould imply that the Sun was ‘imperfect’, but as the shad- o ws of small intra-Mercurian planets. Galileo, who claimed that his own sunspot observations predated those of Scheiner, countered by showing that sunspots are fea- tures of the solar disk and do not move independently of it. Scheiner was the first to make systematic observations of sunspots (1611–25). Now acknowledging that sunspots move across the solar disk, he demonstrated from plots of their paths that the Sun’s axis of rotation is inclined by 7º 30 \u0002 to the ecliptic. He invented the first spe- cialized solar telescope, which he called a heliotropii telio- scopici , or ‘helioscope’. This telescope was significant for Saturn Nebula 356 S \u0001 Saturn rocket Many of NASA’s missions have been launched on Saturn rockets, including all of the Apollo trips to the Moon.

Schiaparelli, Giovanni Virginio (1835–1910) Italian astronomer whose mapping of Mars gave rise to the idea of Martian canals, and who discovered the relations between comets and meteor showers. Schiaparelli joined Brera Observatory in 1860, becoming director two years later and remained there for the rest of his working life. His studies of cometary tails in the 1860s, and his researches into previously observed comets, persuaded him that the particles that cause meteors are shed from cometary tails and follow elliptical or parabolic orbits around the Sun, identical with the orbits of comets. Schia- parelli originated the convention of naming showers after the constellation containing their radiant. In 1877 Brera acquired new equipment in time for the opposition of Mars that year. Schiaparelli prepared a map of the surface of Mars, introducing a nomenclature for the va r ious features that remained standard until the planet w as mapped by space probes. His adoption of Angelo SECCHI ’s term canali ( see CANALS , MARTIAN ), to describe v ague linear markings was the cause of much subsequent controversy; his reporting two years later of the apparent doubling of some canals (he called it ‘gemination’) further fuelled the debate over their origin. Schiaparelli prepared maps of Venus and Mercury, believing – mistakenly – that they had SYNCHRONOUS RO TA TION . He also made important studies of double stars, and discovered the asteroid (69) Hesperia. Schickard Ve ry much degraded lunar crater (44ºS 54ºW), 202 km (125 mi) in diameter, with rim components reaching 2800 m (9500 ft) above the floor. Because of foreshortening, this crater appears oblong, though its actual shape is more nearly circular. Long after its formation, Schickard was flooded by lunar basalts, g iving the floor a dark patchy appearance. Schlesinger, Frank (1871–1943) American astronomer who directed Allegheny Observatory, Pittsburgh (1905–20) and Yale University Observatory (1920–41). He used astrophotography to determine stellar parallaxes, supplanting the old visual methods. Schlesinger compiled several extensive ‘zone catalogues’ of precise positions and other data for more than 150,000 stars, and the first edi- tion of the BRIGHT STAR CATALOGUE . Schmidt, Bernhard Voldemar (1879–1935) Estonian optician of Swedish–German parentage who invented the SCHMIDT CAMERA . He made lenses and mirrors for several European observatories, including 300-mm (12-in.) and 600-mm (24-in.) mirrors for the University of Prague, and he refigured a 500-mm (20-in.) Steinheil objective later used by Ejnar Hertzsprung to measure very close double stars. In 1930 he made a telescope with a 440-mm (17 \u0001 \u0002 -in.) primary mirror and a 360-mm (14-in.) correc- tor plate which he figured while it was being deformed under vacuum – when the vacuum was released, the plate assumed the proper shape to eliminate coma and other aberrations of the primary mirror. Schmidt, Maarten (1929– ) Dutch-American astronomer, the first to realize the great distance of quasars when he identified highly redshifted lines in their unusual spectra. Schmidt left Leiden Observatory in 1959 for the CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY , and became director of the Hale Observatories (Mount Wil- son and Palomar) in 1978. F ollowing the discovery of the faint optical counterpart of the radio source 3C 48 in 1960 by Allan SANDAGE and Thomas Matthews (1927– ), it was found to have a curi- ous spectrum. These and similar objects, including 3 C 273, were named ‘quasi-stellar objects’, or QU ASARS . Schmidt showed that broad emission lines in the spectrum of 3C 273 were immensely redshifted, and that if this were a Doppler effect, the quasar had to be a billion light-years aw ay . Subsequently, all quasars were found to have highly redshifted spectra. By the late 1960s, enough quasars had been found for Schmidt to use them as a cosmological test for the then riv al BIG BANG and STEADY - STATE THEORIES . According to the latter, the large-scale structure of the Universe should be the same at all places and all times. However, the num- ber of quasars was found to increase with distance, sup- porting the Big Bang theory. Schmidt camera T ype of reflecting TELESCOPE incorpo- rating a spherical primary mirror and a specially shaped glass correcting plate to achieve a wide field of view com- bined with fast focal ratio. The conventional paraboloidal primary mirrors of reflecting telescopes only form a perfect point image as long as the incoming parallel light is exactly aligned with the axis. Departure from this causes steadily increasing degradation of the images due to coma, which is notice- able at ‘off-axis’ angles as small as a few arcminutes. The Schmidt camera, which was invented by Bernhard Schmidt in 1930, overcomes this problem by the use of a spherical rather than a paraboloidal, primary mirror. This eliminates the problem of coma but introduces SPHERICAL ABBERATION . To correct this, a thin glass plate, known as a ‘Schmidt corrector’ and with a very shallow profile w orked into one or both of its surfaces, is placed at the centre of curvature. The profile is complex in shape and has to be precisely computed to match and counteract the spherical aberration of the mirror, thus producing perfect images over a wide field of view. Because the image is formed on a curved surface, the photographic film or plate must be deformed by clamping it in a suitably shaped holder. Schmidt cameras are used photographically to record detailed images of very large areas of sky. This makes them ideal for observing extensive objects such as comets or certain nebulæ, or for recording large numbers of more compact sources, such as stars or distant galaxies, for sta- tistical studies. Perhaps their most important role is as sur- v ey telescopes used for identifying unusual or specific kinds of object, which can then be investigated in more detail with larger, conventional (narrow-field) instru- ments. Hybrid designs incorporating secondary mirrors (Schmidt–Cassegrains) or additional correctors ( BAKER – SCHMIDTS ) have also been developed.

Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit Upper limit on the mass of the helium core of a MAIN - SEQUENCE star. A star evolves off the main sequence when it has finished bu r ning hydrogen in its core. This occurs when the star has used about 10% of its total mass in hydrogen burning. The limit can be larger if electron degeneracy becomes important within the core; this can occur in lower-mass stars where the core has a higher density. The limit is named after Mario Schönberg (1916– ) and Subrahmanyan CHANDRASEKHAR . Schramm, David Norman (1945–97) American theo- retical astrophysicist who pursued links between particle physics, astrophysics and cosmology. In 1977 he was part of a team that constructed a model using the cosmic abundances of light elements to show that there could be no more than four families of elementary particles, a pre- diction confirmed in the late 1980s by particle accelerator experiments. Calculations he made suggested that the matter observable by telescopes accounts for only a small fraction of the Universe’s total substance – the rest must be some form of dark matter. Schramm developed cos- mological models that incorporated quarks to explain the Universe’s LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE . Schröter, Johann Hieronymus (1745–1816) German amateur astronomer and chief magistrate of Lilienthal, near Bremen, where he erected his observatory. Schröter’s 19- inch (480-mm) Newtonian reflector was for a time the largest in continental Europe. He made detailed observa- tions of the topographic features of the Moon and planets. His two-volume Selenographische Fragmente (1791, 1802) contained descriptions, drawings and height measurements for hundreds of lunar craters and mountains. His 1785 October observations of small, dark spots on Jupiter that soon vanished may have been the earliest record of a comet impacting that planet, predating the SHOEMAKER – LEVY 9 impacts by over two centuries. In 1787 he discovered the solar GRANULATION and also the ‘light bridge’ features of sunspot umbrae.

The valley begins in an elongated depression called the Cobra Head, which was probably the source vent for the basalts. Schwabe, (Samuel) Heinrich (1789–1875) German pharmacist and amateur astronomer who discovered (1843) the approximately 11-year solar cycle. In 1825 he began to search for an intra-Mercurian planet. He realized that he needed to keep a careful record of sunspots, as any planet crossing the solar disk would closely resemble one of these features. Acquiring a Fraunhofer refractor, he continued recording sunspots, and 17 years later he noticed a periodicity in their number. Schwabe’s 11-year c ycle was later confirmed by the discovery (1852) that the Sun’s magnetic field also varies over the same period. Schwabe made one of the earliest drawings of Jupiter’s GREAT RED SPOT (1831). Schwarzschild, Karl (1873–1916) German astronomer remembered chiefly for his theoretical work, especially for finding the first solution to the equations of Einstein’s general theory of relativity. In the five years leading up to World War I, Schwarzschild directed both Göttingen and Potsdam Observatories; in 1914 he v olunteered for military service, and died two years later of a skin disease contracted on the Eastern Front. Schwarzschild designed and improved a number of instruments and techniques for use in spectroscopy and astrophotography. He pioneered photometric methods for measuring stellar magnitudes, demonstrating that there is a difference (the COLOUR INDEX ) between a star’s magnitude measured from a photographic plate and the visually estimated value. He was one of the first, in the mid-1900s, to examine RADIATIVE TRANSFER in stars, showing that radiation and gr a vitation are in equilibrium. His most famous work was done in the final year of his life. As early as 1900, he had suggested that the geometry of space could be non- Euclidean. In 1916, shortly after the theory of general relativity was published, Schwarzschild worked out the first exact solution of Einstein’s field equations, from which he developed the concepts of what are now called the SCHWARZSCHILD RADIUS and the BLACK HOLE . His son, Martin SCHWARZSCHILD , became an astrophysicist. Schwarzschild, Martin (1912–97) German-American astrophysicist, the son of Karl SCHWARZSCHILD , who made major contributions to stellar structure and evolu- tion. After taking his doctoral degree at Göttingen Univer- sity (1935), he emigrated to the USA, joining Princeton in 1951 and remaining there for the rest of his life. He made detailed studies of the structure of the Sun and other near- by stars, comparing their masses, temperatures and other properties. Schwarzschild’s research placed upper and lower limits on the masses of the stars, demonstrating that objects smaller than 10 Jupiter masses lack sufficient mass to initiate hydrogen fusion, while stars of more than 65 solar masses are rare. He calculated Z He , the total mass density of elements heavier than helium, showing that this quantity varies with the age of a particular star. His work on stellar evolution mainly concerned ‘pulsation theory’, Schönberg–Chandrasekhar limit 358 S SCORPIUS ( GEN . SCORPII , ABBR .

Its brightest star, ANTARES (which marks the heart of the scorpion), is a red giant irregular variable (range 0.9–1.2) and close binary; its bluish-white companion, mag. 5.4, separation 2 \u0001 .9, appears pale green in comparison to its primary. Next brightest at mag. 1.6 is \u0002 Sco ( SHAULA ). \u0003 1 Sco (known as Acrab or Graffias) is a double star with bluish- white components, mags. 2.6 and 4.9, separation 13 \u0001 .9, while \u0004 Sco consists of two bluish-white stars, mags. 4.1 and 6.8, separation 41 \u0001 , each of which has a fainter, close companion. U Sco is a recurrent nova which is usually around 18th magni- tude but which flared up to 9th magnitude in 1863, 1906, 1936 and 1979.

Schwarzschild radius Radius that a body must exceed if light from its surface is to reach an outside observer. If an object collapses below this radius, its escape velocity r ises to above the speed of light and the object becomes a BLACK HOLE . For a black hole, the Schwarzschild radius is equal to the radius of the EVENT HORIZON . The Schwarzschild radius is proportional to the mass of a body. For a non-rotating body of mass M and no charge, the Schwarzschild radius, R s , equals 2 GM / c 2 , where G is the gravitational constant and c is the speed of light.

This property allows QU ASARS and radio stars to be distinguished from RADIO GALAXIES and nebulae. Stars and planets can be distinguished from each other because Earth’s atmospheric variations cause the point-like stars to twinkle and the planets (that have a visible disk) to remain steady; a similar twinkling occurs with radio sources but from a different cause. Radio waves are refracted by the plasma clouds that move outwards from the Sun through the Solar System. The point-like radio sources are affected by the clouds, and so scintillate. This means the sources are either intrinsically very small, or very distant (and so appear small). The scintillation method was used to discover quasars, with the 4.5-acre radio telescope in Cambridge. To see the twinkling it was necessary to make the radio receiver respond very quickly to changes in radio intensity. This made it possible for Jocelyn BELL to discover PULSARS during the course of the scintillation measurements. scintillation T winkling of stars and, to a lesser extent, of planets as a result of the uneven refraction of light in areas of different density in the Earth’s atmosphere. To the naked eye, scintillation appears as a change in brightness and colour, while in the telescope it may also make the star appear to make rapid slight movements. It is greatest at low altitudes, when the object’s light shines through a greater amount of the atmosphere. Most of the effect is caused below 9000 m (30,000 ft). The planets twinkle less than stars because they present small disks rather than points of light and the whole disk is unlikely to be affected simultaneously. In a telescope, however, the disk will appear blurred; this effect is usually referred to as bad SEEING . Scintillation depends on the we a ther, and is usually greatest at about noon. Modern observatories are sited where the effect occurs least.

Originally a proponent of the STEADY - STATE THEORY of cosmology, Sciama re-focused his research towards Einstein–de Sitter models of a BIG BANG universe when observational evidence showed that the former theory was seriously flawed.

Scorpius X-1 First cosmic X-ray source to be discovered (in 1962), and the brightest known apart from certain X - RAY TRANSIENTS . It is a low-mass X - RAY BINARY with an orbital period of 19.2 hours. One member is a NEUTRON STAR and the other member is unknown, except that it has an ULTRAVIOLET EXCESS and optical flaring, and it supplies material to the A CCRETION DISK around the neutron star. Scotch mount Simple camera mount, based in two boards joined by a hinge, that can be driven by hand or a small motor to follow the stars’ sidereal motion, allowing moderate-length wide-angle exposures without trailing. The hinge is aligned to the celestial pole. By turning a screw of known pitch at a defined rate, the upper board – to which the camera is attached – can be turned on the hinge away from the lower to mimic the westwards track- ing of an EQUATORIAL MOUNTING . For exposures up to about 20 minutes, this gives satisfactory non-trailed star images. The mount takes its name from the Scottish roots of George Youngson Haig (1928– ) who designed and popularized it in the early 1970s; it is also sometimes known as the Haig mount , while American amateurs know it as the barn-door mount .

Seares, Frederick Hanley (1873–1964) American astronomer who standardized the stellar magnitude sys- tem and successfully mapped the Milky Way’s structure. After directing the Laws Observatory of the University of Missouri (1901–09), he joined the staff of Mount Wilson Observatory, where he spent the remainder of his career (1909–45). In 1922, the IAU adopted his NORTH POLAR SEQUENCE of fundamental stellar magnitudes as the basis of its photographic and photovisual systems of stellar pho- tometry. Collaborating with Frank E. R OSS , Seares com- piled an extremely accurate catalogue of 2271 northern circumpolar stars brighter than 9th magnitude. In his many research projects, he often collaborated with his wife, Mary (Cross) Joyner Seares . season Pa rt of a cyclical variation in the climatic conditions on the surface of a planetary body over the course of a single revolution around the Sun, brought about by the inclination of the body’s axis of rotation to the plane of its orbit. The Earth’s axis of rotation is inclined at 23º27 \u0001 so that, during the course of a year, the northern and south- ern hemispheres alternately receive longer or shorter peri- ods of daylight. When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it experiences summer, while the south- ern hemisphere experiences winter. Six months later, when the Earth is on the other side of its orbit around the Sun, the situation is reversed; the southern hemisphere enjoying summer whilst it is winter in the north. Between the two extremes lie spring and autumn. The beginning and end of each season is defined by the position of the Sun with respect to the ecliptic. At the time of the VERNAL EQUINOX , on March 21, it is said to be the first day of spring in the northern hemisphere. Spring lasts until the SUMMER SOLSTICE on June 21, which, although marking the longest day, is deemed to be the first day of summer. The end of summer and the start of autumn is marked by the A UTUMNAL EQUINOX on Sep- tember 23, with the WINTER SOLSTICE on 22 December, the shortest day, defining the end of autumn and the beginning of winter. These seasons are reversed for the southern hemisphere. Mars, the rotational axis of which is inclined at 25º11 \u0001 , also displays seasonal variations, particularly to its POLAR CAPS . On Neptune’s moon Triton, the polar cap migrates from pole to pole during the course of the planet’s 165- y ear orbital period. Secchi, (Pietro) Angelo (1818–78) Italian Jesuit astronomer, director of the Collegio Romano Observatory (1849–78) and a pioneer of solar physics and stellar spec- troscopy. Although forced to take refuge at Georgetown (Washington, D.C.) Observatory in 1847, when the Jesuits w ere driven into exile, Secchi spent most of his career at the Collegio Romano. His observations of 10th-magnitude stars shining through the tail of Biela’s Comet (1852) led him to conclude that cometary tails were gaseous, not solid. Secchi was one of the first (1859) to compile a com- plete photographic lunar atlas. He organized several expe- ditions to view solar eclipses and another, to Maddapur, India, to observe the 1874 transit of Venus. Secchi proved that PROMINENCES , which he classified as quiescent or eruptive, were a physical part of the Sun, and he was the first to describe SPICULES . Simultaneously with William HUGGINS , Secchi was the first astronomer to make systematic observations of stellar spectra. From his analysis of the characteristics of the spectra of over 4000 stars, Secchi devised the first spectral classification scheme, which formed the basis of the system developed by Edward C. PICKERING and his staff at Harvard. secondary (mirror) Small mirror in a REFLECTING TELE - SCOPE that diverts the converging beam of light from the PRIMARY towards the EYEPIECE . secondary body Any of the smaller members of a system of celestial bodies that orbit around the largest, the primary body. The planets are secondary bodies in their orbits around the Sun, but each planet is the primary body when considering its own satellite system, in which the satellites are the secondary bodies. secondary crater CRATER formed by the impact of pieces of EJECTA from a primary impact crater. Secondary craters are typically shallower than primary ones. They are abundant on bodies that lack an atmosphere. In rare cases, however, secondary craters have been observed even on Venus, the very dense atmosphere of which usually brakes the ejecta flight. Secondary craters are typically between one and two orders of magnitude smaller than the primary. They form radial and concentric chains and clusters around the primary crater. second contact Moment during a SOLAR ECLIPSE when the leading (easterly) limb of the Moon appears to touch the easterly limb of the Sun. During a TOTAL ECLIPSE , this marks the arrival of TO T ALITY . Second contact in a LUNAR ECLIPSE defines the moment when the Moon’s trailing (westerly) limb enters Earth’s UMBRA ; in a total lunar eclipse, this is the time when totality begins. second of arc (symbol \u0002 ) Unit of angular measure also known as an arcsecond; it is equivalent to 1/60 of a MINUTE OF ARC and 1/360 of a degree. The unit is widely used in astronomy, particularly as a measure of angular separation or diameter of celestial bodies. The RESOLVING POWER of a telescope is also usually expressed in arcseconds. SDSS 360 S 64-2108 \u0001 season Because the Earth’s axis is inclined relative to its plane of orbit, the Earth experiences seasons.

For example, in the Earth–Moon system, frictional effects in the TIDES raised on the Earth by the Moon cause a slight lag in the Earth’s response to the tidal force, with the result that the TIDAL BULGE does not lie precisely along the Earth–Moon line. The resulting slight asymmetry in the gr a vitational attraction between the Earth and Moon causes a transfer of angular momentum and energy from the Earth’s rotation into the Moon’s orbit. This slows the Earth’s rotation, increasing the length of the day by 0.000014 seconds a year, and causes the Moon to recede at about 3.8 cm (1.5 in.) a year. A similar effect occurs for the Martian satellite Phobos, but because it is below SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT height, it is spiralling into the planet instead of receding. The radius of Phobos’ orbit is decreasing by about 1.9 cm/yr (0.7 in./yr) and it is expected that it will enter the R OCHE LIMIT and break up in about 38 million years time. See also TIDAL EVOLUTION secular parallax Angular displacement of a celestial body over time caused by the Sun’s motion through space relative to the LOCAL STANDARD OF REST . Secular parallax provides us with a method of measuring the distance to nearby groups of stars. Relative to nearby stars, the Sun is travelling at around 20 km/s (12 mi/s) in the direction of the constellation Hercules. The apparent displacement of a star arising from this solar motion is called its parallactic motion and by measuring the parallactic motion of a homogeneous group of stars, it is possible to obtain the secular parallax of the group. This method has been applied to estimate the average distances of groups of variable stars, such as RR LYRAE and CEPHEIDS , which are beyond the range of TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX . secular variable Star that is suspected to have increased or decreased markedly and presumably permanently since ancient times. Thus PTOLEMY and other early observers ranked MEGREZ ( \u0001 Ursae Majoris) as the equal of the other stars in the Plough pattern, whereas it is now obviously fainter; DENEBOLA , in Leo, was ranked of the first magnitude, but is now below the second, and so on. On the other hand RASALHAGUE ( \u0002 Ophiuchi) was given as magnitude 3 and is now 2. On the whole it seems very unlikely that any of these changes are real: more probably they are errors of observation or – even more plausibly – translation or interpretation. segmented mirror Ve ry large telescope mirror made up of a number of smaller mirrors that fit together to form one continuous optical surface. A segmented mirror offers the advantages of being much thinner and lighter in weight than a solid mirror of the same size. The 10-metre prima- ry mirrors of the twin Keck telescopes on Hawaii are each made up of 36 hexagonal pieces, each about two metres in diameter. During observing, a computer-controlled sys- tem of sensors and actuators adjusts the position of each segment relative to its neighbours to an accuracy of four nanometres. See also A CTIVE OPTICS ; SPIN CASTING seeing Effect of the Earth’s atmosphere on the quality of images produced by optical telescopes. The term is also used to express the quality of observing conditions and is usually expressed in arcseconds ( \u0003 ). It corresponds to the angular diameter of a star image produced at the focal plane of a telescope; the smaller that image is the better. Seeing refers to the spatial effect on the image and should not be confused with transparency, which is a measure of how much (or how little) the atmosphere a ttenuates the light. Ironically, clear nights when the stars are bright can suffer from poor seeing, and the seeing can be very good on nights when the stars are dimmed by slightly hazy conditions. Meaningful comparisons of seeing measurements can only be made when consistent methods of defining and measuring the diameter of the star image are used. Seeing also varies with time, so the timescale over which mea- surements are made is also significant. Where important decisions rely on consistent seeing measurements, such as choosing a site for an observatory, differential image motion monitoring is often used. Two or more images of the same star are formed by parallel paths through a single telescope, and the relative motion of these images is converted into an assessment of the see- ing. Prior to quantitative measurements of seeing the ANTONIADI SCALE w as used. The effect of seeing is caused by light passing through air of differing temperature and therefore differing refractive index. These differences are mostly due to air masses mixing in the upper TROPOSPHERE , but the local effect of heat sources in the telescope building and heat r ising from the surrounding ground can be significant. Astronomers go to great lengths to choose sites with good inherent seeing, where the airflow is smooth with little turbulent mixing above the site. Increasingly, they pay g reat attention to the design of telescope buildings to minimize their effect on seeing. On world-class sites ‘good seeing’ would be better than half an arcsecond, whereas one-arcsecond seeing would be considered very good on a site in the United Kingdom. Av oiding atmospheric seeing is one of the main reasons for placing optical telescopes such the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE into orbit. The detail revealed in Hubble pic- tures clearly illustrates what can be achieved when seeing is removed and the quality of the image depends only on the size and quality of the optics. seismology Study of the shockwaves produced by earthquakes and other disturbances, such as meteoritic impacts and explosions, that propagate through planetary bodies. The strength and characteristics of the waves are measured by instruments called seismographs. The principal types are P (pressure) and S (shear) waves, which travel through rock at different speeds, depending on its density and mechanical properties. Measurements of such waves provide information on the internal structure of a planet, such as its division into CRUST , MANTLE and CORE .

There are various subtypes. Some (designated SRA) differ little from MIRA STARS except in having amplitudes less than 2.5 mag., but the shapes of their light-curves vary. Other stars (subtype SRB) show a definite periodicity, interrupted at times by irregularities, or intervals of constant light. A small subtype (SRC) comprises supergiants of late spectral type with amplitudes of no more than 1 magnitude and periods from 30 to several thousand days. MU CEPHEI is an interesting example of this subtype. There are also stars classified as semiregulars but with earlier spectral types (F, G and K), sometimes with emission lines. These have been assigned to subtype SRD.

See also CALIBAN SETI Acronym for Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, the umbrella term for all endeavours, especially those using radio telescopes, to find signs of intelligent life else- where in the Universe. SETI assumes that life exists on some EXTRASOLAR PLANETS ; a small percentage of that life is sufficiently advanced to have developed civilizations and technological capabilities; such civilizations are either unintentionally emitting or deliberately transmitting sig- nals that are detectable across intervening space; and such signals if received will be identifiably of artificial origin. Almost 50 years of SETI research has produced no evi- dence for extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI). A vast number of stars must first be checked for the presence of suitable planetary systems, very few of which will contain planets potentially suitable for complex life, and very few of those may be expected to host technologi- cally advanced civilizations. Natural cosmic radio sources produce ‘noise’ spread across a wide frequency range. Radio SETI experiments look for narrowband signals, with a frequency spread of just a few hertz, characteristic of a purpose-built transmitter – these are the easiest sig- nals to detect as their energy is concentrated in a small region of the radio spectrum. The earliest serious attempt to detect ETI signals was Project Ozma (the name is from Frank Baum’s The Wizard of Oz ). In 1960 Frank DRAKE and others used a 26-m (85-ft) antenna at Green Bank to search at the 21- cm hydrogen line. Ozma was unsuccessful and was aban- doned after a few months. Since then a number of other projects, mostly privately funded, have scanned the heav- ens in various regions of the radio spectrum. Project Phoenix targets 1000 carefully selected stars within 200 l.y. of the Sun. A 28 million channel receiver provides high sensitivity to weak signals. Observations began at Parkes, NSW, Australia in 1995 February, and at Green Bank in 1996 September; observations are also made for two 3-week sessions each year at Arecibo. By mid- 1999, Phoenix had examined about half its targeted stars. semidetached binary 362 S SERPENS ( GEN . SERPENTIS , ABBR .

A 1971 report from NASA’s Ames Research Center proposed an array of between 1000 and 2500 100-m (330-ft) antennae to synthesize a single 10-km (6-mi) diameter dish to search for ETI signals from up to 1000 l.y. away. Project Cyclops , as this was called, w ould have cost about $20 billion at 2001 prices and the project was stillborn, but the idea of an integrated multi- dish array has resurfaced in the ALLEN TELESCOPE ARRAY (ATA). Its ability to scan many areas of the sky at once, with more channels than in previous searches and for 24 hours a day, will give the ATA a much greater capability than Project Phoenix. Analysis of the vast amounts of data generated in SETI research has low priority on large astronomical comput- ers. The UC Berkeley SETI team realized if a large num- ber of small computers – PCs – could work simultaneously on different parts of the analysis, the job could be done in a relatively short time. By mid-2001, the SETI@home project had 3.5 million computers in homes, offices, schools and colleges linked to the Berkeley through the Internet and processing data during idle time. Until recently, SETI was restricted to radio astronomy techniques. However, optical SETI (OSETI) aims to detect pulsed lasers, infrared messages or other artificial optical signals. Theoretical studies began in the early 1960s, since when developments in optical technology have made OSETI capable of detecting ET signals. Charles Townes (1915– ) suggested in 1962 that extrater- restrial civilizations might use lasers for interstellar com- munication, for which the directionality of laser beams makes them ideal. He calculated that a 10-kW laser direct- ed through a 5-m (200-in.) space telescope would appear brighter than the Sun, and would therefore be detectable by an ETI on a target planet, using a similar telescope, 100 l.y. away. Attempts to search for such signals using small telescopes and fast photon counters are already under way, and more sensitive searches are planned. Seven Sisters See PLEIADES Sextans See feature article sextant Astronomical instrument containing a 60º arc (from Latin sextans , meaning one-sixth of a circle). In the 1570s Tycho BRAHE developed large wooden sextants of 1.8 m (6 ft) radius mounted on a ball joint, whereby two astronomers working together could measure horizontal or right ascension angles between pairs of stars, for celestial map-making. The term ‘sextant’, however, is more commonly used nowadays to describe a precision hand-held instrument used by navigators for measuring celestial angles. The modern navigator’s sextant is based on the original 1731 design by John Hadley (1682–1743) in which the observation of a stellar image reflected from a small built-in mirror doubles the instrument’s amplitude from 60º to 120º; it replaced the mariner’s ASTROLABE . Eighteenth-century precision engineering, as embodied in the dividing engine made in 1775 by Jesse Ramsden (1735–1800), soon brought the sextant to technical maturity, enabling it to be used to find the longitude at sea from the position of the Moon. Seyfert, Carl Keenan (1911–60) American astronomer best known for his investigations of what are now known as SEYFERT GALAXIES . He spent his career at McDonald Observatory (1936–40), Mount Wilson Observatory (1940–46) and Vanderbilt University (1946–60). He studied the spectra and distribution of stars in the Milky Wa y and developed new equipment and techniques for photoelectric photometry and wide-field astronomical photography. His most famous research, published in 1943, concerned galaxies with inconspicuous spiral arms and very bright nuclei, the class of active galaxy now named after him. Seyfert galaxy Class of A CTIVE GALACTIC NUCLEUS , defined as showing a starlike nucleus and EMISSION LINES that are of high ionization and large velocity width. The class was first recognized by Carl SEYFERT . When examined carefully, about 5% of bright galaxies have Seyfert nuclei, which are found mostly in spirals of early type (Hubble classes S0, Sa, Sb). There are two subtypes: type 1, in which the broad BALMER LINES of h ydrogen are much broader than other emission lines, spanning thousands of km/s; and type 2 in which all emission-line widths are comparable (usually a thousand km/s or less). Type 1 Seyferts have spectra very much like QU ASARS . As in the case of quasars and RADIO GALAXIES , there is a unified model in which type 2 Seyfert nuclei are type I objects seen through an obscuring torus. This model is supported in many cases by polarization measurements and by the detection of cones of highly ionized material to each side of the (sometimes invisible) nucleus itself. These cones are not generally well aligned with the galaxy’s overall rotation axis. Some Seyferts show small-scale radio structure resembling distorted JETS , although their interstellar gas seems to prevent the jets from propagating very far. Like quasars, Seyfert nuclei are variable, and the response of the surrounding gas to changes in the core brightness has been used to map the size and structure of the gas seen in emission lines. Much of the gas seen in the broad emission lines must be situated only a light-day or so from the core. This small size combined with the large linewidths, indicating that a very deep gravitational field is needed to keep the gas from escaping, are points giving r ise to the popular picture of a massive BLACK HOLE pow- ering Seyfert galaxies. The best-known Seyfert galaxies are M77 (NGC 1068), the prototype for type 2, and NGC 4151, the stan- dard type 1. Such galaxies as M81 also show weak Seyfert activity when examined closely. shadow bands Phenomenon seen immediately before and after totality at a total SOLAR ECLIPSE , consisting of rapidly moving ripples of light and dark passing over the g round. Attempts to photograph them have failed, but these shadow bands have been recorded on video when seen crossing a white screen. It is believed that they result 363 S SEXTANS ( GEN . SEXTANTIS , ABBR .

It was named Sextans Uraniae (Urania’s Sextant) by Johannes Hevelius in 1687 to commemorate the astronomical instrument. Its brightest star, \u0001 Sex, is mag. 4.5. The brightest deep-sky object in Sextans is the Spindle Galaxy (NGC 3115), a 9th-magnitude lenticular galaxy. \u0001 Seyfert galaxy M77 (NGC 1068) is the prototype type 2 Seyfert galaxy. It has equally broad hydrogen emission and forbidden lines in its spectrum, indicating that there is high- velocity gas in its inner regions. V isually, Seyfert galaxies are characterized by their bright, small nuclei.

Observers who witnessed a strong display of shadow bands at the 1998 F ebruary total solar eclipse in the Caribbean likened the effect to the play of sunlight on the bottom of a water- filled swimming pool. Shakerley, Jeremy (1626– c .1655) English astronomer. By 1649 he had discovered the writings of the recently deceased Jeremiah HORROCKS , William GASCOIGNE and William CRABTREE , and was a fervent supporter of the Copernican system. Between 1649 and 1653 he published three books attacking astrology. He clearly considered Horrocks his scientific role model, and his Anatomy of Urania Practica (1649) was the first occasion that Hor- rocks’ work was acknowledged in print. Shakerley was making telescopic observations of comets and eclipses after 1650, and of the 1651 transit of Mercury. Shapley, Harlow (1885–1972) American astronomer who first defined the nature and extent of the Milky Way galaxy. His early years were spent at Mount Wilson Observatory (1914–21), where he became the first (1918) accurately to measure the distances to globular clusters, by calibrating Henrietta LEAVITT ’s period–lumi- nosity law for Cepheid and RR Lyrae variable stars in the clusters. The globular clusters are concentrated near the central bulge of the Milky Way, so these studies enabled Shapley to identify a region in Sagittarius at galactic longitude 325º as the galactic centre. He calcu- lated its distance as 50,000 l.y., which, though about 60% g reater than the distance obtained if the effects of inter- stellar reddening are taken into account, still implied that the Galaxy was much larger than previously thought. Shapley defended his idea of a large ‘metagalaxy’ in the famous 1920 GREAT DEBATE with Heber Curtis. From 1921 to 1951 Shapley directed HARVARD COL - LEGE OBSERVATORY , modernizing the facilities and equip- ment and establishing the BOYDEN OBSERVATORY in South Africa. Shapley catalogued many thousands of galaxies beyond the Milky Way, publishing, with Ade- laide Ames (1900–1932), the first comprehensive cata- logue of these objects – A Survey of the External Galaxies Brighter Than the Thirteenth Magnitude (1932). He was one of the first to recognize that galaxies are not distrib- uted uniformly in the Universe, but arranged in groups and clusters. In 1938 Shapley discovered the Fornax and Sculptor dwarf galaxies. Shaula The star \u0001 Scorpii, visual mag. 1.62, distance 703 l.y., spectral type B1.5 IV. It lies in the tail of the scor- pion, and its name is the Arabic word for ‘stinger’. Shedir The star \u0002 Cassiopeiae, visual mag. 2.24, distance 229 l.y., spectral type K0 III. Small telescopes show a wide, unrelated companion of mag. 8.9. Its name, which is also spelled Schedar or Schedar , comes from the Arabic sadr , meaning ‘breast’. Sheliak Name of the star BETA LYRAE . shell burning Nuclear burning of elements in thin spherical shells in the atmosphere of stars. Shell burning occurs when nuclear FUSION has been exhausted in the core, whereupon the core collapses producing thermal energy, which raises the temperature of the material surrounding the core sufficiently for nuclear fusion to occur there. The shell burning gradually moves outwards, causing the star to expand, until all the nuclear fuel has been exhausted in the envelope. Hydrogen shell burning occurs in stars as they evolve off the MAIN SEQUENCE to become RED GIANTS . More massive stars will burn other elements in their cores and have other episodes of shell burning. See also STELLAR EVOLUTION shell galaxy ELLIPTICAL GALAXY that shows faint, thin shells of stars on either side of the nucleus. Attention was first called to these galaxies in 1979, when the photographic image-enhancement techniques of David Malin (1941– ) showed these subtle features. They appear to result when a DISK GALAXY merges with an elliptical, and the coherent stellar motions from the disk lead to its stars wrapping across the centre of the elliptical, producing narrow shells where they reverse direction. As many as 28 concentric shells have been seen in a single galaxy. Related shell-like features have also been found in S0 and a few Sa galaxies, and their occurrence has been used as evidence of advanced mergers or galactic CANNIBALISM . shell star MAIN - SEQUENCE star that is surrounded by a shell of gas, generally of spectral type Be. Examples are \u0003 Cassiopeiae, BU Tauri and 48 Librae. The spectrum of a shell star typically shows a rapidly rotating underlying B star, with broad absorption lines superposed with emission lines and additional sharp absorption features. The star is rotating rapidly, losing mass to an expanding shell that is pulled into a disk around the equator. The sharp absorption features are caused by the disk. Be-shell stars are believed to be the same as ‘classical’ BE STARS viewed along the equator. Other Be stars are in CLOSE BINARY systems, with the material surrounding them being accreted from their companion stars. Herbig Be objects are believed to be a more massive version of TTA URI stars. Shen Gua (or Guo or Kua) ( c .1031– c .1095) Chinese civil and military administrator, mathematician and astronomer. He devised a model of the Solar System using new mathematical techniques to explain the plan- ets’ retrograde movements, and developed a theory of the Moon’s complex orbit; his ability to predict celestial events ingratiated him with the emperor’s government. Shen designed and built astronomical instruments, including an improved GNOMON and a highly accurate ARMILLARY SPHERE . His other major achievement was to reform the calendar. Shen Zhou Chinese 8-tonne spacecraft, which, in about 2003–2004, should carry the first Chinese astronauts into orbit.

He was selected in 1959 as one of the original Mercury astronauts, and on 1961 May 5 he piloted the Freedom 7 spacecraft to an altitude of 188 km (117 mi) before returning to Earth.

Often found in pairs, the shepherd moons share the orbit of the particles in the ring system, an example being PROMETHEUS and P ANDORA , which stabilize Saturn’s F RING . The moon closer to Saturn moves slightly faster, having the effect of speeding up any particles which stray, while the outer moon moves more slowly and drags any stray particles back into the ring. Two shepherd moons, CORDELIA and OPHELIA , are found in the Uranian system, situated on either side of the planet’s Epsilon ring. Shergotty METEORITE that fell in Bihar, India, in 1865 August; a single stone of approximately 5 kg was recovered. Shergotty is the type specimen for the Shergottites, one of the main subdivisions of MARTIAN METEORITES (SNCs). Shergottites are subdivided into the basaltic and lherzolitic shergottites. The former are fine- g rained pyroxene–plagioclase rocks, which formed as flows at or close to the Martian surface. The latter are more coarse-grained olivine–pyroxene plutonic rocks. Shklovskii, Iosif Samuilovich (1916–85) Ukrainian astrophysicist who in 1953 explained that the continuum radio and X-ray emission from the Crab Nebula was SYN - CHROTRON RADIATION and correctly predicted that OH w ould radiate at microwave frequencies. He discovered many X-ray binary systems, and improved the calculation of distances to the planetary nebulae associated with white dwarfs. Shklovskii also showed that the temperature of the solar corona is about 1 million K, and how magnetic fields outline its structure. He also was an early proponent of SETI studies, and his Intelligent Life in the Universe (1966), co-written with Carl SAGAN , is a classic text. shock Important process in many branches of astronomy and space science. Though the simple shock produced by a supersonic aircraft is familiar, the processes involved in astrophysical shocks are less well understood. The general description of a shock is that there is some boundary, the shock surface, and that as matter crosses the boundary there is a rather sudden change in the state of the matter. This change is an irreversible change in thermodynamic terms. The usual form of shock is that there is conversion of kinetic or flow energy into random thermal energy. The temperature is higher on one side of the shock. Examples of shocks are found in the SOLAR WIND , including the BOW SHOCK caused by planetary MAGNETOS - PHERES . Shocks are also probably involved in solar FLARES . In the interstellar medium, for the clouds of gas and dust that form the region between the stars as well as the more spectacular nebulae, shocks form important boundaries. They are thought to be involved in various early stages of star formation from these clouds and are certainly involved in the late stages of STELLAR EVOLUTION such as SUPERNOVAE . On a larger scale it is thought that shock processes occur in RADIO GALAXIES . Shoemaker, Eugene Merle (1928–97) American geol- ogist and astronomer who extended geological principles to the Moon and other bodies, advanced the impact theo- ry of cratering, and pioneered the study of NEAR - EARTH OBJECTS . In 1937 he joined the UNITED STATES GEOLOGI - CAL SURVEY (USGS), with which he remained associated until his death. In 1951 he married future collaborator, Carolyn (Jean) Spellmann Shoemaker (1929– ). The Shoemakers’ visit to METEOR CRATER the next year con- vinced Gene that terrestrial and lunar craters resulted from asteroidal impacts, which he followed up with a study of craters formed in the deserts of Nevada during US nuclear bomb tests. In the 1960s, Shoemaker organized the geological experiments on NASA’s manned and unmanned lunar missions, and in 1965 was appointed chief scientist of the USGS’s new Center of Astrogeology. In 1969 his interest turned from impact craters to the objects that produced them. Initially with Eleanor Helin and later with Carolyn Shoemaker, he began a search for near-Earth objects, using P ALOMAR OBSERVATORY ’s 0.46-m (18-in.) Schmidt telescope. The programme resulted in the discovery, from 1973, of many NEAR - EARTH ASTEROIDS and, from 1983, the first of many comets now bearing the Shoemaker name, the most famous of which was Comet SHOEMAK - ER – LEVY 9. It established Palomar as the leading discovery site for asteroids of all kinds. Shoemaker–Levy 9, Comet Comet discovered on 1993 March 25 by Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker and David Levy (1948– ) on a photographic patrol plate exposed at Mount Palomar, San Diego, USA.

Analysis of the comet’s motion showed it to be in a two-year orbit around Jupiter, into which it had probably been captured as long ago as 1929. At a close (21,000 km/13,000 mi) perijove in 1992 July, tidal stress had disrupted the comet’s fragile nucleus into at least 21 sub-kilometre-sized fragments. Calculations showed that these fragments would impact on to Jupiter over the course of the week of 1994 July 16–22. The fragments were named alphabetically in order of anticipated impact, and as they continued along their terminal orbit they became spread out into a ‘string of pearls’ imaged from ground-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope. Ahead of 1994 July, there w as much speculation as to what effect, if any, the impacts w ould have on the giant planet. Intensive observing programmes were established w orldwide. The impacts themselves occurred just beyond the jovian limb, out of sight from Earth (but visible from the Galileo spacecraft at that time en route to Jupiter). The planet’s rapid rotation would carry the impact sites into view from Earth within about an hour of each event. Observers were surprised by the scale and violence of the impacts. Cameras on Galileo revealed the entry fire- balls as bright flashes, and infrared observations from the terrestrial viewpoint showed huge plumes of material thrown high above the jovian cloud-decks following the impacts. The energies involved were most graphically shown by the easily visible Earth-sized dark spots that marked each impact site on Jupiter. Over the course of the week of the comet’s demise a series of dark impact scars peppered Jupiter’s clouds at 44ºS latitude, with impacts coming, on average, about seven hours apart. The impact scars remained visible for some weeks, even- tually merging into a new dark belt on Jupiter, persisting for the next 18 months. Searches through historical observations of Jupiter have produced only flimsy candidates for previous similar impacts during the telescopic era since the early 17th cen- tury. It has been suggested that such events may occur once in a thousand years. The Shoemaker–Levy 9 impacts again emphasized the fragility of comet nuclei (many of which appear to have been captured as distant, small satellites by both Jupiter and Saturn), and the catastrophic energy scales involved in cosmic collisions. shooting star P opular, non-scientific description of a METEOR . Short, James (1710–68) Scottish optician who worked in London, the first to give telescopic mirrors a true para- bolic figure. Short realized that a mirror having a parabol- ic, instead of a spherical, surface would be freer from spherical aberration. He also made the first successful telescope based on the design of Laurent Cassegrain (1629–93) ( see CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE ). This instru- ment, completed around 1740 and nicknamed ‘Dumpy’, had a diameter of 6 inches (150 mm) and a focal length of 24 inches (600 mm). short-period comet COMET for which the interval between successive perihelion returns is less than 200 y ears.

The SIDEREAL DAY , which lasts 23 h 56 m 4 s .091 of MEAN SOLAR TIME , is the time taken for the Earth to complete a single revolution on its axis, relative to the stars rather than to the Sun, which is the basis for a civil day. Astronomers use sidereal clocks, which run at a slightly different rate from conventional timepieces, to determine whether a celestial object can be observed at any given time. sidereal day Time interval between two successive transits across an observer’s meridian of the FIRST POINT OF ARIES or of any given star. The sidereal DAY is a measure of the period of rotation of the Earth, relative to the background stars, and is equivalent to 23 h 56 m 4 s .091 of MEAN SOLAR TIME . sidereal month Time taken for the Moon to complete a single revolution around the Earth, measured relative to a fixed star; it is equivalent to 27.32166 days of MEAN SOLAR TIME . See also ANOMALISTIC MONTH ; DRACONIC MONTH ; MONTH ; SYNODIC MONTH ; TROPICAL MONTH sidereal period Orbital period of a planet or other celes- tial body around its primary, as measured relative to the stellar background. The sidereal period of a planet pro- vides a true measure of its year as opposed to the SYNODIC PERIOD , which is a measure of the time taken for the body to complete a single orbit as observed from the Earth. sidereal time Time measured by the rotation of the Earth relative to the stars, rather than to the Sun. The Earth rotates on its axis once a DAY , at the same time moving in its orbit around the Sun, which it takes a YEAR to complete. This means that, relative to the stars, it completes one extra rotation during the course of a year, resulting in a SIDEREAL DAY being approximately 3 m 56 s shorter than a mean solar day ( see MEAN SOLAR TIME ). Sidereal time provides an indication as to whether a celestial object is observable at any given time, since objects cross the local meridian at a local sidereal time equal to their RIGHT ASCENSION . Astronomers therefore use clocks that show sidereal time and that run at a slightly different rate from ordinary clocks. The zero point for measuring sidereal time is the FIRST POINT OF ARIES , the position on the celestial sphere where the ecliptic crosses the celestial equator. When this transits the observer’s meridian, it is 0 h sidereal time. Sidereal and solar times coincide once a year near the VERNAL shooting star 366 S \u0001 short-period comet Most short-period comets are thought to have originated in the Edgeworth–Kuiper belt and to have been perturbed into the inner Solar System by the gravitational influence of the gas giants.

From here it can be directed towards instruments such as a SPECTROHELIOSCOPE . Unlike the similar HELIOSTAT , which is equatorially mounted, the mirror of the siderostat has to be driven about two axes simultaneously in order to follow the Sun across the sky. The benefit of this arrangement is that the beam is directed horizontally, rather than in a direc- tion parallel to the Earth’s rotation axis, allowing greater flexibility in the positioning of the fixed mirror. As in the heliostat, the final image slowly rotates. See also COELOSTAT Siding Spring Observatory Australia’s major optical observatory, 20 km (12 mi) west of Coonabarabran in New South Wales. The observatory is at an elevation of 1150 m (3770 ft) on Siding Spring Mountain, one of the higher ridges of the Warrumbungle Range. It was devel- oped in the early 1960s as an outstation of MOUNT STROMLO OBSERVATORY and remains the property of the Australian National University (ANU). The first group of telescopes had apertures of 0.41, 0.61 and 1.02 m (16, 24 and 40 in.). In 1984 the ANU added a 2.3-m (90-in.) telescope of advanced design known as the Advanced T echnology Telescope (ATT), which for the first time incorporated in a single instrument a thin mirror, an altaz- imuth mounting and a rotating building. The ANU also operates the 0.5-m (20-in.) Uppsala Schmidt Telescope on behalf of NASA for near-Earth object searches. Siding Spring also hosts facilities belonging to other organisations, including the two telescopes of the ANGLO - A USTRALIAN OBSERVATORY (the ANGLO - A USTRALIAN TELESCOPE and the UNITED KINGDOM SCHMIDT TELESCOPE , respectively the largest of their kind in Australia), the Automated Patrol Telescope of the University of New South Wales and the southern FA ULKES TELESCOPE . Siding Spring’s modest elevation and easterly location do not provide the best atmospheric stability, but it does enjoy particularly dark skies and it remains Australia’s premier site for optical astronomy. Sigma Octantis Closest naked-eye star to the south celestial pole, visual mag. 5.45, distance 270 l.y., spectral type F0 III. Currently it lies about 1º from the pole, and the distance is increasing due to precession. signal-to-noise ratio Measure of signal clarity. All mea- surements ( M ) are the sum of the signal ( S ) and noise ( N ), so when the signal-to-noise ratio ( R ) is calculated the noise must be removed from the measurement first (to gi ve the actual signal) before dividing by the noise: R = S / N =( M \u0001 N )/ N . If the background noise is very high, the signal is overwhelmed by it, and the signal-to- noise ratio is very low (much less than 1). Technology continually strives to lower the noise in the detector in order to raise the signal-to-noise ratio. Simms, William See COOKE , TROUGHTON & SIMMS singularity P oint in space or spacetime at which the current laws of physics make non-real predictions for the v alues of some quantities. Thus at the centre of a BLACK HOLE , the density, the force of gravity and the curvature of spacetime are all predicted to be infinite. It is likely that radical changes to the laws of physics or new laws will be required to deal correctly with singularities. This may however not be necessary if the idea of cosmic censorship holds. Cosmic censorship requires that all singularities be hidden from the rest of the Universe by EVENT HORIZONS . If correct, then the difficulties presented by a singularity will never have to be dealt with in the real world ( see also NAKED SINGULARITY ). It is possible that the Universe as a whole originated in a singularity at the start of the BIG BANG . Sinope One of JUPITER ’s outer moons, discovered in 1914 by Seth Nicholson (1891–1963). It is about 36 km (22 mi) in size. Sinope takes 758 days to orbit Jupiter, at an average distance of 23.94 million km (14.88 million mi), in an orbit of eccentricity 0.250. It has a path (inclination 158º) in common with other members of its g roup.

They are usually a few hundred metres to 1 km deep, 1 to 3 km (0.6–2 mi) wide and up to 100 km (60 mi) long. Their morphology and association with v olcanic plains and constructs suggests that they originated from thermal erosion by flowing lava.

Sirius The star \u0002 Canis Majoris, the brightest star in the sky, at visual mag. –1.44. At a distance of only 8.6 l.y., it is also one of the closest stars to us. Sirius is popularly known as the Dog Star, since it lies in the constellation of the greater dog. It is a main-sequence star of spectral type A0 with a luminosity 22 times that of the Sun. The HIPPARCOS satellite detected signs of variability, but the range and cause are unknown. Sirius has a spectrum that shows enhanced absorption lines due to heavy metals, and is classified as a metallic-line A star, or AM STAR . Accompanying it is a white dwarf known as Sirius B , discovered in 1862 by the American astronomer Alvan G. CLARK . Sirius B is of visual mag. 8.44 and has just 0.005% of the Sun’s luminosity. It orbits Sirius every 50 y ears but is too close to be seen separately with small telescopes. Sirius B was originally the more massive of the two stars and evolved more quickly, transferring some of its gas to Sirius A and hence giving rise to the unusual spectrum. The name Sirius comes from the Greek word seirios , meaning ‘scorching’. 367 S \u0001 Sirius Shown here are Sirius A and B viewed at X-ray wavelengths. Although Sirius A outshines it in visible light, Sirius B is far brighter at these low-energy wavelengths. This is because it is far hotter – its surface temperature is some 25,000 K. The spike pattern is an optical effect of the detector. Sirius A is not in fact hot enough to be seen at X-ray wavelengths and it is thought that some ultraviolet radiation from it leaked on to the detector to give the fainter component.

Working with Henry Norris R USSELL at Princeton University, she studied bina- ry star systems and the masses of their components. At Mount Wilson Observatory she made a detailed study of the solar spectrum. Later (1945–90), at the National Bureau of Standards and Naval Research Laboratory, Sit- terly did much to standardize the nomenclature of solar spectral lines and general spectral line multiplets, includ- ing data for the near-ultraviolet obtained by rocket- launched UV instruments.

Skjellerup–Maristany, Comet (C/1927 X1) Br ight long-period comet discovered by J ohn Francis Skjellerup (1875–1952) at Melbourne, Australia, on 1927 December 3, and independently by Maristany, at La Plata, Argentina, on December 6. At perihelion (0.18 AU) on December 18, the comet was visible in daylight only 5º from the Sun; peak brightness was estimated at magnitude \u0003 6. At the end of 1927 December, the comet was visible in dark skies, with a tail approaching 40º in length. The orbit is elliptical with a period of 36,500 years. Skylab First US SPACE STATION . Skylab was developed from the third stage of the SATURN V rocket. The 75-tonne station was launched into a near circular orbit 433 km (270 mi) above the Earth’s surface on 1973 May 14. Skylab consisted of four sections, the largest being the orbital workshop, 14.7 m (48 ft) long and 6.6 m (22 ft) in diameter. This section also contained the living quarters. An airlock module contained equipment for the control of the station and also the hatch for space walks. A multiple docking facility contained an Apollo docking port at one end and a second, rescue port. Six telescopes for monitor- ing the Sun were powered by a windmill-shaped array of four solar panels. Just after launch, the station’s micrometeorite shield deployed prematurely and broke away, destroying one solar panel and damaging the other. After being briefed on the damage, the first crew was launched on May 25 and, after some difficulties, managed to erect a sunshield and cut free the jammed solar panel. The astronauts Charles Conrad (1930–99), Joseph Kerwin (1932– ) and Paul Weitz (1932– ) returned to Earth on June 22, after a record stay of just over 28 days. In spite of the early technical problems, the Apollo Telescope Mount w as operated for 88% of the planned time, making almost 30,000 exposures. Nearly 10,000 images of the Earth were also obtained. On July 28, a second crew, comprising Alan Bean (1932– ), Owen Garriott (1930– ) and Jack Lousma (1936– ), was launched to the space station. The astro- nauts installed a new and more efficient sunshield and also installed a micrometeorite detector on the telescope mount truss. During the mission they took 25,000 pho- tographs of the Sun and studied in detail more than 100 FLARES , including a major disturbance on August 21. The crew also returned with 16,800 pictures for use in crop surveys, land-use planning and searches for natural resources. They returned to Earth on September 25 after 59.5 days in space, then a record. Gerald Carr (1932– ), Edward Gibson (1936– ) and William Pogue (1930– ) entered Skylab on November 16. They spent much of their time repairing and replacing failed equipment. Nevertheless, they spent nearly two and a half times longer than planned observing the Sun and Comet K OHOUTEK , and more than three times the allotted time on materials-processing experiments. They returned to Earth after a record 84 days on 1974 February 4. During the three missions over 120,000 photographs of the Sun were taken and 72 km (45 mi) of magnetic tape w ere used to record data from on-board experiments. Five y ears later, Skylab re-entered the atmosphere over the Indian Ocean, scattering some debris over Australia. For- tunately no one was injured. Slipher, Earl Carl (1883–1964) American planetary astronomer (younger brother of Vesto SLIPHER ) who spent virtually his entire career at LOWELL OBSERVATORY (1906–64). Slipher was noted for the huge number of high-quality photographs, especially of Mars, that he took ov er a 50-year period. He confirmed (1937) the blue clearing phenomenon, when the Martian atmosphere, normally opaque to blue and violet light, suddenly becomes transparent at those wavelengths, allowing sur- face features to be seen clearly. In 1954 Slipher discovered Mars’ ‘W-clouds’, which formed over the Tharsis region. Slipher was among the last of the leading planetary astronomers to hold to the belief that the CANALS of Mars w ere real physical features. Slipher, Vesto Melvin (1875–1969) American astronomer (elder brother of Earl SLIPHER ) who discov- ered the recession of the galaxies. He spent his entire career at LOWELL OBSERVATORY , which he directed from 1916 to 1952, and where he supervised Percival Lowell’s search for Pluto, discovered by Clyde T OMBAUGH in 1930. He used a large Brashear spectrograph attached to Low- ell’s 24-inch (0.61-m) Clark refractor accurately to mea- sure the rotation periods of Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. His spectrograms of Jupiter showed bands of methane and ammonia that were later confirmed by Rupert WILDT and others. Slipher became the first (1912) to recognize the red- shifts of lines in the spectrum of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) and 36 other galaxies, a discovery later used by Edwin HUBBLE to determine the scale of the Universe. Obtaining radial velocities for galaxies required very long exposures with the Lowell spectrograph – as long as 60 hours – and meticulous calibration of the equipment. He announced a radial velocity of 300 km/s for M31, a result that was initially met with disbelief, as it implied that this w as an ‘island universe’ far beyond the Milky Way ( see GREAT DEBATE ). Slipher discovered that other spiral galax- ies were receding at high speeds and that they rotated, too; in 1916 he announced a rotation rate for M31 and later determined similar rates for other galaxies. He also investigated the nature of the interstellar medi- um, being the first to confirm the existence of interstellar calcium and sodium atoms. Slipher discovered reflection nebulae, explaining their luminescence. Expecting that the bluish nebulosity around Merope and other stars of the Pleiades would show a spectrum similar to the Orion Neb- ula and other bright diffuse nebulae, Slipher instead found Sirrah 368 S S AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:22 pm Page 368"},{"pageNumber":378,"pageContent":"Smyth, Charles Piazzi that the Pleiades’ nebulosity had spectra corresponding to the hot, young stars in the cluster, and correctly surmised that the Merope Nebula must shine by reflected starlight. Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Large-scale SURVEY , the first to be made with purely electronic detectors, thus g iving unprecedented photometric quality in five colours. It began in 1998, aimed at covering one-quarter of the sky. Redshifts are also being measured, and it is hoped that the resulting REDSHIFT SURVEY will plot the distribution of galaxies in a volume of space over 30 times as large as in any previous survey. The SDSS has a dedicated 2.5-m (100-in.) reflector at APACHE POINT OBSERVATORY . It is named after Alfred Pritchard Sloan, Jr (1875–1966), whose foundation financed the project. slow motions Manual controls that allow movement of a telescope around the axes of its mounting and allow a celestial target to be followed.

An instrument on an ALTAZIMUTH MOUNTING will require controls for both altitude and azimuth. slow nova (NB) NOVA that takes at least 150 days to decline 3 magnitudes below maximum light.

SAS-2, launched in 1972, carried a gamma-ray telescope. This was followed in 1975 by SAS-3, which discovered a type of X-ray star known as a ‘rapid burster’. See also GAMMA - RAY ASTRONOMY Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Nubecula Minor) Small GALAXY that is the second nearest external galaxy to us. It is about 190,000 l.y. away and has about 2% of the mass of our GALAXY . It extends over about 3º of the sky within the constellation of Tucana (RA 01 h 05 m dec. \u0001 72º), where it is easily visible to the naked eye, appearing like a detached portion of the MILKY WAY . The SMC, along with the LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD (LMC), is named after Ferdinand Magellan, who observed them during his voyage around the world in 1519, but they were known before that date. It is an irregular galaxy with a HUBBLE CLASSIFICATION of Irr I. The SMC’s physical width is about 15,000 l.y., but it is highly elongated with the long axis along the line of sight. Its depth is therefore some 60,000 l.y. The curious, long, twisted structure that has been found for the galaxy (and that may in fact divide the cloud into two distinct portions) suggests that strong tidal forces have distorted the SMC. This may have occurred during a close passage some 200 million years ago between the SMC and our Galaxy. This same close passage may have produced the Magellanic Stream, one of the largest HIGH - VELOCITY CLOUDS known. Although the SMC contains less gas and dust than the LMC, like the latter it also contains many HII and star-forming regions. The SMC orbits our Galaxy roughly at right angles to the plane of the Milky Wa y, and it may at some time in the future be disrupted and captured by our Galaxy.

It moved from Washington, D.C. to Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1955 and established itself as a pioneering centre for astrophysics and space science. In 1973 its close ties with the HARVARD COLLEGE OBSERVATORY we re cement- ed by the creation of the HARVARD – SMITHSONIAN CENTER FOR ASTROPHYSICS (CfA), and the SAO became part of one of the largest and most diverse astrophysical institutions in the world.

Smoot, George Fitzgerald III (1945– ) American observational cosmologist who led the COSMIC BACK - GROUND EXPLORER (COBE) team that in 1992 discov- ered minute variations in the cosmic microwave background radiation. Working at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory since 1970, Smoot has designed and led several missions to map the afterglow of the Big Bang, using instruments known as Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMRs) designed to measure minute fluc- tuations in the cosmic microwave background. Three ultra-sensitive DMRs launched on COBE detected tem- perature variations of just \u0002 30 millionths of a degree. These findings, announced by Smoot’s team on 1992 April 23, also supported the theories of INFLATION and COLD DARK MATTER . Smyth, Charles Piazzi (1819–1900) Scottish astronomer, the second Astronomer Royal for Scotland (1846–88), whose 1856 expedition to Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, proved the value of high-altitude observa- tories. He was born in Naples, Italy, the son of noted British amateur astronomer William Henry SMYTH , and his middle name honours his father’s friend Giuseppe PIAZZI .

From this altitude, bad weather w as less of a problem than at sea level; and the thinner air resulted in better seeing, which enabled him to detect fine detail on the Moon and planets and to resolve very close double stars. This expedition also marked the beginnings of infrared astronomy, as Smyth was able to make delicate measurements of the Moon’s heat radiation that would normally have been absorbed by the lower levels of Earth’s a tmosphere, which are opaque to the infrared. Smyth, William Henry (1788–1865) English naval offi- cer, hydrographer and amateur astronomer, famous for his Cycle of Celestial Objects (1844). Inspired by his work assisting Giuseppe Piazzi in preparing a star catalogue, Smyth built a well-equipped private observatory at Bed- ford, near London, in 1830. Its main instrument was a 5.6-inch (142-mm) Tulley–Dollond refractor equipped with the first weighted clock drive designed by Richard Sheepshanks (1794–1855). Smyth published a decade of observations as the Cycle , which included as its second v olume The Bedford Catalogue , a listing of 850 double stars, star clusters and nebulae. This work, aimed princi- pally at amateur astronomers, was the first comprehen- sive guidebook to observing celestial objects beyond the Solar System.

By 1910 the Snow Tele- scope had been superseded by the 60-ft (18-m) and 150-ft (45-m) Solar Towers, which are still used for solar research.

SARA encourages the continual surveillance of wide areas of the sky in search of new or unusual radio emissions. It publishes a monthly J ournal ; the membership also includes professional radio astronomers. SOFIA Abbreviation of STRATOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY FOR INFRARED ASTRONOMY software, astronomical Modern professional astrono- my relies extensively on software – the programmed sequences of instructions that control modern digital computers. Astronomers use computers networked through the Internet and World Wide Web to plan obser- va tions. Some observatories use intelligent scheduling programs to determine when observations will be made. During an observation, a telescope is controlled by pro- g rams that correct for telescope deformation and keep the telescope tracking the target object ( see A CTIVE OPTICS , ADAPTIVE OPTICS ). The instrumentation generates elec- tronic data (perhaps passing it first through a processing sequence that removes any instrument-specific effects) in a standard format that can be handled by one of the stan- dard astronomical data reduction systems. If the observa- tion forms part of a large-scale survey, the data may be automatically processed to determine basic characteristics such as object type and redshift, and stored in an Internet- accessible DA T ABASE . The astronomer may wish to examine the data in detail, displaying it in different ways, experimenting with IMAGE PROCESSING techniques, probing for the secrets it contains. The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS), developed by astronomers to encode definitions of image data and the data themselves, is a platform-independent system now widely used for interchanging data between observatories that has also become widely used outside astronomy. Astronomical data reduction is a specialist process requiring specialist software, usually written by program- mers employed at observatories or other astronomical institutions such as universities. Telescope and instru- ment control software is generally even more specialized, since each instrument has its own particular characteris- tics, so the software is usually written by those building the instrument or telescope. The software required for a new instrument now often represents a significant frac- tion of the total cost. The main astronomical data reduction systems are NOAO’s Image Reduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF) and ESO’s Munich Image Data Analysis System (MIDAS) in the optical region, and NRAO’s Astronom- ical Image Processing System (AIPS, and its successor, AIPS++) in the radio region. These can be seen as soft- w are component frameworks, with a structure that allows new components to be added easily and provides most of the basic services (for example data file access, user interaction) that the new component needs. Data acquisition systems can be structured in the same way, although, being real-time systems, they are significantly more complex. Most major observatories have devel- oped their own data acquisition frameworks, but there are only a few such systems, notably the RO YA L GREEN - WICH OBSERVATORY ’s ADAM (Astronomical Data Acquisition Monitor) and its descendant, DRAMA, developed at the Anglo-Australian Observatory and first used on the Two-degree Field (2dF) project ( see ANGLO - A USTRALIAN TELESCOPE ). Astronomical software is not restricted to large research institutions. Commercial packages are available for ama- teur telescope control ( see DRIVE ; GO TO TELESCOPE ). Image-processing techniques previously used only by pro- fessionals are now available to amateur observers wishing to use their personal computers to enhance images obtained with CCD cameras or to eliminate the effects of LIGHT POLLUTION . ‘Virtual planetarium’ programs can bring the Universe to one’s home.

Nearly all of these comets were tiny, with nuclei perhaps only a few tens of metres in diameter. Very few SOHO comets have been observed to survive perihelion passage. One notable exception was C/1998 J1 (SOHO), discovered on 1998 May 3 as a magnitude 0 object in the coronagraphs’ field of view.

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) Part of the European Space Agency’s INTERNATIONAL SOLAR TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS programme, together with the CLUSTER programmes, contributing to an international effort involving many spacecraft from Europe, the USA, J apan and other countries. The Solar and Heliospheric Observatory is a 1.8-tonne spacecraft; it was launched by an Atlas booster in 1995 December. Its mission is to make continuous observations of the solar photosphere, corona and solar wind to investigate the processes that form and heat the CORONA , maintain it and give rise to the expanding SOLAR WIND . It is also investigating the internal structure of the Sun. It carries 11 instruments, including a range of spectrometers and particle analysers. SOHO is situated at the L 1 Lagrangian point between the Sun and the Earth (1.5 million km/0.9 million mi from the Earth), where it points to the Sun continuously, with the Earth behind the spacecraft. Solar Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX) NASA satellite launched in 1992 July to observe the activity of the Sun and to investigate the origin and transport of galactic cosmic rays. SAMPEX studies the changes in the effect of different geomagnetic influences on the spacecraft, allowing studies to be made of the ionization and composition of irregular, or anomalous, components of cosmic rays having the same properties irrespective of the direction from which they come. The craft also observes precipitating magnetospheric electrons that interact with the atmosphere and investigates the isotropic composition of particles originating in solar flares. Solar B J apanese-led international spacecraft, involving the USA and the UK, to be launched in 2005 to make detailed observations of the Sun. It will study the way in which magnetic fields emerge through different layers of the Sun’s atmosphere, creating the violent disturbances that affect the Earth. Solar B will be placed into a Sun- synchronous polar orbit around the Earth, in which the craft’s optical telescope, X-ray telescope and ultraviolet imaging spectrometer will remain in continuous sunlight for nine months each year. solar constant T otal amount of radiant solar energy reaching the top of the Earth’s atmosphere at a mean Sun–Earth distance of one ASTRONOMICAL UNIT . The mean value of the solar constant from 1978 to 1998 was 1366.2 \u0001 1.0 watts per square metre. Variations in the solar constant were first reliably determined in the 1980s when suitable instruments were placed aboard satellites such as the SOLAR MAXIMUM MISSION . The solar constant rises and falls in step with the SOLAR CYCLE , b ut with a total change of just 0.1% from 1978 to 1998. During the two cycle minima of this period, the mean va lue was 1365.6 watts/m 2 . SUNSPOTS crossing the visible solar disk briefly decrease the solar constant by a few tenths of one percent for a few days: such decreases are outweighed by the brightness increase due to FA CULAE and PLAGES at times of high solar activity. Observations of sunlike stars suggest that larger-scale va ri a tions can occur. A 0.25% reduction in the value of the solar constant is capable of explaining the estimated drop of about 0.5 K in global mean temperature during the MAUNDER MINIMUM . solar cycle Cyclical variation in solar activity with a period of about 11 years between maxima (or minima). The solar cycle is characterized by waxing and waning of va r ious forms of solar activity, such as A CTIVE REGIONS , CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS , FLARES , the SOLAR CONSTANT and SUNSPOTS . The rise to maximum activity is usually much more rapid than the subsequent decline. Over the course of an approximate 11-year cycle, sunspots vary both in number and latitude. The conven- tional onset for the start of a solar cycle is the time when the smoothed number of sunspots (the 12-month mov- ing average) has decreased to its minimum value. At the commencement of a new cycle sunspots erupt around latitudes of 40 degrees north and south. Sunspots and their associated active regions are found in belts or zones at both sides of the equator with latitudes that move clos- er to the equator over the course of the cycle, finishing at around 5 degrees north and south. This pattern can be demonstrated graphically as a BUTTERFLY DIAGRAM and is known as SPÖRER ’ SLAW . The magnetic polarity of sunspots varies over a 22-year cycle, described by Hale’s law. The leading (westernmost) spots of sunspot groups in the northern hemisphere generally share the same polarity, while the following (easternmost) spots have the opposite polarity. In the southern hemisphere, the lead- ing and following spots also exhibit opposite polarities, b ut their magnetic configuration is the reverse of that in the northern hemisphere. All of the spots’ magnetic polarities reverse each roughly 11-year solar activity c ycle, so the complete cycle of the solar magnetic field is around 22 years. Reversal of field polarity can occasion- ally happen earlier for one hemisphere than the other, meaning that there may be intervals of up to a year when northern and southern sunspots actually have the same magnetic configuration. The solar cycle may be maintained by a D YNAMO EFFECT , driven by differential rotation and convection. Longer-term variations, with periods of the order of a thousand years may also occur, and there have also been episodes such as the MAUNDER MINIMUM when the normal w orkings of the cycle appear to have been suspended. Observations of chromospheric activity in other stars sug- gests that similar activity cycles are typical of stars with convective zones. solar day Mean time interval between two successive noons.

It occurs when the Moon’s shadow falls on Earth; for this to happen the Moon must be in line between Sun and Earth. In fact, it is an OCCULTATION of the Sun by the Moon and the purist will call it an eclipse of the Earth, since an eclipse is by definition the passage of a celestial body through the shadow of another. A solar eclipse can occur only at new moon (when the Moon is in conjunction with the Sun), but not at every new moon because of the 5º.15 inclination of the Moon’s orbit to the plane of the ecliptic. An eclipse will result only when the new moon roughly coincides with a NODE (the intersection between the orbit of the Moon and the Earth). This coincidence need not be exact, an eclipse can occur up to 18.75 days before or after the alignment, thus creating the ‘eclipse season’. Two eclipses can occur in every eclipse season because the synodic month (29.5 days) is less than the eclipse season (37.5 days). The nodes shift gradually westwards along the ecliptic, so the Moon reaches the opposite node less than six months later and realignment with the original node takes place after 346.62 days, representing the ‘ ECLIPSE YEAR ’. Four solar eclipses can occur in one year, but since the calendar year is greater than the eclipse year a fifth eclipse is possible in one calendar year on rare occasions, and then only in January or December. The maximum of five solar eclipses will next happen again in 2206. At least two solar eclipses of some kind must occur every year. A LUNAR ECLIPSE precedes or follows a solar eclipse by about two weeks because the same conditions prevail for the Moon before or after that interval. It has been known since Babylonian times that the nodes regain their original positions after 18 years 10.3 days, the SAROS period. It lasts 223 synodic months (29.5306 \u0001 223 = 6585.32 days). This cycle closely cor- responds with 19 eclipse years (346.62 \u0001 19 = 6585.78 days), hence eclipses recur after such cycles and form series. The added 0.32 of a day of the Saros is responsible for the westwards shift of subsequent eclipses by one-third of the Earth’s circumference (120º longitude). They also shift 2º to 3º north or south due to the 0.46 day difference between 19 eclipse years and the saros. This eventually causes the series to end by passing one or the other pole. Each series comprises some 70 eclipses over a period of about 1262 years. The apparent sizes of Sun and Moon as seen from Earth are very similar, but subject to variation due to the elliptical orbits of the Earth and Moon. A total eclipse occurs when the Moon appears larger than the Sun and the shadow cone reaches the Earth. When the Moon is at its largest (at perigee) and the Sun at its smallest (Earth at aphelion) a long total eclipse occurs; the maximum dura- tion is 7 minutes 31 seconds, and this can happen only if the shadow cone reaches the Earth near the equator around local noon. An ANNULAR ECLIPSE results in the opposite situation, when the shadow cone fails to reach the Earth. A ring of Sun will surround the Moon at mid-eclipse. An annular- total eclipse occurs if the apparent size of Sun and Moon are the same; it will be annular along most of the path, but in the middle of the eclipse path the shadow cone will just reach the Earth and in this location a very short totality is seen. A PA RTIAL ECLIPSE results if only part of the Sun is occulted by the Moon. A partial eclipse is seen over a wide area on Earth where the Moon’s penumbra reaches the Earth’s surface. A total eclipse can be seen only on the narrow path caused by the shadow-cone sweeping over the Earth’s surface from west to east with a velocity of some 3200 km/hr (2000 mph), the maximum width of this path is 270 km (170 mi). An observer situated outside this path will see a partial eclipse. Va r ious phenomena can be seen at a total eclipse. The mystery of a total eclipse is enhanced because the uniniti- ated have no warning of the impending spectacle, since the Moon cannot be seen approaching the Sun: the partial phase passes unnoticed unless the observer knows to look for it. It is dangerous to look at the Sun at any time, espe- cially with optical aids. The only safe way to observe the partial phase is to project the image of the Sun on to a white surface. Only during totality is it perfectly safe to look directly at the occulted Sun and the CORONA . The eclipse begins when the east limb of the Moon appears in the same line of sight as the opposite limb of the Sun and seems to encroach upon the Sun. This is the FIRST CONTACT . This moment goes by quite unnoticed. The projected image of the Sun will show a small notch some 10 seconds after first contact, this increasing in size as the Moon travels across the face of the Sun during the next hour or so. The light reduction is imperceptible at first and the temperature drops very little until the last five minutes of the partial phase. Then the real drama begins: the sky becomes darker, often with an eerie greenish tinge, quite unlike the darkening caused by clouds.

At the same time curious moving ripples of dark and light bands appear on any white smooth surface – a strange atmospheric phenomenon known as SHADOW BANDS . During the last few seconds of the partial phase light fails rapidly, it becomes noticeably cooler, birds settle down to roost, some flower petals close, and the wind tends to drop. As the last rays of sunlight fade, a dramatic change of the scene occurs: darkness descends on the countryside. The last sliver of the Sun is broken up by the Moon’s irregular limb, forming BAILY ’ S BEADS , and as the last bead disappears SECOND CONTACT has occurred: totality has begun. The observing site on the path of total- ity is engulfed in darkness, illuminated only by the beauti- ful pearly white corona surrounding the pitch black Moon. The resulting brightness on the Earth’s surface va r ies from eclipse to eclipse; it is comparable to that of the full moon. In contrast to the slow progress of the par- tial phase, events around second contact progress with incredible rapidity. A few seconds after the disappearance of the last Baily’s bead the pink CHROMOSPHERE (shining in the light of HYDROGEN - ALPHA emission) becomes visible on the eastern edge of the Moon’s dark disk, only to be covered quickly as the Moon advances. PROMINENCES of various shapes and sizes are seen during totality as pink flame-like projections. Large prominences remain visible throughout totality, while smaller ones appear and disappear as the advancing Moon uncovers or covers them; initially, those on the eastern limb are best seen, while towards the end of totality, prominences on the western limb become uncov- ered. The corona is the most striking feature of the total eclipse. The bright inner corona contains elegantly shaped arches, loops and helmet-like structures tapering off into the fainter streamers of the outer corona for a distance of several solar diameters. These various forms are created by the solar magnetic field. The shape of the corona varies with the 11-year solar cycle. At solar minimum, the coro- na is drawn out into long equatorial streamers, extending to enormous distances east and west, whilst the poles are studded with shorter plume-like jets. At solar maximum, the corona surrounds the Sun more evenly, the whole cir- cumference of the Sun being surrounded by medium- sized streamers of intricate structure. It pays to take the eye off the features surrounding the Moon and look at the sky, where planets and bright stars can be seen with the now dark-adapted eyes. The sur- rounding landscape shows a 360º orange glow – similar to sunset – bordering the shadow of the Moon. Brightening at the Moon’s western limb heralds the end of totality. As THIRD CONTACT occurs, the first rays of sunlight from the brilliant photosphere, shining through a lunar valley, gives rise to the famous DIAMOND - RING EFFECT . The corona and the brightest planets may be dis- cernible to the still dark-adapted eyes for some 10–20 sec- onds, but the main spectacle is almost over. Events now happen in reverse: as the sky brightens one can see the shadow of the Moon receding towards the eastern hori- zon, and shadow bands reappear; the temperature gradu- ally rises, cocks crow as in the early morning, and day-time activity resumes again after the short interrup- tion. The projected image of the Sun shows the gradual uncovering of the solar disk by the advancing Moon. The partial phase lasts another hour or so until the last notch on the solar disk dwindles and finally disappears: the Moon has parted from the Sun: fourth contact has occurred and the eclipse is over. Much information can be gained at a total eclipse. The corona, the outer atmosphere of the Sun, can be studied both visually and spectroscopically only during a total or annular eclipse. However, Bernard LYOT ’s CORONAGRAPH creates an artificial eclipse and allows limited study of the inner corona from Earth. Spacecraft-borne coronagraphs have proven particularly useful. Prominences, also first seen during an eclipse, can now be studied in more detail with the spectroscope or the interference filter. Timing the four contacts is still important today. The results may show a slight discrepancy between observed and predicted times, due principally to perturbations of the lunar orbit and irregularities of Earth’s rotation. The FLASH SPECTRUM can be photographed at second and third contacts, when the dark absorption bands of the photosphere change to the bright EMISSION LINES of the lower chromosphere, thus giving information on the intensities of the various spectral lines. The shadow bands occur as a result of effects in Earth’s atmosphere, and have been successfully recorded using video equipment. Einstein’s theory of GENERAL RELATIVITY w as first test- ed during the total solar eclipse of 1919 May 29. Starlight w as proved to be deflected by the Sun’s gravitational field. Ionospheric studies found that the ultraviolet radiation cut-off during totality resulted in an alteration of the elec- trical conductivity of the upper atmosphere. solar interior Sun’s internal structure. It comprises three principal regions: a central CORE , above which is found the radiative zone, and finally the convective zone, from which material rises to the visible surface of the PHOTOSPHERE . All of the Sun’s energy is produced by NUCLEAR REAC - TIONS fusing hydrogen into helium in the dense high tem- perature core, which extends for about one quarter of the solar radius (174,000 km/108,000 mi) from the centre. The core accounts for only 1.6% of the Sun’s volume, but about half its mass. At its centre, the core has a tempera- ture of 15.6 million K and a density of 148,000 kg/m 3 . The radiative zone surrounds the core out to 71.3% of the Sun’s radius, 496,000 km (308,000 mi) from the solar centre. Core radiation, initially in the form of gamma rays, is continuously absorbed and re-emitted at lower tempera- tures (and longer wavelengths) as it travels out through the radiative zone. Recent computations indicate that it takes about 170,000 years, on average, for the radiation to wo rk its way out from the Sun’s core through the radiative zone to the convective zone. At the bottom of the convective zone, the temperature has become cool enough, at about one million K, to allow some heavy nuclei to capture electrons. Their light- absorbing ability (opacity) obstructs the outflowing radia- tion and causes the PLASMA to become hotter than it w ould otherwise be. Because of its low density, the hot plasma rises, carrying energy through the convective zone from bottom to top in about 10 days. On reaching the vis- ible solar disk, the hot material cools by radiating sunlight into space and then sinks back down to become reheated and rise again. These churning convection cells create a GRANULATION pattern in white-light images of the PHOTO - SPHERE , which marks the top of the convective zone. T urbulent motions in the convective zone excite sound wa v es that echo and resonate through the Sun. When these sound waves strike and rebound from the photos- 373 S \u0001 solar interior Not only does the Sun rotate faster at the equator than at the poles but also belts of plasma have been observed moving at different speeds. These belts drift down towards the equator during the solar cycle and, as sunspots appear to form on the boundaries, may be a major factor in the changes in the Sun’s magnetic field. There are also deeper currents within the convective zone, which travel from the equator towards the pole. S AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:22 pm Page 373"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"phere, they cause the gas there to rise and fall with a peri- od of about five minutes. Observations of these oscilla- tions with instruments on the SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY ( SOHO ), and from the GLOBAL OSCILLATION NETWORK GROUP ( GONG ), have been used to examine sound waves with different paths inside the Sun, deter- mining its internal structure and dynamics with the tech- niques of HELIOSEISMOLOGY . The dominant factor affecting each sound is its speed, which in turn depends on the temperature and composi- tion of the solar regions through which it passes. The sound waves move faster through higher-temperature gas. Helioseismologists determine the difference between the observed sound speed and that calculated from the STANDARD MODEL of solar structure. Relatively small dif- ferences between the theoretical calculations and the observed sound speed are used to fine-tune the model and establish the Sun’s radial variation in temperature, density and composition. A small but definite change in sound speed has been detected at the lower boundary of the convective zone, pin- pointing its radius. After suitable refinements to the Stan- dard Solar Model, the measured and predicted sound v elocities do not differ from each other by more than 0.2%, from 0.95 solar radii down to 0.05 radii from the centre. This places the central temperature of the Sun very close to the 15.6 million K of the model, confirming predictions of the expected amounts of SOLAR NEUTRINOS . Measurements of sound wave frequencies to infer rotational and other motions inside the Sun have shown that the DIFFERENTIAL ROTATION , discovered by observa- tions of SUNSPOTS , persists to just below the convective zone. The equatorial regions in this zone spin rapidly, while the regions near the poles rotate with slower speed. At deeper levels the rotation rate remains independent of latitude, becoming uniform from pole to equator to pole. The Sun’s magnetism is probably generated at the inter- face between the deep interior, which rotates at one speed, and the overlying gas, which spins faster in the equatorial middle. Relative motions between neighbour- ing layers of electrified gas at this deep level probably help to amplify and generate the Sun’s magnetic field by the D YNAMO EFFECT . Material in the Sun’s interior flows in ways other than rotation. Broad zonal bands sweep around the equatorial regions at different speeds. The velocity of the faster zonal flows is about 5 m/s (16 ft/s) higher than gases to either side, but this difference is about 400 times slower than the mean velocity of rotation. A single zonal band is more than 65,000 km (40,000 mi) wide and 20,000 km (12,000 mi) deep. These zonal bands gradually drift from high latitudes towards the equator during the 11-year SOLAR CYCLE , moving in step with a similar motion of sunspots. Both the sunspots and the zonal bands are moving against another steady flow from the equator to the poles, which has a speed of about 20 m/s (66 ft/s). This flow penetrates to a depth of at least 25,000 km (15,500 mi). Researchers suspect that a return flow towards the equa- tor exists at deeper levels, but detailed motions have not y et been observed at this depth. solar mass (symbol M o . ) Mass of the Sun, used as a benchmark against which the masses of other stars are compared. One solar mass is equivalent to 1.99 \u0001 10 30 kg and accounts for over 99% of the total mass of the Solar System. Other stellar masses range from less than 0.2 M o . up to 100 M o . or more. Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) NASA satellite launched in 1980 February to study the Sun during a period of maximum activity at the peak of the SOLAR CYCLE . It failed after nine months, but repairs were successfully done by a Space Shuttle crew in 1984. The Solar Maximum Mission satellite re-entered Earth’s a tmosphere in 1989. One of its important results was the discovery of the variability of the SOLAR CONSTANT . solar nebula PROTOPLANETARY DISK that surrounded the early Sun and produced the planets of our Solar System. It had the same composition as the Sun, mostly h ydrogen and helium, with about 1% of heavier elements. In order to contain enough heavy elements to produce the planets, the total mass of the solar nebula must have been at least a few per cent of the Sun’s mass; it may have exceeded a tenth of a solar mass if planetary formation was inefficient. Most of that mass, in the form of gas and dust, dissipated after the planets had formed. See also COSMOGONY solar neutrinos Electron neutrinos ( see NEUTRINO ASTRONOMY ) produced in vast quantities by NUCLEAR REACTIONS in the Sun’s energy-generating core. Every second, an estimated 3 \u0001 10 15 solar electron neutrinos enter each square metre of the Earth’s Sun-facing side and pass out through the other side unimpeded. The neutrino reaction rate with matter is so small that a special Solar Neutrino Unit (SNU) is used to specify the flux. One SNU is equal to one neutrino interaction per second for every 10 36 a toms. To measure this flux, neutrino detectors must contain large amounts of material and be placed deep underground to filter out confusing energetic particles generated by COSMIC RAYS . The observed flux of electron neutrinos is compared with the number predicted by the STANDARD MODEL of the Sun. Typically, only one-third to one-half the predict- ed number were found in the pioneering experiments, a discrepancy known as the solar neutrino problem. For example, the HOMESTAKE MINE experiment obtained an av erage flux of 2.55 \u0002 0.25 SNU compared with the pre- dicted 8.0 \u0002 1.0 SNU. Other detectors, including Kamiokande, Sage and Gallex, gave similar findings. The solar neutrino problem might have been solved if there was a mistake in our models of the SOLAR INTERIOR . However, HELIOSEISMOLOGY observations accurately con- firm the predicted core temperature of 15.6 million K, indicating that the neutrino problem could not be solved with plausible variations in the standard model. In one alternative explanation, the electron neutrinos produced by nuclear reactions in the Sun’s core can change into muon or tau neutrinos on their way out of the solar mass 374 S \u0001 solar particles Charged particles from a solar flare were detected by SOHO’s LASCO camera just 3 minutes after the flare erupted from the Sun’s surface.

See also SOLAR NEUTRINOS solar parallax Apparent shift in position of the Sun as measured using the diameter of the Earth as a baseline. P ARALLAX is an important astronomical tool when determining distances to celestial objects. The apparent change in position of an object, when viewed from opposite ends of a chosen baseline of known length, allows its distance to be computed using simple trigonometry. For objects within the Solar System, the diameter of the Earth is used, which gives the DIURNAL P ARALLAX (or geocentric parallax). For more distant objects, the Earth’s orbit around the Sun provides a more appropriate baseline. Solar parallax is defined as being the angular size of the Earth’s equatorial radius as measured from a distance of one astronomical unit (1 A U). This method of determining the distance to the Sun has been very important in establishing the scale of the Solar System. solar particles Energetic particles that are expelled by the Sun into interplanetary space. Electrons, protons and other ions are being continuously blown in all directions into interplanetary space by the perpetual SOLAR WIND . CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS and FLARES hurl more energetic charged particles into space, producing powerful gusts in the solar wind that are important in solar–terrestrial interaction. Nuclear reactions in the SOLAR INTERIOR produce SOLAR NEUTRINOS , which are emitted from the Sun’s energy-generating core in all directions at nearly the speed of light.

This includes the nine planets and their accompanying satellites and ring systems, asteroids, comets, meteoroids and tenuous interplanetary dust and gas. The point at which the Solar System ends is called the heliopause, estimated to lie at a distance of 100 AU from the Sun. See also HELIOSPHERE solar telescope Fixed telescope, usually located within a tower, and dedicated to making observations of the Sun. Observing the Sun is not as straightforward as mak- ing observations of the stars or other celestial objects because of the extreme heating effect of its light. The Earth absorbs solar radiation, producing a layer of hot, turbulent air near ground-level, causing images formed by mirrors at this height to be blurred and unsteady. To ov ercome this, the light-gathering equipment is placed high above ground level at the top of a tall tower, some- times known as a solar tower. Light rays from the Sun are collected by an instrument such as a COELOSTAT or HELIOSTAT . These track the appar- ent motion of the Sun across the sky and use plain mirrors to direct its light down into the tower towards a curved, focusing mirror located at the bottom. From here, the light beam is reflected back up the tower and, via one or more flat mirrors, into a room where large instruments such as high-dispersion SPECTROHELIOGRAPHS may be located. The use of a tower allows long focal lengths to be obtained, which are necessary in order to form an image of the Sun with easily distinguishable detail. The tower, which is usually painted white in order to reduce the amount of solar radiation it absorbs, also protects the internal mirrors from wind and vibration. Its interior is often cooled or evacuated in order to further reduce dis- tortion of the image by moving currents of warm air. solar wind Solar material flowing into interplanetary space. The Sun’s atmosphere is expanding radially outwards in all directions at supersonic speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second, filling interplanetary space with charged particles and MAGNETIC FIELDS . This solar wind is made up of an equal number of electrons and protons, with lesser amounts of heavier ions. It carries solar material out into interstellar space at a rate of almost a million tonnes each second, flowing past the planets, which essentially orbit within the Sun’s outer atmosphere. The solar wind carves out a huge bubble in space with the Sun at its centre, known as the HELIOSPHERE , extending out to about 100 AU from the Sun. The existence of the solar wind was suggested from observations of COMET ion tails by the German astronomer Ludwig Biermann (1907–86) in the 1950s. A comet’s ion tail always points away from the Sun. While the RADIATION PRESSURE of sunlight is sufficient to push comets’ curved dust tails away from the Sun, it is not enough to create their ion tails. Biermann proposed that electrically charged par- ticles pour out from the Sun at all times and in all direc- tions, accelerating the ions to high speeds and pushing them radially away from the Sun in straight ion tails. In 1958 Eugene Parker (1927– ) of the University of Chicago showed how a flow might work, dubbing it the solar wind. It would naturally result from expansion of the Sun’s CORONA . At a critical distance of a few solar radii, the corona’s thermal energy overcomes the gravitational 375 S \u0001 solar telescope The New Swedish Solar Telescope on La Palma is operated by the Institute for Solar Physics of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

Parker also demonstrated how the Sun’s magnetic fields would be pulled into interplanetary space, acquiring a spiral shape as a result of the combined effects of radial solar wind flow and the Sun’s rotation. Spacecraft have been making in situ measurements of the solar wind since 1959. The average solar wind densi- ty near the Earth was shown in 1962–63 by Mariner 2 to be 5 \u0001 10 6 particles per cubic metre. Such a low density close to Earth’s orbit is a natural consequence of the wind’s expansion into an ever-greater volume. The Mariner 2 data also indicated that the solar wind has a slow and a fast component. The slow component travels at a mean speed of about 400 km/s (250 mi/s) and emanates from coronal streamers close to the solar equa- tor; the fast component travels at a mean speed of about 7500 km/s (4700 mi/s) and originates from the coronal holes. Subsequent spacecraft showed that the interplane- tary magnetic field has a strength of approximately 0.00006 Gauss (6 \u0001 10 \u0002 9 Tesla) at Earth’s orbit distance from the Sun. When fast solar wind streams interact with slow streams, they produce Co-rotating Interaction Regions (CIRs), in which forward and reverse shocks are generat- ed. Intense magnetic fields are also produced, and solar particles can be accelerated to high energies by CIRs. In 1994–95, near a minimum in the SOLAR CYCLE , the ULYSSES spacecraft made measurements of the solar wind over the full range of heliographic latitudes and at a dis- tance comparable to that of the Earth. Ulysses’ velocity data conclusively prove that a uniform, fast, low-density wind pours out at high latitudes near the solar poles, and that a gusty, higher-density, slow wind emanates from the Sun’s equatorial regions at solar minimum. Simultaneous observations with SOHO and YOHKOH pinpointed the sources of the solar wind on the Sun. The slow wind is associated with the narrow stalks of coronal streamers, at least during minimum in the solar activity cycle. Much of the high-speed wind escapes from polar coronal holes. Instruments on these spacecraft also showed that the high-speed wind is accelerated very close to the Sun (within just a few solar radii), and that the slow component attains full speed about ten times farther away. The SOHO observations also indicated that the fast wind in polar coronal holes emanates from the boundaries of the magnetic network seen in the CHROMOSPHERE , and that heavier particles move faster than light particles in polar coronal holes. Magnetic waves might provide this preferential acceleration. For example, oxygen ions have agitation speeds 60 times greater than those of protons in coronal holes. Ulysses has detected magnetic fluctuations, attributed to ALFVÉN WAVES , far above the Sun’s poles; they may block COSMIC RAYS . The solar wind plays an important role in shaping Earth’s MAGNETOSPHERE and the magnetospheres of the other planets. Particles and magnetic fields carried by the solar wind drive MAGNETIC STORMS .

With John HERSCHEL he co-authored a standard catalogue of 380 double stars, later discovering another 160 pairs. Realizing that further discoveries required a grander tele- scope, in 1829 South bought an 11 \u0001\u0002 -inch (300-mm) objective lens – then the world’s largest – by the French optician Robert Cauchoix (1776–1845). To build an equatorial mount he contracted with his then-friend Troughton. But Troughton, who by 1832 was ageing and had never built such a large mount, did not complete the job to South’s satisfaction, as the mount suffered from excessive vibration. South refused to pay Troughton, and years of costly litigation followed. When South was ordered to pay for the work he destroyed the mount and sold it as scrap metal.

The spacecraft, which weighs approximately 7 tonnes, is launched on a booster of the same name. It carries a maximum of three crew, who are housed in the flight cabin–descent module in the centre of the spacecraft. It has at its rear a service module with an in-orbit manoeuvring engine and two solar panels, and at the front it has an orbital module with a docking system at the forward end. Although earlier Soyuz modules flew independent flights, the TMs remained docked to the MIR space station for months, providing immediate availability for a return to Earth. A Soyuz TM is always docked to the INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) to provide emergency evacuation for the early three-person crews. Later, the ISS may have two Soyuz TMs available at all times for the six crew. Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) Last of the NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) Great Observatory series spacecraft, after the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (1990), the COMPTON GAMMA RAY OBSERVATORY (1991) and the CHANDRA X - RAY OBSERVATORY (1999). To be launched in 2002, it is expected to be named after a notable infrared astronomer. SIRTF is much smaller than originally planned and will be placed into an Earth-trailing solar orbit, providing excellent sky visibility and a benign thermal environment. It will continue the work conducted by the INFRARED ASTRONOMICAL SATELLITE , COSMIC BACKGROUND EXPLORER and the INFRARED SPACE OBSERVATORY . Its liquid-helium-cooled telescope is expected to operate for about three years before the cryogenic coolant is depleted. Spacelab Manned laboratory developed by the EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY to fly scientists and experiments into space in the cargo bay of the SPACE SHUTTLE . There were two basic elements: a pressurized laboratory, where scientists worked in a ‘shirt-sleeve’ environment; and one or more external pallets, which carried instruments that were directly exposed to space. Various combinations of these elements were possible. Several astronomy missions were flown during the 22 Spacelab flights between 1983 and 1998. space probe Space vehicle launched to investigate the Moon, the planets and their satellites, comets and asteroids, or to study interplanetary space. 377 S \u0001 Soyuz TM In addition to ferrying crews to and from Mir and the International Space Station, Soyuz modules have been used to transport equipment and satellites. The unmanned version is called Progress and it was one of these that collided with Mir.

The USA’s Space Shuttle had flown over 100 missions by the end of 2001, 20 years since its maiden flight. The Shuttle has made space travel almost look routine, albeit not quite as regular an occurrence as was hoped when the programme began life in 1972 with President Richard Nixon’s signature. At the time 50 missions a year were envisaged, rather than the seven to eight actually flown. The Space Shuttle comprises three main elements. The orbiter is equipped with three main engines called the SSMEs, which are fuelled by liquid oxygen and liquid hy drogen fed from a large brown external tank attached to the belly of the orbiter. The external tank (ET) is the only part of the Shuttle that is expendable, being abandoned to re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere when the orbiter has reached initial orbit. Attached to either side of the ET are two solid rocket boosters (SRBs), which supplement the SSMEs during the first 2 minutes of flight and which are recovered from the sea after each flight. Most parts of the SRBs are used again on future Shuttle flights. The Shut- tle’s payloads are carried primarily in the payload bay, which is 18.3 m (60 ft) long and 4.6 m (15 ft) wide. Addi- tional cargo and experiments, as well as equipment and consumables for the crew, are located in the mid-deck, which is under the flight deck. The mid-deck also acts as the wardroom, kitchen and temporary gym and is equipped with a toilet. The maximum payload capability of 24,947 kg has not yet been carried on any Shuttle mis- sion. The payload capability depends on the orbital incli- nation taken by a mission. Each degree higher than 28º takes 226 kg off the payload weight. Missions from the Kennedy Space Center can fly up the eastern seaboard of the USA into a 57º orbit – on one reconnaissance satellite deployment mission, this was extended to 62º. Six Shuttle orbiters have been built, starting with the Enterprise in 1977. This was not a spaceworthy craft and w as used for atmospheric glide tests before the space mis- sions could be attempted. The first orbiter to make an orbital spaceflight was Columbia in 1981 and the second, Challenger , in 1983. This was followed by Discovery in 1984 and Atlantis in 1985. After Challenger w as lost in 1986, a replacement orbiter, Endeavour , was built , which flew for the first time in 1992. The orbiter is 37.24 m (122.2 ft) long with a wingspan of 23.79 m (78.06 ft) and is 17.27 m (56.67 ft) high from the undercarriage to the top of the vertical stabilizer. The Space Shuttle on the launch pad and fully loaded for lift-off weighs 2,041,186 kg, of which the orbiter accounts for about 113,399 kg. The SRBs are 45.46 m (149.15 ft) and 3.70 m (12.14 ft) in diameter. The ET is 47 m (154 ft) long and 8.38 m (27.5 ft) wide. The total length of the whole stack from the tip of the ET to the tail of the SRBs is 56.14 m (184.2 ft). Most flights of the Space Shuttle carry the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), which is a sophisticated robot arm controlled from the flight deck by specialist RMS operator astronauts, who use a hand controller, a computer, TV cameras on the RMS and the view out of the rear window of the flight deck. The RMS is used to deploy and retrieve payloads and as a mobile carrier for space-walking astronauts who stand on a foot restraint at the end of the arm. The 15.24-m (50-ft) long RMS is fitted with a ‘shoulder’, ‘elbow’, ‘wrist’ and ‘hand’, to enable it to be moved into all kinds of positions. The RMS has proved invaluable to the Shuttle programme and its technology is being utilized for the INTERNATION - AL SPACE STATION . At the end of a mission, after the retrofire, the Shuttle begins its transition from a spaceship to a glider as it starts re-entry at about 121,920 m (400,000 ft), approximately 8000 km (5000 mi) from the landing site at a speed of about Mach 25. There are six types of thermal material to protect parts of the orbiter that experience varied heat lev- els, the wing leading edges and underside bearing the brunt of the re-entry heating (1530 K), while the upper part of the fuselage is less exposed to heat. The approach to the landing site, usually at the Kennedy Space Center, is made at an angle seven times steeper and a speed 20 times faster than an airliner, and at touchdown the speed is over 320 km/h (200 mph). space station Large orbiting structure with substantial living and working accommodation which is designed to be permanently or intermittently manned. Space stations have many potential roles. These include experimental and observational work in the pure sciences (astronomy, physics, life sciences); environmental moni- toring; research and development work in applied sciences; industrial activity utilizing the space environment (virtual zero gravity, ultra-high vacuum) for materials processing; providing a servicing base for satellites and free-flying structures; and providing a base for further constructional w ork in space. There are also various potential military applications, such as surveillance, servicing of satellites and anti-missile activity. Space stations may eventually provide a base for the launching and return of interplanetary exploration missions, manned or unmanned. The first space station to be placed in orbit was the Soviet SALYUT 1 in 1971. The lone US competition came in 1973 with the launch of SKYLAB . A major advance came with the introduction of the second generation of Soviet space stations and the assembly of separate units in orbit. The first demonstration of this technique was the linking of the COSMOS 1267 module to Salyut 6 in 1981. Howev- er, the real breakthrough came in 1986 February, when the Soviet Union launched the core module of its MIR (‘Peace’) station. Mir was equipped with four radial dock- ing ports in addition to the usual access at the front and rear. Five additional modules and a US-made docking unit were attached to the station in 1987–96. Even before Mir re-entered the atmosphere in 2001 March, construction of an INTERNATIONAL SPACE STA - TION had begun. Under the leadership of the USA, 16 nations came together to contribute to the largest space structure ever placed in orbit. Assembly is scheduled to be completed by 2006. Space Telescope Science Institute (STScl) Astro- nomical research centre responsible for operating the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE . Located at the Homewood campus of the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, the STScI was founded in 1980 and is operat- ed by A URA under contract to NASA . Besides its service role Space Shuttle 378 S \u0001 Space Shuttle Columbia was first launched on 1981 April 12 and, after a major refit, was brought back into service in 2002 March for the third Hubble servicing mission.

The laws of physics proposed by Isaac Newton in the late 17th century were based on the supposition that three- dimensional space was fundamentally different from time. In fact, time played a role of only increasing at a constant rate everywhere in the Universe. In SPECIAL RELATIVITY , time lost its special role and became another dimension, not quite equivalent to the other three, but could not be assumed to tick off at the same rate for every observer. Thus, relativity transformed our picture of the Universe from three spatial dimensions to a four- dimensional spacetime continuum. GENERAL RELATIVITY a ttributes gravity to the warping or bending of spacetime due to the presence of mass and energy. space velocity Tr ue speed and direction of a star through space, relative to the Sun. From observations of a star’s position it is possible to measure its PROPER MOTION – its movement across our line of sight – and from that to calculate its T ANGENTIAL VELOCITY . Observations of the Doppler shift in its spectrum reveal how fast it is travelling away from us, in other words its RADIAL VELOCITY . Because the two lie at right angles to one another, simple trigonometry can be used to calculate their resultant, which gives a measure of the star’s actual speed and direction through space. Spacewatch ASTEROID and COMET search programme based at the University of Arizona, USA, employing telescopes at Kitt Peak. Spacewatch, founded by Tom Gehrels (1925– ), was the first NEAR - EARTH OBJECT project to make use of charge-coupled devices. Many comets discovered in this project have been given the name Spacewatch. space weather Responses of Earth’s local space environment to variations on the Sun, such as CORONAL MASS EJECTIONS , FLARES , solar particle events and associated interplanetary shocks. Monitoring and predicting these variations is becoming more widespread because many modern technological systems are increasingly susceptible to these effects. For example, these severe solar disturbances propagate out to the Earth and drive GEOMAGNETIC STORMS in the MAGNETOSPHERE . These in turn cause dramatic increases in the particle populations in the VA N ALLEN BELTS and in the electrical currents flowing in the magnetosphere and IONOSPHERE . Navigation, communication and weather satellites orbiting the Earth may be damaged or destroyed if they pass through these enhanced radiation environments. Hazardous radiation levels may also be experienced by astronauts, and in extreme cases by passengers in aircraft flying high over the poles of the Earth. Communication between spacecraft and the ground may be affected by disturbances in the ionosphere. The ionospheric drag on low-Earth-orbit satellites may increase, thus reducing the satellites’ operational lifetime. Ionospheric currents generate magnetic fields on the g round, which may disrupt the operations of large power- distribution grids. For example, such magnetic fields were the cause of a 9-hour blackout affecting 9 million people in Quebec, Canada, in 1989 March. These fields can also introduce significant errors in geomagnetic surveys used in the commercial exploration of natural resources, such as drilling for oil. Space weather effects are particularly prevalent during the maximum of the SOLAR CYCLE , although they may occur at any time. Various agencies around the world are engaged in routine monitoring of the Sun, the solar wind and the terrestrial magnetosphere and attempt to predict which events will have major impact on the Earth environ- ment. Such predictions allow appropriate protective mea- sures, such as powering down susceptible systems, to be implemented before damage occurs. spallation NUCLEAR REACTION wherein a nucleus is struck by a particle whose energy is greater than 50 MeV. Usually this is a COSMIC RAY impact with the nucleus of an atom in the interstellar medium. It leads to fragmentation of the nucleus and the production of light elements ( see ASTROCHEMISTRY and NUCLEOSYNTHESIS ). Spallation is also the ejection of debris from the back of a surface, or around the point of impact, for an object hit at high speed by a macroscopic particle, such as micro- meteoroid impacts on spacecraft. Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) Research institution of the Russian Academy of Sciences, estab- lished in 1966, and the only Russian centre for ground- based astronomy. The observatory is located near the town of Zelenchukskaya in the North Caucasus. Its two facilities are the BTA (Bolshoi Teleskop Azimutal’ny, or Large Altazimuth Telescope), completed in 1976, and – 20 km (12 mi) to the south-east – the RATAN-600 (for 600-m Radio Telescope Antenna), opened in 1977. The BTA is at an elevation of 2100 m (6890 ft) and, with its 6.05-m (238-in.) mirror, was for 15 years the largest opti- cal telescope in the world. The RATAN-600 is similarly generously proportioned, with a 0.6-km (0.4-mi) diame- ter multi-element ring antenna that can be pointed by tilt- ing the individual panels of the ring. The SAO carries out research over the full range of modern astrophysics, and has branches in St Petersburg and Moscow. special relativity Theory of mechanics proposed by Albert EINSTEIN in 1905 that correctly describes the motions of objects moving near the speed of light. Einstein proposed a version of mechanics based on the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATIONS . Einstein’s theory returns results identical to Newton’s laws for small velocities relative to the speed of light, but predicts substantial differences for objects moving close to the speed of light. A primary postulate for special relativity is that we live in a four-dimensional SPACETIME continuum, and that time is relative to the reference frame of the observer. A second postulate is that observers always measure the speed of light at the same value: lightspeed is an invariant quantity in relativity. Lorentz transformations predict that time runs slower in the reference frame of the object as it moves relative to a stationary observer: time slows down with increasing v elocity. These propositions also show that in the refer- ence frame of a stationary observer, the object in motion is physically smaller in the direction of motion, being smaller when closer to the speed of light. Finally, special relativity predicts that mass increases with velocity. These important considerations led to the famous equation E = mc 2 , spelling out the equivalence of mass and energy. The mass ( m ) multiplied by the speed of light ( c ) squared yields a tremendous amount of energy ( E ), since the speed of light is huge (roughly 300,000 km/s or 186,000 mi/s). This discovery allowed astronomers to explain energy generation in the Sun as caused by NUCLEAR REACTIONS converting hydrogen to helium. Every aspect of special relativity has been confirmed to a high degree of accuracy numerous times. speckle interferometry T echnique for improving the resolution of astronomical images by removing the blur- r ing caused by turbulence in the Earth’s atmosphere. When the light from a star passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted in random directions over periods of tens of milliseconds by constantly moving pockets of air of vary- ing density and temperature. This refraction produces multiple images of the star that appear to dance around (twinkle) many times a second and be blurred. The effect is known as SEEING . The light refracted from the individual atmospheric cells reaches different parts of the telescope’s optics at dif- 379 S S AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:23 pm Page 379"},{"pageNumber":389,"pageContent":"ferent times and from different directions, resulting in either constructive INTERFERENCE (peaks of separate wa v es coincide) or destructive interference (peaks and troughs coincide). This produces a series of bright and dark regions, giving a highly contrasted mottled or grainy appearance. The bright regions are known as speckles, several hundred of which may be seen, and the speckle pattern represents the random distribution of atmospheric irregularities. Because the atmosphere is turbulent, this pattern changes quite rapidly with time so that images of stars taken with exposures of about a second or more become smeared into what is known as the ‘seeing disk’. F or short time-exposures, however, the atmospheric motion is frozen and the full speckle pattern is revealed. Speckle interferometry involves the use of a detector such as a CCD to take a sequence of short-exposure (10–15 milliseconds) ‘snapshots’ of an object, freezing its apparent motion. Each snapshot produces an instantaneously dis- torted image and the sequence can then be combined by computer image-processing, electronically removing the a tmospheric effects, to produce a distortion-free image. The technique is not limited to stellar observations. In recent years, speckle interferometry has been successfully applied to various solar phenomena and has also been used to map surface features on Saturn’s moon Titan. spectral classification System of classifying the spectra of stars ( see SPECTRUM ). In the mid-19th century, when astronomers began to observe the brighter stars with SPECTROSCOPES , they discovered a rich variety of spectra that required some system of classification. Of several original schemes, that by Father Angelo SECCHI w as the most widely adopted. His system contained five types that were based on both the stars’ colours and the details within their spectra: Type I contained blue-white stars with strong hydrogen ABSORPTION LINES (for example, Sirius and Vega); Type II referred to yellow and orange stars with numerous metallic spectrum lines (the Sun, Capella, Arcturus); Type III contained orange-red stars with metallic lines and bands, now known to be caused by titanium oxide (TiO), that shaded to the blue (Betelgeuse, Antares); Type IV included deep-red stars that had dark carbon bands shaded to the red; Type V w as reserved for stars with bright EMISSION LINES . As spectroscopes improved and photography became av ailable, better spectroscopic detail required a more com- prehensive description. A system devised between 1890 and 1901 by Harvard’s E.C. PICKERING and his assistants (Williamina FLEMING , Antonia MAURY and Annie J. CAN - NON ) originally used letters from A to Q based primarily on the strengths of the hydrogen lines such that A–D belonged to Secchi’s Type I, E–L to Type II, M to Type III, carbon-line N to Type IV, and O–Q to Type V. With improved observations, several letters were dropped as unnecessary, while the work of Maury and Cannon showed better continuity of all the lines if B were to come before A and O before B. The final result was the classic spectral sequence OBAFGKM. Cannon then added for each class simple numerical subtypes from 0 to 9, such that B0 to B9 is followed by A0 to A9 and so on (the modern system beginning at O3). Cannon’s classifi- cation of about 225,000 stars was published between 1918 and 1924 in the HENRY DRAPER CATALOGUE . (A later extension increased the count to 359,082.) Based in part on the presence of emission lines, M was originally subdivided into Ma to Md and O from Oa to Oe, but these were eventually made numeric as well (‘e’ and ‘f ’ are now descriptive terms for emission lines). R STARS , which are the warmer versions of class N CARBON STARS , were added in 1908. SST ARS , which are intermedi- a te carbon stars with bands of zirconium oxide, were added in 1924. The system was quickly seen to correlate with colour that progressed from blue to red, and thus with tempera- ture, class O to M ranging from 50,000 to 2000 K. The development of physical theory demonstrated that the spectral sequence O to M represents an ionization and excitation sequence, not one of chemical composition. R, N and S, however, are different, containing various enhancements of carbon. Though some carbon stars are DW ARF STARS (with their own classification schemes), all the R, N and S stars are GIANT STARS . Temperatures in the classes R and N (now combined into class C) charac- terize the track on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of ordinary stars evolving from mid-G to late M, whereas class S temperatures track only class M. Improved infrared technology in the last decade of the 20th century began to turn up stars that were not classi- fiable on the original scheme. In 1999 class L ( see L STARS ) was added to account for deep-red (really infrared) stars in which the strong TiO bands of class M ( see MST ARS ) were replaced by powerful absorptions of h ydrides and the alkali metals, the temperatures falling from 2000 to 1500 K. TST ARS , at the end, near 1000 K, are defined by methane bands. Class L is a mixture of RED DWARFS and BROWN DWARFS , while T is reserved for low-mass brown dwarfs. Va r ious comments are commonly added to the basic spectral types to describe details. Dwarfs and giants were originally prefixed by ‘d’ and ‘g’ (the Sun, for example, is a dG2 star, Arcturus is gK1). A separate classification by Maury used a, b and c to describe line widths. Sharp-lined stars, class c, were later seen to be SUPERGIANTS . The descriptive is still in use: Lc stars, for example, are irregu- lar supergiant variables. Also, ‘e’, ‘m’, ‘p’, ‘wk’, respective- ly, stand for ‘emission’, ‘metallic’, ‘peculiar’ and ‘weak-line’ (Sirius is an A1m star). The HARVARD SYSTEM w as not adequate to deal with the differences between dwarfs, giants and supergiants, that is, stars of different luminosities at a given tempera- ture. In 1943 William MORGAN , Philip Childs Keenan (1908–2000) and Edith Marie Kellman (1911– ) rede- fined the spectral types and introduced a two-dimensional classification system. The MORGAN – KEENAN CLASSIFICA - TION (MK or MKK) scheme retained the decimally sub- divided OBAFGKM temperature sequence. To each of the classes is added a Roman numeral that describes the luminosity of the star, I to V standing for supergiant to dwarf, the Sun (a G2 dwarf) is thus classified as G2 V. Keenan later added Arabic ‘0’ to define super-supergiants (hypergiants). The MK system gives precise details of which ratios of spectrum line strengths are to be used to determine the spectral types, and it provides photographic examples of bright stars that act as classification stan- dards. Summaries of both Harvard and MK classes are gi v en in the accompanying tables.

The decimal divisions can also be more finely divided, B0.5 falling between B0 and B1. Intermediate luminosity classes are expressed by hyphenated Roman numerals, 09 IV–V falling between subgiant and giant. The MK system is applicable only to stars of normal (that is, solar) chemical composition. Roman numeral VI for metal-poor SUBDWARFS is therefore inconsistent. WHITE DWARFS w ere originally classified on a pseudo-Har- v ard scheme, with D preceding the type: DA white dwarfs have strong hydrogen lines; DB and DO strong helium lines; and DC only a continuum. These types bear more relation to odd chemical compositions than they do to temperature. DA now refers to white dwarfs with hydro- gen envelopes, DB or non-DA to the others (those with helium-rich atmospheres). A more complex scheme is now available. For stars that contain spectral abnormali- ties, an MK type may be assigned together with an indica- tion of the strength of the peculiarity; for example K0III-CN3 shows that the star has anomalously strong bands of CN, and K2II-Ba5 indicates that the K2 giant is an extreme BARIUM STAR . Carbon content is also added to the spectral class, for example C2,4, where the latter num- ber indicates band strength. To be properly classified on the MK system, the spec- trum of a star must be photographed in the blue-violet with a SPECTROGRAPH of prescribed type and with an appropriate classification dispersion. Higher dispersions can reveal lines that are not seen under low-dispersion conditions and can lead to mis-classification. It is com- mon, however, to calibrate a different system of absorp- tion lines in a different part of the spectrum (red, ultraviolet) against the MK standards. Such calibration is also necessary for classifications achieved with modern CCD (charge-coupled device) detectors, whose data are rendered graphically rather than photographically. A vari- ety of quantitative and computer-aided schemes are also av ailable. For consistency, however, all need to be calibrat- ed against the original MK standards. spectral type Series of divisions into which stars are classified according to the appearance of their SPECTRUM . A star’s spectral type is ultimately based on temperature, luminosity and to some degree chemical composition. See SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION spectrogram Recording of a SPECTRUM . Spectrograms w ere originally recorded on photographic plates. With the electronic revolution in astronomy, in particular with the advent of charge-coupled devices ( CCD s), spectrograms are now recorded digitally for graphical and computer- aided display. Photographic spectrograms are difficult to calibrate in terms of light intensity, while the electronic (digital) versions easily lend themselves to analysis. spectrograph Device that takes and records SPECTROGRAMS . Spectrographs are the permanent- recording versions of the original spectroscopes through which astronomers made direct visual examinations of spectra. The first spectrographs used prisms as dispersing elements and recorded the spectra on photographic plates. Modern spectrographs are large and complex pieces of equipment. They are often positioned at a stationary focus of a telescope, such as the COUDÉ or NASMYTH FOCUS . Light from a star or other celestial object enters a narrow slit and passes through a collimator, producing a parallel beam. This is directed on to a DIFFRACTION GRATING , a piece of reflective material ruled with thousands of parallel lines, to disperse the light. The resultant spectrum is then imaged on to a detector such as a CCD . The use of a nar- row entrance slit means that only an image of this, rather than the star image, which will be distorted by atmospheric effects, is recorded. This prevents adjacent wavelengths being smeared out and keeps the spectrum sharp. Spectrographs contain different types of diffraction gr a tings to produce either high-, medium- or low-resolu- tion spectra, depending on the required application. An Echelle spectrograph uses an ECHELLE GRATING , which produces spectra with a high degree of resolution over a narrow band of wavelengths. The grooves of an echelle gr a ting are stepped and their spacing relatively wide, pro- ducing a number of high-resolution overlapping spectra, which are then separated by a second, lower-dispersion gr a ting. An astronomer might use a variety of different spectrographs to study an object. For example, if he or she w ere attempting to identify the optical counterpart of a known X-ray source, a low-resolution spectrograph might be used to obtain rapidly the spectra of all the possible candidates. From this survey, the X-ray object could be identified by its spectral properties, at which point an intermediate-resolution instrument would be used to obtain more detailed information, isolating features of interest. If even greater detail were required, a high-resolu- tion instrument would be brought into use. Modern, large telescopes are equipped with a variety of such instruments for this very purpose. An examination of some of the spectroscopic instru- ments available for astronomers to use on the twin Keck telescopes reveals the diversity of today’s equipment. ESI, an Echellette Spectrograph and Imager, is used for obtaining high-resolution spectra of very faint galaxies and quasars from the blue to the infrared in a single expo- sure. It can also be configured to record lower-resolution spectra of several objects simultaneously. HIRES, as its name suggests, is a high-resolution instrument that oper- a tes in the 0.3–1.1 \u0001 m range and can measure the precise intensity of thousands of separate wavelengths. LRIS is a low-resolution imaging spectrograph that can take spectra of up to 30 objects simultaneously, making it suitable for studying stellar populations of distant galaxies as well as galactic clusters and quasars. LWS is a long-wavelength spectrograph, designed for the study of planetary nebulae, protostellar objects and galactic cores. Finally, NIRSPEC, the near-infrared spectrometer, is an echelle spectrograph that operates in the 1–5 \u0001 m range and is designed for the study of very high redshift radio galaxies and the motions of stars near the galactic centre. It can also be used to study active galactic nuclei, interstellar chemistry and stel- lar physics. See also SPECTROSCOPY ; SPECTROMETER spectroheliograph Instrument used for imaging the Sun in light of a particular wavelength (monochromatical- ly). In principle, the spectroheliograph operates like a SPECTROHELIOSCOPE with a photographic plate or digital detector placed very closely behind the exit slit. An image of the Sun is projected from the telescope on to the nar- row entrance slit, which is used to select the part of the solar disk or CHROMOSPHERE to be observed. A DIFFRAC - TION GRATING disperses the light into a SPECTRUM , and a second slit is then used to select the exact wavelength of light required, usually corresponding to one of the Sun’s main elements, such as hydrogen (which produces the spectral line H \u0002 ) or calcium (K).

The spectrohelioscope is the visual equivalent of the SPECTROHELIOGRAPH , in that an image of the solar disk is projected from a telescope into a narrow entrance slit. A DIFFRACTION GRATING disperses the light into a SPEC - TRUM , and the exact wavelength to be observed is set using a second slit. The observer can thus select the ele- ment within the Sun and the depth in the solar atmos- phere that they wish to view. By rapidly scanning the solar disk and its prominences with a repetition rate exceeding ten per second, by persistence of vision the observer sees a stationary monochromatic image. Scanning is commonly achieved by vibrating the two slits synchronously at high frequency, but some instruments have fixed slits that are scanned optically. This apparatus is usually so bulky that it is mounted with its entrance slit at the focus of a fixed telescope served by a HELIOSTAT or COELOSTAT and second mirror. The focal ratio of the spectrohelioscope must be the same as the fixed telescope so that, although the optics are invariably folded to put the entrance and exit slits adjacent to each other, the complete system is longer than twice the focal length of the fixed telescope. The wide range of possible settings and its suitability for the measurement of radial velocity of violent solar dis- turbances make the spectrohelioscope a more versatile monochromatic instrument than optical filters. The detail seen increases as the slit width is reduced, but this necessi- tates a high scanning rate to ensure adequate image brightness. Wider slit widths show limb prominences only b ut disk detail is not visible. spectrometer Instrument used for observing and mea- suring features of a SPECTRUM , such as the spectral lines, by direct observation. The spectrometer incorporates a SPECTROSCOPE , to split light from a celestial object into its component wavelengths, producing a spectrum, together with a device such as a F ABRY – PEROT INTERFEROMETER , to measure accurately the positions and intensities of the emission and absorption lines within the spectrum. See also SPECTROSCOPY spectrophotometer Instrument used for measuring the relative intensities of ABSORPTION and EMISSION LINES in different parts of a SPECTRUM . The line profile of the spectrum that the spectrophotometer produces is a graph of how intensity varies with wavelength. This measure of the amount of radiation of a particular wavelength that has been absorbed or emitted by a celestial object is an indica- tion of the relative concentration of chemical elements present within the object. The spectrophotometer can be used for the study of spectra at ultraviolet and infrared as w ell as visible wavelengths. spectroscope Instrument that splits electromagnetic radiation into its constituent wavelengths, producing a characteristic SPECTRUM . The spectrum can be observed visually or recorded in some form, in which case the instrument is known as a SPECTROGRAPH . Since all astro- nomical data is now recorded for future analysis, the term spectrograph is almost universally used to describe this sort of instrument. spectroscopic binary BINARY STAR that is too close for its components to be resolved optically; its orbital motion is deduced from periodic shifts in its spectral lines, indicating variable radial velocity. A spectroscopic binary is likely to be a CLOSE BINARY with a short orbital period and relatively high radial velocity. Binaries cannot be detected spectroscopically if their orbit is perpendicular to the Earth. If the components have similar brightness, both sets of SPECTRAL LINES are observed, and the system is called a double-lined spectroscopic binary. A composite spectrum binary has a spectrum that consists of two sets of lines from stars of dissimilar spectral type. Systems with only one set of spectral lines observable are known as single- lined spectroscopic binaries. The RADIAL VELOCITY of the star (or stars) is deter- mined by measuring the DOPPLER SHIFT of the spectral lines. In double-lined spectroscopic binaries, the relative v elocities ( v ) of the two components can be determined and hence the relative masses ( M ), using: The individual masses can be determined if the inclination of the orbit is known, for example when the system is also an ECLIPSING BINARY . spectroscopic parallax Method of obtaining the distances of stars from their SPECTRAL TYPES ( see SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION ) and apparent magnitudes. Analysis of the SPECTRUM reveals the full spectral class in the MORGAN – KEENAN CLASSIFICATION system. These classes have all been calibrated in terms of absolute visual magnitude through the measurement of the distances of stars by TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX and by main- sequence cluster fitting. The spectral class of any star thus gi v es its absolute visual magnitude. Comparison with the apparent visual magnitude gives the distance modulus and therefore, through the magnitude equation, the distance itself. The method is dependent on an assessment of the degree of interstellar EXTINCTION to the star. This can be found from the degree of REDDENING through comparison of the actual colour with that inferred from the spectral class. The chief unknown is the ratio of total to selective extinction (that is, the relation between reddening and total absorption), which can vary from place to place depending on the nature of the absorbing dust grains. spectroscopy Practice of obtaining, and the study of, the SPECTRUM of an astronomical object. Astronomical spectroscopy is the key technique by which the physical properties of astronomical bodies are revealed. Spectra are obtained with a SPECTROGRAPH , and recordings are made of the distribution of light relative to wavelength for the object concerned. Current instruments allow the precise measurement of the following: the flux distribution (energy per unit area per unit time per unit wavelength) of the v 1 = M 2 —– ––— v 2 M 1 spectrohelioscope 382 S \u0001 spectroscopic binary Redshift is used to ascertain the relative motions of stars in close binary pairs. When a star is moving away, its spectrum is shifted to the red, whereas the spectrum of a star moving towards us will be blueshifted. When both stars are moving at right angles to our line of sight their spectra are not displaced. two stars orbiting their centre of mass to Earth position of undisplaced spectral line combined spectra violet red AB BA A+B A B A+B A B A B A B S AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:23 pm Page 382"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"spicules continuum; the fluxes, wavelengths and shapes of EMISSION LINES ; and the wavelengths, strengths (the amounts of energy extracted from the continuum) and the detailed profiles (exact distribution of radiation with wa v elength) of ABSORPTION LINES . Reduction of spectrographic data to actual radiative fluxes requires calibration of the sensitivity of the detector, and also requires calibration with standard astronomical sources to correct for wavelength-dependent absorption by the Earth’s atmosphere (if the telescope is ground based) and the telescope/spectrograph optics. The deter- mination of precise wavelengths for RADIAL VELOCITIES requires observation of wavelength standards. In older spectrographs, these were iron arcs set within the spectro- g raph. The iron spectrum was displayed photographically on either side of the spectrum of the source. In modern spectrographs, the standards are gas emission tubes whose spectra are digitally compared with those of the source. The data then allow accurate physical analysis of astro- nomical sources. For example, the energy distribution of the continuum reveals the nature of the source, whether thermal (produced by a hot gas) or non-thermal (perhaps synchrotron emission from a supernova remnant). Emis- sion line fluxes and wavelengths of nebulae, galaxies, quasars and a variety of other sources allow the determi- nation of temperatures, densities, velocities (both radial v elocities and those related to internal motions) and chemical compositions. Absorption line strengths and profiles allow the deduction of temperatures, densities, surface gravities, magnetic fields, rotation speeds and chemical compositions of stars. These principles extend to all wavelength domains. Gamma-ray, X-ray and ultraviolet spectra are observed by space-borne telescopes and spectrographs. Infrared as w ell as visual spectra are observed with both ground- based and orbiting spectrographs. Radio telescopes are also fitted with spectrographs that use electronic tech- niques for the observation of emission, absorption and continuous spectra from a great variety of radio sources, from molecular clouds to galaxies. spectrum Distribution of ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION with wavelength; a ‘map’ of brightness plotted against wavelength (or frequency). A continuous spectrum is an unbroken distribution over a broad range of wavelengths. At visible wavelengths, for example, white light may be split into a continuous band of colours ranging from red to violet. An EMISSION SPECTRUM comprises light emitted at particular wavelengths only ( EMISSION LINES ), and an absorption spectrum consists of a series of dark ABSORPTION LINES superimposed on a continuous spectrum. The spectrum of a star normally consists of a continu- ous spectrum together with dark absorption lines, though in some cases emission lines are also present. Emission line spectra are typical of luminous nebulae. Astronomical spectra extend to all wavelengths, from the gamma-ray domain through X-ray, ultraviolet, optical (visual) and infrared, to radio. High-energy gamma-ray and X-ray spectra are usually plotted against energy (kiloelectron v olts, keV, or megaelectron volts, MeV) rather than wave- length. Wavelength in nanometres (1 nm = 10 \u0001 9 m) or angstroms (1 Å = 10 \u0001 8 m) is used for ultraviolet and opti- cal, whereas infrared observations use micrometres (1 \u0002 m=10 \u0001 6 m). Radio spectra, on the other hand, use frequency units (cycles per second, or hertz, kilohertz, megahertz or gigahertz, expressed as Hz, kHz, MHz, GHz respectively). The term ‘spectrum’ is also applied to a distribution of particle energies: that is, an energy spectrum is a plot of the numbers of particles with particular energies against the range of possible energies. spectrum variable Star showing low amplitude light va ri a tions, but having a spectrum with ABSORPTION LINES that vary in strength by larger amounts, sometimes in a clearly periodic manner. The class of spectrum variables includes peculiar stars of spectral type A (Ap) and early F (Fp). The brightest and best studied example is the Ap star ALPHA 2 CANUM VENATICORUM . In this star, variations in spectrum, brightness and magnetic field are all cyclical, with a period of 5.46939 days, equivalent to its rotation period. Models derived from observations suggest that spectrum variable stars are objects in which quantities of particular metallic elements are concentrated in patches in the stellar atmosphere; absorption lines due to specific elements are most prominent when these patches are presented in line of sight by the star’s rotation. Some spectral type B stars also show such variations. speculum metal See REFLECTING TELESCOPE spherical aberration Imperfections in an image produced by lenses or mirrors having spherical surfaces. When light parallel to the optical axis is focused by a spherical lens or mirror, the light close to the axis will be focused at a different point from light farther from the axis, thus producing an imperfect image. Spherical aberration is the main ABERRATION affecting simple optical systems; it can be reduced by the use of aspheric optics such as P ARABOLOIDS . spherical astronomy Largely obsolete term describing the mathematical calculations necessary to determine the positions and distances of celestial objects on the celestial sphere. The sky can be thought of as the inside of a sphere surrounding the Earth; to locate positions on the sphere requires the precise measurement of the angular displacement between the object in question and a set of reference points. Distances to nearby objects may be determined using TRIGONOMETRIC PARALLAX . See also ANNUAL PARALLAX ; ASTROMETRY ; CELESTIAL COORDINATES ; P ARALLAX spheroid Shape formed by rotating an ELLIPSE about one of its axes. If the major axis is chosen, the spheroid is prolate; if the minor is chosen, it is oblate. A self- gr a vitating, rotating planetary body is distorted by centrifugal force into an oblate spheroid, with equatorial radius greater than polar. The shape, called a Maclaurin spheroid, depends on the body’s density and rotation rate.

They have a spiky appearance. Spicules are seen in spectrograms or SPECTROHELIOGRAMS , especially those taken in the red wing of the HYDROGEN - ALPHA LINE . Spicules change rapidly, having a lifetime of five to fifteen minutes and velocities of about 25 km/s (16 mi/s). T ypically, spicules are about one kilometre thick, and thousands of kilometres long. They are not distributed uniformly on the Sun, being concentrated along the cell boundaries of the SUPERGRANULATION pattern. spider Thin, usually wire or metal support holding the SECONDARY mirror in the tube of a REFLECTING TELE - SCOPE . The support may commonly have three or four ‘legs’, DIFFRACTION effects from which give rise to the cross patterns often seen in astronomical images. spin casting T echnique for manufacturing large para- bolic telescope mirrors by spinning molten glass in a rotating furnace and allowing centrifugal forces to pro- duce the required curvature in the surface. Astronomical mirrors are traditionally cast flat, and large quantities of glass are then ground out and discarded to create the correct shape, in a time-consuming and costly process. Spin casting involves heating blocks of borosilicate glass in a honeycomb mirror mould to around 1453 K. As the furnace rotates, the surface of the molten glass assumes a paraboloidal shape. It is then allowed to cool and solidify whilst still spinning. spiral galaxy GALAXY that has a thin disk of stars, gas and dust, in which a more or less continuous spiral pattern appears. Most spiral galaxies also contain a central spherical bulge of old stars. The spiral pattern may be maintained as a DENSITY WAVE moving through the disk, or by differential rotation shearing star-forming regions into locally tilted segments. Thus spirals range from grand design patterns, with between two and four arms traceable through complete turns around the galaxy, to flocculent galaxies, in which only small, discontinuous pieces of the spiral pattern exist. Most spiral galaxies have at least a weak bar, an elongation of the nuclear bulge, in the plane of the disk. Spirals are classified into various subtypes in the HUBBLE CLASSIFICATION . Most maintain active star formation and have a significant reservoir of interstellar gas to fuel additional generations of stars. Spitzer, Lyman Jr (1914–97) American astrophysicist who studied stellar dynamics and interstellar matter, and originated the concept of a telescope in Earth orbit. After helping to develop sonar during World War II, he suc- ceeded Henry Norris R USSELL as head of the astronomy department and observatory director at Princeton Univer- sity, where he spent the rest of his working life. From the late 1930s, Spitzer investigated interstellar matter (ISM), establishing it as a major research field. Observing that elliptical galaxies contained old stars and lacked ISM, whereas spirals contained younger stars and w ere rich in ISM, he concluded that stars formed from condensing clouds of interstellar gas and dust. He studied the effect of heating and cooling and of interstellar mag- netic fields on the ISM. This interest in magnetic fields led Spitzer to another line of enquiry, the possibility of power generation by nuclear fusion, and the founding, with Hannes ALFVÉN and others, of the study of plasma physics. The plasma of which stars are made is held together by the star’s gravita- tion, but to contain plasma in terrestrial laboratories w ould require powerful magnetic fields. A figure-of-eight chamber constructed for this purpose at Princeton’s Plas- ma Physics Laboratory was the forerunner of today’s experimental fusion reactors. In 1990 Spitzer witnessed the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope. He had proposed an orbiting telescope as early as 1946, since when he had fostered the idea with continual political encouragement and technical advice. He also directed the development of the COPERNICUS orbiting observatory. spokes Fe a tures discovered in Saturn’s B RING by VOYA GER . They take the form of radial shadows that are visible projected on the rings when viewed at low angles. They are thought to be the shadows of particles held above the plane of the rings by electrostatic forces. Since the discovery of the spokes, a reanalysis of drawings has shown that shadings have been recorded for over three centuries when conditions have been favourable; these are thought, in part, to represent observations of the spokes. sporadic meteor Completely random METEOR that does not belong to any recognized METEOR SHOWER , being produced instead by the atmospheric entry of debris from the general dust-cloud filling the inner Solar System. Most sporadics originate from long-defunct meteor streams, which have been dispersed by gr a vitational perturbations and solar radiation effects. Sporadic activity varies over the course of the year, being highest in the autumn months. Rates also show a diurnal va ri a tion, and are highest just before dawn. Depending on the time of night and time of year, between three and 12 sporadic meteors may be seen per hour. Spörer, Gustav Friedrich Wilhelm (1822–95) German solar astronomer who co-discovered the Sun’s differential rotation and first noticed the pattern of sunspot drift called SPÖRER ’ SLAW . He joined Potsdam Observatory in 1874, working with Johann ENCKE on the motions and distribution of sunspots. Spörer discovered, independent- ly of Richard CARRINGTON , the Sun’s differential rotation: spots near the Sun’s equator rotate faster than spots nearer its poles. By carefully plotting sunspot positions through- out the approximately 11-year solar cycle, Spörer discov- ered the patterns of sunspot migration collectively known as Spörer’s law. His study (1887) of historical records revealed a scarcity of sunspots between 1645 and 1715, a period now known as the Maunder minimum after E. W alter MAUNDER , who publicized it.

Square Kilometre Array (SKA) International project to design and ultimately build a centimetre-wavelength radio telescope with an effective collecting area of 1 sq km (0.4 sq mi). It will synthesize an aperture with a diameter of approximately 1000 km (625 mi). Such a telescope would probe the gaseous content of the very early Universe, complementing planned facilities in other wa v ebands such as the NEXT - GENERATION SPACE TELE - SCOPE .

SS Cygni star See UG EMINORUM STAR SS433 Ve ry unusual BINARY STAR system that lies at the centre of the supernova remnant W50 in AQ UILA . SS433 w as discovered in 1976 by the Ariel 5 X-ray satellite. It has strong EMISSION LINES from hydrogen and helium, and it was classified as object 433 in a catalogue of emission-line stars published (1977) by Bruce Stephenson and Nicholas Sanduleak (1933–90) of Case W estern Reserve University. The emission lines have broad and narrow components; the broad lines vary slightly with a period of 13.1 days, while the narrow lines va ry significantly in wavelength over a period of 164 days. It is generally accepted that SS433 is a binary system composed of a hot, massive star (of 10 to 20 solar masses) and a NEUTRON STAR (about 1.5 to 3 solar masses), which orbit each other every 13.1 days. The neutron star is prob- ably the stellar remnant from the SUPERNOVA that pro- duced W50. A stellar wind from the hot star produces the ‘stationary’ emission features. Matter is transferred from the massive star to the neutron star via an A CCRETION DISK . Not all the material reaches the surface of the neu- tron star, however, and some is ejected at high speed, probably by RADIATION PRESSURE , via two finely collimat- ed jets. The jets sweep around the sky every 164 days, producing the peculiar drifting spectral features that appear to make SS433 unique in astronomy. S star Member of a class of GIANT STARS with the same temperature range as MST ARS , but with absorption bands of zirconium oxide (ZrO) rather than titanium oxide (TiO). The overabundance of zirconium, as well as carbon and many heavy elements, is a result of convective mixing that brings by-products of nuclear reactions (principally those of hydrogen fusion, helium fusion and slow neutron capture) up to the stellar surfaces. S stars are the evolutionary intermediaries between M g iants and CARBON STARS . As M giants within a particular (but uncertain) mass range dredge carbon from below, and in the process become carbon stars, they pass through the S star state. While the atmospheres of M giants have more oxygen than carbon and carbon stars more carbon than oxygen, S stars have approximately equal amounts of the two. The carbon readily combines with the oxygen. What little free oxygen is left combines more readily with the enhanced zirconium (a slow neutron-capture prod- uct) to make zirconium oxide rather than titanium oxide. M stars with weak ZrO bands are assigned the intermedi- a te spectral type MS, while SC stars are intermediate between classic S stars and carbon stars. S stars often show hydrogen emission lines in their spectra and commonly pulsate as MIRA STARS , the bright- est being CHI CYGNI , which can peak at third magnitude.

It is customary to change the standard epoch every 50 years. standard model (1) Mathematical description of the SOLAR INTERIOR , based on a spherical Sun; it specifies the current variation with radius of density, temperature, luminosity and pressure.

In summer, the standard time is UT +1 h (British Summer Time). star Gaseous body that emits radiation generated within itself by nuclear FUSION . Mainly composed of hydrogen and helium, a star is a fine balancing act between the force produced within itself and the gravitational force. Many stars belong to binary or multiple systems. A star begins its life when the temperature and pres- sure within a collapsing cloud of interstellar material cause nuclear reactions to start. Below about 0.08 solar mass, conditions do not reach the point where nuclear fusion can occur (see BROWN DWARF ). Above about 150 solar masses, a star becomes unstable. The mass of a star has a g reat influence on its evolution (see STELLAR MASS ). A star’s evolution is dictated throughout its life by the bal- ancing act between gravitation and the energy produced by the nuclear reactions within the star. As a star evolves, its chemical composition changes. Stars belonging to CLOSE BINARY systems often have their evolution altered by interactions with their companion. The composition of stars is initially mainly hydrogen and helium, with a proportion of heavier elements, depending on the material from which it is forming. Stars produce energy within their core by nuclear fusion (see STELLAR INTERIORS ). The energy released has to force its wa y out through opaque gas, and at every point within the star the gravitational pull of the parts within exactly bal- ances the outward thrust and the star is in hydrostatic equilibrium ( see STELLAR ATMOSPHERE ). The internal structure of a star cannot be observed directly. The equations of stellar structure, on which com- puter models of the conditions within stars depend, are based on known laws of physics. Physical data such as mass, luminosity, radius, chemical composition and EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE can be measured for some stars, and the observed stellar conditions are satisfactorily pre- dicted by the equations of stellar structure. Stars can be broadly classified by their mass and stage of evolution and also by their effective temperature. A star’s SPECTRAL TYPE is an indication of its temperature, but it also gives information about its chemical composition. Stars are also classified by the percentage of heavy elements in their composition (see POPULATIONS , STELLAR ). The per- centage of heavy elements affects a star’s evolution. Many stars are observed to fluctuate in brightness (see V ARIABLE STARS ). These fluctuations can be due to a star belonging to an ECLIPSING BINARY system or a close binary system, or they may be a result of instabilities caused by its evolutionary phase (see TTA URI STARS , MIRA STARS ). starburst galaxy GALAXY that is undergoing a strong, temporary increase in its rate of star formation.

This is because many starbursts are quite dusty, and when the dust absorbs the ultraviolet and visible light from the massive stars, it radiates in the far-infrared (typically at 0.03–0.1 mm). Starbursts can be triggered by tidal interactions and mergers between galaxies, and the energy output of the massive stars and supernovae can be strong enough to drive a wind sweeping gas completely out of the galaxy (and terminating the starburst). Starburst galaxies are useful guides for the conditions expected in genuinely young galaxies in the early Universe, when star formation was more intense than is usually found in present-day galaxies. star clouds Parts of the MILKY WAY , especially in Sagittarius and its surrounding constellations, where the light from millions of faint stars combines to give the appearance of irregular faintly glowing clouds.

Stardust NASA Discovery programme spacecraft, launched in 1999 to rendezvous with the comet Wild 2 in 2004 January and to return to Earth in 2006 January with samples of dust from the comet’s coma. Stardust, which will also return with samples of INTERPLANETARY DUST , is equipped with two collectors, on either side of a mast, consisting of ultra-low-density silica aerogel material. One hundred particles of interplanetary dust between 0.1 and 1 \u0001 m and 1000 particles of comet dust larger than 15 \u0001 m will be returned to Earth. The collector will be deposited into a capsule, which will enter the Earth’s atmosphere as Stardust makes a return to its home planet, to be recovered in Utah. The samples will be analysed at the Planetary Material Curatorial Facility at the NASA Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Star of Bethlehem Celestial portent of the birth of Jesus Christ, mentioned in the biblical book of Matthew. The precise nature of the Star of Bethlehem has been of great interest to Christians and astronomers alike. Many books and articles have been written on the subject, some authors regarding it as a mythical or miraculous event and others supposing that it was a real astronomical phenome- non that ordinary mortals could have seen. The first problem encountered when trying to relate the star to a real astronomical event is that the precise year of the nativity is uncertain, though it is believed to have been between 7 BC and 1 BC . A census of allegiance to Augustus Caesar, which may have been the census men- tioned in the Bible, took place in 3 BC . Numerous astro- nomical events such as planetary conjunctions and conjunctions of planets with stars occurred during those years; several comets and a nova were also recorded. Although there is no general agreement on the precise events that guided the Magi on their path to Bethlehem, one theory is that successive conjunctions of Jupiter and Venus in 3 BC August and 2 BC June were the ‘stars’ that led them westwards. Around 2 BC December 25, the plan- et Jupiter seemed to stand still among the stars because of its change from (apparent) retrograde to prograde motion. Seen from Jerusalem, it would have appeared to be above Bethlehem. star streaming Grouping of the motions of individual stars, relative to their neighbours, around two opposite preferred directions in space. The effect was discovered by Jacobus KAPTEYN ,w ho made statistical studies showing that, in general, the peculiar motions of stars (that is relative to the average motion of neighbouring stars) appear to be in one of two directions in space, rather than moving in random directions. The phenomenon is caused by the rotation of the Galaxy and many later studies of distances and spatial arrangements of the stars in the Milky Way arose from this discovery. star trailing Extension of the images of stars into arcs caused by the rotation of the Earth, and hence the move- ment of stars across the sky, on a photograph taken with a stationary camera or telescope.

See also RETROGRADE MOTION steady-state theory Theory, originated by Hermann BONDI , Thomas GOLD , Fred HOYLE , Jayant NARLIKAR and others, designed to satisfy the PERFECT COSMOLOGICAL PRINCIPLE , which states that the local properties of the Universe – when averaged over some suitable distance – are the same from whatever point in space and time they are determined. This principle is consistent with the model derived by Willem DE SITTER from Einstein’s field equations. The steady-state universe is expanding, but a constant density of matter is maintained by invoking CONTINUOUS CREATION of matter at all places and all times by a so-called C-field. It avoids the problem, associated with the BIG BANG THEORY , of an initial SINGULARITY – a fixed starting point and, apparently, some instrument of creation. F or nearly two decades, steady state and Big Bang w ere rival theories. There were two main reasons for the demise of the steady-state theory: the discovery of the COSMIC MICROWAVE BACKGROUND in 1965, and the realization that galaxies have evolved over time, neither of which it could readily explain. Its lasting importance was the stimulus it provided to astrophysics and cosmology, leading, for example, to the first detailed work on NUCLEOSYNTHESIS . Ironically, the steady-state universe strongly resembles some versions of INFLATION , the model proposed to account for the initial rapid expansion that followed the Big Bang. Stebbins, Joel (1878–1966) American astronomer who pioneered photoelectric photometry. Stebbins spent most of his career (1918–48) at the University of Wis- consin’s Washburn Observatory. In 1910 he attached a primitive photocell to a telescope and discovered the sec- ondary minimum in the light curve of the eclipsing bina- ry star Algol. Stebbins devised methods for reducing the huge amounts of data generated by his photoelectric instruments, which he used to study ‘regular’ stars, vari- ous types of variable stars, the solar corona, globular clusters and galaxies. With Albert Edward Whitford (1905–?1983) he developed increasingly sensitive photo- electric cells that eventually supplanted photography as a means of measuring star magnitudes. The superiority of the photoelectric method (photographic emulsions are usually overly sensitive to either blue or red light) allowed Stebbins and his colleagues to quantify the ‘red- dening’ effects of interstellar matter and to adjust stellar magnitudes accordingly.

It was formulated by the Austrian physicist J oseph Stefan (1853–93) and by Ludwig BOLTZMANN . It takes the form F = \u0001\u0004 2 T 4 , where F is the flux, \u0001 is the STEFAN – BOLTZMANN CONSTANT , \u0004 is the refractive index of the medium and T is the temperature. stellar association See ASSOCIATION , STELLAR stellar atmosphere Atmosphere of a STAR ; it consists of the layers from which radiation is directly observed. Stellar atmospheres comprise plasmas composed of many types of particles, including atoms, ions, free electrons, molecules and sometimes dust grains. The inner boundary of a stellar atmosphere is with the stellar interior, about which no direct information is available, while the outer boundary is taken to be where it merges with the interstellar medium. Although the atmosphere of a star can extend a long wa y out into space, the majority of radiation emitted from it comes from a relatively thin layer called the PHOTOS - PHERE . Generally, a stellar photosphere is about one thou- sandth of the star’s radius, although hotter stars have relatively thicker photospheres. The photosphere is the innermost part of a stellar atmosphere. The outer layer of a stellar atmosphere is the STELLAR WIND , a region where the outflow velocities are compara- ble to or larger than the local speed of sound. In a few stars there is a further, more remote layer: some very y oung stars may still be enveloped by the material from which they formed. The structure of the atmosphere above the photos- phere differs markedly between cool and hot stars. Cool stars, defined as stars with an EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE of less than about 7500 K, have been observed to have a CHROMOSPHERE and CORONA similar to that of the Sun. The atmospheres of cool stars are very complex and are characterized by increasing temperature with altitude in their outer layers. The mechanism causing this tempera- ture increase is not fully understood, but heat conduction becomes an important process in regions of low density such as in stellar coronae. Energy may also be transported by MAGNETOHYDRODYNAMIC or acoustic waves, which are responsible for heating the corona non-radiatively. These wa v es are generated by strong, geometrically complex magnetic fields, which in turn are created by a dynamo effect in the convection zone beneath the photosphere. Coronal heating is believed to be the source of the X-rays detected from these stars. The high coronal temperature in cool MAIN - SEQUENCE stars results in a large gas pressure, which induces a weak pressure-driven stellar wind. Fast, but very tenuous, this wind is so optically thin throughout that it cannot be detected spectroscopically; it is often not included in the a tmosphere of such stars. In evolved cool stars, however, a much denser wind is observed. These stars have low sur- face gravity so the mass-loss rate of a coronal wind is larg- er. In addition, other mechanisms, such as RADIATION PRESSURE on dust grains formed in the outer layers or acceleration in pulsating layers, become efficient drivers of the stellar wind. Strong, fast winds typify the atmospheres of early-type main-sequence stars (O and early B-type) and O, B and A-type SUPERGIANTS . These fast, supersonic winds are dri- v en by radiation pressure generated by absorption of pho- tons. The X-ray emission detected in O and early B-type stars is attributed to shock-heated material in the wind and not to the corona. The winds of red supergiants are slow. stellar diameters Stars range in size from having diameters of a few tens of kilometres ( NEUTRON STARS ) to several hundreds of millions of kilometres ( SUPERGIANTS ). Generally the sizes of stars are expressed in terms of the solar radius ( R o . ). The diameter or radius of a star, along with its mass, LUMINOSITY and EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE , helps to deter- mine its position on the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM . When a star’s radius is very large or very small, its effect on the luminosity can dominate over the effect due to temperature. A star’s diameter can be measured directly if its angular diameter and distance from Earth can be mea- sured. Measuring the angular diameters of stars directly, however, is difficult because of the large distances involved. The diameters of some stars can been measured when they are occulted by the Moon. Optical INTERFEROMETRY can also be used, and as the resolution of interferometers improves, the diameters of smaller stars can be measured. Another technique used is SPECKLE INTERFEROMETRY . The diameters of some stars can be obtained indirectly, for example if they are mem- stationary point 388 S S AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:24 pm Page 388"},{"pageNumber":398,"pageContent":"stellar interior bers of ECLIPSING BINARY systems. If the effective temper- a ture ( T eff ) can be measured from its spectrum, and a v alue of its luminosity ( L ) determined from its apparent brightness and distance, then a value of the star’s radius ( R ) can be inferred from L =4 \u0001 R 2 \u0002 T 2 eff , where \u0002 is the STEFAN – BOLTZMANN CONSTANT . Some stellar diameters have been obtained when a star is involved in MICROLENSING events. stellar evolution Development of a STAR ov er its lifetime. The theory of stellar evolution revolves around mathematical models of stellar interiors and current laws of physics. It gives a fairly detailed account of the evolution of any particular star, and it can be checked by observation of stars at each of the predicted phases. The evolutionary stages of stars are represented on the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM (HR diagram). Timescales for evolution lie between hundreds of thousands, and thousands of millions of years; hence the evolution of a particular star cannot be directly observed, although very occasionally changes in a star over the course of a human lifetime can be observed as it passes through a rapid phase, as with FG SAGITTAE . The evolution of a star in a close binary system can be affected when mass transfer occurs from its companion, because changing the star’s mass alters conditions in its interior. Stars form from a dense interstellar cloud known as a GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUD . A large cloud is able to col- lapse under its own gravity and will subsequently frag- ment into several hundred smaller clouds, each of which contracts further and heats up to become a PROTOSTAR . Protostars are very red and can be observed at infrared wa v elengths; they are found in regions of our Galaxy where there is an abundance of gas and dust. The progress of a PRE - MAIN - SEQUENCE STAR on the HR dia- g ram is represented by the HAYASHI and HENYEY tracks. A protostar will continue to collapse under gravity until its centre is hot enough (about 15 million degrees K) for nuclear FUSION reactions to commence. As it collapses, its outer layers fall in to take up a normal star-like form and it becomes bluer in colour. TTA URI STARS are low-mass stars in this final phase. Once nuclear fusion has commenced in the core of a star, the star adopts a stable structure, with its gravity being balanced by the heat from its centre (the photons created in the nuclear fusion reactions diffuse outwards, exerting RADIATION PRESSURE ). The controlled nuclear fusion reaction is the fusion of hydrogen atom nuclei (pro- tons) to form helium nuclei. This period is known as the MAIN - SEQUENCE phase of a star’s life; it is the longest phase in the life of a star, and consequently at any particu- lar moment most stars are in the main-sequence period of their existence. The Sun has a main-sequence lifetime of some ten thousand million years, of which only a half has expired. Less massive stars are redder and fainter than the Sun and stay on the main sequence longer; more massive stars are bluer and brighter and have a shorter lifetime. As a star ages, the composition of its core changes from mainly hydrogen to mainly helium, causing it to become ve ry slightly brighter and bluer; on the main sequence its position moves slightly upwards and to the right of its zero-age position ( see ZERO - AG E MAIN SEQUENCE ). The internal structure of a main-sequence star depends on its mass. Massive stars have a convective core and a radiative mantle (see CONVECTION and RADIATIVE TRANSFER ). Low-mass stars, including the Sun, have a radiative core and a convective mantle. The stirring that occurs in the core of a massive star causes it to have a uni- form composition within that core, which affects the details of the next phase of evolution. Eventually, the hydrogen supply in the core of the star r uns out. With the central energy source removed, the core will collapse under gravity, and heat itself up further, until hydrogen fusion is able to take place in a spherical shell surrounding the core (hydrogen SHELL BURNING ). As this change occurs, the outer layers of the star expand considerably, and the star becomes a RED GIANT , or in the case of the most massive stars, a red SUPERGIANT . The speed of evolution to the red giant phase depends on the mass. A low-mass star changes gradually to become a red g iant as the hydrogen exhaustion spreads outward from its centre. A high-mass star evolves quickly to become a red g iant because its whole convective core runs out of hydro- gen at the same time. Giant stars are sufficiently cool to have a spectral type of K or M. While it is a red giant, the star’s central temperature will reach 100 million K, and the fusion of helium to car- bon will commence in the core. In the case of low-mass stars, the onset of helium fusion is sudden (the HELIUM FLASH ), and the star reduces its radius to become a bluer b ut fainter HORIZONTAL BRANCH STAR as observed in GLOBULAR CLUSTERS ; it may subsequently return to being a red giant. In high-mass stars, the onset of helium fusion occurs more gradually, and the star remains a red giant. The evolution of a star beyond the helium fusion phase is more difficult to calculate with certainty. When the heli- um fuel in the core has been converted into carbon, the core of the star will again collapse and heat up. In the case of a low-mass star, the central temperature will not rise high enough to initiate carbon fusion, and the outer layers of the star will contract, then gradually cool down, so that the star becomes a WHITE DWARF . It is likely that before a white dwarf cools appreciably, it throws off its outer layers in the form of a PLANETARY NEBULA . White dwarf stars are plentiful, but they are difficult to observe because of their faintness. It is believed that white dwarfs cool forever, becoming BLACK DWARFS – mere cinders of stars. In the case of a high-mass star, the contraction of the carbon core will lead to further episodes of nuclear fusion, during which the star will remain very bright. Many of these stars fluctuate in brightness as MIRA STARS . At this stage the internal chemistry can change, or gas of a differ- ent chemical mix deep within can rise to the surface by convection. These stars may then appear as CARBON STARS (C stars). Most of these objects are extremely red and thus rather faint. Once a star reaches the point where no more nuclear fusion can occur, it will collapse to become a white dwarf, unless the core exceeds the CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT of 1.4 solar masses, in which case further contraction occurs, producing a NEUTRON STAR . When the core is composed of elements close to iron in the periodic table, no further fusion is possible. At this point, it is most likely that the core will collapse explosively, and the star will throw off its outer layers in a SUPERNOVA explosion, becoming for a few w eeks bright enough to outshine the galaxy in which it is situated. The dead core of the massive star will remain as a neutron star or, if the core is massive enough, it will col- lapse further to become a stellar BLACK HOLE . stellar interferometer OPTICAL INTERFEROMETER used to measure the angular diameter of stars or the angular separation of the components of double stars. An interfer- ometer operates by splitting and re-combining a beam of light using mirrors in order to examine the INTERFERENCE fringes produced by the re-combined beam. Because a star image is a disk, not a point source, it is possible to adjust the separation of the two mirrors, d , until the fringes disappear, bright fringes from one side of the stel- lar disk coinciding with dark fringes from the other. At this point, d = 1.22 \u0003 / \u0004 , where \u0003 is the wavelength of light and \u0004 the angle subtended by the stellar disk. stellar interior Internal structure of a STAR . Knowledge of stellar interiors is gained by observing external properties and formulating a stellar model using known laws of physics to explain the properties observed. The equations that are used to construct models of stellar interiors are known as the equations of stellar structure. The determination of the density, temperature, com- position and luminosity at any point within a star requires the solutions to the conservation laws of energy, mass and momentum at that point. Different conditions exist in stars of different mass and at different stages of evolution, 389 S S AST ENCY PHI fin 11/4/02 7:24 pm Page 389"},{"pageNumber":399,"pageContent":"the main differences being the form of energy transport and the composition. CONVECTION and RADIATIVE TRANSFER are the principal means of energy transport in stellar interiors. For MAIN - SEQUENCE stars below about 1.5 solar masses, the tempera- ture gradient within the core is too low for convection to occur. Energy transfer within these stars is primarily by radiative transfer, with convection occurring in shallow regions near the surface known as convective shells. More massive main-sequence stars have convective cores. Most stars at a stable point in their evolution are assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, whereby the forces at any point within a star balance and the internal pressures counteract the gravitational pull. For main- sequence stars the internal pressure is a combination of gas and radiation pressure. For evolved stars like WHITE DW ARFS and NEUTRON STARS the internal pressure is pro- duced by the DEGENERATE MATTER in their cores. stellar mass The mass of a STAR is a very important factor in its evolution and determines its basic structure and lifetime. Stellar masses are generally expressed in terms of the Sun’s mass (M o . ). Stellar masses range from 0.08 solar mass to about 150 solar masses. Below 0.08 solar mass, temperatures at the core do not become sufficiently high for nuclear FUSION to begin. Stellar-like objects with mass less than 0.08 solar mass are called BROWN DWARFS . Upper theoretical limitations suggest that stars with masses above about 150 solar masses are unstable because of the effect of RADIATION PRESSURE . The most massive MAIN - SEQUENCE stars observed are within the R136 clus- ter in the 30 Doradus Nebula of the LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD . These stars are around 155 solar masses; they show signs of high mass loss similar to that observed in W OLF – RAYET STARS . Stellar masses can be determined directly from BINARY SYSTEMS . They can also be deter- mined indirectly, using stellar models, if a star’s LUMINOSI - TY , EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE and distance are known. According to the V OGT – R USSELL THEOREM , a star’s properties and evolution are determined by its initial mass and chemical composition. Since the composition of stars va r ies relatively little, it is the initial mass that dictates basic structure and evolution. Higher-mass stars have shorter lifespans because the higher temperatures at their cores enable them to burn their fuel quicker and thus evolve faster. See also INITIAL MASS FUNCTION ; MASS – LUMINOSI - TY RELATION ; STELLAR EVOLUTION stellar nomenclature System for assigning designations to stars. The brightest stars have proper names originally given to them by Greek, Roman or Arab astronomers, for example Sirius, Capella and Aldebaran. In addition to any proper name, stars down to around 5th magnitude within each constellation are identified by a letter or number followed by the name of the constellation in the genitive (possessive) form ( see constellations table, pages 94–95). The brightest stars are indicated by Greek letters, as in \u0001 (Alpha) Lyrae or \u0002 (Epsilon) Eridani. These letters are known as Bayer letters because they we re assigned by Johann BAYER in his star atlas Uranometria of 1603, usually in order of brightness. Stars that lack Bayer letters are prefixed by a number, as in 61 Cygni. These are known as Flamsteed numbers because they were assigned to stars charted in John FLAMSTEED ’s Historia coelestis britannica , in order of right ascension (RA). Capital and lower-case roman letters are also used, particularly for stars in the southern hemisphere. V ARIABLE STARS have their own system of nomenclature. F ainter stars (and deep-sky objects) are identified according to their listing in any of a number of other cata- logues, by the catalogue’s abbreviation followed by its des- ignation in the catalogue. The designation scheme can be a single sequence of numbers (often in order of RA), as in HD 74156 or NGC 6543, or the numbering can be based on zones, as in BD \u0003 31 643. Modern designations tend to use truncated coordinates: for example, PSR 0531 \u0003 21 is the designation of a pulsar having its 1950.0 coordinates RA 05 h 31 m , dec. \u0003 21º; while in PSR J0534 \u0003 2200, the ‘J’ indicates truncated 2000.0 coordinates. A list of the vari- ous designation letters is in a Dictionary of Nomenclature of Celestial Objects maintained under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union (IAU). There are commercial organizations from which star names can be bought. Although this is not illegal, and individuals might like to name a star after a loved one, such star names have absolutely no status and are not rec- ognized by the IAU. stellar wind Stream of charged particles, mostly PROTONS and ELECTRONS , that is continually emitted from the surface of a STAR , including the Sun (see SOLAR WIND ). Y oung stars evolving towards the MAIN SEQUENCE have powerful stellar winds, sometimes up to a thousand times stronger than the SOLAR WIND . These winds crash into the surrounding gas clouds and ionize them, pro- ducing expanding shock waves in the interstellar medi- um. While on the main sequence, high-mass stars lose a significant fraction of their mass to the interstellar medi- um. A star of around 120 solar masses at birth could lose as much as 50 solar masses of material during its main- sequence lifetime. A star of around 60 solar masses at birth could lose around 12 solar masses. Old stars evolv- ing off the main sequence to become RED GIANTS also have strong stellar winds. Stephano One of the several small outer satellites of URANUS ; it was discovered in 1999 by J.J. Kavelaars and others. Stephano is about 20 km (12 mi) in size. It takes 674 days to circuit the planet, at an average distance of 7.98 million km (4.96 million mi). It has a RETROGRADE orbit (inclination near 144º) with a moderate eccentricity (0.228).

Steward Observatory Major US astronomical institu- tion operated by University of Arizona, Tucson. It incorpo- rates the University’s Department of Astronomy. During the 1980s, the observatory pioneered novel techniques for manufacturing large telescope mirrors, and its Mirror Lab- oratory has now produced optics for some of the world’s biggest telescopes. Today, the instruments operated with the participation of the Steward Observatory include the 6.5-m (256-in.) telescope of the MMT OBSERVATORY , the two 6.5-m MAGELLAN TELESCOPES and the 10-m (33-ft) HEINRICH HERTZ TELESCOPE .

Its actual diameter is about 130 times that of the Solar System. Stjerneborg Second observatory constructed by Tycho BRAHE in about1584; the name means ‘Castle of the Stars’. Its observing chambers were mainly below ground level to provide stability and were covered by rotating roofs equipped with openable shutters.

Stony-irons are subdivided into two big groups, MESOSIDERITES and P ALLASITES , which have very different origins and histories. stony meteorites METEORITES that are made from the same elements as terrestrial rocks, dominantly silicon, o xygen, iron, magnesium, calcium and aluminium. Like terrestrial rocks, stony meteorites are assem- blages of minerals, such as pyroxene, olivine and plagio- clase, but unlike terrestrial rocks they also contain metal and sulphides. Stony meteorites are subdivided into two big groups, CHONDRITES and A CHONDRITES . The former have not melted since aggregation of their original com- ponents, and thus they are unfractionated with respect to the Sun. The latter formed from melts on their various parent bodies.

There is an a tmospheric temperature minimum at the tropopause, above which the temperature at first remains steady with increasing height. Above 20 km (12 mi), it begins to increase, reaching a a maximum of about 273 K at an altitude of 50 km (31 mi), which marks the stratopause, the top of the stratosphere. The heating is primarily through the absorption of solar ultraviolet radiation by ozone. The ozone layer (sometimes called the ozonosphere) lies at an altitude of between about 15 and 50 km (9 and 31 mi) and is essentially identical with the stratosphere. The highest concentration of ozone occurs at a height of about 20–25 km (12–16 mi).

Strömgren, Bengt George Daniel (1908–87) Danish astrophysicist, born in Sweden, who explained the nature of ionized hydrogen (HII) gas clouds that surround hot stars. He succeeded his father, Svante Elis Strömgren (1870–1947), as director of Copenhagen Observatory (1940), and later worked at Yerkes and McDonald Obser- va tories and Princeton University’s Institute for Advanced Study. Strömgren became particularly interested in the astrophysics of the Orion Nebula and Milky Way’s other HII regions. He developed theoretical models of what w ere later called STRÖMGREN SPHERES , which he used to estimate the size and density of a hydrogen cloud by mea- suring the luminosity of its exciting star. These models allowed Strömgren and others, especially William W. MORGAN , to map the spiral structure of the Milky Way. Strömgren sphere Vo lume of ionized gas around a hot star ( see also HII REGION ). The region will only be spherical when the interstellar gas in which it forms is of uniform density. A Strömgren sphere has a definite size that is reached when the number of ultraviolet photons emitted by the star exactly balances the number of ionizations occurring in the gas. The radii of Strömgren spheres were first calculated by Bengt STRÖMGREN ; they range from 1 to 100 l.y. for O5 stars (within high and low density HI REGIONS respectively), and from 0.1 to 15 l.y. for B0 stars. Struve family German–Russian family that produced astronomers of note across four generations. As a youth, (Friedrich Georg) Wilhelm von STRUVE (1793–1864) left Germany for Latvia, later moving to Russia to establish PULKOVO OBSERVATORY . One of his sons was Otto (Wil- helm) Struve (1819–1905), known to historians as Otto I Struve. Like his father, whom he succeeded as director at Pulkovo in 1862, Otto studied double stars, discovering around 500 of them. He determined an accu- rate value for the rate of precession, taking into account the motion of the Sun with respect to nearby stars, which he measured. (Karl) Hermann Struve (1854–1920), who became director of Berlin Observatory (1904), and (Gustav Wilhelm) Ludwig Struve (1858–1920), direc- tor of Kharkhov Observatory from 1894, were sons of Otto, while Georg Struve (1886–1933) was a son of Hermann; they all studied the Solar System. Otto Ludwig STRUVE (1897–1963), a son of Ludwig, emigrated to the USA in 1921 and became a naturalized American. He is known to historians as Otto II Struve. Struve, (Friedrich Georg) Wilhelm von (1793–1864) German astronomer, the first major observer and cata- loguer of double stars, and one of the first to measure a stellar parallax. He founded the most distinguished of astronomical dynasties – the STRUVE FAMILY . In 1808 he left his homeland to escape conscription into the occupy- ing Napoleonic army, settling in Dorpat (modern Tartu, in Estonia), becoming director of Dorpat Observatory in 1817. From 1835 he helped to establish PULKOVO OBSER - VAT O RY , which he directed until his retirement in 1862. In 1824 Struve commenced an extensive survey of double and multiple stars with the 9 \u0001 \u0002 -inch (240-mm) f /18 Dorpat Refractor, made by Joseph FRAUNHOFER and equipped with a clock drive and a filar micrometer – the largest and best telescope of its day. His measurements of position angles and separations, comparable with modern ones in their precision, were published in a catalogue (1827) and two later supplements, which between them listed 3112 doubles, of which 2343 were discovered by Struve himself. The designations from these catalogues, prefixed by \u0001 (the Greek capital S) are still in use. The collected results were published in Stellarum duplicium et multiplicium Mensurae Micrometricae per magnum Fraun- hoferi tubum in Specula Dorpatensi (1837). Between 1835 and 1838 Struve made careful measure- ments of Vega, seeking to detect a parallax. He completed his analysis shortly before Friedrich Wilhelm BESSEL had done the same for the star 61 Cygni, but Bessel was the first to publish his result. Struve obtained a parallax for V ega of 0 \u0002 .262, equivalent to a distance of 12.5 l.y., half the present-day value. His other achievements included the finding, in 1846, that starlight is absorbed in the galac- tic plane, which he correctly attributed to the presence of interstellar matter. Struve, Otto Ludwig (1897–1963) Russian-American astrophysicist, great-grandson of Wilhelm Struve, who applied spectroscopy to the study of binary and variable stars, stellar rotation and interstellar matter. Born in Rus- sia, his work at Kharkov Observatory, where his father, Ludwig Struve, was director, was halted by the turmoil following World War I, and in 1921 he moved to Yerkes Observatory, becoming a naturalized American in 1927. He was director of the observatory and professor of astro- physics at the University of Chicago (1932–47), and later became the first director of McDonald Observatory (1939–50) and of the National Radio Astronomy Obser- va tory (1960–62). Struve’s most important contribution (1929) was to show, with Boris Petrovich Gerasimovich (1889–1937), that interstellar matter pervades the whole Galaxy, and is not localized as had been thought. In 1937 he detected interstellar hydrogen.

The telescope’s name is Japanese for ‘Pleiades’. Construction began in 1991, and the tele- scope became operational in 2000 with a sea-level base facility in nearby Hilo. The Subaru is notable for its A CTIVE OPTICS , sophisticated drive systems and cylindrical dome, which helps to suppress local atmospheric turbu- lence. It also has four foci and an auto-exchanger system for instruments at its prime focus, giving it a reputation as the Rolls-Royce of 8–10-metre telescopes. subdwarf DW ARF STAR of class F, G or K with low metal abundance; it appears below the normal MAIN SEQUENCE in the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM or colour–magnitude diagram. The term is misleading because subdwarfs are not below the standard main sequence but to the left of it. The low metal content yields spectra that make subdwarfs look too early for their temperatures; it decreases the atmospheric opacities to make them seem too hot and blue for their masses. Subdwarfs tend towards high velocities and are considered to be Population II halo stars. subdwarf (sd) Any member of a group of stars that are less luminous by one to two magnitudes than MAIN - SEQUENCE stars of the same SPECTRAL TYPE ; subdwarfs are of luminosity class VI.

Submillimeter Telescope Observatory (SMTO) See HEINRICH HERTZ TELESCOPE submillimetre-wave astronomy Study of extraterrestrial objects that emit in the region of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM between 350 \u0001 m and 1 mm. It was originally regarded as part of the radio region or the infrared region – part of the radio region because it was the shortest non-optical wavelength that could be observed from the ground. Alternatively, it can be regarded as very far-infrared because the instruments used to detect submillimetre radiation are very similar to those used for INFRARED ASTRONOMY . The instruments must be cooled with liquid helium, and the telescopes must be at high, very dry sites because atmospheric water v apour easily absorbs submillimetre radiation. Submillimetre-wave astronomy focuses on molecular clouds, star-forming regions, cold dust and molecules. Molecules and cold dust are seen in planetary nebulae and galaxies, and many other types of astronomical object. A far-infrared and submillimetre satellite (the HERSCHEL SPACE OBSERVATORY ) will be launched in 2007. There are several submillimetre observatories, but the JAMES CLERK MAXWELL TELESCOPE (JCMT) on Hawaii has made a significant impact in the area of submillimetre astronomy, particularly with the array instrument SCUBA. High-redshift galaxies in the HUBBLE DEEP FIELD have been found to emit strongly in the submillimetre. Cold dust disks around young and main-sequence stars (such as Vega and \u0002 Eridani) have been resolved by JCMT. Spectral emission lines from higher energy levels of molecules can be detected in the submillimetre (and compared with those in the millimetre wave region), so that the warmer and denser regions of star-forming clouds can be observed, probing for the initial stages of the col- lapse, both for high-mass and low-mass stars. The submil- limetre can be used to map cold dust and molecules in the direction of the centre of our Galaxy. subsolar point Poin t on the surface of a body in the Solar System, particularly the Earth, at which the Sun w ould be at the ZENITH at any given moment.

Sun MAIN - SEQUENCE star of spectral type G2; it is the cen- tral body of the SOLAR SYSTEM around which all the planets, asteroids, comets and meteoroids revolve in their orbits. The Sun’s light and heat are essential for life on Earth. The Sun’s energy source is the nuclear FUSION of h ydrogen into helium, taking place in the CORE , which occupies about 25% of the solar radius. SOLAR NEUTRINOS produced by these NUCLEAR REACTIONS are detected at Earth. The structure and dynamics of the SOLAR INTERIOR are studied by HELIOSEISMOLOGY . A radiative zone sur- rounds the core, and a convective zone occupies the outer 28.7% of the solar radius. The visible disk of the Sun is called the PHOTOSPHERE .

See also KREUTZ SUNGRAZER sunspot Dark, temporary concentration of strong magnetic fields detected in the white light of the Sun’s PHOTOSPHERE . Sunspots are the most visible manifestations of A CTIVE REGIONS , which also include features such as FA CULAE and PLAGES . The central magnetic field of a sunspot is vertical, and typically has a strength of 2000 to 4000 Gauss. Most sunspots have a central dark umbra and a lighter, grey surrounding region, called the penumbra, although either feature can exist without the other. A sunspot is cooler than the surrounding material and therefore appears darker. The effective temperature of the sunspot umbra is about 4000 K, compared with 5780 K in the neighbouring photosphere. The penumbra consists of linear bright and dark elements known as filaments, which extend radially from the umbra if the spot is more or less circular; the penumbra in complex spot groups may be more irregular. Sunspots vary in size from PORES about 1000 km (600 mi) in diameter to about 1 million km (600,000 mi). The largest spots become visible to the protected naked eye (under no circumstances should an observer look directly at the Sun without using an approved, safe filter). The duration of sunspots varies from a few hours to a few we eks, or months for the very biggest. The number and location of sunspots vary over the SOLAR CYCLE . The number of sunspots is described by the RELATIVE SUNSPOT NUMBER , and their locations change over the c ycle in accordance with SPÖRER ’ SLAW , shown graphically as the BUTTERFLY DIAGRAM . Heliographic latitudes and longitudes are measured relative to a standard reference frame defined by the CARRINGTON ROTATIONS . Sunspots usually occur in pairs or groups of opposite magnetic polarity that move in unison across the face of the Sun as it rotates. See also EVERSHED EFFECT ; WILSON EFFECT supercluster Extensive grouping of galaxies which may include multiple clusters as well as surrounding smaller g roups and extensive regions of enhanced galaxy density in the forms of sheets or filaments. We are in the Local Supercluster, centered on the VIRGO CLUSTER about 60 million l.y. away, and occupying a flattened volume roughly perpendicular to the plane of the Milky Way. As is typical, the Local Supercluster is still growing because its dynamical influence has time to be felt over larger and larger regions, so that eventually the LOCAL GROUP of galaxies is expected to fall into the supercluster centre. Other well-known superclusters include the Shapley Supercluster, which is related to the GREAT ATTRACTOR ; the Perseus–Pisces Supercluster, which includes seven r ich clusters plus outlying filaments, together spanning more than 40º in our sky and about 1 billion l.y. in space; and the Coma/Abell 1367 Supercluster, which is part of the so-called Great Wall of galaxies seen almost edge-on about 300 million l.y. away. The mass of a supercluster can be estimated from non- Hubble distance estimates of outlying objects on its near and far borders, which may reveal the characteristic pattern of infall under the supercluster’s influence. At their outskirts, superclusters blend into the overall LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE of clumps, walls and filaments of galaxies which spans the observable Universe, on scales of up to 1 billion l.y. Their existence is important for cosmology, since enough time must have elapsed for them to have collected such a massive concentration of material, and the mass distribution in the early Universe must have been uneven enough to start the process of accumulation. supergiant Largest and most luminous star known.

The cells are outlined by the magnetic network in the CHROMOSPHERE , the boundaries of which contain concentrations of magnetic fields and SPICULES . superior conjunction P oint in the orbit of one of the INFERIOR PLANETS at which it lies on the far side of the Sun, as seen from Earth, and the three bodies are in alignment. CONJUNCTION occurs when two bodies have the same celestial longitude as viewed from the Earth. For an inferior planet, this can also occur when it is on the same side of the Sun as the Earth. At this point it is said to be at INFERIOR CONJUNCTION . See diagram at CONJUNCTION superior planet Te rm that is used to describe any planet with an orbit that lies beyond that of the Earth; the superior planets are Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. superluminal expansion Apparent faster-than-light effect. Special relativity asserts that massive particles can never reach or exceed the speed of light. Yet, radio lobes seen in distant radio galaxies and quasars have been measured to be separating from the central source at v elocities exceeding the speed of light. This faster-than- light or ‘superluminal’ expansion is merely an effect of the finite speed of light that occurs in things that are moving close to the speed of light and very close to the line of sight. Time dilation effects coupled with the time for light to travel between the reference object (the quasar or galaxy core) and the emitting object (the knot in the jet that is moving close to the speed of light) can cause the distant observer to overestimate the speed by a large fraction. supermassive black holes BLACK HOLES that are thought to reside in the nuclei of galaxies and quasars and to contain 10 6 to 10 9 times the mass of the Sun. These black holes are a million to a billion times more massive than black holes that result from stellar evolution. It is not clear how they form in galactic centres, but the evidence for their existence is very strong. The direct evidence for the existence of supermassive black holes comes from observations of high-velocity gas clouds orbiting the centres of radio galaxies. The gravitational potential necessary to bind these clouds in orbit requires 10 6 to 10 8 solar masses contained within a very small region of space. The mass density required assures that the supermassive object would immediately collapse to a black hole if it were not one already. Indirect evidence for supermassive black holes is also found in observations of quasars, which suggest that a large amount of energy is generated within a volume the size of our Solar System. The only energy generation mechanism efficient enough to accomplish this is the conversion of gravitational energy into light by a supermassive black hole. supermassive star Ve ry rare star with mass of the order of 100 solar masses and above. It is not known if there is an upper limit for STELLAR MASSES , but some estimates suggest an upper limit of 440 solar masses. The most massive MAIN - SEQUENCE stars observed are within the R136 cluster in the 30 Doradus Nebula of the LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD . They are around 155 solar masses. See also ETA CARINAE ; S DORADUS STAR supernova Stellar explosion that involves the disruption of virtually an entire STAR . Supernovae are classified by their spectra into two broad types, Type I and Type II, according to the presence or absence of hydrogen in their spectra. Type I supernovae have no hydrogen in their spectra, whereas Type II do. It is now known that the cause of supernovae is not determined by the presence or lack of hydrogen in the spectra, thus further categorization has been made. There are two basic models for the cause of super- novae. The ‘core collapse supernovae’ are massive stars that have exhausted the nuclear fuel in their cores. Howev- er, because the mass of the core reaches beyond the CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT further core collapse occurs until neutron degeneracy pressure sets in, and the outer atmos- phere is thrown off as a result of shock waves. Other supernovae are thought to occur in CLOSE BINARY systems in which a WHITE DWARF is sent over the Chandrasekhar limit by MASS TRANSFER from its companion. T ype Ia supernovae appear in all types of galaxies but are less frequent in the spiral arms of spiral galaxies. They have elements such as magnesium, silicon, sulphur and calcium in their spectra near maximum light, and iron later on. The light-curve of a Type Ia supernova shows an initial rise over about two weeks, then a more gradual decay over timescales of months. A Type Ia supernova is thought to be the explosion, as a result of mass transfer, of an old, low-mass, long-lived star in a binary system. As T ype Ia supernovae are so bright, they have been used to estimate distances to faraway galaxies. T ype II supernovae do not appear in elliptical galaxies, b ut instead occur mostly in the spiral arms of spiral galax- ies or sometimes in irregular galaxies. They show ordinary stellar abundances in their spectra. The light-curve of a T ype II supernova rises to a peak in a week or so, remains constant for about a month, then drops suddenly over a few weeks, returning to obscurity over a timescale of months. A Type II supernova is believed to be the result of 395 S \u0001 supernova Elements heavier than iron cannot be formed in normal stellar fusion, and supernovae are thought to be the mechanism that produces them. Lighter elements are also created during supernovae – this image shows the presence of silicon in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A.

T ypes Ib and Ic supernovae appear to explode only in the spiral arms of spiral galaxies. Both show evidence of o xygen, magnesium and calcium in their spectra after peak brightness. In addition, Type Ib supernovae show evidence of helium at times near maximum light. The light-curves of both Ib and Ic are similar to Type Ia but dimmer at maximum light. They are often strong radio sources, whereas no radio emissions have yet been detect- ed from Type Ia. Types Ib and Ic supernovae are thought to be produced by explosions of the cores of massive stars that have been stripped of their hydrogen, and, in the case of Type Ic, of their helium as well. Supernovae produce NEUTRON STARS , and many have been observed at the centre of the remains of the disinte- gr a ted stellar envelope. The nebula created by the superno- va is termed a SUPERNOVA REMNANT . Supernova remnants with PULSARS at their centres are termed PLERIONS . Supernovae are relatively rare, discovered at the rate of about one every century in an average galaxy. They are discovered relatively infrequently in edge-on spiral galax- ies because their light is dimmed by dust. Only five have been discovered in the Milky Way in the last millennium, with SUPERNOVA SN 1987 A occurring in the close compan- ion galaxy, the LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD , in 1987. Recent technological advances, especially the CCD , becoming available to amateur astronomers have meant a dramatic increase in the number of supernovae discover- ies in other galaxies in recent years. Computer-controlled telescopes equipped with CCDs scan a large number of remote galaxies each clear night, and comparisons made with previous images reveal any supernovae explosions. The supernova of 1054 was identified by Edwin HUB - BLE as the progenitor of the Crab Nebula. Like the super- novae of 1006 and 1181, it was recorded by oriental astronomers as they scanned the sky for celestial portents. Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Arabic and European astronomers contributed to records of these supernovae: the 1054 supernova was probably depicted in Native American art. The supernova of 1572 was carefully observed by T ycho BRAHE . He recorded data on its unchanging posi- tion and its stellar magnitude as it faded day by day. Brahe demonstrated that the supernova, which was circumpolar from Denmark, had no P ARALLAX as the Earth rotated. This placed the star well beyond the Moon. Its lack of motion over the 18 months that it was visible meant that it w as beyond Saturn, the most distant planet then known. This discovery placed the supernovae among the ‘fixed stars’ and proved that they were subject to the same laws of change as terrestrial phenomena. The supernova of 1604 is known as Kepler’s star, although Johannes Kepler was not the first to see it. Both Kepler’s and Tycho’s supernovae inspired a wealth of comment by many writers of the 16th and 17th centuries, including Richard Corbet, Henry More, John Donne, Edmund Spenser and John Dryden. There is evidence that a supernova exploded in Cas- siopeia in around 1680. An expanding gaseous remnant of an exploded star is observed as a powerful emitter of radio radiation; it is known as CASSIOPEIA A . No optical outburst was recorded, but the star may have ejected a g reat deal of its outer layers before exploding, or been rel- a tivity small and compact. supernova remnant (SNR) What is left after a SUPERNOVA explosion has occurred. For some supernovae, there are two components to the supernova remnant – the central NEUTRON STAR , PULSAR or BLACK HOLE and the expanding cloud of gas. Only the last of these, however, is included in the usual meaning of the term SNR. In appearance SNRs may resemble some HII REGIONS , b ut they often have more of a filamentary, shell-like mor- phology than the latter. The radio emissions from the two types of object allow them to be differentiated unequivo- cally, since recombination lines appear in the radio spectra of HII regions but not in those from SNRs. Furthermore, SYNCHROTRON RADIATION produces much of the emission from SNRs and this is strongly polarized, whereas the emission from HII regions is unpolarized. Given that they are created by an explosion, it is clear that SNRs must be expanding. The initial expansion v elocities can be 10,000 to 20,000 km/s (6000–12,000 mi/s), though this reduces to a few hun- dred km/s with time. Nonetheless after a century or two, the nebula’s physical size is measured in light-years. The CRAB NEBULA for example is about 13 l.y. across, the Cygnus Loop about 100 l.y. and the LOCAL BUBBLE , which may have resulted from a much older supernova explosion, is some 300 l.y. in diameter. The kinetic tem- perature of the material initially exceeds 10 6 K, but this is reduced as energy is radiated away. The particle densi- ties range from 10 6 m \u0001 3 to 10 12 m \u0001 3 , with 10 9 m \u0001 3 being fairly typical for the visible portions of an SNR. The masses of the nebulae range from a fraction to a few times the solar mass. The development of an SNR occurs in several stages. At first the hot gases exploding outwards at around 10,000 km/s (6000 mi/s) have densities so much higher than that of the surrounding interstellar medium that the expansion is essentially into a vacuum. After about a century, when the SNR is around 1 l.y. or so in size, the interstellar material swept up by the expanding remnant reaches densities at which it starts to impede the expan- sion. This creates a turbulent shock region, with syn- chrotron emission coming from the relativistic electrons. The expansion velocity will then slowly decrease until at about 100 km/s (60 mi/s) optical line emission from the heavier elements becomes significant. The last identifi- able stage may be as a hot low-density cavity blown into the interstellar medium. Finally, after some few hundred thousand years, the remnant will merge with the inter- stellar medium. Most SNRs have the appearance of a thin spherical shell, with much fine structure. Type Ia supernovae, such as that seen by Tycho BRAHE in 1572, lead to shells that are brighter towards their outer edges at radio and X-ray wavelengths, with only Balmer emission lines detected in the visible. Type II supernovae, such as the one that produced Cassiopeia A, result in shells contain- ing numerous rapidly moving knots of material that are ve ry bright at both radio and X-ray wavelengths, with thermal emission dominating the X-rays. A few SNRs, however, like the Crab Nebula, are filled-in to their cen- tres. These are given the name PLERIONS , and their dif- ference probably arises from the presence of a central supernova remnant 396 S \u0001 supernova The light-curve of a supernova shows a sudden brightening as the outer atmosphere is thrown off after the stellar core has collapsed. This peak is followed by a steady decline for about two months, after which this fading slows further.

An SNR should be detectable for a period of a few hundred thousand years after the explosion. Since the estimated rate of supernovae in our GALAXY is around ten per century, there should be sever- al thousand SNRs in our Galaxy. Only about a hundred are actually known, however, and most of these are detected by their radio emissions. The disparity is proba- bly a result of SNRs’ low surface brightnesses and the obscuration of the more distant examples. The radio emission from SNRs is mostly produced by synchrotron radiation. Initially, the electrons producing this radiation result from the supernova explosion. Later, except in plerions, the electrons probably gain their ener- gies whilst passing through the shock fronts where the expanding SNR meets the interstellar medium. A few SNRs are observable outside the radio and X-ray regions. In particular, the Crab Nebula emits detectable radiation from the infrared to the gamma-ray region. Most of this again appears to be due to synchrotron radiation, as shown by the high degree of optical polarization of the nebula. Some of the visible light, however, results from RECOMBINATION after the gas has been ionized by the ultraviolet synchrotron emission. The X-ray emission from SNRs results from synchrotron radiation and from electron–ion collisions in the hot gas. SNRs affect their locality in several ways. Since Type II supernovae originate from short-lived massive stars, they will often occur whilst the star is still inside a dense gas cloud. The pressure of the expanding SNR may then ini- tiate further star formation. The energy of the SNR adds to the energy and turbulence of the interstellar medium. It also enriches it in elements heavier than helium, which were synthesized in the supernova and its preceding star. Finally, as particles are accelerated during interactions between the turbulent high-velocity gases and the magnet- ic fields of an SNR, COSMIC RAYS may be produced. Supernova SN 1987A Bright SUPERNOVA that flared up in the Large Magellanic Cloud in 1987 February, reaching naked-eye visibility. It was the first supernova to do so since Kepler’s star of 1604. Supernova SN 1987 A was a Type II supernova, and a flood of neutrinos was detected from its eruption, suggesting that a NEUTRON STAR was formed. No subsequent evidence of a neutron star has been found, but it may be obscured in some way. The precursor star (Sanduleak \u0001 69º202) of the super- nova explosion was a compact blue SUPERGIANT , rather than the red giant or supergiant that current theories pre- dict should give rise to a Type II supernova. It has been suggested that the star may have had a binary companion that was consumed as the progenitor became a red giant, increasing both its size and temperature. The set of three nested rings that have subsequently been observed may be related to the fact that the system was a binary system, but this remains unclear. superstring theory Theory of ELEMENTARY PARTICLES that asserts that the most fundamental forms of matter and energy are not particles but minute vibrating strings. The shape, topology and frequency of vibrations of these strings determine the physical properties of the particles. The scale of these strings is very small, of the order of 10 \u0001 33 cm. This in itself is a problem since they are the smallest possible quanta and thus can never be observed. However, if one assumes these strings do exist, and they do make up elementary particles and fields, then one can construct a model that could possibly describe everything in the universe – a THEORY OF EVERYTHING (TOE). supersymmetry Principle that attempts to explain the different strengths of the FUNDAMENTAL FORCES in the STANDARD MODEL . This model accurately describes the three fundamental forces and provides a grand unification. If the interaction strengths of the three GUT forces ( see GRAND UNIFIED THEORY ) are extrapolated to high energies, they all come together around 10 16 GeV. The interaction strength of each force needs to be specified independently in the standard model; this problem is called the hierarchy problem. Supersymmetry attempts to explain the hierarchy problem in terms of a symmetric principle that assigns a symmetric partner to every known elementary particle and also relates fermions to bosons. surface gravity Acceleration, g , due to the GRAVITATIONAL FORCE experienced by a freely falling object close to the surface of a massive body. It is given by: where G is the gravitational constant and M and R are the mass and radius respectively of the massive body.

Surveyor Series of seven soft-landing lunar spacecraft launched by NASA between 1966 May and 1968 January in preparation for the Apollo landings.

Other payloads included a combined surface-sampler/trench- digger and a simple soil composition analyser. Among the wealth of data returned were panoramic and close-up images, data on the bearing strength, optical and thermal properties of the surface, the content of magnetic material and its major-element chemistry. Su Song (or Su Sung) (1020–1101) Chinese astronomer, noted for his clock-driven astronomical instruments. In 1090 Su Song finished his two-storey clock tower at Kaifeng. Inside was a clock-driven celes- tial globe, while moving figures indicating the time were visible from the outside. Surmounting the tower was an armillary sphere fitted with a sighting tube. Globe and sphere automatically followed the rotation of the skies, and were the first astronomical instruments to do so, anticipating Western automatic clock-driven instruments by six centuries. SU Ursae Majoris star (UGSU) Subtype of CATACLYSMIC VARIABLE known generically as a DW ARF NOVA (commonly called U GEMINORUM STAR ). Their behaviour resembles that of the classical U Geminorum/SS Cygni subtype (UGSS) in that there are short and long maxima. In the SU Ursae Majoris stars, however, the latter are known as supermaxima, because they are half to one magnitude brighter than normal outbursts, and remain at maximum for 10 to 20 days (as against 4 days for a normal outburst). For almost all maxima, stars of this type rise to near maximum brightness in 24 hours or less. Some have a short pause at an intermediate magnitude on the rise for an hour or two. They also have periodic oscillations, termed superhumps, superimposed on the light-curve with amplitudes of 0.2 to 0.5 mag. Their period is about 3% longer than the orbital period.

Swift also found 13 comets, including 109P/ SWIFT – TUTTLE , which produces the annual PER - SEID meteor shower. He served as director of the H.H. Wa r ner Observatory in Rochester, New York and the T.S. Lowe Observatory on Echo Mountain, near Pasadena, California. Swift–Tuttle, Comet 109P/ Short-period comet discovered by Lewis Swift on 1862 July 16, and independently three days later by Horace Tuttle (1837–1923). The comet became a naked-eye object, at mag. \u0001 2.0 in early September, when the tail reached a length of 25–30º. The last observations in the discovery apparition were made at the end of October. Uncertainties over the orbital period remained until the next return – ten years later than some predictions – in 1992. Comet 109P/Swift–Tuttle returned to perihelion on 1992 December 12, reaching mag. \u0001 5.0. As at the previ- ous return, the comet’s NUCLEUS showed considerable jet activity, a source of NON - GRAVITATIONAL FORCE , which partly explains the earlier difficulty in deriving an orbit. The period is now taken to be close to 135 years, and the comet is, as originally proposed by Brian Marsden (1937– ) of the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astro- physics, identical with Comet Kegler of 1737.

See also CALIBAN symbiotic star (variable) BINARY STAR that exhibits the spectral characteristics of two grossly different temperature regimes. Typically there are absorption bands such as those found in giants and supergiants of late spectral classes around 3000 K, together with emission from a hot star of about 20,000 K. In addition, emission from hot, surrounding nebulosity is often detectable. Symbiotic stars exhibit a wide range of characteristics. They may all be classed as CATACLYSMIC V ARIABLES , in which gas from the cool star is accreted by the smaller companion, giving rise to outbursts. Z ANDROMEDAE STARS resemble DW ARF NOVAE , but with a g iant (rather than main-sequence) secondary. In certain systems, such as RR Telescopii, there is a high rate of MASS TRANSFER , producing systems with extremely extended outbursts. Such systems were formerly known as ‘very slow novae’ but are now more commonly called ‘symbiotic novae’. Some systems – most notably R Aquarii – appear to consist of a pulsating MIRA STAR transferring mass to an A CCRETION DISK and thence to a condensed object that is ejecting material in a pair of luminous jets. This is very similar to the configuration found in the strange object SS 433, where the condensed component appears to be a neutron star, with an accretion disk and exceptionally strong polar jets. synchronous orbit Orbit in which a satellite’s period of REVOLUTION is the same as the planet’s period of axial RO TA TION . For Earth, the radius of the orbit is 42,164 km (26,200 mi). The satellite appears to hover over one point on the equator, neither rising nor setting. The main significance for natural satellites is that the direction of TIDAL EVOLUTION is inwards or outwards according to whether the satellite is below or above the synchronous orbit. Many artificial satellites of the Earth have been placed in such orbits, but the only natural example among the planets is Pluto’s satellite, CHARON . It is an ultimate state resulting from tidal evolution; it requires that the secondary is a substantial fraction of the mass of the primary, in order that it can absorb the spin angular momentum of the primary. Eventually the Moon will reach this state. The Earth’s rotation is slowing as the Moon recedes from the Earth ( see also SECULAR A CCELERATION ), and this will continue until the day has lengthened to be the same as the month (but this will take about 10 billion years). synchronous rotation Coincidence of the rotational period of a celestial body with its orbital period. This has the effect of causing a planetary moon, for example, always to present the same face towards the planet it orbits, as is the case with the Earth and the Moon. The phenomenon, also known as captured rotation, is caused by tidal friction. See also TIDE synchrotron radiation ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION emitted by charged particles (usually electrons) moving in magnetic fields at large fractions of the speed of light. The charged particles follow helical paths along magnetic lines of force and emit radiation because of the accelerations to which they are subjected. The process is closely related to FREE – FREE RADIATION . The wavelength of the emitted radiation decreases as the energy of the electrons increases, and is strongly polarized. Synchrotron radiation produces much of the emission from the CRAB NEBULA , PULSARS and RADIO GALAXIES . synodic Strictly, a term that means ‘pertaining to two successive conjunctions of celestial bodies’; it is more commonly used to describe a single cycle of any phase of a celestial body viewed from a given point.

With Alshain ( \u0004 Aquilae), mag. 3.71, it forms the ‘wings’ either side of the ‘eagle star’, Altair. The names Alshain and Tarazed come from a Persian expression referring to a beam or balance. T association Region of recent and active star formation in which the dominant visible population comprises low-mass, roughly solar, stars. These stars, in their pre- MAIN - SEQUENCE phase of life, are styled T TA URI STARS . They are named after the prototype in the TA URUS DARK CLOUDS complex, which, at a distance of 500 light-years, is one of the nearest stellar nurseries to the Sun. Low-mass stars form throughout the dark clouds of T associations, and EMBEDDED CLUSTERS can be observed at infrared wavelengths. Occasionally, high-mass young stars are also found in T associations, but only within the dark- est, densest cores of clouds. The importance of T associations is that their mem- bers afford a series of snapshots of our young Sun through its infancy. If we could order these different stars correctly, we would have constructed an evolutionary sequence for our Sun. It might also be clear how and when the planets formed, and over what period. The T Tauri stars themselves are irregular optical vari- ables. In the nearby Taurus–Auriga T association the stars are of the 11th to 19th visual magnitude. Infrared bright- ness characterizes T association stars, because they are still surrounded by dusty obscuring circumstellar material, which will eventually be accreted by the central star. Of topical interest is the manner in which the already formed stars of a T association interact with their parent gas clouds. Vigorous winds terminate the protostellar ACCRE - TION phase of T Tauri stars (perhaps after only a million years) and stir up the ambient medium of the T associa- tion through BIPOLAR FLOWS . Such flows are likely to act against the ready formation of new low-mass stars in their immediate vicinities. Taurids METEOR SHOWER active between October 15 and November 25, producing low rates even during its broad peak in the opening week of November. At best, observed rates may reach 5 meteors/hr, from radiants near the Hyades and Pleiades. The shower is produced by debris from Comet 2P/ ENCKE . Material in the Taurid meteor stream has become very spread out. Taurids are slow (30 km/s or 19 mi/s) and a reasonable proportion are bright. The stream is encountered again during June, when it produces the daytime BETA TAURIDS . Taurus dark clouds Large complex of gas and dust clouds in Taurus forming a GIANT MOLECULAR CLOUD . They are about 500 l.y. away. The clouds are the site of continuing star formation and of many TTA URI STARS .

The comet reached perihelion 0.82 AU from the Sun on June 12, and became a bright, magnitude 0 object as it moved into northern hemisphere skies. Earth passed through the comet’s tail on June 30 at the time of closest approach (0.13 AU), the first recorded instance of such an encounter. The tail reached a maximum extent of about 100º. Comet Tebbutt has an orbital period of 409 years. technetium star Star, generally a GIANT STAR on the asymptotic giant branch of the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM , that shows technetium in its spectra. T echnetium is an unstable radioactive element. It does not occur naturally on Earth but was the first element to be created artificially. As it has a HALF - LIFE of 2.1 \t 10 5 y ears, shorter than the life of the stars in which it is observed, it must be created in the star. It is believed to be created during SHELL BURNING . tectonics Deformation of the LITHOSPHERE of a planetary body. On Earth, the dominant mechanism for producing large-scale topographic features is ‘plate tectonics’. Large sections of the lithosphere, thousands of kilometres in extent, are shifted by convective motions in the underlying MANTLE . Differential motions of these ‘plates’, moving at a few centimetres per year, result in distortions. Plates sliding past each other are bounded by strike-slip faults; these faults are sources of earthquakes, when accumulated stress causes rupture of the lithosphere. Head-on collisions at thrust faults cause compression and uplift, producing mountain ranges, such as the Himalayas at the conjunction of the Indian and Asiatic plates. Stretching of continental plates produces normal faults and linear depressed features ( GRABENS ). Oceanic crust is subducted into the MANTLE at trenches; it is renewed by lava rising at mid-ocean ri dges where plates are pulling apart. Plate tectonics is responsible for continental drift; over Earth’s history the continents have been rearranged like pieces of a gigantic puzzle. Other planets have different styles of tectonics. Mercury’s numerous scarps or ridges appear to be the result of compression; they apparently w ere produced by global shrinkage of the planet as its core cooled and solidified. Venus’ large circular features (coro- nae) may have been produced by upward or downward motions of magma below the lithosphere. Mars has numerous grabens associated with its large volcanoes; the huge canyon V ALLES MARINERIS may be a rift valley, although there is little evidence for plate tectonics. Jupiter’s satellites Europa and Ganymede show evidence of motions of sections of their icy crusts. tektite Object of natural glass found scattered across four main areas, known as STREWNFIELDS , of the Earth’s T tektite 401 T AURUS ( GEN .

The Australasian strewnfield stretches from T asmania, across Australia to Sumatra and the Philippines and to the Southeast Asian mainland. Australian tektites, known as australites, are 830,000 years old, compared with 690,000 years old for the remainder of the strewnfield, thus two groups may be represented. The parent crater for this strewnfield is unknown. The Ivory Coast tektites are 1.3 million years old. They are related to the impact crater of similar age at Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. Moldavites are tektites found in the Czech Republic. Their age, of 14.7 million years, links them with the Ries impact structure in south Germany. The North American tektites, found in Texas and Georgia (and one only from Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts), are 34 million years old. They are now linked to the Chesapeake Bay impact structure. Micrometeorites related to the Australasian, Ivory Coast and North American tektites occur in marine sediments. T ektites are unrelated to volcanism. Their usual shapes, such as teardrop, disc or dumbbell, suggest that they were once fluid, but they may be corroded. The Southeast Asian tektites are the largest, with masses of up to 15 kg; the Muong-Nong type have laminar flow struc- tures. Many of the south-east Australian tektites have fea- tures indicative of high-velocity atmospheric flight, such as a ‘button’ shape, atmospheric ablation having melted the front part of an original sphere, causing melt to flow backwards to form a flange. Ivory Coast and Australasian tektites are opaque, unless very thin. Moldavites are green and North Amer- ican tektites brown. All are silica-rich, containing inclu- sions of lechatelierite (pure silica glass) and other residual minerals. A lunar origin was suggested for tek- tites, but the return of lunar samples reinforced the ter- restrial chemical and isotopic signatures. Tektites are terrestrial material that has been subjected to extraterres- trial impact. Following the impact, molten or vaporized ejected material coagulated and re-entered the atmos- phere to land as tektites. tele-compressor Converging lens inserted into the light path of a telescope to reduce the focal length; it produces a wider field of view and a faster focal ratio for photograph- ic purposes. tele-extender Extension tube containing an optical device and used in conjunction with an EYEPIECE to increase the effective focal length of a telescope. telescope Device that augments the ability of the eye to observe distant or faint objects, particularly celestial objects. The Egyptians were making glass around 3000 BC , and the Greeks had a good understanding of the refraction and reflection of light by glass lenses in 300 BC , b ut it was nearly two thousand years before the telescope made its appearance. In 1608 the Dutch spectacle-maker Hans LIPPERSHEY applied for a patent for his ‘instrument for seeing at a distance’, the first REFRACTING TELESCOPE . While Lippershey is generally acknowledged to be the inventor of the telescope, there were enough competing claims that his patent application was denied. There is also some evidence that devices resembling the telescope were around in the previous century ( see DIGGES ). It was in May 1609 that Galileo first heard about the telescope while travelling in Venice. He proceeded to build one within 24 hours of returning home. His design, the GALILEAN TELESCOPE , enabled him to observe four moons of Jupiter, mountains and valleys on the Moon, sunspots and the phases of Venus. However, it suffered from severe CHROMATIC ABERRATION and SPHERICAL ABERRATION . Around 1616, Niccolò Zucchi (1586–1670), a profes- sor of mathematics from Rome, proposed a solution to these problems by replacing the objective lens with a mir- ror, creating the first REFLECTING TELESCOPE , but got poor results from the example he constructed and aban- doned the effort. Johannes KEPLER , René Descartes (1596–1650), Marin Mersenne (1588–1648), James GRE - GORY and Robert HOOKE all developed alternative designs, b ut the technologies of the day were unable to produce w orkable instruments from their specifications. By the late 1650s, the only solution to the aberrations that plagued the refractors of the day was to increase the FOCAL LENGTH . Chromatic and spherical aberration are both reduced when the focal length is increased, and so the telescopes grew. By 1670 almost unusable f /300 mon- sters stretching 67 m (220 ft) from objective to eyepiece w ere being built. In 1671 Isaac Newton began to experiment with the possibility of an achromatic refractor. Due to a flaw in his experimental procedure, Newton concluded that an achromatic refractor was not possible, and began to research Zucchi’s reflecting designs. The result was the NEWTONIAN TELESCOPE , although it would be almost 300 y ears before the design gained the popularity it enjoys today. Appearing at about the same time was the CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE , which would eventually become the most popular design for large professional instru- ments, despite Newton’s intense criticism of the design.

T empel, (Ernst) Wilhelm (Leberecht) (1821–89) Ger- man observational astronomer, a prolific discoverer of comets. He found his first comet (C/1859 G1) from Italy, using a 4-inch (100-mm) Steinheil refractor. Over the next 18 years he discovered twelve more of these objects, five asteroids and several nebulae, including the reflection nebula around Merope in the PLEIADES . Most of Tempel’s comet discoveries were made from Marseilles Observato- ry ; he also worked as Giovanni SCHIAPARELLI ’s assistant at Brera Observatory (Milan) and directed ARCETRI OBSER - VAT O RY (Florence). T empel-1, Comet 9P/ Short-period comet discovered on 1867 April 3 by Wilhelm Tempel. It is always faint and was lost from 1879 until 1967. The orbit was modified by passages close to Jupiter in 1881, 1941 and 1953. Currently, the perihelion distance is 1.49 AU, and the period is 5.51 years. T empel–Tuttle, Comet 55P/ Short-period comet discovered on 1865 December 19 by Wilhelm Tempel, Marseilles, France, and independently on 1866 January 5 by Horace Tuttle (1837–1923), Harvard, USA. The comet currently has a period of 33.22 years, and the orbit is retrograde, being inclined to the ecliptic by 162º.5. During its discovery apparition, the comet reached peak magnitude \u0001 3, and showed a short tail. Although the orbit was established at this return, Comet 55P/Tempel–Tuttle was not observed again until 1965. At one of its past returns, in 1366, it made the third- closest approach (0.0229 AU) of a comet to Earth in historical times. The most recent return, with perihelion on 1998 February 28, was quite favourable, with the comet reaching peak magnitude \u0001 6.5. Comet 55P/Tempel–Tuttle is the parent of the LEONIDS , which have produced meteor storms close to several of the comet’s past returns (most recently in 1966, 1999 and 2001); they show substantially enhanced activity for about five years to either side of perihelion. T empel-2, Comet 10P/ Short-period comet discovered on 1873 July 3 by Wilhelm Tempel. Its current period is 5.47 years. IRAS observations in 1983 showed 10P/Tempel-2 to have an associated dust trail more than 0.67 AU (100,000,000 km or 62,000,000 mi) long. temperature Property of an object that determines whether heat energy will flow into it or out of it when it is in contact with another object. The direction of flow of heat energy is from the object at the higher temperature to that at the lower. If there is no energy flow then the two objects are in THERMAL EQUILIBRIUM . T emperature is quantified through various physical phenomena. The most generally applicable measure is the EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE , which is based on the tempera- ture of an equivalent BLACK BODY . Other temperatures include: the RADIATION TEMPERATURE , which is based on the black body emission at a single wavelength; the colour temperature, based upon the COLOUR INDEX ; the thermal or kinetic temperature, based upon the thermal motions of the atoms, ions, electrons and so on; the excitation tem- perature, based upon the levels of EXCITATION of the elec- trons within an atom or ion; and the ionization temperature, based upon the levels of IONIZATION of an element. The value obtained for the temperature may vary depending on the property upon which it is based. Thus the effective temperature of the solar CORONA is about 100 K, while the kinetic temperature of the electrons with- in it is about 1,000,000 K. temperature scale Graduated scale of degrees for measuring TEMPERATURE . The principal temperature scales are the ABSOLUTE (or Kelvin) scale and the CELSIUS (or Centigrade) scale. The unit of temperature on the absolute scale, the kelvin (K), is equal in magnitude to one degree on the Celsius scale (ºC). The zero points of the two scales differ however, with 0ºC equal to 273.15 K. To convert from one scale to the other, 273.15 has to be added to the temperature on the Celsius scale or subtracted from the temperature on the absolute scale. All physical formulae require the temperature to be expressed on the absolute scale. T empe Terra Region of MARS east of AC IDALIA PLANITIA (40º.0N 71º.0W).

From the Earth, the terminator is only visible on those bodies that exhibit PHASES , that is Mercury, Venus, Mars and the Moon. Because of its relative proximity, it is possible to see that the mountainous surface of the Moon causes its terminator to appear jagged and irregular, rather than as a smooth line. terracing Fo rm a tion of terraces – relatively flat, horizontal or gently inclined surfaces, bounded by a steeper ascending slope on one side and by a steeper descending slope on the opposite side.

These contrast with the largely gaseous giant or JOVIAN planets. (Pluto, having more in common with cometary planetesimals, is not generally included in this group.) The differences between the terrestrial and Jovian planets are thought to have been caused by their respective distances from the Sun during the early formation of the Solar System.

In one region the plains between large ancient craters have been flooded by CRYOVOLCANISM up to the crater rims. This happened a long time ago, because there has been time for many younger (and smaller) craters to have formed on the plains. Tethys is remarkable in having one enormous crater, named ODYSSEUS , the diameter (440 km/270 mi) of which is 40% of the diameter of the satellite itself. The impact that created this crater was almost violent enough to break Tethys into fragments. A giant trough up to 100 km (60 mi) wide and 3 km (2 mi) deep, named Ithaca Chasma, encircles the globe 90º away from Odysseus. The trough may be a fracture formed in response to the impact that created the crater. The only other substantial satellite to have a crater of this magnitude with respect to the size of the whole body is MIMAS . However, whereas the giant crater on Mimas has retained its pristine shape, the topography of Odysseus has become subdued, probably because the LITHOSPHERE of Tethys was too weak to support it.

Thales of Miletus ( c .625– c .547 BC ) Greek polymath, born in what is now modern Turkey, famous for his teach- ing that everything in the Universe sprang from a primor- dial mass of water. According to Herodotus ( c .484–425 BC ), Thales predicted the total eclipse of the Sun that occurred in 585 BC , though this may be apoc- r yphal. Thales travelled to Egypt and Babylon, bringing back to Greece the astronomical knowledge of those civi- lizations. He defined the constellation Ursa Minor, which, because of its inclusion of the North Pole Star, he used for navigational purposes. Tharsis Montes (Tharsis Ridge) Main volcanic region of MARS .

For astronomical sources it is usually either BLACK BODY RADIATION or FREE – FREE RADIATION . Non-thermal radiation sources include SYNCHROTRON RADIATION and MASER emission. If these latter sources are mistakenly interpreted as thermal radiation, then the inferred temperature may be many orders of magnitude too high. thermosphere Outermost layer of the Earth’s A TMOSPHERE . It lies above the mesopause, at a height of 86–100 km (53–62 mi), which is the upper boundary of the MESOSPHERE . Within the thermosphere, the temperature rises with height as the Sun’s far-ultraviolet and X-ray radiation is absorbed by the oxygen and nitrogen of the thin air. This process produces ionized a toms and molecules and is responsible for the formation of the layers in the IONOSPHERE , at altitudes of between 60 and 500 km (40 and 310 mi). AU R ORAE and METEORS also occur in the thermosphere. The temperature climbs to about 780 K at 150 km (90 mi) and 1600 K at 500 km (310 mi). However, the atmospheric density is extremely low, decreasing from seven-millionths of its sea-level v alue at the mesopause to only about one-million- millionth (10 \u0002 12 ) at 500 km (310 mi) altitude. This density varies with solar activity, increasing when the Sun is active, when the additional heating of the uppermost layers causes the atmosphere to expand. The region above 500 km (310 mi) is often known as the EXOSPHERE . Third Cambridge Catalogue (3C) Third in a series of four catalogues of radio sources compiled from surveys carried out from the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge, during the 1950s and 1960s by a team that included Antony HEWISH , Martin R YLE and Francis GRAHAM - SMITH . The Third Cambridge Catalogue Survey was completed in 1959, using collectors of greater area and higher sensitivity than its two predecessors; it became the definitive listing of radio sources. Sources in this catalogue are still known by their ‘3C’ designations, for example 3C 273, the first object to be identified as a quasar. third contact During a SOLAR ECLIPSE , the moment when the Moon’s trailing (westerly) limb appears to touch the Sun’s more westerly limb.

For example, when analysing the motion of an asteroid close to a commensurability with Jupiter, one might use the plane circular restricted three-body problem. This considers Jupiter to be in a circular orbit, unperturbed by other planets, and the asteroid to be of zero mass and to move in the plane of Jupiter’s orbit. The task of determining analytically the PERTURBA - TIONS of the orbit of a planet or satellite caused by other bodies is invariably reduced to a series of three-body problems. For example, what is referred to as ‘the main problem’ of lunar theory is to determine the orbit of the Moon around the Earth perturbed by the Sun, with all three bodies regarded as point masses. Perturbations by other planets, and effects of the oblateness of the Earth and the Moon are added later. Even so, it is a substantial problem.

This object has by far the brightest optical and X-ray jet among quasars. 3 kiloparsec arm Spiral arm lying about 3.5 kpc from the centre of our GALAXY ; it is visible as 21 cm neutral h ydrogen radio emission ( see TWENTY - ONE CENTIMETRE LINE ).

The name is from the Arabic thu’ba ̄n , meaning ‘serpent’. tidal bulge Deformation of a celestial body in orbit around another as a result of the higher gravitational a ttraction on the nearside and lower attraction on the farside of the body, compared with the attraction at the centre of the body. The resulting distortion lies along the line joining the two bodies, with bulges both towards and aw ay from the attracting body ( see diagram at TIDES ). The effect on a fluid ocean is easily understood, but even solid bodies are not completely rigid and will deform because of tidal forces. The Sun raises tidal bulges on the planets, and planets raise tidal bulges on the satellites orbiting them. Satellites also raise tidal bulges on their planets. In the case of the Earth and Moon, the tides raised on the Earth are large, because the Moon is a fairly large fraction (1/81) of the mass of the Earth. However even a tiny satellite such as Phobos raises tides on its planet, Mars. These tides are small, and have no significant effect on Mars, but the attraction of this bulge acting back on Phobos causes very significant TIDAL EVOLUTION of the orbit of Phobos. tidal evolution Mechanism that can cause changes to the spin rates of planets and satellites, and to the orbital radii of satellites. The rates of change are very slow, but the accumulated effect can be very significant over the age of the Solar System. The attraction of one body on another raises a TIDAL BULGE on that body. TIDAL FRICTION causes a slight delay in the rise and fall of the bulge, with the result that it does not quite lie along the line between the two bodies: it will either lead or lag, depending on whether the attracting body is orbiting faster or slower than the body is rotating. Thus the gravitational attraction between a satellite and its planet is asymmetrical, with the force having a component at right angles to the line between the bodies; this force exerts a torque. In the case of a satellite orbiting slower than the planet is rotating (that is, it is above the SYNCHRONOUS ORBIT ), the nearer bulge exerts a larger torque than the farther bulge, and so there is a net torque acting in the direction of motion of the satellite, and an equal and opposite torque acting on the rotation of the planet. This causes the satellite to spiral outwards, and slows the rotation of the planet. A satellite below the synchronous orbit would spiral inwards, and the planet w ould rotate faster. Tidal evolution has had many effects on the Solar Sys- tem. Tides raised by the Sun on planets can despin the planets; this is a probable explanation for the present slow rotation rates of Mercury and Venus. Tides raised by satellites on planets have had numerous effects: causing the Moon to recede and the Earth’s rotation to slow down; causing Phobos to spiral into Mars; and causing satellites of Jupiter and Saturn to spiral outwards and become trapped in COMMENSURABILITIES . Tides raised by planets on satellites have resulted in most satellites being in SYN - CHRONOUS ROTATION with their planet; they have caused intense heating within some satellites, notably IO . tidal friction Dissipation of a small fraction of the energy contained in a TIDAL BULGE as it rises and falls. In the case of the Earth the main dissipation of tidal energy arises from friction at the bottom of shallow seas as the tides sweep through. In bodies without oceans the dissipation mechanisms are not so obvious, and estimates of the rate of dissipation are very uncertain. In a few cases the dissipation of tidal energy within a body can cause significant heating of the body, such as for Jupiter’s satellite IO . More often the most significant effect of the tidal friction is to cause a slight delay in the rise and fall of the tidal bulge, with the result that it does not quite lie along the line between the two bodies. This slight asymmetry causes a torque between the two bodies, which can cause TIDAL EVOLUTION . tidal heating Heat produced by the tidal force exerted on a satellite by its primary; this force can distort the satellite. The tidal force varies with distance, and if the satellite’s orbit is eccentric the satellite will change shape slightly during each revolution.

Without the effects of Jupiter’s gravity Io would be a dead world. Instead it is dotted with active volcanoes through which it rele ases energy.

Tidal heating drives V OLCANISM on Jupiter’s satellite IO . It probably maintains a liquid layer beneath the icy crust of EUROPA . Tidbinbilla Tracking Station See DEEP SPACE NETWORK tides Distortions induced in a celestial body by the gr a vitational attraction of one or more others. The force a body experiences is greatest on the side nearest the a ttracting body, and least on the side farthest away, causing it to elongate slightly towards and away from the a ttracting body, acquiring a TIDAL BULGE on each side. On the Earth tides are raised by the Moon and by the Sun, the effect of the Moon being about three times that of the Sun. As the Earth rotates, different parts of the surface move into the tidal bulge region, causing two high tides and two low tides in just over a day. The tides most obvi- ously affect the fluid ocean, but even the solid crust, which is supported by a fluid mantle, is able to flex, experiencing tides of up to 25-cm ( c .10-in.) amplitude. When the Sun and the Moon are exerting a pull in the same direction (as at new moon or full moon) their effects are additive and the high tides are higher (spring tides). When the pull of the Sun is at right angles to that of the Moon (as at first or last quarter) the high tides are lower (neap tides). TIDAL FRICTION caused by the tidal ebb and flow of wa ter over the ocean floor causes a slight delay in the response of the oceans to the tidal attracting forces, with the result that the tidal bulge does not lie precisely along the line to the attracting body. This asymmetry causes a torque between the Earth and the Moon ( see also TIDAL EVOLUTION ), which transfers angular momentum and energy from the Earth’s rotation to the orbit of the Moon. This results in a slowing of the Earth’s rotation and thus an increase in the length of the day ( see also LEAP SECOND ), and in the SECULAR ACCELERATION of the Moon, causing it to recede from the Earth at about 3.8 cm/yr (1.5 in./yr). A similar mechanism is probably responsible for evolution of the orbits of many of the nat- ural satellites of the Solar System. The tidal forces between the Earth and the Moon also cause a tidal bulge on the Moon. A similar effect of the transfer of angular momentum from the Moon’s rotation to its orbit has resulted in the present state of SYNCHRO - NOUS ROTATION , with the same face of the Moon always towards the Earth. Similarly most of the satellites of the major planets are in synchronous rotation with their pri- mary. For the Jovian satellite IO the tidal effect is very large, due to its relative closeness and the large mass of Jupiter. Also Io has a fairly large orbital eccentricity (0.0043), and this causes the tidal bulge on Io to rise and fall and oscillate around a mean position as the distance and direction of Jupiter vary in each orbital revolution. There is a dynamical process that would normally react on the orbit and reduce the eccentricity to eliminate this effect, but it cannot operate for Io, as its eccentricity is actually caused by its 2:1 COMMENSURABILITY with Europa. The result is that the continued dissipation of tidal energy has caused internal heating and is responsible for the violent volcanic activity on Io. tilted-component telescope (TCT) REFLECTING TELESCOPE that avoids obstructing the optical path by tilt- ing or warping some or all of the optical elements. The first attempt at a tilted-element telescope was the brachyt , developed around 1900. This was essentially a CASSEGRAIN TELESCOPE cut in half, and it had off-axis mirrors that were virtually impossible to grind. An improvement was the neo-brachyt in 1953; it had normal mirrors but required a warping harness to distort the sec- ondary into the proper curve. The schiefspiegler , invent- ed in 1940 by Anton Kutter (1903–85), was much easier to make, having a convex and concave mirror of the same curvature, so that the secondary could be made from the tool that ground the primary. The schiefspiegler was limit- ed to long focal ratios in the f /20 to f /30 range. Kutter later refined this design into the tri-shiefspielgler in 1965. In 1957 Arthur S. Leonard invented the Y olo , a re-interpre- tation of the neo-Brachyt design with better performance, b ut still requiring the warping harness. Leonard’s later design, the Solano in 1971, added a third mirror and eliminated the harness. (Both designs are named after Californian counties.) The culmination of TCT designs is the Stevick–Paul . Invented in 1993 by amateur David Stevick (1944– ) and based on the design for a corrector assembly by French optician Maurice Paul from 1935, the Stevick–Paul has a tilted focal plane but negligible other distortions and can be built to reasonably fast (low) focal ratios. time Property of the Universe determined by the observed order of events and in which effects follow causes. Newtonian or classical physics allowed the existence of an absolute time framework, whereby different observers could agree on the time of occurrence of an event by making an allowance for the travel times of light over different distances. Such an absolute time framework permitted the simultaneous occurrence of events taking place at different points in space. The concept of simultaneity breaks down under relativistic physics. With RELATIVITY , different observers measure time elapsing at different rates depending on their relative v elocities, accelerations and strengths of their local gr a vitational fields (or SPACETIME distortions). Nonetheless, even under relativity events always follow causes, and a sequence of events occurring at a single point in space is seen by all observers to occur in the same order. Only if information could be passed from observer to observer faster than the speed of light in a v acuum, could this causality basis of time be upset, thus allowing travel backwards in time. Time, along with the three dimensions of space, becomes spacetime as conceived by relativity. The separa- tion of events in spacetime is invariant for all observers and is given by: s 2 = x 2 \u0001 y 2 \u0001 z 2 \u0002 c 2 t 2 where x , y and z are the spatial coordinates, t is the time, and c the velocity of light in a vacuum.

When the Sun and Moon are lying in the same direction, high tides are at their highest and the difference between high and low tides is at its greatest magnitude.

The measurement of time is the subject of ordinary observation and experience and is based upon sequences of events occurring at regular intervals. Annual and diur- nal changes led in pre-history to the concept of the year and the day. Less clearly, lunar cycles may have led to the month. The development of clocks of increasing accuracy and reliability began with the sundial and nocturne, and proceeded through the development of the water clock, pendulum, balance wheel, quartz crystal to the atomic clock of today. The current unit of time is the second, which has been defined since 1967 as ‘the duration of 9,192,631,770 peri- ods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the fundamental state of the atom caesium 133’. Within the limits of measure- ment, this definition was identical to the one in use previ- ously, which was based upon the Earth’s orbital motion. This ‘ephemeris second’ was defined as 1/31,556,925.9747 of the TROPICAL YEAR for 1900 Janu- ary 0 d 12 h . INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC TIME (TAI) is now used as the starting point for all other types of time scale. The time scale used for civil purposes is UNIVERSAL TIME (UT), otherwise known as GREENWICH MEAN TIME (GMT). It is defined as the HOUR ANGLE of the MEAN SUN plus 12 hours (so that the start of the civil day is midnight, not midday). UT is based upon the Earth’s rotation, not its orbital motion, and it is therefore affected by changes in the rotation of the Earth. The UT corrected for the CHAN - DLER WOBBLE is called UT1, and is the basis of civil time- keeping. It is kept to within 0.9 seconds of TAI by the occasional insertion or removal of a LEAP SECOND . The difference between the time given by a sundial (solar time) and UT is called the EQUATION OF TIME . The SOLAR DAY is 86,400 atomic seconds long. The Earth’s actual rotation period is given by the SIDEREAL DAY , and this is 86,164.1 atomic seconds (23 h 56 m 4 s .1) long. See also CALENDAR ; JULIAN DATE ; TIME ZONES . time dilation effect Effect whereby a clock on a moving object runs slower than a similar clock stationary with respect to the observer ( see SPECIAL RELATIVITY ). The dilation is by a factor of: where v is the object’s velocity and c the velocity of light. Thus an astronaut visiting a planet 25 l.y. away at a constant speed of 0.999 c (ignoring acceleration and deceleration times) would age by one year, while 25 years w ould elapse on Earth. GENERAL RELATIVITY predicts gr a vitational time dilation, whereby clocks run slowly in strong gravitational fields. Both kinds of time dilation have been confirmed experimentally. timekeeping Our concept of the passage of TIME is based on the regular rising and setting of the Sun each day, in other words the rotation of the Earth, which provides a ready-made framework by which to regulate events in our lives. The Earth, however, is not a good timekeeper; its rotation rate is irregular and slowing because of the effects of tidal braking. This did not become apparent, however, until the early 20th century, when the free pendulum clock was developed, which w as accurate to within a second a year. Subsequent quartz crystal-controlled clocks and atomic clocks confirmed the small, but significant, variations in the Earth’s rate of rotation. The first crude methods of accounting for the passage of time involved measuring the length of the shadow cast by a stick placed upright in the ground. Early mechanical clocks appeared during the 15th and 16th centuries and it w as then that the system of splitting the day up into hours of equal length came into regular use. The invention of the pendulum clock in the 17th century provided a more accurate means of timekeeping. During the 18th century clocks were perfected that were accurate enough to be used at sea to help determine longitude and also for scien- tific purposes. But even with these man-made methods of accounting for time, the basic way of measuring its pass- ing was still the rotation of the Earth, and clocks were adjusted accordingly to keep in step with it. Until 1955 the scientific standard of time, the second, w as based on the Earth’s period of rotation and was defined as 1/86,400 of the mean solar day. The current standard, the SI second, was defined in 1967 as being the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom ( see AT OMIC TIME ). The internationally adopted timescale INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC TIME (TAI) is formed by inter- comparing the results from many different atomic clocks around the world. In the UK, atomic clocks at the National Physical Lab- oratory (NPL) at Teddington keep the country’s time accurate to within one second in three million years. These clocks are used to disseminate time in a variety of wa ys, including via the MSF time signal, which is broad- cast from the Rugby Radio Station, and the familiar ‘six pips’. For civil time-keeping purposes a uniform TIMESCALE is used; it is formed by atomic clocks, but kept in step with the rotation of the Earth through the periodic introduction of LEAP SECONDS . For convenience, we also advance our clocks in summer by one hour in order to make better use of the increased daylight hours. Our need for, and use of, accurate time is expanding. F or everyday life, today’s watches and clocks are suffi- cient, but for other applications, more accurate methods are needed. Telecommunications systems rely on being able to measure precisely small intervals of time in order to ensure that data transmitted down telephone lines is sent at the correct rate. This has become ever more imper- a tive with the all-pervasive Internet and the increasing use of electronic means of communication such as e-mails. Navigation systems, used aboard shipping and aircraft (and even becoming widely available for road vehicles), use the Global Positioning System (GPS) of satellites which have atomic clocks on board. These satellites broadcast timing signals that enable ground positions to be established to within a few tens of metres. The quest for ever-more accurate methods of time- keeping goes on. Research is currently underway into the development of clocks using ‘ion traps’, in which ions held in an electromagnetic field are cooled by laser beam almost to absolute zero, keeping them stationary. It is anticipated that clocks using this technology will be around 1000 times more accurate than the current gener- a tion of atomic clocks. That means that they would lose no more than a single second over the entire lifetime of the Universe. See also GREENWICH MEAN TIME (GMT) timescale Specified system of measuring the passage of TIME based on a given frame of reference. There are two kinds of timescale: those based on the rotational or orbital period of the Earth, and those that measure continuous units of time defined by atomic processes. The best-known timescale in the world is GREENWICH MEAN TIME (GMT), which is based on the MEAN SOLAR TIME at the Greenwich MERIDIAN ; it is officially now known as UNIVERSAL TIME (UT). UT is a non-uniform timescale, derived by accurately and continually measuring the rota- tion of the Earth. Raw data from these measurements are used to produce a timescale called UT0, which is then cor- rected for the shift in longitude caused by the slight wan- dering of the Earth’s geographical poles ( see POLAR MOTION ). This corrected timescale is designated UT1. Since the rotation of the Earth is non-uniform, being subjected to tidal braking, any timescale based on this rotation will also be non-uniform. For scientific purposes, therefore, a continuous, uniform timescale is required and this is provided by INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC TIME (TAI), which is based on the SI second ( see AT OMIC TIME ).

In 1984 this replaced EPHEMERIS TIME , which was previously used for such calculations and w as based on the Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun. F or practical, everyday use we require a civil timescale that is both accurate and uniform but that is also linked to the rotation of the Earth. COORDINATED UNIVERSAL TIME (UTC) fulfils this purpose, being derived from atomic clocks but kept in step with the rotation of the Earth through the periodic introduction of LEAP SECONDS . Because of this, TAI and UTC run at the same uniform rate but differ by an integral number of seconds. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) in Paris co-ordinates international timescales. In the United Kingdom, responsibility for providing a national time service lies with the National Physical Lab- oratory (NPL) at Teddington. time zone Geographical division of the Earth’s surface, 15º of longitude wide, where civil time is deemed to be the same throughout. The globe is divided into 24 such zones, each one an hour different from its neighbours. The zone centred on the local MERIDIAN at the GREENWICH OBSERVATORY , and where GREENWICH MEAN TIME or UNIVERSAL TIME is kept, was adopted in 1884 as the reference point from which all other zones should be measured. Those east of Greenwich are ahead by an integral number of hours whilst those to the west are behind. At the 180º longitude line, the transition between the two is marked by the INTERNATIONAL DATE LINE .

Her PhD thesis at the University of Texas incorporated models of star formation and evolution, nucleosynthesis of the heavier elements, and the interstel- lar medium, opening up a new field of astrophysical cos- mology. Tinsley showed that a galaxy’s star formation history determines its colour and other properties. At Yale University (1975–1981) she extended this research, com- paring UBV colours of ‘normal’ galaxies with those of ‘peculiar’ galaxies disturbed by collisions, concluding that ‘normal’ spirals have lower star-formation rates and older av erage stellar ages. Titan By far the largest SATELLITE of SATURN ; it was found in 1655 by Christiaan HUYGENS . Titan was the first planetary satellite to be discovered since Jupiter’s GALILEAN SATELLITES in 1610. It is also the only satellite to have a substantial atmosphere, which was discovered in 1944 by Gerard KUIPER . Titan is the first outer planet satellite to have been tar- geted by a landing probe: the HUYGENS lander is due to detach from the CASSINI Saturn orbiter for a parachute descent to Titan’s surface in 2004 November. Cassini will map Titan’s surface by imaging radar. Huygens carries optical imagers for use during descent as well as a variety of analytical experiments to examine the nature of the a tmosphere and surface. VOYA GER images of Titan obtained in 1980 and 1981 merely showed an opaque orange atmosphere overlain by a blue haze layer. The HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE , however, has been able to see through the atmosphere to reveal an apparently stable pattern of ALBEDO markings. Titan has a similar density to Jupiter’s largest satellite, GANYMEDE , and is almost as big. Indeed, some old tables add the 200 km (120 mi) thickness of the opaque part of Titan’s atmosphere to its radius, thereby counting Titan as the largest planetary satellite of all. Titan’s density of 1.88 g/cm 3 argues for it being largely an icy body, but it is not known to what extent it has become internally dif- ferentiated ( see DIFFERENTIATION ) to form a rocky or iron-rich core. Most of Titan’s nitrogen- and methane-rich atmos- phere is probably inherited from gases scavenged directly from the SOLAR NEBULA and the circum-Saturn gas and dust cloud within which Titan grew. However, it is likely to have been augmented by subsequent degassing from Titan’s interior. The reason why the young Titan was able to scavenge and retain an atmosphere, whereas Ganymede and CALLISTO could not, is that Titan grew in a colder environment, being farther from the Sun and T time zone 408 Frankfurt Copenhagen Seoul T aipei Manila Jakarta Kuala Lumpur Bangkok Colombo Mumbai (Bombay) Karachi Dubai Kuwait T el Aviv Damascus Jeddah Addis Ababa Mauritius Kinshasa Abidjan Dakar Lisbon Paris Santiago Lima Anchorage V ancouver Montreal Denver Dallas Atlanta San Juan Panama City Bogota T ahiti Madrid Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago New York Miami Mexico City Caracas Honolulu Rio de Janeiro Buenos Aires Auckland Johannesburg London Cape Town Nairobi Lagos Cairo Bahrain Delhi Kolkata (Calcutta) Rome Athens Moscow Beijing Hong Kong T okyo Singapore T ehran Perth Sydney Auckland W ellington Berlin 12 9 7 6 8 6 5 4 4 4 11 10 11 11 12 12:45 4 3 4 2 10 11 12 11 11:30 12 11 10 10 9 10 10 8 6:30 5:30 5:30 5:30 4 5 7 6:30 5 5 4 3 3 6 3 1 0 0 5 4 5 3:30 3 3:30 5 5 4 3 2 1 0 2 0 11 14 12 12 13 12 9:30 9 1 1 2 3 1 2 0 9 9 11 11 10 8 8 7 8 7 7 8 9:30 10 10:30 11:30 12 10 12:45 10 12 11 1 0 1 5 3 3 3 4 2 1 3 2 3:30 4:30 4 5 7 9 10 Prime Meridian International Date Line International Date Line Monday Sunday ALASKAN TIME P ACIFIC TIME MOUNTAIN TIME CENTRAL TIME EASTERN TIME A TLANTIC TIME 10 add one calendar day lose one calendar day Monday Sunday 0 3 5:45 CENTRAL EUROPEAN TIME 2 5 11 13 12 -5 -4 -11 -9 -8 -7 -10 -6 -3 -2 -1 +1 0 +11 +10 +9 +8 +6 +5 +4 +3 +2 +7 8 lose one calendar day add one calendar day 8 6 4 4 13 13 +12 -12 -12 +12 180 ° 150 ° E 120 ° E 90 ° E 60 ° E 30 ° E 0 ° 30 ° W 60 ° W 90 ° W 120 ° W 150 ° W 180 ° 2:00 24 00 4:00 6:00 8:00 10:00 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:00 22:00 24 00 Hours slow or fast of UT or Coordinated Universal Time 10 time zone Zones using UT (GMT) Zones slow of UT (GMT) International boundaries Zones fast of UT (GMT) Half-hour zones T ime zone boundaries International Date Line Actual Solar Time when time at Greenwich is 12:00 (noon) T AST ENCY PHI fin* 11/4/02 7:34 pm Page 408"},{"pageNumber":418,"pageContent":"receiving less warmth from its planet. Saturn’s other satel- lites are much smaller, so their gravity is insufficient for them to have clung on to any gas. Titan’s atmosphere shields its surface from radiation, so water-ice does not get broken down or liberated as a v apour, and the surface temperature of 90 K is far too cold for ice to evaporate naturally. Titan’s atmosphere is, therefore, both dry and free of oxygen. As a result, it con- tains compounds now extremely rare in the atmospheres of the TERRESTRIAL PLANETS , but which may have been abundant there originally. Compounds detected spectro- scopically include hydrocarbons, such as ethane (C 2 H 6 ), ethene (C 2 H 4 ), ethyne (C 2 H 2 ) and propane (C 3 H 8 ), and nitrogen compounds, such as hydrogen cyanide (HCN), cy anogen (C 2 N 2 ) and cyanoacetylene (HC 3 N). Many of these gases condense in Titan’s atmosphere, contributing to the smog that obscures the surface. The atmosphere’s orange colour is probably caused by these simple hydro- carbon molecules linking into longer chains by means of reactions triggered by solar ultraviolet radiation. Ethane could play a fascinating role in Titan’s meteo- rology, because condensed droplets of ethane should fall to the surface and collect there as liquid. If so, Titan’s cold and dark nature is made even more miserable by a contin- ual ethane drizzle. Winds blow at 100 m/s (330 ft/s) in Titan’s upper atmosphere, but there is currently no knowledge of the near-surface wind pattern. The strength of reflections from ground-based radar shows that Titan is not covered by a global ocean of ethane as was once believed. However, there could be widespread seas and lakes from which ethane could evap- orate back into the atmosphere in a cycle analogous to Earth’s water cycle. If it does rain ethane on Titan, there may be rivers as well as seas and lakes. Add to this an intri- cate weathering cycle, involving hydrocarbons mixed with or coating the surface ice, and the possibility of transport and reworking of surface material by the wind, and it becomes clear that Titan’s landforms could turn out to be strikingly Earth-like. See data at SATURN Titan IV Major US military satellite launcher. It began life as the Titan II Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, which still provides the core stage of the vehicle. The Titan IV is the latest and final upgrade of the Titan launch family. It comprises a Titan II core stage with new upper stages and two powerful strap-on solid rocket boosters. It is based on the design of the Titan 3C. The Titan IV first flew in 1989 and is available in six models of Titan IVA and IVB, without an upper stage or with IUS (Inertial Upper Stage) or Centaur upper stages. They are capable of placing 22 tonnes into low Earth orbit and up to 5.8 tonnes directly into geostationary orbit. The vehicle carries military optical and radar reconnaissance, missile early warning and communications satellites. By the end of 2001 Titan IV had made 26 successful and five failed launches. It will be retired from service in about 2003–2004, to be replaced by the heavier version of the DELTA IV. Titania Largest SATELLITE of URANUS . It was discovered in 1787 by William HERSCHEL , who found its neighbour OBERON in the same year. The best VOYA GER image of Titania is only good enough to show details down to about 7 km (4 mi) across. This indicates a surface that is more heavily cratered than ARIEL b ut less cratered than UMBRIEL or Oberon. It is traversed by fault scarps, 2–5 km (1–3 mi) high and up to 1500 km (900 mi) long. These faults may have the same origin as those on Ariel, b ut there are no visible signs that Titania’s faulted valleys have been flooded by CRYOVOLCANISM . Another indication that Titania has been active more recently than Umbriel and Oberon is that its largest craters have unusually low rims, as if the icy LITHOSPHERE lacked the strength to support such large features when they were formed.

T outatis APOLLO ASTEROID discovered in 1989; number 4179. Toutatis makes repeated close approaches to the Earth (to within 0.006 AU) because of its small orbital inclination (only half a degree). Radar imaging has shown it to be irregularly shaped, roughly 4.6 \u0001 2.4 \u0001 1.9 km (2.9 \u0001 1.5 \u0001 1.2 mi) in size. These images suggest that Toutatis is actually made up of two distinct rocky components in contact with each other and held together by self-gravity. Toutatis is also unusual in that rather than undergoing simple rotation about a principal axis, it actually tumbles as it moves along its orbit.

In most cases, the train – if present at all – lasts only a matter of a few seconds: those of less than a second’s duration are described as wakes. Trains are most commonly seen associated with bright meteors, and with meteors from cometary streams that impact on the upper a tmosphere at high velocities: the PERSEIDS , ORIONIDS and LEONIDS are each noted for their large proportion of train-producing events. Longer-duration trains may drift and undergo distortion in high-atmosphere winds, blowing at up to 400 km/hr (250 mph).

As the Earth turns on its axis, so the CELESTIAL SPHERE appears to rotate, completing one circuit in a SIDEREAL DAY . All celestial objects reach their g reatest altitude at the point they cross, or transit, the observer’s meridian (the north–south line that connects points of the same longitude). Transits of celestial bodies have always been important in measuring their position (using an instrument called a TRANSIT CIRCLE ) and for the determination of time. See also TIMEKEEPING transit (2) Passage of a celestial body, particularly one of the INFERIOR PLANETS , directly between the Sun and the Earth, crossing the Sun’s disk. Since their orbits are slightly inclined to the ecliptic, MERCURY and VENUS usually pass north or south of the Sun at INFERIOR CONJUNCTION . If CONJUNCTION occurs when the orbit of the inferior planet crosses the ecliptic ( see NODE ), then it is observed from Earth as a small, dark spot moving from east to west across the Sun’s disk. This is known as a transit. There are four phases during a tran- sit: two at the start (ingress) and two at the finish (egress). (i) First exterior contact occurs when the planet first appears to touch the Sun’s edge or limb; (ii) first internal contact is the point at which the planet is fully upon the Sun’s disk but still contiguous with its limb; (iii) second internal contact occurs when the planet touches the oppo- T T Orionis variable 410 \u0001 T otal Ozone Mapping Spectrometer In 2000 September, TOMS observed an enormous ‘hole’ in the ozone layer over the Antarctic (blue).

In the past, transit observations were used as a method of determining the ASTRONOMICAL UNIT . Transits of Mercury can only occur during May and November, the former being when the planet is near APHELION and the latter when it is close to PERIHELION . November events are twice as numerous as those in May but last for a shorter time; neither is visible to the naked eye. The interval between successive events varies from three to 13 years, with the next due in 2003 and 2006, and again in 2016 and 2019. Transits of Venus are very rare but occur in pairs, eight years apart, during June or December. The next events are due in 2004 and 2012, but then not again until 2117 and 2125. Unlike those of Mercury, transits of Venus are visible to the naked eye (although under no circumstances should an observer look directly at the Sun without using an approved, safe filter). transit (3) Passage of a planetary satellite across the disk of the parent planet. The four main moons of Jupiter can frequently be observed transiting its disk. The inner moons of Saturn transit its disk at times close to the rings’ edge-on presentation towards Earth. transit (4) Passage of an atmospheric or surface feature of a celestial body across its CENTRAL MERIDIAN as it rotates. Observations and timings of these transits provide a means of measuring the body’s period of rotation. This information can also be used to determine cloud motions relative to a standard reference frame for features on GAS GIANTS (principally Jupiter). See also SYSTEMS I AND II transit instrument (transit circle, meridian circle) TELE - SCOPE mounted so that it can only move about a fixed hor- izontal axis in a north–south plane. It can observe objects as they cross (transit) the MERIDIAN in order accurately to determine their positions. The simple transit instrument consists of a telescope fixed at right angles to a horizontal axis and free to rotate upon pivots on two fixed piers. The telescope can thus be moved up and down from horizon to horizon via the zenith, but not from side to side, so that its optical axis will always be in the plane of the observer’s meridian. A star or other celestial object is observed using cross-wires in the eyepiece of the transit instrument as it crosses the meridian and the exact time is recorded. When related to a fundamental reference frame, this time provides the star’s RIGHT ASCENSION or CELESTIAL LONGITUDE . Its ALTITUDE can be measured directly at the telescope from precisely graduated circles mounted on the horizontal axis and used to determine the star’s DECLINATION or CELESTIAL LATITUDE . An example of a modern transit instrument is the Carlsberg Meridian Circle at the RO QU ED ELOS MUCHA - CHOS OBSERVATORY on La Palma in the Canary Islands. This fully automated instrument is equipped with a CCD camera and is capable of accurately measuring the posi- tions of between 100,000 and 200,000 stars a night down to magnitude 17. Observations from it over a number of years have enabled the positions, PROPER MOTIONS and MAGNITUDES of some 180,000 stars down to magnitude 15 to be precisely determined. In addition, it has made 25,000 measurements of the positions and magnitudes of 180 Solar System objects including the planet Pluto and many asteroids. It was from these observations that a more precise orbit for Pluto was determined, thereby removing speculation about the existence of a ‘ PLANET X ’.

It is characterized by a large rise in temperature from about 20,000 to 1,000,000 K. The plasma density decreases as the temperature increases, keeping the pressure constant. Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) Satellite launched in 1998 April to perform the first US mission dedicated to solar science since the SOLAR MAXIMUM MISSION launched in 1980. TRACE takes high-resolution images of the TRANSITION REGION between the Sun’s chromosphere and the corona to obtain measurements of the temperature regimes, to complement data being collected by other spacecraft, including the SOLAR HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY . Scientists are also interested in the transition region because many of the physical phenomena that are found, such as plasma heating, arise throughout astrophysics. transmission grating DIFFRACTION GRATING made from transparent material, on the surface of which are a series of closely spaced, equidistant parallel grooves. A typical spacing density for the grooves is about 1000 per millimetre, and the size of the separation (about one micrometre) is not much bigger than the wavelength of light. Light of different wavelengths is transmitted through the grating in different directions (diffraction) creating a high-quality SPECTRUM .

Through to late 2001 more than 500 TNOs had been discovered.

Fo rmally classed as ASTEROIDS (minor planets), the TNOs are probably more similar to COMETS in nature than to main-belt asteroids, being composed largely of ices rather than rock and metal. Many of the TNOs occupy orbits with periods that are precise multiples of that of Neptune. This relationship leads to stability, as in the case of the orbital periods of Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which are in the ratio 6:3:2. The PLUTINOS are TNOs residing in the 3:2 resonance with Neptune, as does Pluto. Some astronomers regard the plutinos as being a separate population to the rest of the TNOs, in the same way as the Hilda asteroids are not considered to be part of the main belt. Although most TNOs are in near-circular orbits, about 10% of the currently known population have moderate to large eccentricities, with perihelia at 30–45 AU and aphelia at 60–200 AU. These bodies, termed scattered disk objects, have perhaps been pushed into higher-eccentricity orbits by non-collisional encounters with other TNOs. Some such objects may have been scattered into orbits with perihelia inside the orbit of Neptune, whereupon strong perturbations by that and, successively, the other giant planets may pass the objects inwards. The CENTAURS and perhaps some of the LONG - PERIOD ASTEROIDS are thought to have originated in this way.

The four brightest components, of mags. 5.1, 6.7, 6.7 and 8.0, form a trapezium shape easily seen with a small telescope. The two faintest stars are spectroscopic binaries with ranges of 0.8 and 0.5 mags. and periods of 65.4 and 6.5 days, respectively. Larger apertures reveal two additional stars in the group, of 11th magnitude. Like the Orion Nebula itself, the Trapezium lies about 1500 l.y. away. Treptow Observatory Public observatory in the south- eastern Berlin suburb of Treptow. It is formally known as the Archenhold Observatory in honour of its first director, Friedrich Simon Archenhold (1861–1939).

A permanent building was erected in 1910, and the telescope is still on public exhibition.

As the Earth revolves around the Sun the directions to nearby stars change relative to the distant, background stars. When observed six months apart from opposite sides of the Earth’s orbit, the position of a nearby star will appear to have shifted by an angle \u0001\u0002 . Half of this angle, \u0003 , gives the annual parallax, which is equal to the angle subtended at the observed star by the semimajor axis, or radius, of the Earth’s orbit, which is one astronomical unit (1 AU). Therefore, where d is the distance between the Sun and the star. The reciprocal of annual parallax in arcseconds ( \u0004 ) gi v es the distance to the star in P ARSECS (pc), a parsec being the distance at which a star would have a parallax of one arcsecond, so d =1/ \u0003 pc. The star Proxima Centauri has the largest known parallax, at 0 \u0004 .772, which is equiva- lent to a distance of 1.3 pc (4.22 l.y.). In practice, the parallax of a star is measured from observations taken about six months apart. Allowance is made for the PROPER MOTION of the star and the possibili- ty that some of the background stars may also have signif- icant parallaxes. The measurement is deemed ‘absolute’ when it has been corrected for the parallaxes of the back- g round stars. The astrometric satellite HIPPARCOS , which operated between 1989 and 1993, extended the range of accurate stellar parallax distances by roughly 10 times, at the same time increasing the number of stars with good parallaxes by a much greater factor. triple- \u0005 process NUCLEAR REACTION that converts helium to carbon by the near simultaneous combination of three \u0005 -particles (helium-4 nuclei). The next stage after the production of helium-4 from h ydrogen inside stars is not the production of beryllium-8, because that decays back to two \u0005 -particles in just 2 \u0006 10 \u0007 16 s, instead it is the triple- \u0005 reaction, producing carbon-12. The triple- \u0005 reaction involves two \u0005 -particles combining and then a third being added before the beryl- lium-8 can decay. It requires a temperature of about 10 8 K before it will start because the nuclear reactions involved are slightly endothermic (requiring the supply of energy) and therefore need the input of thermal energy to get them to occur. The triple- \u0005 reaction overall is exothermic: more energy is released by the process than is used in starting it, because the carbon-12 nucleus that is the result of the reaction is in an excited state and emits a high-ener- gy gamma ray. Additional helium captures can produce o xygen, neon and a number of heavier elements ( see NUCLEOSYNTHESIS ). The reaction is believed to be the dominant energy-generating process in RED GIANTS . triplet LENS assembly made up of three separate lenses that may or may not be cemented together but that work effectively as a single lens.

While Triton was being captured and its orbit made circular, any previous large satellites of Neptune would have been destroyed by mutual collisions or ejected from the Neptune system.

Tr iton’s surface is remarkably varied, as revealed on close-up images sent back by VOYA GER 2 in 1989. There are few impact craters, attesting to the young age of the surface. There are many signs of CRYOVOLCANISM , including long ridges, where viscous melts have oozed out, and a large tract, named ‘cantaloupe terrain’, that is pockmarked by 30-km-diameter (20 mi) dimples. The surface temperature of 38 K makes Triton the coldest body yet visited by a space probe. Spectroscopic obser- va tions have demonstrated the presence on the surface of ices formed from methane, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. Ammonia, which is almost impossible to detect, is probably present too. The scale of the topographic features demonstrates strength con- sistent with water ice, and presumably this lies beneath a thin veneer of the more exotic ices. Triton’s density sug- gests that a large rocky core occupies about two-thirds of its radius, and there may be a smaller iron-rich core in the middle. Tr iton has a complex 688-year-long cycle of seasons, resulting from a combination of Neptune’s 164-year orbit and Triton’s orbital inclination, which precesses ( see PRE - CESSION ) about Neptune’s axis of rotation. At the time of the Voyager 2 flyby it was high summer in Triton’s south- ern hemisphere. There was a large and apparently shrink- ing south polar cap of nitrogen ice, but the north polar region was in darkness. Triton has an extremely tenuous a tmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen. Its surface pres- sure doubled between 1989 and 1997, when it reached about 30 millionths of the Earth’s atmospheric pressure. Tr iton’s atmosphere is probably derived from the polar caps, and it must vary with the seasons as the sunlit polar cap shrinks by sublimation and the opposite cap grows by condensation. Voyager 2 saw several jets of gas bursting through the south polar cap and flinging columns of sooty particles to heights of about 8 km (5 mi), where they were deflected sideways by high altitude winds. These jets are probably solar-powered geysers rather than true cryovol- canic features powered by heat from within.

By 2001 more than a thousand such T rojan asteroids had been discovered, 62% of them at L 4 and 38% at L 5 . Unlike most other planet-crossing objects, the Trojan asteroids are dynamically stable, being protected from close approaches to Jupiter by their resonant orbits. It is believed that most of them have occupied their present locations since they formed from the SOLAR NEBULA at the same time as the rest of the solid bodies in the Solar System. Trojan asteroids associated with Saturn’s orbit have not been found, presumably because Jupiter’s gr a vitational perturbations render unstable the corresponding Lagrangian points for Saturn. There are, however, several MARS - TROJAN ASTEROIDS known. The first Trojan asteroid to be recognized was A CHILLES , in 1906; it was closely followed by PA TROCLUS and HEKTOR . It has recently been realised that a Trojan asteroid re-discovered as 1999 RM11 had been previously observed in 1904. tropical month Time taken for the Moon to complete a single revolution around the Earth, measured relative to the FIRST POINT OF ARIES ; it is equivalent to 27.32158 days of MEAN SOLAR TIME .

In 1930 he showed that the Milky Wa y’s globular clusters were reddened and dimmed, by 0.2 magnitudes for every 1000 l.y., by interstellar dust. He called this effect interstellar extinction. Trumpler carefully computed the sizes of, distances to and distribution of many clusters, discovering that their member stars belong to different ‘populations’ that reflect their average age. He w as a pioneer in measuring the radial velocities of stars in clusters, especially for the massive O stars T rumpler classification Classification of OPEN CLUSTERS using three criteria.

Between 1903 and 1929 he wrote many seminal papers on fundamental spaceflight technology, such as liquid propellants and multi-stage launch vehicles. Many of his ideas were collected in Investigations of Outer Space (1911) and Aims of Astronautics (1914). T siolkovsky Lunar crater (29ºS 129ºE). It is conspicuously dark as the only large (180 km/113 mi diameter) lava-filled crater on the lunar farside. T star New spectral class formally added to the cool end of the SPECTRAL CLASSIFICATION system (as were L STARS ) in 1999, making the sequence OBAFGKMLT. The class was needed because new infrared technologies w ere able to find stars that radiate almost entirely in the infrared. T stars, at the extreme cool end of the modern spectral sequence, are characterized principally by methane (CH 4 ) in their spectra. Absorptions by water and alkali metals, specifically neutral caesium, are also present. The first T star found, Gliese 229 B (companion to the class M1 red dwarf Gliese 229 A), has a temperature of only 1000 K and a mass estimated to be between 0.03 and 0.055 solar mass, making it also the first-known BROWN DWARF . Indeed, all the T stars are brown dwarfs (and are sometimes called ‘methane brown dwarfs’). Dwarfs that fuse hydrogen on the full proton–proton chain have higher masses and thus higher temperatures; they start their upward mass progression in class L. Evolved stars (giants and supergiants) cannot become as cool as class T. Little is understood about T stars. The class is not yet subdivided, and the full range of temperatures and masses is unknown. Chromospheric emission has been seen in spite of the low masses, fully convective natures and presumably low magnetic field strengths of the stars T Tauri star Ve ry y oung star still settling on to the MAIN SEQUENCE , typified by the V ARIABLE STAR T Tauri.

Many T Tauri stars show evidence of a strong, continu- ous flow of material from the surface of the star, known as the T Tauri wind. Other characteristics of these stars include the prox- imity of HERBIG – HARO OBJECTS , the presence of jets of gas, and perhaps the existence of an even younger com- panion star. T Tauri itself lies at the centre of a Her- big–Haro object. T Tauri stars are usually less massive than the Sun. Heavier stars either pass through the T Tauri phase while still obscured in their parent clouds or have a different appearance at the same stage of life.

Tunguska event Ve ry bright FIREBALL that was visible early in the morning of 1908 June 30 over the remote Tunguska region of Siberia. Contemporary reports record that explosions like thunder were heard. The first expedition to visit the area was in 1927, to search for the remnants of what was presumed to have been a meteorite impact. A crater was not found; instead there was an area of devastation c .60 km ( c .37 mi) across. In the centre, a belt of dead trees, which appeared to have been blasted in an intense forest fire, surrounded an approximately circular area of swamp. Up to 30 km (19 mi) farther out from the centre, trees had been flattened. The alignment of the trees, pointing radially outwards from the swamp, suggested that they had been felled by a shock wave. Only small particles of meteoritic material have been found in peat and in tree resin. It is assumed that an impactor, possibly c .50 m ( c .160 ft) across, exploded 6–8 km (4–5 mi) up in the atmosphere, and that radiation and shock wave from the explosion burnt and blew down the trees. It is still not certain whether the impactor was a comet or an asteroid. The energy of the impact has been estimated as c .10 17 J, which is equivalent to 50 million tonnes of TNT. tuning-fork diagram Diagram of GALAXY types, originated by Edwin HUBBLE . The ‘handle’ of the fork consists of elliptical galaxies (E), numbered according to their degree of elongation. The two prongs of the fork are made up of ordinary (S) and barred (SB) spirals, designated a, b, or c according to how tightly wound the spiral arms are. S0 or lenticular galaxies occur at the branch of the fork; they have both nonbarred and barred varieties and share stellar populations with elliptical galaxies. The classification was originally interpreted as a sequence of evolution, with ellipticals developing into spirals, but this is now known to be incorrect. Tu r ner, Herbert Hall (1861–1930) English astronomer who greatly advanced the precise determination and cata- loguing of star positions. Turner was Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford University (1894–1930), and a leader of the international CARTE DU CIEL photographic sky survey, which occupied him from 1887 to the end of his life. To expedite this massive undertaking, which required the Oxford astronomers to measure over 400,000 star images, Turner invented a measuring engine which replaced the usual micrometer screw with an eyepiece scale, greatly speeding up data analysis. He was the first to make use of the coelostat to observe solar eclipses, obtain- ing some of the first detailed spectra of the inner corona. turnoff point Point on the HERTZSPRUNG – RUSSELL DIAGRAM (HR diagram) where a star evolves off the MAIN SEQUENCE . The turnoff point depends on the initial STELLAR MASS : both luminosity and temperature of the turnoff point increase with stellar mass. Stellar age also depends on the initial stellar mass: the more massive the star, the quicker it burns its core hydrogen and the shorter time it spends on the main sequence. Plotting stars belonging to a GLOBULAR CLUSTER on an HR diagram gives a distinct turnoff point which can be used to determine the age of the cluster. Tuttle, Comet 8P/ Short-period comet originally discovered by Pierre MÉCHAIN on 1790 January 8. The comet was re-discovered on 1858 January 5 by Horace TUTTLE , and over the next two months sufficient observations were obtained to confirm its identity with the 1790 object. It was successfully recovered in October 1871. The orbital period is 13.51 years, and 8P/Tuttle was last seen in 1993. The comet is the parent of the URSID meteor stream. twenty-one centimetre line EMISSION LINE of neutral hydrogen in interstellar space, resulting from the energy difference between two sublevels of the lowest energy state of hydrogen.

Neutral atomic hydrogen will be in its lowest possible energy state in interstellar space, and it is this that can be mapped using the 21 cm line, to show the distribution of hydrogen gas throughout the Galaxy. Radio waves penetrate the interstellar dust with ease, and so the 21 cm line can be observed from everywhere in the Galaxy, including the centre and the far side of the Galaxy.

T ycho Lunar crater (43ºS 11ºW), 87 km (54 mi) in diameter. Tycho is a complex crater with side-wall terracing and central peaks. This recent crater has a bright ray pattern, extending out for hundreds of kilometres. Extensive secondary impact fields are visible in the surrounding terrain. The EJECTA appear dark, probably from minerals dredged up in the cratering process. T ycho Brahe See BRAHE , TYCHO T ycho Catalogue (TYC) See HIPPARCOS CATALOGUE T ychonian system GEOCENTRIC THEORY of the Uni- ve r se suggested by Tycho BRAHE in 1583. After the pub- lication of Copernicus’ heliocentric theory in 1543, astronomers were divided between the PTOLEMAIC SYS - TEM and the new COPERNICAN SYSTEM . While the Earth- centred Universe seemed to accord with common sense and the geocentric physics of ARISTOTLE , placing the Sun at the centre accounted straightforwardly for the planets’ retrograde motions and other phenomena. T ycho, a great admirer of Copernicus, realized that the question could be decided only by acquiring better observational data, and he developed instruments with which angular measurements of unprecedented accura- cy could be made. However, Tycho could detect no P ARALLAX or any other sign of the Earth’s motion in space. He therefore devised a cosmology that kept the Earth immobile at the centre of the Universe, but with the Moon and Sun revolving around it, and all the other planets revolving around the Sun. This was an ingenious compromise: his solar centre of planetary motion incorporated Coperni- can explanations of the retrograde motions, while his fixed Earth explained why heavy terrestrial bodies fall downwards. The Tychonian system soon gained many adherents. Although rejected by Galileo, it could still explain such Galilean phenomena as the phases of V enus. Not until after 1670 did the weight of observa- tional evidence swing decisively from the Tychonian sys- tem towards the Copernican. T ycho’s Star First SUPERNOVA whose position and changing brightness were accurately estimated, with important observations having been made by Tycho BRAHE .

The primary minimum lasts just under 10 hours and occurs every 2.493 days. The period of the star is slowly increasing, and also shows some irregular, spontaneous variations. The system consists of two stars moving in a nearly circular orbit. The smaller of the two stars is brighter and more massive; it is of spectral type B8V and has a mass 4.7 times that of the Sun. The larger component is a G-type giant star, with a mass only 1.9 times that of the Sun. A stream of gas is flowing from the larger, less dense star. This slows the rotation of the large star and speeds up the smaller, more massive companion. The surfaces of the two stars are only about 10 million km (6 million mi) apart, just about the same as the diameter of the giant star. U Geminorum star (USGS) Subtype of V ARIABLE STAR ; they are also known as SS Cygni stars, after the brightest member, and as DW ARF NOVAE , along with the z CAMELOPARDALIS STARS and SU URSAE MAJORIS STARS . U Geminorum stars are named after the prototype, discovered by John Russell Hind (1823–95) in 1855. Almost 400 are now known. They are characterized by rapid outbursts of between 2 to 6 magnitudes, followed by a slower return to minimum, where they remain until the next outburst. Pe r iods range from 10 days to several years and are fairly constant when averaged out over many cycles, but there may be considerable variations in both period and brightness from one cycle to the next. Members of the SU Ursae Majoris subclass have both normal maxima and ‘supermaxima’, which last about five times as long and are twice as bright. Another group, with periods between 50 and 80 days, sometimes show anomalous maxima in which the rise takes several days, instead of the usual day or so. Almost all U Geminorum stars show rapid irregular flickering of around mag. 0.5 at minimum. Because they are all binaries, some also show eclipses at minimum. All are close binaries, comprising a subgiant or dwarf star of type K to M, which has filled its R OCHE LOBE , and a WHITE DWARF surrounded by an A CCRETION DISK of infalling matter. Variations in the flow of matter and/or variations in the atmospheres are thought to cause the outbursts. The longer the period of the star, the greater the variation, which suggests a relationship with the RECURRENT NOVAE , though the physical basis for this, if any, is unclear. There have been suggestions that U Geminorum stars evolve from W URSAE MAJORIS va r iables but this remains speculative. At minimum the spectra of U Geminorum stars show wide emission lines, which during the brightening merge g radually into the continuous background, reappearing at maximum as absorption lines. At least two possible U Geminorum stars have been found in globular clusters (M5 and M30).

The regions from 380 to 310 nm (near-ultraviolet) and from 90 to 10 nm (extreme-ultraviolet) are also included in this area. The interstellar medium becomes opaque at 91.2 nm, the limit to the Lyman series of the hydrogen atom, but the gas is patchy and inhomogeneous so astronomical objects can be detected in the extreme-ultraviolet range. Many stars and galaxies emit in the ultraviolet and the main strength of ultraviolet astronomy has been SPECTROSCOPY , especially that provided by the INTERNATIONAL ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER (IUE) satellite, with over 104,000 spectra. Ultraviolet astronomy probes the physics and chemistry of hot gas around stars, nebulae and the interstellar medium, since the spectra provide information about motion, rotation and winds. The ozone high in the STRATOSPHERE of Earth’s a tmosphere absorbs electromagnetic radiation at wa v elengths shorter than 300 nm, making ground-based observations of the ultraviolet impossible. Early experiments (down to 200 nm) were possible from balloon platforms, which could reach altitudes of 45 km (28 mi). The first satellite experiments involved studying the ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, culminating in an American series of satellites, the Orbiting Solar Observatories (OSO). Other early satellites included the American COPERNICUS satellite, the European TD-1 and the Dutch ANS satellites. The INTERNATIONAL ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER (IUE) was launched in 1978 and operated until 1996. A conventional aluminium-coated mirror cannot be used for ultraviolet astronomy because aluminium oxide absorbs ultraviolet radiation at wa v elengths shorter than 160 nm. Alternatives such as magnesium fluoride or lithium fluoride are often used. When the EXTREME ULTRAVIOLET EXPLORER (EUVE) satellite, operating between 1 and 100 nm, was launched in 1992, it detected hundreds of sources, hot stars and even some extragalactic sources. Several other satellites have been launched, including the FA RU L TRAVIOLET SPECTROSCOPIC EXPLORER (FUSE) and the extreme- ultraviolet (EUV) camera on R OSAT ; the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE (HST) has ultraviolet capabilities because it is sensitive in the wavelength range 110 to 2500 nm. There have also been ultraviolet astronomy experiments aboard the SPACE SHUTTLE , including the Hopkins Ultraviolet T elescope (HUT). Ultraviolet observations contribute to all branches of astronomy. Most atoms and ions found between the stars have their strongest resonance ABSORPTION LINES in the ultraviolet. Observations in this wavelength region have, therefore, been significant for studies of the composition and motions of the interstellar gas. Discoveries include the wa y in which some elements are depleted from the gas, with the atoms sticking on to interstellar grains, and the existence in the interstellar gas of highly ionized regions, which may be ‘fossil’ supernova remnants. An extensive ionized halo to our Galaxy has also been discovered.

HUT and EUVE examined the Venus EUV (extreme- ultraviolet) dayglow emission, and FUSE has discovered molecular hydrogen (H 2 ) at 107 nm in the Martian a tmosphere. Striking results have come from the observations of comets. IUE observed comets Halley and Iras–Araki–Alcock. The data revealed the way in which the gases spread out from the cometary nucleus and are g radually dissociated and ionized by the solar radiation. These studies also reveal details of the composition of the cometary material itself. Such studies are important because comets may be samples of material unchanged since the formation of the Solar System. Ultraviolet astronomy has also been important for the study of stars. Many hot stars show strong stellar winds, and binary stars transfer material from one star to the other. In both cases EMISSION LINES in the ultraviolet region provide information on the nature of the flows and their effect on the evolution of the stars concerned. In extreme cases the massive, hot star is losing a significant amount of material in its wind, perhaps more than 10 \u0001 6 solar masses/year, and this wind makes a noticeable impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. In addition, the emission spectra of gas nebulae excited by the radiation from hot stars pose interesting spectroscopic problems and lead to accurate measurements of abundances of materials, like carbon, which have few strong spectral lines at optical wavelengths. The ROSAT EUV camera showed the local bubble of high-temperature (around 10,000 K) gas around the Sun, with the region of lowest absorption by the gas in the direction of Canis Major, where tunnel-like structures permeate the bubble w all. Hot white dwarfs emit strongly in the ultraviolet and EUVE has catalogued over 400 of them. When white dwarfs are members of binary star systems, the radiation from their hot accretion disks is also very bright in the ultraviolet. Ultraviolet astronomy has also shown that coronae and transition regions are absent for stars cooler than a certain limit: this is thought to reflect a difference in the details of the stellar wind flows from these stars. Ultraviolet astronomy has made important contributions to extragalactic studies. First, it was shown that in many ways the ultraviolet spectra of nearby active galaxies resemble very closely those of the quasars whose ultraviolet spectra are seen from the ground by virtue of the redshift. Secondly, the stellar content of galaxies has been studied in the ultraviolet, where the galaxy spectrum is sensitive to the presence of hot stars in the galaxy. But perhaps one of the most spectacular results in this field is the work on the variations of the ultraviolet spectrum of the active galaxy NGC 4151, which led to an estimate of 1000 million solar masses for the weight of the black hole in the nucleus of the galaxy. ultraviolet excess Excess signal in the NEAR - ULTRAVIOLET and blue (originally measured in the J ohnson UBV photometric system) when compared to normal stars (often defined by the Hyades cluster). It showed whether a star or sample of stars lacked heavy elements (metals), so they could be defined as ‘metal- poor’. If there were fewer heavy elements, there were fewer absorption lines in the near-ultraviolet, hence the excess emission. ultraviolet radiation Wa v elength range from around 380 nm beyond the visible violet down to 90 nm, the limit of the L YMAN SERIES of hydrogen lines, with the region from around 90 to 10 nm called the extreme-ultraviolet. The region from 380 to 310 nm (known as the NEAR - ULTRAVIOLET ) can be observed from the ground, and beyond this observations must be made from satellites or balloons. Ultraviolet radiation is strongly absorbed by glass, so lenses are made from quartz or fluorite. Ulugh Beg (1393–1449) Islamic Turkish ruler of Maverannakhr (now Uzbekistan) and astronomer, whose name means ‘great prince’; his real name was Muhammad Taragi ibn Shah-Rukh ibn-Timur.

Its instruments included the Fakhri 60 \u0002 sextant – the largest transit instrument ever b uilt, made of marble and standing 40 m (130 ft) tall. The Fakhri was used by Beg and his assistants to measure the altitudes of stars as they crossed the meridian to an accuracy of a few arcseconds and to calculate the obliquity of the ecliptic very precisely.

Umbriel Icy SATELLITE of URANUS . It was discovered in 1851 by William LASSELL , who found its neighbour ARIEL in the same year. Umbriel is Ariel’s near-twin in size and is only slightly less dense; it is curious, therefore, that it should appear so different. Similarities would perhaps be revealed if images were available of the unseen two-thirds of each globe. As its name suggests, Umbriel is darker than the other large satellites of Uranus, having an albedo of 0.19. The imaged part of the globe is much more heavily cratered, and therefore older, than the cratered terrain on Ariel. Its dark colour could be a result of exceptional radiation- darkening of methane with age or a particularly high carbon content. The only bright material visible on Umbriel is the floor of the 150-km-diameter (90-mi) crater Wunda and in the central peak of the 110-km- diameter (70-mi) crater Vuver, both of which have albedos of about 0.5.

A sea-level headquarters was built in nearby Hilo. Today, UKIRT is the responsibility of the JOINT ASTRONOMY CENTRE in Hilo. Instrumentation developed for the telescope at Edinburgh during the 1980s pioneered novel techniques of imaging and spectroscopy in the infrared. It gave this branch of astronomy similar capabilities to optical astronomy. A wide-field infrared camera allows large-area surveys to be carried out. United Kingdom Schmidt Telescope (UKST) Large SCHMIDT TELESCOPE inaugurated in 1973 at SIDING SPRING OBSERVATORY in central New South Wales, Australia. With its 1.2-m (48-in.) corrector plate and 1.8-m (72-in.) spherical mirror, the instrument was modelled on the OSCHIN SCHMIDT TELESCOPE at Palomar Observatory. The UKST was an outstation of the RO YA L OBSERVATORY , EDINBURGH until 1988, when its close relationship with the nearby ANGLO - AUSTRALIAN TELESCOPE was formalized and it became part of the ANGLO - AUSTRALIAN OBSERVATORY . Its principal task during its first two decades was to conduct photographic surveys of the entire southern sky in various wavebands, which were then digitized at Edinburgh. In the early 1980s, experiments with fibre optics led to new modes of operation for the telescope, culminating in 2001 with the deployment of a robotic 150-object spectroscopy system known as 6dF.

Pulses of laser light are reflected off artificial satellites in known Earth orbits, allowing the position of the laser telescope relative to the satellite, and hence the rotation of the Earth, to be measured to a high degree of accuracy ( see SATELLITE LASER RANGER ). This measure of the Earth’s rate of rotation provides a timescale designated UT0. This timescale is dependent upon the location the observations were made from and has to be corrected for the shift in longitude caused by the slight wandering of the Earth’s geographical poles ( POLAR MOTION ). The corrected timescale is called UT1 and it is this that is generally implied when the term UT is used. COORDINATED UNIVERSAL TIME (UTC) is a uniform AT OMIC TIME scale, based on caesium-beam atomic clocks; it is the basis of civil time. Because the Earth’s rate of rotation is gradually slowing due to the effects of tidal braking, UTC and UT1 are gradually diverging. In order to keep them linked, and thus ensure that time as kept by a clock is in step with that as measured by the position of the Sun in the sky, a LEAP SECOND is periodically introduced to UTC to keep it within 0.9 second of UT1.

These rolled up dimensions also constitute a part of our Universe, but we do not see them as a normal dimension, rather we feel their effects as forces or fields. Another common misconception is that spacetime and matter must be expanding out into ‘something’ or that spacetime warps in another dimension by mass. Since this dimension or direction is not within our Universe, it can never be seen or experienced by definition; thus its characteristics are irrelevant. The singularity in a BLACK HOLE , although consisting of infinitely warped spacetime, remains part of our Universe although a signal cannot escape. However, some ideas in GENERAL RELATIVITY claim that black holes, if combined with a black hole in another universe, can form a bridge or W ORMHOLE to another universe under special conditions. Additionally, some interpretations of quantum theory state that every time a wave function is collapsed, in other w ords something is measured, a new universe is created. In the case of tossing a coin, if it comes up heads it is in one universe, but there is another universe created where it came out tails. Most quantum theorists do not take seriously this multi-universe idea of the so-called Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, but theoretically there is no reason why it cannot be true. University of Arizona Department of Astronomy See STEWARD OBSERVATORY unsharp masking Photographic technique used for revealing fine detail in astronomical images. The process involves making a positive contact copy of the negative image on a glass photographic plate using low-contrast film. The film is placed in contact with the back of the original plate and a diffuse light source used, producing a blurred copy of the large-scale structure from the original plate. When replaced in contact with the back of the glass plate, the blurred image of the unsharp mask cancels out the large scale structure on the original, revealing the fine detail. Unsöld, Albrecht Otto Johannes (1905–95) German astrophysicist who, from the 1920s, used quantum physics to improve the modelling of stellar atmospheres. He was thus able to explain the behaviour of the h ydrogen atoms that produce the Balmer lines in the solar spectrum (1929). For this research, Unsöld obtained high-resolution spectroheliograms with Mount Wilson’s 45-m (150-ft) tower telescope; subsequently, he obtained high-resolution spectra of other stars as a visiting scientist at Yerkes and McDonald Observatories. His long-term investigations of the BO star \u0001 Scorpii yielded the first highly detailed analysis of a stellar a tmosphere to discuss the phenomena of spectral line shifts and pressure broadening. Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) First spacecraft of the NASA Mission to Planet Earth programme; it was at the time the largest ever flown for a tmospheric research. It was deployed into Earth orbit by the Space Shuttle in 1991 September. It investigates the mechanisms controlling the structure and variability of the upper atmosphere to help create a comprehensive database in order better to understand the depletion of ozone in the stratosphere. UARS helped confirm that man-made chlorofluorocarbons are responsible for the depletion of ozone. The spacecraft was equipped with ten instruments, some of which have failed. upper culmination Pass age of a CIRCUMPOLAR STAR across the MERIDIAN between the POLE and the ZENITH .

The present building in central Uppsala dates from 1853, when it replaced the old Celsius Observatory of 1741. In 2000 the Astronomy Department vacated the 1853 observatory building and moved to a new laboratory in the city, having merged with the Department of Space Physics. An outstation at Kvistaberg Observatory, 50 km (30 mi) south of Uppsala, has a 1.0-m Schmidt telescope; the 0.5-m (20- in) Schmidt of the former Uppsala Southern Station at SIDING SPRING OBSERVATORY , Australia, is now operated on behalf of NASA for near-Earth object searches. Uraniborg First observatory constructed on the Danish island of Hven by Tycho BRAHE during 1576-80; the name means ‘Castle of the Heavens’. It included accommodation, a library, an instrument workshop and even a printing press. See also STJERNEBORG Uranus Seventh planet in the Solar System, the first to be discovered telescopically. In 1781 William HERSCHEL , observing from Bath, was examining the small stars in the neighbourhood of H Geminorum when he found a star ‘visibly larger than the rest’, which he suspected to be a comet. As no one had previously discovered a planet this view is understandable. Uranus is the third largest of the major planets. It is more than four times the size of the Earth and 14 times more massive. 421 U \u0001 Uranus Cloud features on Uranus are fairly elusive.

It is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, in approximately solar proportions, with small amounts of methane, ammonia and their photochemical products. Uranus has a greenish visual appearance, due to the absorption of sunlight in the blue/green portions of the spectrum by methane gas in its a tmosphere. Uranus is also thought to contain heavier materials, such as oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, silicon and iron. Beneath the extensive layers of clouds, there is thought to be an ocean of super- heated water, forming a ‘mantle’ overlying the Earth- sized rocky core. It has been suggested that this extensive ocean may have originated from A CCRETION of billions of cometary planetesimals, primarily composed of aqueous materials and found in large numbers in the outer parts of the Solar System during its early formation. The numerous collisions and high pressure of the region where the water is currently located accounts for its super-heated state. Uranus’ axis of rotation is tilted by 97°52 \u0001 with respect to its orbit. Consequently, it is unique in our Solar System since its axis of rotation is close to its orbital plane. In its motion around the Sun, each pole is presented towards the Sun and the Earth. During the encounter by the VOYA GER 2 spacecraft in 1986 January, the south pole of the planet w as directed towards the oncoming probe and the Earth. The evolution of this axial tilt is probably a result of collisions with planetesimals early during the planet’s formation – a major collision after the planet had grown to a large size would have disrupted it. A possible candidate for these collisions is a swarm of comets, an event that w ould also be consistent with the deep oceans of super- heated water in the interior of Uranus. This unusual interior structure may also account for Uranus not possessing a significant internal heat source, in contrast to the other jovian planets, Jupiter, Saturn and Neptune. Since Uranus is so distant from the Earth, the Voyager 2 spacecraft encounter provided a dramatic increase in the understanding of it. The planetary magnetic field is extraordinary, since it is inclined at 60º to the rotational axis of the planet. The dipole field has a strength of 0.25 G, which compares with field strengths of 0.21 G at Saturn and 0.31 G at the Earth. Uranus’ is the most inclined magnetic field in the Solar System, with a correspondingly large difference from the planetary rotational axis. It is possible that the magnetic field may be in some stage of reversing its polarity, which is currently south-seeking towards the Earth. The planet has an extensive MAGNETOSPHERE , which stretches for more than 18 R U and contains a hot plasma environment with temperatures reaching more than 10,000 K. There is a complicated interaction between this hostile region, containing the trapped charged particles, and the embedded rings, satellites and the upper atmosphere of the planet. The magnetosphere sweeps away tiny particles from the rings and affects the chemistry of the satellites by heating their surfaces by particle bombardment. On the sunlit side of the planet there is an intense electroglow, while on the dark side auroral activity is detected through these magnetospheric/atmospheric interactions, which are also related to a huge glow in the atmosphere, spreading outwards for about 2 R U (50,000 km/31,000 mi). Uranus, like Jupiter and Saturn, has a banded appearance, which is barely visible from Earth. The cloud motions reveal a predominantly zonal circulation, where the winds are blowing in a east–west direction rather than from north to south. This circulation resembles the flow on Jupiter and Saturn and, to a lesser extent, the motions on every planet in the Solar System. The motions are zonal in spite of the substantial differences in their solar heating distributions, confirming that it is the rotation of the planet that organizes the weather systems. Unlike all the other planets, however, the polar regions are slightly wa r mer than the equatorial regions of the planet. Extensive haze layers, created photochemically and composed of acetylene and ethane particles, obscure the major weather systems on Uranus. During the Voyager 2 encounter, several discrete clouds composed of methane particles were seen in the southern mid-latitudes, at the 1- 2 bar pressure level. Some of these clouds resemble the convective systems seen on Earth. The temperature at the cloud-top levels is approximately 64 K. There is a small seasonal variation of about 5 K in the cloud-top temperatures, but this will have a negligible effect on the meteorological systems since the Uranus atmosphere responds sluggishly to solar radiation, like a very deep ocean. Although the upper clouds are composed of methane, layers of ammonia, ammonia polymers and wa ter clouds may exist deeper in the atmosphere. Uranus is now known to possess at least 21 satellites. The five main satellites, MIRANDA , ARIEL , UMBRIEL , TITANIA and OBERON , were discovered during Earth- based telescopic observations. These satellites have densities in the range 1.26–1.5 g/cm 3 and are probably, therefore, composed mainly of water ice and rock, with small amounts of methane clathrate. However, they do appear to have varied surfaces. Oberon, Titania and Umbriel are the least geologically active of the satellite family, with Umbriel the darkest and most inactive of this set. The tectonic activity increases from Ariel to Miranda, which both show evidence of surfaces with fracture patterns, scarps, valleys and layered terrains. Miranda has the appearance of a body reassembled following a major collision at some earlier stage in its existence, with features resembling the grooves of Ganymede, the canyons of Mars and the compressional faults of Mercury, all on this tiny body. The 10 new satellites all reside in the region between Miranda and the rings, with ureilites 422 U \u0001 Uranus The rings of Uranus were discovered during observations from the Kuiper Airborne Observatory of a stellar occultation by the planet in 1977. A series of dips in the star’s brightness prior to its disappearance behind the planet indicated the presence of the rings. Similar dips were seen after the star re-emerged from behind the planet, confirming that the occulting material was in rings extending around Uranus.

These satellites range in size from about 15–170 km (9–110 mi) in diameter. All are surprisingly dark, with albedos of only about 0.05. It is possible that the darkness of all the satellites and the rings is caused by their bombardment by charged particles in the magnetosphere, which alters their surface heating and chemistry. Stellar occultation observations in 1977 provided the first evidence of a system of nine rings around Uranus. Tw o further rings were found during the Voyager 2 encounter. This ring system extends from 37,000–51,000 km (23,000–32,000 mi) from Uranus’ centre, although there appear to be hundreds of very thin r ings and ring arcs around the planet. The Epsilon ring seems to be composed of 1 m (3 ft) boulders rather than the micrometre-size particles typical of the rings of Jupiter and Saturn. It is perhaps surprising that only one pair of shepherding satellites have been found so far, namely Cordelia and Ophelia, which are adjacent to the Epsilon r ing. It is likely that smaller satellites, currently below the level of detection, do exist, shepherding the other rings. ureilites Enigmatic group of A CHONDRITE meteorites. Ureilites are carbon-rich igneous rocks, the origin of which is uncertain. They have been described either as partial melt residues or as igneous cumulates.

Over long periods of time the motion of these two stars will distort the present star pattern. The other five stars share the same basic motion through the Galaxy, forming a MOVING CLUSTER , and have about the same distance from us. They resemble a very open cluster of a few stars.

Sirius is one such star, and others include \u0003 Leonis, \u0004 Aurigae, \u0004 Eridani and \u0002 Coronae Borealis. In total about 100 members of this MOVING GROUP are known. Many are widely scattered across the sky from Ursa Major. Their separation in space is moderately large, certainly larger than in a normal cluster. Our Sun is taking us through the outskirts of the group, which is why its member stars can appear on all sides of the sky.

Many ancient northern cultures pic- tured a bear in this part of the sky. In Greek mythology these stars represent either Callisto, who fell victim to Juno’s passion, was turned into a bear and was then placed by Zeus in the sky for safety; or Adrastea, a Cretan nymph who raised the infant Zeus and whom he placed among the stars in gratitude. It is easily recog- nized by the asterism of the PLOUGH (Big Dipper), the five central stars of which are part of the URSA MAJOR MOVING CLUSTER . Ursa Major’s brightest star, ALIOTH , is mag. 1.8.

V alles Marineris Series of enormous, interconnected canyons on MARS , situated between 30ºW and 110ºW, just south of the Martian equator. These canyons, produced by extensive faulting of the crust, extend from the crest of THARSIS MONTES to the vicinity of CHRYSE PLANITIA , a distance of 4500 km (2800 mi). In the west the canyon system emerges from Noctis Labyrinthus then trends approximately west–east. The main section of the system comprises a number of parallel, straight-sided chasms, beginning in the west with Ius Chasma and Tithonium Chasma. The central section sees both the widest and deepest expression: here three vast troughs, each 200 km (120 mi) wide and up to 7 km (4 mi) deep, slice through the plains. At the eastern end the canyons pass into chaotic terrain. Ophir Chasma and Candor Chasma are situated to the north of the central canyon complex. The west and east ends of Ophir Chasma are both rather blunted and the trend of the canyon walls is continued laterally by lines of crater chains, indicating an underlying structural control. Spacecraft images reveal the existence not only of erosional debris but also of rhythmically layered deposits, which, by analogy with terrestrial rocks, would be expected to have been laid down in quiet conditions beneath a cover of water. Such deposits are seen generally to form flat-topped hills (mesas) or irregular blocks within the troughs. The mesas and canyon walls are finely stratified by both light and dark materials on a scale of a few metres, indicating a complex geological history. Very recent evidence points to the deposition of the layered strata prior to the large- scale faulting that gave rise to the canyon system.

V an Allen belts RADIATION BELT regions in the terrestrial MAGNETOSPHERE in which charged particles are trapped as they spiral along the magnetic field and bounce up and down between reflection points located towards the magnetic poles. These regions were discovered in 1958 by James Van Allen on analysis of Geiger counter data from the EXPLORER 1 satellite. The inner region of the V an Allen belts is located between 1000 and 5000 km (600 and 3000 mi) above the equator; it contains protons and electrons, which are either captured from the SOLAR WIND or originate from collisions between upper a tmosphere atoms and high-energy COSMIC RAYS . The outer belt region is located between 15,000 and 25,000 km (9000 and 16,000 mi) above the equator, but it curves downwards towards the magnetic poles. This region contains mainly electrons from the solar wind. The V an Allen belts are a potential hazard to Earth-orbiting spacecraft, since the radiation levels are high enough to have an adverse effect on the electronic subsystems and on-board instrumentation, especially following a GEOMAGNETIC STORM . Similar radiation belt regions of trapped, charged particles have been discovered around Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

He has spent most of his career (1951– ) at the University of Iowa, investigating Solar System radiation and magnetic fields. After World War II, he used captured German V-2 rockets to measure cosmic rays, inventing the ‘rockoon’ method of reaching far greater altitudes than previously possible by launching rockets first carried to high altitude by balloons. An organizer of the INTERNATIONAL GEOPHYSICAL YEAR , he analysed data from the early Explorer spacecraft to map two torus-shaped regions of radiation above the Earth’s equator now named the VA N ALLEN BELTS . More recently, he and his colleagues have made detailed studies of SOLAR – TERRESTRIAL INTERACTIONS . In all, Van Allen has served as principal investigator for 24 different space missions.

He moved to the United States when Belgium was invaded in World War I. At Yerkes, he used the 40-inch (1-m) telescope to carefully re-observe 1200 double stars identified at Lick Observatory by William Joseph Hussey (1862–1926). During his long career, Van Biesbroeck preferred computing and refining orbits of known pairs to seeking new doubles.

Vandenberg Air Force Base US military launch facility about 240 km (150 mi) north-west of Los Angeles, operated by the US Air Force Space Command’s 30th Space Wing. It began as a US Army training centre in 1941 but from 1957 was developed as the nation’s first space and ballistic missile operations and training base under the Air Force. In 1958 it was renamed to honour General Hoyt S. Vandenberg. The base supports west-coast launches for the NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) and commercial contractors as well as the Air Force and the Department of Defense. All US spacecraft destined for near-polar orbit are launched from Vandenberg. Van Maanen, Adriaan (1884–1946) Dutch-American astronomer who conducted astrometric and spectroscopic studies at Mount Wilson Observatory (1912–46). There, he used the 60- and 100-inch (1.5- and 2.5-m) telescopes to make a comprehensive survey of parallaxes for 500 starfields. He discovered Van Maanen’s Star , a nearby 12th-magnitude white dwarf. He also made many measurements of proper motions, among them many Cepheid variables, thus helping to determine the scale of the Galaxy. This led Van Maanen to extend his earlier research on star streaming, carried out with Jacobus KAPTEYN , to determine which stars belong to Double Cluster in Perseus, the Pleiades and Hyades, and other clusters. This work greatly extended our knowledge of the density and luminosity of stars in the solar neighbourhood. variable star Star whose brightness changes with time. These variations in light may be the result of some inherent feature in a star or its atmosphere, or of some geometrical alignment. The former are termed INTRINSIC VARIABLES ; the latter EXTRINSIC VARIABLES . There are about 35,000 known variable stars and at least 15,000 objects that are suspected to vary in light, but have not yet been confirmed. These numbers do not include variables in GLOBULAR CLUSTERS or those in other galaxies. A few variable stars are known by their Greek letters or proper names, for example \u0002 Orionis ( BETELGEUSE ). The system of naming variable stars is to assign the letter R to the first discovered in a constellation; the second becomes S and so on down to Z. Then comes RR to RZ, SS to SZ, and so on. This sequence ends at ZZ, after which comes AA to AZ, BB to BZ and so on down to QZ, but the letter J is never used. After QZ the next variable in any constellation would be the 335th: it becomes V335, and each subsequent variable in that constellation gets a higher number. The letters and numbers are followed by the name of the constellation. Early discoveries of variables were made visually and a few are still discovered by this method. However, most discoveries result from conventional or CCD photography. Tw o images taken of the same region of the sky may be placed in a blink or stereo COMPARATOR , which ensures that any difference in a star is soon noticed. CCD images may be compared electronically with a reference image of the same area of sky. The plates, films or images must be taken some time apart and with the same instrument and, if possible, under the same sky conditions. Va r iable-star work is a field in which a large contribution is made by amateur astronomers, working in co-operation with central organizations such as the AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF VARIABLE STAR OBSERVERS (AAVSO), the BRITISH ASTRONOMICAL ASSOCIATION (BAA) or the ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY OF NEW ZEALAND (RASNZ). There are so many variable stars that the professional astronomers can only observe a few. They wish to select those stars that pose special problems, or to observe them at certain phases of their light variations. As a result, they rely on amateurs to provide data that will enable them to select the stars that interest them and to provide light- curves and predictions for the more regular variables so that they can select the phases that they wish to observe. The amateur astronomers are thus able to make a very valuable contribution by consistently following these stars. The intrinsic variables are divided into many classes, each of which has a number of divisions depending on the way in which the stars change in brightness or because of some other property inherent in them. Broadly speaking, there are seven classes. The first are called ERUPTIVE VARIABLES because of violent processes taking place in their chromospheres and coronae. The resultant flares are often accompanied by shell events, as matter is carried off by stellar winds, and by interaction with the interstellar matter that surrounds the star. Typical examples are the various types of Orion variables. The second class are the pulsating variables, which have fairly regular expansion and contraction of their surface layers. MIRA STARS and the many types of CEPHEIDS belong to this class. The third class consists of rotating stars, with light variations resulting from their axial rotation or from starspots or some feature of their atmospheres caused by a magnetic field. This class includes both intrinsic stars and extrinsic variables. The fourth class comprises the explosive or CATACLYSMIC VARIABLES such as NOVAE , SUPERNOVAE and DW ARF NOVAE . The fifth class comprises the ECLIPSING BINARY systems such as the Algols, which are really extrinsic variables. The sixth class consists of X-ray sources in which the variability is in the X-ray radiation. Finally, there is a seventh class, which consists of unique objects that cannot be assigned to any other type. Included in this class are the BL LACERTAE OBJECTS and optically varying QU ASARS , which are, of course, extragalactic objects. The observation of many of the foregoing stars has undergone a change in recent years, with the availability of photoelectric PHOTOMETERS and their associated V Vandenberg Air Force Base 426 \u0001 Veil Nebula The delicate wisps of the Veil Nebula in Cygnus are the remnant of a supernova explosion that occurred at least 30,000 years ago.

Similarly, the use of CCD equipment has enabled amateurs to reach fainter magnitudes than were possible with purely visual methods. All such observations have been welcomed by the professionals because there are so many variable stars to be observed: in 1786 there were only 12; by 1866 this had grown to 119; by 1907 the number had increased to 1425; the advent of photographic methods of discovery saw numbers grow rapidly thereafter until by 1941 there w ere 8445 known variable stars. Since then the number has continued to increase rapidly so that today there are tens of thousands of these stars. To observe variable stars, both professionals and amateurs need detailed maps of small areas of the sky in which the variable is situated and on which both the va r iable and the surrounding stars are clearly identified, preferably with a sequence of comparison stars of constant brightness. This is often impossible for the simple reason that the magnitudes of the surrounding stars have not been accurately determined. This problem may be overcome in several ways, one of which is to select what appear to be suitable comparison stars from photographic plates and to assign letters to them as symbols. This then enables visual observations to be made pending the determination of accurate magnitudes later. For making a visual estimate of a variable star, the observer compares it with two stars of known, unchanging brightness. There are three principal methods – the ARGELANDER STEP METHOD , the FRACTIONAL METHOD and the POGSON STEP METHOD . The main sources of the necessary charts are the Va r iable Star Sections of the BAA and RASNZ, and the AAVSO. The importance of variable stars is shown by the fact that about one-third of the astronomical literature is concerned with them in some way. variation Te rm with several meanings in different contexts. Lunar variation is the second-largest periodic PERTURBATION of the Moon’s longitude, caused by the Sun, displacing it from its mean position by \u0001 39 \u0002 29 \u0003 .9 with a period of 14.765 days (half of the synodic month). The perturbation, discovered by Tycho Brahe at around 1580, was the first major advance in the knowledge of the Moon’s orbit since the discovery of the evection by Ptolemy in about AD 140. The perturbation varies as the sine of twice the longitude difference of the Sun and Moon, and hence it is zero at new and full moons. Thus it does not affect the times of occurrence of eclipses, which allowed it to escape detection for 14 centuries. Annual variation is the annual rate of change of the coordinates of a star due to the combined effects of PRECESSION and PROPER MOTION . Secular variation is the rate of change per century of the annual precessional change in a star’s coordinates. Magnetic variation is the angle between the directions of magnetic north and true north at any particular location on the Earth’s surface; its v alue changes with time. V aruna Large TRANS - NEPTUNIAN OBJECT catalogued as asteroid number 20000. It was discovered late in the year 2000, although images of it on photographic plates dating back to 1955 have been identified. Varuna takes 285 years to orbit the Sun, in a low-eccentricity orbit with perihelion at 40.9 AU and aphelion at 45.7 AU. Varuna is particularly notable because its absolute magnitude (H=3.7) indicates that it may be among the largest known asteroids. If its albedo is as low as 0.05, then its equivalent diameter would be about 1100 km (680 mi), which is larger than CERES . If its albedo is 0.25, however, its diameter would be only 500 km (300 mi).

Bannan Astrophysics Facility located at the MOUNT GRAHAM INTERNATIONAL OBSERVATORY . It is operated by the Va tican Observatory Research Group, and observing time is shared with the UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF ASTRONOMY . The telescope has an unusually deep primary mirror whose focal length is equal to its diameter. It was made at the University of Arizona Mirror Laboratory to test new spin-casting and optical polishing techniques that have since been used for mirrors up to 8.4 m (330 in.) in diameter (in the LARGE BINOCULAR TELESCOPE ). The VATT saw first light in 1993. V ega The star \u0004 Lyrae, the fifth-brightest in the sky, visual mag. 0.03 (although HIPPARCOS found it to be DELTA SCUTI STAR – a variable with fluctuations of a few hundredths of a magnitude).

Seven months later, on their wa y to Halley’s Comet, they released landers on to the surface and two balloons into the atmosphere of VENUS . The landers sent back data for just under an hour, while the balloons transmitted for 46.5 hours as they drifted around the planet. Their closest approaches to the comet took place on 1986 March 6 and 9 respectively. Although the Vegas were used as pathfinders for the GIOTTO spacecraft, they also obtained valuable images of the comet’s nucleus and other data on its coma. The flyby distances were 8890 km (5520 mi) and 8030 km (4990 mi) on the sunward side of the nucleus. The probes carried identical payloads of two cameras, infrared spectrometers, gas and dust mass spectrometers, dust impact detectors and plasma analysers. The name Vega w as derived from Venera and Galley (the Russian pronunciation of Halley).

Venera 4 was the first spacecraft to send back data during descent through the Venusian atmosphere. The first successful landing on Venus was accomplished by Venera 7 in 1970. Venera 9, the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Venus, also made history by deploying a lander that returned the first picture from the rocky surface. Pictures were also returned from landers on Veneras 10, 13 and 14. The landers collected atmospheric data during descent and, on later missions, used a gamma-ray detector and instruments to detect electrical (lightning) discharges. Veneras 15 and 16, the last in the series, were orbiters equipped with radar to map the surface between 30ºN and the north pole at a resolution of 1–2 km (0.6–1.2 mi). Venus Second planet in the Solar System from the Sun and, apart from the Sun and the Moon, the brightest object in the sky. Venus is one of the TERRESTRIAL PLANETS , similar in nature to the Earth but slightly smaller. Like the Earth it has a substantial atmosphere. Since its orbit lies inside that of the Earth, Venus never strays farther from the Sun than 47º. Accordingly, it can only be observed either in the east as a morning object or in the west as an evening star. As a result, like the Moon, it goes through a sequence of phases and at its brightest is actually a thin crescent close to inferior conjunction. Galileo in the 17th century helped to affirm Copernicus’ heliocentric theory through his discovery of the phases of Venus. All that can be seen optically on Venus is the upper deck of a uniform, unbroken layer of yellowish cloud, the top of which may be at an altitude of about 100 km (62 mi) above the planet’s surface. The cloud reflects 76% of the incident sunlight, and Venus has the highest known planetary albedo (0.76). This contrasts with the Earth, which, on average, has only 50% cloud cover and an albedo of about 0.37. Venus’ atmosphere is huge, more than 90 times more massive than that of the Earth and is composed primarily of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Traces of hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, carbon monoxide, nitrogen, water vapour, hydrogen sulphide, carbonyl sulphide, sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), argon, krypton and xenon have also been detected. Venus’ atmosphere extends to an altitude of 250 km (155 mi) above the surface, but it possesses only a thermosphere and troposphere in its layered structure. On the day side of Venus, there is a terrestrial-type thermosphere with temperatures increasing from about 180 K at 100 km (62 mi) to about 300 K in the exosphere. The thermosphere does not exist on the night side of the planet, where the temperature falls from about 180 K at 100 km (62 mi) to 100 K at 150 km (93 mi). The transition from day-side to night-side temperatures across the terminator is very abrupt. The atmosphere is extremely variable in the neighbourhood of the cloud tops in the altitude range of 75–100 km (47–62 mi); diurnal fluctuations of as much as 25 K have been observed at the 95 km (59 mi) level. Below these variable haze layers are the ubiquitous clouds, which occupy a substantial portion of the V Vela 428 \u0001 Vela Supernova Remnant Tendrils of material were ejected into interstellar space by the explosion of a supernova in the southern constellation Vela about a thousand years ago.

There are three distinct cloud layers in the region of 45–60 km (28–37 mi), with differing particle sizes and concentrations. Sulphuric acid droplets make up the main composition of the clouds of Venus. The droplets are formed from the reaction between H 2 O and SO 2 high in the atmosphere, aided by ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. The sulphuric acid clouds form a layer of va r ying concentration extending from 40–75 km (25–47 mi), with rain occurring in the lower layers. The temperature increases steadily from the cloud tops at about 300 K to the surface at 750 K, where there is virtually no wind. Beneath the clouds and on the surface of Venus, the temperatures are the same everywhere. About 90% of the volume of the entire at mosphere lies between the surface and an altitude of 28 km (17 mi). At this level the atmosphere resembles a massive ocean, dense and sluggish in its response to the ve ry w eak solar heating. Only 2% of the incident sunlight actually reaches the surface of the planet. The surface pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than that on Earth and the surface temperature is the highest known in the Solar System. This crushing CO 2 environment at the surface of Venus is the result of a runaway GREENHOUSE EFFECT . The basic make-up of the Earth and Venus is ve ry similar, but there is now as much CO 2 in the a tmosphere of Venus as we find in the limestone rocks of the Earth. Because Venus is nearer to the Sun, it receives twice the sunlight than is incident on the Earth, and thus its surface has rapidly heated up by the greenhouse mechanism to its current state. This effect cannot be achieved by the CO 2 alone. The small traces of H 2 O and SO 2 are also essential for the efficient greenhouse effect. V enus’ surface temperature will not increase further since the atmosphere and surface are in chemical equilibrium. The weather systems of Venus, at the level of the cloud tops, are strange. Although the planet itself is rotating very slowly, the equatorial clouds have a rotation period of four days, indicating wind speeds of 100 m/s (330 ft/s). Consequently, the cloud tops are moving in a retrograde direction 60 times faster than the surface of the planet. Almost all the solar energy is absorbed in the cloud tops, and this provides the main driving mechanism for the super-rotation of the atmosphere. The cloud tops of Titan and the upper atmosphere of the Earth are the only other regions known to super-rotate. The surface of Venus is surprisingly varied, which may suggest that the initial geological developments took place before the massive atmosphere evolved into its current state. Images from the Soviet VENERA landers show a stony desert landscape, with outcrops and patches of dark material suggesting some chemical erosion. The subsequent radioactive analyses of Venus’ soil suggest the composition is similar to BASALT , but with an unusually high concentration of potassium. Some of the basaltic materials are similar to those found on the terrestrial seabed. About 70% of the surface is covered by huge rolling plains, 20% by depressional regions and the remaining 10% by highlands, which are concentrated in two main areas. A more detailed understanding of the nature and global distribution of the planet’s landforms has resulted from studies of the improved-resolution MAGELLAN imagery. Features disclosed by this mission include aeolian dunes, wind- streaks, channels, lava flow lobes, impact craters and outflow material associated with impact ejecta. Each of the major highlands or continent-like units (Terra) is separated from the others by low lying plains or basins (Planitia). The most extensive is Atalanta Planitia in the northern hemisphere. Atalanta Planitia is about 1.4 km (0.9 mi) below the mean planetary radius, and is about the size of the Gulf of Mexico.

The highland areas include mountains (Mons or Montes), plateaux or high plains (Planum) and volcanic areas important in the evolution of the planet and its a tmosphere. The major highlands are ISHTAR TERRA , in high northern latitudes, and APHRODITE TERRA , which spans the equator. A third, the most recently discovered, is Lada Terra, revealed by Magellan, which is located largely south of latitude 50ºS. Lada Terra is bordered on the north by lowland plains, and is joined to ALPHA REGIO , some 3500 km (2200 mi) to the north, by a complex of deep rifts. BETA REGIO , another highland area, contains two large shield volcanoes, Rhea Mons and Theia Mons. These tower some 4 km (2.5 mi) above the surface on a faultline that extends north–south. They are similar to the Hawaiian volcanoes and may well be active. Indeed, there has been a noticeable reduction in the measured amount of atmospheric SO 2 during the past 10 y ears, which could be explained by past volcanic eruptions and the associated atmospheric adjustment. Electrical activity beneath the clouds in the form of lightning has been inferred from measurements made during the descent of Venera 11 and 12. Again this could be caused by volcanic activity. V enus does not have a magnetic field in spite of possessing a large nickel–iron core. This is due to the very slow rotation of the planet, which is unable to generate a field by dynamo action. However, a very weak magnetic field is induced in the planet’s ionosphere through the interaction of the SOLAR WIND ; the resulting BOW SHOCK region acts as a buffer between the interplanetary medium and the atmosphere of Venus.

The VLA is operated by the NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY , a facility of the National Science Foundation. The telescope consists of 27 antennae arranged in a huge ‘Y’ shape with a maximum extent of 36 km (22 mi). Each antenna has an aperture of 25 m (82 ft), weighs 230 tonnes and can be moved along a track to adjust the spacing of the array. The signals are combined electronically, and four different configurations are used – from compact to far-flung. At its highest resolution (with the antennae at their maximum spacing), the VLA has the same resolution as a single dish 36 km (22 mi) across. This corresponds to 0 \u0001 .04 at the maximum operating frequency of 43 GHz. The instrument has the sensitivity of a single telescope 130 m (427 ft) in diameter.

The names are those of the Sun, the Moon, the Southern Cross, and Venus, respectively, in the local Maopuche language. They can be operated either independently or together; in combination they have an effective aperture of 16.4 m (54 ft). When operated in a mode called VLTI, they are used with three 1.8-m (72-in) outrigger telescopes to carry out optical INTERFEROMETRY . The telescopes of the VLT have mirrors made of a single piece of a glass–ceramic material as opposed to the segmented mirrors at the W . M . KECK OBSERVATORY . Unique among the new instruments (not least because it was built in a non-ESO nation) is the OzPoz robotic spectrograph feed supplied by the ANGLO - A USTRALIAN OBSERVATORY in 2002.

Their signals are recorded separately on tape and later combined at the Operations Centre in Socorro, New Mexico. Each antenna is 25 m (82 ft) in diameter, and the maximum separation of the array is 8600 km (5400 mi), giving it an angular resolution of 0 \u0001 .001. Rather than supplanting the VERY LARGE ARRAY , it is complementary to it, providing astronomers with a finer scale of resolution. Construction of the VLBA began in 1986, and the first observation with the complete array was made in 1993. It is operated by the NATIONAL RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY with funding from the National Science Foundation. very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) Combining of RADIO TELESCOPES separated by thousands of kilometres to act as a RADIO INTERFEROMETER in order to observe the same astronomical object with a resolving power of 0 \u0001 .0002. The radio telescopes for VLBI are located around the world, many in the United States, Europe and Australia, plus several in other countries. Several radio telescopes in Europe can also combine together to form the European VLBI Network (EVN). VLBI can study structure in quasar jets, and it showed the superluminal motions in the jet of the quasar 3C 273 and the active galaxy M87. Knowledge and understanding of radio sources has been revolutionized by VLBI. Intercontinental VLBI has also used measurements of a known quasar to track the positions of the telescopes, monitoring the steady drift of the continents and the wandering of the poles.

Its size, albedo and location, near the inner edge of the main belt, mean that Vesta is the brightest of all such asteroids and may just attain naked-eye visibility. Images obtained with the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE show Vesta to be roughly spherical, with a very large depression around its southern pole, which may be a vast impact crater. Like PALLAS , Vesta has a high average density ( c .3.9 g/cm 3 ), which may be due to a metallic interior similar to nickel–iron meteorites, despite its surface reflectivity indicating a stony composition. Its mass is about 3.0 \u0002 10 20 kg (0.41% the mass of the Moon). Several smaller asteroids have similar orbits to Vesta ( see HIRAYAMA FAMILY ) and this group, formed from the fragmentation of an earlier body, is thought to be the source of the METEORITES known as eucrites, howardites and diogenites. video astronomy Use of video cameras for astronomical imaging. The large image scales produced by a CCD offer dramatic detailed views of the Sun, Moon, planets and brighter planetary satellites. Unlike the long integration times possible with cooled CCD imagers, conventional video cameras are limited to short exposure times comprised of two consecutive fields combined to produce a stream of continuous pictures at 25 or 30 frames per second. This fast frame ability makes video an excellent tool for accurately timing occultation events. The fast exposure time of continuous video also provides an effective way to capture an unpredictable moment of steady seeing. A standard 3-hour videotape can capture over 270,000 individual images, and frame-by-frame playback makes for easy identification of the best images recorded, which can be selected and combined by IMAGE PROCESSING . Throughout the 1990s, developments in highly light sensitive CCD image sensors have paved the way for con- venient astronomical imaging with video cameras. In 1998 a video camera was used on the historic 60-inch (1.5-m) telescope at Mount Wilson by a Boston University team imaging notoriously difficult Mercury. They obtained unprecedented ground-based images of a hemisphere not previously imaged during the Mariner 10 flyby. Video cameras are also widely used to record fireball and meteor showers. In 1999 members of the INTERNA - TIONAL OCCULTATION TIMING ASSOCIATION captured video evidence of meteoric impact events on the Moon during the November Leonid meteor shower. To study the radiant of an extremely faint meteor shower, a wide- angle lens is coupled to the input window of an image intensifier, and a video camera then records the image at the output window of the intensifier. Image intensifiers can be used for real-time viewing and recording of many deep-sky objects. To produce useful images, detail is important and the number of TV lines a camera produces governs the reso- lution of the video image. Many amateurs use modified low-light security cameras that output between 400 and 600 lines. The output signal can be recorded directly to videotape or a computer using a video capture interface. Analogue S-VHS video machines are capable of record- ing up to 400 lines, while digital recorders and computer capture devices are capable of more. To preserve spatial resolution sacrificed in most single-chip colour cameras and maintain optimal signal-to-noise ratios, monochrome cameras produce the best results when used for tri-colour imaging of planets. As with conventional cooled CCD cameras, video images transferred to computer can be further processed using image-processing software. Since a video camera is an uncooled integrating device, individual frames suffer from some amount of thermal dark noise generated by the camera’s electronics. Stacking or layering several selected individual images can produce a smoother, more aestheti- cally pleasing final picture with improved depth of detail. vignetting Partial shadowing of an optical image caused by obstructions within the light beam or by optical components too small to pass all the beam. The effect of vignetting is to make some parts of the image dimmer than they should be, but it is not always detected by the user. It is often present in cheap binoculars and can be detected by looking at the bright spot visible in the eyepiece when viewed from a distance. This spot should be circular and evenly illuminated. If it is not, then some vignetting, usually caused by the prisms, is present. The effect is sometimes present when taking photographs through a telescope. It may not be noticed on a photograph of the sky but a terrestrial shot will often be brighter in the middle and darker at the corners.

Viking 1 was launched by a Titan-Centaur booster on 1975 September 9, and injected into Mars orbit on 1976 June 19. The first month of orbiter operations consisted of locating and verifying a safe landing site for the lander spacecraft. The lander spacecraft separated from the orbiter and landed on the surface on 1976 July 20. Viking 2 was launched on 1975 August 20, injected into Mars orbit on 1976 August 7, and its lander spacecraft touched down on 1976 September 3. Because Mars is the most hospitable of the planets, and because of the long history of debate regarding the possibility of life on Mars ( see LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE ; CANALS , MARTIAN ), the landers carried experiments to search for life. All the experiments operated successfully, and no indications of life were found at either landing site (though some have criticized the design of the experiments, claiming the outcome was ambiguous), but this does not preclude life at other locations. Meteorological instruments on the landers regularly reported the weather and monitored surface changes and seasonal effects. Each orbiter carried two vidicon cameras and each lander carried two facsimile cameras. The orbiters mapped the entire surface of Mars at 150–300 m (500–1000 ft) resolution and selected areas at resolutions down to 8 m (26 ft). In all, they returned more than 55,000 images, including high-resolution pictures of the satellites Phobos and Deimos.

The centre of the cluster is about 65 million l.y. away, and is marked by the g iant elliptical galaxy M87, also known as the radio source Virgo A, which is ejecting a strong jet of gas. In all there are 16 Messier objects in the cluster; the total number of galaxies in the cluster is about 3000. virial theorem Theorem concerning the conservation of energy equations that relates the kinetic energy of gas or stars to the gravitational potential energy: E = P G + KE where E is the total energy, P G is the gravitational potential energy, and KE is the kinetic energy or energy of motion.

V isible–Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy See VISTA visible spectrum Wa v elength band that is visible to the human eye. The visible spectrum, sometimes called the ‘optical spectrum’, extends approximately from 400 to 700 nm. It is subdivided (from long to short wave) by the major visual colours red, orange, yellow, green, indigo and violet. It is flanked by the ‘near-ultraviolet’ and the ‘near-infrared’. The visible spectrum was the first to be explored, and it contains the FRAUNHOFER LINES as well as my r iad other ABSORPTION LINES and EMISSION LINES .

Originally, the telescope was planned to have wide-field imagers in both the visible and infrared wavebands, but the visible-light function will now be carried out by ESO’s VST ( see P ARANAL OBSERVATORY ), so VISTA will be an infrared-only telescope. visual binary Gravitationally bound BINARY STAR system in which both components can be resolved, sometimes without a telescope. The brighter star is termed the primary, the fainter is termed the companion. When the separation is too large for orbital motion to be observed, they are called common proper motion stars. If orbital motion can be observed, the orbit of the companion with respect to the primary can be determined. If the distance to the pair is known, the total mass of the binary can be determined from Kepler’s third law ( see KEPLER ’ SLAWS ). The individual masses of the components can be determined if the absolute orbit of each star can be measured. visual magnitude Apparent brightness of an astronomical body as seen by the eye, whose maximum sensitivity is at a wavelength of 550 nm. Such magnitudes are now determined photographically or photoelectrically, using appropriate filters, and are called PHOTOVISUAL MAGNITUDES .

Since initial chemical composition varies relatively slightly between stars, it is thus principally a star’s initial mass that determines its basic structure and evolution. voids Large areas in the Universe where there are apparently few, if any, galaxies. This is in contrast to areas where large clusters of galaxies reside. See also LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE V olans See feature article volatile Element or compound that evaporates at a relatively low temperature. All of the noble gases and other constituents of planetary atmospheres, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, ammonia and carbon dioxide, are v olatiles. The most significant volatile is water. Sulphur and its compounds are also classed as volatiles. Materials with higher temperatures of evaporation, such as most metals and silicates, are called refractory. volcanism Eruption of molten material at the surface of a planetary body. MAGMA is usually less dense than the surrounding solid rock, and it tends to rise through any cracks or zones of weakness. Planetary crusts consist of a variety of minerals, so heating these materials does not necessarily lead to a unique melting temperature. Some minerals may melt while others, still solid, may be carried along in a fluidized medium. V OLATILES , including water, carbon dioxide and sulphur compounds, dissolve in molten silicates at high pressures; they are released at lower pressure near the surface. The mixture’s volatile component, viscosity and yield strength will vary between planets and between different rock types on a given planet; thus there are different types of eruption, the extremes being ‘quiescent’ and ‘violent’. On Earth, large volumes of basaltic lava are erupted relatively quiescently from calderas (as in Hawaii), producing gently sloping shield v olcanoes, and from fissures (such as in Iceland), producing lava plains. Steeper cones are produced by explosive pyroclastic eruptions of silica-rich material in which the gas pressure shatters the lava and rock into fountains of fragments. Earth displays a wide variety of volcanic landforms. The volcanic materials reach the surface through conduits and fissures associated with the active margins of tectonic plates and mid-oceanic ridges. Other planets have a variety of volcanic landforms. Mercury appears to show some volcanic features. On the Moon, lavas erupted from fractures, filling the large impact basins (maria) with basaltic magma; some small volcanic domes and lava tubes are also present. Venus appears to have been resurfaced by lava flows of great extent. Mars has several extinct shield volcanoes; OLYMPUS MONS , with a height of 24 km (15 mi) and a diameter greater than 700 km (430 mi), is the largest volcanic edifice known. Apart from Earth, only IO is known to have active volcanoes. Subject to TIDAL HEATING produced by Jupiter’s gr a vitational pull, Io has numerous volcanoes in nearly constant state of eruption. The products of these eruptions, which are in both pyroclastic and flow form, are unique in their high sulphur content. In the early Solar System, impacts during A CCRETION produced heat; much of the Moon was probably melted in this manner. Larger planets were melted by conversion of gr a vitational energy into heat during DIFFERENTIATION . Heating is also produced by natural RADIOACTIVITY in planetary interiors.

The launch weight of the vehicle and propulsion rocket was in each case 2016 kg, of which the Vo y ager itself accounted for 792 kg. Ten instruments w ere carried on each spacecraft. Vo y ager 2 was the first to be launched from Cape Canaveral, on 1977 August 20. Voyager 1 followed on September 5. However, Voyager 1 was travelling on a faster, shorter trajectory and overtook its twin during the crossing of the ASTEROID BELT . On 1979 March 5 Vo y ager 1 passed Jupiter at a distance of 350,000 km (217,500 mi) and sent back the best images ever obtained of the planet and its moons. Its discoveries included v olcanic eruptions on IO , linear features on EUROPA and the existence of a dark, dusty ring. Vo y ager 1 then went on to a rendezvous with SATURN on 1980 November 12, at a minimum distance of 124,200 km (77,000 mi). Once again, it sent back high- resolution images of the planet and the satellites TITAN , RHEA , DIONE and MIMAS . The complex nature of the rings w as fully revealed, and new data were obtained about the magnetic field, radiation belts and other phenomena. Vo y ager 1’s encounter with Titan bent the spacecraft’s path northward, so that it continued on an orbit out of the ECLIPTIC plane at an angle of 35º. Had Titan not been satisfactorily imaged, then Voyager 2 would have been targeted to carry out a survey, so losing the opportunity to rendezvous with either of the outer giant planets. Vo y ager 2 passed Jupiter on 1979 July 9 at a distance of 645,000 km (400,000 mi). The results fully complemented those of its predecessor, and showed marked changes in the Jovian atmosphere and the v olcanic activity on Io. A small satellite, now known as ADRASTEA , was found close to the rings. Voyager 2 then w ent on to Saturn, passing the planet on 1981 August 25 at a distance of 101,300 km (63,000 mi). Quite detailed images of the satellites IAPETUS , HYPERION , TETHYS and ENCELADUS w ere obtained. However, after closest approach to Saturn, the scan platform that carried the camera apparently jammed, so some vital information w as lost. The problem solved itself, but subsequently the platform was manoeuvred only at reduced rate. After the gravity assist at Saturn, Voyager 2 was directed towards URANUS . The closest approach took place on 1986 January 24, at a distance of 107,000 km (67,000 mi). This part of the mission was particularly important, because comparatively little had been known about Uranus. Many discoveries were made, including ten new moons (including a number of small ‘shepherd’ satellites near the rings), the weird terrain of MIRANDA and the planet’s remarkable, tilted magnetic field. Vo y ager 2’s ‘Grand Tour’ was completed with the flyby of NEPTUNE and its large moon TRITON on 1989 August 24. As the spacecraft passed within 4900 km (3000 mi) of Neptune’s cloud tops, Voyager 2 obtained remarkable images of giant storm systems on the planet. It also found six new moons and evidence of geyser activity on Triton’s icy surface.

V ulcan Planet once thought to circle the Sun inside the orbit of Mercury. It was invoked by Urbain LE VERRIER in 1859 to explain the faster than predicted advance of the heliocentric longitude of the perihelion of Mercury. To Le Verrier this implied either the existence of a body roughly the size of Mercury but at half its distance from the Sun, or a similarly placed ring of smaller bodies. F ollowing his announcement in September of that year, Le Verrier had news from a French amateur astronomer, Edmond Lescarbault of Orgres, who reported that in March he had seen an unidentified dark object transit a segment of the Sun. Le Verrier hurried to Orgres and satisfied himself the claim was authentic. He named the object Vulcan and calculated its orbit. More sightings we re reported but all turned out to be cases of mistaken identity. Interest revived in 1878, following the observation of mysterious objects near the Sun at the total eclipse of July 29. But the claim degenerated into confusion and controversy, and it was ultimately discarded. There were other false alarms in 1882 and 1900, but in 1915 after a radical reappraisal, which altered our understanding of Newtonian gravitational principles, Albert EINSTEIN neatly resolved the problem with his general theory of relativity. While Le Verrier’s Vulcan has slipped from currency, questions remain. For instance theoreticians have revived the idea of an inner ring of asteroids, or ‘Vulcanoids’, and have defined a number of possible orbits. The discovery by SOHO of numerous small comets close to the Sun gives credence to the idea. With a better appreciation of Earth-crossing asteroids and interplanetary objects in general, it is now easier to understand why these 19th-century astronomers believed they had observed Vulcan.

Machine-tool company based in Cleveland, Ohio, that made several large telescopes for major observatories in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Worcester Reed Warner (1846–1929) was a machinist from Massachusetts who had an interest in astronomy; in 1880 he opened a factory in Chicago with Ambrose Swasey (1846–1937), a mechanical engineer from New Hampshire. After a year, they relocated their operations to Cleveland, where there were more skilled machinists, and the business prospered. Wa r ner & Swasey’s first telescope was a 9 \u0001 \u0002 -inch (240-mm) refractor sold to Beloit College, Wisconsin, with a lens by ALVAN CLARK & SONS . Buoyed by this success, the firm began making larger German equatorial mountings. Large, sturdy mountings of this type were necessary to support the large refracting telescopes favoured by major observatories in the late 19th century. Warner & Swasey were the first telescope-makers to approach telescope design as a total engineering problem, and their highly accurate equatorial drives gained them renown. One of their innovations was to replace the tangle of ropes and chains used to control the long tube assemblies with a more elegant and efficient system of rods and gear trains controlled from the eyepiece end of the telescope. By 1886 Warner & Swasey had completed LICK OBSERVATORY ’ S 36-inch (0.9-m) refracting telescope which, with another Clark lens, was then the world’s largest. They topped this achievement with the 40-inch (1-m) refractor installed at YERKES OBSERVATORY (1893). From 1885 to 1915 John BRASHEAR supplied most of the lenses for the firm’s telescopes.

Webb Society International society of amateur and professional astronomers who specialize in observing double stars and deep-sky objects (DSOs), founded in 1967 and named in honour of the 19th-century amateur observer the Reverend T.W. WEBB . The Webb Society publishes a quarterly journal, Deep Sky Observer , and specialist observing guides for various categories of DSO. Webb, Thomas William (1807–85) English clergyman whose Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes (1859) did much to popularize amateur astronomy in Britain. His book was based on 25 years of observing planets and variable and binary stars with a 3.7-inch refractor, though after 1864 he began to popularize the new silver- on-glass reflecting telescopes of George Henry With (1827–1904). Webb was pre-eminently an observer, not concerned with making scientific discoveries, just wishing to enjoy the beauty of the night sky. He inspired many to do likewise, and is therefore one of the founders of modern amateur astronomy. wedge Adjustable, angled platform placed under a FORK MOUNTING to adjust it to the local latitude.

The wedge is required to create a true EQUATORIAL MOUNTING and eliminate FIELD ROTATION . Weizsäcker, Carl Friedrich von (1912– ) German theoretical physicist and astrophysicist known for his theories of stellar energy generation and the formation of the Solar System. In 1938 he proposed, independently of Hans BETHE , that stars generate energy in their extremely hot cores via the successive fusion of nuclei of hydrogen, helium and carbon. Weizsäcker calculated how much energy each reaction would produce. In 1944 he proposed a theory of the formation of the Solar System, a variant of Pierre-Simon de LAPLACE ’s NEBULAR HYPOTHESIS . In Weizsäcker’s COSMOGONY , vortices develop in a disk of condensing gas and dust surrounding the primordial Sun, triggering the formation of bodies by accretion.

Whipple, Fred Lawrence (1906– ) American planetary scientist who devised the ‘dirty snowball’ picture of cometary structure. He spent most of his scientific life at Harvard, where he directed the SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY (1955–73). In the 1930s, his photographic studies of meteor paths provided evidence that meteor showers occur when swarms of debris left behind by comets intersect the Earth’s orbit. Whipple’s comet model (1949) described them as large aggregates of ices and silicate debris; when the comet nears the Sun and is heated, sublimating ices are ejected in jets along with silicates, generating the comet’s dust tail. He showed that these jets, confirmed by 1986 spacecraft studies of Comet HALLEY , can affect the comet’s orbital motions. The FRED L . WHIPPLE OBSERVATORY is named in his honour.

Discovered by Charles MESSIER in 1773, the Whirlpool Galaxy takes its name from drawings and descriptions made in 1845 by Lord Rosse, who saw its prominent spiral arms through his 72-inch (1.8-m) reflector. M51 appears to be interacting with a smaller companion galaxy, NGC 5195. It is the most prominent member of a small group that lies 37 million l.y. away. whistler Effect that occurs when a plasma disturbance, caused by a lightning stroke, travels out along lines of magnetic force of the Earth’s magnetic field and is reflected back to its point of origin. The disturbance may be picked up electromagnetically and when converted to sound gives the characteristic drawn-out descending pitch of the whistler. This is a dispersion effect caused by the greater velocity of the higher-frequency components of the disturbance. The reflections from ionized meteor trails ( see RADAR ASTRONOMY ) can be observed as a ‘whistler’ in a receiver tuned to a distant transmitting station. Here the whistler is an interference beat between the ground wave from the transmitter and the wave reflected from the ionized meteor trail. white dwarf Evolved STAR with mass similar to the Sun but with a radius only about as large as that of the Earth. White dwarfs are composed of DEGENERATE MATTER and are supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The density of the matter from which they are made is enormously greater than that of any terrestrial material: one cubic centimetre of white dwarf matter weighs approximately one tonne. The first white dwarf to be discovered was the companion of Sirius, now called SIRIUS B . In 1844 Friedrich BESSEL discovered irregularities in the motion of Sirius, and concluded that it must have a companion, the pair forming a BINARY SYSTEM with a period of about 50 years. In order for its gravity to swing Sirius around in its orbit, it was clear that the companion must have a comparable mass (quantitative analyses using Kepler’s third law for the binary orbit giving a mass between 75% and 95% of the Sun’s mass), and yet it must be very faint to have remained undetected by direct observation. In 1862 ALVAN CLARK and his son Alvan Graham Clark discovered a very faint star close to Sirius, which was subsequently identified as the elusive companion. As the distance to the system was known, this allowed the companion’s luminosity to be estimated as only about 1/360 of that of the Sun. In 1914 W.S. ADAMS made the surprising discovery that Sirius B had the spectrum of a ‘white’ star, with a surface temperature about two and a half to three times that of the Sun. The total radiation from the surface of a hot body rises as the fourth power of its temperature, so that each square centimetre of Sirius B’s surface should radiate between thirty and eighty times as much as the Sun. The only way to reconcile this with the very low total luminosity inferred above was to conclude that the radius of Sirius B was far smaller than that of any star known at the time. The result remained uncertain until in 1925 Adams succeeded in detecting the gravitational redshifts of several absorption lines in the spectrum of Sirius B. This general relativistic effect depends on the ratio of the star’s mass to its radius. As the mass was already known from the properties of the orbit, Adams was able to find the radius of the star in an independent wa y, giving an estimate consistent with his earlier result. It was very quickly realized that their enormous matter densities make white dwarfs fundamentally Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope 436 W \u0001 Whirlpool Galaxy The magnificent Whirlpool Galaxy (M51, NGC 5194) takes its name from its pronounced spiral structure.

In a star like the Sun, it is the thermal pressure of the gas and radiation of the star that prevents it simply collapsing under its own w eight. As early as 1926, the British astronomer Ralph Howard Fowler (1889–1944) showed that this cannot be the case for white dwarfs. Instead, the pressure required to hold up these stars against their own gravity is provided by a fundamental quantum-mechanical effect which had been discovered only months before by US physicist Enrico Fermi (1901–54) and British physicist Paul Dirac (1902–84). As in most stars, the matter inside a white dwarf is almost completely ionized, that is, the electrons have all been ripped off their parent atoms (here because of the frequent collisions between atoms) leaving the matter as a mixture of free electrons and nuclei. What Fermi and Dirac had discovered is that there is a fundamental limit to how close together two electrons can be pushed. Electrons resist being in the same place with the same speeds: push them closer together and they will react by moving faster. This motion amounts to a pressure, called degeneracy pressure: it differs from ordinary thermal pressure in depending only on the density of the constituent particles, rather than on the product of the density and the gas temperature. The larger the mass of a star supported by degeneracy pressure, the faster the electrons inside it must move, until ultimately, for stars of masses only slightly greater than that of the Sun, they are moving with speeds close to that of light. The theory of RELATIVITY forbids motions faster than light, so that relativistic corrections must be made to the degeneracy pressure for such stars. The pressure is then found to increase rather less rapidly with the density. In 1931 Subrahmanyan CHANDRASEKHAR computed the structure of a white dwarf with these relativistic effects included. He made the discovery that a white dwarf cannot have a mass more than about 1.4 times the Sun’s mass ( see CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT ). For larger masses, gr a vity would always overwhelm the pressure forces and the star would collapse under its own weight. Stars with initial masses ranging from about 0.08 to about 8 solar masses (over 95% of the stars of our Galaxy) will eventually end up as white dwarfs. All stars lose energy into space by radiation. In response to this constant drain of energy, the central parts of the star gently sink closer together during huge expanses of time, becoming denser and more tightly bound by their mutual gravitational attraction. If the star is supported in the normal way by thermal pressure, it has to become hotter in order to supply the increased pressure demanded by the stronger gravity. Thus in response to the loss of energy by radiation from its surface, the star has actually had to become hotter. This means that radiation losses from its surface will continue, driving the evolution to more tightly bound and hotter configurations ever onwards: the star cannot simply cool down and stop evolving. In the white dwarf state, however, we have seen that the supporting degeneracy pressure is independent of the temperature of the stellar material: the star can now radiate all its thermal energy into space without any consequences for its internal structure, and the evolution of the star ends with it quietly cooling down to a cold, dark, inert configuration known as a BLACK DWARF . In practice the star will by then consist entirely of helium and heavier elements, its original hydrogen having been transmuted in the course of its earlier evolution. The existence of the Chandrasekhar limiting mass means that this endpoint is not available to all stars, but only to those whose mass is below the limit when they reach the white dwarf state. It is now known that more massive stars must end their evolution either as NEUTRON STARS or BLACK HOLES . Neutron stars are also supported by degeneracy pressure, but of neutrons rather than electrons; for them, too, there is a maximum mass, although its precise value is less certain than for white dwarfs. Many white dwarfs are now known, and their observed properties are in good accord with theoretical predictions. Much interest now centres on white dwarfs in binary systems, particularly those that are close enough for gas to be pulled off the companion star on to the white dwarf. Such systems are called CATACLYSMIC V ARIABLES and include NOVAE and DW ARF NOVAE . Evidence also suggests that a very old, faint population of white dwarfs exists in the halo of our Galaxy. white hole Inverse evaporating BLACK HOLE . Although nothing can escape a black hole’s gravity, a black hole actually has a temperature and particles can tunnel out of it. The temperature and emission of particles and energy by a black hole depend on the inverse of the temperature of the black hole; low-mass black holes emit particles at a higher rate than high-mass black holes. A white hole is the final moments of evaporation of a black hole when information and matter emerge from the hole in an unpredictable fashion.

He was the first (1931) to correctly ascribe absorption lines in the spectra of Jupiter and Saturn to methane and ammonia in their atmospheres. In Wildt’s models of the gas giants, a small rocky core was surrounded by ice and shrouded in a deep, hydrogen-rich atmosphere. In 1939 he explained the ‘missing opacity’ of the solar atmosphere by showing that hydrogen ions slow the radiative flow of energy from the interior, making the outer layers more transparent.

Wilson, Alexander (1714–86) Scottish scientist who made pioneering solar observations. Over many years, he carefully observed sunspots and their shapes. In 1769 he noticed the changed appearance in a spot’s penumbra when a spot is near the limb, now known as the WILSON EFFECT , which he attributed to the fact that sunspots are depressions in the solar surface. Wilson published his cosmological theories in Thoughts on General Gravitation (1770), proposing that the entire Universe rotates about a discrete central point.

The mirror is composed of 36 hexagonal segments, each 1.8 m (72 in.) wide and 75 mm (3 in.) thick, under computer control to maintain a continuous reflective surface. The technique has since been widely adopted in, for example, the HOBBY – EBERLY TELESCOPE . Keck I began science operations in 1993 May, and was followed in 1996 October by Keck II. A large and varied suite of instruments has been developed for the telescopes, most notably an ADAPTIVE OPTICS system that permits the Kecks’ imaging cameras and spectrographs to achieve maximum efficiency.

Wo lf, Charles Joseph Étienne (1827–1918) and Rayet, Georges Antoine Pons (1839–1906) French astronomers who discovered a new class of high- temperature stars, now known as WOLF – RAYET STARS . Rayet worked at the Paris and Bordeaux observatories and was first director (1879) of the observatory at Floriac, France. Wolf also worked at Paris, and it was there, while examining spectra of the nova that appeared in 1866 May, that he and Rayet noticed wide, bright emission lines (later identified with helium, carbon and oxygen) that they later found (1867) also in the spectra of three hot, luminous stars in Cygnus. Wolf diagram Plot of the number of stars within a given brightness range against APPARENT MAGNITUDE . The number of stars normally increases by about 250% for each decrease in the brightness by one stellar magnitude. However, if there is a DARK NEBULA along the line of sight, then the observed curve will deviate from the theoretical one at some point. The apparent magnitude where the curves deviate may be used to estimate the distance of the nebula. For thin nebulae, the physical depth of the nebula may also be found from the magnitude at which the observed curve resumes its theoretical trend. Maximilian WOLF first plotted the diagram. Wolf, (Johann) Rudolf (1816–93) Swiss solar astronomer who independently discovered the 11-year solar activity cycle by logging the numbers of sunspots that appear over this period of time. Director of the Bern Observatory (1847–55) and founder (1864) of the Zürich Observatory, Wolf related sunspot activity to geomagnetic storms on Earth. In 1849 he devised a way of accurately counting the number of sunspots and groups, formerly known as the Zürich or Wolf number ( see RELATIVE SUNSPOT NUMBER ). Wo lf, Maximilian Franz Joseph Cornelius (‘Max’) (1863–1932) German astronomer, who was a pioneer of astrophotography, discovering 232 minor planets and dark nebulae in the Milky Way. He was the long-time (1893–1932) director of Heidelberg’s Königstuhl Observatory. Among Wolf ’s asteroid discoveries were (323) Brucia, the first found photographically, in 1898, and (588) Achilles, the first TROJAN ASTEROID identified, in 1906. His star counts of his wide-field Milky Way photographs enabled him to map huge dark clouds of obscuring gas and dust. He discovered that planetary nebulae are gaseous shells. Before it was understood that the ‘spiral nebulae’ were other galaxies, Wolf obtained many spectra of these objects, showing (1908) that they were composed of stars. He observed and catalogued over 6000 nebulae and galaxies, including many members of the Coma and Perseus galaxy clusters; the majority of these objects were newly discovered. Wolf number See RELATIVE SUNSPOT NUMBER Wolf–Rayet star (WR star) Hot star that is experiencing high mass loss. The spectra of Wolf–Rayet stars show broad emission lines, making them easy to identify in spectroscopic observations, even at large distances. First recognized by the French astronomers Charles WOLF and George Rayet in 1867, Wolf–Rayet stars are divided into three broad spectroscopic classes – WN, WC and WO. WN stars show EMISSION LINES predominantly of helium and nitrogen, although emission lines of carbon, silicon and hydrogen can be observed in some spectra. The spectra of WC stars are dominated by carbon and helium emission lines with no hydrogen and nitrogen. The more rare WO stars are similar to WC stars, with oxygen lines and lines of other elements showing high ionization. Wolf–Rayet stars have surface temperatures between 25,000 and 50,000 K, luminosities between 100,000 and one million times that of the Sun, and masses from 10 to 50 solar masses. The very high luminosities generate a radiation pressure that drives a wind of gas up to a rate of 10 solar masses in a million years. The average maximum velocity of material ejected from WR stars is 800 to over 3000 km/s (500–1900 mi/s). Wolf–Rayet stars demonstrate quite dramatically the effect that mass loss can have on massive stars.

Many central stars of PLANETARY NEBULAE are WR stars. About 220 WR stars are known in our Galaxy, but this is a lower limit because most WR stars are hidden from view by dust.

Wrinkle ri dges are abundant on the plains of the Moon, Mercury and Mars; they are interpreted to be compressional tectonic structures.

From one of the components (of spectral class A or F) ejection of material is taking place. The system evolves rapidly and the period is increasing. One of the two stars itself may be an INTRINSIC VARIABLE . W Ursae Majoris star (EW) One of the three main subtypes of ECLIPSING BINARY . W Ursae Majoris stars exhibit continuously varying light-curves, with primary and secondary minima of identical or almost identical depth. They differ from BETA LYRAE STARS in being smaller, less luminous stars of nearly identical brightness. The stellar cores are surrounded by a common convective envelope. W Ursae Majoris stars are CONTACT BINARIES . They are thought to be possible precursors of DW ARF NOVAE and other CATACLYSMIC VARIABLES . W Virginis star (CW) Type of pulsating V ARIABLE STAR superficially similar to a CEPHEID VARIABLE . On the HERTZSPRUNG – R USSELL DIAGRAM they typically lie in the spectral class range G0 to M0 and the absolute luminosity range M v = \u0002 1 to \u0002 4; they are thus giant stars. Their masses could be as low as 0.5 solar mass, suggesting that they have evolved from low-mass MAIN - SEQUENCE stars. They lie on the INSTABILITY STRIP on the HR diagram, which goes from Delta Scuti stars on the main sequence through the RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids to the irregular variables and Mira stars; therefore the cause of their variation is thought to be the same, that is, a layer of ionized helium within the star. W Virginis stars may be distinguished from classical Cepheids by the less-regular shape of their light-curves and the double-peaked nature of their maxima. Their periods range from approximately one day to 100 days and their PERIOD – LUMINOSITY LAW is distinctly different from that of the Cepheids. They do not form a homogeneous group: some belong to Population I and some to Population II. Occasionally W Virginis stars show small period changes. RU Camelopardalis, however, is a remarkable case: its va ri a tions suddenly stopped in 1964 for about three years. The spectral type of RU Camelopardalis (KO to R2 with excess carbon) is later than usual for W Virginis stars, but the star is otherwise unremarkable. It is not understood how pulsations can stop, or start, in such a short time. Because these stars are brighter than the RR Lyraes, but fainter than the Cepheids, and have a well-defined period–luminosity relationship, they may be used to estimate distances for galactic and extragalactic objects. WZ Sagittae Star, originally classified as a RECURRENT NOVA , that has many similarities with the UGEM INORUM DW ARF NOVA class; it may be a link between the two types. F our outbursts have been observed, in 1913, 1946, 1978 and 2001. It is also an eclipsing system, with a period of 81.5 minutes. The light-curve at eclipse resembles that of a W URSAE MAJORIS STAR . WZ Sagittae is normally around magnitude 15.5 at minimum, but has reached 7.0 during an outburst. Possible masses of the components are 0.59 and 0.03 solar mass.

X-ray astronomy Study of energetic processes and extreme physical conditions – high temperatures, winds and accretion disks, neutron stars and black holes. X-rays are generated by several environments: hot gas with a temperature greater than 1,000,000 K will emit radiation through atomic lines and thermal bremsstrahlung; high- energy electrons scattered by low-energy electrons produce X-rays (inverse COMPTON EFFECT ); electrons in strong magnetic fields emit SYNCHROTRON RADIATION ; and hot stars emit thermal BLACK BODY RADIATION . X-rays are also generated when material such as hydrogen ignites in NUCLEAR REACTIONS . The X-ray wavelength region is around 0.04 to 2.5 nm, but this is more usually expressed as from 0.5 to 30 keV, since X-rays are often measured in energy terms as kilo-electron-volts (keV). Hard X-rays are usually regarded as those in the range 10 keV and above, and soft X-rays lower than 10 keV. Many types of astronomical object emit X-rays, from the Sun, with a CORONA of around 2,000,000 K, to BINARY STARS containing a compact object ( see X - RAY BINARY ), to galaxies with a supermassive BLACK HOLE at the centre. However, X-rays from astronomical objects cannot be detected from the ground: 10 cm of air at ground-level, or three sheets of paper, will stop 90% of 3-keV X-rays. X-ray astronomy began in 1949 with the discovery that the Sun emitted X-rays, and the subsequent study of its general properties, by Herbert FRIEDMAN , Burnight and co-workers, using a Geiger counter on a V2 and other sounding rockets. This work, together with that using the UK Ariel I satellite, built and launched by NASA in 1962, established that high-temperature (about 10 7 K) plasma was created in the corona during solar FLARES . Solar X-ray studies continued through the 1960s and 1970s with several NASA satellites, including the Orbiting Solar Observatory and the SOLAR MAXIMUM MISSION . The Sun is not a strong emitter of X-rays, so it w as a major surprise when Riccardo GIACCONI and colleagues discovered a strong X-ray source in the constellation of Scorpius ( SCORPIUS X -1) in 1962 using a sounding rocket. By 1970, after some dozens of sounding rocket flights that gave a total exposure of only a few hours, about 50 individual X-ray sources had been discovered, including the CRAB NEBULA , the galaxy CENTAURUS A , the quasar 3 C 273, and a diffuse X-ray emission component (the X-ray background), which appeared to be isotropic at energies above 2 keV. The launching of the UHURU satellite by NASA in 1970 December marked the beginning of a new era for X-ray astronomy. It carried out an all-sky survey resulting in the discovery of more than 400 discrete X-ray sources. More satellites followed, including the UK Ariel V satellite and the NASA COPERNICUS satellite. In 1978 NASA launched the EINSTEIN OBSERVATORY satellite, which carried an X - RAY TELESCOPE with an angular resolution of a few arcseconds. This satellite ushered in a new era in X-ray astronomy. Consisting of a large nested grazing- incidence X-ray telescope, it responded to photons in the 0.1–4 keV energy range. The combination of good angular resolution and high sensitivity led to the discovery of several thousand new X-ray sources during the 2 \u0001 \u0002 -year operational life of the satellite. Recent X-ray satellites include EXOSAT launched in 1983, R OSAT in 1990, and CHANDRA and NEWTON , both launched in 1999. There are now more than 150,000 X-ray sources known. X-rays have even been detected from the Moon (reflected solar coronal X-rays) and from comets. X-ray spectra show highly ionized lines of oxygen, iron and other heavy elements, often with so many electrons stripped from the atom that they mimic the hydrogen spectral series. It has been found that many types of ordinary star emit X-rays. BROWN DWARFS have been detected with X-rays from their coronae. A population of WHITE DWARFS has been found to be continuously emitting X-rays because material is being accreted from the companion on to the surface of the white dwarf and bu r nt, with temperatures of several hundred thousand degrees – a unique situation of steady nuclear burning at the surface of a compact star. X-ray astronomy established that NEUTRON STARS w ere present in binary star systems; CYGNUS X -1 is one of the best candidates for a system containing a BLACK HOLE . It has revolutionized our understanding of the end of a star’s life and of compact objects. The surface of a PULSAR in Vela has been detected in X-rays, as have some other young pulsars. The surface temperature of the neutron star in the Vela Pulsar is around 1,000,000 K. Binary star systems containing a compact object show a va r iety of phenomena, depending on the mass and geometry of the members. The presence of an A CCRETION DISK in the system means that the X-ray emission can be intermittent ( see X - RAY BURSTERS ; X - RAY NOVAE ). The strange X-ray binary SS 433, with its relativistic JETS , was found to emit X-rays. Some 200 SUPERNOVA REMNANTS have been found by their extended X-ray emission, which comes from very hot gas behind the shock front. SUPERNOVA 1987 A w as observed by R OSAT several times; X-rays were first detected in 1992, becoming steadily stronger. When the ANDROMEDA GALAXY w as observed by R OSAT, around 550 sources were detected, about the same number as the bright X-ray sources in our own Galaxy. The LARGE MAGELLANIC CLOUD (LMC) has a source (LMC X-3) that is very similar to Cygnus X-1, with a possible black hole as the compact object in the massive X-ray binary star system. Many galaxies emit X-rays ( see X - RAY GALAXY ); clusters of galaxies (for example Coma, Virgo, Perseus) emit X-rays from hot intergalactic gas. Observations have shown that the Sun is embedded in a bubble of hot gas around 160 l.y. in diameter, with a temperature of over 1,000,000 K – perhaps heated by a long-past supernova explosion. In Cygnus there is a superbubble of hot (1,000,000 K) gas, with a density of about 0.001 particles/cm 3 . The superbubble is over 1000 l.y. across, possibly the largest structure in the Galaxy, and this may be the result of a cluster of stars becoming supernovae.

The UHURU satellite originally showed that some X-ray stars underwent eclipses, revealing that they were close binary systems (for example HERCULES X -1). There are several types of X-ray binary system, with properties that depend upon the nature of the compact object. There are massive (high-mass) X-ray binaries and low-mass X-ray binaries (low-mass implies stars around the mass of the Sun). Low-mass X-ray binaries containing a neutron star tend to be X - RAY BURSTERS , for example SCORPIUS X -1 and Hercules X-1. Low mass X-ray binaries with a white dwarf as the compact object are CATACLYSMIC VARIABLES . When the companion star shedding the material is a massive star (for CYGNUS X -1 the mass is more than 30 solar masses), the star can often be detected optically. The strong stellar wind transfers material directly on to the compact object. X-ray pulsars are usually found in binary systems with high-mass companions. SS433 is an unusual massive X-ray binary, with a possible black hole as the compact object; it shows relativistic JETS . X-ray burster Source with intense flashes, or bursts, of X-rays. The bursts have rise times of around 1 second and can last as little as 10 seconds, yet the energy released is equivalent to a week’s output from the Sun (or more). A few X-ray bursts have been detected at optical wa v elengths. X-ray bursters are BINARY STAR systems in which one star is a NEUTRON STAR . The neutron star is surrounded by a hydrogen-rich A CCRETION DISK from a low-mass companion star (around one solar mass). The h ydrogen flows from the accretion disk on to the surface of the neutron star and is burnt to helium ( see NUCLEAR REACTIONS ). When the amount of helium on the surface of the neutron star exceeds a critical amount, the helium suddenly ignites, causing a burst of X-rays. The temperature can rise to 30 million K at the peak of the bu r st and 10 seconds later fall back to 15 million K. Almost 30 X-ray bursters have been found in GLOBULAR CLUSTERS ; for example, the first was found in NGC 6624 (Omega Centauri has five, M22 has four). They are generally found close to the centre of the cluster, where the star density is very high. These X-ray bursters are also thought to be binary stars, with a neutron star accreting material from a low-mass companion star. X-ray galaxy Galaxy that emits powerfully in the X-ray part of the ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM , indicating that it probably has a large or supermassive black hole at its centre, with an A CCRETION DISK . These galaxies include active galaxies (such as NGC 4151 and Centaurus A), SEYFERT GALAXIES , QU ASARS and BL LACERTAE OBJECTS , many of which are also radio sources. X-ray galaxies often appear to be merging or colliding systems. X-ray nova BINARY STAR system that occasionally becomes bright at X-ray wavelengths. One member of the binary is a WHITE DWARF and the other is a low-mass g iant (usually around one solar mass). Material from the g iant star falls on to the white dwarf, and eventually there is so much material on the surface that it ignites ( see NUCLEAR REACTIONS ) causing the X-ray emission, which will fade away over weeks or months. It is assumed that this will recur, but the timescale may be decades or centuries. DW ARF NOVAE have A CCRETION DISKS , so the material falls on to the white dwarf from the disk rather than from the companion star. Although the outburst is less dramatic (hence the adjective ‘dwarf ’), the outburst can occur frequently, even as often as every week or two. X-ray star Star that is a powerful source of X-rays. The detection of X-rays from a star usually means the star is a CLOSE BINARY system, with one member being a compact object, either a WHITE DWARF , NEUTRON STAR or BLACK HOLE ( see X - RAY BINARY ). However, even the Sun emits X- rays, from its CORONA , as do other stars. Massive hot O stars (such as CYGNUS X -3) emit X-rays because of their high temperatures and high mass-loss in their stellar winds. X-ray telescope Instrument for imaging X-ray sources. All X-ray telescopes are satellite-borne because X-rays do not penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere. Unlike less energetic electromagnetic radiation, X-rays cannot be focused by reflection from a conventional concave mirror (as in a reflecting telescope) because, for all but the shallowest angles of incidence, they penetrate the surface. In grazing incidence X-ray telescopes the focusing element is a pair of coaxial surfaces, one P ARABOLOIDAL and the other HYPERBOLOIDAL , from which incoming X-rays are reflected at a very low ‘grazing’ angle towards a focus. The detecting element is often a CCD adapted for X-ray wavelengths. An alternative instrument is the microchannel plate detector, in which the incident radiation falls on a plate made up of many fine tubes, rather like a short, wide fibre- optic bundle. The plate is charged, so that the radiation generates electrons which are accelerated down the tubes and together form an image that can be read off. X-ray telescopes have been flown on missions such as Y OHKOH , the CHANDRA X - RAY OBSERVATORY and NEWTON . X-ray transient X-ray outburst from a BINARY STAR system; it is similar to an X - RAY NOVA outburst but lasts for a longer period. The X-ray source will brighten suddenly and fade away after a few weeks (or occasionally months). More than 30 objects have been found to show X-ray transients. Some NEUTRON STARS have hot companion stars and some have cool (K or M), low-mass companions. The transient indicates that mass transfer is erratic for some (unknown) reason. See also X - RAY BURSTER X X-ray burster 442 \u0001 X-ray binary The strong X-ray source Cygnus X-3 is a close binary system in which matter from a normal star is being drawn into a neutron star or black hole.

The observatory owes its foundation to George Ellery HALE , who persuaded the streetcar magnate Charles Tyson Yerkes (1837–1905) to finance the great telescope. The observatory also has 1.02-m (40-in.) and 0.6-m (24-in) reflectors and a number of smaller instruments. Gerard KUIPER used the 40-inch to discover MIRANDA in 1948 and NEREID the year after. Today, though LIGHT POLLUTION limits observational astronomy from the William Bay site, Yerkes is still a major research institution and its astronomers use such facilities as the Astrophysics Research Consortium’s 3.5-m (138-in.) telescope at Apache Point, New Mexico, the HUBBLE SPACE TELESCOPE and the telescopes of the W .

The solid surface rotates at only about 4 m/s (13 ft/s). Y ohkoh (Sunbeam) Solar X-ray satellite, a collaboration between the Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), NASA and the UK. Launched from the Kagoshima Space Centre in 1991 August, the spacecraft has observed the solar atmosphere continuously for more than an entire cycle of solar activity. Y ohkoh’s main scientific objective is to observe the energetic phenomena taking place on the Sun, especially X-ray and gamma-ray emissions from solar FLARES . It carries four instruments that detect these energetic emissions – two spectrometers, a soft X-ray telescope (SXT) and a hard X-ray telescope (HXT). The observations of spectral lines provide information about the temperature and density of the hot plasma in the Sun’s atmosphere, and about motions of the plasma along the line of sight. The SXT images X-rays in the range 0.25–4.0 keV and can resolve features down to 2 \u0001 .5 in size. Flare images can be obtained every 2 seconds. Smaller images with a single filter can be obtained as frequently as once every 0.5 seconds. The HXT observes hard X-rays in four energy bands and can resolve structures with angular sizes of about 5 \u0001 . These images can also be obtained once every 0.5 seconds. Y ohkoh played an important role in improving understanding of processes in the solar atmosphere. Of particular interest were the origin of solar flares, the link between such flares and coronal mass ejections, studies of coronal holes and the evolution of magnetic loops. The Yohkoh spacecraft is in a slightly elliptical low Earth orbit, with an altitude ranging from approximately 570 to 730 km (355 to 455 mi); 65 to 75 minutes of each 90-minute orbit are spent in sunlight.

Z Camelopardalis stars differ from the common dwarf nova class ( see U GEMINORUM STAR ) in that they experience occasional ‘standstills’, remaining more or less constant in brightness for a long period. These standstills always seem to begin during a decline from maximum. When the standstill ends, the star drops to minimum brightness, and then resumes its ‘normal’ behaviour. Both the occurrence of the standstills and their duration, ranging from a few days to many months, are quite unpredictable. Z Camelopardalis itself is the brightest member of the class. It may reach magnitude 10.2 at brightest and falls to about 14.5 at minimum. The usual interval between outbursts is roughly 22 days. Zeeman effect Splitting of a spectral line into several components by the presence of a magnetic field. Where the components are unresolved, a broadened line is seen.

In the early 1970s, Zel’dovich and others developed a model of the early Universe in which huge discrete lumps of primordial matter collapsed asymmetrically under their own weight as they cooled, forming thin ‘pancakes’.

This is known as the astronomical zenith. Because the Earth is not a sphere, the geocentric zenith is defined as a line joining the centre of the Earth to the observer. The point 180º away from the zenith, directly beneath an observer, is the NADIR . zenith distance Angular distance from the ZENITH to a celestial body, measured along a GREAT CIRCLE . It is usually expressed as a topocentric measure, from the observer’s position on the Earth’s surface, but sometimes geocentric, as measured by a hypothetical observer at the centre of the Earth. The zenith distance is equal to 90º minus the altitude of the body above the horizon. zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) Useful index of METEOR SHOWER activity, allowing comparison of observations made at different times and under different sky conditions. Zenithal hourly rate is determined by allowing for the altitude ( a ) of the shower RADIANT during observations, the stellar limiting magnitude ( LM ), and the POPULATION INDEX ( r , indicative of the proportions of faint meteors that might be lost to background skyglow in the shower under study).

A body in a ‘zero gr a vity’ or free-fall state experiences no sensation of w eight, hence the ‘weightlessness’ of astronauts, since the spacecraft is continuously free falling towards the Earth while its transverse motion ensures that it gets no closer. The term ‘zero gravity’ does not imply a total absence of gr a vity, rather it refers to an absence of any detectable gr a vitational forces.

At these times, the ecliptic is steeply inclined relative to the western or eastern horizon respectively. From lower latitudes – between the tropics and the equator – viewing conditions for the zodiacal light are favourable throughout the year. Transparent skies and the absence of moonlight (even a crescent moon can swamp it) are essential for successful observation of the zodiacal light. Broadest at its base, the zodiacal light extends some 60–90º along the ecliptic from the Sun, and it is produced by the scattering of sunlight from myriad small (1–300 \u0001 m diameter) particles lying in the plane of the planets’ orbits. This material, originating from emissions by comets close to perihelion and collisions in the asteroid belt, forms a vast zodiacal dust complex, which permeates the inner Solar System out to the orbit of Jupiter, 5 AU from the Sun. Spacecraft measurements show that the dust is very much less abundant beyond Jupiter. The zodiacal light is joined around the ecliptic to the GEGENSCHEIN by narrow faint extensions known as the zodiacal bands. Variations in the intensity of the zodiacal light are thought to occur, with maximum brightness being found at sunspot minimum when interplanetary space is pervaded by fast-flowing particle streams from coronal holes. The zodiacal dust complex contains a mass of material estimated to be equivalent to that of a typical comet nucleus; without continual replenishment from active comets, the complex and its associated zodiacal light would probably disappear within about 10,000 years. Zöllner, (Johann Karl) Friedrich (1834–82) German inventor of astronomical instruments and pioneer astrophysicist. In the late 1850s and early 1860s, he perfected the astronomical PHOTOMETER , with which the relative brightnesses of stars are measured accurately by comparing them with an artificial star produced by a petroleum lamp. The Potsdam Observatory used this instrument to compile the first photometric star catalogue, the Photometrische Durchmusterung des nördlichen Himmels . He also invented the ‘reversion spectroscope’ – based on the same principles as the HELIOMETER – which Hermann Carl VOGEL used to calculate the Sun’s rotation period. In theoretical astrophysics, Zöllner introduced the idea that a star’s temperature determines its spectral characteristics, and that these attributes are both related to the star’s evolutionary stage. Zöllner photometer Visual PHOTOMETER that uses a fixed and a rotating polarizing element to vary the apparent brightness of an artificial star until it is the same as a real star seen in the same field of view. The amount of rotation of the polarizer can be calibrated to give the APPARENT MAGNITUDE of the real star. Z Zöllner photometer 445 \u0001 zodiacal light Produced by scattering of sunlight from interplanetary dust, the zodiacal light appears as a conical glow extending along the ecliptic in the late-evening or pre-dawn sky. In this photograph, the planet Venus is visible at lower right.

It typically spans 10º on either side of the galactic plane. Some kinds of galaxies in the zone of av oidance can now be detected by their radio, infrared or X-ray emissions, which are less vulnerable to dust and gas absorption. Surveys of such galaxies are important for tracing LARGE - SCALE STRUCTURE , since some important nearby SUPERCLUSTERS and the GREAT ATTRACTOR either cross the zone of avoidance or lie mostly within it.

Zwicky, Fritz (1898–1974) Swiss physicist and astrophysicist, born in Bulgaria, known chiefly for his observational and theoretical work on supernovae and his cataloguing of clusters of galaxies. He left Switzerland for the United States in 1925, joining the CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY in 1927, where he was appointed professor of astrophysics in 1942. Although Zwicky lived in America for nearly fifty years, he retained his Swiss citizenship. In 1934 he and Walter BAADE coined the term ‘super- nova’. They had noted that ordinary novae in the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) reached a maximum average apparent magnitude of 17. However, the ‘nova’ observed in 1885 in that galaxy, designated S Andromedae, had reached 7th magnitude, and now that the great distance to M31 was appreciated, it was clear that this was a phenomenon of a different order from ordinary novae. Zwicky and Baade suggested that a supernova is a cataclysmic stellar explosion that leaves behind a neutron star, and that the CRAB NEBULA w as a supernova remnant (the latter confirmed in 1968 with the discovery of the CRAB PULSAR ). From 1936, using the newly developed Schmidt camera, Zwicky discovered and examined many supernovae in other galaxies. In 1933 Zwicky inferred the presence of dark matter by observing that outlying members of the COMA CLUSTER w ere moving more rapidly than could be explained by the calculated mass of the cluster, and four y ears later he suggested that dark matter could be investigated via gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies. His extensive studies of galaxies culminated in the six-volume Catalogue of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies (1961–68), listing 30,000 galaxies and 10,000 clusters, compiled with colleagues and completed just before his death. ZZ Ceti star (ZZ) White dwarf V ARIABLE STAR , with low amplitude (0.001–0.2 mag.). The variations arise from non-radial pulsations, and generally multiple periods are present simultaneously in each star. Periods range from about 30 seconds to 25 minutes. There are three recognized subtypes based upon the presence of h ydrogen, helium, or helium and carbon absorption lines in the spectra. Approximately 50 examples are currently known.
