The images included in this beautiful volume are quite staggering in what they reveal about the Universe we live in and have already become part of our common scientific and cultural heritage. But what about the science impact? It is no exaggeration to say that the scientific output of the mission has far exceeded the most optimistic expectations of all those involved in the planning and execution of the project. When I joined the project in 1977, I had to describe the astronomy programme I would carry out with the Hubble once it was in operation in orbit. Seventeen years later when I received my first data, I was quite staggered by the quality of the images and also by the totally new science which they revealed about the ways in which relativistic jets can illuminate the environments of active galaxies. This is a repeated theme in essentially all areas explored by the Telescope. The images are not only beautiful, but are full of spectacular new science, much of it undreamed of by the astronomers involved. A good example is the discovery of protostellar discs seen in silhouette against the bright background of the Orion Nebula. Another is the ability to discover distant star forming galaxies by imaging in a number of wavebands. The observation of distant supernovae has enabled the present acceleration of the Universe as a whole to be measured – an undoubted triumph. And then there are the spectacular images of the Hubble Deep and Ultra-Deep Fields which have revealed what are almost certainly young galaxies in the process of forming the galaxies and larger scale structures we observe about us today. But these are only a few random samples of the wealth of scientific knowledge which has accrued from the mission. Every picture tells a wonderful story which has already been built into our picture of the evolving Universe. What are the lessons to be learned from this spectacular success? The route to new understanding is through the ability to observe the Universe in new ways with tech- niques, that extend observational capability by a factor of 10 or more. In the case of the Hubble Space Telescope, the gains in angular resolution, or sharpness, and correspond- ing sensitivity, as well as the remarkable stability of the instruments in the remote environment of space, have given it unprecedented power to uncover new astrophysics. The results are a wonderful tribute to the dedicated efforts of many scientists, astrono- mers, engineers, managers and administrators, as well as to the vision of NASA and ESA in enabling the Hubble Space Telescope to come about. Long may this vision and the ability to inspire the public imagination continue as an essential means of deepening our understanding of the Universe.

The communication of scientific discoveries and information about scientists and their work to the public are vital components of the scientific process. However, the competition for attention in today’s mass-media market is fierce. This book takes a closer look at what may be the world’s most successful scientific project. The fifteenth anniversary of Hubble’s launch, which took place on the 24th April 1990, presented the ideal opportunity for a spectacular project to seize the attention of the public. The story of a journey through space and time revealed by the telescope is told in a way that we hope will appeal especially to the younger generation. It will be their enthu- siasm that powers the future of the scientific endeavour.

Hubble has been hugely successful in many different areas of astronomy. How does it differ from other famous telescopes? Hubble orbits 600 km above the Earth's surface, placing it well above our image- distorting atmosphere. It can be upgraded to take advantage of the latest developments in instrumentation and software. The telescope is designed to take high-resolution images and accurate spectra by concentrating light to form sharper images than are possible from the ground, where the atmospheric 'twinkling' of the stars limits the clarity. Therefore, despite its relatively modest aperture of 2.4 metres, Hubble is more than able to compete with ground-based telescopes that have light-collecting (i.e. mirror) areas 10 or even 20 times larger. As well as being able to take sharper wide-field images, the other huge advantage Hubble has over ground-based telescopes is its ability to observe the near-infrared and ultraviolet light that is otherwise filtered away or masked by the atmosphere before it can reach the ground. In many areas of astronomical investigation, Hubble has pushed the limit of our knowl- edge far, far beyond anything possible before its launch. NGC 1300 NGC 1300 is considered to be prototypical of barred spiral galaxies. Barred spirals differ from normal spiral galaxies in that the arms of the galaxy do not spiral all the way into the centre, but are connected to the two ends of a straight bar of stars containing the nucleus at its centre. 9 NASA, ESA, and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA)"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"THE HUBBLE STORY H ubble finally allowed astronomers to realise their dream of escaping the distorting effects of the Earth’s atmosphere to make their observations. Achieving an operational observatory in space was no small task: it took decades of planning and construction in a project of such scale and cost that it demanded international collabora- tion and the work of many dedicated engineers and scientists. The con- cept of a telescope that could be upgraded and serviced regularly by astronauts has resulted in capabilities and scientific discoveries far beyond the expectations of the designers.

Looking at the night sky we see the familiar twinkle of starlight; light that has travelled enormous distances to reach us. But the stars themselves do not flicker. The Universe is gloriously transparent, allowing light from distant stars and galaxies to travel unchanged across space for thousands, millions, even billions of years. Then, in the last few microseconds before the light reaches our eyes, the fine details in the view of those stars and galaxies are snatched away. This is because, as light passes through our atmosphere, the ever changing blankets of air, water vapour and dust, blur the image that finally reaches us. To solve this problem, astronomers around the world longed for an observatory in space for many years. As early as 1923, the famed German rocket scientist Hermann Oberth suggested a space-based telescope. However, it was decades before technology caught up with the dream. The American astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposed a more realistic plan for a space telescope in 1946. From a position in space above the Earth's atmosphere, a telescope could detect the pristine light from stars, galaxies, and other objects before their images become distorted by the air we breathe. The result: much sharper images than even the largest telescopes on the ground could achieve; images limited in sharpness only by the quality of the optics. In the 1970s, NASA – the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and ESA the European Space Agency began working together to design and build what would become the Hubble Space Telescope. The name is a tribute to Edwin Powell Hubble, the founder of modern cosmol- ogy, who, in the 1920s, first showed that not all we see in the sky lies within the Milky Way. Instead, the cosmos extends far, far beyond. Hubble's work changed our perception of mankind's place in the Universe forever and the choice of naming th most magnificent telescope after Edwin Hubble could not have been more appropriate. –– – is For many years astronomers longed for an observatory in space ESA"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Above the Ocean of Air A ground-based telescope similar in size to Hubble produced the image of the barred galaxy NGC 1300 on the left. From its position in space above the Earth's atmosphere, Hubble obtained the picture on the right of the same galaxy. A technique called 'Adaptive Optics' can be used to sharpen ground-based images and is extremely effective when used with telescopes much larger than Hubble (see box below). Hubble vs. Adaptive Optics The technique of Adaptive Optics can sharpen images from large ground-based telescopes to attain a higher resolution and is being vigorously developed by astronomers around the World. Such observations are highly complementary to those made by Hubble since they can exploit the collecting power of much larger telescopes and can be used very effectively to feed such light-hungry instruments as spectrographs. This higher resolution is achieved over a small patch of the sky and and the technique works better at infrared wavelengths than it does in the visible spectrum used by Hubble. Hubble remains supreme for mapping parts of the sky in exquisite detail in ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared light. Why is Hubble in orbit around the Earth? The Earth’s atmosphere both absorbs and emits light. Beyond the blue end of the visible spectrum, the presence of ozone ensures that little ultraviolet light reaches the ground. Towards the red end and beyond, into what astronomers call the near-infrared spectrum, there is considerable absorption by water vapour and molecular oxygen but also, the sky is brightened by intense emission from the OH radical (an unstable molecule consisting of an oxygen and a hydrogen atom). The visible spectrum alone remains reasonably free from these effects. The entire spectral range from ultraviolet through the near-infrared remains cleanly accessible to Hubble. 13 NASA, ESA, and The Hubble Heritage Team (STScI/AURA) Hillary Mathis/NOAO/AURA/NSF"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"It took two decades of dedicated collaboration between scientists, engineers and contractors from many countries before Hubble was finally finished. On April 24, 1990, five astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery left on a journey that changed our vision of the Universe for ever! They deployed the eagerly anticipated Space Telescope in an orbit roughly 600 km above the Earth’s surface. On Earth, astronomers waited impatiently for the first results. After extensive technical verification and testing, it soon became obvious that Hubble’s vision was anything but sharp. The mirror had a serious flaw. A defect in the shape of the mirror prevented Hubble from taking clear images. The mirror’s edge was too flat by only a mere fiftieth of the width of a human hair. But to accomplish its mission, Hubble had to be perfect in every tiny detail. The disappointment was almost too great to bear. Not only amongst astronomers, but also for American and European taxpayers. Nevertheless, over the following two years, scientists and engineers from NASA and ESA worked together to design and build a corrective optics package, named COSTAR, for Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement. They were also able to build in a perfect correction to the replacement camera that was already planned for installation. Hubble’s masters now faced another tough decision: which science instrument should they remove so that COSTAR could be fitted to Hubble? They eventually chose the High Speed Photometer. Hubble’s First Servicing Mission, performed in 1993, has gone down in history as one of the supreme highlights of human spaceflight. It captured the attention of both astrono- mers and the public at large to a degree that no Space Shuttle mission has since achieved. Meticulously planned and brilliantly executed, the mission succeeded on all counts. COSTAR and the new Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) corrected Hubble’s eyesight more perfectly than anyone had dared to hope. Hubble's mirror problem The cause of the problem was a defect in the 2.4 metre diameter primary mirror caused by the incorrect assembly of the optical system used to test the mirror during manufacture. This resulted in what is called ‘spherical aberration’. Fortunately, the test system remained untouched in the lab and it was possible for engineers to go back and use it to reconstruct the nature of the error with great precision. This is why the Servicing Missions were so successful in correcting Hubble’s optics to near-perfection. 14"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"When the first images after the servicing came up on the computer screens it was instantly clear that the ‘glasses’ taken up by the astronauts were completely correcting Hubble's vision. Hubble was finally in business! That was only the first time the Space Shuttle visited Hubble. The telescope was designed to be upgraded, enabling it to take advantage of new technologies and software. When more advanced instruments, electrical or mechanical components became available, they could be installed by the astronauts. So, just as a car needs servicing so Hubble needs tuning-up from time to time. Engineers and scientists periodically send the Shuttle to Hubble so that astronauts can upgrade it, using wrenches, screwdrivers and power tools, just as a mechanic might with a car. There have been four Servicing Missions so far: in 1993, 1997, 1999 and 2002. All were undertaken by astronauts transported into space by NASA’s Space Shuttle. The next one was supposed to occur in 2005, but was unfortunately cancelled in the aftermath of the tragic Columbia crash. Hubble’s future is uncertain. It was originally designed to operate for 15 years, but it is now expected that its life could be extended to 20 years. Hubble is still producing the most astonishing results that astronomers have ever known.

It is too massive a spacecraft to burn up completely in the atmosphere on re-entry and an uncontrolled plunge into the atmosphere is a potential danger to residents of regions covering a broad swathe of our planet. The plan is for an unmanned probe to link up with Hubble in orbit and dock with it. The probe will leave behind a rocket-module so that, after some more years of fruitful observing, engineers on the ground can activate these rockets to control Hubble’s final descent into the atmosphere. However, the retirement of the Hubble Space Telescope will not signal the end of our unrivalled view of the Universe. Rather, it will mark a new beginning, an era of even more amazing discoveries and images from space. For Hubble has a successor. The James Webb Space Telescope is currently being designed and may be launched as early as 2011. When that day comes, scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope hope to discover and understand even more about our fascinating Universe.

The systems that allow it to be pointed and stabilised are very sophisticated and are working extraordinarily well. Far from being an isolated resource for astronomers, Hubble has worked in close harmony with other satellites and ground-based observatories to lead, during its 15 years of operation, a huge leap in our understanding of the Universe. 2"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"22 ESA"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"23 H ubble is a space-based telescope that is designed to be upgraded and to adapt to changing needs and technologies. It orbits at almost 600 km above the Earth’s surface, placing it well above most of our image-distorting atmosphere and takes about 96 minutes to complete each orbit. It is designed to take high-resolution images and accurate spectra by concentrating starlight to form sharper images than are possible from the ground, where the atmo- spheric ‘twinkling’ of the stars limits the clarity. To gather as much light as possible from the faint objects it studies, any telescope needs the largest mirror it can get. Despite Hubble’s relatively modest mirror diameter of 2.4 metres, it is more than able to compete with ground-based telescopes that have mirrors 10 or 20 times larger in collecting area. Hubble is a large satellite; about 16 metres long or the size of a small bus. It is also one of the most complicated pieces of technology ever built. It contains more than 3000 sensors that continually read out the status of the hardware so that technicians on the ground can keep an eye on everything. Time on Hubble is a precious commodity. Astronomers across the world regularly ask for much more time than is available. Keeping Hubble working 24/7 is no small task. Not a single second must be lost and all tasks either observations or so-called ‘housekeeping’ tasks, such as repositioning of the telescope, or uploading new observing schedules — are meticulously planned. – Hubble's orbit Hubble orbits the Earth every 96 minutes at an altitude of nearly 600 km. The ever-changing aspect of its orbit makes the process of scheduling observations rather complicated. Is there competition between different observatories? A large and ambitious astronomical research project today would use large amounts of time on a whole range of different telescopes on the ground and in space. These telescopes, far from competing with one another, provide different and complementary views of astronomical sources that greatly increase our ability to understand the physical processes that create them. It is usually a case of \"the whole being greater than the sum of the parts\". Hubble plays an absolutely pivotal role in many of these programmes.

Two of them are needed to point and lock the telescope on the target and the third can be used for position measurements, also known as astrometry. STIS The Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) is currently not operating, but is a versatile multi-purpose instrument taking full advantage of modern technology. It combines a camera with a spectrograph and covers a wide range of wavelengths from the near-infrared region into the ultravio- let. NICMOS The Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) is an instrument for near-infrared imaging and spectroscopic observations of astronomical targets. NICMOS detects light with wavelengths between 800 and 2500 nanometres. ACS ACS is a so-called third generation Hubble instrument. Its wide field of view is nearly twice that of Hubble’s previous workhorse camera, WFPC2. The name, Advanced Camera for Surveys, comes from its particular ability to map relatively large areas of the sky in great detail. Primary mirror Hubble’s primary mirror is made of a special glass coated with aluminium and a special compound that reflects ultraviolet light. It is 2.4 metres in diameter and collects the light from stars and galaxies and reflects it to the secondary mirror. COSTAR COSTAR is not really a science instrument: it is the corrective optics package that replaced the High Speed Photometer (HSP) during the first servicing mission. COSTAR was designed to correct the effects of the primary mirror’s aberration.

Communication antennae Once Hubble observes a celestial object, its onboard computers convert the image or spectrum into long strings of numbers that, via one of Hubble's two antennae, are sent to one of the two satellites that form the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). Secondary mirror Like the primary mirror, Hubble’s secondary mirror is made of special glass coated with aluminium and a special compound to reflect ultraviolet light. It is 1/3 metre in diameter and reflects the light back through a hole in the primary mirror and into the instruments. Solar panels Hubble’s third set of solar arrays produce enough power to enable all the science instruments to operate simultaneously, thereby making Hubble even more efficient. The panels are rigid and unlike earlier versions, do not vibrate, making it possible to perform stable, pinpoint sharp observations. WFPC2 WFPC2 was Hubble’s workhorse camera until the installation of ACS. It records excellent quality images through a selection of 48 colour filters covering a spectral range from far- ultraviolet to visible and near-infrared wavelengths. WFPC2 has produced most of the stunning pictures that have been released as public outreach images over the years. Aperture door Hubble’s aperture door can be closed if Hubble is in danger of letting light from the Sun, Earth or Moon into the telescope. 25"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"26 For astronomers, the most important components of Hubble are its scientific instru- ments. There are two groups of instruments in Hubble, known as ‘radial’ mounted around Hubble’s waist; and ‘axial’ fitted at the back end of the spacecraft. The different instruments serve different purposes: some are for making images and some are designed to dissect the light from the stars and galaxies by spreading it out to form a rainbow-like spectrum. Hubble’s unique vantage point in space makes it capable of observing over a broader band of wavelengths than ground-based (optical) telescopes. It can observe ultraviolet light that is completely absorbed by Earth’s atmosphere. It can also see much more clearly in the near-infrared part of the spectrum where the Earth’s sky is very bright and not very transparent. These forms of light reveal properties of celestial objects that are otherwise hidden from us. Some instruments, like ACS the Advanced Camera for Surveys are better for visible and ultraviolet observations, some, like NICMOS the Near Infrared Camera and Multi- object Spectrograph are designed for infrared observations. Different mechanical and electrical components keep Hubble functioning. The power for Hubble comes from solar panels on the side that convert sunlight into electricity. Gyroscopes, star trackers and reaction wheels keep Hubble steady and pointing in the right direction for hours or days at a time: not too close to the Sun, Moon or Earth as they would destroy the light-sensitive instruments; and accurately towards the objects being studied. The Hubble pointing and tracking system is a triumph of engineering and relies on a complex hierarchy of systems that keep the entire spacecraft stable in space to an almost incredible precision. It can point to the same spot on the sky for weeks at a time without deviating by more than a few millionths of the Moon’s diameter. Hubble has several communications antennae on its side that are used for sending observations and other data down to Earth. Hubble sends its data first to a satellite in the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, which then downlinks the signal to White Sands, New Mexico, USA. The observations are sent from NASA in the United States to Europe where they are stored in a huge data archive in Munich, Germany. No single nation could undertake such an enormous project.

In this vast Universe, our closest relatives are the objects within the Solar System: we share the same origin and the same destiny. Our Solar System was formed about four and a half billion years ago from a huge gas cloud. Ironically, it could have been the deadly force of a thermonuclear blast from an exploding star in the vicinity that triggered our creation. The devastating force of the blast may have disturbed the precarious equilibrium of the original gas cloud, causing some of the matter to collapse inwards and creating a new star, our Sun. A minute percentage of the collapsing matter became the multifaceted assembly of planets that we have around us today. We are, in other words, just the leftovers of our Sun’s birth. The planets were born in the rotating disk of dust and gas left behind as our mother star was formed. The rocky planets formed in the inner Solar System while the enig sizable planets could maintain their gaseous surroundings and the last wisps of the tenuous cloud between the planets was whipped away. So, in our Solar System’s zoo of celestial bodies there are both rocky worlds and giant gaseous planets. Even now, there is no exact estimate of how much matter or even how many planets exist within our Solar System. Since Pluto’s discovery in the 1930s, and its satellite Charon’s in the 1970s, astronomers have tried to figure out if there is anything else out there beyond the ninth planet. In 2003, Hubble spotted something moving fast enough across the background of faraway stars to be an object within the Solar System. Estimates show that it could be about the size of a planet and it has been named Sedna, after an Inuit goddess. Sedna may be 1500 km in diameter about three quarters the size of Pluto, but it is so far away that it appears as just a small cluster of pixels even to Hubble. Nevertheless, it is the largest object discovered in the Solar System since Pluto. The Sun is about 15 billion km from Sedna 100 times further than Earth’s distance from the Sun and barely gives out as much light and heat as the full moon. So Sedna is engulfed in an eternal bleak winter. Sedna is not the only mysterious object out there. Debris from the formation of the planets is still floating everywhere in the form of asteroids and comets of various shapes and sizes. Sometimes their orbits can lead them on catastrophic courses. matic gas giants were formed further out.

The consequences of the impact could be seen for days afterwards and, by studying the Hubble data, astronomers were able to assemble fundamental information about the composition and density of the giant planet’s atmosphere. Space probes with sophisticated instruments are frequently sent to the planets of our Solar System. They provide close-up investigations of these distant places. While a few go into orbit around their destination planets and so can monitor them for long periods, most fly by quickly and gather some snapshots on the way. Although Hubble’s high resolution images can be surpassed by close-up pictures taken by planetary space probes, Hubble has the advantage of being able to carry out long-term monitoring. This is crucial for the study of planetary atmospheres and geology. Weather systems can reveal much about underlying atmospheric processes. Hubble provides its own unique service, by opening a window on our Solar System that is never closed. It can be used to monitor almost any planet in the Solar System (Mercury is too close to the Sun) regularly and to provide a long-term view of changes that is impossible to achieve in any other way. This is how we see developing storms on other planets; their changing seasons; and unprecedented views of other atmospheric events, such as aurorae, known on Earth as the northern and southern lights. Hubble’s extremely high resolution and sensitivity have resulted in unique observations of objects within the Solar System, providing amazing images and rich streams of data about the nature of these bodies. Hubble has seen unprecedented detail in Jupiter’s aurorae: while similar to those seen above the Earth's polar regions, they are almost 1000 times more energetic and much more complex. Jupiter’s aurorae can only be seen in ultraviolet light and, so they can never be studied with ground-based telescopes. Astonishing images of Saturn’s aurorae have also been taken and reveal that the glowing curtains of ultraviolet light rise more than a thousand kilometres above the cloud tops of the planet’s north and south poles. Mars up close This view of Mars, the sharpest photo of it ever taken from the vicinity of Earth, reveals small craters and other surface markings only a few tens of kilometers across.

Astronomers are beginning their search for life elsewhere in the Universe. The primary objective is to find earth-like planets. These are very much harder to detect than massive ‘Jupiters’ and, as yet, none have been found. Hubble had been in orbit for five years when the first planet around a Sun-like star was discovered. Although it was not designed to study these objects, Hubble’s versatility has allowed it to make significant contributions to this intensely interesting area of study. For example, Hubble’s high resolution has been indispensable in the investigation of the gas and dust disks, dubbed ‘proplyds’, around the newly born stars in the Orion Nebula. The proplyds may very well be young planetary systems in the early stages of creation. The details revealed by Hubble are superior to anything seen to date with ground-based instruments and, thanks to Hubble’s capability, we now have visual proof that dusty disks around young stars are common. Hubble has also measured the mass of a planet – only the second time such a calcula- tion has been performed with any accuracy – by detecting the way in which the planet causes its star to wobble. Hubble found the oldest planet so far known: it orbits a tiny stellar husk, which was once a blazing star like the Sun, and is located 5,600 light years away. The planet was once like Jupiter and is around 13 billion years old, almost three times older than our own planetary system. Saturn's aurora Astronomers combined ultraviolet images of Saturn's southern polar region with visible-light images of the planet and its rings to make this picture. The auroral display appears blue because of the glow of ultraviolet light. In reality, the aurora would appear red to an observer at Saturn because of the presence of glowing hydrogen in the atmosphere. The ultraviolet image was taken on 28 January 2004 by Hubble's Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The ACS was used on 22 March 2004 to take the visible-light image.

In 2001 Hubble made highly accurate measurements of the dip in the star’s light when the planet passed in front. The first detection of an atmosphere around an extrasolar planet was also made in this object. The presence of sodium as well as evaporating hydrogen, oxygen and carbon was detected in light filtered through the planet's atmosphere as it passed in front of the star. Measuring the chemical makeup of extra-solar planetary atmospheres will one day allow us to search for the markers of life beyond Earth. All living things breathe and this changes the composition of the atmosphere in readily detectable ways. Light- harvesting plants will impose their own colourful ‘biomarkers’ on the light reflected from planetary surfaces. Astronomers believe there are many planetary systems similar to ours orbiting other stars throughout the Galaxy. The birth, life, death and rebirth of stars continues in an unending cycle in which stars, born of gas and dust, will shine for millions or billions of years, die and return as gas and dust to form new stars.

Some are more massive – living relatively brief and spectacularly brilliant lives; some are less so and can live longer than the present age of the Universe. Stars are chemical factories, constructing the elements from which we and the Earth are made: most of the atoms in the newly-formed Universe were hydrogen and helium and the stars had to convert this raw material into what we need for life. Some short-lived phases of a star’s evolution have produced the most remarkably beautiful structures that Hubble has ever imaged.

A totally unexceptional star, just like billions of others that we can find throughout the Galaxy. A star is a sphere of glowing gas. It forms out of a cloud of gas compressed by gravity and releases energy steadily, throughout its life, because a chain of nuclear reactions is continuously taking place in its core. Most stars combine hydrogen atoms to form helium through the process called nuclear fusion; the same process that powers a devastating hydrogen bomb. In fact, stars are nuclear factories that convert lighter elements into heavier elements in a series of fusion reactions. They will keep glowing until they run out of ‘fuel’. And that’s it; a star’s life; a quiet beginning and a steady progress to a sometimes violent end. But how can we be certain of this picture when an individual star like the Sun outlives humans by a factor of a few hundred million? To investigate the lifecycle of a particular organism on Earth, we don’t have to track an individual specimen’s entire life. Instead, we can observe many of the organisms at once. This will show us all the different phases of its life cycle. For example, each stage of a person’s life is a snapshot of the human experience. And so it is with stars. Stars live and die over millions, or even billions, of years. Even the most reckless stars live for at least one million years; longer than the entire history of mankind! And this is why it is extremely unusual to be able to track age-related changes in individual stars. To learn more about stars, we must sample different stars at every stage of life and piece together the whole cycle from birth to death. Hubble’s vivid images have documented the tumultuous birth of stars and delivered many astonishing pictures documenting their evolution. The birth of stars in neighbouring stellar ‘maternity wards’ can be used as a time machine to replay the events that created our Solar System. Hubble has gone beyond what can be achieved with other observatories by linking together studies of the births, lives and deaths of individual stars with theories of stellar evolution. In particular, Hubble’s ability to probe individual stars in other galaxies enables scientists to investigate the influence of different environments on the lives of stars. These are crucial data that allow us to extend our understanding of the Milky Way to other galaxies. 41 Pillars of creation This image, taken with WFPC2 in 1995, has become a universally recognised icon.

Disks around young stars (also known as circumstellar or protoplanetary disks) are thought to be made up of 99% gas and 1% dust. Even that small amount of dust is enough to make the disks opaque and dark at visible wavelengths. These dark disks are seen here because they are silhouetted against the bright backdrop of the hot gas of the Orion nebula. Hubble has often had to work hard for this information because these important clues about our genesis lie hidden behind the veil of gently glowing, dust-laden molecular clouds where stars are formed. There are stars forming throughout the Universe. Enormous glowing pillars of dusty hydrogen gas stand sentinel over their cradles, basking in the light of nearby, newly- formed stars. Hubble’s ability to observe infrared light enables it to penetrate the dust and gas and reveal the newly born stars as never before. One of the most exciting of Hubble’s many discoveries was the observation of dust disks surrounding some newborn stars, buried deep inside the Orion Nebula. Here we are actually seeing the creation of new solar systems where planets will eventually form; just as they did in our own Solar System four and a half billion years ago. In the first stages of their lives, stars can stock up on gas from their original birth cloud. Material falling into the star creates bubbles or even jets as it is heated and blasted along a path that follows the star's rotation axis, like an axle through a wheel. Often many stars are born from the same cloud of gas and dust. Some may stay together through their whole lifetime, keeping step as they evolve, like the childhood friends that you keep for life. 45 Important clues about our genesis lie hidden behind the veil of gently glowing, dust-laden molecular clouds Mark McCaughrean (Max-Planck-Institute for Astronomy), C.

From the ground it is usually not possible to see this kind of evolution taking place over such short periods. In the Universe, this sort of action normally takes place on timescales of many thousands or even millions of years, so being able to follow real time changes in astronomical objects is a considerable asset. At the other extreme of the stellar life cycle, Hubble has monitored Supernova 1987A since 1991, four years after it exploded. The result is a series of stunning observations that show the evolution following the violent explosion witnessed nearly two decades ago. The regular monitoring of an even older supernova remnant, the Crab Nebula, has enabled Hubble to capture the display of matter and antimatter particles propelled close to lightspeed by the Crab pulsar, a rapidly rotating neutron star. Thanks to Hubble, scientists can directly follow the motion of the gas remnant left behind by the super- nova explosion witnessed by Chinese astronomers in 1054. Not all elderly stars end their lives as supernovae and Hubble has followed the final stages of their lives, with their very different outcomes. One such elderly star V838 Monocerotis, located about 20,000 light-years from Earth put out a brief flash of energy that illuminated the surrounding dust. The progress of the light echo across the dust was captured by Hubble in a film-like sequence of unprecedented clarity. The stars containing the most mass end their lives cataclysmically, destroying them- selves in titanic stellar explosions known as supernovae. For a few glorious months, each becomes one of the brightest objects in the entire Universe, outshining all the other stars in its parent galaxy.

The telescope has been monitoring a ring of gas surrounding the supernova blast. Hubble has observed the appearance of bright spots along the ring, like gemstones on a necklace. These cosmic ‘pearls’ are now being lit by supersonic shocks unleashed during the explosion of the star. The ruins of an exploding star can hide a powerful engine. Hubble has probed the mysterious heart of the Crab Nebula, the tattered remains of an exploding star, vividly described by Chinese astronomers in 1054, and has revealed its dynamic centre.

The centre collapses in on itself and the heavier elements are burnt, causing the outer layers to expand and leak slowly into space. At this stage in a star’s life, it is called a \"red giant\". Our Sun will become a \"red giant\" in a few billion years. At that time, it will expand so much that it will swallow Mercury, Venus and our planet as well. But these stars are not finished quite yet. They can still evolve into something extraordi- nary. Just before they breathe their last breath, stars like our Sun go out in a final blaze of glory. In its final stages of nuclear fusion, stellar winds blow from the star, causing the rem- nants of the red giant to swell to an enormous size.

Since these amazing constructions looked a bit like the newly discovered planet Uranus to early telescopic astronomers, they became known as planetary nebulae. From telescopes on Earth they look like round (planet-shaped) objects with fairly simple geometries. Hubble's keen perception shows that each planetary nebula is a distinct individual.

Whatever their cause, in only ten thousand years these fleeting cosmic flowers disperse in space. Just as real flowers fertilize their surroundings as they decompose, the chemi- cal elements produced inside the star during its life are dispersed by the planetary nebula to nourish the space around it, providing the raw material for new generations of stars, planets and possibly even life.

This is because our life spans are nothing but brief drops in the universal ocean of time. In fact, the Universe is in constant motion, but we would need to watch for vastly longer than a lifetime to perceive that motion in the night sky. Given enough time, we would see stars and galaxies move. Stars orbit the centre of the Milky Way and galaxies are pulled together by each other’s gravity. Sometimes they even collide. Hubble has observed numerous galaxies crashing together. Hubble's beautiful images of galaxies excite us for many reasons. The whirlpool forms, pastel colours of stellar and nebular light and dark contrasting dust lanes are aestheti- cally pleasing, but the immense scale in space and time that these vast islands of stars represent also leaves us awestruck. The intricate patterns in spiral galaxies and espe- cially those systems of galaxies that are apparently interacting evoke a complex dynamic Universe. Hubble's pictures alas are just snapshots capturing a single moment in a slow evolution that lasts much longer than our puny human lifetimes. What do the colours of the galaxies mean? Most of the Hubble galaxy images in this book are constructed to represent approximately ‘true’ colour. Most of the light is coming from shining stars. The relatively rare massive stars are hot and blue and so bright that, in spite of their relatively small numbers, they contribute a substantial part of the total light. These massive stars are short- lived and are found in stellar nurseries shrouded in gas and dust. The ultraviolet light from them excites the gas and makes it glow brightly in several discrete colours, most notably the red of hydrogen and the green of oxygen. Less massive — and more numerous — stars shine with pastel shades from blue-white to orange-red, depending on their temperature, which in turn depends on their mass. The palette is completed by the effects of dust. Light shining through the clouds of dust is dimmed and reddened, a little like the setting sun. We generally see this as a rather dirty brown tint associated particularly with the stellar nurseries.

Most of the stars in the galaxies will pass unharmed through the collision. The chance of two stars actually colliding is miniscule, so vast are the distances between them. At worst, gravity will fling them out, along with dust and gas to create long streamers that stretch a hundred thousand light-years or more. The two galaxies, trapped in their deadly gravitational embrace, will continue to orbit each other, ripping out more gas and stars to add to the tails. Eventually, hundreds of millions of years afterwards, the two galaxies will settle into a single, combined galaxy. It is believed that many present-day galaxies, including the Milky Way, were assembled from such a coalescence of smaller galaxies, occurring over billions of years.

Matter pours into a vast black hole at a galactic core and this accretion results in a brightness that far exceeds the sum of all the hundreds of billions of individual stars that constitute the host galaxy.

Black holes lurk at the centres of active galaxies in environments not unlike those found in violent tornadoes on Earth. Just as in a tornado, where debris is found spinning about the vortex, so, in a black hole, a dust torus surrounds its waist. In some cases astronomers can look along the axis of the dust torus from above or below and have a clear view of the black hole. Technically these objects are then called 'type 1 sources'.

X-ray satellites had hinted that black holes existed by detecting the emission of X-rays from superheated gas as it was consumed by the black hole. Then, along came Hubble: its high resolution made it possible to see the gravitational effects on matter surrounding the largest black holes in the Universe. Hubble has also shown that a black hole is most likely to be present at the centres of most galaxies. This has important implications for theories of galaxy formation and evolution since it implies that the black hole could be the ‘seed’ that triggers a galaxy’s formation. Black holes are the enigmatic villains of the Universe: swallowing all that comes their way and allowing nothing to escape from within their gravitational stronghold. There is no way to find out what is in there. Not even light can escape. So how do we know that they are even there? Black holes themselves cannot be observed directly. However, astronomers can study the indirect effects of black holes because the one thing they have in abundance is gravity. Astronomers believe that black holes are singularities simple points in space. No volume, no extension, but infinitely dense, black holes can be created during the final collapse of a massive star, many times the size of the Sun. The stellar corpse left over from the demise and collapse of a massive star can be so heavy that no force in nature can keep it from crumpling under its own weight into an infinitely small volume. Although the matter has apparently disappeared, having been compacted into nothingness, it still exerts a powerful gravitational pull and stars and other objects that come too close can be pulled in. For any black hole there is a point of no-return, called the “event horizon”. Once some- thing a nearby star say is pulled in past this point it will never be seen again. On its way towards the event horizon, the doomed star will begin to follow a fatal, spiralling orbit. As the star approaches the black hole still further, the matter closest to the hole feels a greater attraction than the rest of the star, sucking and stretching the star out towards the hole until the immense tidal forces pull it to pieces and devour it. There are quirkier aspects to these objects too, a twisting of space and time that warps and slows even the passage of time. All objects with a mass deform the very fabric of space and time, but black holes do this to an extreme degree. – –– There is no way to find out what is in there. Not even light can escape.

Perhaps the most curious objects astronomers have hypothesized about are wormholes. A wormhole is essentially a ‘shortcut’ through spacetime from one point in the Universe to another point in the Universe. Maybe wormholes, if they exist, will some day allow travel between regions in space faster than it would take light to make the journey through normal space. Hubble’s high resolution has revealed the dramatic distorting effects of black holes on their surroundings. Hubble has shown that black holes are most likely to be present at the centre of most galaxies. There is one at the centre of our Milky Way a giant, super- massive black hole, perhaps a million times bigger than those created from the collapse of massive stars. It may have shone much more brightly in the past, making the Galaxy appear very active. This may happen again in the future: we know that such objects can wax and wane over thousands or millions of years. Our black hole could be the result of the merger of many star-sized black holes that were formed during the remote history of the galaxy. When two galaxies collide, the black holes at each of their centres will perform an elaborate dance. Long after the two galaxies have merged into one, their central black holes continue to orbit each other for hundreds of millions of years before their final violent merger into a single, weighty black hole.

This means that, from some directions, the quasar is hidden from our direct view and we see the results of its prodigious energy production only indirectly. It took several decades for astronomers to realise that these heavily obscured galactic nuclei and the brilliant quasars were actually similar objects viewed from their ‘equators’ or from their ‘poles’. However, compared with the millions of years it takes for galaxies to merge, the final cataclysm at the cores would be relatively brief. So the odds of seeing such an event are small. Until as recently as 50 years ago, astronomers thought the Universe was a mostly peaceful place. But we now know that this is far from reality. Space is often shaken by violent events: cataclysmic explosions of supernovae, collisions of whole galaxies and the tremendous outpouring of energy due to the large amount of matter crashing into black holes. The discovery of quasars gave us the first clear glimpse of this turmoil. To groundbased telescopes, quasars look like normal stars. And that is exactly what astronomers first thought they were, naming them “Quasi stellar” objects. However, quasars are in fact much brighter and further away than stars. They can shine more brightly than 1,000 normal galaxies and are powered by supermassive black holes. Hubble has now observed several quasars and found that each resides at the centre of a galaxy. Today most scientists believe that all quasars are powered by a central, supermassive black hole that may weigh as much as a few billion Solar masses. Stars that orbit too close are pulled apart, draining into the quasar like water into an enormous cosmic plug-hole. The spiralling gas forms a thick disk, heated to a high temperature by its free-fall motion towards the black hole. The gas blasts its energy into space above and below the disk in colossal jets. Quasars are found in a wide range of galaxies, many of which are violently colliding. There appear to be a variety of mechanisms for igniting quasars.

A serendipi- tous discovery is something you find while you’re looking for something else. Such discoveries have often changed the course of astronomy. Gamma Ray Bursts were discovered serendipitously in the late 1960s by US military satellites that were on the lookout for Soviet nuclear tests. Instead of finding the most powerful detonations produced by humans, some of the most powerful blasts in the Universe itself were spotted. These astoundingly energetic blasts of gamma rays are detected at least once per day from random directions in the sky. Although Gamma Ray Bursts last only a few seconds, the energy they release is equal to the amount of energy radiated by our whole Milky Way over a couple of centuries. Gamma rays are not visible to the human eye, and special instrumentation is needed to detect them. For 30 years, no one knew what caused these bursts. It was like seeing the gamma-ray bullet fly by Earth without ever glimpsing the weapon that fired it. Together with nearly all other telescopes in the world Hubble looked for the ‘smoking gun’ for many years. It observed the positions in the sky where gamma ray explosions had been seen, trying to find any object at that location. But all efforts were in vain, until, in 1999, Hubble observations were fundamental in determining that these monstrous outbursts take place in far distant galaxies. After Hubble’s observations of the atypical supernova SN1998bw and the Gamma Ray Burst GRB 980425, scientists began to see a physical association between these two phenomena. The cause could be the blast produced in the final cataclysmic collapse of a massive star or the dramatic encounter of two very dense objects, such as two black holes, or a black hole and a neutron star. Black holes are certainly some of the most exotic objects in the Universe. As well as affecting matter they can also show up in some other spectacular ways because their enormous gravitational fields can also deflect light. In fact, rays of light that pass close to a black hole will not follow straight lines, but will be bent onto new paths, creating a natural telescope that can peer further into space than ever thought possible.

He would have been delighted – and staggered – to see the stunningly beautiful images taken by Hubble of clusters of galaxies: the largest aggregations of mass in the Universe.

Sometimes, these gravitational lenses act as telescopes that amplify the feeble radiation from objects beyond the limit of normal detection, rendering visible the most distant objects ever detected in the young Universe. Gravitational lensing in Abell 1689 Light does not always travel in straight lines.

Those that we see with a modern telescope such as the Hubble Space Telescope do not arise from warm air, but instead from remote clusters of galaxies huge concentrations of matter. Long ago some people thought the Earth was flat. This is in some way understandable since in our daily life we can’t see the curvature of our planet. Space itself is actually curved, although we can’t see this for ourselves on a starry night. But the curvature of space does create phenomena that we can observe. One of Albert Einstein's predictions is that gravity warps space and therefore distorts rays of light, in the same way that ripples on a pond create a warped honeycomb pattern of light on the sandy bottom. Light from distant galaxies is distorted and magnified by the gravitational field of massive galaxy clusters on its path to Earth. The effect is like looking through a giant magnifying glass and the result is called gravitational lensing. The weird patterns that rays of light create when they encounter a weighty object depend on the nature of the ‘lensing body’. Thus, the background object can appear in several guises. Though Einstein realized in 1915 that this effect would happen in space, he thought it could never be observed from Earth. However, in 1919 his calculations were indeed proved to be correct. During a solar eclipse expedition to Principe Island near the west coast of Africa, led by the renowned British astronomer Arthur Eddington, the positions of stars around the obscured solar disk were observed. It was found that the stars had moved a small but measurable distance outwards on the sky compared with when the Sun was not in the vicinity. Nowadays, faint gravitational images of objects in the distant Universe are observed with the best telescopes on Earth and, of course, with the sharp-sighted Hubble. Hubble’s sensitivity and high resolution allow it to observe numerous faint and distant gravitational lenses that cannot be detected with ground-based telescopes due to the blurring introduced by the Earth's atmosphere. The gravitational lensing results in multiple images of the original galaxy, many with a characteristically distorted, banana- like shape.

Gravitational lenses have mainly been observed around clusters of galaxies - collections of hundreds or thousands of galaxies. They are thought to be the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. Astronomers know that the matter we see in the Universe is just a tiny percentage of the total mass that must be there. For matter exerts a gravitational force, and the visible material is simply not enough to hold galaxies and clusters of galaxies together. Since the amount of warping of the ‘banana’-shaped images depends on the total mass of the lens, gravitational lensing can be used to ‘weigh’ clusters and to understand the distribution of the hidden dark matter. On clear images from Hubble one can usually associate the different arcs coming from the same background galaxy by eye. This process allows astronomers to study the details of galaxies in the young Universe and too far away to be seen with the present technology and telescopes.

It can then be re-pointed to look during the next few hours at old stars in a nearby galaxy that were formed billions of years ago – at the very same time as the young galaxies it had just been observing were emitting their light.

This means that it takes a while for rays of light to travel between two points in space. The speed of light through space is about 300,000 kilometres per second. 300,000 kilometres is nearly the distance from the Earth to the Moon. So it takes light just over a second to travel from the Moon to the Earth. When we look at the Moon we see it as it was just over a second ago. Who hasn’t thought about what it would be like to travel in time? The finite speed of light enables us to do the next best thing by allowing us to look back in time. When looking out into space, we just need to wait for the light from distant places to reach us, and it shows us how things were when the light began its journey. Powerful instruments, like Hubble, have made it possible to look farther out and farther back than ever before. What cosmologists are seeing is simply astounding. In the 1920s, astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered that most galaxies appear to be moving away from us at a rate proportional to their distance. The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it appears to be moving away from us. This is due to the expansion of the Universe. That expansion began in a titanic explosion, called the Big Bang, many billions of years ago. The rate of expansion holds the key to estimating the age and size of the Universe. This rate is called the Hubble constant. The age and size of the Universe can be estimated by 'running the expansion back- wards' — until everything is compressed into that infinitely small point of energy from which the Universe was generated. The top ranked scientific justification for building Hubble was to determine the size and age of the Universe. The quest to determine the Hubble constant precisely was headed by the Key Project team, a group of astronomers who used Hubble to look for remote, accurate ‘milepost markers’, a special class of stars called Cepheid variables. Cepheids have very stable and predictable brightness variations. The period of these variations depends strictly on the physical properties of the star, which can be used to determine their distance very effectively. For this reason these stars are known as ‘standard candles’. The Cepheids have been used as reliable stepping-stones to make distance measurements to supernovae, which are much brighter than Cepheids and so can be seen at far greater distances. Due to its high resolution, Hubble has measured the light from supernova explosions more accurately than any other instrument. From the ground an image of a supernova usually blends in with the image of its host galaxy. Hubble can clearly distinguish the light from the two sources.

Today we know the age of the Universe to a much higher precision than ever before: around 14 billion years. With Hubble the rate of expansion of the Universe, known to astronomers as the “Hubble Constant”, was determined. After eight years of Cepheid observations, this work was concluded by finding that the apparent speed of recession in all directions increases by 70 km/second for every 3.26 million light-years you look further out into space. For many years astronomers have discussed whether the expansion of the Universe would stop in some distant future, making the Universe collapse in a fiery \"Big Crunch\", or whether it would continue to expand ever more slowly. Combined observations of distant supernovae with Hubble and most of the world’s top-class telescopes were used to measure distances to remote supernovae. And it looks like the expansion of our Universe is nowhere near slowing down. Instead, it seems to be speeding up. When Hubble was used to measure how the expansion of the Universe has changed with time, it turned out, quite surprisingly, that during the first half of cosmic history, the expansion rate was actually slowing down. Then, a mysterious force, a sort of ‘anti- gravity’ made the Universe ‘hit the accelerator’ starting the acceleration we see today. This suggests an extraordinary fate for the Universe because it implies that the anti- gravity force is getting stronger all the time. If this continues, it will eventually over- whelm all gravity and catapult the Universe into a super fast acceleration that will shred everything into its constituent atoms.

Hubble started a new era we could call ‘astroarcheology’ and it began over Christmas, 1995. Pointing the world’s most sophisticated telescope at the same piece of sky for ten days in a row may sound a bit strange. And this was what many astronomers thought when they tried it for the first time at the end of 1995. Deep field observations are very long exposures pointing at a particular region of the sky. They aim to reveal faint objects by collecting as much light as possible over a long period of time. The ‘deeper’ an observation goes, the fainter the objects that become visible are. Objects in the sky can either look faint because their intrinsic brightness is low, or because their distance is great. When this experiment was first proposed, nobody really knew if this would lead to any interesting scientific results. But when they examined the first image astronomers were astonished! More than 3000 galaxies could be counted in this small field. The thousands of galaxies observed in the first Deep Field were at various stages of evolution and were strung out along a corridor billions of light-years long. This allowed the study of the evolution of these objects through time, glimpsing different galaxies at different stages of their lives. The observed region of sky in Ursa Major, the Plough, was carefully selected to be as empty as possible so that Hubble would look far beyond the stars of our own Milky Way and out past nearby galaxies. Deep Fields Deep fields result from lengthy observations of a particular region of the sky. They are intended to reveal faint objects by collecting their light for an appropriately long time. The ‘deeper’ the observation (i.e. the longer the exposure time), the fainter the objects that become visible are. Astronomical objects can either look faint because their natural brightness is feeble, or because they are very distant. In making a ‘deep field’ observation, the telescope is not simply pointed in exactly the same direction with the shutter open for days or weeks. It will actually take many separate observations with the telescope moved a very small amount between each. This is called ‘dithering’ and, when the dithered exposures are combined, the resulting image is free from many of the small defects that would appear in a single pointing. By taking many exposures, it is also possible to identify and remove nearly all of the ‘false stars’ created when the many energetic particles found in space collide with the detector and leave trails of exposed pixels.

Some of the most interesting results in astronomy emerged from this fruitful synergy between instruments of different sizes, in different environments and with sensitivity to different wavelengths. They gave us the first clear picture of the rate of star formation throughout the Universe. It showed that star formation peaked during the first half of the Universe’s life. At that time, over ten times more stars were forming than today. This was also the epoch when quasars were hundreds of times more common than they are now. Once they had begun to discover the most distant Universe ever seen, Hubble astrono- mers tried to push their observations even farther back in time. In 2003 and 2004, Hubble performed its deepest exposure ever: the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. It is a 28 day- long exposure, going much deeper than the earlier Hubble Deep Fields North and South. 99 NASA, ESA, and S.

Just after the Big Bang, in the newborn fast-expanding Univers before the era of the stars and galaxies the distribution of matter was fairly smooth. As time went on, the king of all forces gravity started acting. Slowly, but steadily. Under the influence of gravity from the mysterious dark matter, small clumps of normal matter started to coalesce in regions where the density was slightly higher than average. With no stars to light up space, the Universe was in its dark age. Where the density of the clumps became higher, even more matter was attracted, and a competi- tion between the expansion of space and gravity took place. Where gravity won, regions stopped expanding, and started to collapse in on themselves. The first stars and galaxies were born. Where the matter density was highest at the intersections between the large web-like structures of matter the largest structures we know were formed: clusters of galaxies. The Deep Field images are studded with a wide range of galaxies of various sizes, shapes, and colours. Astronomers will spend years studying the myriad shapes and colours of the galaxies in this image to understand how they formed and have evolved since the Big Bang. In vibrant contrast to the image's rich harvest of classic spiral and elliptical galaxies, there is also a zoo of oddball galaxies littering the field. Some look like toothpicks; others like links on a bracelet. A few appear to be interacting with each other. Their strange shapes are a far cry from the majestic spiral and elliptical galaxies we see around us today. These oddball galaxies chronicle a period when the Universe was more chaotic, when order and structure were just beginning to emerge and galaxies were being assembled from smaller pieces. One of the great things about Hubble is that there are many instruments onboard that can make different observations at the same time. The Hubble Ultra Deep Field is actually two separate images taken by two instruments: Hubble's ACS camera and the NICMOS instrument. NICMOS can see even farther than the ACS. It detects infrared light, and so it is able to reveal the farthest galaxies ever seen because the expanding Universe has stretched and weakened the light from these objects so much that, they are now only visible at infrared wavelengths. – – – –– – – Perhaps Hubble’s greatest legacy has been to open our eyes to the incredible beauty of nature – not only ‘out there’ in the depths of cosmos, but also everywhere around us in our daily lives..."},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"103 The Hubble Ultra Deep Field is likely to remain the deepest image of the Universe for the next decade or so, until an ESA Ariane rocket launches the James Webb Space Telescope in 2011.

This is yet another example of how Hubble's sharp eye reveals surprising details in celestial objects. The Nebula is one of the Universe's peculiar places. In 1995, using the 15-metre Swedish ESO Submillimetre Telescope in Chile, astronomers revealed that it is the coldest place in the Universe found so far. With a temperature of -272°C, it is only 1 degree warmer than absolute zero (the lowest limit for all temperatures). Even the -270°C background glow from the Big Bang is warmer than this nebula. It is the only object found so far that has a temperature lower than the background radiation. This Hubble image was taken in 1998. It shows faint arcs and ghostly filaments embedded within the diffuse gas of the nebula's smooth 'bow tie' lobes. The diffuse bow-tie shape of this nebula makes it quite different from other observed planetary nebulae, which normally have lobes that look more like 'bubbles' blown in the gas. However, the Boomerang Nebula is so young that it may not have had time to develop these structures. Why planetary nebulae have so many different shapes is still a mystery.
