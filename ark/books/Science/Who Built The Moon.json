This is a perfectlyreasonable response based on everything that we know about the world we live in,where there are just two kinds of objects: those that are here because therandom forces of the Universe – that we call ‘nature’ – caused them to exist; orbecause they were manufactured by human hand.However super-rational our scientific community considers itself to be, thereare still huge numbers of people who believe things that are not proven byempiric means. In a recent poll it was found that no less than ninety-two percent of Americans say they believe in God1 – and other surveys indicate thatmany millions of people are equally convinced that aliens have visited ourplanet.God may well exist, and so too might aliens for all we know, but this book willonly concern itself with hard, scientific facts. And, unlike so many of thosetrapped in the politically correct world of academia, our published findingswill not be constrained by the demands of current convention. The information weput forward here is clear, testable and, we believe, irrefutable.Despite the fact that the Moon is almost certainly 4.6 billion years old, wewill demonstrate beyond all reasonable doubt that Earth’s Moon cannot be anatural object. And then we shall explain in detail how the agency thatmanufactured the Moon left a series of detailed messages of what had been doneand for whom it had been undertaken.So, here is our challenge. Put aside your natural incredulity and read this bookwith an open mind, check out the evidence then ask yourself ‘Who built theMoon?’We have cited three possibilities but maybe you can think of more. However, thelast of our suggestions appears to us to be increasingly likely. It is aworrying, staggering, exciting and completely awesome concept. And, if there iseven an outside chance that this could be the answer, the world has a major newchallenge ahead of it."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONETHE DAWN OF AWARENESSThe entire population appeared to have simultaneously decided to evacuate everybuilding, and the streets and car parks were quickly filling with peoplestanding almost shoulder-to-shoulder. Traffic began to grind to a halt asdrivers leaned out of their windows, and even the birds abandoned the sky toassemble in rows along guttering and telephone wires, chattering like somemisplaced dawn chorus.The large grey clouds obligingly parted to reveal a muted late- morning Sun thathad a small bite out of its right-hand edge. As the dark spot grew, the birdsfell silent and a sea of expectant faces became transfixed upwards. Threewelders from a nearby garage became instantly popular as they passed aroundtheir dark-lensed masks, allowing the smiling onlookers a direct view of thediminishing solar disc.Then it happened; the moment of totality arrived. The Sun disappeared forseveral seconds, allowing the darkness of night to wholly consume the day. Thenslowly a bright sparkle materialized that soon looked like a diamond set on theband of some heavenly ring.The last total solar eclipse of the twentieth century had just occurred on themorning of August 11th 1999. It had begun when the Moon passed between the Earthand Sun, throwing an umbral shadow, forty-nine kilometres wide, on the NorthAtlantic just south of Nova Scotia. The inky black circle then swept across theocean surface until it passed over the Isles of Scilly, off the south-west coastof England, some forty minutes later. Here the path width had expanded to 103kilometres and was now covering the ground at a speed approaching 1,000 metresper second. The circular shadow then curved its way over Europe and on to theMiddle East before crossing India and finally disappearing over the Bay ofBengal.Such events do not happen often in the lifetime of an individual but once seen,a total solar eclipse is never forgotten. Solar eclipses occur around two tofive times per year but the area on the ground covered by the totality is verysmall, so in any given location on Earth a total eclipse will only happen onceevery 360 years.One can only imagine how primitive peoples may have feared for their lives asthe Sun was apparently extinguished before their eyes. No doubt the astronomerpriests of ancient time held sway over their people by having the apparentlymagical power of predicting such terrifying events.But even today the magic and mystery of the eclipse is very real.It is a very strange quirk of fate indeed that the disc of the Moon should seem,from an earthly perspective, to be exactly the same size as the Sun. Whilst wecasually take it for granted that the two main bodies seen in Earth’s skies lookthe same size, it is actually something of a miracle. Most people are fullyaware that the Moon is tiny compared to the Sun but that it is much closer to uscausing them to appear as equal discs. To be precise, the Moon is 400 timessmaller than the star at the centre of our solar system, yet it is also just1/400th of the distance between the Earth and the Sun.Whilst the surprisingly neat number of 400 for relative size and distance isapparently an amusing coincidence of the decimal counting system, the oddsagainst this optical illusion happening at all are huge. Experts are deeplypuzzled by the phenomenon. Isaac Asimov, the respected scientist andscience-fiction guru, described this perfect visual alignment as being ‘the mostunlikely coincidence imaginable’.This perfect fit of the lunar and solar discs is a very human perspectivebecause it only works from the viewpoint of someone standing on the Earth’ssurface. But the magic of the Moon’s movements above our heads goes to even moreastonishing levels. By some absolutely incomprehensible quirk of nature, theMoon also manages to precisely imitate the perceived annual movements of the Suneach month.So, when the Sun is at its lowest and weakest in midwinter, the full Moon is atits highest and brightest, and in midsummer, when the Sun is at its highest andbrightest, the Moon is at its weakest.If you want to understand how extraordinary this doppelgänger effect is, standon a hilltop or an open plain and film the Sun at midwinter sunset (its mostsoutherly point on the horizon), at the spring equinox, again at midsummer andagain at the autumn equinox. Then on those same dates film the Moon setting andyou will see that they both go down at the same point on the horizon at theequinoxes (March 21st and September 21st) but the Moon will have the oppositesetting point to the Sun at solstices in December and June. 2Figure_1.tif [../Images/00006.jpeg]Figure 1This drawing shows the peculiar relationship of the Sun and Moon throughout theyear as seen from Earth. At midsummer in the northern hemisphere the Sun setsnorth of west, whereas the full Moon sets south of west. At midwinter thesituation is reversed, with the Sun setting south of west and the Moon settingnorth of west.Figure_2.tif [../Images/00007.jpeg]Figure 2At the time of the spring and autumn equinox sunset happens at a due westposition, whilst the full Moon also sets in this part of the sky.It would be easy to dismiss these Sun-mimicking performances by saying that itis simply a consequence of the Moon’s distance from Earth and its orbitalcharacteristics. And that is what most scientifically trained people will saybecause it is self-evidently true. But what they are really saying is ‘It is sobecause it is so’ – which takes us nowhere. Of course, it could, and logicallyhas to be, one big coincidence. What else could it be? Even most of theninety-two per cent of the American population who state that they believe inGod would probably assume coincidence and only a minority might claim that it isthe grand plan of the Almighty.The Moon’s dance around the Earth that produces these startling performances isextremely complex and it is a consequence of the relative movements of the Earthand the Sun as well of the Moon itself.The path of the Moon’s orbit is inclined at 5°9´ to the line of Earth’s patharound the Sun, known as the plane of the ecliptic. The Earth is also tilted atan angle of just over 23°27´, although this is slowly decreasing so that inseveral million years it will reach 22°54´, after which it will again increase.Figure_3.tif [../Images/00008.jpeg]Figure 3It follows that solar eclipses can only occur when the Moon passes through theplane of the ecliptic and the Sun’s light is blocked by the Moon. These pointsof intersection happen twice for each lunar orbit and are known as ‘nodes’.These nodes appear to move slowly around the background stars giving theimpression of moving backwards through the calendar occurring 19.618 daysearlier per year. The cycle completes every 18.618 years, which amounts to asurprisingly neat 6,800 days.Closely allied to this node cycle is the so-called ‘Saros cycle’, which governsthe periodicity and recurrence of eclipses, where each eclipse sequence has aduration of approximately 6,585.32 days (eighteen years, eleven days, sevenhours, forty minutes and forty-eight seconds). The people of Ancient Mesopotamiaknew of this astronomical principle and it is quite possible that earlierobservers, long before written records began, were also aware of it.However, one has to wait for three Saros cycles in order for a solar eclipse torepeat at the same spot on Earth because successive eclipses in the Saros cyclehappen one-third of the way around the world from each other. You wouldtherefore have to wait over fifty-four years to see an eclipse return to thesame geographic area. There are twelve different Grand Saros eclipse series atthe present time.Human knowledge about the movements of the Moon is far older than most peoplemight imagine. More than 25,000 years ago an early astronomer created a lunarcalendar that is still intact. The bone he engraved was excavated nearly ahundred years ago at Abri Blanchard, not far from Lascaux in France. Expertsagree that the markings accurately correspond with a two-month lunar calendar.Around 250 generations later another astronomer also recorded this alreadyancient knowledge, using various natural minerals daubed onto a cave wall toleave the image of an empty rectangle followed by a series of fourteen sootydots. It was realized that these marks might also be a lunar calendar. Thefourteen dots, it was argued, represented the face of the Moon from full to new,after which the empty rectangle would symbolize the disappearance of the Moon’sface on the fifteenth day.If anyone doubted that the marks on the cave walls at Lascaux really was a lunarcalendar, or even continued to believe counting was something that did notappear until the arrival of the written word some 5,000 years ago, anotherpicture close by might cause them to think again. On this part of the cave wallthere were twenty-nine dots, snaking around the bottom of a beautifully executedpainting of a wild horse. Twenty-nine days is the period from new Moon throughfull Moon to new Moon again. And yet another artefact known as the IsturitzBaton, displays an even more advanced four-month and five- month lunar calendar.It is humbling to realize that these records were created more than ten thousandyears before the Ice Age ended and the woolly mammoth disappeared.These kinds of lunar observations are not restricted to southern France. TheIshango Bone, which was found in the Congo, Africa, also carries markings thatseem to represent a lunar calendar. What is more, it is of an almost identicalage to the Isturitz Baton, though it originated many hundreds of kilometres tothe south and on a different continent.The existence of lunar calendars from such an early date is of great importanceto our understanding of our own development. They demonstrate a clear awarenessof the passing of time and the cycles of the natural world. The discovery of anarchaeological artefact is a matter of chance and is dependent on the number ofobjects of any particular sort that once existed. The fact that so many of thesebones, antlers and paintings have been discovered is a good indication that theywere not unique and that Moon knowledge was important to the Palaeolithic peopleof Europe and Africa, though this does give us cause to wonder why such an earlylunar fascination developed.A recent discovery has shown why such intricate observations ‘suddenly’ becamepossible for our distant forebears around 32,000 years ago. In July 2004, RachelCaspari of the University of Michigan and Sang-Hee Lee of the University ofCalifornia published a paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy ofSciences, concerning comparisons of 768 different human fossils from a huge spanof human development. They then divided the fossils into two groups – adults ofreproductive age, which they settled on as fifteen years, and adults that livedto be twice as old, based on tooth wear.In primitive societies, people were often grandparents by the age of thirty, ifthey were lucky enough to live that long.Dr Caspari said, ‘We found this proportion of older to young adults in thefossil record increased over time and in the Upper Paleolithic that proportionjust skyrocketed.’By calculating the ratio of old to young individuals in the samples, theresearchers found that their numbers soared up to fivefold in the UpperPalaeolithic group, a leap that was so surprising that the team at firstquestioned its own results.This dramatic leap in average lifespan allowed individuals to grow older andwiser and afforded each of these new elders time to pass on their knowledge tothe next generation of adults. The wear on the teeth suggests that this leap inlongevity must have given rise to a true form of education that could build up abody of ‘species intelligence’ where the entire social group knows far more thanany one individual. This would allow for the first specialization in whichtalented men and women were fed and protected by the group to allow them to addvalue to their early society.This sudden transition from a society of children to one of ‘greybeards’ musthave been a watershed that laid the foundations for what would eventually becometrue civilization. The period of history, known as the Upper PalaeolithicPeriod, marks a time when modern man was becoming established in Europe andthere was an expansion of population, creating social pressures that led to thegrowth of trade networks, increased mobility, and more complex systems ofco-operation and competition.We could now understand why observational astronomy became the first realscience for humankind. All science is based upon observation of patterns thatstand out from the ‘noise’ of simple random chance and then, throughunderstanding, we can make predictions of future events and outcomes. In thisway the tides, the seasons and the movements of the heavens could be seen asbeing parts of a single engine driving the variations in the immediateenvironment of the early thinkers.These early observational scientists would also note where patterns fromcompletely different events appeared to be related. Why should high tide happentwice a day and rise higher when the Moon was full or when there was no Moon atall? Did the Moon have some kind of control over something as massive as theoceans? Even stranger, why did women of childbearing age lose blood once forevery complete cycle of the Moon?We can be sure that this particular fact was not lost upon these people.Back in 1911 a French physician by the name of J G Lalanne was examining cavesin Laussel, in the Dordogne, when he chanced upon something that turns out to bevery illuminating in terms of the Palaeolithic mindset. Carved into the wall ofa limestone rock shelter, he found a 33cm female figure. The artistry involvedfrom so early a period is quite remarkable, the more so given that it wasexecuted with flint tools. The naked and full-bellied woman has her left hand onher abdomen and in her right hand is holding a bison horn, in the shape of acrescent moon. Upon the bison horn there are thirteen incised lines. The Venusof Laussel, as she is called, is at least 20,000 years old.This carving is one of many that strongly suggest there was a very earlyrecognition that human fertility seemed to be tied to the phases and period ofthe Moon. Human female reproduction is dependent on the menstrual cycle whichhas an average of twenty-eight days, and approximately halfway through the cyclea mature cell is released from a woman’s ovaries and becomes available forfertilization. If sexual intercourse does not take place and the egg is notfertilized, it disintegrates after a couple of days. At the end of the cycle, ifno conception has taken place, menstruation begins and the cycle commences onceagain.A series of intriguing studies by Professor LeRoy McDermott of the MissouriState University has suggested that these early ‘Venus’ images of the femalefigure were self-portraits. His analysis showed that the figurines were madefrom the point of view of ‘self’ rather than ‘other’ and they could onlyrepresent a women’s view of her own body both emotionally and physically as shelooks downwards. Using photographic simulations of what a modern female sees ofherself, McDermott demonstrates that the anatomical omissions and proportionaldistortions found in various Venus figurines occur naturally in autogenous, orself-generated, information. The size, shape, and articulation of the objectsappear to be determined by their relationship to the eyes and the relativeeffects of foreshortening, distance, and occlusion rather than by any symbolicdistortion. As self-portraits of women at different stages of life, McDermottbelieves these earliest representations of the human form embodied obstetric-aland gynaecological information and probably signified an advance in women’sself-conscious control over the material conditions of their reproductive lives.The lunar month symbolism in the Venus of Laussel strongly suggests that women20,000 years ago knew the length of their menstrual cycles and already equatedthem with the phases of the Moon. The thirteen lines on the crescent-shapedbison horn could easily relate to the thirteen menstrual cycles an average womancould expect in each year. At the same time, it is not at all uncommon for ahuman female to menstruate on the same Moon phase each month becausetwenty-eight days is merely an average, whilst the period between one full Moonand the next is 29.53 days.The historical connection between human fertility and the Moon even extends tothe word ‘menstrual’. It derives from the Latin mensis, meaning month, whilstthe word ‘month’ is very ancient and refers to the period of four weeks as beingone ‘moonth’.The connection between human fertility and the cycles of the Moon is consideredto be ‘apparent rather than actual’, but it isn’t in the least surprising thatthe possibility of a relationship was noticed by our ancient ancestors. Theclincher probably came when someone realized that the average gestation periodof a human female, from conception to birth, is around 266 days – or nine fulllunar synodic cycles.In a social and a religious sense, fertility undoubtedly played a crucial partin the lives of people at the time the Venus of Laussel was carved. It is moreor less universally accepted that female deities were important to human culturefor thousands of years of prehistory. Statues of pregnant women with exaggeratedgenitals and breasts are common from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic periodsand there are strong indications of the existence of a fertility-based deity whohas come down to us as ‘The Great Goddess’. The Venus of Laussel could quiteeasily be a representation of this deity, complete with a representation of theheavenly body with which she was equated – the Moon.About 6,000 years ago there was an outbreak of building in stone across thewestern parts of Europe, particularly in the British Isles, that tells us agreat deal about the Neolithic people’s fascination with the Moon.Dr Philip Stooke, of the University of Western Ontario, Canada had always beenpuzzled as to why there were no maps or drawings of the Moon older than the onedrawn by Leonardo da Vinci five hundred years ago. He decided to look at ancientmanuscripts and the records of excavations of the Neolithic sites on the BritishIsles. Amongst other sites, he looked at the truly amazing prehistoricstructures known as Newgrange and Knowth in County Meath, Ireland. And it was atthe recently excavated Knowth that he found a 5,200-year-old carving made up ofa set of lines and dots. Dr Stooke realized that this was not simply a Stone-Agedoodle but a drawing of the face of the Moon. He said:‘I was amazed when I saw it. Place the markings over a picture of the full Moonand you will see that they line up. It is without doubt a map of the Moon, themost ancient one ever found. It’s all there in the carving. You can see theoverall pattern of the lunar features, from features such as Mare Humorunthrough to Mare Crisium. The people who carved this Moon map were the firstscientists – they knew a great deal about the motion of the Moon. They were notprimitive at all.’Figure_4.tif [../Images/00009.jpeg]Figure 4These people were not merely Moon watchers. Chris, along with Robert Lomas, hadalready published his analysis of the astronomical function of nearby Newgrange,which was carefully designed and engineered to allow the light of Venus topenetrate deep into the domed structure once every eighth winter solstice.3 Thisfocused beam of light gave these early scientists a very precise tracking ofVenus, which allowed them to maintain a calendar that would be accurate to amatter of seconds over each eight-year cycle. There was no doubt that thesebuilders were far from primitive, as archaeological convention once suggested.Investigations at Knowth had already shown that at certain times moonlightshines down the eastern passage of the structure. Dr Stooke has now pointed outthat these narrow moonbeams would also fall right onto the Neolithic lunar map.He concluded, ‘It was obviously built by men who had a sophisticatedunderstanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon and stars.’The switch from a powerful female deity, often equated with the Moon, andsolar-based masculine deities seems to have taken place at about the same timehumanity began to discover writing. This occurred in Sumer (modern Iraq andKuwait) and Egypt just after structures like Newgrange and Knowth had beenconstructed.One researcher, Dr Leonard Shlain, Chief of Labroscopic Surgery at theCalifornia-Pacific Medical Center, has suggested this connection in hiscontroversial but immensely popular book, The Alphabet versus the Goddess.4 HereShlain outlines his view that the evolution of writing specifically involved theuse of the practical left hemisphere of the brain, as a direct contrast to themany thousands of years during which the more intuitive, inspirational righthemisphere had predominated. He maintains that this explains the virtualabandonment of a generally peaceful feminine-centred society across much ofEurope, the Middle East and Asia. This transition was staggered but it beganaround 3,000 BC, when a more aggressive, patriarchal social structure emergedwith masculine deities predominating.This thesis sounds very reasonable and, if true, we could expect to find thislegacy of the Moon-associated goddesses still present at the dawn of writing,when myths and stories were first being catalogued. And this is indeed the case.In Sumer we find Nana, a very early Moon goddess, whilst in nearby Egypt, wherewriting came just a little later, there is an even better example in terms ofIsis, who rose to become one of the most important and revered goddesses acrossthe whole known world for several thousand years. Isis originated as a Moongoddess, and the fact is borne out by one specific part of her story. Isis hadto rebuild the body of her husband, Osiris, after he had been brutally murderedand his body chopped into pieces. She travelled all over the world to find thedismembered parts of her husband of which there were fourteen in total. Thestory is analogous to the gradual increase in size of the Moon across fourteendays from new to full.Referring to the Egyptians, Plutarch, the Greek essayist, writing around 60 ADsaid:‘Egyptian priests called the Moon “the Mother of the Universe”, because theMoon, having the light which makes moist and pregnant, is promotive of thegeneration of living beings.’Although to some early cultures the Moon was associated with a masculine deity,such as the Babylonian Sin for example, in by far the majority of cases the Moonwas considered to be female and carried strong aspects of fertility. Thisgoddess had many names across the world. To the Greeks she was Artemis and theRomans called her Diana and Selene. Her Finnish name was Kuu and to the Celtsshe was worshipped as Cerridwen. Nor was she ignored in the New World; in whatis now Mexico the Moon goddess was called Tlazolteotli and to the Mayans she wasIxchup. These names represent only a tiny proportion of those that are stillremembered and there can be no doubt at all that Earth’s Moon has been deeplyimportant to humanity across the whole world and for many thousands of years.The Moon was almost certainly the first heavenly body used to measure thepassage of time for reasons other than human fertility. In this capacity it isstill enshrined in our own systems by the use of months to split the solar year.Looking back at history it is easy to see the repeated attempts of differentcultures to reconcile lunar time with a growing recognition of the length of theyear, which is governed by the Sun. A truly ancient culture, such as that of theSumerians, never abandoned its lunar calendar, beginning each month as the firstcrescent of the Moon showed itself in the dawn sky. However, at the same timeSumerian Priests adopted a ‘stylized’ month of thirty days in length, whichfitted the solar year in a more regular way. Lunar reckoning is still used inIslam, a legacy of the religion’s origins in the Arabian Peninsula.In a physical sense this intense interest in the Moon is not at all surprising.We tend to forget in our modern world of electric lights that there was a time,not so long ago, when the Moon was a welcome sight on a dark night, but at thesame time it was recognized to have awesome powers. It was believed by culturesfrom across the world that the Moon could have a bearing on people’s mentalstates (see chapter five). The English word ‘lunatic’ enshrines this belief and,up to very recent times, it was considered that those who were mentally unstablecould be triggered into madness and violence by the appearance of the full Moon.In addition, our ancient ancestors were well aware that the Moon was responsiblefor one of the most frightening and awe-inspiring happenings that periodically‘stole’ the Sun from the sky.Solar eclipses happen when the new Moon passes directly between the Sun and theEarth. At such times the shadow of the Moon is cast upon the Earth. If theobserver is in the right place on the Earth, it will appear that the light ofthe Sun has been blotted out and day can suddenly become night. A total eclipseis a truly remarkable event because in order for it to happen the size of theMoon and the Sun, as seen from the Earth, must be identical. Nevertheless itdoes happen and it must have struck absolute terror into the hearts of earlyhumans. This fear would have been slightly mitigated when it became possible topredict eclipses, something that a number of early cultures sought to do.A second sort of eclipse, which is seen more often because of the planetarygeometry involved, is called a ‘lunar eclipse’ – and in its own way this musthave been just as potent and frightening. A lunar eclipse happens when the Moonmoves through the shadow of the Earth, so the full Moon is seen to slowlydisappear in a clear night sky. (See figure 19, pg 246)On these occasions the Moon’s face is not totally blotted out by Earth’s shadow,often appearing as a ghostly blood red disc. Even today this is a chilling sightand one can sympathize with people who viewed the event with a sense offoreboding.Without a good understanding of the planetary cycles involved, eclipses of bothsorts could easily appear to be random events and many early cultures sought todiscover the patterns involved, probably working on the assumption thatunderstanding inferred a degree of control. This may well have represented thefirst serious attempts at astronomy. It is known that both the Assyrians and theBabylonians could predict eclipses. In both cases many of the astronomicalskills were inherited from the earlier Sumerians and it is highly likely thateclipse prediction already existed before 3,000 BC.Further west there have been suggestions that some Megalithic monuments werebuilt as eclipse predictors, maybe as early as 4,000 BC. Astronomer GeraldHawkins in his book Stonehenge Decoded used a computer model to demonstrate thatStonehenge in Wiltshire, England, might have been partly built with eclipseprediction in mind.5By at least the second millennium BC the Chinese could also predict eclipses. Asfar back as 2650 BC, Li Shu was writing about the subject of astronomy. Threeand a half centuries later, ancient Chinese astrologers had sophisticatedobservatory buildings, and solar eclipses were considered essential forforecasting the future health and successes of the emperor. These astronomerswere keen to be accurate as failure to get the prediction correct was likely tobe lethal for them. In one documented case referring to the eclipse of 2136 BCthe two astrologers who got it wrong were beheaded. The following recorded theirfate: ‘Here lie the bodies of Ho and Hi, Whose fate, though sad, is risible;Being slain because they could not spy Th’ eclipse which was invisible.’ –Author unknownFor thousands of years the Moon was a thing of awe and wonder to human beingsacross the entire planet and it remains so to millions of people today, despitetechnological advances and a good understanding of its physical characteristics.For example, the Moon has always been equated with agriculture. Even in someparts of the fully developed world there are farmers and gardeners who would notdream of either planting or harvesting without direct reference to the phase ofthe Moon or even the part of the zodiac it occupies at any particular point intime. The Moon is the fastest moving astronomical body when viewed from theEarth and appears to pass through all the zodiac signs in only 27.322 days.Generally speaking, crops were often planted close to the new Moon, so that theycould grow with the face of the Moon. Whilst there is no known scientific basisfor such ideas, the advice offered is often very specific and doesn’t vary muchacross the world. Nor does Moon-lore relate only to sowing seeds. For example,it is suggested that when picking apples for immediate eating, it is best toharvest them at the time of the full Moon, though if they are to be stored, thenew Moon is preferred, since the apples are believed to be less likely to rot.Even today the Moon has always been important to humanity and it is central toone of the most important festivals of the Christian religion. Easter, whichfalls in the early spring in the northern hemisphere, is an ancient celebrationof rebirth that long predates its association with the death and resurrection ofJesus Christ.The New Testament states that Jesus Christ was crucified on the eve of Passoverbefore rising again a short time later. In consequence, the ancient Easterfestival was reassigned to commemorate this miracle. There was, however,considerable debate over the date on which Easter should fall. The earlyChristians of Jewish origin celebrated the Resurrection immediately followingtheir Passover festival, which, according to their lunar calendar, fell on theevening of the full Moon. This was the fourteenth day in the month of Nisan (thefirst month of their year), thereby causing Easter to fall on different days ofthe week. The new breed of non-Jewish Christians from around the Roman Empirewished to commemorate the Resurrection on a Sunday – their newly definedSabbath. In 325 AD the Roman emperor Constantine I convened the Council ofNicaea to debate whether or not Jesus Christ was a man or a god. Havingofficially designated Jesus to be God, by a narrow margin, the council thenruled that the Easter festival should be celebrated on the first Sunday afterthe full Moon following the vernal equinox; and that if the full Moon shouldoccur on a Sunday and thereby coincide with the Passover festival, Easter shouldbe commemorated on the Sunday following.The origin of the word ‘Easter’ is thought to come from Eostre, the Anglo-Saxonname of a Teutonic goddess of spring and fertility. Her festival was celebratedon the day of the vernal equinox which now falls around March 21st when the Sunrises in the east and sets in the west, and the day has twelve hours of daylightand twelve hours of darkness. Traditions associated with this pagan festivalsurvive in the idea of the Easter rabbit, a symbol of fertility, and in brightlydecorated Easter eggs, which were a symbol of rebirth."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWOTHE SCIENCE OF THE ANCIENTS‘The important thing is not to stop questioning.Curiosity has its own reason forexisting.’Albert EinsteinIn the early 1930s a young Scottish engineer noticed that several of the widelyignored, prehistoric Megalithic sites near his home appeared to have lunaralignments. He decided to study some of the sites and he began a process ofcareful surveying that was eventually to lead him to make a discovery ofstaggering importance.As a young engineer at Glasgow University, Alexander Thom visited a number ofprehistoric stone structures near to his home in Scotland during the early1930s. He marvelled at the grandeur and admired the way so many of the giantstones had survived the weathering of more than 5,000 years, as well as provingresistant to the thieving tendencies of croft and road builders across dozens ofcenturies. As he contemplated the various sites he mused over their purpose andas he looked to the horizon he could imagine how the stones might have been usedas sighting stones for astronomical purposes. When he checked out the rising andsetting points of the Sun and the Moon across the year his hunch appeared to beborn out.His first survey was at a site known as Callanish, on the Isle of Lewis in theHebrides off the west coast of Scotland. This complex of standing stonesrevealed many astronomical alignments and is today often referred to as a ‘Moontemple’. Thom went on to spend nearly half a century carefully surveying theso-called Megalithic (the word means giant stones) structures that lay scatteredacross the countryside from the islands off northern Scotland down to the Frenchregion of Brittany. Along the way he became a highly respected professor ofEngineering at Oxford University until his retirement in 1961.Thom had quickly realized that these prehistoric builders were engineers likehimself and that they had a surprisingly sophisticated knowledge of geometry andastronomy. The approach taken by this talented engineer was to assess what hebelieved the site had been intended to do – and then redesign it himself. Hequickly gained an empathy with the Stone-Age builders that gave him a realinsight into the purpose of each site that would possibly be lost on aconventional archaeologist. Once he had a picture in his mind of what he thoughttheir plan had been, he went away to create his own solution to the assumedproblem. Having drawn up his own design he then returned to compare the sitelayout to his own blueprint. Through this process he could predict the locationof missing stones and, on further inspection, he would usually reveal the sockethole that confirmed his theory.Thom developed a new statistical technique to establish the relative positionsof the stones and, over time, something spectacularly unusual emerged from theamassed data. These prehistoric builders had not been lugging huge stoneswilly-nilly; they had manufactured these structures working with a standard unitof measurement across a huge area of thousands of square miles of what was thendense forest and barren moorland.It was amazing that these supposedly primitive people could have had an‘international’ convention for a unit of length, but the mystery deepens becauseThom was eventually able to describe the supreme accuracy of a unit he calledthe Megalithic Yard. This was no approximate measure taken from paces or bodyparts; it was equal to 2.722 feet +/- 0.002 feet (82.96656cm +/- 0.061cm). Thomwas also able to demonstrate that the unit was frequently used in its double andhalf form as well as being broken down into forty sub-units for use in designwork that he designated as ‘Megalithic Inches’.Most archaeologists refuted the finding on the basis that the idea that a unitof measurement that was more accurate than a modern measuring tape was absurd.Thom admitted that he could not suggest how it could have been achieved but hestood by his evidence that simply said it ‘had’ been done. In our previous book,Civilization One, we described how we set out to investigate the concept of theMegalithic Yard. Our initial hypothesis was that if the unit was not an error ofThom’s data analysis it logically should have two properties: 1. It should have an origin in something meaningful, rather than just being an abstraction that was adopted by everyone. 2. It should have a means of reproduction that could be used by anyone without reference to any sort of standard measuring rod, that would have been difficult to manufacture and impossible to keep accurate across centuries.We realized that our assumption could be wrong on either or both counts but asit turned out, we were correct on both. Thom had not made an error.As we describe in Civilization One, the Megalithic Yard is a geodetic unit, inthat it is integral (has a whole number relationship) to the polar circumferenceof the Earth. We found that these early Megalithic builders viewed a circle ashaving 366 degrees rather than the 360 degrees that we use today. We realizedthat there really should be 366 degrees in a circle for the very good reasonthat there are 366 rotations of the Earth in one orbit of the Sun – the mostfundamental of all circles in human existence.One solar orbit is, of course, a year but there is a very slight differencebetween the number of rotations of the planet and the 365 days in a year. Thisis because the mean solar day is based on the time between the Sun being at itszenith on two consecutive days (86,400 seconds) but an actual rotation or‘sidereal day’ takes 236 seconds less. All of those ‘saved’ seconds add up toexactly one more day over the year. A sidereal day can be easily appreciated byobserving a star returning to the same point in the heavens on two consecutivenights. This is one spin of our planet because it is unaffected by the secondarymotion of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun."},{"pageContent":"WHEELS WITHIN WHEELSEarly cultures frequently took their lead from nature and they were fond of‘wheels within wheels’. If the circle of the heavens had 366 parts, why shouldevery circle not follow the same rule? We were able to confirm this hypothesisby a variety of means including evidence from later cultures that appear to haveadopted the 366-degree principle.The approach our Megalithic ancestors took, we argue, was to hypotheticallydivide the circle of the Earth into 366 degrees with sixty minutes per degreeand six seconds per minute. It was reasonable to assume that these ancientbuilders used the polar circumference of the Earth that passed through the areaaround the British Isles. Our planet is nearly spherical but it does have abulge in the centre between the poles, so the equatorial circumference is alittle longer that the polar. There are varying estimations of the Earth’s polarcircumference, with NASA, for example, quoting an average figure of 39,941km,whilst other sources regularly quote 40,006km or 40,010km – but the mostfrequently used figure appears to be 40,008km. Undoubtedly much depends on wherethe measurement is taken or if an average of them all is calculated.Interestingly, the shortest polar circumference (one that has least landmass) isthe one that passes through the British Isles and is now considered as the zeroline of longitude.But there is also another possibility.Just for interest, we looked at the flattest possible circumference achievableon the globe, i.e. a line that equally bisects the planet that has most sea andleast land. We were amazed to discover that a person standing in the middle ofSalisbury Plain in Wiltshire, England (where Stonehenge and the Megalithiccircle at Avebury were built) is in the absolute centre of such a line. Thismeans that if we consider Stonehenge to be the ‘top’ of the world, the imaginaryequator from that point is almost 98per cent sea – more than any other point onEarth. This line passes across the South Atlantic, skims just below Africa,moves up across the Indian Ocean, clips small pieces of land at Banda Aceh,Sumatra, Thailand and Vietnam, over the South China Sea and then more than20,000 kilometres across the Pacific to pass over a section of South America.As far as we know such a line has not been measured, and we cannot imagine howit could have been measured without the aid of modern satellite technology.However, just because we do not know how it could have been done does not meanthat it was not done. Without further evidence we have to assume that it is purecoincidence that Stonehenge stands on the only place on Earth to be equidistantfrom the optimum and near perfect sea-level circumference of the globe.We can only assume that a polar circumference was used and taking the 40,008kmfigure it translates to 48,221,838 Megalithic Yards using Thom’s central valuefor the unit. It was then subdivided as follows:Polar circumference = 48,221,838 MY1 Degree (1/366th) = 131,754 MY1 Minute (1/60th) = 2,196 MY1 Second (1/6th) = 366 MYSo, this brilliant system of geometry starts with 366 degrees and finishes withseconds of arc that are 366 Megalithic Yards long. Self- evidently, an amazingset of ‘wheels within wheels’!We knew that the system must work this way because we found that the laterMinoan culture, which developed on the Mediterranean island of Crete around 2000BC, also used the Megalithic second of arc. However, the Minoans sub-divided itinto 1,000 parts to become their standard unit of measure that was equal to30.36cm. This unit was dubbed the ‘Minoan Foot’ by the Canadian archaeologist,Professor Joseph Graham who first detected its use in the palaces of ancientCrete.6We went on to demonstrate how any person could generate a highly accurateMegalithic Yard by measuring the movement of Venus in the evening sky using arope, some twine, a blob of clay, and a few sticks. The secret was to take one366th part of the horizon and time the passage of Venus across it, and then tocause a piece of twine with a blob of clay on the end to swing like a pendulum366 times during that period. From fulcrum to the centre of the blob was amathematically perfect 1⁄2 Megalithic Yard or twenty Megalithic Inches. Theprocess was simple to carry out and works on the fact that a pendulum isresponsive to only two factors: the length of the pendulum and the mass of theEarth. If the pendulum beat 366 times during the transit of Venus across a 366thpart of the sky – you had your measure! (See Appendix 1 for a more detailedexplanation of the pendulum method.)It is doubtful that these ancient stonemasons realized the fact but the periodof time that they watched Venus and elected to subdivide into 366 beats, isequal to the difference between a mean solar day and a sidereal day.Our starting point had been to search for all possible sources of reliablemeasurement available from nature. And we found that there was only one: theturning of the Earth on its axis as seen by watching the movement of theheavens. It was possible to time the passage of a star, or in this case theplanet Venus, with reliable accuracy using a pendulum. The pendulum then turneda unit of time into a unit of length because the timed beat will always producea fixed length – with tiny variations due to latitude and altitude.It was then a simple matter to turn a unit of length into a measure of volumeand capacity by creating cubes and filling them with liquid or dry goods such asbarley or wheat. However, we were not prepared for the shock we received when wecreated a cube with sides of four Megalithic Inches and found that it held apint that was accurate to a staggering one part in 5,000 against the standardlaid down in the year 1601. Doubling the sides to eight Megalithic Inchesproduced an accurate gallon and doubling again produced the old dry measureknown as a bushel. The mystery was compounded when we filled the ‘pint’ cubewith barley and found that it weighed exactly one pound!Things turned from the sublime to the ridiculous when further experimentationshowed that a sphere with a diameter of six Megalithic Inches held virtually onelitre and one ten times the size weighed a metric tonne when filled with water;all to an accuracy of better than 99 per cent.The fact that Thom’s apparently meaningless Megalithic Yard, extracted fromsurveying hundreds of prehistoric ruins, produces these cubic and sphericalfeats is not debatable. No one, no matter how sceptical they might be, can denythe simple maths. Neither can they deny that the odds of such compoundedapparent connections being coincidence are very high. Yet, the pound and thepint are thought to be Medieval and the litre and the tonne were invented at theend of the eighteenth century.A connection seemed impossible.Then we looked at the Sumerian people who lived in the region we now call Iraqsome 5,000 years ago. They are attributed with inventing writing, glass, thewheel, the hour, minute and second of time as well as the 360-degree circle withits subdivisions of 60 minutes and 60 seconds of arc. Quite amazing people.As we probed the achievements of this civilization we found that the unit oflength the Sumerians had used was virtually a metre at 99.88cm and that they hadalso used weights and capacities that were as equally matched to the kilo andlitre of the French metric system created thousands of years later. Quite acoincidence we thought – but it was nothing of the kind, for when we applied theprinciples of the pendulum to the Sumerian unit of length called the ‘doublekush’ we found that a pendulum of this length beat at the rate of one persecond. This meant that the Sumerian’s key unit of length and their key unit oftime were two sides of the same coin when used as a pendulum. A double-kushpendulum would always beat out a second and a pendulum that beat at the rate ofa second would always be a double kush in length. This demonstrates beyond allreasonable doubt that the Sumerians used pendulums to define their measurements.The question was, had they used the same Venus-watching principle as theMegalithic builders of the British Isles to reproduce their units?Sumerian written records tell us that the planet Venus was considered to be thegoddess Inanna, who was of central importance to their culture, so it seemedentirely plausible. If they had used the same principle it seemed logical thatthey would have employed their own values; essentially keeping the same‘software’ but inputting their own data. Instead of the 366 degrees of theMegalithic system we would have to use the more familiar 360 degrees first usedby the Sumerians. And when we checked out the results for such a process – itworked perfectly.When the horizon was divided into 360 parts and Venus was timed across that partof the sky at the appropriate time of year the double-kush pendulum metres outexactly 240 seconds. And the period of 240 seconds is recorded as being soimportant to the Sumerians it had its own name – a ‘gesh’. It therefore seemscertain that these people followed the Megalithic idea of creating a unit oflength from timing the movement of Venus across the evening sky."},{"pageContent":"THE AMERICAN CONNECTIONLater in our research we came across a letter written by the great Americanstatesman, Thomas Jefferson and sent to the House of Representatives on July 4th1776. In this letter Jefferson laid out a recommendation for a new system ofweights and measures for the new United States that he had helped to establish.He gave his reasoning and described some unusual facts he had uncovered whilstdeveloping his intended units.He explained how he had realized that there was only one aspect of nature thatgave rise to any reliable unit of measure – which he named as the turning of theEarth. So, like ourselves and the Megalithic builders of five and six millenniabefore him, he used the heavens to provide a basis for all measurement. In hisletter he stated that he had come to realize that the imperial system ofmeasurement used in Britain was not an accumulation of unrelated units asgenerally imagined. On the contrary, he said that their harmony indicated to himthat they were members of a group of measurement units ‘from very highantiquity’.He gave a number of reasons for this belief including his astonishment that thefoot, made up of twelve inches, was directly related to the ounce weight throughthe use of cubes. He said: ‘It has been found by accurate experiments that acubic foot of rain water weighs 1000 ounces avoirdupois (Imperial).’It could be coincidence that a cubic foot holds 1,000 ounces of rainwater, not999 or 1,001, but exactly 1,000 – or that the cube has sides that are a perfect10 x 10 x 10 one-tenths of a foot. But Jefferson did not think so. And nor dowe. However, it was Jefferson’s proposed units that fascinated us. They werenever adopted but their properties are amazing.Jefferson’s logical mind also caused him to use a pendulum to convert time intoa linear unit. He decided that he should use a pendulum that had a beat of onesecond as the basis for his measuring system. Of course, Jefferson had no ideathat the second had come from the Sumerian culture or that it had been createdby the use of a pendulum in the first place. Jefferson added one improvementsuggested to him by a certain Mr Graham of Philadelphia – that he use a rigidpendulum of very thin metal without a weight on the end because it is moreaccurate than a conventional type of pendulum. The rules change with such apendulum (known as a rod). A rod has to be exactly 50 per cent longer than apendulum to produce the same time period. Jefferson’s timing piece, that beatonce per second, is known as a ‘seconds rod’, and is 149.158145cm in length.The world knew nothing of the Sumerian culture in Jefferson’s time and he couldnot possibly have been aware that his rod that beat once per second wasessentially three kush in length – just a whisker less than one and a halfmetres (remembering that the metre had not been invented at that time).The three-kush rod behaves exactly like a double-kush pendulum and therefore itbeats 240 times during one 360th part of a day; observable by watching Venusmove across a 360th part of the sky. Jefferson was therefore accidentallyre-enacting the ritual used by Sumerian astronomer priests nearly 5,000 yearsearlier and connecting with the principles of prehistoric measurements.The units that Jefferson identified from this ancient process were all based onthe length of this ‘seconds rod’. He wrote:‘Let the second rod, then, as before described, be the standard of measure; andlet it be divided into five equal parts, each of which shall be called a foot;for, perhaps, it may be better generally to retain the name of the nearestpresent measure, where one is tolerably near. It will be about one quarter of aninch shorter than the present foot.Let the foot be divided into 10 inches;The inch into 10 lines;The line into 10 points;Let 10 feet make a decad;10 decads one rood;10 roods a furlong;10 furlongs a mile.’We can see that his proposed ‘decad’ was based on a double-seconds rod. It wasequivalent to six Sumerian kush, and his furlong was equal to 600 kush. Thisbrings about an even deeper connection with the people of ancient Iraq becausethey used a system of counting that was sexagesimal; which means it used acombination of base ten and base sixty. They had a system of notation thatworked as follows:StepmultipleValue1.112.x 10103.x 6604.x 106005.x 63,600It can be seen that the figure of 600 is indeed a Sumerian value for a Sumerianunit of length.But not only is the Jefferson furlong equal to 600 kush – it is also an almostperfect 360 Megalithic Yards.Strangely, Jefferson had connected well with both the Megalithic and theSumerian system. But something even stranger happened when we took Jefferson’sfurlong and multiplied it by 366 and 366 again:3662 furlongs = 39,961.257kmAs we have already mentioned, the range of assumed lengths of the Earthcircumference varies by a few kilometres depending on what source one consults,probably because each cross section will differ and tides and plate tectonicsinvolving mountains leave room for some debate. At the higher end 40,008kilometres is widely used, however if we take NASA preferred figures they quotea polar radius of 6,356.8 kilometres which equates to a polar circumference of39,941.0 kilometres.That means that 3662 Jefferson furlongs match Nasa’s estimate of the Earth’ssize to an accuracy of 99.95 per cent – which is as perfect as it gets!"},{"pageContent":"PROBLEMS WITH FOUCAULT’S PENDULUMWe became more and more fascinated by everything to do with pendulums. Duringone particular telephone conversation, which had gone on for over an hour, wehad, yet again, discussed at length the idea that there might be some unknownlaw of astrophysics – that was revealed by pendulums – at work here. Weconsidered some highly speculative thoughts that ranged from standingelectromagnetic sine waves due to a gyroscopic effect of the Earth’s spinthrough to gravitons containing packets of information about ‘geometricalshape’. But we agreed that we just did not know enough to even start toinvestigate such ideas. Chris wrote the following paragraph into a draft of thischapter as a summary of our mutual frustration and finished work for the day.‘We have to admit that we still do not understand why it is so, but the use ofpendulums in association with these ancient values appears to be elemental tothe planet Earth – some physical reality seems to be at work here. Everypendulum reacts to the mass of the Earth but there seems to be some kind of‘harmonic’ response at certain rhythms: points where the mass and the spin ofthe planet resonate in some way.’But at that very point in time everything changed.At five o’ clock the following morning Chris was unable to sleep and decided toget up and make a cup of tea. It was then that a ‘library angel’ turned up.7Looking for something to read he pulled the delivery sleeve of a magazine thathad arrived in the post the previous day and flicked it open. The main featurearticle in this edition of New Scientist was entitled: ‘Shadow over gravity’. Itsounded interesting even early on a dark November morning.But he quickly realized it was far more important than merely ‘interesting’. Theopening paragraph was incredibly similar to that which opens this book, carryinga description of how it feels to witness a total eclipse – and then ittranspired that the thrust of the article was that solar eclipses have aprofound effect on pendulums! A debate is presently raging as to why this shouldbe the case, because the suggestion has been made that pendulums may well be thekey to a significant hole in Einstein’s theory of relativity.The starting point concerns the work of Jean Bernard Leon Foucault whodemonstrated a special quality of pendulums at the Great Exhibition, held inLondon in 1851. His pendulum, now always referred to as ‘Foucault’s pendulum’,is simply a very heavy weight fastened to a very long wire attached to a ceilinginside a very tall building, with a universal joint allowing it to rotate freelyaround a fixed point so that it will swing in a slow arc in any direction. Giantpendulums of this kind are now routine exhibits at some of the major museumsaround the world including the Smithsonian in Washington and the Science Museumin London.Once set in motion its direction of swing will appear to rotate at a rate ofabout twelve degrees an hour. But this is actually an illusion because it is theobserver and the rest of the world that is moving whilst the pendulum ismaintaining a fixed swing back and forth in relation to the Universe. Thishappens because the pendulum is independent of the movement of the Earth, whichis rotating underneath the pendulum, making it appear that the pendulum ischanging direction. The reason a pendulum swings is because the Earth’s gravitycontinually tugs down on it. According to Einstein’s general theory ofrelativity this relentless tugging is due to the fact that every mass bends thefabric of space-time around it causing other masses to slide down into thedimple it creates in space-time.The amount of rotation of a Foucault pendulum is dependent on latitude. At theNorth or South Pole the pendulum appears to rotate through an entire 360 degreesonce every turn of the Earth (each sidereal day) because the planet rotates allthe way round underneath it. In the northern hemisphere at the latitude of theBritish Isles the rate of rotation is reduced to around 280 degrees per day andthe rate of rotation continues to fall the closer one gets to the equator, wherea Foucault pendulum does not rotate at all.For over a hundred years everyone knew that a Foucault’s pendulum would swing inan entirely predictable manner at any specific location. Then in 1954 a Frenchengineer, economist and would-be physicist by the name of Maurice Allais foundthat this was not always the case. He was conducting an experiment at the Schoolof Mining in Paris to investigate a possible link between magnetism andgravitation, in which he released a Foucault pendulum every fourteen minutes forthirty days and nights, recording the direction of rotation in degrees. Bychance, a total solar eclipse occurred on one of those days.Each day the pendulum moved with mechanical precision but on June 30th 1954,when a partial eclipse occurred, one of Allais’ assistants realized that thependulum had gone haywire. As the eclipse began, the swing plane of the pendulumsuddenly started to rotate backwards. It veered furthest off course twentyminutes before maximum eclipse, when the Moon covered a large portion of theSun’s surface before returning to its normal swing once the eclipse was over. Itseemed that the pendulum had somehow been influenced by the alignment of theEarth, the Moon and the Sun.This was totally unexpected and utterly startling. Allais’ experiment was beingconducted indoors, out of the sunlight so there was no apparent way the eclipsecould have affected it. Allais was at a loss to explain what had taken place butwhen he conducted an improved version of his experiment in June and July 1958with two pendulums six kilometres apart he found the same effect. Then duringthe partial solar eclipse of October 22nd 1959, Allais once again witnessed thesame erratic rotation – but this time similar effects were reported by threeRomanian scientists who knew nothing of Allais’ work.Many people have questioned his results, mainly because science does not likethat which it cannot explain. Many others have now repeated the experiment withmixed results: some found no measurable effect, but most have confirmed theresult at different locations – including one conducted in an undergroundlaboratory! 8It is interesting to note that in 1988 Allais was awarded a Nobel Prize foreconomics. Like Alexander Thom (and many other paradigm busters) a majordiscovery had come from someone working outside their own field. These arebright people who are driven by curiosity and who are not the products ofconventional training.Allais despairs at the standards of those that oppose without logic orreasoning: ‘In the history of science, every revolutionary result meets withvery strong opposition… Relativists say I’m wrong without providing anydemonstration. Most of them haven’t even read what I wrote.’In 1970 Erwin Saxl and Mildred Allen of Mount Holyoke College, Massachusetts,studied the behaviour of a pendulum before, during and after a total eclipse.The pair took a slightly different approach to Allais as they used a torsionpendulum, which is a massive disc suspended from a wire attached to its centre.Rotating the disc slightly causes the wire to twist. When it is released, thedisc continues to twirl first clockwise, then anticlockwise, with a fixedperiod. But during an eclipse, their pendulum sped up significantly. Theyconcluded that gravitational theory needs to be modified.In India in 1995, D C Mishra and M B S Rao of the National Geophysical ResearchInstitute in Hyderabad observed a small but sudden drop in the strength ofgravity when using an extremely accurate gravimeter during a solar eclipse. Butresults have been mixed. When the eclipsed Sun rose above Helsinki on July 22nd1990, Finnish geophysicists found no disturbance to the usual swing, yet inMarch 1997 scientists observed gravimeter anomalies during an eclipse in a veryremote area of north-east China.The mystery continues and yet no academic institution appears willing to investtime and money to study this phenomenon in depth. However, Thomas Goodey, aself-funding independent researcher from Brentford in England, has decided thathe will investigate the Allais effect by using several pendulums during aneclipse. Because modern equipment is much more accurate and sensitive than thatavailable in 1954 – giving twenty to one hundred times better resolution, he isconfident of a clear result.Goodey plans to travel the world over the next few years with twelve speciallyconstructed pendulums. In May 2004, he presented his strategy at a meeting ofthe Society for Scientific Exploration in Las Vegas and invited physicists tojoin him. As New Scientist reported, several leapt at the chance.Goodey suspects that the anomalies occur when an observer is near the line thatconnects the centres of masses of the Sun and the Moon. During a total solareclipse, the Sun–Moon line intersects the surface of the Earth at two points onroughly opposite sides of the globe. This theory would explain why the sunriseeclipse in Helsinki did not produce a result. Goodey is quoted as saying thatobservations at this ‘anti-eclipse’ point where no eclipse is visible mightcarry much greater weight.We wait with interest to hear the final results of Thomas Goodey’s experiments.At this point it seems as though we might well have been right to suspect thatpendulums reveal a great deal about the nature of our planet’s gravity and itsgravitational relationship with the Moon and the Sun. Could it be that becausethe Moon blocks out the disc of the Sun so perfectly it is acting as a shield toan ongoing interaction between the Earth and the Sun? Or perhaps it is becauseall three centres of mass are lined up and something physical occurs at thistime?We also wonder whether the unknown individuals who devised the Megalithic Yardand its inherent geometry understood much more about this pendulum effect thanwe do. Our previous findings strongly suggest that they knew a great deal moreabout the Earth –Moon–Sun relationship."},{"pageContent":"A SPECIAL RELATIONSHIPOur initial findings about Megalithic geometry, described in Civilization One,had caused us to examine all kinds of unexpected relationships between the Earthand ancient measures. This had further prompted us to wonder whether the 366geometry, that produced the Megalithic Yard, was in some way planet specific.Was there some connection between the mass, spin and solar orbit that made itspecial to the Earth?First we applied the principles of Megalithic geometry to all of the planets ofthe solar system. No discernable pattern emerged – they appeared to becompletely random results. For example Mars produced 19.78 Megalithic Yards persecond of arc and Venus an unimpressive 347.8. We also checked out the majormoons of other planets to no avail.A good friend of Chris, Dr Hilary Newbigen, suggested that, for thoroughness, wetry using the number of days per orbit for each planet to see if there was arelationship to the individual dimensions, but again the results were negative.Then we looked at Earth’s Moon.The result here was anything but meaningless. We took the Moon’s radius, definedby NASA as being 1,738,100 kilometres, to calculate a circumference of ameaningless sounding 10,920,800 metres. We then converted this distance intoMegalithic Yards, which gave us the equally apparently arbitrary value of13,162,900.We then applied the rules of Megalithic geometry by dividing this circumferenceinto 366 degrees, sixty minutes and six seconds of arc. To our total amazementthere were 100 Megalithic Yards per lunar Megalithic second of arc. The accuracyof the result was 99.9 per cent which is well within the range of error of thiskind of calculation.How strange that the Megalithic Yard is so elegantly ‘lunardetic’ as well asgeodetic!Our next thought was the Sun. Because we know that the Sun is 400 times the sizeof the Moon it should logically have a perfect 40,000 Megalithic Yards persecond of arc. For thoroughness we checked out the sums and it did indeed workas perfectly as we expected.This all seemed very odd. The Megalithic structures that were built acrosswestern Europe were frequently used to observe the movements of the Sun and theMoon, but how could the unit of measure upon which these structures were basedbe so beautifully integer to the circumference of these bodies as well as of theEarth?Is it coincidence? On top of all the other strange facts regarding the Moon itbecomes rather unrealistic to keep putting everything down to a random fluke ofnature. Of course, we were well aware that the numbers we were looking at wereonly integer when one uses base ten – and we will deal with that issue later.If it is not coincidence then there are only two other options. The first isthat there is some unknown law of astrophysics at work, causing relationships toemerge that were spotted in some way by our Stone-Age forebears. The other isconscious design.The idea of deliberate design seemed plum crazy – common sense tells us it’swrong. Then we, once again, considered more wise words from Albert Einstein:‘Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.’At the age of eighteen we, like everyone else, ‘knew’ that everything in theworld was natural. But when we put our prejudices of what can and cannot be, toone side and thought laterally about it, the more reasonable it seemed.It was not unreasonable to believe that the stonemasons of the Neolithic periodwere smart enough to measure the polar circumference of the Earth and that theydevised a unit of measure that was integer to the planet. Such a feat can beachieved with very simple tools as demonstrated by the Ancient Greeks. But couldthey really have measured the circumference of the Moon and the Sun?Or was this mysterious property of pendulums something to do with it?Most of all we marvelled at the fact that, yet again, it was the size andposition of the Moon that revealed that there is an issue to resolve."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER THREETHE ORIGIN OF THE MOON‘The best explanation for the Moon is observational error – the Moon does notexist!’Attributed to Irwin Shapiro of The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for AstrophysicsThe one inescapable fact about the Moon is that it orbits the Earth. It is upthere beaming down on us, but according to everything that science knows, itshouldn’t be.As we have seen, it is known that people have been Moon-gazing for tens ofthousands of years, and our understanding has grown to a point where we are nowvery confused.The Greeks were great gatherers of knowledge and investigators of the rules ofnature. In the fifth century BC Democritus, who originated the theory thatmatter was made of indivisible units he called atoms, went to the other end ofthe scale and suggested that the markings on the Moon could be mountains. Alittle later Eudoxus of Cnidus, who was an astronomer and mathematician,calculated the Saros cycle of eclipses and thereby could predict when they wouldappear.Around 260 BC, yet another Greek by the name of Aristarchus, devised a method bywhich he thought he could measure the size of the Moon and gauge its distancefrom Earth. He never actually achieved it but a mathematician and astronomer ofmajor importance known as Hipparchus of Rhodes achieved the feat around ahundred years later. He used an ingenious technique that was conducted during asolar eclipse. The eclipse in question was total in Syene but only partial inAlexandria which was some 729 kilometres away. Enlisting the help of like-mindedfriends, Hipparchus was able to use the known distance from Syene to Alexandria,together with the angular difference of the total and partial eclipse toestablish the Moon’s true size and distance from the Earth.At the end of the first century AD, Plutarch wrote a short work about the Moon,entitled On the Face in the Moon’s Orb where he suggested that the markings onthe face of the Moon were caused by deep recesses, too deep to reflect sunlight.He proposed that the Moon had mountains and river valleys and even speculatedthat people might live there.Although a Hindu astronomer, Aryabbata, repeated and confirmed the experimentconducted by Hipparchus as late as 500 AD, Christian authorities of the timemaintained a biblical approach to the Moon and only information about our nearneighbour that didn’t contradict the scriptures was countenanced. With thearrival of Christianity the world entered a dark age where scripture rather thanscience was the only permitted guide to human existence.The grip of the Church slipped somewhat during the fifteenth and sixteenthcenturies and the Renaissance (literally meaning ‘rebirth’) emerged bringingradical and comprehensive changes to European culture. The Renaissance broughtabout the demise of the Middle Ages and for the first time the values of themodern world made an appearance. The consciousness of cultural rebirth wasitself a characteristic of the Renaissance. Italian scholars and critics of thisperiod proclaimed that their age had progressed beyond the barbarism of the pastand had found its inspiration, and its closest parallel, in the civilizations ofancient Greece and Rome. By the end of the sixteenth century, a genius from thetown of Pisa called Galileo Galilei became one of the most important scientistsof the Renaissance carrying out experiments into pendulums, falling weights, thebehaviour of light and many other subjects that captured his imagination. Aboveall, for most of his adult life Galileo was an avid astronomer.In May 1609, Galileo received a letter from Paolo Sarpi telling him about aningenious spyglass that a Dutchman had shown in Venice. Galileo wrote in April1610:‘About ten months ago a report reached my ears that a certain Fleming hadconstructed a spyglass by means of which visible objects, though very distantfrom the eye of the observer, were distinctly seen as if nearby. Of this trulyremarkable effect several experiences were related, to which some personsbelieved while others denied them. A few days later the report was confirmed bya letter I received from a Frenchman in Paris, Jacques Badovere, which caused meto apply myself wholeheartedly to investigate means by which I might arrive atthe invention of a similar instrument. This I did soon afterwards, my basisbeing the doctrine of refraction.’From these reports, and by applying his skills as a mathematician and acraftsman, Galileo began to make a series of telescopes with an opticalperformance much better than that of the Dutch instrument. His first telescopewas made from available lenses and gave a magnification of about four times, butto improve on this Galileo taught himself to grind and polish his own lenses andby August 1609 he had an instrument with a magnification of around eight ornine. He quickly realized the commercial and military value of hissuper-telescope that he called a perspicillum, particularly for seafaringpurposes. As the winter of 1609 brought colder, clearer nights Galileo turnedhis telescope towards the night sky and began to make a series of trulyremarkable discoveries.The astronomical discoveries he made with his telescopes were described in ashort book called The Starry Messenger published in Venice in May of thefollowing year – and they caused a sensation! Amongst many other findingsGalileo claimed to have proved that the Milky Way was made up of tiny stars, tohave seen four small moons orbiting Jupiter and to have seen mountains on theMoon.As with many of his scientific investigations Galileo could easily have fallenfoul of the Church authorities if his drawings of the Moon had been made public.According to Christian tradition both the Sun and the Moon were perfect,unblemished spheres. They simply had to be so because God had created them – andnone of the Almighty’s creations could be flawed. Eventually Galileo was putunder perpetual house arrest by the Papacy for his blasphemous claim that theSun was at the centre of the solar system. It is therefore quite possible thathe knew more about the Moon than he was willing to admit in public.In order to explain the markings on the Moon without treading on the toes of theChurch, a number of ideas were put forward in Christian countries. Perhaps themost popular of these, at least for a while, was the suggestion that the Moonwas a perfect mirror. If this was the case there were no markings on the Moonbut rather reflections of surface features on the Earth. It didn’t seem to occurto anyone that as the Moon orbited the Earth the markings should change, sincethe land beneath it would not remain constant.Another suggestion, and one that was accepted in some circles, was that therewere mysterious vapours between the Earth and the Moon. The images, it wassuggested, were present in sunlight and were merely being reflected from ‘thevapours’. But the most popular theory, probably because it didn’t impinge onChristian doctrine, was that there were variations in the density of the Moonand that these created the optical illusions we see as markings on the Moon’ssurface. This unlikely explanation was safe, though it probably did little toconvince early scientists, and certainly would not have impressed Galileo.After Galileo’s time, telescopes improved markedly and it was obvious to anyonewho studied the Moon that it was a sphere with a rocky and undulating surface.As the Church gradually lost its power to direct scientific thought, many of theearlier ideas regarding the Moon became unthinkable. But no one had any idea howthe Moon had come into being and why it occupied the orbit it did around theEarth.It didn’t take long for the subject of the Moon to become very important toastronomers. Empires such as those created by Britain, France and Spain, wereexpanding. This necessitated long sea voyages and led to that most urgent ofsearches – a way to plot ‘longitude’ whilst at sea. It is quite easy toestablish one’s position on the planet in a north–south line (latitude) but itwas impossible to know where you were in terms of east–west (longitude). In thenorthern hemisphere, for example, latitude can be quickly gauged by measuringthe angular distance between the horizon and the Pole Star. This angle alsodefines one’s position north of the equator.The longitude problem was eventually solved by having an extremely accurateclock on board a ship that was set to the time at one’s point of departure. Itwasn’t difficult to work out the difference between local time, say at midday,and the time at the home port. It was then simply a matter of adding orsubtracting to discover one’s true position on the Earth’s surface. This wasfine but it took many decades before a suitably accurate clock could be created.In the meantime, astronomers sought for other methods to determine longitude,not least of all because there was a fabulous prize on offer for anyone whocould crack the problem. And the place where many of them turned to establishlongitude was the Moon.Astronomers proposed that if really accurate tables were kept of the Moon’sposition relative to the background stars it would be possible to assess thetrue time of day in one’s home port. The reason this could work was that theMoon, being very close to the Earth and orbiting quickly, moved across theheavens by around thirteen degrees of arc per day. Using the Moon it was afairly simple matter to establish ‘local time’ and then to do the necessarycomputations to discover one’s position.The lists of tables necessary to accomplish the task were not so simple,however, and as soon as good chronometers were available the Moon was abandonedas a means for longitude assessment. However, the desire to solve this problem,and the potential profitability of doing so, meant that the Moon was receiving agreat deal of attention during the seventeenth century and very accurate maps ofits surface began to appear.It wasn’t until the nineteenth century, however, that probably the firstreasoned explanation as to the Moon’s origin was put forward. George Darwin, theson of Charles Darwin, the controversial Englishman who first proposed thetheory of natural selection, was a known and respected astronomer who studiedthe Moon extensively and came up with what became known as the ‘fission theory’in 1878. George Darwin may have been the first astronomer to ascertain that theMoon was moving away from the Earth. Working backwards from his knowledge of therate the Moon was receding from the Earth, Darwin proposed a time that the Earthand the Moon could have been part of the same common mass. He suggested thatthis molten, viscous sphere had been rotating extremely rapidly in about fiveand a half hours.Darwin further speculated that the tidal action of the Sun had caused what hetermed as ‘fission’ – a Moon-sized dollop of the molten Earth spinning away fromthe main mass and eventually taking up station in orbit. At the time this seemedvery reasonable and was the favoured theory by the beginning of the twentiethcentury. In fact the fission theory did not come under serious attack until the1920s when a British astronomer called Harold Jeffries was able to show that theviscosity of the Earth in its semi-molten state would have dampened the motionsrequired to generate the right sort of vibration necessary to fulfil Darwin’sfission.A second theory that once convinced a number of experts was the ‘coaccretiontheory’. This postulates that the Earth, having already been formed, accumulateda disc of solid particles – a little like the rings of Saturn. It was suggestedthat, in the case of the Earth, this disc of particles ultimately came togetherto form the Moon. There are several reasons why this theory can’t be the answer.Not least is the problem of the angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system thatcould never have been as it is, if the Moon had formed in this way. There arealso difficulties regarding the melting of the magma ocean of the infant Moon.The third theory regarding the origin of the Moon that was in circulation aroundthe time that the first lunar probes were launched was the ‘intact capturetheory’. At one time seeming to be the most attractive possibility, the intactcapture theory suggested that the Moon originated far from the Earth and thatthe Moon became a ‘rogue’ body that was simply captured by the gravitationalpull of the Earth and that it took up orbit around the Earth.There are many reasons why the intact capture theory is now disregarded. Oxygenisotopes of the rocks on the Moon and on the Earth prove conclusively that theyoriginated at the same distance from the Sun, which could not be the case if theMoon had been formed elsewhere. There are also insurmountable problems in tryingto build a model that would allow a body as big as the Moon to take up orbitaround the Earth. Such a huge object could not simply drift neatly into an Earthorbit at low speed like carefully docking a super-tanker – it would almostcertainly smash into the Earth at a massive speed or possibly skim off andhurtle onward.By the middle of the 1970s all previous theories about the way the Moon had beenformed were running into trouble for one reason or another and this created avirtually unthinkable situation in which acclaimed experts might have to standup in public and admit that they simply didn’t know how or why the Moon wasthere. As acclaimed science writer William K Hartmann, senior scientist at thePlanetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona said in 1986 in his book Origin ofthe Moon:‘Neither the Apollo astronauts, the Luna vehicles, nor all the king’s horses andall the king’s men could assemble enough data to explain the circumstances ofthe moon’s birth.’ 9Out of this miasma came a new theory and, in fact, the only one that ispresently widely accepted despite some fundamental problems. It is known as the‘Big Whack theory’.The idea came out of theories that originated in the Soviet Union in the 1960s –specifically the work of Russian scientist V S Savronov, who had been working onthe possibility of planetary origins from literally millions of different-sizedasteroids known as planetesimals.As a divergence from the Soviet ideas, Hartmann, together with a colleague, D RDavis, suggested that the Moon had come into being as a result of the collisionof two planetary bodies, one being the Earth and the other a rogue planet atleast as large as the planet Mars. Hartmann and Davis hypothesized that the twoplanets had collided in a very specific way that allowed jets of matter to beejected from the mantles of both bodies. This matter was thrown into orbit,where it eventually came together to form the Moon.10The suggestion seems to have many merits. First and foremost it appears toaddress the greatest puzzle that the recovery of Moon rock had thrown up: Howwas it that the composition of the Moon was so similar to that of the Earth, butonly in part?A close analysis of Moon rock has shown that it is very similar to the rock thatforms the mantle of the Earth, yet the Moon is nowhere near as massive as theEarth in proportional terms. (The Earth is only 3.66 times as big as the Moonbut has eighty-one times the Moon’s mass.) It was obvious that the Moon couldnot contain many of the heavy elements that are found inside the Earth and theBig Whack theory purported to explain why this was the case. The Earth and therogue visitor had come together in a very specific way. Although they wouldeventually form one planet it was reasoned that they must have impacted, drawnapart and then come together again. Computer modelling showed that under thesevery special circumstances it would have been possible for the material thrownoff to have been mantle material, from close to the surface of the two bodies.Although the theory eventually gained ground, at first it seemed so improbablethat it was generally rejected. But with the passing of time, further workshowed that such an unlikely scenario could conceivably have taken place. In1983 an international conference was held at Kona, Hawaii, to try and solve theproblems regarding the origins of the Moon. It was at this meeting that the BigWhack theory, also known as the Giant Impact Hypothesis of the CollisionEjection theory, began to gain ground. Hartmann’s own suggestions, together withthose of other scientists at the conference, formed the nucleus of the 1986book, Origin of the Moon, which was edited by Hartmann himself.In the intervening period several experts have created computer models thatpurport to add weight to the Big Whack theory and the most convincing of theseare those of Dr Robin Canup, who is now Assistant Director of the Department ofSpace Studies in Colorado, USA. Canup wrote her PhD dissertation on the Moon’sorigin and specifically the Big Whack theory. Her early work led to theconclusion that the suggested impact would have actually led to a swarm ofmoonlets, rather than the Moon, but by 1997 further computer modelling resultedin a model of the impact that would lead to the Moon’s presence.Despite the fact that the Big Whack theory is now generally accepted by mostauthorities, it has many problems. Not least of all is that recognized by RobinCanup herself as she admits that there is one key aspect of the theory thatdoesn’t make sense. This stems from the fact that other researchers have pointedout that such a massive impact as that proposed could not have failed to speedup the rotation of the Earth to a level far beyond today’s situation. Canupagrees and the only way that she could deal with this anomaly is to propose asecond major impact – which was designated ‘Big Whack II’. This suggests thatthe second planetary collision happened perhaps only a few thousand years afterthe first one but, quite incredibly, this incoming object came from the oppositedirection and so cancelled out the huge spin imparted to the Earth by the firstcataclysmic event. This balanced double act sounds unlikely in the extreme. Twocosmic collisions that just happen to precisely return the planet to its naturalrhythm? To us, this explanation smacks of desperation!Canup herself is not happy with Big Whack II and is hopeful of modifying theoriginal theory so that it can account for the present rate of spin of theEarth.There is another big problem to overcome if the Big Whack theory is to be takenseriously. When rocks were brought back from the Moon, both by Americanastronauts and Soviet unmanned Moon missions, they were subjected to everyconceivable test. The observed fact that put paid to the captured asteroidtheory of the Moon is also a gigantic stumbling block to the Big Whack theory.It has been observed that the oxygen isotope signatures of Moon rocks areidentical with those of rocks from the Earth – and that fact has some seriousimplications: Moon rocks and Earth rocks can only have the same oxygen isotopesignature if they originated at the same distance from the Sun. This would meanthat the Mars-sized body that hit the Earth must have occupied a similar orbitto that of the Earth and yet had already managed to survive for many millions ofyears before it hit the Earth.That does not sound reasonable.This situation is extremely unlikely and it throws up other difficulties. Thepresent obliquity of the Earth (its twenty-three degree tilt against the planeof its orbit around the Sun) is usually deemed to be the result of the giantimpact, but any body of the size of Mars that was in an orbit similar to that ofthe Earth could not have had sufficient momentum to knock the Earth’s angle ofrotation back so severely. Either the rogue planet was Mars-sized, and came fromway out in the solar system and was therefore travelling extremely fast, or elseit had to be at least three times the size of Mars, which doesn’t tie in withthe computer models as they stand.Some of the other problems were cited by Jack J Lissauer, a well-respectedscientist from NASA’s Ames Research Center in an article he wrote for Naturein1997.11 Lissauer is said to have joked to his students about a remark made byanother scientist, Irwin Shapiro from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center forAstrophysics: ‘The best explanation for the Moon is observational error – theMoon does not exist!’Lissauer’s article pointed out some of the problems with the Big Whack theory.He made it clear that in his opinion the latest research demonstrated that muchof the material blown out by the impact (the ejecta) would have fallen back tothe Earth. He says:‘The implication here is that lunar growth in an impact-produced disk is notvery efficient. So, to form our Moon, more material must be placed in orbit at agreater distance from Earth than was previously believed.’Lissauer made it clear that as a result, he too is of the opinion that the rogueplanet must have been substantially larger than that originally proposed butnoted that it is difficult to see how the excess angular momentum resulting fromsuch a large impact could have been lost.Three other scientists, Ruzicka, Snyder and Taylor, approached the problem froma slightly different direction by analysing the biochemical data availableagainst the theoretical Big Whack. After a detailed examination they concluded:‘There is no strong geochemical support for either the Giant Impact orImpact-triggered Fission hypotheses.’12These words used in the conclusion to this biochemical analysis indicate justhow hopelessly contrived the whole Big Whack theory is. They go on to say: ‘This[hypothesis] has arisen not so much because of the merits of [its] theory asbecause of the apparent dynamical or geochemical short-comings of othertheories.’In other words scientists hang onto the Big Whack theory, even though it hasmore holes than a rusty colander, simply because no other logical explanationhas been found. It is just the least impossible explanation for a celestial bodythat has no right to be there.Not only is the Big Whack theory discredited on a number of grounds by thescientific fraternity itself, it also singularly fails to deal with theanomalies thrown up by our own research, as outlined throughout this book. BigWhack cannot explain the extraordinary ratio relationship between the Moon andthe Sun or the Moon and the Earth. The Moon could, by pure chance, end up beingexactly 1/400th the size of the Sun and occupying an orbit that allows it tostand 1/400th the distance between the Earth and the Sun – but the odds are,quite literally, astronomically against it.The Moon is proportionally bigger in relation to its host planet than any otherin the solar system apart from Charon, Pluto’s moon, which is more than half thediameter of Pluto. These two bodies are essentially twin planets or may beasteroids orbiting each other at close range although they are believed to havean unrelated origin.Mercury has no moons at all and neither has Venus. Mars does have two moons butthey are tiny in comparison with our own.A close examination of the many samples of Moon rock brought back by theAmerican Apollo missions and the Soviet unmanned missions has thrown up whatturned out to be one of the biggest surprises of all. It has been observed thatthe oldest of the rocks collected from the Moon are significantly more ancientthat any rock ever found on Earth. The most venerable rocks to be found on theEarth date back 3.5 billion years, whilst some samples from the Moon are around4.5 billion years old – which is very close to the estimated age of our solarsystem. When radioactive dating techniques are applied to meteorites they areuniformly found to be 4.6 billion years old.Yet even these rocks have the same oxygen isotope signature as those on Earth,another indication that the Moon has occupied its present distance from the Sunfor an incredibly long time. There is currently no persuasive argument for thisstate of affairs.Our own, almost accidental, discoveries regarding the peculiar ratiorelationships between the Earth, Moon and Sun described in our previous book,Civilization One,13 led us to an in-depth appraisal of the latest theoriesregarding the Moon and its origins. We were stunned by what we discovered. TheMoon is bigger than it should be, apparently older than it should be and muchlighter in mass than it should be. It occupies an unlikely orbit and is soextraordinary that all existing explanations for its presence are fraught withdifficulties and none of them could be considered remotely watertight. We cameto realize that many reputable experts across the world have significantmisgivings about current theories concerning the Moon’s origins that, as we haveshown in this chapter, they were quite willing to voice publicly.No matter how much the advocates of the Big Whack theory may claim they havesolved the puzzle that is the Moon, it is quite obvious that this claim is farfrom being true. The Moon remains, to borrow the words of Winston Churchill, ‘ariddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma’."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FOURWALKING ON THE MOON‘We choose to go to the moon.’President John F Kennedy: September 12th, 1962After the end of the Second World War, rocket scientists from Germany were‘liberated’ by both the United States and the Soviet Union, and by the beginningof the 1950s these experts were put to work on creating weapons of various sortsthat would fuel the Cold War between the Eastern communists and the Westerncapitalists. On the American side the most famous of the German experts wasVernher Von Braun who had created the V1 and V2 rockets for Nazi Germany and whoeventually went on to design the Saturn V rocket that would take people to theMoon.At the outset the USA focused its attentions on developing new types of smallbut immensely powerful hydrogen bombs based on nuclear fusion whilst the USSRcontinued to refine the older and much heavier fission bomb. The Sovietstherefore had to develop more powerful rockets and the R-7 missile, capable ofcarrying a five-tonne warhead, was the result. Their Chief Designer, SergeiKorolyov, realized that these rockets would also be capable of putting aone-and-a-half tonne satellite into Earth’s orbit and he put forward his planfor such a mission.Korolyov’s project was well under way when news came that the US was developingits own satellite launch, known as Project Vanguard. This new challenge set up a‘race to space’ and Korolyov’s main satellite project was temporarily suspendedas all efforts became focused on the early launch of a smaller artificialsatellite that could be built far more quickly. Sputnik lifted into the skies onOctober 4th 1957.This first spacecraft was a forty-pound sphere that carried a simple transmitterso that it could make meaningless, but technical sounding, bleeping sounds atwhich the world could marvel. The acclaim and sheer excitement caused bySputnik’s success led the Soviet leader, Nikita Khruschev, to demand morehigh-profile stunts rather than a return to serious science. The team respondedimmediately by screwing together the original Sputnik’s backup spares to createa second Sputnik. They had only a few weeks as they were instructed that thenext launch must happen before November 7th – the fortieth anniversary of theGreat October Revolution.Sputnik 2 was something of a botched job but it captured the imagination of theplanet because it took off four days ahead of the anniversary and, amazingly, itwas carrying a passenger: a dog called Laika. Unfortunately for this caninehero, her ticket was strictly one way because this hastily assembled craft hadno mechanism for a controlled return to Earth – so the animal was destined todie in orbit from the outset. It is thought that she lived for four days inspace before suffering a painful death as the cabin overheated. The fatality waspart of the plan and the mission was considered a success as it proved that aliving creature could survive the journey into orbit. So despite the fact thatSputnik 2 was initiated as a publicity stunt it was an important prelude to ahuman being making the trip.The first two Sputniks were therefore politically inspired projects carried outby Sergei Korolyov under orders from the Kremlin and it was not until May 15th1958 that his original spacecraft was launched – now designated Sputnik 3. Thiswas a serious piece of equipment that was an automated scientific laboratory. Itcarried twelve instruments providing data on pressure and composition of theupper atmosphere; concentration of charged particles; photons in cosmic rays;heavy nuclei in cosmic rays; magnetic and electrostatic fields; and meteoricparticles. And it was Sputnik 3 that first detected the presence of the outerradiation belts that surround the Earth.The United States was highly embarrassed by the Soviet achievements, andparticularly so because it was having little success with its own rocketlaunchers. So many of them blew up on the launch pad or during takeoff that theworld’s press variously dubbed the American space mission ‘Kaputnik, Flopnik,and Stayputnik’.In the summer of 1958 the Western world was rocking and rolling to ElvisPresley’s ‘Hound Dog’, ‘Heartbreak Hotel’ and ‘Jailhouse Rock’ whilst thepoliticians of the ex-Russian territory of Alaska were lobbying to be acceptedas the 49th State of the Union. In Washington, however, the US government’s mainfocus was on something much more important – a new idea that was going to be agrand solution to a double-edged problem.Their first concern was Sputnik. These high-profile launches had veryeffectively announced to the world that Soviet scientists were smarter thanAmerican ones and it was also implicit that the ‘bad guys’ had the technology todeliver heavy nuclear weapons around the planet. America had fallen well behindin the race for definitive military advantage and the idea of a ‘first strike’by the Soviets suddenly seemed possible and, for some, even probable given theUSA’s current inability to respond in kind.The second problem was one of internal power blocks. The US Army and Navy werepolitically untouchable and each had separate rocketry programmes causingduplication of effort that was dramatically slowing down the rate of overallprogress. In the light of all this, Congress decided to side step militaryfiefdoms and set up a new organization to oversee and coordinate American spaceresearch.Accordingly the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was formedon October 1st 1958 and the idea of putting a man into space was immediatelyoutlined, and given the title ‘Project Mercury’. But it was a race they weredestined to lose because on April 12th 1961 cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became thefirst human to travel into space.Gagarin’s 108-minute voyage took him once around the planet, although he was notallowed to operate the controls because the effects of weightlessness had onlybeen tested on dogs, and scientists were concerned that he may not be able tofunction properly. Consequently, ground crews controlled the mission with anoverride key provided just in case of an emergency.NASA responded quickly by sending the astronaut Alan Shepherd on a ballistictrajectory sub-orbital flight to an altitude of 116 miles, returning to Earth ata landing point just 302 miles down the Atlantic Missile Range. America’s firstmanned space flight was a fifteen minute sky rocket event that was nowhere nearthe same league as Yuri Gagarin’s 25,000 mile, high-speed voyage into Earth’sorbit.The race to get a man into space had been won by the USSR but there was asecond, more ambitious competition running in parallel. Reaching for the Moon!At first these were half-hearted attempts to get some metal, any bit of metal,onto the Moon. It had started with the first Pioneer rocket launched in 1958 bythe United States – which lasted a full seventy-seven seconds beforedisintegrating into a giant fireball. A few months later the USSR launched LunaI, which performed beautifully but unfortunately missed the Moon and headed intosolar orbit. In September 1959 the USSR managed to hit the bull’s-eye when Luna2 became the first craft to land on another celestial body, slamming into theMoon’s surface just east of the Sea of Serenity. Before the impact Luna 2 wasable to report back that there was something very odd about the Moon – it didnot seem to have a magnetic field.The next Soviet craft, Luna 3, made a great stride forward by swinging aroundthe Moon, taking photographs of the ‘dark’ side before heading back to Earth inApril 1960. The Americans meanwhile had failure after failure.Nikita Khrushchev was pleased with the way that his nation was winning the spacerace and when Yuri Gagarin had orbited the Earth his propaganda machine wentinto overdrive to ensure that the world knew how superior his space engineerswere. America’s newly elected President was no slouch when it came to inspiringthe public and John F Kennedy decided to take control of the situation byannouncing that the real battle was to put men on the Moon. Despite a history ofunderperformance in space technology, he rather bravely publicly pledged to landa man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s.Many American Ranger and Soviet Luna spacecraft headed for the Moon during thedecade but a large number missed and others crashed onto the lunar surfaceeither by accident or sometimes by design. But it was the USSR, once again, thatmade the next breakthrough when Luna 9 became the first spacecraft to make acontrolled landing onto the surface of another celestial body on February 3rd1966.A significant part of the problem was the weird nature of the Moon’s mass thatwas not at all what was expected. Instead of a generally constant gravitationalfield such as the Earth exhibits across its surface, the Moon is aninconsistent, lumpy ball that has huge variations in gravity from region toregion.As we have discussed, a pendulum swings with fairly regular precision on theEarth, with only quite small variations in swing rate because of the bulging ofthe planet at the equator. This is due to the fact that a person standing at sealevel at the equator is a little further away from Earth’s dense core thansomeone closer to one of the poles. Using a pendulum on the Moon would notproduce any meaningful result because of what are known as ‘mascons’.The term mascon is an abbreviation for ‘mass concentration’ – regions of theMoon that have hugely dense material below the surface, rather than in the coreas everyone would naturally expect. These mascons made it very difficult forspacecraft to orbit close to the Moon without continual adjustments tocompensate for the variations in gravity. Some observers believe that it wasthis gravitational minefield that caused all of the problems for the earlyprobes that were directed on the basis of a homogeneous gravity.The existence of mascons was discovered after Lunar Orbiter 1 went into orbitaround the Moon on August 14th 1966 and sent back high-quality images of overtwo million square miles of lunar surface, including the first detailed imagesof potential landing sites for the planned Apollo missions.This new discovery of gravitational ‘hotspots’ on the Moon had an impact on aman who is arguably the greatest science fiction writer of all time and anacknowledged inspiration to NASA. Arthur C Clarke combined forces with filmdirector Stanley Kubrick to write and shoot the most realistic space adventureever. When their film 2001: A Space Odyssey premiered in April 1968, it stunnedaudiences across the world with its beautifully produced vision of the future.The plot of the film starts millions of years ago when our ancestors were stillapelike creatures without speech or tools. There is a visitation from someundisclosed power in the form of a jet-black and perfectly finished rectangularmonolith that stands upright. When touched by the probing fingers of the gang ofprimates at dawn the monolith somehow remaps their brains to begin a processthat will take these proto-humans on the evolutionary road to intellectualdevelopment. As the camera pans up the length of the monolith the Sun and theMoon appear directly overhead as though an eclipse is about to occur. The scenethen leaps forward to the beginning of the twenty-first century when a powerfulmagnetic anomaly is discovered just below the surface of the Moon in the Tychocrater and excavations are carried out to discover what is causing the effect. Ablack monolith, some four metres tall is uncovered and a team of experts setsout from Earth to investigate the clearly artificial phenomenon.The team travel to the Tycho crater as the Sun rises and wearing spacesuits theywalk down a ramp into the pit where the monolith stands just a few metres belowthe surface. Like the man-apes millions of years earlier the team leader, DrFloyd, is mesmerized by this alien structure and he touches it with his glovedhand. A moment later a ray of sunlight comes over the edge of the pit andstrikes the monolith, signalling the end of the dark lunar night that lasts fortwo Earth weeks. This time, as we look up the monolith we see the Sun and Earthhovering directly above and almost touching. Then suddenly, the object transmitsa signal in the direction of one of the moons of Jupiter (in Clarke’s novelversion this was changed to Iapetus, one of Saturn’s moons).The ingenious idea that Clarke put forward here was astonishingly close to thereal-world discovery of the lunar mascons that had been made around the time hewas writing. The similarity between Clarke’s magnetic anomaly and thegravitational anomalies are obvious. We wonder whether Clarke was aware of thenewly discovered mascons and whether that gave him the idea of a kind of tripswitch placed on the Moon in the extreme past by some alien intelligence totrigger a signal that told them that creatures from the Earth had become smartenough to reach the Moon and spot a serious abnormality.What a brilliant concept!If an alien intelligence had indeed been responsible for the evolution of humansfrom ape to technologist, then what better way would there be of setting up analarm system to confirm our intellectual ‘arrival’.At the time that Clarke and Kubrick’s film was first capturing the imaginationof a generation, no human had yet reached the Moon. But the following year, withless than six months to go to the late President Kennedy’s deadline, CommanderNeil Armstrong stepped out onto the surface of the Moon on July 20th 1969 withhis famous but slightly misdelivered line:‘That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.’At this point we must mention that there are some people who seriously believethat NASA faked the Moon landings on a film set just like the one used byStanley Kubrick. The evidence they produce looks reasonable at a casual glance;assuming you know nothing at all about photography or the facts relating tolunar conditions. These ideas suddenly leaped into the public imagination onFebruary 15th 2001 when Fox television in the USA broadcast a programme calledConspiracy Theory: Did We Land on the Moon? The thrust of the show was that NASAtechnology in the 1960s was simply too primitive to have taken men to the Moon,and because they were so close to President Kennedy’s politically importantdeadline they fabricated the entire mission in a movie studio.To them the fraud was obvious. They point out that shots of the astronauts onthe lunar surface show a completely black sky without any stars. Had this provedtoo difficult for the set constructors to fake they ask? The answer is actuallyvery simple. As any proficient photographer knows, it is difficult to capturesomething extremely bright and something else extremely dim in the same shot.This means that for the stars to be visible, the lunar surface and theastronauts would have been burned out into a white blaze; the emulsion on apiece of film does not have enough dynamic range to capture both ends of thebrightness scale simultaneously.Amongst the other pieces of ‘evidence’ was the issue of the flapping flag. TheNASA set designers were apparently so dumb that they allowed a stiff breeze towaft through the studio causing the flag that the astronauts planted to waveabout. As the Moon has no atmosphere this is said to prove that it was filmed onEarth.The fact is, the flag waved about so much precisely because there was noatmosphere. When astronauts planted the flagpole they rotated it back and forthto ensure that it penetrated the lunar surface causing the flag to wobble fromside to side on its supporting frame. On Earth the presence of an atmospherequickly dampens this motion as the surrounding air absorbs the energy from themoving flag, whereas in an airless environment the flag has nothing to dampenits motion. It could therefore keep going for many hours before the energyfinally dissipated.So anyone who has seriously looked into the case for and against the actualityof the Moon landings cannot fail to reject every one of the strands of evidenceput forward by the conspiracy theorists. We do believe that conspiracies happen,because people will conspire together for all kinds of reasons – but the Apollo11 mission was certainly not one of them.We can be certain that twelve astronauts walked on the Moon between 1969 and1972 and that they brought back 842 pounds of the Moon in the form of rocks,core samples, pebbles, sand and fine dust from six different exploration sites.The last human being to walk on the Moon was Eugene Cernan in December 1972 andthe information gathered over those three years, and later by Russian unmannedcraft, has greatly increased our knowledge of the Moon. But it has also posed asmany questions as it has answered.It was expected that the samples of Moon rock would prove one of the existingtheories about the Earth–Moon system. If the rock from the samples had beensubstantially different from rocks on Earth, then it was likely that the Moonhad originated in some other part of the solar system and had been captured bythe young Earth. If the Moon was identical in every way to the Earth, then itwas likely they had both come into existence together and at the same time.However, it soon became apparent that both theories had to be wrong and nological explanation for the Moon, being what it is and where it is, exists evennow.The convoluted ‘Left hand/right hand double big whack’ theory tends to crudelyfill the void, to prevent us worrying too much about this hole in our knowledgeof our planet and its neighbour. Whilst most people believe this rather unlikelyhypothesis to be true, the people involved with developing it acknowledge thatit is improbable. All existing theories of the Moon’s origin have problems andthe University of Wisconsin has pointed out that those for the Big Whackinclude: * It requires that the entire Moon be initially molten and accreted from devolatilized material i.e. it does not account for the Moon’s lower mantle’s apparently largely undifferentiated composition. * It requires that the impactor be accreted from the same oxygen reservoir as the Earth (a previous moon of Earth?). * It does not account for a necessary density reversal below the upper mantle. * It requires that differentiation of the Earth and the impactor, and their impact, occur within the 5HF/W 55-million-year model age for the lunar magma ocean. * It does not account for the cumulative effect of many large impactors on the Moon’s non-parallel rotational axis. * It does not account for the necessary chronology of tidal separation of the Earth and moon origin of the Moon.There is also another major problem with this scenario revealed by the issue ofthe ongoing slowing down of Earth. Very precise astronomical measurements, someof them dating back to the observation of eclipses 2,500 years ago, indicatethat the day is increasing in length by about one or two thousandths of a secondper day per century. It has been thought that this tiny lengthening of the daywas entirely due to the friction of the tides caused by the Sun and the Moon.But when attempts were made to predict changes in the apparent position of theMoon on the basis of this effect alone, it was found that the calculations didnot agree with the observations at all. Another factor must be at work as well.That factor was that iron is sinking to the core of the Earth, changing themoment of inertia and thereby the length of the day. When this was taken intoconsideration and calculations were made on the basis of both the tides and thechanging moment of inertia due to sinking iron, the sums did agree with theobservations. But in order to make the calculations agree, it was necessary topostulate a flow of 50,000 tonnes of iron from the mantle to the core of theearth every second!Staggering though this volume of flow is, it would still take 500 million yearsto form the metallic core of the Earth and some calculations indicate that itmay have taken as long as two billion years. If this reasoning is correct, whichit appears to be, the Earth was made initially with large amounts of iron in itsexterior parts. As the Moon was formed at a very early stage in the Earth’sexistence (and possibly before), any material knocked off the surface by a majorimpact would contain large amounts of iron – which it does not.The Big Whack theories are simply the best of all the impossible explanationsfor the existence of the Moon.It is widely accepted that despite the intense investigation that has gone intounderstanding the Moon, and for all we know about its surface and thecomposition of its rocks, we are as much in the dark concerning its origins aswe were before the first projectile left the Earth’s atmosphere.As we have discussed, the oxygen isotope investigation proved that both Moonrocks and Earth rocks must have developed at exactly the same distance from theSun, so the Moon definitely wasn’t a captured asteroid. The Moon has its fairshare of the elements found on Earth but not in the same proportion. The Moon issubstantially lacking in heavy metals when compared with the Earth, whichaccounts for its large size but small mass.But it was the Apollo missions that identified something else that was weirdabout the Moon."},{"pageContent":"‘HOUSTON, WE’VE GOT A PROBLEM’The first two Apollo crews had landed out on the smooth lunar mare, the lavaseas that are relatively young by lunar standards, and now NASA wanted to visita site where they could study the older parts of the Moon, which meant therugged highlands. Although NASA was not ready to commit a lunar module (LM) to alanding in highly rocky terrain, the site selection committee was veryinterested in a place called the Fra Mauro Hills in the middle of the Ocean ofStorms, which seemed like a fairly smooth section of the highlands.Commander Jim Lovell along with Jack Swigert and Fred Haise were chosen for theFra Mauro mission as the crew of Apollo 13. The launch, on April 11th 1970, wentwell, allaying the worst fears of those who were concerned about a mission withthe unlucky number thirteen.Then, fifty-five hours and fifty-five minutes into the mission (and on thethirteenth day of the month) all three astronauts heard and felt what theydescribed as a ‘pretty large bang’ on board the spacecraft. The crew and theground controllers made a rapid assessment of the health of the spacecraft andit was obvious that two of the three fuel cells in the service module were dead.No one knew exactly what had gone wrong but there was no doubt that the crewwere in serious danger.To survive they needed enough power, oxygen, and water for a four-day triparound the Moon and back to Earth, and it now looked as if these commoditieswere going to be in very short supply. Oxygen and hydrogen were normallycombined in the fuel cells to produce electricity and water and both oxygentanks were rapidly losing pressure so even the remaining fuel cell wouldn’t lastlong. In addition to short supplies of these basic commodities, without power inthe command module, they would have to rely on the LM environmental controlsystem to remove excess carbon dioxide from the cabin. And to add to their manywoes, the main engine now had no power supply.However, the flight crew and ground personnel all realized just how lucky theyhad been. As desperate as the situation was, the accident had come early in themission and they still had their fully stocked lunar module as a resource. TheLM had an engine that could be used to put the crew back on a homeward path, andit carried just enough water, oxygen, and power for the four days they need tofly around the Moon and head home.As the stricken spacecraft swung behind the Moon, 164 miles above the surface,contact with the Earth was lost until it emerged on the other side and was againpicked up by tracking stations. The following words were heard: ‘The view outthere is fantastic... You can see where we’re zooming off.’At 8:09 pm EST on April 14th, Apollo 13 turned for home and the third stage ofthe Saturn V launch vehicle, weighing fifteen tonnes, was sent crashing into theMoon. As planned it struck the Moon with a force equivalent to 111⁄2 tonnes ofTNT. The impact point was eighty-five miles west-northwest of the site where theApollo 12 astronauts had set up a seismometer.NASA reports demonstrate the reaction of scientists on Earth as the Saturn V hitthe lunar surface – ‘The Moon rang like a bell.’In November 1969 the Apollo 12 crew had sent their lunar module crashing intothe Moon following their return to the command craft after their lunar landingmission. That lunar module had struck with a force of one tonne of TNT causingthe shock waves to build up to a peak in eight minutes and then continue fornearly an hour. The seismic signals produced by the impact from Apollo 13 weretwenty to thirty times greater and lasted four times longer than those resultingfrom the earlier LM crash. This time, peak intensity occurred after sevenminutes and the reverberations lasted for three hours and twenty minutes,travelling to a depth of twenty-five miles, leading to the conclusion that theMoon has an unusually light core or possibly no core at all.At the time Houston remarked to the Apollo 13 crew: ‘By the way, Aquarius, wesee the results now from 12’s seismometer. Looks like your booster just hit theMoon, and it’s rocking a little bit.’NASA reports how the information from these two artificial moonquakes led to areconsideration of theories proposed about the lunar interior. Among thepuzzling features, they say, are the rapid build-up to the peak and theprolonged reverberations, because nothing comparable happens when objects strikeEarth.When Chris was in Seattle a few years ago he had a meeting with Ken Johnston whohad worked for Brown-Root and Northrop, which was a consortium between theBrown-Root Corporation and the Northrop Corporation at the Lunar ReceivingLaboratory. The company was one of the prime contractors for NASA at the time ofthe Apollo missions and Ken was supervisor of the data and photo controldepartment. Ken told Chris that at the time of the impact created by the Apollo13 launch vehicle the scientists were not only saying that ‘the Moon rang like abell’, they also described how the whole structure of the Moon ‘wobbled’ in aprecise way, ‘almost as though it had gigantic hydraulic damper struts insideit.’This ringing effect caused many people to pick up on speculation that had beengoing on for years that the Earth’s Moon could be hollow. Back in 1962 Dr GordonMcDonald, a leading scientist at NASA, published a report in the AstronauticsMagazine where he stated that analysis of the Moon’s motion indicated that theMoon is hollow.Dr Sean C Solomon, who was Professor of Geophysics at MIT and is the Director ofthe Terrestrial Magnetism Department, Carnegie Institution of Washington as wellas the Principal Investigator for Carnegie’s research as part of the NASAAstrobiology Institute, has said: ‘The lunar orbiter experiments vastly improvedour knowledge of the moon’s gravitational field...indicating the frighteningpossibility that the moon may be hollow.’Why should this be frightening?Carl Sagan, Professor of Astronomy and Space Sciences and director of theLaboratory for Planetary Studies at Cornell University hinted at the answer whenhe said, whilst discussing the moons of Mars, that ‘It is well understood that anatural satellite cannot be a hollow object.’14The problem therefore is simple – if the Moon is hollow, someone or somethingmanufactured it.But the debate continues. A team from the University of Arizona in Tucson hasdetailed the results of their interpretation of data from the Lunar Prospectormagnetometer where they estimate that the moon does have a tiny metal core thatis roughly 420 miles (680km) across, plus or minus 112 miles (180km). Their teamleader, was Lon Hood. ‘We knew that the Moon’s core was small, but we didn’tknow it was this small,’ Hood said. ‘This really does add weight to the ideathat the Moon’s origin is unique, unlike any other terrestrial body – Earth,Venus, Mars or Mercury.’15So, it is possible that the Moon is hollow at its centre or has a very smallcore. There is also the possibility that it has voids in its make-up just as ithas the super-dense zones we call mascons. But it seems that the structure isunusual whatever the case turns out to be.The main argument against the idea of a hollow Moon that we found repeated timeand again, was that there was no theory of the Moon’s origin that could explainsuch a circumstance. The argument goes: ‘Because we can’t explain how a naturalsatellite can form with a hollow centre – it cannot have one QED.’This standpoint is fair enough – if you accept its founding premise, that theMoon is natural. And who would not make such an assumption?But as we put aside all of our preconceptions about what can and cannot be, wehave to accept that solid objects do not ring like a bell – but hollow ones do.Hollow or not, we decided to look more closely at the mechanics of the Moon."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER FIVETHE BRINGER OF LIFEWe had seen just how peculiar the Moon is, in so many ways. Our next step was tolook into how our next-door neighbour in the cosmos actually affects life onEarth.First of all we could not ignore the myth that the full Moon brings out madnessand other evils in the form of more violence, more suicides, more accidents andmore aggression – ideas that are possibly as old as history itself. The beliefthat the full Moon causes mental disorders and strange behaviour wasparticularly widespread throughout Europe in the Middle Ages.But is there any scientific evidence to support these beliefs?There have been many investigations into the subject and some have producedsurprising results. Research carried out by a medical team at a hospital inBradford, England, set out to test the hypothesis that the incidence of animalbites increases at the time of a full Moon. Using retrospective observationalanalysis at their accident and emergency department they investigated thepattern of patients who attended from 1997 to 1999 after being bitten by ananimal.The number of bites in each day was compared with the lunar phase in each monthand they found that the incidence of animal bites rose significantly at the timeof a full Moon. With the period of the full Moon as the reference point, theincidence rate ratio of the bites for all other periods of the lunar cycle wassignificantly lower. They concluded that the full Moon is associated with asignificant increase in animal bites to humans.16Of course, we must remember that correlation does not equate to causation. Thepattern they found may be a strange statistical blip or, even if it is real, itcould be entirely coincidental with the phases of the Moon. Without anysuggestion of how the Moon could cause an increase in animal aggression towardshumans, it is not possible to consider any connection as proven.Another study looked into human aggression and the lunar synodic cycle occurringin Dade County, Florida. Data on five aggressive and/or violent human behaviourswere examined to determine whether a relationship existed between the two. Theseincluded looking at the pattern of homicides, suicides, fatal traffic accidents,aggravated assaults and psychiatric emergency room visits.The team concluded that homicides and aggravated assaults demonstrated astatistically significant clustering of cases around the full Moon. Psychiatricemergency room visits clustered around the first quarter and showed asignificantly decreased frequency around new and full Moon. The suicide curveshowed correlations with both aggravated assaults and fatal traffic accidentssuggesting, they say, a self-destructive component for each of these behaviours.The existence of a biological rhythm of human aggression, which resonates withthe lunar synodic cycle was postulated.17Whilst these investigations were carried out carefully and scientifically it isimportant to remember that there are dozens of other studies that have failed toidentify similar correlations. If there is some substance behind lunar myth itis yet to be proven. However, we feel that such a relationship is not beyondreason as the Moon exerts considerable gravitational effects on the Earthcreating the tidal movements of the waters of our oceans, and humans are made upof nearly eighty per cent water. Whether or not lunar cycles affect our lives;solar ones certainly do."},{"pageContent":"THE FOUR SEASONSAt the time of writing these words the leaves on the trees here in Britain arebeginning to be tinged with brown. The days are growing shorter and the nightsare getting longer. As this happens, the average temperature each day begins tofall and much of our flora and fauna goes into a dormant state.Of course, the same seasonal change is happening all across the northernhemisphere at latitudes between the Tropic of Cancer and the Arctic Circle.Meanwhile, countries in the southern hemisphere are entering spring and newgrowth is beginning to stir as the days lengthen and the average dailytemperature increases. All of us who do not live on or near to the equator arefamiliar with the pattern of the changing seasons and the effect that thesecycles have on the way we live our lives. To our ancestors in northern parts ofEurope, Asia and America, the onset of winter must have been a time of fear anddoubt, whilst the first buds of spring would have been a merciful relief withthe signal that there would soon be fresh food to eat.What most of us don’t stop to think about is why seasons happen at all. It is acommon misunderstanding to imagine it has something to do with how close theEarth is to the Sun. It is not – it is due to the angle of the planet inrelation to the Sun, which is about 22.5 degrees from what might be described asa vertical position. The diagram below shows how the Earth would look if it wasstanding upright as it goes around the Sun, which would mean that the equator ofthe Earth would always point straight at the equator of the Sun.Figure_5.tif [../Images/00010.jpeg]Figure 5If our planet really did stand in this position, the bulge of the Sun’s equatorand that of the Earth would be closer together than the Sun’s poles and theEarth’s poles. The result of this would be a super-hot equatorial temperature onthe Earth, whilst the polar regions of the Earth would be much colder than theypresently are. Strangely enough it’s not so much a case of the difference indistance between the Earth and the Sun that matters; it is more to do with thethickness of the atmosphere above any given part of the Earth in relationship tothe direction of the Sun. In the imaginary situation above, sunlight has totravel through far more atmosphere to get to the poles of the Earth than it doesto reach the equator, thus greatly reducing the heat.Figure_6.tif [../Images/00011.jpeg]Figure 6Another important factor that reduces the heat at the poles is diminished powerdensity, where the Sun’s energy is dissipated across a greater area as the Earthcurves away from an upright position. For example, a circle of sunlight with aone-kilometre diameter will hit the Earth’s surface as a near perfect circle atthe equator, but in extreme northern or southern latitudes it will be distortedinto a long oval due to the curvature of the planet. This means that the heat ofthe sunlight at the poles will be spread over several times the area andtherefore be several times weaker.The planet Mercury is an excellent example of a world that is standing virtuallyupright, in relation to its orbit around the Sun. Apart from the fact thatlittle Mercury is so close to the Sun, its angle of inclination, or ‘obliquity’as it is more properly called, would make it a very uncomfortable place forhumans. If it were possible to stand on Mercury during one of its very shorteighty-eight-day years, the Sun would rise due east every day (which is equal tofifty-eight Earth days) at the equator and set due west. Mercury has equatorialtemperatures that would keep lead boiling, yet probes sent from Earth have shownthat the polar regions of Mercury are constantly covered in ice.So, if the Earth were in this upright mode, life would be almost impossibleacross much of the planet, with extremes of temperature providing only a narrowband suitable for mammals such as humans to survive. Even then, the sea and aircurrents would move wildly between the hot and cold zones causing catastrophicweather conditions with regions of permanent rainfall and others with none atall. Hurricanes and tornadoes would ravage many areas and overall it seemsextremely unlikely that higher life forms would ever develop on such a planet.Now consider another imaginary scenario in which the Earth is tilted on its axisa full 90 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun so that one pole facesthe Sun at all times.Figure_7.tif [../Images/00012.jpeg]Figure 7One of the poles, say the South Pole, would be permanently in daylight – stuckfor ever in a position equivalent to noon on midsummer’s day in central Africa.The Sun would blaze down from directly overhead every minute of every day! TheNorth Pole on the other hand, would be in a state of constant midnight. Indeed,all of the northern hemisphere would be in constant night and the southern inconstant day.The dark side of the planet would never warm up and it would be frozen solidwith temperatures far below anything we actually experience. The region that iscurrently between our equator and the Tropic of Capricorn would see the Suncircling right around, low on the horizon once each day. Because of the angle ofthe sunlight through the atmosphere, there would be very little warmth gettingthrough and the entire region would be covered in glaciers and swept withsnowstorms driving down from the dark northern hemisphere.Antarctica would be utterly uninhabitable, being far hotter than anywhere on ourplanet as we know it today. Only the southern tip of South America, Tasmania,New Zealand and maybe the southern section of Australia would have temperaturesthat were within a tolerable range. But it is hard to imagine what kinds ofterrible weather anyone living there would have to endure, with freezing oceancurrents moving from the north and very hot ones arriving from the south. Astate of permanent fog seems certain; which would in turn block out the Sun.If the Earth orbited the Sun in either of the two modes we have just described,there would be no seasons at all – and almost certainly no higher life forms.Thankfully we do have seasons, courtesy of the fact that the Earth is actuallyat an angle of around 22.5 degrees relative to the equator of the Sun. And thatangle is maintained by the Moon, which acts as a gigantic planetary stabilizer.Figure_8.tif [../Images/00013.jpeg]Figure 8Because of this tilt, the northern hemisphere experiences summer when the Earthis on that part of its orbit that angles it more towards, the Sun. Therefore theSun rises higher in the sky and is above the horizon longer, and the rays of theSun strike the ground more directly. Conversely, when the northern hemisphere isoriented away from the Sun, the Sun only rises low in the sky, is above thehorizon for a shorter period, and the rays of the Sun strike the ground moreobliquely.Figure_9.tif [../Images/00014.jpeg]Figure 9Whilst it is true that the extreme polar regions of the Earth are frozenthroughout the year, the tilt angle of 22.5 degrees ensures that most parts ofthe Earth’s surface get a fair share of warmth throughout each year. This inturn means that by far the vast majority of water on the surface of the planetremains in a liquid state. All of life is utterly dependent on water and cannotexist without it. The band of temperatures at which water is liquid is reallyvery narrow. The oceans of the Earth would freeze at around 1.91°C, with boilingpoint occurring at 100°C.The Earth is therefore extremely well balanced. The coldest temperature everrecorded was -89.2°C (-128.6°F) at the Vostok Station in Antarctica and thehighest was 58°C (136°F) at El Azizia in Libya. That is a range of absoluteextremes of less than 148°C, which is very little indeed in terms of the entirespectrum. The coldest anything can get is known as ‘absolute zero’ when allmolecular motion stops. This occurs at a rather chilly -273.15°C (-459.67°F).On the other hand there is no known upper limit for temperature but the hottesttemperature in our solar system is the Sun’s core, which comes in at animpressive 15,000,000°C (27,000,000°F).The normal temperature range on Earth is such that there are very few parts ofthe globe that cannot support human life. We have a normal range of bodytemperature between 36.1 to 37.8°C (97 to 100°F) and yet the Inuit people livehappily within the Arctic Circle and the Bedouin travel the deserts of NorthAfrica.The world’s average temperature fluctuates slightly around the 14.5°C (58°F)mark, which is comfortable for physical work. Of course, some people will saythat the world ‘is’ that temperature and that we would not have evolved as wehave if it were any different – but this is flawed logic. We could just as wellhave evolved in a world where only small sections of the planet were availableto us to inhabit. No other known planet has such a narrow temperature band – anda range of temperature that permits water to be liquid most of the time.In fact water is a very curious substance altogether. On Earth we can see it atthe same time in its three states – as solid ice, as liquid water and as a gasin clouds. Each water molecule is composed of just two atoms of hydrogen and oneof oxygen and yet it acts as a universal solvent with a high surface tension.Perhaps most surprising of all is how its density changes. Water has its maximumdensity at 4°C which means that it not only gets lighter as it warms from thatpoint – it also gets lighter as it cools. As everyone knows, warm water rises asconvection currents but it is also true that ice floats. Other planets in oursolar system may have ice or steam but only the Earth is awash with life-givingliquid water.Liquid water has been absolutely crucial in creating the world we know todayand, as far as is known, life cannot exist without it. As surely as platetectonics and the Earth’s hot core constantly create new mountain ranges, viavolcanoes and the pushing up of mountains as land masses meet, so water ismainly responsible for flattening them again. Constant weathering crumbles awaythe rocks as mountains age and water, in the form of rain, ice and snow, isprimarily responsible. Liquid water, as streams and rivers, also disperses theweathered rock, carrying it down to the plains where it is distributed acrossflatter land, bringing much needed nutrients to nourish life. Even morenutrients are carried by the rivers to the oceans where they offer the necessaryfood for aquatic plants that stand at the bottom of the oceanic food chain.Of course, none of this would be possible if the vast majority of water on theEarth was not in a liquid state. Only two per cent of Earth’s water is locked upin glaciers and the icecaps, with ninety-seven per cent being the water of ourseas and oceans and just one per cent available for human consumption as freshwater. With only a small change in the overall temperature of the Earth, or analteration in the seasonal patterns, the nature of the water on our planet wouldchange. As we have seen, a more pronounced planetary tilt could well lead to afreezing of the oceans. This would result in an overall loss of temperature atthe surface of the planet, with even greater freezing.On the other hand, if the Earth were not tilted at all, the equatorial regionswould become unbearably hot and weather patterns across the planet would beradically changed. In addition, the biodiversity, that scientists are nowcertain has been so important to our evolution, might never have developed in aworld with more polarized areas of temperature.It has therefore been vital for our existence that the tilt of the Earth hasbeen maintained at around 22.5 degrees for an extremely long period of time, andyet, bearing in mind the composition of the planet this is a very unlikely stateof affairs. Venus is the nearest planet to Earth and the most similar to ourown, but it has toppled over in the past and other planets in the solar systemshow signs of having varied markedly in their tilt angle across time. The Earthis very active internally and highly unstable, yet, despite a few periodicwobbles, it keeps the same angle relative to the Sun.Astronomer Jacques Laskar, a Director of Research at the National ScientificResearch Centre (CNRS) and head of a team at the Observatory of Paris is in nodoubt that the Earth would indeed topple over, if it were not for the presenceof the Moon!18With computer modelling, Laskar showed in 1993 that all the other Earth-likeplanets (Mercury, Venus and Mars) have highly unstable obliquity, which, in thecase of Mars for example, varies wildly across time between 0 degrees and 60degrees. The same computer modelling indicates that in the case of the Earth theobliquity would vary even more, between 0 degrees and 85 degrees – but for thestabilizing influence of our incredibly large Moon.Nobody knows for certain how long it would take for the Earth’s obliquity tochange significantly if the Moon was not exerting such a massive influence.There is a constant transfer of energy taking place between the two bodies,which in addition to stabilizing Earth’s obliquity has also significantly slowedour planet’s rate of spin. This constant obliquity has made the Earth a perfectcrucible for advanced life by providing many millions of years of stability forlife to develop from its simplest form to the complex patterns it adopts today.Although the Earth is significantly more massive than the Moon, the Moon isstill a very large body. Tides in Earth’s oceans, seas and lakes are caused bythe gravitational interaction of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun. Tides have aneffect on dry land as well as oceans but this effect can only be detected bycareful measurement. Solar tides (the point of greatest gravitational pull bythe Sun) are twelve hours apart but since the Moon is also moving, lunar tidesare slightly more irregular, occurring every 12.42 hours on average.The height of tides in any particular part of the ocean is dependent on a numberof factors such as the shape of any nearby landmasses and the depth of theseabed. In some areas of the world, tides hardly seem to lift the level of waterat all – this is just as well for some low-lying places such as the islands ofthe Maldives in the Indian Ocean because their average height above sea level isless than one metre. In other places, like the British coast, tides can have ahuge range between high and low water.Figure_10.tif [../Images/00015.jpeg]Figure 10The Moon has sufficient gravity to pull a bulge of water from the oceans of theEarth closest to its position towards it. It also distorts the Earth, creating acorresponding bulge in the oceans on the opposite side of the Earth. Because ofthe Earth’s rotation the bulge on the Moon side runs slightly ahead of the Moon.Tides would not cease if the Moon were not present because they are also createdby the Sun. However, they would be very much lower than they are now becausealthough the Sun is massive and the Moon much smaller, the Moon is extremelyclose and the Sun much more distant. It is the interaction of solar and lunartides that makes it rather complicated to predict when tides will occur and howhigh or low they are likely to be.The highest of the lunar tides occur when the Moon is either in its full or newmode, because at such times it is in line with the Sun and its gravitationalforces are added to those of the Sun. Much lower tides are on the first and lastquarters of the Moon when the gravity of the Moon and the Sun are workingagainst each other.Life in the tidal margins of the oceans and seas has evolved to take advantageof tides, either in a daily or a monthly sense. Some species of crabs forexample, lay their eggs in the sand at the high-water mark at the time of thefull or new Moon so that they will be safe from marine predators duringincubation. There are also many creatures that leave the ocean on the high tideat night to scavenge in the inter-tidal margins, before seeking safety with thenext high tide.Many shellfish are absolutely dependent on the ebb and flow of the tides for thepurpose of feeding and it was shown in the 1960s that oysters are sensitiveenough to be aware of the Moon’s position, either overhead or at the oppositeside of the planet. Oysters, which obviously have no eyes, were taken from theocean and placed in tanks in the Rocky Mountains where they began to open andclose, as they would have done in the ocean, had it extended so far inland.Because other stimulus such as current or wave motion were absent, it suggeststhat they are able to feel minute increases and decreases in the gravitationalpull of the Moon and the Sun.If molluscs, our very distant evolutionary cousins, can somehow sense suchastronomical movements – then there would seem to be no reason why humans wouldnot be able to do the same. This just might point the way forward ininvestigating a possible causation for variations in human behaviour accordingto the phase of the Moon.It probably is not too surprising that some creatures have learned to exploittides, which are tiny these days in comparison with the remote past when theMoon was much closer to the Earth. The tremendous forces created by a very closeMoon would have generated much heat and might even have caused parts of theEarth’s surface to melt. However, this phase did not last all that long becausethe very transfer of energy that promotes tides is also causing the Moon todrift further and further away from the Earth. This happens because the Earthrotates around its own axis more quickly than the Moon revolves around theEarth. The rapid rotation means that the tidal bulge of the Earth forward of theMoon, (see figure 11) is always ahead of the Moon’s position. The tidal bulgeexerts a pull on the Moon and this increases the Moon’s overall energy.Meanwhile, friction between the Earth’s surface and its own oceans is actuallyslowing the rate of Earth rotation. It is not much, but it does amount to around0.002 seconds in a century.The end result of this dance will be that the Moon will continue to move awayfrom the Earth until a situation of equilibrium is achieved, which is expectedto happen in about fifteen billion years. The Moon will then be 1.6 timesfurther out from the Earth than it is now and the Earth will have a solar daythat is equal to the orbit of the Moon, which by then will be fifty-five days.However, we do not have to lose too much sleep about this eventuality becausethe Sun will have become a red giant about a billion years before that, at whichtime the Earth will have ceased to exist in any case.Figure_11.tif [../Images/00016.jpeg]Figure 11As the Earth revolves, it takes the tidal bulges with it, but because of thegravity of the Moon, the water in the bulges is trying to travel in the oppositedirection. As a result, waves ground on the bottom of the oceans and onseashores, causing friction. The friction slows the Earth and the energy ispassed to the Moon, which responds by speeding up. As it does so, the laws ofphysics dictate that its orbit must widen.Over huge periods of time the relationship between the Earth and the Moonchanges, so we find ourselves living in what amounts to a ‘tiny snapshot’ of theoverall situation. At present the Moon takes 27.322 days to go around the Earthand because the Earth is also going around the Sun, full and new Moons are ruledby a slightly longer cycle that takes 29.53 days. Both these figures have beensignificantly different in the past and will be different again in the futurebut the changes are very slow and, according to NASA, the Moon is becoming moredistant from the Earth by around 3.8cm per year.Perhaps it is just as well that an expanding Sun will overtake us before theMoon does get to its final position relative to the Earth. By the time the Moonand the Earth reach their ultimate stations, the Moon will be too distant toexert enough influence on our planet to keep its obliquity steady. Bearing inmind the Earth’s unstable core, this would almost certainly mean rapid andperhaps catastrophic changes in both obliquity and climate.Neil F Comins, Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Maine,has written about the consequences if the Moon did not exist. He explains thatthe Earth would be turning so fast that a day would take just eight hours andcomplex life would not exist yet. If higher life forms did eventually manage toevolve, such creatures would be very different to us without, for example, anycommunication through speech.19One thing is certain then: no Moon would mean no humans!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SIXTHE LIVING EARTHHumans are incredibly robust creatures considering we are little more thananimated bags of water hanging on a mineral frame. We can withstand difficultconditions and even survive without food for many weeks, yet we die quicklywithout air to breath or with direct exposure to unusually high or lowtemperatures. It is thanks to eons of Darwinian evolution that we are perfectlydesigned for our environment – but perhaps we should not be too casual about theextraordinary good fortune that brought us to this point.Every human is very special. We differ from other creatures, so we are told,because we are able to define ourselves by our own self-awareness resulting in asituation where there is a simple polarity to the Universe. We all know that:‘There is me and then there is everything else.’ Each and every one of us is anemotional-intellectual island connected to that ‘everything else’ by the complexinteraction of our five senses.Two small regions of our skin have developed the ability to decode energyreflections in the form of sight, two more make sense of a cacophony ofcolliding compression waves in the gases around us giving us hearing. Then wehave skin sensitive enough to tell us about shape and texture, a mouth thataccurately differentiates between different chemical substances we are about toconsume in the form of taste and we have an air inlet that can pick out thepresence of a specific molecule within a million others in the atmosphere as thesense we call smell.These five connection modes cause us to have interaction with the ‘everythingelse’ – especially other humans, so we do not exist alone. These points ofstimulus combine to give life to the most remarkable array of aspects of self.Love, fear, loathing, compassion, laughter and countless other emotions make usspecial and mark us out as entities that are utterly different to the rest ofcreation.But how and why have we become so spectacularly differentiated from othercombinations of recycled stardust? What makes Neil Armstrong more special thanthe 3.5-billion-year-old rock he first lifted from the lunar surface?Those with religious faith turn to their interpretation of God to explain theunexplainable and the more scientific amongst us turns to the AnthropicPrinciple. The good old ‘Anthropic Principle’ is less there to help us answerthe BIG question than to avoid having to deal with it. It accepts thevanishingly tiny probability of human existence by stating that the rules of theUniverse that produced us have to be exactly as they are or we would not be hereto perceive them.To us, this is rather like defining moving, emotionally stimulating music bymerely expressing it as ‘music that is good’. The statement is correct but itdoes not compare with the experience!What the Anthropic Principle does is to stop us worrying too much about the factthat we really have no right to exist. Of the two approaches, anthropic ordivine, at least the God scenario is an attempt to move the problem on a notchrather than utilizing a principle that seems to have been conceived to ignoreit.Most scientifically minded people probably subscribe to the theory that humans,like everything else, are the product of billions of years of random chance.However, the most famous scientist of all time, Albert Einstein, was veryunhappy about nature being based on randomness. He said about quantum physics:‘God does not play dice.’The more we looked into how our planet developed into a paradise for livingcreatures the more surprised we became. The miracle of life on Earth is due toour narrow temperature band that provides us with liquid water and, as we haveexplained, it is the Moon that is responsible for maintaining the perfect tiltthat provides our benign climate. But amazingly, it was the very act of theMoon’s creation that produced the first link in the chain of events that wouldlead the Universe to make you!In 1911 a brilliant young scientist by the name of Alfred Lothar Wegener wasbrowsing through the library of his university in Marburg, Germany, when he cameacross a scientific paper that listed a host of identical plant and animalspecies that could be found on opposite sides of the Atlantic. Although havingobtained a PhD in astronomy at a very early age, Wegener was particularlyinterested in geophysics, a field of study that was in its infancy at the time.Something in the paper caught Wegener’s imagination and he began to spend timelooking for other examples of similar plants and creatures separated by oceans.There was, at the time, no reasonable explanation as to how such a state ofaffairs could have come about. It had been postulated that the solution to thispuzzle had to be land bridges that must have existed in very ancient times andthat had allowed both plants and animals to move between continents. However,there were many examples that could not be explained in this way.Wegener had also noted, as had others before him, how many cases there were inwhich the coastline of one continent looked as though it could fit snugly intothat of another, such as the west coast of Africa and the east coast of SouthAmerica. He also found that if the continental shelf is studied, rather than theapparent coastline shaped by current sea level, the fit is often very muchbetter.Alfred Wegener began to ask himself if the answer to these anomalies might lienot in land bridges but in the fact that the continents were once joinedtogether in one large continent, and that this had somehow broken up and driftedapart. Later in his life he wrote about this process of logical deduction. ‘Aconviction of the fundamental soundness of the idea took root in my mind.’Wegener spent a considerable period collecting further examples of extendedflora and fauna and the available evidence continued to support his earlytheory. For example, he found the fossils of plants and creatures in placeswhere the climate must have been significantly different when they were aliveand flourishing, such as fossilized cycads – ancient tropical plants found asfar away from the tropics as Spitsbergen in the Arctic.From the weight of evidence he had collected, Wegener deduced that all thecontinents had once been part of a single landmass, which he chose to call‘Pangaea’ – a Greek word meaning ‘all the Earth’. He suggested that thissuper-continent had broken up and had begun to drift apart 300 million yearsago. He called the process ‘Continental Drift’ and although he wasn’t the firstto suggest that there had originally been a single continent, he was able toprovide substantial evidence to back up the claim. Wegener first published hisfindings and his hypothesis in his book The Origin of Continents and Oceans.20Although it was brilliantly argued, his ideas were not widely accepted at thetime.A flood of scientific indignation broke over Alfred Wegener. This happened for acouple of reasons: firstly, his theory was revolutionary, which inevitablyclashed with the conservative tendencies of other experts; and in addition,although Wegener was certain that continental drift must have taken place, hehad no theory as to how or why this might have happened. The best he couldsuggest was that the continents, influenced by centrifugal and tidal forces asthe Earth spun on its axis, were simply ploughing their way across the surfaceof the planet.Dissenters pointed out that, if this was the case, the coastlines of thecontinents could hardly be expected to have remained so similar to the original‘fit’ that it could still be observed. On the contrary, they would have beendistorted beyond recognition. It was also suggested that tidal and centrifugalforces would be far too weak to move entire continents.Poor Alfred Wegener didn’t have the chance to look too much further into thematter; he died in 1930 whilst taking part in a rescue mission to deliver foodto a party of explorers and scientists trapped in Greenland.Wegener did have some notable supporters but in general his ideas remained onthe shelf until as recently as the 1950s, by which time greater exploration andunderstanding of the Earth’s geophysical makeup had begun to catch up with theidea of continental drift. The truth of the matter is that Wegener was wrong interms of his suggested mechanism, but quite correct in his basic assumption.Rather than ploughing their way across the planet’s surface, the continents‘float’ on what is known as the ‘asthenosphere’, the underlying rock of ourplanet. This is under so much pressure and becomes so incredibly hot that itacts more like thick treacle than solid rock.Figure_12.tif [../Images/00017.jpeg]Figure 12One of the factors that made Wegener’s ideas more acceptable was the study ofmountain ranges. An earlier position held by many experts had been the‘contraction theory’. This suggested that the Earth had begun its life as amolten ball and that as it cooled it had cracked and folded up on itself. Thisfolding, the theory suggested, was what had created mountain ranges. The realproblem with the contraction theory was that all mountain ranges shouldtherefore be of the same age and it was rapidly becoming apparent that thiscould not be the case. Wegener had suggested that mountains were constantlybeing created as landmasses came into contact, exerting unbelievable pressureand pushing up land at or close to the points of contact.Just a year before Alfred Wegener’s death some corroborative evidence had beenforthcoming, but it wasn’t well accepted at the time. In 1929 Arthur Holmes, aphysicist at the Imperial College of Science in London suggested that the mantleof the Earth undergoes ‘thermal convection’. The Earth’s mantle is that regionimmediately below the outer crust. It extends all the way down to the Earth’score. Its composition varies with increased pressure and temperature but itmakes up the biggest part of the Earth.Holmes knew that when a substance is heated, its density decreases. In the caseof the mantle this would cause material to rise to the surface where it wouldgradually cool, become denser and then sink again. A similar process takes placewith porridge that is boiling in a saucepan. Holmes was quite taken withWegener’s idea of continental drift and suggested that the tremendous pressurescaused by thermal convection could act like a conveyor belt. This might causethe continents to break apart and to be ‘carried’ across the surface of theplanet.For years these ideas were dismissed, until knowledge caught up with thetheories. By the 1960s there was a greater understanding of the ‘oceanicridges’–regions where, it was being realized, Holmes’ thermal convection mightactually be taking place. It was also realized that oceanic trenches occurred,together with arcs of islands, close to the continental margins. All of thismeant that convection was not only probable but certain. Two other scientists, RDeitz in 1961 and Harry Hess in 1962 separately published similar hypothesesbased on mantle convection currents, and continental drift became universallyaccepted.Deitz and Hess between them modified Holmes’ original theory of convection andcame eventually to their own mechanism for continental drift, which is based onwhat they termed ‘seafloor spreading’. This spreading, it is suggested, beginsin the mid-oceanic ridges. These are huge mountain ranges in the middle of theEarth’s largest oceans. So large are the mid-oceanic ridges that they are higherthan the Himalayas and are more than 2,000 kilometres wide. Associated with theridges are great trenches that bisect the length of the ridges and which can beas deep as 2,000 metres. The greatest heat flow from the ocean floor takes placenear the summit of the mid-oceanic ridges. There are also far more earthquakeson and around the ridges than are experienced elsewhere, showing these to begeologically active areas.An increase in understanding of the Earth’s magnetic field led to therealization that periodically this reverses. Such fluctuations can be detectedwith a device called a magnetometer. It was discovered that, either side of themid-oceanic ridges, it was possible to detect these past reversals in theEarth’s magnetic field. The conclusion was that new material was constantlybeing thrown up on the ridges and was being pushed outwards on either side. Thereversals of the magnetic field demonstrated that this process was ancient butthat it was still taking place.Also of interest were ‘deep-Sea trenches’. The trenches are generally long andnarrow and they are often associated with, and parallel to, continental mountainranges. In addition they run parallel to the ocean margins. There is greatseismic activity associated with the deep-sea trenches, indicating that they tooare associated with the process of seafloor spreading and that they are directlyrelated to the oceanic-ridges.What is now thought to be happening is as follows: underneath the Earth’s outercrust is the asthenosphere. This is a malleable layer of heated rock. It is kepthot because of radioactive decay in elements such as uranium. The source for theradioactivity, which also includes thorium and potassium, lies deep within theplanet. The asthenosphere, constantly heated, rises to the surface, pushing newmaterial out at the mid-oceanic ridges. Magma escapes along the cracks formed atthe ridges, forcing the new seafloor in different directions. The new materialspreads outwards until it makes contact with a continental plate and will thenbe ‘subducted’ beneath the continent. The lithosphere at this point sinks backinto the asthenosphere, where it once again becomes heated.Few experts disagree with this basic explanation, partly because it can be seenat work. India, for example, started its life on a completely different part ofthe planet. It is now being forced up into the body of Asia and the Himalayasare the result – a huge mountain range forced up by the pressure of the twolandmasses meeting.The whole process is known as plate tectonics and scientists were keen to seewhether or not a similar process was taking place on the other terrestrial–typeplanets in our solar system – Mercury, Venus and Mars. Probes sent to theseplanets have now shown conclusively that plate tectonics do not take place onany of our companion worlds, making it a strictly Earth-bound phenomenon, atleast as far as our own solar system is concerned.This is something of a puzzle. What is taking place in the Earth system that isso different from the other Earth-like planets? What caused plate tectonics tocommence in the first place and what is the engine that keeps driving theprocess? There is a growing body of evidence to show that in both cases theanswer is almost certainly the Moon. What is more, it is now being suggestedthat without plate tectonics the Earth may not have proved to be a suitablehaven for life at all.Dr Nick Hoffman, a geophysicist at the Department of Earth Sciences, MelbourneUniversity, Australia, has recently suggested that the Moon made plate tectonicshappen simply by coming into existence.As we have discussed, the origin of the Moon is still shrouded in mystery, nomatter how much proponents of any specific theory of its origin may pretend.However, there are certain facts that are known for sure. As we have seen, theMoon is definitely made of the same stuff as the Earth, but not all of theEarth. Rather the composition of the Moon closely resembles the material in theEarth’s crust, without many of the heavier components, such as iron, that makeup the Earth’s core.But how could such a large amount of the Earth leap from the planet’s surfaceinto a position tens of thousands of miles in space?Scientists were puzzled. And then a potential explanation was put forward in theform of the original Big Whack theory – the suggestion that maybe some object,about the size of Mars, collided with the young Earth and that the Moon wasformed from surface material that was blasted off the face of the infant Earth.There did not seem to be any other possibility, so it is now regularly taught asthough it is a fact. The major problem of the Earth’s current speed of rotationwas tentatively explained away by proposing a second impact from the oppositedirection occurring quite soon after the first.To us this sounds like a rather desperate scenario to believe in. And as we haveseen, other problems remain for this would-be explanation; not least thequestion of where the material from the incoming objects went to. If the DoubleWhack theory as correct, the Moon should be made up of three different sets ofmaterial, but it is not. It is made of Earth rock alone.Nick Hoffman, as an acclaimed expert on the terrestrial planets within our solarsystem, has suggested that the removal of the material that went to make theMoon may have triggered plate tectonics by creating the space for the planet’sskin to shift. He points out that on Venus, for example, the same sort of forcesare at work but the crust of the planet is so thick, the stresses within thecrust simply cancel each other out, with the exception of a few wrinkles hereand there. Hoffman has noted that if the seventy per cent of Earth crust thatwas destined to become the Moon was returned to the Earth, it would ‘fill theocean basins with wall-to-wall continent’.What would the Earth be like without plate tectonics?Hoffman suggests it would be a water world, covered with oceans and with onlythe tips of extremely high mountain ranges poking out above the surface of thewater. Of course there is nothing to suggest that life could not have existed onsuch a planet and Hoffman agrees that life is most likely to develop in a wateryenvironment. It’s a fact, though, that what we term as being ‘intelligent life’,such as our own species, has developed on land. The use of fire would not bepossible in a watery habitat and the use of tools, one of the factors that isgenerally accepted as the starting point of our advance, is also a dry landphenomenon.In any case, as we will see, the Moon is so important in other ways that even awatery world may have proved to be impossible without its existence."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER SEVENTHE INCUBATOR OF INTELLIGENCENick Hoffman’s suggestion that the creation of the Moon removed so much materialfrom the surface of the Earth that plate tectonics could become a reality isfascinating. It is estimated that seventy per cent of the primordial crust ofthe Earth would be necessary in order to create the Moon. Its removal caused theremainder of the crust to spread, allowing continental drift to take place.Whether or not this is the whole story, plate tectonics are a reality as far asthe Earth is concerned and what is more, it is a phenomenon that only occurs onthe Earth. In other words, no other terrestrial- type body in the solar systemhad continents travelling about its surface.One of the three Earth-like planets in the solar system, apart from the Earthitself, is Mars, which is half the size and a tenth the mass of our planet. Ithas an atmosphere that is ninety-five per cent carbon dioxide and nearly fiveper cent nitrogen with a pressure at the surface that is only 1/200th that ofEarth. Unfortunately for any potential Martian life form, liquid water cannotexist at the ambient pressure and at the temperature of the Martian surface. Onthis planet, water goes directly between solid and vapour phases withoutbecoming liquid at all.The puzzle as to why plate tectonics have either never started or else neverbeen maintained on Mars has not been totally explained, but there are theories.Mars has no appreciable mountain ranges, though it does have giant volcanoes.Some geologists suggest that the absence of true mountain ranges gives one clueas to why Mars did not develop plate tectonics. Like Earth, Mars has alithosphere. This is a region in the crust of the planet that is cooler than itsinterior – a little like the skin that forms on a cup of hot milk. The centre ofthe Earth is extremely hot, probably more so than that of Mars, but the presenceof volcanoes on Mars must indicate a hot core. One difference might be that Marshas nowhere near as much water in its composition as Earth. It is thought thatit is water trapped within the Earth which acts as a lubricant allowingdifferent parts of its rocky surface to slide against each other. The limitedamount of water on Mars seems to prevent the lithosphere from allowing freshmaterial from deep within the planet to rise to the surface in the way it isconstantly doing on Earth. As a result the lithosphere has not been disturbedfor aeons and has cooled gradually, getting thicker and thicker. When pressurehas become so great within the body of Mars that it is powerful enough toescape, it has done so via volcanism and not along features like the mid-oceanicridges on Earth.The other Earth-like body, Venus, which orbits closer to the Sun than our ownplanet, has a surface very different to that of Mars or the Earth. In some waysVenus is more like Earth than Mars. Venus is a similar size and mass and is alsocompositionally quite like Earth – or at least it was once. Experts such asDavid Grinspoon, a research scientist at Southwest Research Institute inBoulder, Colorado, have studied Venus closely, aided by a whole series oforbital and lander space missions.Grinspoon is not alone in believing that in its early stages of developmentVenus was even more like the Earth. There is no discernable water on Venus nowbut there are traces in the atmosphere, which most likely indicates that in itsvery early stages it had proportionally as much water as Earth. This is not toosurprising because the planets formed at the same time and fairly closetogether.Venus is not unlike Mars in many ways but its surface pressure is ninety-twotimes that of Earth. It is thought that Venus lost its water because of agreenhouse effect and it is now covered in dense swirling clouds of sulphuricacid. These clouds are so thick that only a small percentage of the sunlightthat falls on Venus actually gets through to the planet’s surface, so even if itweren’t such a hell in other ways, it would be a very gloomy world. It might bethought that less sunlight would lead to a lower temperature but this isn’t thecase. Rather, heat already at or near the surface is maintained and increasedbecause it cannot escape through the dense carbon dioxide. This has caused adramatic heating of the surface of Venus to a present temperature of 730°C.Like Mars and Earth, Venus has volcanoes; in fact it has more than any otherplanet in the solar system. But again, like Mars, the volcanoes of Venus existas individual entities and not as part of long mountain ranges as is the case onEarth. The volcanoes of Venus are randomly spread about its surface and many ofthem look very recent, even though this may not be the case. Electrical stormsrage constantly through the clouds of sulphuric acid but, even so, wind erosionon Venus is limited compared to the water-rich Earth. It turns out that erosionis extremely important in terms of supplying the right chemical and nutrientbalances that have made the Earth a haven for life.The surface of Venus looks broadly similar wherever one looks and is thought tobe comparatively recent in origin – something in the order of 600 to 700 millionyears. Venus has a generally smooth surface with some rifts and folds buteverything appears to be the same age. It is generally accepted that between 600and 700 million years ago some cataclysm took place on Venus that remodelled itswhole surface. Whether this was as a result of the internal stresses within theplanet is not known, but for some reason the planet’s surface appears to haveliterally melted or more likely was uniformly covered with volcanic basalt.Nobody knows for certain whether a similar thing will happen again on Venus, inother words whether we are seeing only one phase of a stop-start process that istaking place, but it is considered to be a distinct possibility. Probablybecause of its greenhouse atmosphere Venus is deficient in water and so onceagain may have built up a thick lithosphere. It certainly does not display anyof the characteristics of plate tectonics.It is interesting to note that Venus has no moons, whilst Mars has two, thoughboth of these are extremely small and can have little or no effect on their hostplanet. As we have seen, it is now being suggested that the very creation ofsuch a large moon as that enjoyed by Earth was directly responsible for thestart of plate tectonics, which in turn allowed life to form on the planet inthe first place.In the early stages of its existence, the Moon was very much closer to the Earththan it is today. And it is the existence of the Earth’s oceans that isprimarily responsible for the gradual lengthening of the distance between theEarth and the Moon. This is a process that has been taking place for the lastfour billion years and which is still taking place.One way of looking at the situation was presented by Neil F Comins, Professor ofAstronomy at the University of Maine. Back in 1990 he had been struck by thecomments of a colleague, to the effect that science educators are always lookingat the world from the same old perspective. Comins suggested that it might besensible to step aside and look at the world differently.As a result of this conversation Comins decided to turn his attention tosomething we all take for granted, namely the Earth and its relationship to theMoon – but from an entirely different perspective. He set out to consider whatthe Earth would have been like today if it had not enjoyed the benefits of solarge a Moon. He called his hypothetical world ‘Solon’ and over a period of timehe wrote a series of articles about Solon that appeared in Astronomy magazine.He eventually published his overall observations in a book, which was entitledVoyages to Earth that Might Have Been.21Comins examined every aspect of the Earth and its relationship with the Moon tobuild a picture of a similar planet, at the same distance from the Sun and whichwas the same age as Earth. The only thing that was different is that the Moondid not exist, but the alterations this absence would make to the Earth weredramatic.Nick Hoffman suggests that the very nature of the Earth’s surface would havebeen entirely different if the material that makes up the Moon had not beenremoved from the Earth’s crust. However, Comins’ starting point is to assumethat the surface details of the Earth would be roughly the same as they are now.One of the greatest differences in terms of the early, developing Earth wouldhave been tides. Comins makes the point that a Moon ten times as close wouldhave led to daily lunar tides that would have been a thousand times greater thanthey are today. Bearing in mind that it is generally accepted that the infantEarth was spinning about its centre every six hours, this means thattsunami-strength tides would have been hurtling across the Earth every threehours! Not only were these tides more frequent, but, being so very much larger,they would have crashed many hundreds of kilometres inland – and with tremendousdestructive force.The mechanism that has slowed the Earth’s spin is directly related to tides andthe Moon is not the only body responsible for them because part of the oceantides on the Earth are responsive to the Sun. But the Moon is much closer andhas done far more to slow the Earth than has the more distant Sun. Cominsestimates that without the Moon, the Earth day would be only eight hours inlength and solar generated tides alone would be less than a third of what theyare today.The immediate implication has great ramifications on the possibility of evolvinglife. At present many scientists accept that DNA, the fundamental building blockof all life, occurred spontaneously in Earth’s early oceans. We will have muchmore to say about DNA later, but for the moment we will accept the general viewthat it first appeared in the early oceans of the Earth, a legacy of what isknown as the ‘primeval soup – a specific blend of water and chemicals upon whichlife depends.The massive tides created by the infant Moon would have caused erosion on ascale quite beyond our experience today. Millions upon millions of tonnes ofland would have been pulverized and swept out to sea, then widely distributedand eventually settled on the seabed. This process liberated vast amounts ofminerals into the oceans – minerals that emerging life simply could not dowithout. Presumably a Moonless world would still have had weather patterns,including rain, so erosion would have taken place but on a tiny scale comparedwith what happened when the Moon was so much closer to the Earth. This meansthat life would have taken much longer to gain a foothold, if it had managed todo so at all.We have no problem with the concept that life first developed and flourished inthe ocean, but there had to be a time at which it migrated from its saltyenvirons and learned to survive on dry land. It is possible that insect lifetook the leap first but the fish ancestors of amphibians and reptiles followedand between them they eventually gave way to all land-living animals in theworld today.Life is always evolving to harmonize with the prevailing environment and tocapitalize on new niches that are not already being exploited. Around 400million years ago one such area of potential exploitation was rock-pools. Fishare accidentally left behind in rock pools with every retreating tide, both thenand now. In most cases it doesn’t matter because the next high tide will freethe fish again, back into the sea. However, if a fish is isolated in a rock poolduring a particularly high tide, it may have to survive for weeks before it willbe liberated. Fish that found themselves in this situation would die unless theysomehow managed to get back to the ocean by moving over dry land and alsomanaging to breathe out of the water.It seems that some fish did find ways to drag themselves across the sand, at thesame time changing enough physically to take gulps of air whilst out of thewater. These fish found that dry land offered some rich pickings and any animalthat learned to live, even temporarily, on dry land, would be well rewarded.Gradually, and over a long period of time, fins that pushed the fish over sandbecame stouter until they became legs and the fish in question ceased to be fishat all.Since the Sun also creates tides it isn’t out of the question that fish wouldultimately have left the oceans, even if lunar tides had not been present.However, the waves in question would have been significantly smaller and theirvalue in terms of depositing detritus much more limited. What is quite clear isthat life would also have been very much slower in developing to a stageadvanced enough to leave the oceans had it not been for the lunar tides, if itcould ever have happened at all. When we take on board the prospect of an Earthwith a variable obliquity, no plate tectonics and such a dizzying spin about itsaxis, the prognosis for life of any sort on Comins’ Solon is not good.Fortunately for us the Moon was present and stamped its authority on thedeveloping Earth in a number of different but equally crucial ways. It helped tocreate many differing habitats, which in turn engendered biodiversity. Mostexperts believe that it was biodiversity that led to intelligent life becomingpossible. Evolution tries and retries many different models. Animals that wereideally suited to their environment flourished on the Earth, only to fall by thewayside when conditions changed and they could not adapt.Giant reptiles, that we generically call ‘dinosaurs’, ruled the Earth formillions of years until these impressive and diverse creatures vanished from theface of the planet. Whether as a result of some cataclysm, such as a hugemeteorite strike, or thanks to some other misfortune, species that hadflourished for eons were wiped out astonishingly quickly, but life itselfremained untouched. Such was the multiplicity of species already inhabiting theEarth that some were bound to overcome the problems that put paid to thousandsof others at a stroke.One of the animals that did survive whatever circumstances put paid to thedinosaurs was a tiny shrew-like creature that occupied the vacant niche left bythe demise of the reptiles. However, it was different to the reptiles because itgave birth to live young and suckled its infants with milk created from its ownbody. These first mammals then evolved to diversify and spread across the planetwhere they have been adaptable enough to survive and flourish.Tree-dwelling species became monkeys and some of these creatures came down fromthe trees and began to move across the open savannah, most likely created by yetmore climatic changes. Down on the ground these anthropoids were vulnerable. Ifthey were going to survive they were going to need something that had not beenspecifically necessary to earlier creatures.They needed bigger brains.Evolution responded and a whole family of hominids was the result, of which Homosapiens is now the only surviving example. But despite our general sense ofspecialness, recent events point to our solus position as being surprisinglyrecent.One of the greatest breakthroughs for humans was the control of fire; but theearliest known evidence of regular fire using is unequivocally attributed to ourlarger-brained cousins, the Neanderthals, some 200,000 years ago. We coexistedwith these people until they finally disappeared in southern Europe around25,000 years ago. Science had believed that an earlier hominid, Homo erectus,had become extinct hundreds of thousands of years ago, until the mid-1990s whenremains found on the island of Java in Indonesia were found to indicate thatthey too were around until 25,000 years ago.Both these alternative humans disappeared at a time when midsummer’s day fellaround June 21st in the northern hemisphere – just as it does today. The dateson which astronomical events such as the summer and winter solstices and thespring and autumn equinoxes fall, move backwards through the calendar by one day(around one Megalithic degree) every seventy-one years. This is due to the long,slow wobble of the Earth on its axis, known as ‘the precession of the equinoxes’which takes 25,920 years for each cycle.This movement through the calendar has no effect on people at all, but it isinteresting to note that a recent discovery suggests we were not alone as aspecies as recently as 13,000 years ago, when the summer solstice in thenorthern hemisphere fell in late December; the exact opposite of where it isright now.The discovery of what is claimed to be a previously unknown branch of hominidoccurred on the island of Flores, near Java, and was announced to the world in2004. Remains have been found of a dwarf hominid, named Homo floresiensis, whichwas only as tall as a modern three-year-old with a facial morphology verydifferent to Homo sapiens. Strangely, these miniature people had mini-brains yetthey produced relatively sophisticated tools.Not only have we recently shared the planet with other hominids, it now seemsthat the ancestors of today’s Europeans may have interbred with other types ofhuman in the not too distant past.As part of a large-scale gene-mapping programme, researchers at deCODE Geneticsin Reykjavik, Iceland, were looking at the families of nearly 30,000 Icelanders.They found that women who had an inversion on chromosome 17 had, on average, 3.5per cent more children than women who did not. Kari Stefansson, deCODE’s chiefexecutive, considered this to be a very significant impact in terms of anevolutionary timescale. It is possible to roughly date the origin of thisphenomenon by counting the number of genetic differences that have accumulatedin it compared to a normal DNA sequence. It turns out that this element has somany differences that it must have occurred about three million years ago. Whichis long before modern humans evolved.Stefansson has suggested that this element of the DNA might have been native tosome other species of early human and came to our own species around 50,000years ago. He added: ‘There aren’t all that many ways you can explain it exceptby the reintroduction into the modern human population… That raises thepossibility it was reintroduced by cross-breeding with earlier species.’22But as these other humans disappeared, Homo sapiens developed a growingintelligence that allowed us to begin to manipulate the environment in which welive. The great breakthrough was the development of agriculture – a move thatallowed civilization to emerge.With civilization came the ability to count and ultimately a way of expressinglanguage in a written form. Knowledge that had once been laboriously passed fromone generation to the next could now be stored and retrieved from places outsidethe human brain. Intelligence also created technology and a great desire tounderstand the workings of the world and the cosmos of which it was part. Butthis curiosity began long before we sent representatives of our species to walkon the Moon. It had been present for more than 30,000 years, when the firstlunar calendars were created. It is almost certain that after the Sun, the Moonwas the most important heavenly body to captivate our species.How little those cave dwellers, who scratched their knowledge of the lunar cycleonto animal bones and antlers, were aware that without the presence of the lunardisc that so captivated them, the Earth would probably be a lifeless rock,silently spinning around the Sun, like the inferno of Venus and the frozenwastes of Mars."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER EIGHTEXTERNAL INTELLIGENCE‘Rather than transmitting radio messages, extraterrestrial civilizations wouldfind it far more efficient to send us a “message in a bottle”, some kind ofphysical message inscribed on matter. And it could be waiting for us in our ownbackyard.’Professor Christopher Rose of Rutgers University, New Jersey & Gregory Wright, aphysicist with Antiope Associates, New JerseyThe idea that intelligent life forms might exist elsewhere in the cosmos is acomparatively recent interest for humanity. For thousands of years and acrosscountless cultures, it was more or less accepted that anything dwelling outsideour own immediate environment inevitably fell into the classification of a godor a servant of the gods, such as the saints, angels or seraphim that inhabitthe heaven of the Judeo-Christian tradition.Even after the telescope appeared, around the year 1600, the Catholic Church inparticular was not keen to have its dogmas regarding the nature of the Earth andits relationship with space tampered with in any way. In Christian doctrine, theSun and the Moon have both been directly created by God, as have the stars andplanets. The first book of the Bible, Genesis, lay down the order in which Godcreated the observable cosmos and anyone who seemed to be throwing a spanner inthe works, for example Galileo (1564–1642) who suggested that the Sun, and notthe Earth, was the centre of the solar system, was liable to be severelycensured. Galileo was forced to recant his heretical views and was condemned toperpetual house arrest but was probably lucky to escape with his life.Even before Galileo’s time, thinking people were not fooled by the Church’saccount of the solar system. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan(1480–1521) understood what he was seeing at the time of a lunar eclipse: ‘Thechurch says the earth is flat, but I know it is round for I have seen its shadowon the moon and I have more faith in a shadow than the church.’Only the effects of the Renaissance and Church reformations across Europe brokethe hold of old church dogma. By the late seventeenth century, with telescopesproliferating and almost anyone able to take a close-up view of the Sun, Moon,planets and stars, the cat was truly out of the bag and the genuine nature ofthe solar system in particular was beginning to become apparent.Since Charles Darwin wrote The Origin of Species in the mid-nineteenth centuryit has become clear that life on Earth has evolved over billions of years fromthe first single-cell entities through to all of the creatures in the worldtoday. Darwin’s ideas were argued over fiercely at the time, but the massingevidence from palaeontology, genetics, zoology, molecular biology and many otherfields gradually established evolution’s truth beyond reasonable doubt.It is ironic, therefore, that the most scientifically advanced nation the worldhas ever known, the United States, has large numbers of ‘Creationists’ – peoplewho still cling to the teachings of the mediaeval Church. They are currentlytrying to persuade politicians, judges and the general public that evolution isan unproven myth cobbled together by atheists. They lobby for their ideas, suchas ‘intelligent design’, to be taught as alternatives to evolution in scienceclassrooms. Their proponents admit that their aim is to keep the scriptures ofthe Christian religion taught in school as the word of God, rather than acollection of ancient Jewish texts.Their arguments against Darwin’s concept of ‘natural selection’ are not wellreasoned or based on any normal principle of modern science. These people appearto be intellectually stuck, hundreds of years in the past, at a time beforemasses of new data became available. However, it is interesting to note thatacademics once thought like this too. Dr John Lightfoot, the Vice-chancellor ofthe University of Cambridge was not frightened of being precise about the originof the entire Universe when he said in 1642:‘Heaven and earth, centre and circumference, were created together, in the sameinstant, and clouds of water... This work took place and man was created... onthe 17th of September 3928 BC at nine o’clock in the morning.’Poor Dr Lightfoot seems to have been ignorant of even the most basic facts ofscience. He clearly did not realize that there is no such thing as nine o’clockin the morning because every hour of the day exists simultaneously on ourrevolving planet; it just depends where you are standing. Happily, the very yearthat Lightfoot made this statement, a baby boy was born in the village ofWoolsthorpe in Leicestershire. The infant’s name was Isaac Newton and he went onto become Cambridge University’s most famous professor and a man that wouldcreate a leap forward in humankind’s understanding of the Universe.Newton however, did not dismiss the role of God as he wrote on Judaeo-Christianprophecy, the decipherment of which he saw as being essential to theunderstanding of God. His book on the subject espoused his view thatChristianity had gone astray in 325 AD, when the crumbling Roman Empire declaredthat Jesus Christ was not a man but an aspect of the very deity that had builtthe Universe.Today we have the benefit of masses of data from all kinds of disciplines thatpoint to the Earth being nearly five billion years old, but many creationistsfrequently quote the chronology produced by James Ussher who was Archbishop ofArmagh and Primate of All Ireland in the early seventeenth century. Hisanalysis, based on his interpretation of the King James Bible, allowed him toconfidently declare that the creation of the world occurred in 4004 BC.Such a dating raises all kinds of problems, from fitting in the obviousexistence of dinosaurs, for example, to the fact that the city of Jericho, nearto the River Jordan, has been continuously occupied for 10,000 years.(Interestingly, the origin of the name ‘Jericho’ is Canaanite and means ‘theMoon’).There are creationist websites that put forward ‘evidence’ that their writersbelieve demonstrates that people and dinosaurs lived at the same time –presumably around the time that the Megalithic Yard was being introduced! Butthese are not fringe ideas as there are large numbers of people who believe thatgeological time is a myth. According to a survey run by the Gallup Organizationin 1999, the majority of Americans educated up to high school level or less,believe that God created humans in their present form within the past 10,000years or so. And a worrying forty-four per cent of college graduates believe thesame.An international research team led by scientists at the University of BritishColumbia sees the creation as being a little earlier than Dr Lightfoot andArchbishop Ussher. Professor Harvey Richer, the study’s principal investigator,confirmed previous research that sets the age of the Universe at thirteen tofourteen billion years. The team measured the brightness and temperatures ofwhite dwarf stars (the burned-out remnants of the earliest stars which formed inour galaxy) because they are ‘cosmic clocks’ that get fainter as they cool in avery predictable way.More recent calculations, by Lawrence Krauss of Case Western Reserve Universityand Brian Chaboyer at Dartmouth College, published in the journal Science, putthe Universe at anything up to twenty billion years old.Creationists often try to invalidate all of evolution by pointing to science’scurrent inability to explain the origin of life. John Rennie, the editor inchief of Scientific American has countered this by saying:‘…even if life on Earth turned out to have a non-evolutionary origin (forinstance, if alien’s introduced the first cells billions of years ago),evolution since then would be robustly confirmed by countless micro-evolutionaryand macro-evolutionary studies.’23It is true that, whilst science can explain how life has evolved on Earth, theway it all began is a complete mystery. And, as far as we know, the Earth is theonly location where life exists.In the nineteenth century some people speculated that there might be life, oreven people, living on the Moon. It is now certain that no natural life couldexist on the Moon, which is a barren world constantly irradiated by the Sun andlacking in both available surface water and a sufficiently dense atmosphere tosupport life. There was a more recent time when Venus, the second planet outfrom the Sun, seemed a potential candidate for some type of life because itsdense clouds hid the surface from view so that, for all we knew, it might be asgreen and verdant as that of the Earth. But as we now know, it is furnace hotand continually subjected to sulphuric acid rain. As a result, the chances forlife seem almost nonexistent.Mars is certainly cooler and there may be water existing near its polar regions.At the time of writing this book, some people are still clinging to thepossibility that there could be some sort of primitive life on Mars either now,or at some time in its remote past. If it does exist at all, life on Mars islikely to be extremely simple. Other planets in the solar system, being gaseousgiants in the main, are even less likely to support any sort of life as we knowit.By far the majority of experts now accept that if advanced life of any sort doesexist in places other than the Earth, we will almost certainly have to look deepinto interstellar space to find it. Our solar system is only one of many thatundoubtedly exist, even in our own corner of space. Astronomers have identifiedsuns that have planets orbiting them and it is estimated there are a thousandmillion stars in our own galaxy, any one of which could possess a planetarysystem where life might have evolved and flourished. Beyond our galaxy there arecountless others, so it may be wrong to think that only our tiny little blueplanet, amidst such a proliferation of planet-bearing suns, has produced athinking species such as our own.But as far as we know right now, we are alone.Once the sheer size of space was ascertained it also became apparent that evenif there are hundreds or thousands of intelligent species out there, the chancesof us actually encountering them in any way is quite small. Distance is aproblem but it isn’t the only one. One of the greatest stumbling blocks could betime itself. In order for us to communicate with another advanced species, itwould have to have reached at least our level of sophistication either at thesame time as us or shortly before. Although humanity has created at least acouple of probes that are presently leaving the environs of our own solarsystem, it will be decades, or maybe centuries, before we embark on interstellarspace travel to any significant extent. Even if we do, the answers we arelooking for, in terms of finding other intelligent beings, are likely to beprotracted.The thought of any spacecraft travelling faster than the speed of light remainsin the realms of science fiction. If, as Einstein proposed, light speed is asfast as anything can ever travel, it would take many years merely to reach thenearest star. To go beyond our own galaxy, the Milky Way, would seem impossiblebecause the next nearest place we could visit is the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxywhich has ‘only’ a few million stars and is a staggering 80,000 light yearsaway. The next nearest galaxy is the Large Magellanic Cloud and that is 170,000light years distant.Setting out to actually meet our intergalactic or extragalactic cousins seems tobe a hopeless idea, even if we knew where they were located. So does this meanwe can never say hello to any of them? Not necessarily. If we cannot greet themface-to-face, it might be possible to listen to them.Much of the energy so created streams out into space as electromagneticradiation. There are many wavelengths of this radiation, some of which arefamiliar to us in our daily lives. The full panoply of this radiation is knownas the ‘electromagnetic spectrum’. The shortest of the wavelengths are those wecall ‘gamma waves’. At the other end of the electromagnetic spectrum areextremely long radio waves, which we harness every day. Visible light is also acomponent of the electromagnetic spectrum, as are the microwaves used daily inmany cookers.In fact we are getting radio messages from all parts of the cosmos all the time.These are emitted by suns and other much stranger bodies within our own galaxyand beyond it, as a result of the physical processes taking place within them.Electromagnetic radiation travels across the near vacuum of space at the speedof light. Once it was realized that we could listen in on the processes takingplace in our stellar backyard and beyond, radio astronomy was born.In 1931 an American engineer by the name of Karl Jansky, who was working for theBell Telephone Laboratories, was conducting experiments into interference thatwas taking place across certain radio wavelengths. He built a succession ofaerials and managed to isolate three distinct sources of radio interference orstatic. Firstly he could detect local thunderstorms; and secondly, storms takingplace at a greater distance. However, there was a third source of interferencethat was steady and always present which he couldn’t, at first, identify. Bymoving his aerials, Jansky was eventually able to isolate the source of thisthird form of radio interference. To his own and many other people’s greatsurprise it was coming from within the Milky Way and in fact it originated atthe very centre of our own galaxy.Like many controversial discoveries Jansky’s were ignored for some years. Butnot everyone was sceptical. Reading about Jansky’s observations, in 1937 anotherradio engineer, Grote Reber, built his own aerial, though this one would havebeen more familiar to a modern radio astronomer because it was a dish. Reberalso picked up the strange ‘messages’ from space.Interest in the signals from space gradually increased. In 1942 a British Armyofficer, J S Hay, made the first observations of radio emissions from our ownSun, whilst working on ways to jam German radio signals. Once the Second WorldWar was over, radio astronomy really took off and within a few years discretesignals from all parts of space were being received. Ultimately a backgroundradio source was recognized that could not be isolated to a particular point inspace and it was finally realized, in the 1960s, that this was the signal leftby the Big Bang – the very birth of the Universe itself.Of course, all the signals that were being received were perfectly natural inorigin. But towards the end of the 1950s it began to occur to a number of thoseinvolved in radio astronomy that if any species out there in space was alreadymore advanced than we were, it might well make use of radio waves in order tolet us know it existed. Most radio signals received from space can be readilyidentified and even those that proved to be a puzzle at first have been shown tohave a natural origin. But if an advanced species actively wanted to send amessage, it would not be difficult for it to use a type of radio signal thatcould not be confused with that created by any natural phenomena – for example,one containing an obvious mathematical formula.In 1961, when the ‘race for space’ had fired the imagination of a generation, anew organization came into existence. It was called SETI – ‘the Search forExtraTerrestrial Intelligence’. SETI was primarily the brainchild of anenthusiastic young electrical engineer turned radio astronomer by the name ofFrank Drake, a 31-year-old engineer who had become interested in radio astronomywhilst at Harvard Graduate School.Drake was fascinated by the prospect of radio astronomy being used to identifyother intelligent species in the cosmos and thought that we should be activelylistening in for any message that might be transmitted from deep space. Togetherwith another interested scientist, J Peter Pearman, an officer on the SpaceBoard of the National Academy of Sciences, Drake arranged the first SETIconference.Anxious to show the world just how likely extraterrestrial life surely was,Drake came up with what is now known as the ‘Drake Equation’. This reached theconclusion that there must be many thousands of intergalactic civilizationscapable of creating and sending radio messages across space.The idea of SETI was immediately popular with the public and for a while NASAhad some involvement. During the 1960s and ’70s, NASA’s contribution was fairlylow-key, but in 1992 nasa initiated a much more formal SETI programme.Unfortunately, less than a year later, the United States Congress cancelled thefunding and NASA, reluctantly, pulled out of the SETI research programme. Thiscertainly wasn’t the end of the story because a proportion of the intended NASAresearch was taken over by the non-profit-making SETI Institute and by anassociated body, the SETI League.SETI has now enlisted the help and support of people from around the globe. Manycomputer users are regularly sent packages of information received by SETI, inorder that it can be analyzed during computer down time. Millions of individualsare involved in what is known as the SETI@home project at the present time.Exactly where in the electromagnetic spectrum we should be listening fordeliberately created messages from the stars was decided in 1959. PhillipMorrison and Giuseppe Cocconi, two young physicists at Cornell University in theUnited States had co-operated to submit an article to the prestigious sciencejournal, Nature, which appeared in September 1959. It was entitled ‘Searchingfor Interstellar Communications’. When trying to ascertain which part of theelectromagnetic spectrum to monitor for alien signals, Morrison and Cocconiultimately opted for a frequency of 1420MHz. Not only does this frequency fallin a very ‘quiet’ part of the available spectrum, it also represents theemission frequency of the most common element in the Universe, which ishydrogen. Morrison and Cocconi believed that any intelligent species wouldrealize these two facts and so would therefore be most likely to transmit agreeting at or around this frequency.Some promising messages have been received across the last three decades but, inthe end, all of them turned out to be natural phenomena. Space can supply somesurprisingly ‘ordered’ signals. Rapidly spinning objects in space known as‘pulsars’ are a good case in question, so SETI experts are extremely careful andalso deeply sceptical when any apparent ‘letter from the stars’ is announced.One of the greatest problems for SETI, or indeed anyone trying to pick up amessage from space, is knowing exactly what to expect. It is certain that anyspecies sending such a message will be in advance of us technologically becauseif the message received comes from deep space it must have taken thousands oreven millions of years to reach us. The culture that sent it might, by the timeit is received, have disappeared, advanced even further or simply become boredwith the whole notion. All we can do is to take an educated guess and supposethat for any species there will be commonality in terms of the irrefutable lawsof physics.We may receive a logically repeating mathematical sequence such as pi or a listof prime numbers, it is simply impossible to know. There are sceptics around whosuggest that the whole process of looking for such a message is destined tofail, if only because other intelligent species out in space may be so differentto us that there would be no points of contact recognizable on both sides. Inother words, they may be trying to contact us right now and we simply cannotunderstand the message.By the summer of 2004 we were already beginning to reach our own conclusionsabout how an intelligent species from elsewhere might have already contacted us– humanity simply had not recognized the fact yet. Serendipity being what it is,an article appeared in the August 2004 edition of New Scientist. It was writtenby Paul Davies, a scientist at The Australian Centre for Astrobiology atMacquarie University, Sydney. We found it pleasing that a respected scientistwas publicly discussing the idea that an alien culture may have put a messageintended for us in place many millions of years ago: a message, that ProfessorDavies also likens to the plot of the film 2001: A Space Odyssey.Whilst congratulating SETI for its efforts to track down incoming messages fromspace, Paul Davies makes the suggestion that to try and contact humanity by wayof radio signals might prove to be fairly unreliable for any alien species faraway. He points out that the problem of ‘timing’ might make radio contactdifficult, if not impossible. No matter how many such intelligent societiesthere might be, the chance of them transmitting during the short time slotduring which we have been listening is very remote. Is it not possible, Daviesasks, whether such a culture, probably immeasurably older than our own, may haveconceived of a much more reliable way to let us know of its existence?Might it not have opted for a method of communication that was not dependentupon transmitting signals for many millions of years in the hope that we, orsomeone like us, had just evolved the ability to decipher messages in the formof radio waves? Would it not be more likely that our intergalactic cousins wouldhave chosen something much more timeless?This suggestion, when we read it near the start of Davies’ article, made us situpright and pay attention because we were already asking ourselves the samequestion. Davies goes on to suggest that, rather than radio messages, a far morereliable way for any alien species to contact us would be to leave artefacts inthe vicinity of planets likely to spawn intelligent life that, given sufficientadvancement on the part of such a developing species, it could not fail torecognize.Then we came across yet more heavyweight scientists with similar, highlylogical, thought.Professor Christopher Rose of Rutgers University in New Jersey and GregoryWright, a physicist with Antiope Associates also in New Jersey, have stated thatthe transmission of a radio signal by an extraterrestrial civilization, thatwould probably have to be detected 10,000 light years away, does not make sense.They suggest that it would be far more efficient to send us some kind ofphysical message inscribed on physical matter – a kind of ‘message in a bottle’.And, they believe, such a message could already be waiting for us in our ownbackyard.24Rose observed that: ‘If energy is what you care about, it’s tremendously moreefficient to toss a rock.’ Once radio signals pass us by they are gone for ever,so aliens would have to beam signals continuously as we have only had radio fora miniscule fraction of our existence as an advanced species.We had to ask ourselves, what if that physical object was the Moon and theinformation is there for us to see – once we understand the vocabulary?If the Moon does hold a message, it would be exactly what Paul Davies called a‘set and forget’ technique that would survive for millions or even billions ofyears. Any conventional sort of physical structure, no matter how impressive,would eventually crumble under geological forces, especially on a very activeplanet such as our own. It turns out that the possibilities for a ‘letter fromthe stars’ that can survive eons are actually very limited indeed. In the endsuch a ‘physical’ message needs to be either extremely large or extremely small– and as we were to discover, perhaps both.We had already uncovered a wealth of published academic material that points tothe Moon being the single most important factor in the development and nurturingof complex life forms on the planet Earth. Quite simply, if the Earth is thoughtof as an incubator for life – the Moon is the carefully programmed machine thatmonitors and stabilizes the process. A real life-support system.This may be a wonderful coincidence of epic proportions, or it could be yetanother miracle to ignore as an inevitable consequence of the ‘AnthropicPrinciple’.Whether or not the suggestion put forward by Davies has any merit, it was thesecond time in a month during which perfectly respectable and serious scientistshad published articles dealing honestly with the possibility that we are notalone in the Universe and that other species may be trying, or might have triedin the past, to contact us. Whilst we are delighted with the open-mindedattitude that seems to be developing with regard to this subject it is ourprofound belief that the message, for which SETI, Paul Davies and Rose andWright are seeking, is right in front of our eyes. It has been there as long ashumanity has existed and what it has to tell us is breathtaking in itsimplications."},{"pageContent":"A POTENTIAL MESSAGE?At this point we asked ourselves what would a message look like that had beenplanted on Earth or in its immediate environs and which was intended to survivefor a huge period of time. Firstly, we reasoned, it would have to berecognizable, so it could be clearly interpreted as a message before itscontents could be deciphered. Secondly, it would need to be either extremelylarge or else very small in order to survive the destructive power of Earth’sgeology and weather systems.In Clarke and Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey, the technique used by the unknownaliens was to have a major anomaly that could only be detected by a technicallycompetent species. By placing objects with huge mass under the surface of theMoon the aliens knew they would be easy to spot in a place where there waslittle else to distract. But in that story the purpose of the gravitationalanomalies was not to communicate with the new species – it was to send a messageback to the aliens that the local creatures had reached a specific level ofintelligence.So, an anomaly of this sort might be enough to alert an unknown species, such asour own, that there is a message waiting. The next step would be for thoseplanting the message to ensure that the target species understood that it wasaddressed to them.It has long been agreed that numbers are the best way to communicate withintelligent creatures from another world. Hieroglyphs or any kind of marks areunlikely to be understood without any point of reference, just as there was noway to understand ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs until the Rosetta Stone wasdiscovered in 1799. This inscribed artefact from the second century BC gave thesame text in both Greek and hieroglyphs; thereby providing the key tounderstanding a lost language.If numbers are used in such a message they need to have a discernable pattern,however they are communicated, so that they stand out against the background‘noise’ of number values that surround us everywhere. Even then, it is extremelychallenging to think of numbers that are certain to be spotted once they areplanted in our own environment. The safest method would be to use ratios thatstand out, because ratios are not dependent on units of measurement or anychosen base (e.g. base ten in everyday usage or base two [binary] as used incomputing).But it occurred to us that we were examining this process backwards, because westarted out by being alerted to major anomalies specifically related to theMoon. Not only does it appear very unlikely that the Moon could have occurrednaturally in thefirst place, it also turns out that it has been the incubationmachine that so perfectly nurtured life.We now needed to go back to our starting position and look at the numbers thathad fallen out of the Earth–Moon–Sun relationship in terms of ratios and tothose measurements that stood out so well when we applied Megalithic units tothem.The first and most obviously strange thing about the Moon is how it appears tobe the same size as the Sun when viewed from Earth. It is 400 times smaller and400 times closer to the Earth than the Sun. Assuming for a moment that thismight be the first part of a calling card from an unknown source rather thanjust a bizarre coincidence, we have to note three factors: 1. It is designed to be meaningful only to intelligent creatures living on the Earth’s surface. 2. It is designed to be noticed at this specific point in time, give or take a million years or so each way, because the Moon only behaves in the way it does at this time. 3. It appears to be addressed to a species with ten fingers, because the ratio relationship of that between the Moon and the Sun is such a round number when expressed in base ten (e.g. in base eight the ratio would be one to 620).Now we will speculate that the ratio of the Moon and the Sun just might bepointing to a deliberately created message. In order to do so, we must suspendall preconceptions of what seems sensible and consider instead what under normalcircumstances might be judged unthinkable.We will therefore temporarily accept that points 1, 2 and 3 above are valid andthat someone or something is trying to direct the attention of Earthlings,sporting ten digits and living during this particular point in time, to look atthe Moon as a potential message.So, here we go!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER NINETHE POTENTIAL MESSAGEIn the beginning there was neither existence nor non-existence; there was noatmosphere, no sky, and no realm beyond the sky. What power was there? Where wasthat power? Who was that power?Rig Veda 10:129.1-7 (circa 4000 BC)At this point we had decided that we could not continue to gather further factswithout having some plan in place. The way forward seemed to be to develop ahypothesis so that we could see how the component parts of the puzzle may fittogether. We agreed to suspend all negative comments for a time, so that we didnot miss a point by rejecting something that challenged our preconceptions. Onlywhen we had a complete model for our hypothesis, would we critically appraise itand compare it to other possible explanations.So, we are now entering the modelling world by temporarily accepting thefollowing three concepts as real: 1. The Moon was engineered by an unknown agency circa 4.6 billion years ago, to act as an incubator to promote intelligent life on Earth. 2. The unknown agency knew that humanoids would be the result of the evolutionary chain. 3. That unknown agency wanted the resulting humanoids to know what had been done and they left a message indicated by the dynamics of the Moon.We were well aware that there were some issues with these assumptions, which, ifwe forced ourselves to reconcile them simultaneously, would inhibit lateralthinking. One such problem was the issue of motivation: Why would any agencywant a grand plan that spanned a period that was equal to around fifty per centof the age of the Universe at that astronomically distant time? This would belong-range planning beyond all comprehension. Even then, how did such an agencyknow that the resulting life form would have ten digits? We would try and dealwith these issues but it might be necessary to tackle them at a later stage.Another problem that had to be put to one side for the moment, was the issue ofhow Stone-Age builders came to be using units of measurement that are the key todecoding the message. These issues, amongst others, will have to be dealt within due course, but now we will review the basis of the message.At the root of our hypothesis is the idea that the very dimensions and movementsof the Moon are designed to alert us to the fact that this is not a naturalbody. We therefore need to go back to the beginning of the solar system itself.No one knows for sure how the solar system came into existence but, despite allof the ideas about the Moon being made from the Earth, everyone agrees that theSun, Earth and the Moon were all formed around 4.6 billion years ago. It isthought that the Earth and the Moon were formed very soon after the Sun became astar.Theories come and theories go, but it is likely that it all began when a vastcloud of dust and gas in an empty region of our galaxy became compressed bystarlight and gravitational forces, thereby causing an accumulation process.Otto Schmidt first put the theory of ‘accretion’ forward in 1944 and as more andmore evidence has become available, competitor theories have withered away.In some way, that astronomers do not yet understand, the Sun was formed andproduced light and heat much as it does today. The cloud of dust and gas thatwas wheeling around the new star, kept on cooling and shrinking and whirlingfaster and faster before separating into rings. Each of these rings also kept oncooling and shrinking and is thought to have gradually gathered together into asphere of fiery gas, in the case of the terrestrial planets, before cooling somuch that the main part of it became liquid and, eventually, solid.Until quite recently there were two principle theories to explain the Moon’sexistence. One was that it was an object that had formed elsewhere and wassomehow taken into Earth’s orbit; and the other was a theory called‘co-accretion’ or the ‘double planet’ hypothesis. This second theory supposedthat the Earth and the Moon simply grew together as twins, born out of theprimordial swarm of small ‘planetesimals’. However, when lunar rocks werebrought back to Earth it was realized that the Moon has no substantial metalliciron core and that its rocks have oxygen isotopic ratios that are identical tothe Earth’s.The theory that the Moon had originated elsewhere died instantly because it wasobvious that the rocks had formed in exactly the same region of the solar systemas those of the Earth. But the worrying point was that the only alternativetheory was as effectively debunked as the ‘capture’ hypothesis. The‘co-accretion’ could not be correct because the type and proportion of materialsshould be pretty much the same for both bodies if they were twin planets.Suddenly there was no theory of the Moon’s origin in existence. Scientists tellus that nature abhors a vacuum – but scientists abhor a vacuum even more.Something had to be found to explain the inexplicable.It took some years, but in 1984 an idea that seemed to explain the facts was putforward. The original Big Whack theory was an attempt to explain how the Mooncould be made of selected Earth materials. For reasons already covered, it is atheory that simply does not work and we are still in a position where there isno watertight explanation for the Moon being where it is.So let us return to what is generally held to be true about the early solarsystem. The process of making the Earth was not especially quick, as Stein BJacobsen, a professor of geochemistry at Harvard University says: ‘Within100,000 years of the formation of the Sun, the first embryos of the planetsMercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars had formed… Some grew more rapidly than others,and within ten million years, about sixty-five per cent of Earth had formed.’ 25Let us now consider a theory of the Earth–Moon system that does work. The thrustis that it is the result of intelligent design. We do not know who or what thishypothetical intelligence was, so we will designate it UCA (Unknown CreativeAgency) for the time being."},{"pageContent":"IN THE BEGINNINGThe young star was shining out, and the clouds of matter that had recentlycircled around it in a series of rings had begun the process of accreting intospheres at differing ranges from the star. One of these proto-planets was some150,000 kilometres distant from the mother star and the UCA realized that it hadthe potential to produce intelligence.The UCA may believe that the Universe is destined to die, maybe by becoming asmooth and static soup of incredibly thinly dispersed matter, just a tinyfraction above absolute zero. A nothingness that would essentially be the end ofeverything – even time.The goal of the UCA was to seed life wherever possible, to create intelligentbeings that could flourish and go out and seed more life themselves. In this waythe very fabric of the Universe would be turned into self-aware matter thatwould slowly halt and reverse the mindless spiral into entropy and eternalchaos. They had a model to use for this location – one that would produce aspecific type of intelligent creature, based on carbon and enabled by liquidwater.But it would take several billion years for the tumbling sphere to stabilize andgo through a process of evolution of life forms that would result in a specieswith the intelligence and, more importantly, the imagination to understand theirrole of striking out into the cosmos to shape and form swirling stardust – andthen give it the spark of life.It was important that when this fledgling planet spawned its thinking andtechnologically able offspring, the creatures would understand exactly what hadhappened to bring them into existence, so that they could eventually repeat theprocess themselves. In this way, a self-aware Universe would continue toreplicate itself across the massive span of space and time.The engineering requirement was demanding.The proto-planet was completely unstable and it was destined to develop asurface that would be far too rigid to create the necessary conditions for lifeto begin and to thrive. It required a regulator – a gravitational presence closeby, that would tip it over just enough to cause the surface to have a tinytemperature range that would oscillate gently to evenly distribute the energyradiated from its mother star. This also had to be a regulator that wouldinitially use its gravity to plough the surface so that essential minerals couldbe released for the life-development process to continue.It was clear that the planet needed to have a loosened surface and the obviousconclusion was to manufacture the regulator from the surface material. Thiswould reduce the tendency of the surface to form one continuous crust and wouldallow movement within the crust itself. Judging the required mass, size andorbital characteristics of the regulator was a stupendously complex calculation,because it not only needed to have a changing relationship with the planet overtime – it also had to contain the message addressed to the resulting intelligentlife form.The equilibrium point was calculated and it was found that seventy-fourquintillion tonnes would have to be removed from the planet to manufacture theregulator. To meet all requirements it was going to need a mass that was only1.234 per cent of the revised planet yet its physical size had to be arelatively large, being 27.322 per cent of its parent. It would therefore haveto be made with the barest minimum of heavy elements such as iron and, eventhen, it would need to either be partially hollow or have the consistency of asponge.Mechanisms were then put in place to remove a stream of material from the youngplanet, that would be spun into a new planet in close Earth orbit. The designwas such that the regulator would slowly increase its orbital distance until itreached an average range of around 384,500 kilometres at the expected time ofthe arrival of intelligent life. This would mean that to the creatures on theplanet’s surface, the disc of the regulator would appear, with the naked eye, tobe the same size as the star at the centre of the system – which would be thefirst line of the message to make the developing Earth creatures become curiousabout the regulator. The realization that the factor for each was precisely 400would also indicate that the message would be delivered in base-ten arithmetic.Perhaps the UCA used something like black-hole technology to carefully striponly lighter elements from the infant planet. A black hole is a super-denseentity with so much gravity that even light is jsucked into it, like dust into avacuum cleaner. A black hole with the mass of Mount Everest would have aminiscule radius – roughly the size of an atomic nucleus – and current thinkingis that it would be hard for such a black hole to swallow anything, although itwould certainly attract material like a giant magnet. Such an idea might explainthe mascons (the regions of high gravity) still found on the Moon.However the engineering job was undertaken, the biggest challenge was tocommunicate the message that the intelligent creatures endemic to the Earthwould spot, because the very familiarity of seeing the regulator in the nightsky would cause them to take it for granted. And the UCA knew that intelligencesometimes leads to a dulling of imagination, resulting in confusion between‘describing’ and ‘understanding’. Contrary to what some intelligent individualsconsider, the ability to describe something does not equate with understandingit.The next levels of the message needed to be more difficult to ignore. Thedecision was made to create number patterns that stand out as very strange.The UCA realized that it needed to draw further attention to the artificialnature of the regulator by building on a truly fundamental number thatrepresented the planet. The number that was chosen was the planet’s spin rateper orbit of the star, which would have to be instantly recognizable as a valuethat was unique to the planet – a natural PIN (personal identification number)for an entire world. So, in this case it was a Planetary Identification Numberthat was required.At the required time window, the planet would be rotating at a rate of 366revolutions for each orbit around its mother star, and the use of the numbervalue 366 would therefore be easily spotted as the Planetary IdentificationNumber.The intelligent creatures would recognize the PIN number from an early date asit requires only very basic astronomy to appreciate that this three-digit numberis the most fundamental of all numbers that are unique to the planet.Surely these Earth-dwelling creatures would be very surprised when theycalculated the relative size of their planet to the orbiting regulator anddiscovered that the one is 366 per cent larger than the other.The regulator was also engineered with a PIN number that was meaningful to theintended intelligent creatures. That number would be the reciprocal of theplanet’s PIN number – the mirror image of 366.The mathematics was simplicity itself. The regulator’s PIN number would bearrived at by considering its size as 100 per cent and dividing it by therelative size of the planet, namely 366 per cent. Working to five decimal placesthe result is:100/366 = 0.27322The regulator was then carefully engineered so that at the key point in time itwould be orbiting the planet at a rate of once every 27.322 planetary days.Surely, the creatures would notice that? And as an extra layer, if they lookedat the issue the other way around, the size of the regulator compared to theplanet has precisely the same number value – being 27.322 per cent of itsparent.Surely the intelligent Earth creatures could not fail to be alerted by such anunbelievably improbable number matching? There is absolutely no reason why theregulator’s orbital period in planetary days should numerically echo therelative size relationship it also enjoyed with the Earth.The consequence of these arrangements would not be lost on the new life formsbecause they would easily realize that for every 10,000 of their planetary days,the regulator would complete exactly 366 orbits of the planet. Surely they wouldspot the use of round base-ten numbers and the PIN number 366 being echoed bythe regulator?But then, if they did not recognize these message patterns it would mean thatthey still lacked the intelligence or imagination to be considered mature."},{"pageContent":"FITTING THE MOON INTO THE EARTH–SUN MODELIt struck us as extremely likely that the UCA must have had some control overthe Earth’s rate of spin and its orbital speed, so that they could ensure thatit got to the magic 366 rotations at the required time. From everything that isknown about the Earth, its orbital speed has been steadily decreasing for a longtime but to the astonishment of scientists at the National Institute for Scienceand Technology in Boulder, Colorado, it suddenly stopped this deceleration in1999. CNN reported the story on January 2nd 2004 saying:‘Experts agree that the rate at which the Earth travels through space has slowedever so slightly for millennia. To make the world’s official time agree withwhere the Earth actually is in space, scientists in 1972 started adding an extra‘leap second’ on the last day of the year.For twenty-eight years, scientists repeated the procedure. But in 1999, theydiscovered the Earth was no longer lagging behind.At the National Institute for Science and Technology in Boulder, spokesman FredMcGehan said most scientists agree the Earth’s orbit around the sun has beengradually slowing for millennia. But he said they don’t have a good explanationfor why it’s suddenly on schedule.’This caused us to look up the actual speed that the Earth has settled at in itscircumnavigation of the Sun, and we were surprised to find that its mean orbitalvelocity is almost exactly one ten thousandth of the speed of light in a vacuum.At 29,780 metres per second, the variance is less than two-thirds of onepercent.We thought that this was probably a coincidence – but we could not pick andchoose which factors are, and are not, significant. And we had to remember thatthe value 10,000 had already shown up in the number of Earth days for every 366lunar orbits.We next turned our attention to the Sun. The diameter of the Sun is estimated at1,392,000km and as the average diameter of the Earth is 12,742km, so it followsthat 109.245 Earths could be placed side by side along the diameter of the Sun.This is not a number that stands out for any reason – at least not immediately.But when we looked at the number of Sun diameters in the Earth’s aphelion (itsgreatest distance to the Sun) we found that there are 109.267, effectively anidentical value because the estimate of the Sun’s diameter is within this tinymargin.How strange. There are the same number of Earth diameters in the Sun’s diameteras there are Sun diameters between the Earth and the Sun. This is a near perfectecho that does not work for any other planet in the solar system.These numbers are ratios and are therefore real and independent of units ofmeasurement. But the number also stood out because there are 10,920.8km in theMoon’s equatorial circumference. At the time we noticed this, we considered thatit really did have to be a coincidence because the number of kilometres inanything just could not be relevant since the metre is a unit that is aninvented human convention.But then we realized that the Moon turns at a rate of precisely one kilometreevery second at its equator and that did strike us as very odd. Maybe we hadbeen too hasty in rejecting the role of the metric system.Our observations about the patterns inherent in the size and movement of theMoon, in terms of ratios, stand out as being beyond mere accident. Although weaccept that the apparent patterns that rely on units of measurement, such askilometres, are far harder to accept without an explanation of how this couldhave come about. Any ‘reasonable’ person would immediately reject such factorsas meaningless – but then we think there is a great deal in the old adage that‘all progress is dependent on the unreasonable person’.And some people would not even get to the point of recognizing the patterns inthe ratios within the Sun–Earth–Moon system. A scientifically trained personlooking at any one of these points would almost certainly respond by saying that‘all numbers are equally valid’. A value such as 100 or 40,000 dropping out ofthe mix is just as likely as any other number.We absolutely agree with this view and we would ignore such results if they wereonly happening once or even twice, but we are confronting a whole list of nonrandom-looking values that add up to create what would otherwise be the mostunlikely series of chance events in the history of the cosmos. And, in our view,anyone who dismisses all of these points as coincidence is being either veryillogical or downright dishonest.It is absolutely true that if someone tosses a coin 100 times and it comes outheads every time, the chance of the next toss resulting in another head isexactly 50/50. However, if this ever happens to you in the real world, we wouldsuggest that, before you let them toss the coin again, you check that it is notdouble headed. Only a fool would not be suspicious.Scientific discovery has always been a process of identifying patterns thatstand out from the chaos of random events. For example, identifying areas wherethere are more cases of a specific illness is likely to point to a local factorsuch as radioactive bedrock, a leakage of harmful industrial effluence or acontaminated food plant. When something varies markedly from the norm there isusually a reason.If we look at the available information logically, and without preconceptions ofwhat is and is not possible, the Moon appears to have been inserted into theSun–Earth relationship with the accuracy of the proverbial Swiss clockmaker!"},{"pageContent":"A RECENT INTERACTIONIt appears that no one has previously spotted this message and we only cameacross it because of our findings relating to Megalithic units. We suspect thatthe problem is one of too much knowledge and a loss of the ability of experts,in our super-technological world, to think simply. Perhaps if Galileo or IsaacNewton had access to the information that we have today they would have noticedthese issues concerning the Moon, but, alas, they did not have the accuratemeasurements that we have today and therefore they could not observe thepatterns. Today we have the necessary information, but astronomers areunderstandably more interested in quasars, pulsars and all kinds of deep spaceobjects rather than the fundamentals of the Earth–Moon relationship.We now needed to consider a scenario that would explain how the Megalithic Yardcame to be involved in this ultra-long-distance message.Maybe the UCA was aware of the potential problem of the message headline beingmissed due to over-sophistication and took steps to inject extra informationnear to the key moment when the message needed to be interpreted. Perhaps, wemused, the UCA had stepped in at a number of key points throughout the processof human development.These thoughts were more complex than the set-and-forget scenario of an unknownagency building a planetary regulator that was, in effect, an incubator forlife. The idea that some entity, probably an advanced species from anothergalaxy, established a mechanism to foster life and then moved on seemedreasonable in the face of such evidence. But to have an agency that hasmaintained a periodic involvement with humankind across several billions ofyears is much harder to reconcile.However, we decided to stick to our methodology of viewing the reasons ‘why’ahead of dealing with the reasons ‘why not’. We needed to review the materialfrom ancient history and prehistory that had brought us to look so hard at theMoon.Firstly we had to remember that it was because the stone structures from thefourth millennium BC were apparently created to study the Moon, that AlexanderThom began his lifetime quest to investigate them. Could these large standingstones be pointing deliberately at the Moon and the Sun? The orientation of theMegalithic structures certainly led him to identify the Megalithic Yard as beinga unit of 82.96656cm – give or take 0.61cm. And this in turn led us to thefindings laid out in this book.As stated earlier, we had discovered that the Megalithic Yard was merely thestarting point of a holistic measuring system that dealt with linear distance,mass, volume and time. It was an utterly brilliant system and we found that manymodern units had descended from it, such as the imperial pint and the pound. Wehad been unable to imagine how the pound and the pint could have survived acrossso many millennia but it is a fact of mathematics that they are directlyrelated, either by design or by an incredible series of coincidences.To recap, the most intriguing fact about the Megalithic Yard lay in the way ithad been ingeniously devised to fit accurately into the circumference of theEarth. Megalithic geometry was slightly different to the 360-degree geometryinvented by the Sumerians, which is still in use more than four thousand yearslater. It had been based on 366 degrees, apparently (and very logically) becausethe Earth revolves once on its axis whilst it travels in its great orbitalcircle around the Sun. Under this Stone-Age system of geometry, each of the 366degrees was split into sixty minutes of arc and each minute of arc into sixseconds of arc.The incredible beauty of the system is that when the globe of the Earth wastreated as a huge circle, the polar circumference of the Earth is exactly theright size to give 366 Megalithic Yards to a polar second of arc.We had been very surprised at the way the Megalithic Yard bisected thecircumference of the Earth, but what we didn’t expect to discover was any directconnection between the Megalithic Yard and other bodies within our solar system.And there are none – apart from the Moon and the Sun.The Moon has a beautifully neat 100 Megalithic Yards to each second of arc,which could be a very odd coincidence if it were not for all of the other factswe discovered which point to a whole range of round numbers. And of course theSun has an incredibly round 40,000 Megalithic Yards to each Megalithic second ofarc. What a perfect way to announce an awareness that the Moon is exactly 400times smaller than the Sun.We also noted that whilst the Sun has 40,000 Megalithic Yards to a Megalithicsecond of arc, the metric system was designed so that the Earth’s polarcircumference would be 40,000 kilometres.It had struck us as quite amazing that anyone more than 5,000 years ago couldhave created a unit of measure that worked as a perfect integer of the planetwithin such an elegant system of geometry – starting and finishing with theEarth’s PIN number of 366. Whilst this was impressive, we were perplexed at theapparent impossibility of creating a unit and a geometry that producedbeautifully round integers on the Earth, Moon and Sun. To do so should be asclose to impossible as anything can get.Units that are integer, within the same geometry, for two heavenly bodies wouldbe very difficult – but three? That’s ridiculous! And yet the sums spoke forthemselves. The fact that the approach did not work for any other body in thesolar system pointed to a very special relationship for the Earth, Moon and Sun.The apparent impossibility of the Neolithic inhabitants having had the skills todevelop such a marvellous system is now resolved when we introduce the unknowncreative agency because, if it started with knowledge of the dimensions of thetwo original bodies (the Sun and the Earth), it could have engineered the Moonto made it fit the same rules. Our hypothesis was, therefore, to assume that theUCA somehow instructed the Stone-Age builders to adopt the system we callMegalithic geometry.In our previous book, Civilization One, we speculated that the earliest recordsof the Sumerians and the ancient Egyptians were actually correct when theyclaimed that their own civilizations had been instructed in the arts andsciences by an external agency. In these records there are references to peoplecalled ‘the watchers’ who taught geometry, mathematics, astronomy, agricultureand other sciences. The indigenous population did not know where these peoplehad come from and they described them as having superhuman powers, although theywere clearly human beings and not gods.In around 3100 BC, ancient Egypt became a united kingdom and its period ofrecorded history began. At the same time, the Sumerians were building theirgreat cities and developing sophisticated techniques of metalworking, glassmanufacture and agriculture. In the Indus valley of the Indian subcontinent, theHarappa and Mohenjodaro civilizations were also constructing huge cities and inthe British Isles, superb megalithic structures like Newgrange, Maes Howe andthe Ring of Brodgar were being built. Is it not very strange indeed, that withinsuch a precise period of time the whole world suddenly decided to step up a gearand enter into a period of true civilization?We found it more than odd that these unconnected peoples should all take such alarge step forward at exactly the same time. And we have recently come acrossvery new information that made our suspicions even greater. On December 23rd2004, new findings were published that markedly revise the dating of the firstAmerican civilizations. It reported that evidence now shows that the oldestcivilization in the Americas dates back far earlier than previously thought – infact right back to 3100 BC, at which time complex societies and communalbuilding suddenly appeared in Peru. This emerging culture was the first in theAmericas to develop centralized decision-making, formalized religion, socialhierarchies and a mixed economy based on agriculture and fishing.One member of the team that has reported these findings in the pre-eminentscientific journal, Nature, is Jonathan Haas of the Department of Anthropologyat the Field Museum in Chicago. He said:‘The scale and sophistication of these sites is unheard of anywhere in the NewWorld at this time, and at almost any time. These dates push back the origins ofcivilization in the Americas to something more parallel to those of the othergreat early civilizations.’ 26Some of the settlements that are believed to have had at least 3,000 inhabitantsincluded platform mounds, thought to be pyramids, central plazas, temples andhousing. The largest pyramid at Caral, known as the Primade Mayor, iscontemporary with the earlier Egyptian pyramids, dating from 2627 BC. From thisdata, the archaeologists have concluded that there was large-scale communalconstruction and population concentration across the entire area.Dr José Oliver, a lecturer in Latin American archaeology at the Institute ofArchaeology at University College London, said: ‘This confirms that by 3100 BCmonumental buildings were already under way, not just at an isolated site butacross a whole region.’As we have already stated, science is about recognizing patterns. Humans havenot changed physically or intellectually over the last hundred thousand yearsbut suddenly, just over 5,000 years ago, unconnected people around the worldbegan building major structures and cities; but apart from someSumerian–Egyptian interaction, these groups appear to have developed quiteindependently. Archaeology has not found obvious cross-cultural artefacts so itis assumed that they all blossomed at the same time through sheer coincidence.But if they appeared worldwide because they had all benefited from theinstruction of an unknown creative agency, one shouldn’t necessarily expect anexact commonality of interpretation of these ideas. Nevertheless, it is clearthat there are some significant cultural connections such as the building ofpyramids and Venus worship.There is, it seems, some very powerful, albeit circumstantial, evidence for anintervention by a highly advanced group more than 5,000 years ago. We have toadmit, however, that we cannot conceive how any agency could have maintainedcontact with the Earth’s development over several billions of years.Nevertheless, we do not see it as our place to reject information just becausewe cannot explain it. Everything depends on the ground rules of the observer: ifsomeone refuses to look at obvious patterns because they consider a patternshould not be there, then they will see nothing but the reflection of their ownprejudices."},{"pageContent":"RECIPROCAL NUMBERSAs we reflected on what we had found, the number play involved in theEarth–Moon–Sun system was nothing less than staggering. We were amused by thecharm of this virtual machine especially when using the metric system. We lookedat this little equation using kilometres:(Moon x Earth)/100 = SunThis means that if we multiply the circumference of the Moon by that of theEarth, the result is 436,669,140km. If we then divide this figure by 100 wearrive at 436,669km, which is the circumference of the Sun, correct to 99.9 percent.How weird!Of course, if we divide the circumference of the Sun by that of the Moon andmultiply by 100 we get the polar circumference of the Earth. And, as we havepointed out, if we divide the size of the Sun by the size of the Earth andmultiply by 100 we get the size of the Moon.None of this is magic or pointless numerology. It may well be nothing more thanan amusing coincidence but, given all of the ratio patterning we have observed,it would be foolish to ignore it.However, the idea that kilometres can be meaningful to issues regarding the Moonis hard to swallow. Any reader could be forgiven for doubting what they readhere. Nevertheless if anyone chooses to check out the numbers – it all works.And if you are still not sure about the idea, have a look at this fact; itcertainly astounded us when we came across it.The Moon has a sidereal rotation period of 655.728 hours, which means it rotatesonce every 27.322 Earth days. Given that the Moon has an equatorialcircumference of 10,920.8 kilometres, this means that the Moon is turning at 400kilometres per Earth day!Just consider these unquestionable facts as a whole:The Moon is one 400th the size of the Sun.The Moon is 400 times closer to the Earth than the Sun.The Moon is rotating at a rate of 400km per Earth day.Coincidence? Well, maybe – or maybe not.The Earth is rotating at 40,000 kilometres a day and the Moon is turning at arather precise 100 times less. The Moon always faces the Earth as it travels onits orbit around our planet and yet the average distance is such that theequatorial rotational speed is precisely one per cent of an Earth day. Thesefigures are entirely checkable and indisputable. How could all this beaccidental?Surely, only a fool would not wish to examine this situation further. Yet wehave to be realistic about how some people will view our decision to considerthe apparently impossible. We are well aware that many, and possibly most,experts will turn a blind eye.Terence Kealey, a clinical biochemist and the Vice-Chancellor of the Universityof Buckingham, wrote an article in the (London) Times on November 15th 2004under the title ‘Who says science is about facts? They only get in the way of agood theory’. In this he recollected as follows:‘When Charles Moore was editing The Spectator he once asked me why, of hiscontributors, it was those trained in science who were the least honest… CharlesMoore had supposed that scientists would revere facts, but that supposition is amyth: scientists actually treat facts the way barristers treat hostile witnesses– with suspicion.The mythmaker was Karl Popper. Popper was not a scientist but a politicalphilosopher who proposed that science works by ‘falsifiability’: scientistsdiscover facts; they create a theory to explain them; and the theory is accepteduntil it is falsified by the discovery of incompatible facts that then inspire anew theory… Yet it is a myth that working scientists always respectfalsifiability. Scientists often ignore inconvenient findings.’We could not agree more, and therefore we will not be surprised if people ignorethe possibility that the metric system just might be (crazy though it sounds)fundamental in some way to the Sun and the Moon as well as to the Earth. Thefact remains that, for some reason, the kilometre demonstrates the essence ofthe Sun–Moon–Earth relationship, both in terms of size and orbitalcharacteristics.As if all of this isn’t incredible enough we must also address the fact that theMoon has an orbit that makes it a ‘mirror of time’. As we observed earlier, theMoon mimics the Sun at key points in the year. For example, whilst the Sun setsin the north at the time of the summer solstice, the Moon sets in the south andwhen the Sun sets in the south at the time of the winter solstice, the Moonunerringly sets in the north. This is an aspect of Sun and Moon associationsthat undoubtedly seemed like magic to our ancient ancestors and is yet anotherreflection of the current position and orbital characteristics of the Moon."},{"pageContent":"THE REASONS WHY NOTWe have a constructed a scenario that fits all the facts but has deliberatelyignored some of the challenging consequences that have arisen. We now need todeal with the reasons why this scenario might be wrong. Without the intellectualtether of having to conform to ideas that are within the bounds of what isalready accepted, we have argued that an intelligent agency constructed the Moonto enable life to develop upon the planet we call Earth. We have taken aholistic view and we have not ignored any facts that we do not wish to have inour picture of what might have been.The first problem that we thought we confronted – that of motivation, has beenpotentially answered in that it might be part of a grand quest to convert theUniverse into an intelligent, self-aware single entity at the end of time. Suchan idea would certainly seem to sit well with the principles of some Easternbelief systems such as Hinduism.The Moon was already outrageously impossible before we introduced the issues ofthe intricate web of interrelated values, which we have argued is a deliberatemessage. With the number values that exist in the ratios alone, we fail tounderstand how anyone could seriously claim that they are coincidences. But thebiggest challenge we have to confront is the issue of how the Megalithic Yardand the metric system came to be involved with an artificial Moon constructed asa life-support system for the Earth.We cannot hide from the problem that, if our deductions are accurate, ourunidentified creative agency has had contact with us at least once over the last6,000 years. If this agency wished humans to know what they had done – and they(or it) are capable of making contact so recently – then why don’t they justturn up right now and tell us what was done in the distant past, instead ofleaving messages on the Moon?We were puzzled. This did not seem to make sense.As we debated this tricky point, we considered an alternative scenario thatwould not require direct contact from the UCA. Perhaps, we mused, the rise ofthe Megalithic system and even the metric system were programmed into ourplanet, to the extent that humans respond to these values quite naturally andwithout knowing why. Perhaps the gravitational effects of the Sun and the Mooninteract with the Earth’s own gravity and the effects of its spinning journeythrough space. It is known that the spinning orbit of the Earth does cause adisturbance in time-space, so maybe the value that we have called the PINnumber, the value 366, is actually the heartbeat of our planet. Perhaps wecannot help but follow certain numerical patterns?We were raising questions faster than we were solving problems but there was astrong logic to this notion. We knew that the ancient Sumerians had used asystem virtually identical to the metric system in the middle of the thirdmillennium BC, with a double kush that was 99.88 per cent of a metre. This unitwas accompanied by others that were virtually a litre and a kilo.We had already noted that the second of time appeared to be real in some way,rather than just an abstract convention. On Earth a pendulum that swings at arate of once a second will have a length of a metre, with tiny variationsdependent on the user’s precise distance from the planet’s core.Perhaps the values programmed into the Earth by the UCA were so fundamental thatany intelligent life form evolving on the Earth would respond to them. Therelatively recent discovery that pendulums appear to go haywire during a totaleclipse could point to brief interruptions of this Earthly harmony. We wereaware that we were putting speculation upon speculation but it made sense. Andwe have to remember that we are not trying to displace any well-reasoned theoryalready in existence, so these possibilities have the benefit of being alone infitting all of the known facts.The bottom line to all this is that some unknown creative agency made the Moonout of parts of the Earth so that it would act as an incubator for life. Thenext question to confront was this: What was put into the incubator so that itwould eventually grow into an intelligent life form? Setting up the hardware wasimpressive enough but what software was used?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TENTHE IMPOSSIBLE ACCIDENT‘A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life andthe complexity of nature.’Professor Anthony Flew, December 2004Not very long ago, religion was the only guide to the way the world wasperceived. For right or for wrong the various scriptures of theologicaltradition provided a way of making sense of everything from the miracle of birthto the movement of the stars in the sky. But today we have rational thinking –we have science.The word ‘science’ is from the Latin scire, meaning ‘to know’ and it isconcerned with the organization of objectively verifiable sense experience. Inother words, it makes sense of the way we see the world in a testable andverifiable way. It seems that there is nothing that science cannot explain givenenough time and study. From Anthropology to Zoology, the people of thetwenty-first century have experts who can explain where almost everything camefrom and how it works.But science does have its limits. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle, forexample, means that we cannot exactly know the position and the momentum of aparticle simultaneously. We can choose one or the other – but we cannot haveboth. And there is at least one subject that science appears to be unable toexplain. The origin of life.In his book, How to Think Straight, Professor Anthony Flew has pointed out thatpractical reasoning and clear thinking are essential for everyone who wants tomake proper sense of the information we receive each day. He stresses theimportance of being able to quickly know the difference between valid andinvalid arguments, the contradictory versus the contrary, vagueness andambiguity, contradiction and self-contradiction, the truthful and thefallacious. These, he says, are the qualities that separate clear thinkers fromthe crowd.27After sixty-six years as a leading champion of atheism and logicalthinking, Professor Anthony Flew has made sense of new information which has ledhim to state that science appears to have proven the existence of God. Flew’sreason for this monumental about turn is the discovery of evidence that showsthat some sort of intelligence must have created the world we inhabit. He hasparticularly pointed to the investigation of DNA by biologists, which has shownthat an unbelievable complexity of the arrangements are needed to produce life;leading to the conclusion that intelligence must have been involved.We have bemoaned the lack of objectivity that often pervades the academiccommunity but we must applaud a man who is prepared, at the age of eighty-one,to throw away the cornerstone of his life’s work. That takes guts!The first the world knew of Flew’s change of heart was his letter to theAugust–September 2004 issue of the Philosophy Now journal where he stated: ‘Ithas become inordinately difficult even to begin to think about constructing anaturalistic theory of the evolution of that first reproducing organism.’Flew is a man of principle and when he was asked if his startlingly new ideaswould upset some people, he responded by saying, ‘That’s too bad… my whole lifehas been guided by the principle of Plato’s Socrates: Follow the evidence,wherever it leads.’How refreshing. That is exactly what we are trying to do with the information wehave gathered about the Moon and the origins of life on our apparently designedincubator.We have arrived at a point where we need to try and understand the emergence oflife. And we find, at this precise moment, that the old assumptions about howlife originated have been thrown out of the window.The first question we asked ourselves is: What do we mean by ‘life’?We use the term to cover all kinds of organisms from cyanobacteria to plants andanimals. The essence of life is reproduction, the formation of identical or nearidentical copies of a complex structure from simple starting materials. Theincrease of complexity involved in the formation of living organisms from theirprecursors distinguishes the processes of biological growth and reproductionfrom physical processes such as crystallization. This local increase ofcomplexity can also be described as a decrease of entropy, which we have alreadyspeculated might be the motivation of the unknown creative agency that seededand promoted life on Earth.But where is the boundary of what is and what is not a life form. Is, forexample, a virus a living entity? The standard answer is ‘no it is not’, butthat is now seen as a very debatable point. Viruses cannot replicate on theirown but can do so when they occupy a host. In the late nineteenth century,researchers realized that some diseases were caused by biological objects thatwere then thought to be the simplest and smallest of all living, gene-bearinglife-forms. Throughout most of the twentieth century, though, viruses have beendesignated as non-living material.All living organisms possess a genome, which is the set of instructions formaking the body, and this is always composed of nucleic acid. It is usually DNA(deoxyribonucleic acid) or in the case of some viruses, RNA (ribonucleic acid).The genome consists of a number of genes, each of which is a segment of nucleicacid coding for a particular type of protein molecule. In October 2004, Frenchresearchers announced findings that blurred the boundary once again. DidierRaoult and his colleagues at the University of the Mediterranean in Marseilleannounced that they had sequenced the genome of the largest known virus,Mimivirus, which had been discovered in 1992. This virus, about the size of asmall bacterium, contained numerous genes previously thought to only exist incellular organisms. The virus is therefore a very smart bit of ‘dead’ matter orit is part of a unique club of entities only known to exist upon Earth.The remarkable nature of living matter caused astrobiologist Paul Davies toobserve in December 2004:‘Most people take the existence of life for granted, but to a physicist like meit seems astounding. How do stupid atoms do such clever things? Physicistsnormally think of matter in terms of inert, clod-like particles jostling eachother, so the elaborate organization of the living cell appears little short ofmiraculous. Evidently, living organisms represent a state of matter in a classapart from the rest.’"},{"pageContent":"THE SOLUTION THAT IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEMBack in 1953, when Watson and Crick discovered the helical structure of the DNAmolecule and the general way that it coded the formation and replication ofproteins in cells, it seemed that a plausible scientific explanation for theorigin of life was about to be assembled. The laboratory synthesis of aminoacids from basic chemicals further heightened the expectations that humankindwas on the verge of creating a living cell.It was suggested that the early Earth, through a mixture of volcanic activityand landmass weathering, had acquired oceans rich in nutrients and chemicals –known as ‘the primeval soup’. It was in the constant mixing and intermixing ofchemicals, and probably with the aid of lightning strikes, that the firstprimitive life had come into existence – or so the evolutionists suggested.Experts remained confident that the primeval soup theory was the most likelyexplanation and were convinced that, given time, someone would manage to createlife in a laboratory.Soon after Watson and Crick’s discovery, Stanley Miller, a graduate student fromChicago University, co-operated with Harold Urey, a Nobel Prize winner, torecreate the exact circumstances that are believed to have existed in theprimeval soup of the infant Earth. Their soup contained water vapour, hydrogen,methane and ammonia. It was estimated that lightning had played a part in theemergence of life, so Miller and Urey provided an electrical spark to theirchemical soup and eventually succeeded in creating simple amino acids.‘Hooray!’, they and everyone else concerned said, because amino acids are amajor component of organic life. Unfortunately, more than half a century later,no one has come any closer to actually creating life than this.It has also been pointed out that the amino acids created by Miller, Urey andothers are but a tiny few of the constituents required for life. In any case,the experiment was very selective in its methods. Amino acids are referred to asbeing left- and right-handed, both of which were present in Miller and Urey’ssoup, whereas life uses only left-handed amino acids. What is more, the veryelectrical spark that created the amino acids would also have destroyed them, sothey had to be artificially isolated in the experiment.It might be thought reasonable that if life once formed in the oceans, it wouldcontinue to do so today. In reality this can’t happen because the mixture oftemperatures, chemicals and gases present is wrong. It was generally acceptedthat life could not spontaneously appear in an oxygen rich atmosphere and so theevolutionists had to suggest a very different sort of atmosphere on the infantEarth. (Oxygen, whilst preserving life, destroys organic molecules that are notalive.)Generating life in the laboratory proved to be utterly impossible andresearchers began to realize that new natural laws would need to be discoveredto explain how the high degree of order and specificity of even a single cellcould be generated by random, natural processes.The DNA molecule is in the form of a double helix – rather like a ladder twistedinto a spiral. The bases of the DNA are found in pairs and these make up therungs of the ladder that carry the information to replicate the entity. When DNAcopies itself, the ladder breaks down the middle of the rungs. New bases arematched to the bases of each upright and so the original DNA molecule thenbecomes two new identical molecules of DNA. Information necessary to build newproteins, and to perform other necessary chemical changes, is taken to variousparts of a cell by another molecule, this one being ribonucleic acid (RNA). RNAis similar to DNA but is only a single helix. RNA is therefore the ‘messenger’that allows the information held within DNA to be distributed and acted upon.An important question remains, and it is one that science still cannot answer.How did DNA come about in the first place, because as things stand now, only DNAcan create DNA.Some chromosomes contain extremely long strings of DNA of more than a metre inlength, which is colossal considering the microscopic nature of the DNA moleculeitself. However, the question that has puzzled everyone concerned is the originof this process, because all enzymes are proteins and protein synthesis must bedirected by DNA. Yet, DNA replication cannot take place without these proteins.So, what came first – the protein or the DNA?The problem goes right back to the origin of all life. But it is a problem thatappears to have no answer. What is certain is that amino acids, nucleotides,lipids and other multi-atom molecules can be manufactured at random by heat, forexample from lightning strikes. They can also come about from sunlight and othersources of energy that don’t themselves have life. Many ideas have been putforward to explain the occurrence of DNA but none of them can be more thaneducated guesses.But as we were researching this book a new theory appeared, and it is one thathas gained favour with many experts. This theory suggests that DNA exists thanksto the presence of Earth’s Moon!Four billion years ago, the orbit of the Moon was much closer to the Earth thanit is today. At this time, the Earth was spinning much faster on its axis andphenomenal tides were being raised on the Earth, by the constant passing of theMoon. With the Moon so much closer to Earth the height of the tides would havebeen colossal (see chapter 5).Richard Lathe, a molecular biologist at Pieta Research in Edinburgh, hassuggested that within the primordial oceans, constantly dragged back and forthby the passing of the Moon, DNA could have been rapidly multiplied. 28One of the most commonly held theories regarding the origin of DNA is that itemerged when smaller, precursor molecules in the waters of the early oceans –‘primeval soup’ – came together or were ‘polymerized’ into long strands. Theselong strands, it is suggested, became the templates for more molecules to attachthemselves along the templates, which eventually resulted in double-strandedmolecules like DNA.Richard Lathe suggests that the problem lies in the need for some mechanism thatwould constantly break apart the double strands, in order to keep the processgoing. He maintains it would have taken some external force to dissociate thetwo strands.It is at around 50°C that single DNA strands act as templates for synthesizingcomplementary strands, whereas at the higher temperature of about 100°C, thesedouble strands break apart and this doubles the number of molecules. When thetemperature falls, the process begins again. The number of replications growsexponentially with just forty cycles producing a trillion identical copies.A billion years after the Moon came to orbit the Earth, it was extremely closeto its host planet and the Earth was spinning much faster than it is now. Thetides, as Lathe suggests, must have extended several hundred kilometres inland,which meant that coastal areas were subjected to rapid changes in salinity andthis would have led to repeated and very frequent association and dissociationof double-stranded molecules similar to those of DNA.As the huge tides advanced, salt concentrations would have been very low. Evenmodern double-stranded DNA breaks apart under such conditions, becauseelectrically charged phosphate groups on each strand repel each other. However,when the tides receded, precursor molecules and precipitated salt would havebeen present in high concentrations. Lathe claims that this would haveencouraged DNA-like double-stranded molecules to form, because high saltconcentrations neutralize DNA’s phosphate charges and this allows strands tostick together.It is these constant salty cycles and changes in temperature that, Lathe says,would have amplified molecules such as DNA but he points out that the tidalforces were absolutely vital in the process. Whilst it is true that the Sun alsocreates tides on the Earth, these are of a very low magnitude compared to thosecaused by the much closer Moon. Three billion years ago it was closer still.Without DNA there could be no life because it stands at the very heart of thereplication of living matter. From the single-celled amoeba to the largest bluewhale on our planet, DNA is the vital component that began life and which keepsit going. Perhaps Richard Lathe is correct and it was the presence of so large aMoon that began the chemical process that led to us, but it does remain a factthat despite all the theories, no scientist has yet managed to take the variouschemicals that comprise life and arrange them in such a way that they becomeeven the very simplest life form.Lathe’s theory could explain how the Moon caused the early replication of DNAbut its origin remains a complete mystery, and many scientists are quiteunsettled about the theory of how life came into existence in the first place.For example, David A Kaufmann PhD, of the University of Florida said, ‘Evolutionlacks a scientifically acceptable explanation of the source of the preciselyplanned codes within cells without which there can be no specific proteins andhence, no life.’Admittedly David Kaufmann is a creationist, so maybe we can expect him to cometo this conclusion. But then there is Professor Hubert P Yockey, a physicistfrom the University of California – who is most definitely not an adherent ofcreation and is concerned that discredited ideas continue to clog up the processof seeking out the truth. He wrote:‘Although at the beginning the paradigm was worth consideration, now the entireeffort in the primeval soup paradigm is self-deception on the ideology of itschampions…The history of science shows that a paradigm, once it has achieved the status ofacceptance (and is incorporated in textbooks) and regardless of its failures, isdeclared invalid only when a new paradigm is available to replace it.Nevertheless, in order to make progress in science, it is necessary to clear thedecks, so to speak, of failed paradigms. This must be done even if this leavesthe decks entirely clear and no paradigms survive. It is a characteristic of thetrue believer in religion, philosophy and ideology that he must have a set ofbeliefs, come what may (Hoffer, 1951). Belief in a primeval soup on the groundsthat no other paradigm is available is an example of the logical fallacy of thefalse alternative. In science it is a virtue to acknowledge ignorance. This hasbeen universally the case in the history of science as Kuhn (1970) has discussedin detail. There is no reason that this should be different in the research onthe origin of life.’ 29Yockey makes this statement because, like many other scientists, he cannotbelieve that the question regarding the emergence of life can be answered at allwell by the primeval soup theory. Like the Double Whack theory of the Moon’sbirth – it is simply wrong and obfuscating progress to a workable explanation.The main reason there is so much unrest about this question is because DNAcannot exist without life, and life cannot exist without DNA. The two aretotally interdependent and create a chicken-and- egg situation that seemsimpossible to resolve.It occurs to us that even the theories of Richard Lathe, on the way the Moon mayhave contributed to the rapid spreading of life through huge tides and chemicalmixing, come no closer to explaining how life actually came about.Some experts still claim that it must have happened by accident, presumablybecause the other possibilities are too hard to swallow. However, it would befar more sensible to claim that fairies from Neverland did it."},{"pageContent":"THE PROBABILITY PROBLEMNobody doubts that the information contained in a single gene must be at leastas great as the enzyme it controls. However, just one average protein containsover 300 amino acids. In order to create the protein it would take a gene of DNAthat would have to contain 1,000 nucleotides in its chain. Every DNA chaincontains four sorts of nucleotide. This seems complicated but it results in apossible 4 x 101000 possible forms. For those who do not realize, 4 x 101000represents the number 4 followed by 1,000 zeros.These are values beyond all comprehension. To get some perspective on this, itis interesting to note that it is estimated that there are only 10 x 1080particles in the whole Universe. One begins to realize how utterly impossible itwould have been for complex DNA to be accidentally created in the primeval soupof the young Earth.In the world of probability, some things are very likely to happen, others mightsometimes happen but some can never happen at all. An expert in probability,Emile Borel (1871–1956) claimed that phenomena with very small probability don’toccur. He estimated that there would be about one chance in 10 x 1050 for asmall probability. Minute though these odds were, they weren’t remote enough formore modern experts in probability. William M Dembski, associate researchprofessor in the conceptual foundations of science at Baylor University and asenior fellow with Discovery Institute’s Center for Science and Culture inSeattle, decided to go further. He estimated that there were 10 x 1080 particlesin the Universe and wondered how many times per second an event might occur. Thenumber he came up with was 10 x 1045. He then calculated the number of secondsfrom the beginning of the Universe to the present time and then, to make sure hewas erring on the side of caution, he multiplied this number by one billion andarrived at the number 10 x 1025 seconds. He now multiplied all the figurestogether achieving a result of 10 x 10150 for his Law of Small Probability.30For a minimum living cell there are 60,000 proteins of 150 configurations. 31Joseph A Mastropaolo, an expert who has tackled this problem at length,estimates that the probability of the evolution of this first cell would be anabsolutely staggering 1 in 10 x 104,478,296 or 10 followed by 4,478,296 zeros.This exceeds Dembski’s estimation for Small Probability by such a great marginthat were it not for the fact that DNA does clearly exist, no self-respectingscientist could uphold the possibility of it having originated by chance.If every particle in the Universe had one chance for every second since thebeginning of time – we still would not have DNA.In case there are readers who doubt Mastropaolo’s scepticism regarding thepossibility of DNA creating itself from scratch, it is interesting to see thathe is far from alone. Peter T Mora of Macromolecular Biology Section, ImmunologyProgram, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland wrote: ‘The presence of aliving unit is exactly opposite to what we would expect on the basis of purestatistical and probability considerations.’32The English scientist J D Bernal said, way back in 1965: ‘The answer would seemto me, combined with the knowledge that life is actually there, to lead to theconclusion that some sequences other than chance occurrences must have led tothe appearance of life as we know it.’33And to add to the list of dissenters regarding a theory that clearly doesn’thold water, primeval or not, we have the opinion of the late Professor Sir FredHoyle, one of the most respected astronomers who has ever lived. ‘Rather thanaccept that fantastically small probability of life having arisen through theblind forces of nature, it seemed better to suppose that the origin of life wasa deliberate intellectual act. By “better” I mean less likely to be wrong.’34However, no matter how great and how many the howls of indignation at thiscomplete disregard of probability, one of the fundamental tools of science, itremains a fact that DNA did occur somehow. As the saying goes, nature abhors avacuum of any sort. No matter how much Professor Yockey may suggest that if wehave no viable theory we should exist without it until one is discovered, itseems that to many scientists a twisted and broken paradigm is better than noneat all.After all, the alternative might be unthinkable to most experts. We might, forexample, have to consider the possibility of a ‘mind’ behind the creation ofDNA, even if we can accept evolution as a viable theory once DNA existed.The majority of scientists would prefer to break their own rules rather than toevoke the deity, but even Professor Sir Fred Hoyle was left with the onlyconclusion that could occur to him, namely that the Universe was under some sortof ‘intelligent cosmic control’.35 Is this the way forward? If we are going tobe truly honest, bearing in mind the utter impossibility of the chanceoccurrence of DNA, might we have to accept that ‘God spoke and it was so’?Who can blame Anthony Flew for turning a lifetime’s work on its head and saying:‘A super-intelligence is the only good explanation for the origin of life andthe complexity of nature.’However, Flew’s definition of God bears little resemblance to the deity ofJudeo-Christian-Islamic tradition, which he describes as being depicted as‘omnipotent Oriental despots – cosmic Saddam Husseins’. He is actuallydescribing something as open as our own ‘Unknown Creative Agency’ – whichpresumably might mean virtually anything from a sublime single entity to agalactic federation of planet seeders!"},{"pageContent":"THE SEEDS OF LIFESome sixty years ago, when quantum theory first emerged, physicists thought themystery of life was about to be resolved. By looking at the tiniest buildingblocks of matter it was starting to explain how everything worked – so it surelywould also explain the essence that we call life. They were to be disappointed,but recent developments have raised the hopes of some scientists that the natureof first life might be explained by new levels of understanding about sub atomicbehaviour in biology.In 2004, these new ideas caused NASA to convene a workshop of leading scientiststo discuss the subject of ‘quantum life’ at their astrobiology laboratory inAmes, California, where discussion covered fields such as nanotechnology andquantum computation.Nanotechnology is concerned with the manufacture of artefacts or machines thatare assembled on an atom-by-atom basis. A nanometre is an almost unbelievablysmall unit of length. A human hair is typically about one 10,000th of a metre indiameter and a common cold virus is approximately one thousandth of this size. Atypical protein unit making up the coating of such a virus is typically tennanometres thick – equivalent to about 100 atomic diameters, or the size of oneof the amino acid groups making up that protein molecule.A whole new world of technology is envisaged from building self-replicatingmachines that could, for instance, carry out surgery at a cellular level insidethe human body. However, an increasing number of scientists are suggesting thatnature may have used this idea a long time ago. As Professor Paul Davies haspointed out, the living cell is full of nanomachines designed and refined bybiological evolution. And he posed the question: ‘Could it be that some of themacquired their amazing properties by deploying fancy quantum tricks?’36 He says:‘One vital part of a cell’s reproductive machinery is a little motor, called apolymerase enzyme, which crawls along unzipped strands of DNA and forges thelinks that match up the unpaired nucleotide bases with complementary basesfloating through its environment.’Apoorva Patel of the Indian Institute of Science, believes that living cells mayuse quantum mechanics to boost their information-processing efficiency, whichcould explain why the genetic code is the way it is, and why it is found in allorganisms. As Davies points out, quantum theory describes atoms and molecules aswaves, which can overlap and combine coherently – known as superposition. Thismeans that the normal rules of time/space do not apply and an atom can exist ina superposition of excited and unexcited states, or of states corresponding toseveral spatial locations at the same time. These superpositions are expected tobe the basis of quantum computers that will be able to hunt for a target among ajumble of data. This is said to be equivalent to finding a name in a telephonedirectory when you know only the phone number.The role of quantum theory in the origin of life is not yet clear. But it seemsthat the new technologies that humankind is now investigating may be at the rootof life itself. Paul Davies acknowledges that life somehow emerged from theferment of the quantum molecular world, and he adds:‘The role of quantum processes in living matter is still unclear. It is entirelypossible that quantum mechanics was the midwife of life, but has played aninsignificant role since… All scientists agree that life somehow emerged fromthe ferment of the quantum molecular world. The key issue is on which side ofthe quantum-classical divide the transition to life occurred. Niels Bohr oncesaid that anyone who is not shocked by quantum mechanics hasn’t understood it. Ibelieve that anyone who is not shocked by life hasn’t understood it. Thequestion before us is whether quantum mechanics is shocking enough to explainlife.’It seems to us that whoever seeded life on our planet, all those billions ofyears ago, was using a form of self-replicating ‘technology’ which willeventually come to be understood. And we might not be that far from thatunderstanding now."},{"pageContent":"WHO BUILT THE MOON?At this point we are as sure as we possibly can be that the following statementsare true: * The Moon is approximately 4.6 billion years old. * The Earth is approximately 4.6 billion years old. * The Moon was manufactured from lighter materials taken from the young Earth. * The Moon was made as an incubator to foster life on Earth. * The manufacturer of the Moon seeded life on Earth. * Evolution as described by Darwin is broadly accurate.The manufacturer of the Moon left deliberate messages, intended to be read byhumans at this point in geological time, to draw attention to what they havedone.It appears reasonable to assume that the manufacturer of the Moon (the UCA) hasa good reason for wanting humans to understand what was done. The UCA could haveseeded life and moved on, if its motive was pure altruism. It therefore seemsthat it is important to work out who built the Moon.It seems certain that we have only identified the first ‘introduction’ aspect ofthe message from the UCA. The details of the message are likely to hold the keyto the next phase of human development: information that will change our destinyforever.We believe that we have succeeded in identifying the key numbers that will beused in deeper layers of the detailed communication. We trust that others willtake up the challenge of interpreting other aspects of the message, but ourimmediate task is to try and work out who built the Moon.And we believe there are only three possibilities."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ELEVENCHILDHOOD’S END‘And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and thelesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.’Genesis 1:16, The King James BibleGood things and terrible things have always happened to mortal man. The warmthof spring, the survival of infants, the provision of animals to hunt, plants toharvest and freedom from disease must surely be the work of an unseen force withpowers far beyond than that of mere people. So too, the ills and woes of failedcrops, floods and death wrought upon whole tribes by war and desperate want. Itmust be the will of the gods.Thank the gods, fear the gods, appease the gods.Religion is as old as the stories that humans first told. From the early StoneAge to the Internet Age, humankind appears to need the power of deities thatinhabit an unseen world and yet have the power to affect the lives we live. Thegreatest love and the greatest hate spill forth in the name of gods.Today, the great religions of the world tend to describe the gods in thesingular as God, even though they all refer to many aspects under differentnames.The Hindu tradition has ideas that are increasingly seen as corresponding withmodern science. It perceives the existence of the cyclical nature of theUniverse and everything within it, where the cosmos follows one cycle within aframework of larger cycles. The Universe has been created and reached an end,but it represents only one turn in the perpetual ‘wheel of time’, which revolvesinfinitely through successive cycles of creation and destruction. This cycle ofcreation and destruction of the Universe could be seen as a series of Big Bangsand Big Crunches, where all matter explodes outwards from nowhere and thenrecedes back again. Within these gigantic cycles the soul also undergoes its owncycle, called samsara – where death and rebirth sees the same souls repeatedlyreincarnated.Meanwhile, Christianity is a broad church indeed, covering an incredible span ofbeliefs. At one end of the spectrum there are many scientific thinkers –including at least two Fellows of the Royal Society. One of them, JohnPolkinghorne, was a mathematical physicist before resigning his position as aprofessor at Cambridge University in 1979 to be ordained as priest in the Churchof England. Polkinghorne has since devoted his life to exploring the connectionsbetween science and theology, describing the Universe as open and flexible – aplace where patterns seem to exist and where he says the ‘providential aspect’cannot be ruled out.Many Christians fully support science and have no problem with evolution,quantum mechanics or the big bang origin of the Universe. For them it is simplya question of the authorship of the blueprint that obviously exists. Thedesigner of all this is their God. And yet they also believe in an event thatothers would find incredible. Without wishing to be disrespectful, we wouldprécis that event as follows: The initial intellect that created everythingbecame a man and died, nailed to a wooden post, some two thousand years ago,before briefly returning to human life and then transferring back to Hisethereal state somewhere outside of the physical world. This anthropoidinterlude for this creator deity (many billions of years after the start of theUniverse) is believed to compensate for the bad behaviour of those people whoaccept this story as real, thereby ensuring a pleasant continuation ofconsciousness after their physical body has ceased to be alive.At the other end of the Christian belief are the creationists. They hold that acollection of ancient Canaanite and Mesopotamian myths, from at least threeseparate traditions and first written down in the sixth century BC by Jewishpriests, are a literal account of how the world came into being. They take anuncomplicated view of life and consider that all species are unchanging andderive their forms from an unchanging, divine blueprint. To a creationist a roseis a rose is a rose, and it is foolish to think that a rose bush could become adaffodil, or an apple tree. They see God’s plan as timeless and unchanging, withseparate types of plants and animals that have nothing to connect them. For themthe world and everything within it was created in six days of a single week,somewhere around 4004 BC.It is of central importance to creationists that there is an absolute dividebetween humans and other animals. They often use the phrase ‘don’t let them makea monkey out of you’ in the mistaken belief that evolutionists claim that humansdeveloped from monkeys.Buddhist philosophy is evolutionary and in many ways agrees with mainstreamscientists. Buddha taught that all things are impermanent, constantly arising,becoming, changing and fading. Buddhist philosophers consequently rejected thePlatonic idea of production from ‘ideal forms’ as being the fallacy of‘production from inherently existent other’. According to most schools ofBuddhism there is nothing whatsoever that is inherently or independentlyexistent.Buddhist philosophers have always accepted that the Universe is billions ofyears old and they have no corresponding creation myth to that of theJudaeo-Christian tradition. Unlike creationists, Buddhists believe that bothhumans and animals possess sentient minds that survive death.There are many people today who are agnostic, meaning that they do not see anyproof of God but neither do they believe it to be impossible that there could bea God. Perhaps a small minority of the world are true atheists believing thatall matter, including their own self-awareness, is merely the culmination ofmultiple accidents occurring at random within the basic laws of physics.The classical argument for God has been that there must have been a ‘firstcause’ but this is considered to be invalid by relatively modern philosopherssuch as David Hume and Immanuel Kant, because the thesis is negated by its ownpremise. If everything must have a first cause then what made God? It thereforefollows that the Universe could arrive spontaneously just as much as God could.But, it occurs to us, what if God and the essence of the Universe were, and are,the same thing?"},{"pageContent":"GOD IN CONTACTHuman societies have probably always developed the idea that the world they seearound them must have a conscious mind behind it. And the Judaeo-Christiantradition holds that God has had quite regular contact, particularly with Hischosen people, from Adam through characters such as Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses,Ezekiel, Isaiah and John the Baptist (Jesus Christ cannot count because thatwould be God talking to Himself). Following the crucifixion of Jesus, God, ormembers of His ethereal team, are believed to have had contact with inspiredindividuals from St Paul to Joan of Arc, and there have been many miraculousappearances at locations such as Lourdes in France, Fatima in Portugal and Knockin Ireland.These visitations are held to be wonderful by believers and considered baloneyby others. Apart from the apparent miracle of existence itself, all otheraspects of God require faith. Faith could be described as intellectual beliefthat transcends normal standards of proof. In other words, the individual withfaith holds things to be true that are not evidenced in a form that rationalscience would accept.But what would happen if God suddenly turned up in an unambiguous way; if thecreator of the Universe appeared, in person, on the Earth with positive proof ofidentity?Logic says it could not happen because it is likely that only the agnosticswould be happy. Those who would be most likely to welcome the coming of God are,by definition, the people with the most complex belief systems. And every group(possibly except one) would be disappointed. Would Mormons be told they had itright after all or maybe Roman Catholics?; or maybe some followers of Mohammador Siddhartha Gautama or any one of the countless prophets down the ages.Imagine the Pope and the Dalai Lama sitting shaking their heads in disbelief asit turns out that the Australian Aboriginal people and those of the JapaneseShinto faith both had it right when they called God Izanagi. Surely, it wouldhave to be those with the most religion who would have the most to lose.But then, it is not likely that they are all correct in some way and that God isactually non-denominational. What if He now considers that the childhood of thehuman race is over and we are now grown up enough to be told the true mysteriesof existence – he might choose to make gentle contact to let us know that insome way ‘we had arrived’.It is our initial thought that the number patterns built into the Moon and itsrelationship with Earth, could be a first global contact with God Himself. Suchan event would change everything. If God formally made his presence known, whowould dare wage a war in His name? The world might listen carefully instead ofproclaiming its right to speak on His behalf from the churches, synagogues,mosques and temples around the globe.What evidence is there that this message could be from God?The first problem is one of definition. What do we mean when we speak of God?For recent convert, Anthony Flew, God is simply the creative force that does notinteract with people, but for many millions of others He is a benign fatherfigure who listens to their prayers.Upon reflection, the only way to deal with this point is to ignore it. If thehuman species has reached the end of its ‘childhood’, the nature of God will beappreciated in a new light anyway.The most fundamental case for the God scenario, when it comes to the message theMoon has to impart to us about its artificial construction, is that any entitywho created our world is God, almost by definition. Scriptures from all aroundthe world attribute the making of our planet and the heavens to a creative forcethat usually has a special relationship with humankind. That relationship is sospecial in Christianity that it is central to the very belief system that thecreator of our world actually became a man for thirty-three years some twomillennia ago.The fact that the numbers used in the Moon’s message are in base ten, impliesthat the UCA knew that the intelligent species that would evolve on Earth wouldhave ten fingers. God would know that. It is also clearly the case that the UCAknew that it would be at this particular point in the Earth’s history thathumans would be ready for the next stage of their relationship with God.The story told in the Book of Genesis in the Old Testament would turn out to beremarkably correct and even the Christian creationists would be right in part.‘In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.’In this scenario, God did create the Earth and the heavens, and by regulatingits attitude with the Moon caused it to have liquid water on its surface:‘And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of thedeep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.’In its early years the Moon was orbiting close to the Earth, gradually slowingdown both its own spin and producing a spin that gave regular days and nights:‘And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.And God saw the light,that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness. And God calledthe light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morningwere the first day.And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon theearth: and it was so. And God made two great lights; the greater light to rulethe day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.’The tilt of the Earth was held steady by the Moon and the Earth enjoyed regulardays, years and changing seasons:‘And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide theday from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days,and years.’The early Moon was huge and powerful as it orbited close to the Earth raisingcolossal tides every time it passed overhead. If the Moon had not been created,the seas of the Earth would cover virtually all of the planet leaving little dryland:‘And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let itdivide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided thewaters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above thefirmament: and it was so.’Thanks to its close proximity, the Moon’s tidal surges travelled far inland,constantly stirring the life-nurturing soup of the oceans, ready for the momentlife arrived. As more advanced life developed, plant life came first:‘And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and thefruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon theearth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seedafter his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after hiskind: and God saw that it was good.’The first animal life began in the oceans before spreading to land and into theair:‘And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature thathath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament ofheaven. And God created great whales, and every living creature that moveth,which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every wingedfowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters inthe seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth. And God said, Let the earth bringforth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beastof the earth after his kind: and it was so. And God made the beast of the earthafter his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth uponthe earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.’Millions and millions of creatures came and went, slowly changing into morecomplex life forms and eventually gaining intelligence and self-awareness. Onebranch of mammals climbed into the trees and later returned to the plains ashominids – our ancient, ape-like ancestors. There were many species of hominidthat learned to use primitive tools and that survived as hunter-gatherers. Asrecently as 25,000 years ago there were still three species of human: Homofloresienis, Homo neanderthalis and Homo sapiens. The Neanderthals had largerbrains than ours and we can be sure that they laughed and talked and cried –their burial practices even suggest that they may have had religious belief. Buttoday, we are alone:‘And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let themhave dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and overthe cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepethupon the earth. So God created man in his own image, in the image of God createdhe him; male and female created he them.And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, andreplenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea,and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon theearth.’The period during which we have learned to walk upright and have developed suchlarge brains that our Mothers risk their lives in giving birth to us, isminiscule in terms of the period the Earth has existed. It has taken us only acouple of million years in total. The amount of time we have been bright enoughto look with knowing eyes at our world has been much less than that, merely afew tens of thousands of years. We learned how to hunt and to survive from thebounty of nature and eventually we became farmers, living fixed lives andestablishing villages that became towns and eventually cities.Maybe six or seven thousand years ago something remarkable may have happened.Whoever or whatever had manufactured the Moon returned. In an operation thatpossibly involved a whole series of ‘visits’, the cipher necessary to crack thecode of the message, that had been so carefully encapsulated into the Moon, wasgiven to humanity. This ‘key’ was the Megalithic system of measurement andgeometry and specifically the Megalithic Yard. The Moon’s creator must have beenaware that if the Megalithic Yard was written into the stone circles and avenuesof what is now Britain and France, someone would eventually recover theinformation and rebuild the entire system in all its splendour.This was clearly not enough. Another series of visitations took place, not longafter the first but this time to another proto-civilization far from the first,between the rivers Tigress and Euphrates, in what is today the area known asIraq. Here a second system of mathematics and geometry was seeded, this one lessrelated to the mathematical certainties of the Earth and its relationship withthe Moon but more closely tied to everyday life. It was the forerunner of muchthat was to follow and when the rise of science came along, humanity inventedthe metric system, which almost eerily reflected what the Sumerians had been socarefully taught. The astronomer priests of Sumer were shown that the wholeworld, its size, mass and volume, could be derived from the most humble sourcepossible – a single seed of barley. (See Appendix Five.) This plant had clearlybeen genetically engineered not only to be of fantastic use to humanity but alsoto lock into the dimensions and mass of the Earth in an almost unbelievable way.Mythology and folklore tells us time and again that ‘messengers’ were sent inthe remote past to teach humanity the rudiments of civilization and we now knowwhy. None of this is beyond the capabilities of God and it is likely that apercentage of readers will already be convinced that this must be the solutionto the message contained in the Moon.God could quite easily have created the Moon and done so well within the laws ofphysics He had ordained. It would have been His deliberate intention that thelife He seeded on the young Earth would eventually give birth to a thinking,rational species that was, in some way, made in His own image. His interest inhumanity, when it eventually evolved, remained as He had quite clearly intended.We can see a situation in which the Deity sent messengers to lay the foundationsof an eventual recognition of the message which would lead to the first tangibleproof of the existence of a Creator.Nothing is beyond the mind or capability of God. We have endowed Him withunparalleled power and timelessness. But for countless generations the realityof God has resided in ‘faith’ rather than ‘proof’. Perhaps those with religionwill resent the suggestion that God has removed the need for faith.The humorous and thought-provoking writer, the late Douglas Adams, played withthis notion in his book The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy.37 Adams created aremarkable creature known as the Babel Fish, that when placed in anyone’s earcould act as an inter-galactic speech translator. So remarkable was theexistence of this little fish that people said it must stand as irrevocableproof of the existence of God because nothing so amazing could possibly comeabout by chance. However, it was pointed out that since God existed by faithalone – and not by proof – the absolute proof of his existence meant for certainthat he could not exist.‘I never thought of that,’ said God, and disappeared in a puff of logic.’It is clear that if we accept that God was responsible for creating the Moon andthat He specifically incorporated within it proof of what He had done, we mustbegin to look at Him in a very different light. In a world in which religion hasbeen diminishing in importance, and particularly in the technological West, anacceptance of God’s direct intervention in our part of the solar system mightsee thousands or millions of people flocking back to Church. The most ferventcreationists may abandon their insistence that the Earth is only a few thousandyears old and might accept that God did indeed work his magic through evolution.The recognition of God’s special pact with life, and especially with humanity,might fund a push towards ecumenicism and a coming together of the world’sfractious religions.Unfortunately it is equally likely that the reverse would happen becausepower-bases, religious or secular, have always shown a reluctance to diminish inimportance. Clearly, if we are looking at God’s true covenant with humanitythrough his intentional creation of the Moon, with its attendant and obviouslydeliberate messages, no existing belief pattern can be any more important thananother and the whole basis of religious dogma is in doubt.We could not criticize anyone who wishes to attribute the message to God. Butneither could we argue with anyone who says that God does not need to leavemessages coded into ancient stone circles that He already knows will eventuallybe recognized by humanity. If we are ultimately left in no doubt as to hisexistence, the whole procedure has been somewhat unnecessary. God is capable ofshowing Himself to humanity at any time He chooses, with absolutely no ambiguityor the remotest uncertainty.Everything about the Moon and its addition to the solar system seems to speak ofa message that ‘must’ be imparted one day and of a series of deliberate‘humanlike’ interventions that would ensure this was the case.Further to this, we might argue that the Moon was almost certainly added to ourpart of the solar system as an afterthought. It had to be, because the verymaterial from which it was made came from the already existent Earth. God couldquite easily have made the Earth a haven for life in its own right. It has to beremembered that it was the ‘shortcomings’ of the Earth that necessitated theaddition of the Moon to the planetary system. Surely the God of the humanimagination is all-powerful and has no shortcomings.We cannot deny that a world in which humanity was certain of the existence ofGod, and in which there was no longer any doubt about what He represented,‘might’ become a more cohesive and peaceful place and we did not turn away fromthis possibility lightly. However, we have tried to approach our research from agenuinely scientific point of view (we would argue that our approach is morescientific and less based on enshrined belief than that of many so-calledscientists.) This being said, we felt ourselves obliged to look at otherpossible solutions to the questions raised by the evidence we had amassed. Thosewho wish to attribute the creation of the Earth– Moon system to God willcontinue do so, though we felt it impossible to stop searching. We are cognisantthat by His sheer timeless power God can be used as a cure-all to answer anyquestion. That has been the pattern of humanity across the ages and it is notone we feel constrained to follow.In short, there are other possibilities that might prove to be just assurprising but considerably more plausible."},{"pageContent":"POSTSCRIPT TO THIS CHAPTERThis chapter was completed during the closing days of 2004. On the morning ofSunday December 26th an Earthquake five miles beneath the ocean floor, west ofSumatra, produced a tsunami with the power of more than 10,000 atomic bombs.Travelling at speeds of up to 800 kilometres an hour it tore into coastal areasall around the Indian Ocean causing devastation that was as sudden as it wasterrible. Many tens of thousands of people died within minutes and millions morewere left to grieve for their lost loved ones and to struggle against hunger,thirst and the threat of consequential disease.The event was so powerful that the entire Earth moved.Geologist Kerry Sieh of the California Institute of Technology said ‘It causedthe planet to wobble a little bit.’ As the Indian Ocean’s heavy tectonic platelurched underneath the Indonesian plate there was a shift of mass towards theplanet’s centre, causing the globe to rotate faster and shortening the period ofour planet’s rotation by some three microseconds. A team of researchers atNASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California also found that theincident caused the Earth’s tilt to be increased by 2.5cm.The mobility of the Earth’s crust was central to the emergence of life and nowthe residual shifting of tectonic plates causes death and destruction to thosetoo near to the event. If the careful design of the Earth and its Moon were thework of God, His life-bringing mechanisms are, in this instance at least,working against the interests of His chosen species.The events in the Indian Ocean horrified the world. In Britain the Archbishop ofCanterbury, who leads the Church of England, was deeply troubled. Dr RowanWilliams, writing eight days later in the Sunday Telegraph questioned the natureof God’s interaction with humans:‘The question: “How can you believe in a God who permits suffering on thisscale?” is therefore very much around at the moment, and it would be surprisingif it weren’t – indeed, it would be wrong if it weren’t. The traditional answerswill get us only so far. God, we are told, is not a puppet-master in regardeither to human actions or to the processes of the world. If we are to exist inan environment where we can live lives of productive work and consistentunderstanding – human lives as we know them – the world has to have a regularorder and pattern of its own. Effects follow causes in a way that we can chart,and so can make some attempt at coping with. So there is something odd aboutexpecting that God will constantly step in if things are getting dangerous. Howdangerous do they have to be? How many deaths would be acceptable?So why do religious believers pray for God’s help or healing? They ask for God’saction to come in to a situation and change it, yes; but if they are honest,they don’t see prayer as a plea for magical solutions that will make the worldtotally safe for them and others.All this is fair enough, perhaps true as far as it goes. But it doesn’t go veryfar in helping us, one week on, with the intolerable grief and devastation infront of us. If some religious genius did come up with an explanation of exactlywhy all these deaths made sense, would we feel happier or safer or moreconfident in God? Wouldn’t we feel something of a chill at the prospect of a Godwho deliberately plans a programme that involves a certain level of casualties?’If a single entity that we could reasonably call God did indeed establish theEarth and its Moon so that we might evolve, He might be obliged to work withinHis own rules of the Universe. Creating a life-bearing planet required aploughing of the surface and this is a process that cannot be switched on andoff like a light switch. Dr Williams presumably has a problem because hebelieves in a God who is in on-going contact – a God who can choose to respondto individual prayers. But maybe the situation is not like that.The title we chose for this chapter is ‘Childhood’s End’. This seemed to be afitting summation for the discussion of the possibility that God had made theworld and had, from the outset, built into it a message that we would understandwhen we were sufficiently emotionally and intellectually mature. We were awarethat Arthur C Clarke had written a novel with this title more than half acentury earlier with a very different but not unconnected theme.Sir Arthur is an inspired writer and his ideas expressed in 2001: A SpaceOdyssey, have been discussed in this book. When we realized that the IndianOcean tsunami had caused a massive loss of life in Sri Lanka, we were concernedfor him, because we were aware that he is wheelchair bound in his home near thebeach in Colombo. Thankfully Sir Arthur was not hurt and was able to write anaccount of what had happened in his adopted country.He wrote: ‘I have no idea if God had any scenario in mind when this happened. Ina way, the disaster was a random event, but at the same time nothing in thisworld is totally random, there is always cause and effect.’All of this could very much describe a God who has a working plan that appearsto be less than perfect. Tectonic plates were necessary to create us but theircurrent movements are simply a small, incidental effect of a far greater cause.Are we to believe that in the mind of God the ultimate end justifies thesometimes very painful means?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER TWELVEEXTRA TERRESTRIALS‘…it’s entirely possible, in my view, that we could retrieve a message fromanother world within just a few decades…’Seth Shostak – Senior Astronomer, SETIThe idea that intelligent creatures might exist somewhere else in the cosmos hasfascinated humanity ever since the invention of the telescope revealed that ourworld is but one amongst countless others. At first some people wondered ifthere were people living around the supposed seas on the Moon and others fearedinvasion from near neighbours, particularly Mars.In 1858 an Italian astronomer called Secchi announced that he had seen ‘canali’on the surface of Mars, and in 1877 Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, anastronomer at the Milan Observatory, produced drawings of these features. Thoughthe most accurate translation of the Italian word ‘canali’ would have been‘channels’, it was translated into English as ‘canals’. With the completion ofthe Suez Canal fresh in people’s minds, the interpretation was taken to meanthat huge artificial waterways had been discovered – which amounted to evidenceof intelligent life.Debate raged over the findings, with Schiaparelli himself stating that there wasno reason to suppose that the canals were artificial. The discovery sparked theimagination of a young man named Percival Lowell who was at the beginning ofwhat was to be a distinguished career in astronomy. He was one of the first torealize that it was far more sensible to site observatories in out-of -the-wayplaces, such as deserts or on mountaintops, where smoke and light spillage fromcities would not diminish the astronomers view of the heavens. He was thedriving force behind the creation of the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff,Arizona, in 1894.Professor Lowell studied linear features on Mars with his twenty-four-inchtelescope and developed theories about the habitability of Mars, based on hisestimate that the planet had an average temperature of 48°F. The LowellObservatory made consistent observations of the Martian canals and Lowellpersonally maintained that the linear features were indeed of artificial origin.When spacecraft reached Mars, scientists expected to discover what the canalsreally were but they found that there were no canals and almost no straightlines on the planet at all. We have to conclude that either the Martians havecamouflaged them rather well over the last century or, infinitely more likely, ageneration of astronomers were imagining things at the limits of their opticaltelescopes.The idea that there could be real Martians was a popular worry that wasbrilliantly used as the plot by H G Wells in his novel War of the Worlds.A wave of mass hysteria gripped thousands of radio listeners in October 1938,when a dramatization of this book was broadcast and led unsuspecting listenersto believe that an interplanetary conflict had started, with invading Martiansspreading death and destruction across New Jersey and New York.The next day the New York Times reported on the scare:‘A weather report was given, prosaically. An announcer remarked that the programwould be continued from a hotel, with dance music. For a few moments a danceprogram was given in the usual manner. Then there was a “break-in” with a“flash” about a professor at an observatory noting a series of gas explosions onthe planet Mars.News bulletins and scene broadcasts followed, reporting, with the technique inwhich the radio had reported actual events, the landing of a “meteor” nearPrinceton N. J., “killing” 1,500 persons, the discovery that the “meteor” was a“metal cylinder” containing strange creatures from Mars armed with “death rays”to open hostilities against the inhabitants of the earth.’By far the majority of experts now accept that if advanced life of any sort doesexist in places other than the Earth, we will almost certainly have to looktowards interstellar space in order to find it. But our greater knowledge ofouter space has not quelled the public’s appetite for close-encounter stories.The famous Roswell incident is believed by many to be an extra-terrestrialencounter. It is said that a UFO crashed in the New Mexico desert in July 1947and the debris was removed to an army base in Fort Worth, Texas.A US government cover-up is said to have tried to pass off the event by statingthat the debris was actually part of a radar unit from a weatherballoon.Rumours about the existence of secret alien bases located in various places,such as the Moon, under the ocean, or in a tropical rain forest have persisted.Some people have gone so far as to claim that they have worked on secret UFOprojects for the government and seen UFOs at military installations.According to a recent poll, some three million Americans believe that they haveencountered bright lights and incurred strange bodily marks indicative of apossible encounter with aliens. Psychological tests confirm that these‘abductees’ are rarely psychotic or mentally ill in any usual sense of the term.It makes us wonder whether humans are simply prone to having some kind of neuraldysfunction involving optical illusions. Maybe the decline of old-style beliefin mythical creatures like fairies and goblins and in religious imagery such asangels or the Virgin Mary, has caused people to have new kinds ofhallucinations. Where people once thought they saw the ‘little people’ dancingin a circle of light or a heavenly messenger with a glowing halo, the brightlights in their heads are now translated as alien contact.Whilst the debate continues about everything from Roswell to crop circles, ithas to be admitted that there has never been any proof of alien contact – and itis, of course, impossible to prove the negative. However, the probability ofcontact does seem extremely small, given the vast amounts of space and timeinvolved.The solar system, of which the Earth forms a small part, is only one of manyeven in our own corner of our galaxy – the Milky Way. Astronomers haveidentified stars that definitely have planets orbiting them, so the state ofaffairs within our own solar system is certainly not unique. An interestingfinding has been that larger, gaseous planets in other star systems, much likeJupiter and Saturn in our own, have been discovered to have an orbit that isalways very close to their host star. From these early indications it seems thatour planetary arrangement is unique, which just might not be accidental.It is a fact that if Jupiter were not just over five times more distant from theSun than we are, advanced life on Earth would not exist. This giant planet ispositioned as a ‘catcher’ of space objects that would otherwise impact into theEarth. A dramatic example of this was seen in July 1994, when twenty-onefragments of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 smashed into Jupiter at speeds of up tohalf a million kilometres and hour, creating fireballs larger than the planetEarth.If we are right about the Moon being constructed to act as an incubator, themanufacturer would have been pleased to note that Jupiter and Saturn were invery unusual and perhaps unique outer orbits. If it were not so, they would haveto have caused them to be in this position – which would suggest that the entiresolar system could have been designed for the benefit of humankind!Whether or not our solar system is a happy accident, it is estimated that thereare a thousand million other stars in our galaxy alone, any one of which couldpossess a planetary system where life might have evolved and even flourished.Beyond our galaxy there must be stars with Earth-like planets beyond counting.Bearing these facts in mind, it surely appears unreasonable to believe that onlyour tiny little green planet is alone in producing a self-aware species.However as we have previously noticed, setting out to actually meet ourintergalactic or extragalactic cousins seems hopeless, even if we knew wherethey were located. But this may not be the end of the story.Time is not a fixed concept. If a person could travel close to the speed oflight, they would experience a severe slowdown in time, relative to a slowermoving object. At light speed, time stops completely, relative to somethingmoving at a much lesser speed. Because of this ‘time stop’, a photon thattravels at the speed of light would not experience distance and time in thenormal way. So from the photon’s point of view, it could go from one end of theUniverse to the other instantly, while from an outside point of view it wouldtake about thirteen billion years.Still stranger, scientists have found the need to speculate about the existenceof a particle called a ‘tachyon’ that can travel faster than light. Buttheoretically at least, travelling faster than light would result in anindividual going backwards in time. So the tachyon is something of a mystery atthe moment, with scientists having to calculate the activity of these particleswith time working in reverse.So, just maybe, there will be ways to work around the problem of travelling atspeeds close to, or even above, the speed of light.Next, there is the possibility of intergalactic communication using whatphysicists call ‘quantum entanglement’, that can happen to sub atomic particles.If quarks with identical spin are paired and separated, and the spin of one ischanged, the other changes its spin instantaneously to match that of its partner– no matter how far apart they are separated. Einstein called this phenomenon‘spooky distance’, and it suggests that some force, not yet understood, must becapable of travelling in folded space in some manner or may not exist at all inspace as we know it, and therefore not be restricted to the effects of travel.It is therefore not inconceivable that other advanced creatures have found a wayto bridge the chasm of space-time between their planet and ours. But we are notable to deal with such technology yet, even though we can envisage itsexistence. Right now, as far as we know, we cannot greet them face to face, butas we pointed out in Chapter Eight it might be possible to listen to them oreven talk to them.As we have also noted, recent publications by leading academics such as PaulDavies, Christopher Rose and Gregory Wright, are suggesting that physicalartefacts are a far better way of communicating across the vastness of space.Paul Davies has stated that a far more reliable way for any alien species tocontact us would be to leave artefacts in the vicinity of planets likely tospawn intelligent life that, given sufficient advancement on the part of such adeveloping species, it could not fail to recognize.And so, the question that confronts us is: Could aliens have built the Moon fromthe very substance of the Earth in order to allow our development, and then lefta physical message of what they had done in the very dimensions and movements ofthe bodies?We believe that the message we have detected in the Moon and its relationship tothe Earth is so amazingly differentiated from the ‘background noise’ of allother measurements that it forms a breakthrough for humanity. Certainly, if amessage of such clarity and consistency was received from beyond our planet bymeans of good old-fashioned electromagnetic radiation, the personnel at SETIwould be jumping up and down with joy.If the message from the UCA is attributable to aliens we have already speculatedthat its motive could simply be a desire to progressively transform the matterin the Universe from a chaotic condition to an ordered state of self-awareness.One can image that, given enough time, all of the matter in existence could beunited in a single thinking entity. Astronomer Royal, Sir Fred Hoyle, wrote anovel called The Black Cloud38 in which he speculated about a cloud of spacematter that had such instantaneous interaction between its particles it was,effectively, a single living entity. Could this be the long-term goal for allintelligence? If so, we will need to understand what has happened in the case ofour own planet much more clearly so that we will be able, in due course, to takepart in this ultimate mission for the Universe.If we accept alien intervention in our distant past, we have to ask how thesevisitors from elsewhere could have known that the fruits of their labours wouldcome to have ten fingers and therefore work in base ten. A possible answer isthat all successful life forms come to intellectual maturity with thesecharacteristics, but the whole notion does seem odd.Furthermore, there is the problem of how the alien Moon builders came to useMegalithic geometry and kilometres to incorporate elements of the message. Thistoo seems unusual. What is more, as we have observed, there appear to have beenvisits to the Earth by the UCA in much more recent times. This would suggestthat the alien visitors, having manufactured the Moon, would have had to returnto the Earth over four billion years later in order to pass the Megalithicmessage onto the developing human culture in Britain and France. We find itdifficult to imagine a culture or society that could endure for such a vastperiod of time. It is much more likely that such a civilization would have gonethe way of inevitable evolution, managed somehow to destroy itself, or simplygrown bored with the whole experiment in only a tiny fraction of the timeinvolved.If readers wish to believe that aliens are responsible for this message, wewould have to say that this is a theory worthy of further investigation. For ourpart, we can see no direct proof that this has been the case, and there seem tobe factors involved that make the alien hypothesis unlikely to be the answer weare seeking. However, there is a third, and altogether more amazing option yetto consider and it is one that appears to fit the bill in every respect."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13THE MÖBIUS PRINCIPLE‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness’God: Genesis 1:26For those people who call themselves creationists, the Bible is the word of God.But which Bible is the authentic one? There are countless versions of the bookscontained in both the Old and New Testaments and the oldest versions have beencarefully dissected to reveal the different styles of authorship woven into thefabric of the stories. Two of the three main traditions – the Yahwist and theElohim (a word meaning gods in the plural) – talk of a specific sequence ofcreation. This deals with the arrival of plants, then good and evil, thenanimals and next women.The third, priestly tradition has a sequence of creation that is rather more inline with modern theories about evolution. First comes light followed by heaven,the Earth (land and then sea), vegetation, then the Sun, Moon and stars. Nextcome birds and fishes and finally man and women together.An interesting fact is that the first two traditions use the Hebrew yàsar forthe creative act of making man, which has a simplistic or crude implication ofbeing shaped, as a potter models clay objects. Both also use the word demut forlikeness, which implies similarity or looking the same. However, in the Priestlytradition, (the version that has God talking to his wider council about makingman in their image) He uses a very different word. In this case the word bàrà isused for the creation of man and this is a word that carries a more complex,creative value. Next we find selem as the chosen word for the use of thecreator’s image, which means something more like a precise duplicate. Selem is aterm directly related to the Canaanite word for Venus that is associated withresurrection and therefore rebirth of the individual.39We find it strange that a supposedly singular God is talking to others aroundhim, even before humans have been created. He has already made the Sun, Moon andEarth and supplied the oceans along with plant and animal life – but to whom ishe talking? And why do they all, whoever ‘they’ are (including God Himself)apparently have heads with noses, ears and eyes, bodies with arms and legs andpresumably even genitalia?Why is God, along with his undisclosed team, human in appearance?It is not our place here to try and make sense of Judaeo-Christian myth, but wecame to find the idea fascinating and surprisingly plausible. The Bible has beenedited, changed and added to by a succession of people who wanted it to supportwhatever they deemed to be true. Early Christians even accused the Jews ofhaving incorrect versions of their own scriptures when they were found to differfrom the texts the early Christians had doctored. In terms of Christianity, itseems unlikely that a passage that involves God talking to others before hecreated humanity would have survived, had it not been for an important aspect ofthe new Christian faith. This was the ‘new’ concept of the trinity – where Godis said to comprise three separate entities including his living human mode asJesus.We are not attempting to claim that the Bible provides us with any evidence forthe authorship of the message we had discovered, but a close look at thesituation did lead us to a tantalizing thought.Could the only known intelligent life force in the Universe be responsible forthe message? To be blunt: Could modern humans have built the Moon?There is obviously one very substantial issue of logic to address here, which isobviously the time gap of 4.6 billion years between the creation of the Moon andthe present era. Clearly, if humanity created the Moon, this would have to beexplained. In reality, this may not be the obstacle it appears to be, becauseleading scientists are currently debating the possibility of travellingbackwards in time. Virtually everyone speculating about time travel is agreedthat the associated mathematics indicates it should be possible. We will come tothe problem of travelling in time shortly, but for the moment let us put theissue of the time gap aside and consider the reasons why the Moon’s messagemight be from closer to home than we ever dreamed could be possible.The hypothesis we originally laid down was: 1. The Moon was engineered by an unknown agency circa 4.6 billion years ago to act as an incubator to promote intelligent life on Earth. 2. The unknown agency knew that humanoids would be the result of the evolutionary chain. 3. That unknown agency wanted the resulting humanoids to know what had been done and they left a message indicated by the dynamics of the Moon and its relationship with the Earth.Firstly, it has to be acknowledged that there are no other possible candidatesthat we know of anywhere in the Universe. God exists by faith and not as aresult of evidence, and aliens may or may not exist. It is entirely possiblethat we are totally alone, either in our part of space or in the whole of theUniverse. In any case, who would have more to gain from a life-producing planetthan the very intelligent creature that has most benefited from its existence,namely humanity?The question of how the UCA could have known that the intelligent species onEarth would evolve with ten fingers and therefore adopt base-ten arithmetic, ata time when the Moon was exactly where it is today, is answered instantly ifhumanity is the agency we are seeking. The mystery simply dissolves if we arethat unknown creative agency.Another difficult issue to explain has been how the UCA could possibly have usedMegalithic and metric units as part of the message. Once again, this scenarioresolves the problem. Indeed, it adds to the message because it makes it veryclear that the UCA ‘has to be’ humans from our future, travelling back in timeto manufacture the Moon.The motive for the message becomes obvious and absolutely necessary. If humansdo not become alerted to the need to manufacture the Moon as an incubator forlife – we would not be here.However, there is the problem we can’t avoid. Humanity might be described ashaving been reasonably technologically advanced for around 100 years. The Mooncame into being some 4,600,000,000,000 years ago. We have to admit that thisdoes represent a bit of a gap.The answer can only be time travel."},{"pageContent":"TOMORROW’S YESTERDAYTime is perceived as flowing like a river from the past into the future and weare all riding the wave in one direction. But what if it were possible to headback upstream? Not necessarily for humans themselves, though that cannot beruled out, but for pre-programmed super-machines; equipment so sophisticatedthat it could engineer planetary-sized objects. After all, most spacecraft todayare unmanned units that carry out all kinds of experiments, take photographs andeven analyse samples of alien rock. It would not therefore be hard to imagine aproject team from our relatively near future designing and deploying‘chronobots’40 to construct key elements of the past.But is time travel a dream or a possible reality?For most people such thoughts cause headaches. The question that anyone willreasonably focus upon is: If humans went back in time to build the Moon so thatthere would be humans – where did humans come from?It seems like an impossible loop – but is it stranger than the age-old conundrumabout the chicken and the egg? Logically, it is necessary to have a chicken tolay an egg, yet one needs an egg for that chicken to have sprung from. Acreationist would have no problem as their God manufactured the first chickenwith an ability to lay eggs. The evolutionists would be a little sneakier andsay that a creature that was not quite a chicken laid an egg that produced amutation that was the first proper chicken. So, the egg came first.It really is not worth losing sleep about such problems, as the only way to dealwith any paradox is to simply accept it.Today, we are programmed with a need for neat, predictable Newtonian-stylelogic. Simple cause and effect – so that if ‘A’ happens ‘B’ will result. Peopleeverywhere seem willing to accept the idea that we were either created by God,or that we exist due to a mega-series of flabbergastingly beneficial accidents.Look at these two possibilities again and then ask yourself if it is any morefar-fetched or unreasonable to suggest that, as a species, we went back tocreate our own life-giving planet system and ultimately ourselves? (For somereason, to the religiously-minded, the insurmountable question of ‘Who madeGod?’ can be safely ignored, as can the ridiculous improbability of aninfinitely flowing stream of beneficial serendipity to non-believers).Humans throughout history have generally had a psychological need for a higherauthority, whether it be a supreme deity or the laws of physics. Thankfully,that is not necessarily the whole story at all.The debate about time travel goes on amongst the experts as it has done for manydecades. Generally speaking, philosophers don’t care for the idea, for a wholehost of logical or illogical reasons, though some of them are coming round inthe face of the latest evidence. Meanwhile physicists are becoming increasinglycertain that time travel is possible, and they have the mathematics to back upwhat is far from being a simple hunch.Whilst the idea of travelling into the past is so counterintuitive for mostpeople that they just cannot get their heads around it, a physics heavyweightand a philosophy heavyweight from Oxford University have another view. They onceteamed up to confront the apparent paradox that seems to forbid the highly fluidpresent penetrating the apparently frozen structure of the past. David Deutschand Michael Lockwood have the problem in context; saying about the quantumphysics of time travel: ‘Common sense may rule out such excursions – but thelaws of physics do not.’41Most people have a real problem with the idea of time travel, and the so-called‘grandfather paradox’ encapsulates why the idea appears to assault common senseso strongly. The idea is that if a young man was able to travel back from thepresent time to, say, 1950, he might kill, or cause his grandfather to be killedbefore his own father was born. If this were to happen, it would mean that hecould not exist and therefore could not have killed his grandfather. The problemjust goes around in apparently impossible circles. The only solution appears, atfirst view, to be to consider all such journeys as utterly impossible – if forno other reason than to save us from terminal confusion!However, Deutsch and Lockwood are not so easily fazed and they remainunconvinced about the need to protect our sensibilities from issues of realityjust because laypeople tend to become confused. In an article published inScientific American they discuss another apparent time paradox that deals withthe possibility that even knowledge does not seem to require a beginning.They refer to the grandfather-killing scenario as being an ‘inconsistencyparadox’ and then they discuss another type of apparent time-traveller violationof logic that they call a ‘knowledge paradox’. This is an apparent violation ofthe principle that knowledge can only come into existence as a result ofproblem-solving processes, such as biological evolution or human thought. In theexample, they talk about a hypothetical art critic who goes back in time tovisit a famous artist from the previous century who, the critic realizes, isonly producing very mediocre work. The time traveller shows the painter a bookcontaining reproductions of his later and greater works, which he then proceedsto carefully copy in every detail with oil paints onto canvas. This means thatthe reproductions in the book exist because they are copied from the paintingsand the paintings exist because they were copied from the reproductions. So,where did the inspiration come from?‘This kind of puzzling paradox,’ say Deutsch and Lockwood, ‘once causedphysicists to invoke a chronology principle that, by fiat alone, ruled outtravel into the past.’ But they believe that travelling into the past does notviolate any principle of physics, however much it seems counterintuitive to theaverage person. Furthermore, the Oxford duo state that quantum-mechanicaleffects actually facilitate time travel rather than prevent it, as somescientists once argued.They explain the basics of the concept of time by pointing to Einstein’s specialand general theories of relativity where three-dimensional space is combinedwith time to form four-dimensional space-time. Within this, everyone’s lifeforms a kind of four-dimensional ‘worm’ in space-time, with the tip of theworm’s tail corresponding to their birth and the top of the head to the person’sdeath. The line along which the ‘worm’ lies is called the person’s (or object’s)‘worldline’ and each moment of time is a cross section of that worldline.Einstein’s general theory of relativity predicts that massive bodies, such asstars and black holes, distort space-time and bend worldlines. This is believedto be the origin of gravity – and, for example, the Earth’s worldline spiralsaround that of the Sun, which in turn spirals around that of the centre of ourgalaxy. Deutsch and Lockwood propose that if space-time becomes really distortedby gravity some worldlines would become closed loops where they would continueto conform to all the familiar properties of space and time in their ownlocality, yet they would become corridors to the past. They state:‘If we tried to follow such a Closed Timelike Curve (or CTC) exactly, all theway around, we would bump into our former selves and get pushed aside. But byfollowing part of a CTC, we could return to the past and participate in eventsthere. We could shake hands with our younger selves or, if the loop were largeenough, visit our ancestors. To do this, we should either have to harnessnaturally occurring CTCs or create CTCs by distorting and tearing the fabric ofspace-time. So a time machine, rather than being a special kind of vehicle,would provide a route to the past, along which an ordinary vehicle, such as aspacecraft, could travel.’42So, world-class physicists like Professor Deutsch can conceive of potentiallygiant spacecraft voyaging backwards in time. Perhaps such craft could be filledwith chronobots that could even self-replicate to take on a task that might takehundreds of thousands, or even millions, of years. Building an object the sizeof the Moon with pre-programmed orbital requirements is unlikely to be a quickexercise. But time would literally be on their side.There are various ideas about how these time-travel enabling CTCs might beformed. The mathematician Kurt Gödel found a solution to Einstein’s equationsthat describes CTCs within a rotating Universe and they also appear in solutionsof Einstein’s equations describing rotating black holes. But there are manypractical problems including the evidence that naturally occurring black holesare not spinning fast enough. Maybe a technique will one day be found toincrease their rotation rate until safe CTCs appear.The physicist John A Wheeler from Princeton University has famously suggestedshortcuts through space-time that he calls ‘wormholes’, and other scientistshave shown how two ends of a wormhole could be moved, so as to form a CTC.Professor Deutsch has become a champion of the many-Universes theory, first putforward by Hugh Everett III in 1957, where everything that can happen doeshappen. For this reason, the supposed paradoxes of time travel simply do notexist. In the scenario where the man kills his grandfather, he does not exist inthe one single Universe where the murder is committed, but he does in the oneswhere he fails to assassinate his forebear.Deutsch and Lockwood conclude that there is no scientific objection to timetravel, saying in their article:‘The idea that time travel paradoxes could be resolved by “parallel Universes”has been anticipated in science fiction and by some philosophers. What we havepresented here is not so much a new resolution as a new way of arriving at it,by deducing it from existing physical theory… These calculations definitivelydispose of the inconsistency paradoxes, which turn out to be merely artifacts ofan obsolete, classical worldview.’They appear to be suggesting a loop in time that has a twist in it so thatcontact is made with a near identical parallel existence, through which the timetraveller can arrive at a time and place that always has them present.Their thought-provoking article concludes with the authors pointing out thatscience says time travel is theoretically possible. As a result, the onus is onthose who wish to argue otherwise to prove their case:‘We conclude that if time travel is impossible, then the reason has yet to bediscovered. We may or may not one day locate or create navigable CTCs. But ifanything like the many-Universes picture is true – and in quantum cosmology andthe quantum theory of computation no viable alternative is known – then all thestandard objections to time travel depend on false models of physical reality.So it is incumbent on anyone who still wants to reject the idea of time travelto come up with some new scientific or philosophical argument.’And many experts agree. Physicist, Matt Visser of Victoria University ofWellington, has compiled a short list of the time travel opportunities that haveturned up since Einstein showed us how to warp space-time. He has said thatEinstein’s general theory of relativity not only allows time machines to exist,it is ‘completely infested with them’.Others fear the concept of time travel, even though they have not been able todemonstrate that it cannot be done. ‘I think most of us would like to get rid oftime machines if we possibly could,’ says Amanda Peet of the University ofToronto. ‘They offend our fundamental sensibilities.’The only argument that has been made against time travel comes from the famousCambridge phycisist, Stephen Hawking, in the form of his ‘chronology protectionconjecture’. This suggestion boils down to the notion that the Universe mighthave a built-in time cop, so whenever anyone is on the verge of constructing aworking time machine the time cop turns up and shuts the operation down beforeit has a chance to damage the past. However, there are no time cops evident inthe laws of physics, so, at the moment, the chronology protection conjecture issimply wishful thinking.As far as our scenario is concerned, humans exist because, at some future point,we will return to the time when our planet was a young lump of unstratifiedmatter and then we shall make the Moon.Once complete, our Moon worked its magic and life began, evolving eventuallyinto an intelligent, ten-fingered species that uses Megalithic and metric units.The message had to be built into the very nature of the structure or else wewould miss the cue to understand what we need to do.But how can we do it and when will we do it?Ronald Mallett, a Professor of Theoretical Physics at Connecticut University,already believes he has found a way to create a CTC or time machine using light.He has identified that a circulating beam of light, slowed right down to asnail’s pace, may well be the key to the door of time travel because, althoughlight has no mass it does bend space. The realization that time, as well asspace, might be twisted by circulating light beams caused Mallett to team upwith other scientists at Connecticut University in 2001, with the intention ofbuilding a prototype, saying, ‘With this device time travel may become apractical possibility.’Mallett decided that if he added a second light beam, circulating in theopposite direction to the first, it would increase the intensity of the lightenough to cause space and time to swap roles. Inside the circulating light beam,time runs round and round, and, what to an outsider appears to be time becomeslike an ordinary dimension of space. A person walking along in the rightdirection could actually be walking backwards in time – as measured outside thecircle. So after walking for a while, you could leave the circle and meetyourself before you have entered it.However, it turns out that the energy needed to twist time into a loop isenormous, and when Mallett reviewed his progress he realized that the effect ofcirculating light depends on its velocity: the slower the light, the strongerthe distortion in space-time.By strange good fortune, Lene Hau, a phycisist at Harvard University, has slowedlight from the usual 300,000km per second to just a few metres per second, andalmost frozen its progress completely. Mallett was ecstatic saying, ‘The slowlight opens up a domain we just haven’t had before. All you need is to have thelight circulate in one of these media.’Maybe current scientists will crack the problem of time travel but it seemslogical to expect the necessary instructions to be contained in the deeper layerof the Moon’s message. However, it seems likely that black holes may be at theroot of the technology required.The black holes of deep space are the gravitational remains of dead stars. Theyare super-dense, bottomless pits in both space and time that are capable ofsucking in almost infinite amounts of material, including light. Everything ablack hole swallows gets compressed into an unimaginably tiny central regioncalled a ‘singularity’ in which the atoms are crushed into an unmoving whole. Ifthe Earth were to become as dense as a black hole, it would be smaller than agolf ball. (And they say you can’t compress water!)There seems to be no way to get any information about what is happening inside ablack hole, as even light is trapped inside. However, Cambridge physicistStephen Hawking proposed a way in which black holes do radiate matter and slowlydissipate until they eventually disappear in a final mega-burst of radiation.Amazingly, scientists are becoming increasingly confident that they will be ableto create black holes on demand using the new atom-smashers due to come on linein 2007. It is believed that the new Large Hadron Collider (LHC) being builtastride the Franco-Swiss border west of Geneva by the European Centre forNuclear Research (CERN) will be able to create black holes at the rate of oneper second. The LHC is an accelerator which will bombard protons and antiprotonstogether, with such a force that the collision will create temperatures andenergy densities not seen since the first trillionth of a second after the bigbang. This should be enough to pop off numerous tiny black holes, with masses ofjust a few hundred protons. Black holes of this size will evaporate almostinstantly, their existence detectable only by dying bursts of Hawking radiation.This work is at an early stage but it may well prove to be the beginnings of aplatform that could drive the search for the technology to enable time travel.If humans from our future did travel to the distant past to create the incubatorthat would produce our own species, it does make complete sense of the messageleft to us. We have to imagine that our ability to complete such an awesome taskmust be hundreds or even thousands of years ahead of our current level ofcapabilities. However, what if the instructions of how to proceed were containedinside the message itself? If this was the case, the development time might becut to a minimum.Maybe a question we should be asking ourselves is why the message was socarefully timed to reveal itself at this particular time. Could it be that wehave so far only seen what is little more than a ‘waving flag’ to alert us to agreater message that tells us exactly what must be done in order to fulfill ourown destiny? Maybe the central pattern revealed by the mutual orbits of theEarth and its Moon and, quite separately, by the relative sizes of 366.3 x 27.3= 10,000 is the most fundamental key of all.At this stage there are two entirely separate questions that need to beanswered: 1. To what are we to apply the cipher? 2. If humans created the Moon as an incubator for life, where did the seeds for germination come from?The answer to both final elements of this ultimate riddle may well rest in thesame place: DNA."},{"pageContent":"THE SECRETS OF THE GENOMEThe Human Genome Project, completed in 2003, was a thirteen-year mission tounravel the secrets of the minute data store that carries all the informationneeded to make a human being, what we call DNA. The key goals of the projectwere to: 1. Identify all the genes in human DNA, of which there are believed to be approximately 20,000–25,000 2. Determine the sequences of the three billion chemical base pairs that make up human DNAProfessor Paul Davies has published an idea that strikes a real chord with thefindings laid out in this book. He does not criticize the people from SETI forconstantly sweeping the skies with radio telescopes, in the hope of stumblingacross a signal from deep space, but he is realistic about the chances ofsuccess. He points out that it is inconceivable that aliens would beam signalsat our planet continuously for untold aeons, merely in the hope that one dayintelligent beings might evolve and decide to turn a radio telescope in theirdirection. And if the aliens only transmit messages sporadically, the chances ofus tuning in at just the right time are infinitesimal.However, he does not write off the idea of contact: ‘But what if the truth isn’tout there at all? What if it lies somewhere else? Now may be the time to try aradically different approach.’43Davies uses the idea we have already reported of a ‘set-and-forget’ technique ofcommunication, whereby the information content of the message may have tosurvive for hundreds of millions of years. He acknowledges that a conventionalartefact placed on the Earth’s surface would be almost certainly overlooked,even if it did somehow survive. He then suggests that an altogether bettersolution would be: ‘…a legion of small, cheap, self-repairing andself-replicating machines that can keep editing and copying information andperpetuate themselves over immense durations in the face of unforeseenenvironmental hazards.’This sounds like pure science fiction but he continues by saying: ‘…Fortunately,such machines already exist. They are called living cells.’What a brilliantly simple idea. We have already established that large sectionsof the scientific community are openly saying that DNA absolutely could not havespontaneously arrived – it must have been designed. So, why would themanufacturer not use it to contain a message?Is it possible? Is there spare space in there for a message?As Paul Davies confirms, the cells in our bodies, and anything else that livesfor that matter, contain messages set out billions of years ago. He also saysthat the idea that aliens have deliberately hidden messages inside DNA has been‘swirling around’ for a few years, and has been championed in recent times bythe Apollo astronaut Rusty Schweickart. But, says Davies, on the face of it,there is a serious problem.Living cells are not completely immune to change, and mutations introduce randomerrors that become stored as information, and, over a long enough time span,they would turn the original message into ‘molecular gobbledygook’. Davies thenreminds us that there is so-called ‘junk’ DNA: sections of the genome that seemto serve no useful purpose. These areas could be loaded with messages withoutaffecting the performance of the cells and some parts of that junk DNA are inhighly conserved regions that are therefore relatively safe from degradation.When a team of genomic researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratoryin California presented their own findings in June 2004, the audience gasped inunison. Those listening, simply could not believe what they were hearing fromEdward Rubin and team who were reporting that they had deleted huge sections ofthe genome of mice without it making any discernable difference to the animals.The result was truly amazing because the deleted sequences included what isknown as ‘conserved regions’, which were previously assumed to have beenprotected because they contained vital information about functions.To find out the function of some of these highly conserved non-protein-codingregions in mammals, Rubin’s team deleted two huge regions of DNA from mice,containing nearly 1,000 highly conserved sequences shared between humans andmice. One of the removed chunks was 1.6 million DNA-bases long and the other wasover 800,000 bases long – which should have caused the mice to have seriousproblems.All DNA can acquire random mutations, but if a mutation occurs in a region thathas a key function, the individual will die before they are able to reproduceand therefore the damage to the information will be removed from the species.This protection mechanism means that the most vital sequences of DNA remainvirtually unchanged – even between species. So by comparing the genomes of miceand men, geneticists had hoped to pick out those with the most importantfunctions by studying the conserved regions.The geneticists were utterly perplexed because the regions they removed made nodifference to the mice in question, so there seemed to be no reason why thesenon-coding sequences, apparently functionless parts of the DNA, should beprotected from change. Why should they matter? It is like having the world’sfinest encrypted security system built into your waste bin.Any burglar who observed that your rubbish had so much apparently unnecessaryprotection would immediately suspect that you were hiding something of greatvalue in an unexpected place. And that is the thought that occurred to PaulDavies. He believes there could be a message from extra terrestrials in what hasbeen referred to as junk DNA.We suspect he might be right about the message but not about the author. Hesays:‘Looking for messages in living cells has the virtue that DNA is being sequencedanyway. All it needs is a computer to search for suspicious-looking patterns.Long strings of the same nucleotides are an obvious attention-grabber. Peculiarnumerical sequences like prime numbers would be a clincher and patterns thatstand out even when partially degraded by mutational noise would make the mostsense… if a sequence of junk DNA bases were displayed as an array of pixels on ascreen (with the colour depending on the base: blue for A, green for G, and soon…’He then asks what the message could contain and notes that one segment of DNA,chopped out by Rubin and his team, contained more than a million base pairs –enough, he says, ‘for a decent-sized novel or a potted history of the rise andfall of an alien civilization.’And this would be from just one part of the junk DNA.As we digested Davies’ suggestion about number sequences making a screen we wereimmediately reminded of how the numbers that we have identified as the lead keyof the message produce 10,000 – or if the decimal point is removed from thevalues we get the following:3663 x 273 = 999,999As close to a million as makes no difference.These are the PIN numbers of the Earth and Moon doubly cross-referenced by theirorbital periods and relative masses. Without the decimal point, they describe ascreen (possibly a computer monitor) that has a million pixels with sides of3663 and 273.One of the ‘high security’ sections of apparently empty genome removed byRubin’s team had just over a million elements. It would be more than interestingto apply the 3663 x 273 matrix to this data."},{"pageContent":"WHAT WILL IT TELL US?It may well give us vital information about building equipment that moves matterbackwards in time and it will tell us where to start the process of planning tobuild a Moon! It is likely that it will also instruct us where to look forfurther information.If we are correct, we are all carrying this ‘treasure map’ in our hearts, ourbrains and even our hair. But so too is every living creature on God’s Earth.‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness,’ said God.Could it really be true that a team of humans will control the creation of ourworld and seed it with DNA so that humans will evolve in our own image? Will afuture president of the United States of America, or perhaps a Director Generalof the United Nations sanction the launch of a mission to create these mammoth,but necessary, changes to the past, whilst quoting the words from verse 26 ofthe first chapter of the Book of Genesis?This is not a blasphemous thought. Some Christians and indeed people of otherreligions might find this idea offensive because it appears to suggest that wehumans are God. But this is not the case. It merely suggests that we acted andwill act on creative information that was originated somewhere else by someelemental force that transcends all Universes – all parallel realities.The awe and mystery of existence remains intact and for those that want to callthat essence ‘God’, He remains unchallenged.However, the account we describe here does sit well with the scriptures of thegreat religions. Genesis is remarkably accurate and, as it turns out, thecreationists may not be entirely wrong about a grand design in which humans wereexistent from the start. They will have to adjust their dating assumptions,which do not come from the Bible anyway. And they will have to accept thatevolution was just a mechanism within the grand design.The Hindu perception of the way the Universe works also remains intact, and theonly adjustment they might adopt would be to accept that the cycle of rebirthhas twisted into reverse as well as going forwards. We doubt the intellectualswithin Buddhism will have a problem with this.We see this process of self-conception as something akin to a Möbius strip,named after August Ferdinand Möbius, the nineteenth- century Germanmathematician and astronomer. Möbius was a pioneer in the field of topology.Along with his contemporaries, Riemann, Lobachevsky and Bolyai, Möbius created anon-Euclidean revolution in geometry.The simple construct that is a Möbius strip can be made with a strip of paper byjoining the ends with a 180° twist. It then only has one surface and one edgethat goes around forever. Without the half- twist it would have been impossibleto move from one side to the other without crossing an edge – but suddenly thebarrier does not exist. If one travelled in a straight line on a Möbius surfaceone would return to the starting point.Figure_13.tif [../Images/00018.jpeg]Figure 13The world’s most famous graphic artist Maurits Cornelis Escher(1898–1972) wasfascinated by the imagery of the Möbius surface.We see an analogy with humankind who evolved from DNA, seeded on Earth some 3.5billion years ago by ourselves, just a little in our future. When we reach thepoint of being able to travel back in time we will have completed a circuit ofthe single-sided loop and then move off into a new trajectory.Once the idea of time travel is accepted as a scientific possibility, there isno problem with the idea that humans in the future engineered both DNA and thelife-nurturing Earth–Moon system billions of years ago. We exist because theright circumstances were present for life to develop – and so why does it matterwhether a super-entity (God), extraterrestrials or humans arranged it to be so?Why should it be wrong to arrange for our own arrival?Each of them is extremely unlikely, but nothing like as unlikely as the notionof random chance – the endless mega-string of beneficial good luck.The idea of the Möbius principle is that it is a loop that twists back in timeand returns forward again. Imagine a situation whereby an artefact (say a blackmonolith) was manufactured in the year 2010 and was taken back in time by fourbillion years in 2011, where it was buried in a location of long-term stabilityon the Moon. The artefact could be recovered from the Moon before it wasmanufactured and the atomic matter from which it was made would exist in twoplaces at the same time, until it was transported back to the early Moon.This seems impossible. But just about everything about quantum physics soundsimplausible. Quantum physics tells us that everything from light to matter ismade up of tiny, indivisible packets called quanta that do not work as wenormally see the world. Niels Bohr, one of the pioneers of the subject said:‘Anyone who can contemplate quantum mechanics without getting dizzy hasn’tproperly understood it.’One of the features of this branch of science is the recognition that particles(or wave functions) briefly exist in several different places simultaneously.The monolith that had two concurrent realities would be a quantum effect on aworldly scale instead of at a sub atomic level.Once the 2010 artefact goes back in time, the duality will be resolved and theworld will continue as normal. Equally, we could consider all of the time, fromthe building of the Moon through to the point of time travel, as a Möbius loopwhere we end up back where we started. Thereafter we break out of the loop andmove forward in the normal way."},{"pageContent":"TIME AND AGAINWe have speculated that chronobots were sent back to engineer the Moon and theymust have returned again nearly a billion years later to seed the ploughed Earthwith DNA, to begin the process of evolution that would result in the arrival ofhumans.But it appears that there must have been other interventions at specific timesin the past to bring about certain events.We have always agreed with archaeologists who say that the existence of theMegalithic Yard is inconsistent with the technology otherwise known to have beenpresent amongst the people of western Europe over five millennia ago. But weheartily disagreed with them when most chose to ignore Professor Thom’s findingsrather than attempt to reconcile them. Such people are obstacles to knowledge.When we discovered that the Megalithic system extended to the Moon, ourcredulity was stretched to the limit but our curiosity carried us forward to tryand make sense of that which looked impossible to reconcile. When we found thatthe metric system had been in place almost perfectly, four-and-a-half thousandyears before a team of French scientists reinvented it, we were amazed. Then wediscovered that metric units were perfect integers for the most crucial aspectsof the Moon as well as the Earth.We have noted that through ancient history different civilizations have recordedthat people with super powers arrived from nowhere to teach humanity about thesciences. Then we noted how all the parallel developments that occurred aroundthe world in unconnected locations happened at the same time.We have to conclude that people will travel back to points in history, such asthe era around 3100 BC, when several civilizations, from South America to NorthAfrica to Asia to Europe, were suddenly emerging and building similarstructures. It seems probable that the Megalithic structures that have lunaralignments, and use the unit that describes the dimensions of the Moon, weredeliberately designed and left to point the way forward.We do not yet know whether the detailed message is indeed inside the protectedsections of DNA, but wherever it is, the initial message was only recognizedbecause of all those Megalithic structures extending their weathered and ancientstone fingers into the night sky.The fact that the imperial pound and the pint are mathematically derivable fromthe Megalithic Yard was puzzling and when we found that the same Stone-Age unitdescribes metric spheres we were dumbfounded. How could such surprisingconsequences come about so accurately by chance alone?It now seems that the past has been modelled by the future. A strange Möbiantwist for reality.Of course this all sounds so improbable that some people will refuse to believeit. They will reject the fact that everything we have put forward is real andtestable and the elements of unavoidable speculation are scientifically sound.But many creationists will still shout that black is white and many so-calledscientists will return to their deeply flawed paradigms as though they werereal.But when the message is actually found.

Alexander Thomwas certainly an unreasonable person, or else he would have capitulated in theface of the wave of rejection he received from the majority of professionalarchaeologists. How irritating of the man, his opponents thought, to repeatedlyinsist that his reams of data, gathered over scores of years, show that theMegalithic builders worked to an incredible degree of engineering accuracy andemployed precise standardized units of length.Any reasonable person, and certainly any academic who wanted future employmentwithin a specific discipline, would have buried the data that showed that theMegalithic Yard and its accompanying geometry were integer to the Moon and Sunas well as the Earth. It sounds ridiculous, and those who are members of the‘club’ will consider anyone who speaks of it equally ridiculous.Yet the Moon unquestionably does conform to Megalithic geometry and now, webelieve, we are beginning to understand why.The SETI institute is still sweeping the skies looking for incomingelectromagnetic radiation that deviates even a tiny amount from the anticipatedbackground noise – something that could conceivably be an indication ofintelligence elsewhere in the cosmos. But the message they seek is already withus because, by the standards of what SETI considers might constitute a message,surely the material we have described here must be the world’s first primecontact with a consciousness that existed 4.6 billion years ago.The assumption of SETI and its operatives is that another intelligence will makecontact from far away and so the searchers are focused on staring into the fardepths of space for a message.

Is it this new leading edge of attention that haspreviously blinded us to the obvious in our own backyard?The message we have received has told us about the way that the Moon wasconstructed to give life to the Earth, and there are tantalizing hints that thisdesign may extend to the rest of the solar system, and possibly even beyond.

Today the sheer enormity of available information hasled to highly defined specialisms, and academics are expected to keep to theirfield – despite the truism that science has no experts. No one, for instance,doubted Alexander Thom’s abilities as a professor of engineering but he was notwelcome in the world of archaeology.The gains from modern science are beyond counting. But the loss, arguably, isthe synthesis of information generated by the many gentleman scholars that onceexisted, before becoming extinct somewhere around the late nineteenth century.So few scholars now have a chance to view the bigger picture – to seek outpatterns that might unexpectedly exist when apparently unrelated data is broughttogether. It has to be remembered that the difference between a majorbreakthrough and nothing at all can be just the angle of view rather thananything else.Occasionally, two or more disciplines are brought together to form a newspeciality in science. One of these turned out to be the subject that wasdirectly invented by Alexander Thom, namely archaeoastronomy – a field of studyinvolved with the use of astronomy by ancient cultures. Our previous book,Civilization One, demonstrated the geometry that lies behind Thom’s proposedMegalithic Yard. We unambiguously showed how it is directly related to othermeasurement systems (linear, volumetric and weight) and put forward a testabletheory of how it was reproduced using Venus and a pendulum. We therefore decidedto send a copy of our book to a man who we believe is the world’s only professorof archaeoastronomy. He received a précis and the completed book but we receivedno response whatsoever.We knew that the information we had put forward was not incorrect because peoplesuitably qualified in astronomy and mathematics had carefully checked it. So whyno response? Perhaps the approach was so counter to the worldview of thisparticular expert he could not understand it. Or maybe he just did not like theimplications of our conclusions.We also attempted to get a copy of the book to a world-class physicist. When hewas told of the subject matter he responded almost angrily by saying that it waswell known that Thom’s work had been discredited decades ago and only weirdosclung onto the romantic hope that Stone-Age man possessed a rational andunchanging unit of length.In actual fact he was repeating a mantra that has sprung up in academic circlesbut is no more than an urban myth, because no one has proven Thom to be wrong.We responded by pointing out that we had done our research very carefully andthat whilst there are certainly people who have argued against Thom’sconclusions, they have not proven his conclusions to be wrong – nor is itpossible for anyone to prove a negative.The academic then responded politely and accepted what we said, although heexplained that he did not have time to read our book due to personal problems.We therefore expect to have a fight on our hands when it comes to gettingleading academics to review the findings contained in this book. But fight wewill.Finally, it is probably helpful to apply to our whole hypothesis a test createdby the late, great astronomer Carl Sagan, that he called a ‘Baloney DetectionKit’. Sagen suggested a set of tools shown below for testing claims anddetecting fallacious or fraudulent arguments. We have put our responses beneathin italics.Wherever possible there must be independent confirmation of the facts.All of the key elements that we consider constitute a message are checkableusing data published by leading authorities.Encourage substantive debate on the evidence by knowledgeable proponents of allpoints of view.Yes please. We have tried and will continue to do so.Arguments from authority carry little weight (in science there are noauthorities).At least it should be a level playing field.Spin more than one hypothesis – don’t simply run with the first idea that caughtyour fancy.We have had to dismiss only one possible hypothesis: coincidence, and haveinvestigated every other avenue we can think of.Try not to get overly attached to a hypothesis just because it’s yours.Quantify, wherever possible.We struggled to accept our own results initially and we remain entirely open toany other interpretation that might be brought forward.If there is a chain of argument every link in the chain must work.Unlike the existing main theories of the Moon’s origin and the origin of DNA, webelieve that we have a very strong chain with no weak link.Occam’s razor – if there are two hypotheses that explain the data equally well,choose the simpler.Absolutely. But the simplest is also the weirdest, although it is also the mostscientifically robust.Ask whether the hypothesis can, at least in principle, be falsified (shown to befalse by some unambiguous test). In other words, is it testable? Can othersduplicate the experiment and get the same result?The number sequences we have found are checkable by anyone with a book on basicastronomy and a calculator. The question is just how far people are prepared togo in claiming coincidence.We believe we have made a case that deserves to be heard and investigated. It ishard to imagine how even the most sceptical, unimaginative academic could denythe possibility that we are looking at a message here. Not to investigate anddiscuss it further would be anti-scientific and, we believe, very foolish.Everyone who has bothered to think about it is agreed; any message from thedistant past either has to be very big or very small. We believe it is both.We have good reason to think that Professor Paul Davies and others who suspectthat there could be a communication addressed to us in apparently empty sectionsof DNA are correct. If the next layer of the message is, as seems likely,contained in the cells of our own bodies – it must be sought out!Our suggestion that the group of a million unused base pairs, found bygeneticist Edward Rubin and his team, might be a viewable message if laid out ona format of 3663 x 273 has to be tested. It might be the answer and, if so,humankind is on the verge of a new age – an age of maturity.But if the message is not detected in that way, the peculiarities of the Moonremain and we need all serious scientists to work together to solve this riddle– which must be almost in our grasp.We call on the world to assemble a team of leading scientists from all of thedisciplines that could possibly be involved in deciphering the Moon’s messageand, if our third scenario is correct, constructing the CTC – the time transportsystem. And we may need observers from the leading religions.We suggest that this be called ‘The Möbius Mission’ – a project to begin allprojects!Albert Einstein was an incredibly wise man as well as a scientific genius.Amongst his many quotable observations he once said: ‘Imagination is moreimportant that knowledge.’How true. We therefore need people with depth of vision as well as knowledge andpractical ability. So, it is our intention to first approach scientists such asPaul Davies, David Deutsch and Ronald Mallett. We feel sure that their curiositywill help to change the world."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX ONEUSING THE MEGALITHIC PENDULUMABOUT PENDULUMSA pendulum is one of the simplest devices imaginable. In its most basic form itis nothing more than a weight suspended on a piece of twine or sinew. Since thependulum has another function, as a plumb line, it may well be one of the firstdevices used by humanity. If allowed to hang, the weight of a pendulum will pullits string into a perfectly vertical position. Certainly the Megalithic peoplecould never have constructed any of the major sites to be found all overBritain, Ireland and Brittany without the use of this device. It is thereforereasonable to suggest that if they possessed a plumb line, they also possessed apendulum.Although the device had been around for a long time it was the sixteenth-centurygenius Galileo who seems to have been the first person to look seriously at theattributes of pendulums (or at least the first of whom we have a record.) He isreported to have been bored in Church one day when his attention was caught by alarge incense burner suspended from above by a chain or a rope, gently swingingback and forth and forming a natural pendulum. Galileo realized that the swingsof the pendulum were equal in terms of time and he counted them against the beatof his own pulse.Only two factors are of importance in the case of a simple pendulum. These arethe length of the string and the gravitation of the Earth, which constantlyexerts a pressure that will eventually bring the pendulum back to a vertical andresting position. The height of the swing of a pendulum is, to all intents andpurposes, irrelevant because its time period from one extremity to the otherwill always be the same. In other words if the pendulum is excited morevigorously it will swing higher but its time period will remain the same.It was a recognition of this constant nature of a pendulum that made it usefulin the creation of clocks. In modern timepieces the pendulum has beensuperseded, but for many centuries it ensured the smooth running of clocks allover the world. It can still be found in quality clocks. Clock pendulums wereeventually fitted with devices to prevent them from swinging too high, andothers to regulate the nature of their arc of swing, but they are still,essentially, only animated plumb lines."},{"pageContent":"THE MEGALITHIC YARDThe Megalithic Yard was discovered by Alexander Thom as part of the compositionof Megalithic sites from the northernmost part of Scotland, right down toBrittany in the South. The main problem with its use, and the reasonarchaeologists still doubt its veracity, lies in the fact that it remainedabsolutely accurate across thousands of square miles and many centuries. Thiswould appear to be impossible in the case of a culture that was, at least in itsearly stages, devoid of metals to make a reliable ‘standard’ against whichothers could be set. Alexander Thom himself could think of no reliable way ofpassing on the Megalithic Yard without some variation being inevitable acrosstime.We eventually reasoned that it would be possible to turn ‘time’ into ‘distance’by way of the turning Earth. The speed of the Earth on its axis is as accurate ayard stick for the passing of time as anyone could reasonably require for mostpurposes. Of course we can’t see the Earth turning but we can see its effects.The Sun, Moon and stars appear to rise from below the horizon in the east, topass over our heads and then set in the west. In fact, although the Moon andplanets do have independent movement, the Sun and the stars are not reallymoving at all (actually they are moving slightly but we need not concernourselves with this for our present purposes).The apparent motion of the stars is caused by the Earth turning on its axis andit is this fact that offers us an accurate clock which, with a little ingenuity,we can turn into a replicable linear unit of measurement. In the case of theMegalithic Yard we eventually discovered that the pendulum upon which it isbased was set not by viewing any star but the planet Venus. Venus is, like theEarth, orbiting the Sun. As a result, when seen from the Earth, it has a complexseries of movements against the backdrop of the stars. Sometimes Venus risesbefore the Sun, at which times it is called a morning star, and at other timesit rises after the Sun and is then known as an evening star. This is purely aline-of-sight situation, caused by the fact that both Venus and the Earth areorbiting the Sun. When Venus crosses the face of the Sun to become an eveningstar, it is moving ‘against’ the direction followed by the backdrop of stars. Itis within this observable fact that setting the Megalithic pendulum becomespossible.In order to create the Megalithic Yard one has to follow the simple rules below:Venus must be observable as an evening star, setting after the Sun and duringthat period at which it is moving at its fastest counter to the backdrop ofstars.The sky is divided into 366 parts. This can be achieved by trial and error, asexplained in Uriel’s Machine44 and also in Civilization One45 but is alsoachievable through a neat little mathematical trick demonstrated below. 1. Stand in an unobstructed position on a wide open piece of ground with a good view of the western horizon. 2. Place a stick in the ground (stick A) and stand facing west with one of your heels touching the stick. 3. Now take 233 steps, heel to toe, towards the west. Upon completing the 233 steps, place a second stick in the ground (stick B) in front of your toe. 4. Turn to the north and place your heel against stick B. Now take four heel-to-toe steps to the north and then place a third stick (stick C) in the ground in front of your toe. 5. The distance between sticks B and C, when viewed from A will now be 1/366th of the horizon.It is now necessary to make a braced wooden frame of the type shown in figures14 and 15, which is as wide as the gap between B and C. This must be set onpoles in such a way that it gains significant height and can be altered in itsangle.The purpose of this exercise is so that the angle of the braced frame can beidentical to that of the planet Venus as it falls towards its setting position.Standing at A it is now necessary to observe Venus passing through the gap inthe braced frame whilst swinging a pendulum and noting the number of swingsachieved as Venus passes through the gap. A pendulum that swings 366 timesduring this occurrence must be 1/2 of a Megalithic Yard in length (41.48cm). Thecord of this length represents the full Megalithic Yard of 82.966cm in length.Figure_14.tif [../Images/00019.gif]Figure 14Figure_15.tif [../Images/00020.jpeg]Figure15In this way the Megalithic Yard can be reproduced on any site where observationof Venus, when at the right part of its cycle, can be achieved. For the use ofthe braced frame we are grateful to the considerations of Professor Archie Roy,Emeritus Professor of Astronomy at Glasgow University.Although pendulums differ slightly with latitude and altitude, because gravityalso alters slightly, we have shown that the Megalithic Yard achieved using thismethod will remain within the tolerances discovered by Alexander Thom fromOrkney in the north to Brittany in the south, in other words across the wholearea containing monuments surveyed by Alexander Thom."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX TWOUSING THE SUMERIAN PENDULUMThe method used by the Sumerians to set their own basic unit of length, thedouble kush, followed the same general rules as those employed by the Megalithicpeoples of the far west of Europe. The only difference lay in the numbers used.Sumerians relied on a 360º geometry, of the type we still use today. Because ofthis their starting point was to divide the horizon into 360 equal units. Themathematical trick used to short-circuit this procedure that was itemised inAppendix One does not apply in this case. It is possible that the Sumeriansdevised their own method of making the initial procedure quicker, but in anycase theirs was a metal-using culture and one that would therefore not haveneeded to repeat the procedure of defining the linear unit all that often. Theycould have created a fairly accurate standard rod. Establishing the necessary1/360th of the horizon by trial and error would have taken time, but it is quitepossible to achieve with a high degree of accuracy.The procedures used in the preceding Appendix are now followed. The braced framewould be equal to a gap of 1/360th of the horizon but Venus would be tracked inexactly the same way. The desired number of swings in this case is 240, which isthe same as 240 seconds, a period of time known to the Sumerians as a ‘gesh’. Apendulum that swung 240 times during the passage of Venus through the bracedframe would be 99.88 cm in length, a linear length that conforms to thatdiscovered on the statues of Gudea from Lagesh in Iraq. This unit of length wasknown to the Sumerians as the double kush.It has to be noted that the pendulum in question is not strictly speaking aseconds pendulum of the sort that was popularly used from the seventeenth to thenineteenth century. Because the object being tracked is Venus, which is movingindependently against the backdrop of stars, the time taken for each beat of thependulum is slightly longer than a second (1.002 seconds). This stands as partof the proof that the Sumerians did use this system to define their linear unit.They fully understood that there were 43,200 seconds in a day (to us there aretwice this number because we use a twenty-four-hour day instead of the Sumeriantwelve-hour day) but there is no absolutely reliable way of defining the truesecond of time by observing the sky and swinging a pendulum. This could only beachieved by tracking the average movement of the Sun in the same way Venus isused in this exercise. However, because of the Earth’s own orbitalcharacteristics, the Sun does appear to move at a constant speed across the sky.There are only a few days each year on which the experiment using the Sun wouldwork perfectly and the Sumerians could not have known which days would have beenappropriate. In addition, the Sun is very much more difficult, and potentiallydangerous, to track in this way.Similarly, if they had used a star instead of the planet Venus, the pendulumwould still not have been a true seconds pendulum. The reason for this is thatthe sidereal day (a day that is measured by a star passing from one point in thesky back to that point again) is shorter than a solar day (a day that ismeasured by the Sun passing from one position in the sky back to that pointagain). A seconds pendulum created by tracking a star would actually give a timereading of 0.997 seconds and lead to a pendulum length close to 99.3cm.We remain convinced that both the Megalithic culture and that of the Sumerianswere simply following instructions that had been given to them by anotheragency. In the case of the Sumerians the use of Venus for setting theirpendulum, and therefore their chosen unit of length, resulted in a series ofmeasurements that were truly integrated with the Earth. As we have shown, theSumerian double mana unit of mass divides into the mass of the Earth6,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times, which would not have been the case witha shorter pendulum and therefore a lighter unit of mass. True, the achievedsecond of time was slightly at odds with the genuine second of time, but theSumerians, lacking accurate clocks, could not have been aware of this fact. Infact the discrepancy is so small it couldn’t have been measured until the lastcentury or so."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX THREETHE MESSAGE IN DETAILThe message that we have detected is present in recurring number sequences thatare, strangely, often round numbers. We started to realize that something highlyunusual was happening when we discovered that the Megalithic system of geometryworked on the Moon and the Sun as well as the Earth.Looking into issues concerning the Moon we were immediately reminded of thestrange coincidence that the Moon and the Sun appear to be the same size inEarth’s skies, leading to the phenomenon we call a total eclipse. Still strangeris the fact that the relation is so numerically neat with the Moon being 400times smaller than the Sun and 400 times closer to the Earth at the point of atotal eclipse. On its own this could be a bizarre coincidence, but because ofwhat follows we believe that it is the ‘headline’ to a message built into theMoon 4.6 billion years ago."},{"pageContent":"THE MEGALITHIC SYSTEMThe Megalithic system of geometry is based on 366° to a circle, sixty minutes toa degree and six seconds to a minute. This sequence produces a second of arc onthe Earth’s polar circumference that is 366 Megalithic Yards long, the linearmeasure of the Megalithic builders as identified by Alexander Thom.As a cross-reference we had also discovered that the 4,000-year-old Minoan Footis precisely equal to a 1,000th part of a Megalithic second of arc.We applied the principles of Megalithic geometry to all of the planets and moonsin the solar system and found that it only produced round integer results forthe Sun and the Moon.The Sun is very close to being a true sphere, certainly much more so than theEarth. NASA quote the mean volumetric circumference as being 4,373,096km, whichwe converted into Megalithic Yards and applied the 366 geometry.Sun’s circumference = 5,270,913,968 MYOne degree = 14,401,404 MYOne minute = 240,023 MYOne second = 40,003.8 MYThe fit is 99.99per cent accurate to 40,000 and given that this is based on abest estimate of the mean circumference it has to be considered bang on.Like the Sun, the Moon is quite close to being a sphere. NASA gives the meanvolumetric circumference of 10,914.5km, which produces the following result:Moon’s circumference = 13155300 MYOne degree = 35943 MYOne minute = 599 MYOne second = 99.83 MYIf we use the equatorial radius the result is 99.9 MY per second of lunar arc.Either way, this is as close to 100 MY as makes no difference, given theirregular surface of the Moon and the small variation in Thom’s definition ofthe Megalithic Yard of +/- 0.061cm.It could have been possible for people many thousands of years ago to create asystem of geometry that produces round integers for two celestial objects suchas the Earth and the Sun, but it would seem impossible to achieve such a featfor three bodies. It therefore appears that the Moon was designed using unitsderived from the physical dimensions of the Sun and the Earth."},{"pageContent":"THE EARTH–MOON RELATIONSHIPThe duration of the Moon’s orbit (sidereal – fixed star to fixed star) is 27.322Earth days (27.396 rotations of the Earth). This number is extraordinarily closeto the size relationship of the Moon to the Earth, being 27.31 per cent of theEarth’s size.The Earth currently turns on its axis 366.259 times for each orbit around theSun. This number is extraordinarily close to the size relationship of the Earthto the Moon, being 366.175per cent larger than the Moon.There is no reason why these numbers should repeat in this way:Earth turns per orbitper cent size of polar circumferenceEarth 366.25927.31Moon 27.396366.175It is also a consequence of the above that the Moon makes 366 orbits of theEarth in 10,000 Earth days.The size of the Sun, Earth and Moon have been fixed for billions of years sotheir size ratios have not changed. But the orbital characteristics of the Earthand the Moon have changed constantly.When the Moon was much closer to the Earth than it is now, its orbit was muchshorter and the Earth day was also shorter, leading to perhaps as much as 600days to the Earth year. The Earth’s own orbit around the Sun remains essentiallyunchanged. It is only the time it takes to spin on its own axis that alters.The close number association between the size ratios of the Sun, Moon and Earth,and the orbital characteristics of the Moon, together with the present length ofthe Earth day, are only applicable to the time that humans have been fullyformed. These relationships were not present in the distant past and they willdisappear in the distant future. The number sequences which alerted us to the‘message’ are clearly meant for the present period."},{"pageContent":"THE METRIC SYSTEMOrbital characteristics and size relationships are physical factors and anycorrelations are real – no matter what units of measurement are employed. No oneknows the origin of the Megalithic system but the origin of the metric system isfully documented. Whilst it did have a near identical precursor in the Sumeriansystem of more than 4,000 years earlier, the metric system is known to have beendeveloped from measuring the polar circumference of the Earth alone.It was designed so that there should be 40,000km in one Earth circumference. Theequator is a little longer than the polar circumference but basically the Earthturns through this distance each day.The Moon turns through an unimpressive sounding 10,920.8 kilometres every27.3217 days. This converts to 400km per Earth day – to an accuracy greater than99.9 per cent. Again this is a factor that only exists in the human period ofexistence.The number 400 is already central to human appreciation of the Moon because itis 400 times closer to us than the Sun, and it is 400 times smaller. The use of400 kilometres per current Earth day could be a message that the architect ofthe Moon knew we would use kilometres and mean solar days.Metric units apart, the Moon is turning at a rate that is almost exactly one percent of the Earth’s rotation. Or to reverse the factor, the Earth is turning 100times as fast as the Moon. All curiously round values!To add to the idea that this is a deliberate piece of metric design, the Moon isalso travelling on its journey around the Earth at a steady rate of onekilometre per second! This speed varies a little as it travels but does not dropbelow 0.964km per second and does not exceed 1.076km per second.And there is something else very special about the kilometre as regards theMoon. To understand it we need to realize that there are 109.2 Earth diametersacross the Sun’s diameter. There are also 109.2 Sun diameters between the Earthand the Sun at its furthest point of orbit.The circumference of the Moon is 109.2 x 100 kilometres.Is that not odd in the extreme?One way of looking at the association between these ratios and numbers can beseen in the diagram in figure 16.There are many factors here that should bear no relationship with each other atall. Taken in isolation, any one of these strange associations might beconsidered to be a coincidence but there comes a time, however, whencoincidences become so frequent that something else must be at work.Figure_16.tif [../Images/00021.jpeg]Figure 16"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX FOURTHE MECHANICS OF ECLIPSESThe awesome sight of a black shadow gradually crossing the face of the Moonstill captivates most people, even though we now live in an age when we not onlyknow what causes the phenomenon but can predict exactly when it is likely tohappen. Early cultures did not know either and must have seriously thought, fora few minutes at least, that the world was coming to an end.Back in the 1960s the astronomer Gerald Hawkins suggested that at least one ofthe functions of the structure at Stonehenge, Salisbury Plain, England, was topredict the occurrence of eclipses. Hawkins had carefully studied the ancientmonument, parts of which date back five thousand years, and subjected his datato a massive number-crunching computer. He came to the conclusion that theAubrey Holes, a series of fifty-six chalk-filled pits around the standing stonesat Stonehenge, represented a sophisticated device for predicting both solar andlunar eclipses.46Clay tablets discovered in what is now Iraq and dating back to the Sumerianperiod, which commenced around 3000 BC, indicate that people in the region weredoing their best to predict eclipses. And there isn’t any doubt at all that theBabylonians who followed the Sumerians were competent at accurately working outwhen the face of the Sun or Moon would darken.The ancient Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, American cultures and many othersocieties worked hard to develop an understanding of rudimentary astronomy forthe purpose of eclipse prediction. This single effort certainly caused humanityto significantly improve its naked-eye astronomy and its understanding ofmathematics. There are good reasons why this should be the case and at the baseof most of them is power. Any would-be ruler, secular or religious, who couldpredict when an eclipse was likely to take place was in a very strong positionto manipulate the situation to his or her own ends.To the average lay person, eclipses seem to be totally haphazard but this is notthe case. However, such is the complicated nature of the interplay of the Earthand the Sun that understanding eclipse patterns is far from easy. Once thepattern is cracked, its secrets could be passed from one ruler to another and awhole society could be alerted to a possible eclipse. The prediction itselfwould have seemed to most people to be the most sophisticated sort of magic andwhen the king or holy man drove away the dark dragon that was trying to swallowthe Sun or causing the Moon to bleed, his power would be ensured for aconsiderable period ahead.What the ancients gradually discovered was that there were very definitepatterns to the occurrence of all eclipses and that they were governed overallby a specific period of time that is known as the ‘saros cycle’. The word saroswas first used by the astronomer Edmond Halley (1656–1742) and is supposed tohave been derived from a Babylonian word. The saros cycle is 6,585.3 days inlength (18 years, 11 days, 8 hours). It represents the coming together of threedistinct patterns. The first of these is the Synodic Month (new Moon to newMoon,) the second is the Draconian Month (node to node [see below forinformation on Moon’s nodes]) and the third is the Anomalistic Month (perigee toperigee [see below for information on Moon’s perigee]).To within about two hours, 223 synodic months, 242 draconian months and 239anomalistic months come out to the same period of time and it is at this pointthat any eclipse will repeat itself. The reason for this is that the solarsystem runs pretty much like a gearbox and, as with a gearbox, any patterncreated now will sooner or later be repeated.Although the saros cycle is very accurate, there are many such cycles running atthe same time. All that can be deduced from the saros cycle is that if aneclipse occurs today, it will occur again in 6,585.3 days and will have a quitesimilar geometry. The system does fall down somewhat in that it splits a day andso future eclipses in any given cycle may not be fully visible from the samepart of the globe. Each saros cycle runs for around 1,200 years (aroundsixty-six repeat eclipses) until it expends itself. If the saros cycle commencesnear the South Pole it will extend itself gradually further north with eacheclipse until it finally disappears at the North Pole. The same is true inreverse.It would appear that the Babylonians understood the saros cycle, as did theAncient Greeks. So, according to Gerald Hawkins, did the builders of Stonehenge.Something akin to the saros cycle would have been useful to ancient peoplesbecause if the next eclipse in any given series was less impressive than thelast, it would still have been predicted, and it was just as likely to be moreimpressive as less so. (Better by far to turn the tribes out for aless-than-spectacular display than to miss what could be a super show!)Our own previous research demonstrates that following the saros cycle wasactually very easy for the Megalithic people, who were the builders ofStonehenge and thousands of other such monuments. The ritual year of theMegalithic cultures was 366 days in length. This meant that the saros cycle tothem was just two days short of eighteen years in length. The two days didn’treally matter because solar eclipses can only occur at the new Moon and lunareclipses at the full Moon. In other words, just a couple of days short ofeighteen years after a particular eclipse, the next full or new Moon would becertain to bring another.Even today we don’t take solar eclipses for granted. A major eclipse, such asthe one that was visible in northern Europe on August 11th 1999 is treated as atime of celebration and is now revered for its sheer beauty, rather than beingfeared as was surely the case even not so long ago. The face of the Sungradually begins to blacken as the Moon passes between it and the Earth. If itis a full eclipse the Sun’s disc will be covered at what is known as totality.At totality, all that is perceptible is the faint glow from the corona of theSun. Soon after, the shadow begins to move away and a spectacular shaft of lightbreaks out, forming what is known as the diamond ring effect. The phenomenon isjust as impressive now as it must have looked from Babylon or Stonehenge.It might surprise readers to learn that no matter where our astronauts orcosmonauts travel in the future within our solar system, they will never standon the surface of any other planet and watch a total eclipse. They are simplynot possible anywhere else and only occur as a legacy of a series ofbreathtaking, apparent coincidences. The fit of the Moon’s disc across the faceof the Sun during a total eclipse is not ‘near’ – it is ‘exact ’– and this factshould be the greatest sense of wonder to anyone viewing such an event becauseit is very unlikely. No other planet has a moon anywhere near big enough ororbiting at the right distance to fully, but not too fully, eclipse the Sun.There are two basic sorts of eclipse, and then subcategories within the twotypes. The most impressive form of eclipse is known as a solar eclipse. Thedrawing below shows what is actually happening when a solar eclipse takes place.Figure_17.tif [../Images/00022.jpeg]Figure 17When the Moon stands directly between the Earth and the Sun, a total eclipse ispossible but totality only occurs across a relatively small area of the Earth’ssurface and follows a curve known as the Path of Totality.In this example, which is a ‘total eclipse’, to a proportion of those peopleliving along the path of totality, the disc of the Sun will be blotted outcompletely. Whilst totality is achieved, all that can be seen is the sun’scorona (the halo of bright matter that is constantly being thrown off by theSun). The larger shadow is called the penumbra and people beneath this will seea partial eclipse. There is another form of solar eclipse that can never betotal and this is known as an annular eclipse. The Moon is 1/400th part the sizeof the Sun and it stands at 1/400th the distance between the Earth and the Sun,but not always exactly.The Moon’s orbit around the Earth is not circular but elliptical. This meansthat sometimes the Moon is slightly closer to the Earth than it is at othertimes. If a solar eclipse takes place when the Moon is furthest from the Earth,the Moon’s disc looks smaller and can never totally blot out the Sun. Totaleclipses of the Sun therefore happen when the Moon is on the part of its orbitthat brings it closest to the Earth. When the Moon is closest to Earth it issaid to be at perigee and when it is furthest away it is at apogee.Solar eclipses can only take place when the Moon stands between the Earth andthe Sun and this is the short period on each lunar cycle known as ‘new Moon’.(The time of the lunar month when no part of the Moon is visible from Earth.)It might be thought that because there is a new Moon each month, there shouldtherefore be a solar eclipse each month but this is not the case. The orbit ofthe Moon around the Earth does not follow the same angle as the orbit of theEarth around the Sun. If it did, every new Moon would indeed bring a solareclipse. Rather it is tilted to the Earth’s orbit (known as the ecliptic) byfive degrees. Only when new Moon occurs at a point when the orbit of the Moonaround the Earth crosses that of the Earth around the Sun, can a solar eclipsetake place. These points north and south of the ecliptic are called the Moon’snodes. This happens ‘at least’ twice each year and can produce a solar eclipseobservable from somewhere on the Earth.The second type of eclipse is not quite so impressive as a solar eclipse but itwould have been fascinating to our ancient ancestors all the same. It is morecommon than a solar eclipse and is known as a lunar eclipse. A lunar eclipsetakes place when the shadow of the Earth comes between the Sun and the Moon. Alunar eclipse can only take place at the exact opposite time to a solar eclipse,at the time of the full Moon when the entire disc of the Moon is visible fromEarth.During a lunar eclipse the face of the Moon does not disappear altogether.Rather it is darkened and, under some circumstances, it appears to turn a deepred. Such lunar eclipses were seen by many ancient cultures as terribleharbingers of disaster and were probably feared as much as solar eclipses.Figure_18.tif [../Images/00023.jpeg]Figure 18The path taken by the Earth around the Sun is not the same as that taken by theMoon around the Earth. There is a 5° difference. Because of this, total eclipsescan only happen when new Moons fall on what is known as the node – that point atwhich the two orbits cross.Figure_19.tif [../Images/00024.jpeg]Figure 19A lunar eclipse takes place when the Earth’s shadow crosses the face of the Moonat the time of full Moon. Once again the fact that the plane of the Earth’sorbit around the Sun and that of the Moon around the Earth are not the sameprevents every full Moon from being eclipsed.Until we did some in-depth research we never realized just how unlikely orextraordinary a total eclipse actually was. It’s all a matter of ‘line of sight’as the diagrams below should make clear. Isaac Asimov, the famed science-fictionguru, described this perfect visual alignment as being: ‘The most unlikelycoincidence imaginable’.Figure_20.tif [../Images/00025.jpeg]Figure 20In this example the eye on the right looks past a small sphere to a much largersphere. The size of the spheres and the distance between them is such thatbecause of the perspective to the viewer the small sphere will exactly cover thelarge sphere.Figure_21.tif [../Images/00026.jpeg]Figure 21Now the small sphere is even smaller, but is at the same distance from the eyeof the observer. Under these circumstances the eye will also see part of thelarger sphere. Finally, if we keep the spheres the same as in the last example,but move the smaller one nearer to the eye of the observer we once again createa situation in which the small sphere appears to exactly cover the large one.Figure_22.tif [../Images/00027.jpeg]Figure 22The sphere of the Sun is almost exactly 400 times larger than that of the Moon.This in itself might be considered nothing more than a strange but meaninglesscoincidence but we must stretch coincidence almost to breaking point when werealize that when the Moon is as close to the Earth as its orbit will bring it,it stands at 1/400th the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Under thesecircumstances when it stands precisely between the observer and the Sun, theMoon ‘must’ exactly cover the disc of the Sun – it is a simple matter ofperspective.In the case of total eclipses we really are living in a tiny snapshot of thehistory of the Earth and the Moon. The Moon was very much closer to Earth at thebeginning of the relationship, and by the time the two reach a situation ofperfect stasis the Moon will be 1.6 times further away from the Earth than itpresently is. If we estimate the Moon to be 4 billion years in age and thenaccept the most common assessment that it will reach its furthest position fromthe Earth in 15 billion years (excluding the fact that the Sun will mostcertainly have gobbled up both Earth and Moon by then) the sum total of theMoon’s journey from closest to furthest from the Earth is 19 billion years. TheMoon is a finite size, as to all intents and purposes is the Sun. There can onlybe a very short window of opportunity during which the disc of the Moon cancover that of the Sun, as seen from Earth, in the truly perfect way that it doesright now. That it has done so just at the time we have evolved into asophisticated enough species to recognize and study the fact seems almostincredible. It doesn’t matter how much experts say ‘It’s just one of thosethings’, it is still an example of one of the most unlikely coincidencesimaginable.It stands to reason that if the Moon were any larger or smaller than it is,total solar eclipses would not be possible at this time. A smaller Moon wouldhave brought such phenomena in the very distant past, when the Moon was muchcloser to the Earth than it is now.This brings us to a discussion of the dimensions of the Moon. In comparison withthe size of its host planet the Moon is huge. Its circumference would only fitinto that of the Earth 3.66 times. Another of the terrestrial type planets,Mars, has two moons, but they are tiny when set against Earth’s Moon, which interms of size might reasonably be termed a planetoid. Even bearing in mind thevast size of the planetary super-giants, with their proliferation of moons,Earth’s Moon is still the fifth largest in the whole solar system.A close examination of Moon rock, brought back by both American astronauts andSoviet unmanned missions, shows that they are very similar to specific rocks onthe Earth. Analysis of the rocks proves that they were created at the samedistance from the Sun, so there is no longer any real doubt that the Earth andthe Moon have a common origin. Yet there is something very strange about theMoon that isn’t easy to explain. Although it is 1/3rd as big as the Earth it hasonly 1/81st of the Earth’s mass.Had the Moon been composed of a representative sample of ‘all’ Earth’s rocks andstill been the size it is, it would have been much more massive. Conversely, ifthe Moon had exactly the same composition as the Earth and had exerted thegravitational pull it presently does, it would have been very much smaller insize.These facts are discussed in greater detail elsewhere, but it is the weirdcomposition of the Moon, which is comprised of very light, Earth-type rocks,that means it can be large enough to create a total solar eclipse and yet notrip the surface of the Earth to pieces with its gravitational pull every time itpasses overhead.In a Universe filled with incredible wonders, and one so big that it might aswell be infinite as far as we are concerned, we are certain to stumble acrosswhat looks to us like outrageous coincidences. Even conservative astronomersadmit that total eclipses are very unlikely but still maintain such happeningsmust be a random chance event. We beg to differ!"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX FIVETHE WORLD FROM A BARLEY SEEDThe previous work we had undertaken for our book Civilization One had featured anumber of ancient measuring systems. None of these surprised us more than thatcreated by the Sumerians, a culture that originated in what is presently knownas Iraq at about the same time as the Megalithic culture was flourishing inBritain and France. Our ongoing work for the present book made us look again atsome aspects of the Sumerian measuring system. It could be that yet another partof the message left to us, indicating a deliberate intervention into the originand progress of humanity, is encapsulated within the methods the Sumerians usedto measure their world.Out of a plethora of different linear lengths, weights and measures, it waspossible for us to reconstruct the entire Sumerian system as we are sure it wasoriginally meant to be. We have demonstrated how the Sumerians used a pendulumand the planet Venus in order to establish the basic unit of linear length,which was known as the double kush. Existent statues of the Sumerian King Gudeademonstrate that the double kush was intended to measure 99.88cm. Units ofvolume and weight were derived from the double kush by creating a cube withsides of 1/10th of a double kush. The amount of pure water held by such a cuberepresented the sila, which was the Sumerian unit for measuring volume. Theweight of this water was known as the mana or mina and was the Sumerian unit formeasuring mass. How we untangled all of this from the Sumerian records isexplained in detail in our book Civilization One.47There seemed to be no doubt that the double kush had indeed been created by wayof a pendulum and observations of the planet Venus but it was not the only waythe Sumerian system could be recreated. Everything in the system also relied onthe size, shape and weight of a humble barley seed.To the Sumerians a barley seed was known as a se. Until our own investigations,many experts had believed that the use of the barley seed by the Sumerians formeasuring purposes was probably an abstraction. It was generally considered thatthe Sumerians might originally have used such seeds (as was the case in ancientwestern Europe), but that as in the case of Europe the seeds ultimately came tobe words representing sizes and weights that no longer related to barley seedsat all.The Sumerians claimed that 360 barley seeds was the measure of the double kush,something that experts on the Sumerian culture actively deny or at best havetotally ignored.Our extensive investigations showed conclusively why this state of affairs hadcome about. Experts had undoubtedly assumed that if the Sumerians had usedbarley seeds as tiny units of length, they must have laid the seeds end to end.It is likely to be for this reason that it is now generally considered that theseeds themselves eventually lost all contact with units of measure, because whenthey are laid end to end they make no sense at all. However, we discovered thatif the seeds were laid on their sides and front to back (as they may have beencarefully strung on a necklace) they conformed absolutely to the Sumeriansystem.We then went on to demonstrate, by practical experiment, that the Sumerians hadalso been quite correct in their estimation of the ‘weight’ of an average barleyseed and we were staggered to discover that even modern barley seeds have almostexactly the same dimensions and weight as their Sumerian counterparts.It has been possible to show that in terms of mass measurement the wholeSumerian system was irrevocably and seemingly quite deliberately tied to theoverall mass of the Earth itself. We appreciate that this sounds absolutelyabsurd for such an early culture but when one sees the figures involved, thereis no doubt about it.According to Sumerian texts it was considered that there were 10,800 barleyseeds to the unit of weight known as the ‘mana’. The weight of water held in thedouble mana, assuming a double kush of 99.88cm and a cube with sides of 1/10thof this, would have been 996.4 grams.The mass of the Earth is held to be 5.976 x 1024 kg. If we divide this by .9964in order to establish how many double mana there are to the mass of the Earth,we arrive at 5.99759 x 1024 double mana. This number is so close to 6 x 1024(99.99per cent) that this must surely have been the number intended. Since thereare 10.800 barley seeds to the mana and therefore 21,600 to the double mana itis possible to show that the mass of the Earth is equal to that of 1.296 x 1029barley seeds. This might not seem to be a particularly impressive number but ithas some very important properties.If we were to segment the Earth, as we might an orange, we would discover thateach 1/360th segment of the Earth has a mass equal to 3.6 x 1026 barley seeds. Afurther split of sixty brings us to 6 x 1024 barley seeds and yet another splitof sixty results in 1 x 1023 barley seeds, which can be expressed fully as100,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000.The starting point of this exercise was an Earth mass of 6 x 1024 double manafor the mass of the Earth, which would have been highly significant in Sumerianterms since there’s was a sexagesimal (sixty base) system.For all the reasons explained in Civilization One, we cannot accept that thisstate of affairs is a coincidence. What we have with the Sumerian system is afully integrated way of measuring length, volume, mass, area and time, using thesame number bases in each case. The whole system can be constructed from apendulum set by the movements of Venus across one degree of arc of the horizonor else from the bottom up with nothing more complicated than barley seeds.The real question has to be whether or not the Sumerians themselves could havepossibly known just how incredible their measuring systems were? We are leftwith the impression that the system would have been very useful in themarketplace and on the farm in order to ensure equity of measurement throughoutSumerian society but that it is highly unlikely that the Sumerian Priests couldhave known the dimensions of the Earth, let alone its mass. It is most likelythat both concepts would have been absolutely alien to them.This appears to be yet another example of direct and deliberate interventioninto the development of humanity. In other words, as their own mythologydemonstrates, someone ‘taught’ the Sumerians about weights and measures and toldthem the numbers to use. By so doing they supplied the Sumerians with one of thehallmarks of true civilization, namely an integrated and replicable measuringsystem. At the same time, the use of the barley seeds added to a significantseries of messages about these events in prehistory that were intended for ourconsumption. Since it seems unlikely that a cereal grain as widespread anduseful as barley could, by chance, behave in the way that it does in terms ofits size and weight, it seems very likely to us that the crop was geneticallyengineered. It was used by the Sumerians for bread but also brewed into a beerthat was drunk for many centuries across the whole of civilization."},{"pageContent":"NOTES 1. Fox News: June 18th 2004 2.
