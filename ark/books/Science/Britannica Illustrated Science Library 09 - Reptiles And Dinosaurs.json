Here you will find clear, precise information about the appearance and behavior of reptiles, including dinosaurs—a group of reptiles that dominated the globe for millions of years. This fascinating book, which features specially prepared illustrations and images, will reveal details about these creatures as if they were alive on these pages. D id you know that reptiles were the first vertebrates to become totally independent of aquatic environments? This was made possible by the emergence of the amniotic egg. Its shell and membranes enabled reptilian young to develop on land without the need to return to water. Today there are about 8,200 classified species of reptiles in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. These species include turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodiles, and tuataras. Clues about the lives of many of these animals can be found by examining their feet. Different species use their feet to scale walls, climb slender stalks, or run across loose, hot sand dunes. Some reptiles live underground, while others prefer the surface. Since their body temperature is variable, reptiles tend to spend many hours in the sun exposed to direct solar rays and infrared radiation released from heated surfaces. W ith their long, narrow bodies, snakes are different from all other reptiles because they have long spines with many vertebrae. Although they cannot hear in the way mammals do, they can detect low-frequency vibrations in the soil that reveal the presence of predators or prey. Most snakes are carnivorous and can eat objects larger NAGA RASSA MASK This mask is used during popular festivals in Sri Lanka to frighten evil spirits. In Asian cultures, nagas represent sacred serpents. than their own bodies. Stealthy, undulating crawling, sudden color changes, and oversized jaws are other identifying characteristics of reptiles— amazing animals with extraordinary traits that have enabled them to survive for millions of years. E ach page of this book will help you to become familiar with these creatures that are so different from humans. Some of them give birth to completely developed young. They are not born fragile and immature, dependent on their parents to feed and take care of them, as most mammals are. Reptile species also vary widely in the types of scales they have. Their scales may have defensive knobs and spines, as is the case with the tails of some lizards, or they may form crests along their necks, backs, or tails. A lthough snakes are some of the most commonly feared animals, only one out of ten is dangerous. Few people know that snakes are timid creatures that prefer to stay hidden. Most snakes will never attack unless they feel threatened and use warning mechanisms and behaviors before attacking. Unfortunately, others are poisonous—so most snakes are hated and persecuted. The process of learning more about them and learning to identify the really dangerous ones may help us to keep them from disappearing. Many reptile species today are in danger of extinction because of indiscriminate hunting and habitat destruction. Not only ecologists but all people must be concerned about their welfare, helping to ensure that they continue to be part of life on Earth. B ecause of their frightening appearances, snakes, dragons, and crocodiles are found in the legends and myths of peoples throughout the world. In sculptures, paintings, and masks used for various ceremonies, many of these animals are represented as good or bad gods or are associated with magical powers. The snake is usually linked to the primordial waters from which life was created. In Asia, it is said that nagas (sacred serpents) are descended from Kasyapa, the father of all life. Consequently, it is common during popular festivals for both men and women to dance disguised with masks that represent these animals in order to frighten away evil spirits and seek protection. Certain Papuan peoples believe that crocodiles have special powers, and in Europe, mythical winged dragons that breathe fire are viewed as the guardians of treasures. Throughout history, these animals have been both feared and respected, objects of fascination and passion.

At the elbows and knees, the legs are bent at right angles. This arrangement is called extended posture. CROCODILES These animals have semi-extended posture. The limbs project out and down.

Both the elbows and the knees are beneath the body. D inosaurs dominated the Earth for 170 million years, from the late Triassic to the late Cretaceous periods, when the supercontinents of Laurasia and Gondwana were splitting into the landmasses of today. The mass extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 million years ago left fossil remains, including footprints, eggs, and bones. Finding these fossils has enabled scientists to study and classify dinosaurs and to learn about their posture, size, diet, and many other aspects of their lives. These studies revealed that this prehistoric group of lizards included herbivores and carnivores of extraordinary size and striking shapes. REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 9 DEINOS SAURO Lizard Terrible IDENTITY The term Dinosauria was proposed for these extinct reptiles by paleontologist Richard Owen in 1842. The name of each species is based on characteristics of its shape and physiology, the name of its discoverer, or the location where it was found. Legs Depending on their lifestyle, some dinosaurs walked on two legs, and some walked on four. However, they all had a similar posture. Due to the structure of their legs, they bear little resemblance to their relatives today: lizards, tuataras, turtles, snakes, and crocodiles. Marsh vs. Cope The American paleontologists Othniel C. Marsh and Edward D. Cope faced off in a very peculiar struggle. They competed to determine who could find more dinosaur bones and species. The competition was plagued with corruption, mutual accusations of espionage, fraud, theft, and even personal violence. Marsh considered himself the winner of “Bone Wars,” but the field of paleontology was the real winner as roughly 130 species were identified between the two rivals. 1 2 3 TRIASSIC PERIOD 251-199.6 MILLION YEARS AGO JURASSIC PERIOD 199.6-145.5 MILLION YEARS AGO CRETACEOUS PERIOD 145.5-65.5 MILLION YEARS AGO GOLDEN YEARS From the primitive dinosaurs of the Triassic Period, evolutionary lines of carnivores and herbivores diverged.

Lizard Hip Pelvic structure of saurischian dinosaurs Flexible Neck Moved more easily because the vertebrae were light in weight SIR DINOSAUR Sir Richard Owen, a British paleontologist, was the first to identify fossil remains of “terrible lizards,” or “monstrous lizards.” He proposed the term Dinosauria, based on his studies and discoveries, and made the first reconstruction of a fossil for the great London Exhibition of 1851. SPECIES OF DINOSAURS HAVE BEEN CATALOGED AT PRESENT. Over 2,000 Saurischians These dinosaurs had hip bones similar to those of today's reptiles, such as crocodiles and lizards. Many species of saurischian dinosaurs have been found, including Velociraptor and Argentinosaurus . They had long, flexible necks and large claws on the initial digits. Ornithischians Herbivores with hip bones structured like those of birds. The pubis slants backward, parallel to the ischium. Some of the most famous ornithischians were Triceratops and Parasaurolophus . Some ornithischians were protected from head to tail by bony plates. ESTIMATED WEIGHT OF AN ARGENTINOSAURUS 110 tons (100 metric tons)"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"10 DINOSAURS The Triassic Period T he biological crisis of the late Permian Period was followed by a slow resurgence of life in the Triassic Period. The Mesozoic Era has commonly been called the “Age of Reptiles,” and its most famous members are the dinosaurs. In the earliest part of the period, the first representatives of today's amphibians appeared, and toward the end of the period the first mammals emerged. In the middle to late Triassic Period, the many families of ferns and conifers appeared that continue to exist today, as well as other groups of plants that are now extinct. REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 11 PANGEA A New World After the extinction of nearly 95 percent of all life at the end of the Permian Period, the Earth was a dry place with hot deserts and rocky areas. Only the coasts had enough moisture for plants to grow. There was only one continent, called Pangea, which was surrounded by a single ocean, Panthalassa. This supercontinent was the home of dinosaurs and other animals. Pangea was mostly a dry, hot desert with palm trees, ginkgoes, and other gymnosperms. Some small species of horsetail rushes (genus Equisetum ), ferns, and marine algae also survived there. Flora In addition to land reptiles, such as the crocodile, and the most primitive dinosaurs, such as Eoraptor , the first mammals appeared during this period. Fauna MILLION YEARS AGO The Earth had only one continental mass, called Pangea. This continent had an upper region called Laurasia and a lower region called Gondwana. The two areas were partly separated by the Tethys Sea, which later almost completely disappeared. THE TRIAS were named in 1834 by German paleontologist Friedrich August von Alberti, who in doing so grouped the three rock formations that defined this period. GREENHOUSE EFFECT A rapid, extreme global warming event is one of several possible causes of the great extinction of the late Permian Period. It could have created the hot, dry climate that prevailed during the Triassic Period. FIRST COUSINS In addition to the dinosaurs, the pterosaurs—winged dinosaurs—and Lagosuchus lived during the Triassic Period. Together these three types of animals make up the Ornithodira group, though this is often debated today. 250 TO 203 EXTINCTION Toward the end of this period, a new extinction event removed several groups of species while opening up new horizons for those that survived—especially the dinosaurs, which spread rapidly. NUMEROUS SPECIES Reptiles and mammals flourished alongside the dinosaurs. VEGETATION Giant conifers were among the trees that lived on Pangea."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"12 DINOSAURS REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 13 The “Age of Reptiles” T he first period of the Mesozoic Era gave rise to the “Age of Reptiles.” On land, the synapsids, which later developed into mammals, began to decline, and the archosaurs, or “dominant reptiles,” lived in various habitats. The earliest crocodiles began to develop, along with turtles and frogs, among others. The pterosaurs ruled the air and the ichthyosaurs the water. The dinosaurs—another order of archosaurs—appeared in the Middle Triassic, approximately 250 million years ago. Toward the end of the Triassic Period, many other reptiles declined dramatically, and the dinosaurs began their reign. Eoraptor Eoraptor fossils were discovered in 1991 in northwestern Argentina. This small carnivore lived 228 million years ago and measured up to 40 inches (1 m) long. It had sharp teeth and agile hind legs for running and chasing its prey. It may also have eaten carrion. Mussaurus The only known fossils of this species were found alongside eggshells. They were no more than 8 inches (20 cm) long. Their adult size is unknown, but it is estimated to have been as much as 6.5 to 8 feet (2-2.5 m). They are known to have been herbivores. The First Dinosaurs The most primitive dinosaurs were very small in comparison to their relatives of later epochs. Most of them have been found in South America. They were carnivores. Some were scavengers, and others were highly agile hunters. They shared very primitive morphological structures with other reptiles of their group, the archosaurs. Mixed with these primitive structures, however, were advanced bone forms similar to those of the predators that would dominate the Cretaceous Period. These predators were known as the theropods. Throughout the Triassic Period, the early dinosaurs were an uncommon subgroup of reptiles. Toward the end of the Triassic Period, the first large herbivores appeared. Coelophysis Herrerasaurus Mussaurus Eoraptor Coelophysis This skilled carnivore could grow up to 9.2 feet (2.8 m) long. Two types of fossils have been found. They are believed to be males and females, respectively. Fossils of this biped hunter have been found in the United States in several southwestern states. Herrerasaurus is one of the most ancient dinosaurs. It is considered a key to understanding the path dinosaurs took to dominate the following 160 million years. The first fossils were found in the early 1960s in the Ischigualasto valley in northern Argentina by an official paleontological commission headed by Osvaldo Reig. He named the dinosaur in honor of the local guide who found it. Since then several complete skeletons have been found. FRONT LIMBS The relative size of its front limbs suggests that this animal mainly walked on two feet. Each hand had three long claws and two short ones. Its hands were able to grasp with the help of “thumbs” slightly opposed to the other claws. Its hand was a formidable weapon for attacking and holding prey, an earlier form of the hands of other theropods. MOUTH Its tubelike teeth were more curved than those of other carnivores that followed, but they were sharp and serrated like those of its theropod relatives. HIND LEGS On its lower limbs, this dinosaur's toe bones show a high degree of superposition. The toe bones of the first digit, although well developed, are very short and lightweight compared to the second, third, and fourth toes. These long, strong feet enabled Herrerasaurus to run while bearing the great weight of its body. A TRUE CARNIVORE One of the traits that defined this animal as a dinosaur was its typical theropodian head. Its narrow skull had nasal cavities in the front part of its snout, and its eye sockets were part of a hollow bony structure, making its skull both lightweight and strong. TAIL Most predators used their tails to keep their balance while chasing their prey. SPINAL COLUMN The central vertebrae are high and short, and the neural arches have square-shaped projections that are thicker toward the back. There are only two sacral vertebrae. PELVIS Herrerasaurus was a very early saurischian with a primitive sacrum, ilium, and hind legs but a highly developed pubic bone and vertebrae. These traits show that this dinosaur had unique characteristics in its spinal column.

LIMBS FOR HUNTING Like its head, this dinosaur's limbs had the same proportions as the later giant predators of the Cretaceous Period. Its small front limbs were designed for capturing prey. An adult Herrerasaurus weighed between 220 and 880 pounds (100-400 kg). 220 pounds (100 kg) Thumbs I II III IV V"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"14 DINOSAURS REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 15 The First Giant Her b ivore T his primitive saurischian was among the first to usher in the age of the dinosaurs in the late Triassic Period, about 210 million years ago. Dinosaurs had already been in existence for some time, but they were smaller predators thus far. The saurischian was clearly one of the first that fed exclusively on plants and that reached the immense sizes typical of herbivores. Many fossils have been found in over 50 separate locations. The secret of this dinosaur's survival is believed to have been the lack of competition for food, since no other herbivore of the time grew as large. Its name, which means “lizard-hipped,” was given to it in 1837 by the German naturalist Hermann von Meyer. WHERE IT LIVED Its fossils were found in semiarid areas of what are now Germany, France, and Switzerland. At the time, those areas were part of the supercontinent Pangea. WEIGHT- BEARING TOES PLATEOSAURUS Plateosaurus engelhardti Size 26-33 feet (8-10 m) Diet Herbivorous Habitat Semiarid Regions Epoch Late Triassic Range Europe Movement It moved about on its four muscular legs, but it could probably stand up on its hind legs and run quickly. In the Treetops Its long neck helped it to reach the tops of trees. Its mouth had pouches for storing food while it chewed. Head Its brain was small in proportion to the weight of its body, so it is not believed to have been very intelligent. Plateosaurus engelhardti These prosauropods, of the suborder Sauropodomorpha, were among the primitive herbivorous dinosaurs that were forerunners of the giant sauropods of the Jurassic Period. However, they were not actually ancestors of these animals. It is known that they associated with others of their own species because, in many areas, several specimens have been found together. Because of the hot, dry conditions that prevailed where they lived, it seems that they migrated constantly in search of food, which consisted of conifers and palm trees. SEXUAL DIMORPHISM It is thought that Plateosaurus varied in size according to its environment. There is also evidence that males and females had different shapes. Defensive Claw This animal had few defensive resources. However, one of the toes of its front feet had a powerful claw that it used to cut branches and for self- defense. In reality, however, its best defense was to run. MATING Plateosaurs were polyandrous, meaning that the dominant matriarch had from three to five male mates, who competed for her attention during mating season. The eggs, of various sizes, were cared for by each respective male. Claw Upper Limb Hind Foot EVENTUAL BIPEDS Its powerful hips supported the entire weight of its body when it stood up on its hind legs to reach food in the high branches of trees."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"16 DINOSAURS The Jurassic Period D uring this period, dinosaurs diversified greatly and spread out to occupy land, sea, and air. Along with large herbivores, there were salamanders, lizards, and the Archaeopteryx , the most ancient bird known. The climate of the Jurassic Period was mild, with moisture-laden winds from the ocean. They brought great downpours, enabling forests to cover wide areas of land. REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 17 GONDWANA LAURASIA COAL Abundant coal beds dating back to this period proved good indications of the high humidity and abundant vegetation of the time. Because of increasing rains, plant life became lush and exuberant. Mosses grew in the seas and on land. Many species of conifers, horsetail rushes, and ferns formed dense forests. Flora The Green Planet As Pangea split apart, the sea level rose, and large areas of land were flooded. This process increased humidity levels, which led to intense rainfall and created a milder climate. These climate conditions helped create rich forest ecosystems. Afforded abundant food, animal populations skyrocketed. The splitting of the continent also caused volcanic eruptions. Despite the dramatic movements of tectonic plates, the climate was warm and temperate on most areas of the planet. A NEW OCEAN The Tethys Sea expanded from east to west, separating Laurasia and Gondwana. The Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean began to form. MILLION YEARS AGO The Earth began to divide. During the Jurassic Period, North America drifted north and separated from what is now South America. North America formed part of Laurasia with what would become Europe. Antarctica, South America, India, and Australia formed Gondwana to the south. 208 TO 140 Dinosaurs greatly diversified and increased their geographic distribution during this period. Herbivorous saurischians, such as Brachiosaurus , and carnivores, such as Allosaurus , predominated. Ornithischians, such as Stegosaurus , also multiplied during this time. Fauna STUDIES IN JURA The name “Jurassic” comes from the Jura mountain range in the northern Swiss Alps. This is where the formal mapping of the rocks of this period took place. PLANT LIFE GROWS Trees began to cover regions that had once been deserts. ORNITHISCHIANS These dinosaurs were numerous on the continents. SHARED WORLD During this period, the first marsupials appeared. Today highly developed versions of these mammals exist in Australia, which split apart from the rest of Gondwana in the late Jurassic. The Jurassic was also the age of Archaeopteryx , the most ancient of the primitive birds."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"18 DINOSAURS REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 19 Different Species D uring the middle of the Jurassic Period, the planet was lush and green. The gradual splitting of Pangea created new ecological environments, which were more humid and more diverse. The increased humidity enabled the growth of large trees and dense vegetation. This flourishing environment powered the continued diversification of different dinosaur species. In contrast, these conditions forced a decline in the majority of synapsids, and the archosaurs —the group that includes crocodiles— largely disappeared. Other species also found their ecological niches and multiplied. These species included sea creatures, such as sharks and rays, that resemble their modern relatives, as well as ray- finned fish with sharp teeth, such as the fierce predator Aspidorhynchus. Dryosaurus The fossils of this ornithopod, of the suborder Ornithischia, were found in Tanzania and the United States at the same time during the 19th century, in the middle of the so- called “Bone Wars.” This lightweight herbivore could reach up to 14.8 feet (4.5 m) long and weigh nearly 200 pounds (90 kg). Camarasaurus This large, herbivorous sauropod lived on the plains of North America 159 million years ago. Its fossils were first found in 1877. It grew up to 65.5 feet (20 m) long; even so, it was easy prey for large predators such as Allosaurus. It could weigh up to 22 tons (20 metric tons), and it walked on four feet, which prevented it from running quickly enough to easily escape. Giants of the Mesozoic Giant herbivores dominated the Earth. However, increasing diversity also brought increasing competition. The large sauropods, such as Diplodocus , and ornithischians, such as the stegosaurids, had to watch out for larger theropods, such as Megalosaurus , as well as for hordes of small, swift predators, such as Compsognathus . The first bird to descend from small dinosaurs appeared. Megalosaurus In 1676, the bones of one of the first dinosaurs were found in southern England, although they were not identified as such until 1819. This theropod predator was highly intelligent in comparison to its peers. It lived 181 million years ago, grew up to 29.5 feet (9 m) long, and weighed 1.1 tons (1 metric ton). It walked on its two hind legs and had two powerful front claws. MEGALOSAURUS means “large lizard.” DRYOSAURUS means “oak reptile.” CAMARASAURUS means “chambered lizard.” Dryosaurus Megalosaurus Camarasaurus Brachiosaurus Brachiosaurus For a long time, this sauropod was the largest dinosaur for which we had a complete skeleton. It was a four-footed herbivore with a small brain and a long neck. Specimens have been found in the United States, on the Iberian Peninsula, and in northern and southern Africa. The African species were from the Cretaceous Period and had slight anatomical differences. LEGS Its front legs were longer than its hind legs. BRACHIOSAURUS Brachiosaurus Size 82 feet (25 m) Diet Herbivorous Habitat Tree-lined Savannas Epoch Late Jurassic Range North America COMPARATIVE SCALE VERTEBRAE Brachiosaurus's extremely long neck had 13 vertebrae, with deep and complex cavities covered by membranes. It had 11 or 12 vertebrae in its back. Its short tail had about 50 bones, which helped it move easily. Height of Brachiosaurus, because of its long front legs and long neck 42.6 feet (13 m) TAIL Its tail was small in comparison to its body and was an extension of its spinal column. HEAD Its head was small and had a crest between the eyes. This crest had large nasal cavities at the top. Its teeth were like pegs and had spaces between them. 34.8 inches (88.5 cm) NECK The length of its neck, in proportion to the rest of its body, sets it apart from other sauropods of its time. By means of its neck, which could be up to 42.5 feet (13 m) long, it could reach the tops of trees. Vertebral Joint The vertebrae were fused to strengthen the neck. Hollow Bones made the neck lighter. Ease of Movement was made possible by a ball-and-socket joint. Support This area anchored the supporting muscles. Te e t h were used for tearing off tree branches when the head was pulled backward. Nasal Cavities They are believed to have been resonance chambers. Eye Sockets Its eyes sat in large sockets. Jugal (Yoke) Bone was located behind the upper jaw and under the eye."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"20 DINOSAURS REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 21 T his striking dinosaur is one of the most widely studied in the history of paleontology. The first fossils were discovered by Othniel C. Marsh in 1877 in the American West, during the “Bone Wars.” This quadruped herbivore could measure up to 29.5 feet (9 m) long and weigh up to 2.2 tons (2 metric tons). Because of its small head, it has been used since the 19th century as a symbol of stupidity. It was later shown that most dinosaurs had small brains and that Stegosaurus 's brain was larger than average. WHERE IT LIVED The first fossils were found in Colorado. Other specimens have since been found in India, western Europe, southern Africa, and China. Caudal Plate Dorsal Plate Cervical Plate Stegosaurus was an ornithischian dinosaur that belonged to the family Stegosauridae. Its distinctive features included wide plates on its back and four spines, up to 24 inches (60 cm) long, on its tail. The function of these features is still under debate, but it is believed that they served mainly for self-defense. Stegosaurus was an easy victim for the great predators of its time, such as Allosaurus , but it is also believed that it may have been hunted by packs of small predators, such as Ornitholestes . It is doubtful that Stegosaurus could raise itself up on its hind legs, so it probably fed mostly on low bushes. A Docile Vegetarian STEGOSAURUS Stegosaurus armatus Size 29.5 feet (9 m) Diet Herbivorous Habitat Subtropical Forests Epoch Late Jurassic Range North America PLATES These triangular bony structures were not very solid, but they had a complex network of veins. The plates were likely used to regulate the animal's body temperature or even for courtship. Head Its lightweight head had small teeth that were of little use for chewing, so it swallowed plants whole. Legs Its front legs were half as long as its hind legs. Each foot had five wide, short toes. Ta i l Stegosaurus 's only real defense was likely the four spines on its tail, which it swung back and forth."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"22 DINOSAURS The Cretaceous Period W as an age of expansion. The dinosaurs continued to diversify, and the first snakes appeared. The Earth began to look like the planet we know today. The movement of tectonic plates created folds that came to form some of the mountain ranges of today, such as the Appalachians in North America and the Alps in Europe. At the end of this period, another mass extinction event occurred, probably caused by the impact of a meteorite. REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 23 ÁFRICA INDIA EURASIA NORTH AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA ANTARCTICA FLOWERS During this period, the main advancement in the evolution of plants was the appearance of angiosperms, or plants with flowers and fruit. The Cretaceous Period held the greatest diversity of dinosaurs. This epoch is also known for small mammals, insects, and the largest flying reptiles. Fauna An Evolving Planet During this period of 80 million years, the Earth's climate changed. Its temperate climate, accompanied by snow in the polar regions during the winter, was transformed into a warm, mild climate with noticeably different seasons. The ocean levels rose, currents increased ocean temperatures, and marine fauna multiplied. On land, the first flowering plants (gymnosperms) appeared, and forests of willow, maple, and oak harbored the last large dinosaurs. ALPINE MOUNTAIN-BUILDING During this period, Africa and Eurasia drifted closer together. The Tethys Sea narrowed, and the collision of plates formed the Alpine mountain range. MARINE REPTILES The expanding seas caused an abundance of marine reptiles and other aquatic species, such as mollusks. During the early Cretaceous Period, ferns and conifers predominated. Important groups became extinct at the boundary between the Early and Late Cretaceous. These species were replaced in tropical forest environments by flowering plants, which spread to colder and drier areas.

FLYING REPTILES developed very large wingspans toward the end of this period. FORESTS Oaks and maples predominated in the most humid regions. MILLION YEARS AGO The Earth began to adopt an appearance similar to that of today. Africa and South America separated from one another, as did North America and Europe. The North and South American plates drifted westward and collided with the Pacific plate, raising both the Rocky Mountains in North America and the Andes in South America. 140 TO 65"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"24 DINOSAURS REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 25 A Fierce Era Third Digit Second Digit Main Claw T he Cretaceous Period saw both the splendor and the end of the “Age of Reptiles.” It was the longest period of the Mesozoic Era, and for 80 million years, specific types of animal life developed in each region. South America was home to the largest herbivore known, Argentinosaurus huinculensis , which lived at the same time as the fearsome theropods. Some species of this period later survived the mass extinction—especially marine invertebrates, such as crustaceans, gastropod mollusks, and advanced ray-finned fish. Small mammals such as Zalambdalestes also survived. Suchomimus Caudipteryx Corythosaurus  Therizinosaurus Therizinosaurus Some scientists believe that this mysterious dinosaur was herbivorous. However, it has been classified as a theropod that lived during the Late Cretaceous in the region of the Gobi Desert in Mongolia. It was first identified in 1954, and its name means “scythe lizard.” It was between 26 and 39.5 feet (8-12 m) long and weighed about 5 tons (4.5 metric tons). It was believed to have possessed a lifestyle similar to modern gorillas or the extinct giant ground sloths. AN ENIGMATIC DINOSAUR This dinosaur, one of the most perplexing of all, has been identified by fossils of its claws and a few other fragments that have been found. It is believed to share a common ancestor with the oviraptors. According to one theory, it was an easy prey for predators such as Tarbosaurus despite the size of its claws, which it probably did not use for defense. THERIZINOSAURUS Therizinosaurus cheloniformis Size 39.5 feet (12 m) Diet Herbivorous (?) Habitat Subtropical Forests Epoch Late Cretaceous Range Central Asia COMPARISON OF SIZES HEAD The head, atop a long neck, was small, and it had a beak-shaped mouth. LEGS Its lower limbs had four small claws. CLAWS Its most notable characteristic was the large claws on its front limbs, each of which could measure up to 40 inches (1 m) long. The claw on its first digit was the longest of the three. It is believed that it used its claws to pull large branches to its mouth. ARMS Its arms could measure up to 7.9 feet (2.4 m) long and were tipped with three digits that ended in powerful claws. The size of one of the claws on its front limbs 40 inches The Struggle to Survive Dinosaurs remained dominant during the Cretaceous Period. Although the large sauropods still existed, new groups emerged, intensifying the competition for resources. Enormous carnivores of the tyrannosaur family in North America and the giganotosaurs in South America were the largest threats to the peaceful herbivores. New, distinctive species, such as the duck-billed hadrosaurs and the armored Triceratops , also appeared. Suchomimus Similar to a crocodile, this dinosaur was a dangerous theropod that lived in northern Africa during the middle of the Cretaceous Period. It could measure up to 42.5 feet (13 m) long and 16.5 feet (5 m) tall. It had a long snout with almost 100 teeth. Corythosaurus was an ornithischian dinosaur of the hadrosaur family with a showy crest. It could reach up to 33 feet (10 m) long. It ate bushes and fruit in forests, and it lived in herds. The color of its crest may have been a distinctive feature if herds of different species intermingled. Its upper jaw had hundreds of small teeth that were replaced often. CORYTHOSAURUS means “helmet lizard.” CAUDIPTERYX means “tail feather.” SUCHOMIMUS means “crocodile imitator.” Caudipteryx was a feathered dinosaur that lived in China in the early Cretaceous. It could grow up to 40 inches (1 m) in length and 27.5 inches (70 cm) in height. It was an advanced theropod, but it looked like a large bird, because its arms were covered with feathers and it had an elaborate, fanlike tail. It had claws and a beak with sharp upper teeth. It could reach great speeds when fleeing large predators.

Fossils of Giganotosaurus carolinii were first found by Rubén Carolini, a mechanic and amateur paleontologist, in 1993. The name means “giant southern lizard.” Although only 70 percent of its skeleton was found, it is known that it could reach a length of up to 49 feet (15 m) and that it hunted large sauropods. WHERE IT LIVED The fossils of this giant predator were found in the province of Neuquén in the region of Patagonia in Argentina. Giganotosaurus carolinii belonged to the order Saurischia, the suborder Theropoda, and the superfamily Allosauridae. It could measure up to 16.5 feet (5 m) in height and weigh 8.8 tons (8 metric tons). The fossilized bones that have been found for this dinosaur include the skull, pelvis, femur, spinal column, and upper limbs. It was thought to hunt in packs, because several fossils have been found together. This made it a deadly threat to the large, herbivorous sauropods of the time.

Each tooth could be up to 8 inches (20 cm) long. Tail Filled with solid vertebrae, it was used to maintain balance and could probably swing from side to side. Swift Hunter Giganotosaurus's well- developed hind legs enabled it to run at high speed while hunting its prey. Claws Both the hind legs and the front legs had three toes. The front limbs had sharp claws. Large Head Its head was very large in relation to its body, measuring up to 5.9 feet (1.8 m) long. A New King For a time, Tyrannosaurus rex was considered the largest land predator, although it is now believed by some to have been a scavenger. In 1997, a larger and more fearsome predator was made known to the scientific community.

During the Cretaceous Period, intense volcanic activity on Earth caused frequent, copious eruptions of lava and ash that exterminated the dinosaurs. Over 386 square miles (1,000 sq km) of volcanic rock deposited on the Deccan Plateau in India lend credence to this scientific hypothesis of the Cretaceous extinction. E xtinctions of living beings on Earth have occurred in a series of drastic episodes throughout history, from the Cambrian Period to the Cretaceous. The most famous chapter is associated with the total disappearance of the dinosaurs about 65.5 million years ago. This mass extinction of these large reptiles is so important that it was used by scientists to indicate the end of the Cretaceous Period and the beginning of the Tertiary, a designation known as the K-T boundary (“K” is the abbreviation for Cretaceous). Natural phenomena of terrestrial or extraterrestrial origin are possible causes of the disappearance of these gigantic animals of the Mesozoic Era. CLUES IN CHICXULUB In the town of Chicxulub, on the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, a depression was found that measured 112 miles (180 km) across. This enormous imprint was evidence of the violent impact of an extremely large meteorite that crashed into the Earth. ATOMIC BOMBS like the one dropped on Hiroshima equal the force of the impact of one meteorite measuring 6 miles (10 km) in diameter. million 50 Other Proposed Theories Not all scientists agree with the idea that a large meteorite caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. Rather, they suggest that the Chicxulub crater was formed 300,000 years before the end of the Cretaceous Period. These scientists claim that terrestrial events, such as volcanic eruptions, were more likely to have caused the Cretaceous extinction. According to intermediate positions, the eruptions may have been caused by a large meteorite impact.

From the Paleozoic Era 570 million years ago to the Cretaceous Period, it has been determined that there were five or six mass extinctions on Earth, which mark the boundaries between the following periods: Cambrian-Ordovician, Ordovician-Silurian, Devonian-Carboniferous, and Permian-Cretaceous. However, scientists have yet to determine a convincing factor that could be the cause in all cases. The Devonian extinction exterminated 50 percent of all species, much like the one occurring at the K- T boundary.

Their skin is hard, dry, and flaky. Like birds, most reptiles are born from eggs deposited on land. The offspring hatch fully formed without passing through a larval stage. The first reptiles appeared during the height of the Carboniferous Period in the Paleozoic Era. During the Mesozoic Era, they evolved and flourished, which is why this period is also known as the age of reptiles. Only 5 of the 23 orders that existed then have living representatives today. 32 REPTILES: BACKGROUND SKIN Dry, thick, and impermeable, it protects the body from dehydrating even in very hot, dry climates. THE TONGUE Large, protractile, and bifid, a reptile's tongue is very short and thick, and it contains the taste organs. LUNGS Since the ribs are fused with the shell, turtles cannot move their ribs to inhale. They use the muscles in the upper part of their legs to produce a pumping motion and inhale air. SKELETON is almost entirely ossified (not cartilaginous). THORAX AND ABDOMEN are not separated by a diaphragm. Alligators breathe with the help of muscles on the walls of their body. ECTOTHERMIC The body temperature of reptiles depends on the environment—they cannot regulate it internally. This is why higher temperatures increase their vitality. They regulate their temperature by taking advantage of different sources of external heat, such as direct sunlight and stones, tree trunks, and patches of ground that have been heated by the sun. Squamata This order constitutes the largest group of living reptiles and includes more than 6,000 species of lizards and snakes. The majority of animals in this order have bodies that are covered with corneous scales. The squamata include three forms of reptiles that are somewhat different from each other: the amphisbaenians, the lizards, and the snakes. It also contains certain extinct forms of reptiles, including pythonomorpha, which had snakelike bodies and lizard-like feet. Chelonians The order of the testudines differentiated itself from the rest of the reptile world during the Triassic Period. Today it comprises marine turtles and terrestrial turtles. The species of this order are unique. They are covered with shells that consist of a dorsal carapace and a ventral plastron. These shells are so much a part of these animals that their thoracic vertebrae and ribs are included in them. Since these rigid shells do not allow turtles to expand their chests to breathe, these animals use their abdominal and pectoral muscles like diaphragms. Crocodiles are distinguished by their usually large size. From neck to tail, their backs are covered in rows of bony plates, which can give the impression of thorns or teeth. Crocodiles appeared toward the end of the Triassic Period, and they are the closest living relatives to both dinosaurs and birds. Their hearts are divided into four chambers, their brains show a high degree of development, and the musculature of their abdomens is so developed that it resembles the gizzards of birds. The larger species are very dangerous.

They live on every continent except Antarctica, and most countries have at least one species of terrestrial reptile. They can be found in the driest and hottest deserts, as well as the steamiest, most humid rainforests. They are especially common in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas, where high temperatures and a great diversity of prey allow them to thrive. OVIPAROUS Most reptiles are oviparous (they lay eggs); however, many species of snakes and lizards are ovoviviparous (they give birth to live offspring). EYES are almost always small. In diurnal animals, the pupil is rounded. NICTITATING MEMBRANE extends forward from the internal angle of the eye and covers it.

Among these adaptations, the amniotic egg stands out, but equally important were the development of sex organs that favored internal copulation, an impermeable skin, and the formation of a low volume of urine that eliminates uric acid instead of urea. These adaptations to its environment were necessary to the reptilian dominance of the greater part of the Mesozoic Era. SKIN was smooth and slippery.

It inhabited North America during the Upper Cretaceous (between 75 and 65 million years ago). An omnivorous feeder, it passed slowly through shallow waters by means of the propulsion provided by its flippers. The females laid eggs in holes just like the sea turtles of today. Tough Skin Scutosaurs were quadrupeds with massive legs, similar to strong columns with wide bases, which sustained the weight of their bodies. These reptiles belonged to the extinct genus Scutosaurus species. They were large herbivores that lumbered through the pines and firs of Permian forests in search of food, such as herbs and soft buds. Sea Crocodiles This genus of reptiles owes its name to its members' long snouts. The sea crocodile was a dangerous hunter, capable and opportunistic. It preyed on squid and pterosaurs, and it chased fish up to 20 feet (6 m) long—twice its own size. Its tail got thinner toward its end, which had a flipper. There was a small bump between its eyes.

The diapsid lineage originated with them. ANAPSID A group of reptiles without openings in the skull near the temples. This is the condition seen in fish, amphibians, and earlier reptiles. Today's turtles belong to this lineage. DIAPSID During the Permian Period, another group of reptiles emerged that had temporal openings in the skull behind each eye socket.

The tuatara is the last living sphenodont, and, because it has changed very little from its original form, it is called a living fossil. Two known species of tuatara have been identified, both of which inhabit the islands that lie off the coast of New Zealand. They live in burrows, and their great tolerance for cold allows them to survive at very low temperatures. Tuataras grow slowly and can live up to 80 years. REPRODUCTION Females are ready to mate once every four years. The male—the only modern living reptile without a penis—uses its cloaca to transfer its sperm directly into the female cloaca. PINEAL EYE can be distinguished in younger specimens. In adults, it is covered by the scales that grow over it. HEAD is large compared to the body, and it lacks auditory structures.

Thanks to their dry, scaly skin and their excretion of uric acid instead of urea, they minimize water loss. The heart distributes blood in a double circuit. Crocodiles were the first vertebrates to have a four-chambered heart; the separation of the ventricles is incomplete in all other reptiles. The lungs, developed beyond those of amphibians, contribute to cardiac efficiency by allowing for greater exchange of gases. Respiratory System is completely pulmonary. Most reptiles possess a pair of functional lungs, with the exception of snakes, which have only one functional lung. Body-wall muscles generate the pressure differences necessary to circulate air through the airways from the nasal cavities to the pulmonary alveoli. Circulatory System Nile crocodiles have double circulation. A minor circuit brings deoxygenated blood to the lungs and transports oxygenated blood from them, and a major circuit transports the oxygenated blood to the rest of the body and returns deoxygenated blood to the heart. Reptile hearts have two auricles (atria) and a single ventricle, which is partially divided by an incomplete ventricle partition. MOUTH is closed by strong muscles. The rear portion contains a membrane that prevents water from entering while the animal is diving. ESOPHAGUS SMALL INTESTINE SPLEEN CLOACA Shared opening of the excretory, reproductive, and digestive ducts A Question of Skin The absence of extremities and the friction produced during movement give snakes the ability to slide and to shed their skin in one motion.

Lizards usually feed on insects. Snakes usually feed on small vertebrates like birds, rodents, fish, amphibians, or even other reptiles. For many, the eggs of birds and other reptiles make a very succulent meal. The painted turtle is omnivorous: it eats meat and plants. Reptiles and other species are part of a larger food chain—animals eat other animals, preserving the equilibrium of the environment. GREEN IGUANA Also called the common iguana, it is one of the few herbivorous reptiles. It feeds on green leaves as well as on some fruits. SNAKES can expand both their mouths and parts of their digestive tracts to swallow their prey whole. Their teeth and fangs are not for chewing but for hunting, poisoning, and retaining their prey. CROCODILES feast on invertebrates and other vertebrates. Crocodile young mainly consume terrestrial and aquatic invertebrates, whereas the adults feed primarily on fish. Carnivores The tools in a predator reptile's kit include an opportunistic instinct, well-developed reflexes, mucous glands in the mouth that lubricate its prey, a potent immune system, and a tongue with olfactory nerve endings. Herbivores This diet is generally typical of other groups of animals; however, there are reptiles that feed only on green leaves and plants. The marine iguana eats only the algae that it finds under rocks on the sea floor. Omnivores Turtles may be slow, but many include mollusks, worms, and slow-moving insect larvae among the items on their otherwise vegetarian menu. The loggerhead sea turtle, which measures over 6.5 feet (2 m) long, eats sponges, mollusks, crustaceans, fish, and algae.

Marine turtles, especially green turtles, travel to the coast to lay their eggs in the sand, where they are left at the mercy of all who pass by. The females of other species, however, fiercely protect their offspring, staying near their nests for long periods of time to scare away potential predators. Eggshells Reptile offspring develop within a liquid-filled sac called the amnion, which lies inside the egg. Most reptile eggs have soft, flexible shells, but some have much harder shells.

One of these is the marine iguana, the only species of iguana in the world that spends most of its time in the water. This reptile lives on the rocky coasts and feeds on seaweed and algae. It can stay underwater for 45 minutes and dive approximately 50 feet (15 m) deep. This unique, slow-swimming creature gathers seaweed to eat at low tide or dives for food. HIGH TIDE 12 hours LOW TIDE 12 hours Sea Level MARINE IGUANA Amblyrhynchus cristatus Habit Semi-aquatic Length 20-40 inches (50-100 cm) Range Galapagos Islands The Galapagos Islands consist of 13 major islands, six small islands, and many islets, all of which are volcanic in origin. Located along the Equator, some 620 miles (1,000 km) west of the South American landmass, they are part of the territory of Ecuador. Their climate varies widely because of the different ocean currents that converge around the archipelago. Because of their isolation, they are home to many indigenous species, most of which are birds and reptiles. LEGS are kept to the side of the body while swimming. SPINES The crest is usually larger in males. When fighting for a female, they strike their crests against their opponents. SCALY BACK SALT Between its eyes and its nostrils, the marine iguana has glands to expel salt from its body. By exhaling strongly, it emits a jet of air that scatters the salt, which falls on its head and forms a white crest. TAIL can be used as a whip in self-defense. SEAWEED The different kinds of seaweed that grow on the islands may cause these reptiles to vary in color from one island to another.

This animal, found only on the Galapagos Islands, swims very slowly and with very little energy. The fastest swimming speed recorded for a marine iguana was 2.8 feet (0.85 m) per second, and it only maintained this pace for two minutes. The average speed for a marine iguana is a mere 1.5 feet (0.45 m) per second, and only the largest iguanas are strong enough to swim above the waves. 45 MINUTES UNDERWATER WITHOUT AIR is the maximum amount of time that a marine iguana can stay submerged while looking for food. CLAWS are longer and sharper than those of land- dwelling iguanas, allowing the animals to cling to rocks to avoid being swept away by waves. Intermediate Zone They walk or dive for food, depending on the tide level. Out of the wather They sun themselves on the coast, where their colonies live. Diving Zone Seaweed is abundant but can only be reached by diving. Seaweed Its tail is thick and flat. Wavelike movements of its body propel it forward. Its legs are bent to the side. Life in Colonies The marine iguana is native to the Galapagos Islands and is the only lizard that finds its food in the sea. It lives in colonies, which is a curiosity given the solitary behavior of other iguanas. When they are not feeding, marine iguanas stretch out on rocks to warm in the sun. Thousands may be seen on one area of the beach. However, their peaceful coexistence disappears during mating season when males fight aggressively over females. The females reestablish harmony at nesting time. Since there is little space for the nests, thousands of females lay their eggs together. Each one can lay from one to six eggs, which are placed in a sandy burrow. Feeding Habits The largest marine iguanas eat seaweed in the water, but the smaller and younger ones do not. Although adult iguanas can dive to a depth of about 50 feet (15 m), in normal conditions they feed at low tide in dives that last less than 10 minutes. Young iguanas, however, stay out of the water because their body temperature could fall rapidly. They can only feed on seaweed that grows on exposed rocks and is deposited at high tide.

Some species live in deserts, and many have burrows or make their homes in rock crevices. They are nocturnal and can flee from their predators by voluntarily shedding their tails. Geckos are the only lizards whose males produce sounds to attract females and to defend their territory. These agile climbers can walk on smooth vertical surfaces or even upside down by using tiny hairs on their feet that let them stick to anything they touch. Its tail is autotomic, meaning that the gecko can shed it, allowing the reptile to double its speed. Its muscular legs are those of a great climber. A gecko's skin is covered with tiny scales. The texture of its skin helps it to blend into its environment. SPECIES ARE IN THE GECKO FAMILY 1,050 Leaf-Tailed Gecko When hanging by its tail, it looks exactly like a leaf, which gave rise to its common name. Male geckos can produce sounds similar to vocalized calls. In this species, they are especially loud and high-pitched. Spreading Its Limbs The membranes between its toes are used as wings for gliding. A Arching Its Back The membranes along its sides and flat tail help it to regulate its fall. B Flight of the Gecko The Kuhl's flying gecko lives in trees in Southeast Asia. Unlike flying lizards, it glides with its webbed feet. When it is not “flying,” it spends most of its time hanging head down in the trees, ready for a rapid takeoff. Scaly Eyes Unlike most lizards, geckos do not have movable eyelids. Their eyes are covered with a transparent membrane that they shed periodically, along with the rest of their skin. Using its long, sticky tongue, the gecko cleans the membrane over its eyes and keeps it free of dust. Geckos cannot blink. They have only a fixed lens, with an iris that enlarges in darkness. Claw Rows of Setae A Rare Phenomenon Scientists have explained the gecko's capacity to cling (which even enables them to climb glass and never get it dirty) through electrostatic principles and even microphysics.

Another interesting fact is that their tongue can stretch great distances in seconds. They live mostly in Africa. Their prehensile tails and toes make them excellent climbers. Another helpful characteristic is that their eyes can move independently of one another, providing them a 360° field of vision. Their flat bodies help them to balance and to hide among the leaves. Protractible Tongue Long and lightweight, the chameleon's tongue is sticky and can be extended. Chameleons throw their tongues outward like projectiles to hunt their prey. Contraction Several sheets of collagen between the tongue and the accelerating muscle are compressed in the form of a spiral, which stores the energy necessary to propel the tongue outward. 1 Unfolding The accelerating muscle compresses the energy-storing collagen tissues, launching the tongue toward its target. 2 Retraction When the elastic tissues contract again, they roll up the tongue and return it to its initial position with the prey sticking to it. 3 TONGUE Covered with collagen tissue. Feeding Habits These diurnal hunters wait for victims to pass by. Their diet includes arthropods and small invertebrates. Among insects, they prefer crickets, grubs, cockroaches, and moths. Other species on the menu also include songbirds and mice. The color-changing ability of chameleons, well known in popular sayings and songs, is not an adaptation to the environment as is widely believed. Rather it is related to changes in light and temperature, courtship behaviors, or the presence of a predator. Color changes are caused by the action of hormones on pigment cells in the skin. These specialized cells, located in each layer of the dermis, react and change color, camouflaging the chameleon from its predators.

They belong to the same group that included the dinosaurs and have changed very little in the last 65 million years. They can go for long periods without moving; during these times, they sun themselves or rest in the water. However, they can also swim, jump, and even run at high speed to attack with force and precision. In spite of their ferocity, female crocodiles provide more care for their young than any other living group of reptiles. The Gavial is the strangest of all crocodiles. Its long, narrow snout with small, sharp teeth sweeps through the water. Its interlocked, outward-curving teeth are perfect for catching slippery fish. Adult males drive away their rivals with loud buzzing sounds that they make by exhaling air through a bump on their noses. Alligators and Caimans Alligators and caimans are almost completely limited to freshwater. They make their nests by piling up grass, dirt, and leaves to lay their hard-shelled eggs. The female often remains near the nest to keep would-be thieves from invading. Although they look clumsy, alligators can use their jaws with precision. The female often helps her eggs to hatch by putting them in her mouth, where she rolls them against her palate with her tongue until they crack. Crocodiles have four feet. In this way, they are very similar to lizards. They are distinguished by their great size and ferocity. Several rows of bony plates that look like spines or teeth run down the length of their back. They can stay in the water for long periods of time, and they are able to swallow underwater without drowning. They make their nests in holes on the beach.

These fierce reptiles live exclusively in the tropical regions of the Americas, mainly in lakes and swampy regions. Occasionally, when looking for food, they enter areas populated by humans. The caiman family includes the genera Caiman , Melanosuchus , and Paleosuchus . The largest species is the black caiman, so named because of the color of its hide. Melanosuchus niger BLACK CAIMAN The black caiman is distinguished from other caimans by dark stripes on the lower part of its mouth and yellow lines along the sides of its body. However, it is similar to other caimans in its feeding habits, which depend on its age. Young caimans feed on arthropods and amphibians, while adults eat fish, birds, and mammals, or snails if other foods are scarce. Caimans do not have a large appetite. For example, in captivity they consume only 14 ounces (400 g) of meat twice a week. Black Predator Caimans mate in the water. Once the eggs have been fertilized, the females begin to build their nest, forming a mound out of dry vegetation and earth. With their hind legs, they dig a hole in the center where they lay their eggs—from 30 to 75 at a time. When finished, they cover the nest with earth. In some cases, the females return to the water and have nothing more to do with the eggs. Reproduction Caimans' teeth are not used for chewing or cutting but to trap, hold, and puncture the bodies of their prey. When a caiman's victim is large, such as a capybara or a wild boar, it twists its body in the water to tear off a chunk and swallow it. Caimans also hide their prey underwater to soften their body tissues. This makes it easier to rip off mouthfuls of flesh, which they swallow whole.

Turtles can live on land, in freshwater, or in saltwater. However, they all need light and heat to survive, and they all lay their eggs on land. Although aquatic turtles are nearly all carnivorous, some land-dwelling species are herbivorous. Turtles' most noticeable trait is their hard shell, which encloses and protects the soft part of their bodies. It also camouflages them for protection from predator species. Ocean Species are the rarest. They live in warm waters and are excellent swimmers. They have flippers instead of feet. The front flippers move them forward, and the back flippers act as a rudder for steering. Their shells of oceanic turtles are flattened into a streamlined shape. These turtles have developed a dual respiratory system that allows them to remain submerged for up to two hours. Hawksbill Turtle Eretmochelys imbricata Sea turtles are usually heavy and large.

A Turtle's Age Counting the successive hornlike plates that grow on the shell each year allows us to determine a turtle's age. Concealed from Danger Many scientists believe that turtles' shells enabled them to survive long ago, during a time when so many other reptile species, including dinosaurs, perished. The shell consists of a domed back and a flat belly, joined by a bridge between the front and hind legs. The outer layer is made of skin and hornlike plates, and the inner layer is made of bone. Turtles draw their heads inside their shells in different ways depending on whether their necks are straight or side-bending. Land-dwelling turtles have shells that enable them to hide their legs, as well as their heads, inside, protecting their entire bodies from threats. The skeletons of ocean turtles, however, are completely integrated with their shells. On Solid Ground Land-dwelling species have the best- protected legs because they are covered by large scales. They also have the most dome-shaped shells. Many species have front legs that are adapted for digging deep burrows, which serve as a shelter in inclement weather and protect them from threats from other species. The Florida gopher tortoise ( Gopherus polyphemus ) can dig tunnels up to 33 feet (10 m) deep. Some land-dwelling species can inflict very painful scratches. 300-350 TURTLE SPECIES EXIST.

They are distinguished by their feet, which are partially or totally webbed and are used for swimming, an activity at which they are highly skilled. They can also be identified by their shells, which are flatter than those of land-dwelling turtles. Some freshwater turtles are quite well adapted to living on land. In general, they prefer warm climates with abundant vegetation, so they commonly live near swamps and rivers located in subtropical areas around the world.

LONESOME GEORGE is the nickname of the only survivor of a now extinct subspecies ( G. nigra abindoni ). FRONT LEGS are useful for climbing. HUMPED BACK enables it to stretch its neck upward. SCALES are typical of this order of reptiles. CLAWS are used for digging. BRIDGE joins the upper shell to the plastron. The Life Cycle Up to four months can pass between the time a new turtle is conceived and the time it hatches. Laying eggs takes several hours of work, and a female can lose up to 20 percent of her weight during this process. The large size of Galapagos tortoises makes them lazy; they spend most of their time sunning themselves in small groups on warm, dry volcanic soils near the coast or a swamp. Some eat carrion. Reproduction Mating is rather aggressive; the male immobilizes the female in order to mount and fertilize her. 1 2 One to Two Months Later Egg Laying During the reproductive season, the female lays eggs every two weeks and makes from three to eight nests. 3 Two Months Later Hatching After hatching, the young climb to the surface, usually at night. 4 Five Years Development The animal reaches reproductive age, although it will keep growing throughout its life. 5 40 Years Most Stable Size After this point, its rate of growth slows. THE LENGTH OF TIME A TORTOISE CAN LIVE WITHOUT EATING OR DRINKING Almost 14 months There are now 11 subspecies of Galapagos tortoises, including water-dwelling and land-dwelling varieties. All are in danger of extinction. They differ in maximum sizes, shell shapes, and neck lengths. Giants Chaco Tortoise 0.8 foot (0.25 m) Tortoise 4 feet (1.2 m) Human 6 feet (1.8 m) Main Predators In addition to suffering from poaching humans in the past, Galapagos tortoises are in danger of extinction because of the low survival rate of their hatchlings, which are hunted by two types of species that have been introduced to their habitat: black rats and cats. Furthermore, the diet of adult female tortoises causes them to compete for food with goats and other livestock, more species not native to the tortoises' ecosystem.

S ea turtles have had to adapt parts of their bodies to an aquatic environment. Their front legs propel them through the water, and their hind legs serve as rudders for steering. Their shells are highly streamlined. They can spend up to several hours submerged in the water, since they have a dual respiratory system. They lay eggs but make their nests on solid ground, and they have an interesting system for choosing the spot where their young will be born—they return to the same spot where they, themselves, were born. Sea turtles have wedge-shaped lungs that lie underneath their shells and are attached to their backs along the spine. Sea turtles can also breathe through their skin. Breathing Sea turtles' measurements vary widely by species. The largest living species is the leatherback, and the smallest is Kemp's ridley. Sizes Reproduction The reproductive cycle of sea turtles repeats every year, every two years, or every three years. Nesting is done during the summer on sandy beaches in tropical and subtropical areas where the average water temperature at the surface is always above 75° F (24° C). Every one, two, or three years, the turtles return from their feeding areas, which can be several hundred or even several thousand miles from their nesting sites. Apparently the turtles are able to memorize the exact location where they were born. They seem to navigate by ocean currents and temperatures. Habitat When winter arrives, sea turtles migrate in warm ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream, to places with higher temperatures. However, they sometimes stay too long in these currents, which then vanish, leaving the turtles in frigid water.

Like all reptiles, they have a spinal column and a skeletal structure composed of a system of vertebrae. The anatomical differences between species reveal information about their habitats and diets—climbing snakes are long and thin, burrowing snakes are shorter and thicker, and sea snakes have flat tails that they use as fins. Primitive Snakes Boas and pythons were the first snake species to appear on Earth. Many have claws or spurs as vestiges of ancient limbs of their ancestors. They are not poisonous, but they are the largest and strongest snakes. They live in trees, and some, such as the anaconda—a South American boa—live in rivers. Sophisticated Snakes Snakes of the family Viperidae, as well as other poisonous snakes that appeared later, have highly acute senses and a mouth apparatus with a system of retractable fangs for injecting venom.

For example, both boas and pythons are powerful constrictors, meaning that they kill by asphyxiating their prey rather than poisoning them with venom. Although boas and pythons belong to the same category of snakes (a category that includes the largest species in the world—the famous anaconda and reticulated python of Africa and Asia), their reproductive systems differ from one another. Their large size makes them heavy and slow moving, so they are easy prey for hunters, who kill them for their hides and meat.

This enables it to suffocate its prey by coiling itself around the prey's body and squeezing (constricting). 1 Constriction The snake seeks the head of the prey to keep it from attacking. Its entire body surrounds its prey in a deadly embrace. Every time the victim breathes, the squeeze tightens. The prey dies of suffocation. 2 Widest Opening When the prey is dead, the snake releases its grip and begins to feed. It swallows the head first and gradually releases the rest of the body from its coils. The time it takes to eat the prey depends on the animal's size and ranges from a few minutes to one or two hours. 3 The skin stretches, and the scales separate.

Most snakes have small skulls with jawbones that can be separated voluntarily by sliding them along a kind of perpendicular rail, which consists of a bone called the quadrate. This greatly increases the size of the snake's mouth. 74 TURTLES AND SNAKES Boas and pythons are called primitive, since they have neither fangs nor venom. These snakes have several rows of small, inward-curving teeth used for holding prey and swallowing quickly without letting the prey worm out. This feature is necessary for the snakes to be able to hold onto their prey, since they lack venom. Venomous snakes, on the other hand, have little need to worry about their prey escaping, since they know that, after it is injected with the toxic substance, it will not be able to get very far. Primitive Snakes Viperid This type of skull has small teeth and large, retractable fangs that are thick or hooked. 1 A Specialized Mouth T he most primitive snakes have heavy skulls and few teeth. Most snakes, however, have lighter skulls and jointed jawbones. These joints are loose and can easily become dislocated so that the snake can swallow prey larger than the natural shape of its own head. The teeth are fixed in the upper jaw or the palate, and the fangs for injecting venom may be located either at the front or at the back of the mouth. Some species, as well as being large and powerful, have retractable fangs, allowing them to close their mouths when their fangs are not in use. 6.6 feet (2 m) THE DISTANCE FROM WHICH THE SPITTING COBRA CAN KILL BY SPRAYING ITS VENOM Venom System consists of the two Duvernoy's glands, one on each side of the skull, which produce venom and are connected to the fangs. When biting, muscle contractions exert pressure on the gland and activate the injection mechanism. Injecting Fangs Cobra species expel their venom in different ways depending on their fangs. The angle and direction of the opening determine how forcefully the liquid is injected. NON-SPITTING The long canal points downward and has a beveled edge at the end. The stream loses momentum. SPITTING The canal's opening points forward and is narrow so that it can eject the venom more forcefully. Spitting Venom Forty cobra species can spray their venom from a distance. They spray in self-defense when they feel threatened. They can direct the stream into an enemy's eyes, causing grave damage or even death. The shape of their fangs is essential to this defense. BLACK-NECKED COBRA Naja nigricolis It has a jaw with a spur, but it does not actually spit. BLACK AND WHITE COBRA Naja melanoleuca It must bite its prey in order to inject venom.

Easily recognized by their outspread hoods, they are well known worldwide, mostly because of their use by snake charmers. Many cobra species carry deadly venom. Some can even spit from several yards away. Cobras of the Naja genus are the most widely recognized. They are widespread in Asia and were only recently recognized as 11 separate species. All are predatory; many eat only snakes. MONOCLE Made of two concentric rings, it is easily recognizable because of its white color. BACK The scales are closer together. BANDS are usually found on the belly. ASIAN COBRA Naja naja It is the most widespread species on the Indian subcontinent and one of the best known. Its distinctive trait is the mark on its hood, similar to a pair of glasses, which gives this snake its other name: spectacled cobra. MONOCLED COBRA Naja kaouthia This Asian species has soft scales.

The large parietal scales follow a line that usually differs among species. The sublabial scales are also widely used in identification. Usually there are five, but the number varies between species. The ventral scales are perhaps most easily used for identification, because they differ notably from one group to another. They are always wide, cover the entire body, and are divided into sections: neck, belly, and tail. It is believed that when cobras feel threatened or are about to attack, they spread their hoods by widening their necks in order to look larger than they actually are. The mechanism involves the ribs, which are widened by the muscles that lie between them. When cobras put on this display, they are ready to strike. Some species also hiss while in this position.

In Egypt, crocodiles were venerated, and valuable jewels were given in their honor. The snake is also mentioned in sacred Hebrew texts. SNAKE The dragon with the body of a snake is invoked in China and Japan to drive away bad spirits. DRAGON In classical mythology, the dragon is associated with the ideas of guardianship and protection. EVE The snake is associated with trickery and treason in the Old Testament. It is the snake that incited Eve to enter into sin in the Garden of Eden by convincing her to eat forbidden fruit. Representations The engraving of a snake biting its tail to form a circle was the emblem of the so-called seal of Solomon that was used by theosophical societies. In Buddhism, the snake represents natural tendencies toward aggression. However, in medicine, it has long been associated with an ancient Greek symbol, the “rod of Asclepius,” which had a snake coiled around it. Asclepius was the Greco- Roman god of healing. CROCODILE There is evidence that, in the 5th century BC, the Egyptians raised crocodiles as pets. A crocodile lived in a tank in the temple of Sebek and was pampered with the finest of foods. SIVA Known in India as the god of destruction, Siva is depicted holding a snake around his neck. QUETZALCÓATL is the Nahuatl name for the Feathered Serpent.

In Asia—especially India—snake charmers carry out a very dramatic performance that has been repeated since ancient times. Snake charming has since spread all the way to the Mediterranean coast of Africa. The technique of enchanting snakes requires a knowledge of their weaknesses. For example, it is the movement of the flute, not its actual sound, to which they respond. Enchanted Snakes A Historical Practice Revered since antiquity, the charming of snakes is a tradition that had its golden age during the period of imperial expansion, when the West colonized the East. Snake charmers were considered exotic, and they traveled the world and performed at fairs in large cities. They became veritable ambassadors of the East.

This feature allows it to crawl into narrow cracks to escape from predatory birds and mammals. It can also squeeze itself into holes. PANCAKE TORTOISE Malacochersus tornieri"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"88 HUMANS AND REPTILES Meat Uncontrolled exploitation of turtles occurs to support massive consumption. Shells Tortoise shells are taken to produce jewels and decorations. Turtles Illegal trafficking arises from the demand for turtles as pets. S ea turtles are in danger of extinction. During their migrations, they eat the bait set on hooks intended for tuna. As the turtles fight to free themselves from the hooks, they damage their internal organs and lose their buoyancy, which causes them to die from asphyxiation. Fishing nets are also mortal traps for sea turtles. Certain governmental and private organizations are seeking ways to reduce the danger for these turtles and their future offspring. Turtle Excluder Devices (TED) Sea turtles, such as the Laud, lay eggs on the Atlantic coasts of French Guiana and Suriname. They can only make it there, however, if they overcome the obstacle of deep fishing nets in the sea. To help them overcome this threat without interrupting the fishing of shrimp, nets have been developed with devices that exclude turtles from capture. LONG HOOK Turtles are able to swallow these hooks, which cause them to die of internal hemorrhaging or asphyxiation. CIRCULAR HOOK The greater width of these hooks reduces the chance of turtles being caught on them or swallowing them. Thanks to this modification, the numbers of turtles caught or injured has been dramatically reduced. The presence of humans on beaches interferes with the development of turtle offspring. In order to preserve turtles, countries have joined forces with environmental nongovernmental organizations to carry out different tasks. In Suriname, people gather the eggs to protect them from illegal traffickers and corral the nests so that tourists do not destroy them. In the Caribbean basin of Costa Rica, Tortuguero National Park was established in the region home to the greatest amount of spawning green turtles. Exclusion Exit Turtle-Blocking Device The shrimp remain trapped in the net.

The most threatened species with the fewest resources for recovery are those native to islands, which are unable to emigrate or adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Urban growth, deforestation, and water contamination are among the principal forces that have created this critical situation. Conscious of the problem, many countries have developed legislation to protect reptiles, but it is not always effective. REPTILES AND DINOSAURS 91 THE LOSS OF HABITAT CAUSED BY HUMAN ACTIVITIES IS THE MAIN CAUSE OF REPTILE EXTINCTION. Ha b itat Loss Status Habitat Size Critical Turkey 2.6 feet (80 cm) This venomous, rodent-eating snake lives mostly in Anatolia. There its main threats are illegal trafficking and other human activities. Although awarded protected status in the region's animal preserves since 1994, it remains at serious risk of extinction. BULGARDAGH VIPER Vipera bulgardaghica Status Habitat Size Critical Jamaica 2.8 feet (85 cm) This reptile-eating snake inhabits the mountains of Jamaica. It is not venomous, and it is known for its great speed. Since 1994, it has been considered at critical risk of extinction because of habitat loss. Very few wild specimens have been sighted. Some experts believe that it may already be extinct. JAMAICA RACER Alsophis ater This viper inhabits just one small island on the Brazilian coast, only 106 acres (43 ha) in size, called Queimada Grande. Deforestation is its main threat. Although the snake's population is stable, the loss of its natural habitat places it in critical danger of extinction. Status Habitat Size Critical Brazil 2.6 feet (80 cm) GOLDEN FER-DE-LANCE Bothrops insularis Since the 1970s, nearly 13 subpopulations of iguanas have disappeared. Only one important species of this family of iguana remains, living in an area of 5 square miles (13 sq km) on a privately owned island. Its main threats come from predators introduced by humans and from habitat loss caused by urbanization. Status Habitat Size Critical Bahamas 14 inches (36 cm) TURKS AND CAICOS ROCK IGUANA Cyclura carinata This lizard inhabits the rocky outcroppings of El Hierro, one of the Canary Islands. Over recent decades, it was estimated that only 200 specimens remained, although the exact number is unknown. Its main cause of extinction is habitat loss and lack of food rising from competition with goats. Today these lizards are protected, and their numbers are recovering in preserves. Status Habitat Maximum Size Critical Canary Islands 2 feet (60 cm) HIERRO GIANT LIZARD Gallotia simonyi Status Habitat Size Critical Fiji 2.5 feet (75 cm) The status of this species was last reviewed in 2003. It is distinguished by its rapid color changes and by the spiny crests on its back. It inhabits coastal forests, and its greatest threat is the introduction of goats to Fiji's islands. Since 1981, the island of Yaduataba has served as a primary sanctuary dedicated to its conservation. Nevertheless, the species continues to decline. FIJI CRESTED IGUANA Brachylophus vitiensis This tiny, active chameleon is native to South Africa. As recently as a decade ago, it was commonly seen in thickets, in gardens, on plantations, and among crops. However, this species is currently at risk because of urban expansion. It is now only found on natural preserves. Status Habitat Maximum Size Critical South Africa 8 inches (20 cm) CAPE DWARF CHAMELEON Bradypodion pumilum This rare, little-known species of rattlesnake inhabits an area of Aruba of roughly 30 square miles (76 sq km). Its current status as a critically endangered species is mostly due to the loss of its ecosystem. Between 1993 and 2004, only 185 specimens were sighted in the wild. Arikok National Park is currently developing programs for the snake's conservation.
