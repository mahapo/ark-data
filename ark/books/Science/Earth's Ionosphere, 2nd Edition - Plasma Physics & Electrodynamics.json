Prior to this period, the main emphasis was on production and loss of electrons and ions by photoionization and particle beams. Ion chemistry, geomagnetic field variations, and other “aeronomical” processes formed primary subfields as well. With the development of incoherent scatter radar techniques as well as scientific satel- lites, a whole new realm of ionospheric processes became amenable to scientific study. In particular, space scientists were able to reliably probe the dynamics of the ionosphere and to realize the fundamental role played by electric fields. In a parallel development, the physics of plasmas became an important branch of science due to its role in controlled fusion research. In this book, study of the plasma physics and electrodynamics of the iono- sphere is given the highest priority, and some classical aeronomical processes are deemphasized. This is an unfortunate necessity, but the text by Rishbeth and Garriott (1969), published in the same International Geophysics Series, remains a valuable treatise on these topics, and a new publication by Schunk and Nagy (2000) is excellent in this area. The ionosphere is somewhat of a battleground between the earth’s neutral atmosphere and the sun’s fully ionized atmosphere in which the earth is imbed- ded. One of the challenges of ionosphere research is to know enough about these two vast fields of research to make sense out of ionospheric phenomena. We try to give the reader some insights into how these competing sources of mass, momen- tum, and energy vie for control of the ionosphere. Unlike the first edition, we now include the D region of the ionosphere. Because the neutral atmosphere so dominates the physics, we include discussions of turbulence throughout the text where appropriate. The huge increases in dusty/icy plasma physics and the role polar mesospheric clouds may play in Global Change are reasons to include this region. After some introductory material, the study is begun in earnest with the equa- torial ionosphere. Here the earth’s magnetic field is horizontal and many unique and fascinating phenomena occur. It is interesting to note also that the Coriolis force vanishes at the geographic equator, which makes for some unusual ocean and atmospheric dynamics as well. In Chapter 3 the electrodynamics of this zone are studied, and plasma instabilities are discussed in Chapter 4. This particular chapter is extended greatly from the first edition."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"xiv Preface In Chapter 5 the midlatitude zone is studied, and, in particular, the role of gravity waves and neutral wind dynamics is emphasized. This is the ionospheric footprint of that portion of the near-space region of the earth that is dominated by the planet’s rotation. Due to the explosion of information on midlatitude instabilities, a new Chapter 6 has been written. The role of the neutral wind in these instabilities simply was not recognized in the 1980s. An entirely new chapter dealing with the polar summer mesosphere has been written due to the huge increase in interest and our understanding of this region. The role of charged ice in an icy (or dusty) plasma has led to this new interest, as has the possibility of global change being detected early in this region. In Chapter 8 the interaction of the solar wind with the magnetic field of the earth is reviewed, with particular regard to the imposition of electric fields and field-aligned currents on the ionosphere. At high latitudes the imposed electric field from this source overcomes the field due to the rotation of the earth. The influence of the interplanetary magnetic field is described, as are the flow patterns that arise in the ionosphere. The effect of these electric fields on ionospheric plasma as well as on the neutral atmosphere is the topic of Chapter 9. In the final chapter, a number of processes that create structure in the high-latitude ionosphere are presented, including, but not limited to, the plasma instabilities that occur there. As is already evident, the D region and mesosphere are included in this new addition. Problems are added on the companion Web site to facilitate using the book as a textbook. A solutions manual is available to teachers. I am very much indebted to legions of students who have read and construc- tively criticized the text as it evolved, as well as to my many colleagues at Cornell and throughout the world. The study of space plasma physics is by definition an international discipline and epitomizes the way in which the human race can cooperate perfectly well at the highest technical and interpersonal levels. I have learned a great deal about both space physics and my fellow passengers on Spaceship Earth while traveling around to various rocket ranges, radar obser- vatories, and scientific laboratories. Special thanks go to Rod Heelis, who helped considerably with Chapters 7 and 8 in the first edition, and to my editor, Laurie Shelton, for her skill and endless patience. Michael C.

The chapter begins with historical comments and a description of the limitations we have set for the text. In particular, we do not repeat or significantly update the material published by Rishbeth and Garriott (1969) earlier in this same International Geo- physics Series. Rather, our emphasis is on electrodynamics and plasma physics, so we refer the interested reader to Rishbeth and Garriott and to Banks and Kockarts (1973) for more information about formation of the ionosphere, its ion chemistry, heat balance, and other aeronomic properties. Another and more recent resource for classical ionospheric science is the text by Schunk and Nagy (2000). Lyons and Williams (1984) have published a text on magnetospheric science. 1.1 Scope and Goals of the Text 1.1.1 Historical Perspective The earth’s ionosphere is a partially ionized gas that envelops the earth and in some sense forms the interface between the atmosphere and space. Since the gas is ionized, it cannot be fully described by the equations of neutral fluid dynamics. In fact, a major revolution in ionospheric physics has occurred in the past decades as the language and concepts of plasma physics have played an increasing role in the discipline. On the other hand, the number density of the neutral gas exceeds that of the ionospheric plasma, and certainly neutral particles cannot be ignored. A student of the ionosphere must thus be familiar with both classical fluid dynam- ics and plasma physics. Even a working knowledge of these two “pure” branches of physics, however, is not sufficient. Since the ionosphere lies at the interface between two very different and dynamic media, we must understand enough of both atmospheric dynamics and deep space plasma physics to understand how the ionosphere is formed and buffeted by sources from above and below. Added to these two is the requirement for a sufficient knowledge of ion and neutral chemistry and photochemistry to deal with production and loss processes.

The very discovery of the ionosphere came from radio wave observations and the recognition that only a reflecting layer composed of electrons and positive ions could explain the characteristics of the data. Most of the early work was aimed at explaining the various layers and their variability with local time, latitude, season, and so forth. The ionosonde, a remote sensing device that yields electron density profiles up to but not above the altitude of the highest concentration of charged particles, was the primary research tool. Such measurements revealed a bewildering variety of ionospheric behavior ranging from quiet, reproducible profiles to totally chaotic ones. Furthermore, a variety of periodic and aperiodic variations were observed, with time scales ranging from the order of the solar cycle (11 years) to just a few seconds. As time passed, the emphasis of ionospheric research shifted from questions dealing with formation and loss of plasma toward the dynamics and plasma physics of ionospheric phenomena. Ionospheric research has greatly benefited from the space program with the associated development of instruments for balloons, rockets, and satellites (see Appendix A 1 ). The combination of remote ionospheric sensing and direct in situ measurements made from spacecraft has accelerated the pace of ionospheric research. Equally important has been the development of plasma physics as a the- oretical framework around which to organize our understanding of ionospheric phenomena. Likewise, the continuing development of magnetospheric and atmo- spheric science has very much influenced our understanding of the ionosphere. In parallel with these developments, the incoherent scatter radar technique was devised (see Appendix A), and several large facilities were built to implement it. The primary advantage of this method was the ability to make quantitative measurements of numerous ionospheric parameters as a function of altitude at heights that were inaccessible to ground-based ionosondes. Since interpre- tation of the scattered signal requires detailed understanding of the interaction between the electrodynamic waves and thermal fluctuations in a plasma, a work- ing knowledge of plasma physics became necessary for understanding the diag- nostics as well as the science. Ionospheric science has thus evolved toward the point of view that is encom- passed by the term space plasma physics . The central theme of this book is the treatment of ionospheric physics within this context, but many other important issues are not discussed, including the topside ionosphere, seasonal behavior, heat balance, and global morphology. 1.1.2 Organization and Limitations As indicated in the previous section, our goal is to treat the electrodynamics and plasma physics of the ionosphere in some detail. We do not, therefore, have the 1 Appendices A and B are located on the book’s companion Web site at http://www.elsevierdirect. com/companions/9780120884254."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Introductory and Background Material 3 space to start from the first principles of ionospheric science, particularly with regard to photoproduction, ion chemistry, recombination, and related topics. In this first chapter, we attempt a broad general introduction to this area, which we hope will provide enough background to make the remainder of the text meaningful. It is also necessary to introduce elements of neutral atmospheric and mag- netospheric physics, since the ionosphere is very much affected by processes that originate in these two regions. The ionosphere coexists with the upper por- tion of the neutral atmosphere and receives considerable energy and momen- tum from the lower atmosphere as well as from the magnetosphere. The energy and momentum fluxes are carried by particles, electromagnetic fields, and atmo- spheric waves. We devote some time in this first chapter to a qualitative descrip- tion of the atmosphere and magnetosphere. Although useful as a starting point, the descriptive approach is not sufficient in all aspects, and we will treat some particularly important processes, such as gravity waves, in detail as they arise in the text. Some knowledge about experimental techniques is necessary for a student of ionospheric dynamics, if only to understand the sources of the data. Accordingly, Appendix A is included, describing some of the most important measurement methods. The choice of instruments so dealt with is not exhaustive and certainly reflects the bias and expertise of the author. Finally, we need to limit the scope of the text. We have somewhat regret- fully chosen not to include a detailed discussion of the acceleration of auro- ral particle beams. Part of the rationale for this decision concerns the height range where the electron acceleration usually takes place, some 2000 km or more above the earth’s surface, which is the limiting height range of the iono- sphere as we define it here. Thus, even though particle acceleration can and does occur much lower than the 2000 km height, we consider this topic to be outside the domain of this book, if not always outside the height range under detailed consideration. In Chapter 2 some basic equations and concepts are developed for use through- out the text. Some of these concepts would be quite useful as background for reading the rest of this first chapter, particularly the magnetospheric section. We thus recommend that a reader unfamiliar with the field read Chapter 1 twice, once for background and once again after reading Chapter 2. Chapters 3 and 4 deal with the electrodynamics and plasma physics of the equatorial iono- sphere. This region is singled out, since the earth’s horizontal magnetic field in that area leads to a number of unique phenomena. An interesting analogy exists with atmospheric and ocean dynamics. Since the Coriolis force vanishes at the equator, there are some unique phenomena common to both meteorology and oceanography that make equatorial dynamics very unusual and interesting. Chapters 5 and 6 deal with the tropical and midlatitude ionosphere, where the earth’s magnetic field has a sizable inclination but is not vertical and usually does not link the ionosphere with the hot, tenuous, flowing plasmas of the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"4 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics magnetosphere or solar wind. Here, a toroidal region of relatively cold, dense plasma, called the plasmasphere or protonosphere, exchanges plasma with the ionosphere. In the remainder of the text after Chapter 6, we study the high- latitude region. As previously mentioned, several experimental techniques are described in Appendix A. Appendix B provides formulas and tables that will help the reader describe ionospheric phenomena. Appendix B also defines vari- ous magnetic activity indices used in the text. 1.2 Structure of the Neutral Atmosphere and the Main Ionosphere Owing to the pervasive influence of gravity, the atmosphere and ionosphere are to first order horizontally stratified. Atmospheric structure can be neatly organized by a representative temperature profile, while the ionosphere is more sensibly organized by the number density of the plasma. Typical midlatitude profiles of temperature and plasma density are given in Fig. 1.1. The atmospheric tempera- ture initially decreases with altitude from the surface temperature, with a “lapse rate” of about 7 K / km in the troposphere. At about 10 km altitude this tempera- ture trend reverses (at the tropopause) and the stratosphere begins. This increase is due primarily to the absorption, by ozone, of part of the ultraviolet portion Mesosphere Thermosphere 1000 100 10 1 1000 100 Altitude (km) 10 1 Neutral gas Stratosphere Troposphere 0 400 800 1200 1600 Temperature (K) Plasma density (cm 2 3 ) 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 Altitude (km) D Region E Region Protonosphere Ionized gas Day Night F Region Figure 1.1 Typical profiles of neutral atmospheric temperature and ionospheric plasma density with the various layers designated."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Introductory and Background Material 5 of the solar radiation. This effect maximizes at 50 km, where the temperature trend again reverses at the stratopause. Radiative cooling creates a very sharp temperature decrease to a minimum in the range 130–190 K at about 90 km. For heights above the altitude of the temperature minimum (the mesopause), the temperature increases dramatically due to absorption of even higher energy solar photons to values that are quite variable but are often well above 1000 K. Not surprisingly, this region is termed the thermosphere. The atmosphere is rela- tively uniform in composition below about 100 km due to a variety of turbulent mixing phenomena. Above the “turbopause” the constituents begin to separate according to their various masses. The temperature increase in the thermosphere is explained by absorption of UV and EUV radiation from the sun. The EUV radiation is also responsible for the production of plasma in the sunlit hemisphere, since these solar photons have sufficient energy to ionize the neutral atmosphere. Equal numbers of positive ions and electrons are produced in this ionization process. One requirement for a gas to be termed a plasma is that it very nearly satisfies the requirement of charge neutrality, which in turn implies that the number density of ions, n i , must be nearly equal to the number density of electrons, n e . Experimenters who try to measure n i or n e usually label their results with the corresponding title, ion, or electron density. In this text, we shall usually refer to the plasma density n , where n ∼ = n i ∼ = n e is tacitly assumed to hold. Of course, if n i exactly equaled n e everywhere, there would be no electrostatic fields at all, which is not the case. A note on units is in order here. Rationalized mks units will be used except in cases where tradition is too firmly entrenched. For example, measuring number density per cubic centimeter is so common that we shall often use it rather than per cubic meter. Likewise, the mho and the mho per meter will be used for con- ductivity. Some further discussion of units and of various parameters of interest to ionospheric physics is included in Appendix B. Returning to Fig. 1.1, two plasma density profiles are given in the right-hand part of the figure, one typical of daytime midlatitude conditions and one typical of nighttime. In daytime, the solar spectrum is incident on a neutral atmosphere that is increasing exponentially in density with decreasing altitude. Since the pho- tons are absorbed in the process of photoionization, the beam itself decreases in intensity as it penetrates. The combination of decreasing solar flux, increasing neutral density, and diffusion provides a simple explanation for the basic large- scale vertical layer of ionization shown in Fig. 1.1. The peak plasma density occurs in the so-called F layer and attains values as high as 10 6 cm − 3 near noon- time. The factor that limits the peak density value is the recombination rate, the rate at which ions and electrons combine to form a neutral molecule or atom. This in turn very much depends on the type of ion that exists in the plasma and its corresponding interaction with the neutral gas. Some experimental data on the ion and neutral composition above 100 km are reproduced in Fig. 1.2.

Near 120 km the amount of atomic oxygen reaches that of O 2 , and above about 250 km the atomic oxygen density also exceeds that of N 2 . This trend is due to the photodissociation of O 2 by solar UV radiation coupled with molecular diffusion and the absence of turbulent mixing above the turbopause. The dominance of atomic oxygen in the neutrals is mirrored by the plasma composition. The curve labeled e − is similar to the right-hand side of Fig. 1.1 and represents the electron density (thus labeled with e − ) . Near the peak in the plasma density, the ions are nearly all O + , corresponding to the high concentration of atomic oxygen in the neutral gas. The altitude range 150–500 km is termed the F region, and the maximum density there is termed the F peak. (The F region is often separated into F1 and F2 during daytime due to the role of molecular ions.) Below the peak, NO + and O + 2 become more important, dominating the plasma below about 150 km. The altitude range 90–150 km is called the E region, and the ionization below 90 km is, not surprisingly, termed the D region. These rather pedantic names have a curious history. The E region received its name from the electric field in the radio wave reflected by the “Heavyside” layer (the first name for the ionosphere). The other layers were simply alphabetical extensions. It was assumed initially that a plasma is absent between the layers. Unfortunately, many phenomena have been named for the instrument used to measure them or some other obscure parameter. At the highest altitudes shown in Fig. 1.2, hydrogen becomes the dominant ion in a height regime referred to as the protonosphere. Helium ions are quite variable but sometimes reach 50% of the total ions at the base of the protonosphere. The"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Introductory and Background Material 7 hydrogen atom density is not shown in this early plot but exceeds helium above about 600 km. The hydrogen ions shown in Fig. 1.2 are produced by charge exchange with O + , O + + H → H + + O. Turning to the nighttime profile in Fig. 1.1, the plasma density near the F peak is reduced in magnitude but not nearly so drastically as is the density at the lower altitudes. With reference to Fig. 1.2, this difference mirrors the change in composition. That is, in lower altitude regions where molecular ions dominate, the density is sharply curtailed at night. The O + plasma density, on the other hand, is sustained through the night. This trend is dramatically illustrated in Fig. 1.3 by the series of plasma frequency ( f p ) profiles that were obtained by the incoherent scatter radar facility in Arecibo, Puerto Rico ( 18 . 5 ◦ N , 66 . 8 ◦ W ) . The electron plasma frequency (Hz) is related to the plasma density ( cm − 3 ) by the equation f p = 8980 √ n . The sunrise and sunset effects are very strong at the lower altitudes. This substantial difference in ion behavior is due to the fact that molecular ions have a much higher recombination rate with electrons than do atomic ions.

The former processes are called dissociative recombination, since the molecule ion breaks apart, while the latter is termed radiative recombination, since emission of a photon is required to conserve energy and momentum. The former two processes have a reaction rate much higher than the latter, which results in a much shorter lifetime for molecular ions than for atomic ions. Since the molecular ions are much shorter lived, when their production is curtailed at night, a recombination quickly reduces the plasma concentration. The O + plasma at higher altitudes, however, often survives the night at concentrations between 10 4 and 10 5 cm − 3 . The O + ions actually are lost through two-step processes (see Chapter 5) below the F peak. First, one of the following charge exchange reactions occurs: O + + O 2 → O + O + 2 O + + NO → NO + + O and then the dissociative reactions given above complete the recombination pro- cess. In addition, at night, plasma can flow back into the F region from the high altitude region called plasmasphere. The long-lived property of atomic ions also explains the numerous sharp layers of enhanced plasma density seen at low altitudes in Fig. 1.3. These contain heavy atomic ions such as Fe + and Mg + that are deposited by meteors in this height range. Just why they are gathered into sharp layers is discussed in some detail in Chapter 6, but once gathered, they last for a long time. Photoionization by solar radiation is not the only source of plasma in the ionosphere. Ionization by energetic particle impact on the neutral gas is particu- larly important at high latitudes. Visible light is also emitted when particles strike the atmosphere. These light emissions create the visible aurora. A view of the aurora looking down on the earth is offered in Fig. 1.4. The picture was taken on the Defense Meteorology Satellite Program (DMSP) satellite from about 800 km altitude and shows some of the complex structure and intricate detail that the auroral emission patterns can have. This complexity is mirrored in the ionization that also results from particle impact. The photograph shows how much this ionization can vary in space. Variability in time is illustrated in Fig. 1.5, where consecutive plasma density profiles taken 20 s apart are dis- played. The data were taken at the Chatanika Radar Observatory in Alaska ( 65 . 06 ◦ N , 147 . 39 ◦ W ) . Within the 40 s period, the E-region plasma density peak varied by almost one order of magnitude.

The typical energy of electrons in the nighttime aurora is 3–10 keV, and electron impact is the dominant ionization source. This energy range results in large plasma production in the E region, as shown in the profiles in Fig. 1.5. The production rates are more than 10 times those provided by noon- time photoionization in the E region. Lower-energy electrons can characterize the auroral precipitation pattern at other local times. These particles deposit their energy at higher altitudes, creating enhanced and highly variable F-region plasma concentrations. A more global view of the aurora is provided by the Dynamics Explorer-1 satellite imager, which has provided photographs looking down on the earth from an altitude of several thousand kilometers. The photo in Fig. 1.6 encom- passes the entire polar region and shows that the band of auroral light extends completely around the polar zone. The auroral emissions wax and wane in a complicated manner related to the rate of energy input from the solar wind, as well as to the storage and release rate of this energy in the earth’s magnetosphere and its ultimate release into the earth’s upper atmosphere and ionosphere.

The level of ionization is so low that the plasma physics is quite different from that of weakly collisional or collisionless plasmas, which captured the most attention of theorists. Furthermore, the region is too high for balloons and too low for satellites. Rockets often pass through it without even removing nosecones or windows. But as is usual in geophysics, as soon as better instruments were developed, interest rose steeply. In this section we discuss the basic source of the D region, which is fairly similar at equatorial and midlatitudes. We postpone discussion of its structure to future chapters. A summary of rocket electron density measurements is presented in Fig. 1.7a for quiet conditions and 1.7b for an active sun.

The largest difference between quiet and active solar con- ditions occurs between 65 and 75 km, where it exceeds an order of magnitude. The ion composition is presented in Fig. 1.8. Ion mass spectrometers have much lower height resolution than electron instruments, so the profiles are very smooth looking. Water cluster ions begin to form below 86 km in this case. At night, except for the metal sporadic ion layers discussed in Chapter 5, the D region virtually disappears, dropping to levels of 100–1000 cm − 3 all the way to the base of the F region, where O + has a long lifetime.

The ionization profile is very smooth, so the ledge effect can- not be explained by the source. The only other viable candidate is a height- dependent recombination effect. The processes are complex due to the many species involved (see Section 2.6). Although the D region ionization is low compared to the E and F regions, it does have a huge effect on radiowaves. This holds because radiowave absorp- tion is particularly high when even modest electron content exists at a height where the wave frequency equals the electron-ion ( ν en ) collision frequency.

FM radio and TV are much higher frequency and almost entirely pass through the whole system into space. The ionization rates of various high-energy photons and particles are plotted in Fig. 1.9. These rates correspond to the P j in (2.7). Table 1.1 provides some of the important reactions. Ignoring transport, three continuity equations must be considered, all of the form, ∂ n j ∂ t = P j − L j where j is electrons, negative ions, or positive ions. At the time these coupled equations were first solved, reaction 2 in Table 1.1 was not well understood. But to create the ledge visible in all the rocket profiles in Figs. 1.7a and 1.7b, Reid (1970) needed the high effective rate of recombination plotted in Fig. 1.10. He concluded that such a high rate required the existence of water cluster ions in the 75–85 km height range, which were found later by Narcisi et al. (1972), as illustrated in Figure 1.8. Notice that the rate for reaction 2 is nearly 100 times that of reaction 1. A strong variation of α d with altitude shown in Fig. 1.10 is caused by the change in the cluster-ion composition. Below 75 km, reaction 3 becomes important.

This offset, which is com- mon to several planetary magnetic fields, is presently such that the dipole axis in the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the North American continent. The magnetic field B points down toward the surface of the earth in the Northern hemisphere and away from it in the Southern hemisphere. The dipole position wanders with time, and paleomagnetic studies show that it flips over with irreg- ular time differences. The field is created by currents in the molten, electrically conducting core of the earth, currents that are in turn driven by thermal con- vection in the core. This convection is certainly quite complex, but the magnetic field contributions that are of higher order than the dipole term fall off faster with distance, leaving the dipole term dominant at the surface. Some useful equations for a dipole field are gathered in Appendix B. The field at the earth’s surface varies from about 0 . 25 × 10 − 4 tesla (0.25 gauss) near the magnetic equator to about 0 . 6 × 10 − 4 tesla near the poles. Sketches of magnetic field lines are useful when considering the ionosphere and magnetosphere, since plasma particles move very freely along field lines. A dipole field is sketched in Fig. 1.11. The equation for the magnetic field lines can be written in a modified spherical coordinate system as r = L cos 2 θ N S Figure 1.11 Sketch of dipole magnetic field lines extending into a vacuum."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Introductory and Background Material 17 where r is measured in units of earth radii ( R e = 6371 km ) , θ is the magnetic latitude, and L is the radius of the equatorial crossing point of the field line (also measured in earth radii). A field line that crosses the equatorial plane at L = 4 thus exits the earth’s surface ( r = 1 ) at a magnetic latitude of 60 ◦ . Owing to the dipole tilt, this field line is located at about 49 ◦ geographic latitude in the North American sector and about 71 ◦ geographic latitude in the Euro-Asian region. As indicated in Fig. 1.11, if the earth were surrounded by a vacuum with no external sources of electrical currents, the dipole field lines would extend in loops of ever increasing dimension with the magnitude of B decreasing as 1 / r 3 . The earth is, however, immersed in the atmosphere of the sun. Like the earth’s thermosphere, the upper atmosphere of the sun is very hot, so hot that the hydro- gen and helium can escape gravitational attraction and form a steadily streaming outflow of material called the solar wind. Because of its high temperature and constant illumination by the sun, the solar wind is a fully ionized plasma (unlike the ionosphere, which contains more neutral particles than plasma). One sur- prising feature of the solar wind is that it is supersonic. Simply heating a gas cannot create supersonic flow, but a combination of heating, compression, and subsequent expansion can create this condition, as it does, for example, in a rocket exhaust nozzle. In the solar wind case, the solar gravitational field acts analogously to the rocket nozzle, and the solar wind becomes supersonic above a few solar radii. The sun has a very complex surface magnetic field created by con- vective flow of the electrically conducting solar material. Sunspots, in particular, have associated high magnetic fields. The expanding wind drags the solar mag- netic field outward, with the result that the earth’s magnetic field is continually bathed in a hot, magnetized, supersonic, collisionless plasma capable of conduct- ing electrical current and carrying a large amount of kinetic and electrical energy. The solar wind is a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator, and some of the solar wind energy flowing by the earth finds its way into the ionosphere and the upper atmosphere. There it powers the aurora, creates magnetic storms and substorms that affect power grids and communication systems, heats the polar upper atmosphere, drives large neutral atmospheric winds, energizes much of the plasma on the earth’s magnetic field lines, and creates a vast circulating system of hot plasma in and around the earth’s nearby space environment. We cannot come close to exploring these topics in detail, but we need a framework about which to organize the ionospheric effects of these phenomena. Suppose we first ignore the supersonic nature of the solar wind as well as the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and surround the earth and its magnetic field with a subsonic, streaming plasma. The magnetic force on a particle of charge q moving at velocity V is F = q V × B (1.1) As illustrated in Fig. 1.12, and because of the polarity of the earth’s field, this force will deflect solar wind ions to the right and electrons to the left as they"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"18 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Dawn Dusk Ecliptic plane e 2 Solar wind ion-Electron pair Solar wind Earth’s magnetic field (out of paper) D i r e c t i o n o f c u r r e n t H 1 Figure 1.12 Schematic diagram showing deflection of solar wind particles by the earth’s magnetic field. The view is in the ecliptic plane. approach the earth. Once deflected, they will spiral around the magnetic field lines and drift around the earth. Since the magnetic field strength increases as the plasma approaches the earth, a distance is eventually reached where the force is sufficient to keep the particles from penetrating any farther, and they flow around the obstacle. Notice that since ions are deflected toward dusk and elec- trons toward dawn, a net duskward current exists in a thin sheet (extending also out of the plane of the diagram) where the force balance occurs. The secondary magnetic field generated by this current sheet is parallel to the earth’s field in the region between the earth and the current sheet and is antiparallel to the earth’s magnetic field in the solar wind. This magnetic field cancels the earth’s field on the sunward side of the boundary and increases the value of the magnetic field inside the current sheet. If this were the entire interaction, the resulting configu- ration of flow and field would look something like the sketch in Fig. 1.13a. The volume inside the elongated region is termed the magnetosphere—the region dominated by the earth’s magnetic field. Experiments show that the magneto- sphere is indeed terminated by a very sharp boundary on the sunward side, which is called the magnetopause, but is very much more elongated in the antisunward direction than the sketch shows.

The bow shock wave and internal flow pattern are sketched in (b). access to particles from the solar wind and all of the magnetic field lines in the magnetosphere have two ends on the earth. The sketch in Fig. 1.13b shows the complication that arises when the solar wind is supersonic. A shock wave must form, across which the solar wind density and temperature rise abruptly. The solar wind velocity decreases, allowing for subsonic flow around the obstacle. The sketch in Fig. 1.13b also shows that a “closed” magnetosphere need not be static even though particles cannot readily enter. A “viscous” interaction may occur (Axford and Hines, 1961) in which plasma inside and near the flanks of the magnetosphere is weakly coupled to the solar wind flow, possibly by waves that propagate across the boundary. Some magnetospheric plasma is then dragged along in the antisunward direction, and because of the resulting pres- sure buildup in the nightside of the magnetosphere, there must be a flow back toward the sun in the center of the magnetosphere. The circulation that results (sketched in Fig. 1.13b) is in good qualitative agreement with observations but is now thought to be less important than the magnetospheric flow driven by a process termed “reconnection,” which involves the interplanetary magnetic field and results in a partially open magnetosphere. This process is described next. Before discussing reconnection, we must point out that both the single-particle dynamic and magnetofluid dynamic viewpoints discussed in Chapter 2 are such that the relationships V ⊥ = E × B / B 2 (1.2a) and E ⊥ =− V × B (1.2b)"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"20 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics hold in a tenuous, magnetized plasma, where E is the electric field in the plasma, V is its flow velocity, and the subscript ⊥ indicates the component perpendicular to B (Chen, 1984). These two expressions are, in fact, equivalent, since taking the cross product of (1.2b) with B and dividing by B 2 yields (1.2a). For our present purposes we accept these expressions as accurate relationships between E ⊥ and V ⊥ . In the direction parallel to B , charged particles move very freely. This means that magnetic field lines usually act like perfect electrical conduc- tors, transmitting perpendicular electric fields and voltages across vast distances with no change in the potential in the direction parallel to B . Thus, any flowing magnetized plasma can act as a source of voltage if there is a component of V perpendicular to B . These electrical properties become very important factors in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere, once we include the interplane- tary magnetic field in our solar wind model. Schematic views of the solar magnetic field are given in Figs. 1.14 and 1.15. As the solar wind expands, the magnetic field is stretched into a disklike geometry that has flutes much like a ballerina’s skirt. Consideration of the Maxwell equation ∇× B = μ 0 J shows that a geometry with adjacent magnetic fields that are antiparallel must have a current sheet separating them (indicated by the crosshatched surface in Fig. 1.14). The entire pattern rotates with the 27-day rotation period of the sun. As the pattern rotates past the earth, the position of the current sheet is alternately above and below the ecliptic plane. As illustrated in Fig. 1.15, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) can be considered approximately as a series of spirals emanating from the sun. Near the earth the magnetic field in the spiral is directed toward or away from the sun depending on whether the current sheet is above or below the plane. In addition, the inclination of the current sheet with respect to the ecliptic plane produces a northward or southward component of the IMF relative to an axis normal to the plane. Considerable small-scale turbulence structure exists in both the solar wind velocity and magnetic fields, and the interplanetary medium is also greatly affected by shock waves and solar flares. Taken together, these properties of the solar wind result in a highly variable buffeting of the earth’s magnetosphere. It is customary to specify the solar wind parameters in terms of three mutually perpendicular components with respect to fixed axes. In these geocentric solar ecliptic (GSE) coordinates, the x -axis points from the center of the earth to the sun, while the z -axis is positive parallel to the earth’s spin axis (to the north) and is perpendicular to the ecliptic plane. The y -axis makes the third mutually perpendicular right-handed system. Figure 1.15 shows the situation looking in the negative z direction down onto the ecliptic plane.

We now briefly describe the interplanetary electric field. To first order the solar wind blows radially outward from the sun, so that in the ecliptic plane V sw =−| V sw | a x In a reference frame fixed to the earth, there will be an electric field given by E sw =− V sw × B sw This will generate a potential difference across the earth’s magnetosphere given by V m =− E sw · L a y where L is the effective size of the magnetosphere perpendicular to V sw . Note that when B sw has a positive z component, E sw has a dusk-to-dawn direction (negative y component). When B sw has a negative z component, the interplanetary electric field is in the dawn-to-dusk direction across the earth. For typical values of V sw = 500 km / s and B sw z = 5 × 10 − 9 tesla, E sw y = 2 . 5mV / m. Integrating this electric field across the front of the magnetosphere, which is roughly a distance L = 20 R e across (where R e stands for earth radii), yields an available potential difference of the order of 300,000 volts. The magnitude of this voltage and its polarity fluctuate along with the parameters V sw and B sw z . The earth is thus immersed in a magnetohydrodynamic electrical generator capable of hundreds of kilovolts of potential. We now turn to the problem of getting this energy into the magnetosphere. Continuing our analogy with an MHD electrical generator, we need to tap this power by closing the electrical circuit associated with the solar wind- magnetosphere interaction. This is accomplished by the connection of magnetic field lines attached to the earth with those in the interplanetary medium. Cur- rent can then flow down into the magnetosphere and close the circuit through the conducting ionosphere. Since the magnetic field lines are equipotentials, the interplanetary electric field maps into the near-space region of the earth, into the ionosphere, and even deep into the stratosphere. This “connection” can occur most easily when the IMF is southward, as illus- trated in Fig. 1.16, where the cross-sectional view is now in the noon-midnight plane. This viewpoint was first suggested by Dungey (1961).

The Northern and Southern Hemispheric field lines are stretched into a mag- netic tail and eventually reconnect with each other deep in the antisunward region. We spend considerable time in Chapter 8 discussing the electric field and associated E × B / B 2 circulation patterns that arise in the magnetosphere for various solar wind configurations. In the “ B z south” case shown here, the inter- planetary dawn-dusk electric field shown at the top of the sketch maps directly into the polar ionosphere along the connected magnetic field lines. There, the electric field E I is “out of the paper” and the E × B drift is antisunward. Once reconnection occurs in the tail, the forces associated with the stretched magnetic field lines bring the plasma rapidly back toward the earth. This is called the region of sunward convection. A cutaway view of the magnetosphere is given in Fig. 1.17, with the location of various regions and phenomena indicated. When the interplanetary magnetic field connects to the earth’s magnetic field, it produces open field lines with only one foot on the earth. These field lines extend far into the magnetotail and form the northern and southern tail lobes. These open field lines also cross the mag- netopause, where they connect to the interplanetary field in the magnetosheath. In so doing, they come into contact with plasma populations just inside the magnetopause, which are called the boundary layer and the mantle. The field lines that reach down the magnetotail have opposite directions on the northern and southern sides of the equatorial plane, and a current sheet must exist to separate the northern and southern tail lobes. This so-called neutral sheet where | B | ∼ = 0 is also the region in which open field lines may reconnect to form closed"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"24 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics M a gneto s he a th A u ror a l ov a l Pl as m as phere R a di a tion belt region R a di a tion belt region Bow s hock Bow s hock S ol a r wind pl as m a D a y s ide bo u nd a ry l a yer (entry l a yer) Interpl a net a ry medi u m M a ntle C us p M a gneto s he a th M a gnetop aus e Northern t a il lobe Geom a gnetic field line s A u ror a l precipit a tion Pl as m a s heet Ring c u rrent T a il bo u nd a ry l a yer M a gnetot a il Ne u tr a l s heet S o u thern t a il lobe Field- a ligned c u rrent s Figure 1.17 Schematic representation of the magnetosphere.

As the hot plasma sheet flows toward the earth into an increasing magnetic field, the differential motion of the ions and electrons produces a ring current somewhat analogous to the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere itself on the sunward side of the earth. Some of these hot plasma sheet particles move along the magnetic field lines and precipitate into the atmosphere in a ring around the polar regions called the auroral oval. This ring forms the light pattern seen in Fig. 1.6. Most of the solar wind and magnetospheric effects occur at high latitudes, although many interesting phenomena do extend to lower latitudes during active times. The active region is skewed in the antisunward direction, extending to 70 ◦ mag- netic latitude on the sunward side and 60 ◦ on the nightside. In this text, some of the phenomena indicated in Fig. 1.17 will be treated in detail and others in a more sketchy fashion. The interested reader is referred to the text by Lyons and Williams (1984) and Kivelson and Russell (1995) for more complete treatises on magnetospheric processes. Particle energization processes will not be discussed quantitatively at all in this text, but a brief sketch is in order here. Solar wind electrons have thermal and flow energies of only a few electron volts, while the bulk flow energy of the ions is about a kilovolt. The earth’s bow shock wave, shown in Fig. 1.17, energizes the electrons to many tens or even hundreds of electron volts in the magnetosheath. Some of these hot electrons and ions directly penetrate into the ionosphere in the connection process or through the cusp in the magnetic field geometry. This precipitation of energetic particles contributes to the dayside part"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Introductory and Background Material 25 of the auroral oval. As the magnetic field lines reconnect in the tail and jet back toward the earth, the average electron energy is boosted to about a kilovolt in the region termed the plasma sheet. The plasma in this region provides a source of steady precipitation that corresponds visually to the widespread emissions called diffuse aurora. This precipitation also acts as an ionization source for the ionosphere. The hot flowing plasma has an associated electric field [see (1.2b)] that is impressed on the ionosphere. Electrical currents flow in response to this electric field. For nighttime conditions the precipitating plasma itself provides most of the conductivity, so an electrical feedback can develop between the plasma sheet and the ionosphere as currents flow back and forth between them. This feedback is most complex in the region of the discrete aurora, which contains the very bright, active, auroral displays. Here, at some point along the magnetic field (usually above 3000 km), electric fields develop parallel to the magnetic field lines that accelerate electrons down into the atmosphere and ions out into the magnetosphere. Typical field-aligned potential drops associated with this parallel electric field range from 100 V to 10 kV. The electron density in the ionospheric E region can exceed 10 6 cm − 3 below a strong auroral display (see Fig. 1.5), and the horizontal electrical current in the ionosphere can create perturbations in the surface magnetic field of up to 3000 nanotesla—nearly 5% of the earth’s surface field at high latitudes. Many other acceleration processes besides parallel electric fields operate in the magnetosphere and are beyond our scope to discuss in detail. References Axford, W. I., and Hines, C. O. (1961).

At all heights of interest in the study of ionospheric phenomena, the neutral gas density exceeds that of the plasma. In fact, the plasma density does not become comparable to that of the neutrals until several thousand kilometers in altitude. The primary difference between ionospheric plasma dynamics and thermospheric neutral gas dynamics is the effect of electromagnetic forces. The various forces acting on charged parti- cles drive electric currents that in turn create electric fields that modify the plasma dynamics. The electrical conductivity of the medium is thus extremely important and is derived in this chapter. We discuss briefly the generation of electric fields in the ionosphere and the transmission of electric fields along magnetic field lines between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere. At middle and low latitudes, the electric field is generated primarily by the neutral wind field. In later chapters electric fields impressed on the ionosphere by solar wind and magnetospheric processes will be taken into account, as will their occasional penetration into the middle- and low-latitude sectors. In the analysis that follows, we first obtain the equations for a neutral fluid and then extend them to ionized gases. Finally, we develop the equations needed to describe collisionless plasmas in the absence of a neutral fluid, which is the appropriate approximation for the magnetosphere. Although not the primary topic of this text, such a development is necessary, since we must be able to describe certain key magnetospheric phenomena in some detail. 2.1 The Basic Fluid Equations The ions, electrons, and neutrals can be considered as three interpenetrating flu- ids coupled by collisions and, in the case of ions and electrons, their self-generated electric and magnetic fields. The gas of ions and electrons, taken together, is often referred to as a plasma in the text. As usual in a fluid description, we assume that an element small enough to be treated as a differential volume in the math- ematical sense still contains a sufficient number of atoms, ions, electrons, and/or The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Copyright © 2009 by Academic Press, Inc.

Such a volume element is macroscopically small, even though microscopically it contains many particles colliding in a random fashion. We use this approach almost exclusively in the text. Schunk and Nagy (2000) discuss this and other approximations for tenuous fluid behaviors. 2.1.1 Conservation of Mass Conservation of mass dictates that the flux of material into or out of a volume through its surface must be equal to the rate of increase or decrease of mass inside the volume. The mathematical statement in integral form relates the mass density ρ and the fluid velocity U through \u0002\u0002\u0002 v ∂ρ/∂ tdV =− \u0002\u0002 \u0004 ρ U · d a (2.1) where the surface \u0004 encloses the volume V , and d a is normal to the surface and directed outward. The differential form of (2.1) can be derived from Gauss’s theorem, which relates the surface integral on the right-hand side to a volume integral of the divergence of ρ U —that is, \u0002\u0002\u0002 v ∂ρ/∂ tdV =− \u0002\u0002 \u0004 ρ U · d a =− \u0002\u0002\u0002 v ∇· (ρ U ) dV and thus, ∂ρ/∂ t =−∇· (ρ U ) (2.2) This constitutes the continuity equation for the neutral atmosphere with mass density ρ and velocity U . Expanding the divergence operator, (2.2) can also be written ∂ρ/∂ t + U ·∇ ρ + ρ( ∇· U ) = 0 (2.3) or, equivalently, d ρ/ dt + ρ ( ∇· U ) = 0 (2.4) where the total time derivative d / dt = ∂/∂ t + U ·∇ (2.5)"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 29 has been used. This operation yields the time rate of change of a quantity— ρ in this case—moving with the flow. Equation (2.4) states that the rate of change of ρ moving with the flow is determined only by the divergence of the velocity field. For an incompressible fluid the mass density of a parcel cannot change as it moves ( d ρ/ dt = 0), and so from (2.4) it follows that ∇· U = 0. In an incompressible fluid the velocity field is divergence free. The advective derivative ( U ·∇ ) in (2.5) is important, since it describes the temporal variation of a quantity, at a point in space, due to the transport of that quantity into the region. For example, in the case of incompressible flow, the mass density can only change with time at a fixed point in space via this term, since ∂ρ/∂ t =− ( U ·∇ ρ) (2.6) In the case of a partially ionized medium, ion and electron pairs may be pro- duced by impact of a photon or energetic particle or lost through recombination between positively and negatively charged particles. These processes are very important for the ionospheric plasma. If P j denotes the rate of production of ions (and electrons) per cubic meter per second and L j is the rate of loss, then the mass conservation equation for each of the ionized species is ∂ρ j /∂ t +∇· \u0003 ρ j V j \u0004 = \u0003 P j − L j \u0004 M j (2.7) where M j is the mass of each species. Notice that we use the notation V j to represent the velocity of the charged species, reserving U for the velocity of the neutral gas. Since electric charge is a conserved quantity, it must be the case that the total number of electrons (e) gained or lost equals the sum of all the different types of ions gained or lost—that is, N \u0004 j = 1 \u0003 P j − L j \u0004 = P e − L e We ignore negative ions because their formation is unimportant above about 80 km altitude. Because the number density of the neutral gas far exceeds that of the ion and electron gas for heights below several thousand kilometers, we can ignore the loss of neutral particles when ion-electron pairs are formed. Fur- thermore, if we are not interested in the possible neutral mass density changes due to composition changes of the neutrals (e.g., formation of atomic oxygen by photodissociation), we may use (2.2) for the neutral atmosphere, while for the ionized particles we need (2.7).

EUV radiation is absorbed at high altitudes, both heating and ionizing the E and F regions. X-rays penetrated quite deeply and, along with Lyman α (ionizing NO), control the D region ion densities. UV is absorbed by ozone, creating the temperature rise in the stratosphere. 2.1.2 Equation of State For an ideal gas, the mass density and pressure, p j , are related by p j = ρ j k B T j / M j = n j k B T j (2.8) This is the equation of state for each of the fluids we consider (ions, electrons, neutrals), and we relate the mass density ρ j to the number density n j through ρ j = n j M j . In this text we use k B to represent Boltzmann’s constant. The letter k used alone or with any other subscript represents a wave number. 2.1.3 Momentum Equation for the Neutral Fluid The continuity equations and the equation of state must be supplemented by a dynamical equation relating the fluid velocity to the forces acting on the fluid. This is derived from the principle of conservation of momentum, which requires that the change of momentum per unit time within a volume be equal to the pressure gradient force and the total external force field F acting on the material inside the volume plus the momentum flux carried across the surface bound- ing the volume by viscosity, advection, or wave flux. We first treat the neu- tral gas. Here, as in most ionospheric and upper atmospheric studies, the wind direction is indicated by where the wind is going—in other words, an eastward wind is a wind toward the east. (In meteorology an easterly wind comes from the east.) Advection of a vector quantity such as momentum across a boundary by flow is conceptually no more difficult than previously discussed for the scalar mass density. However, the mathematical description is more complex and is most readily accomplished by the use of tensor notation as employed here. The equation equivalent to (2.1) for the time rate of momentum change in a volume is \u0002\u0002\u0002 V ∂ ∂ t (ρ U ) dV = \u0002\u0002\u0002 V \u0003 −∇ p \u0004 dV + \u0002\u0002\u0002 V F dV − \u0002\u0002 \u0004 π m · d a − \u0002\u0002 \u0004 π w · d a (2.9)"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"32 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics where F is the external force, p the pressure, π m the momentum flux density tensor due to material motions, and π w the momentum flux density tensor due to waves in the medium.

The external force F can be of many different types, which will be treated as they arise in the text. To understand the material momentum tensor, consider a single particle of mass m moving at velocity v . The momentum, m v , is carried along by the velocity v , resulting in a momentum flux tensor given by π m = v m v Written as a 3 × 3 matrix, this becomes (π m ) jk = m υ j υ k An analogous form for a fluid of mass density ρ characterized by a mean flow velocity U is given by (π m ) jk = ρ U j U k (2.11) This part of the momentum flux tensor describes how momentum is transferred within a fluid by the motion of the fluid. If there is any net divergence of this momentum flux, a net force will occur as indicated in (2.10). The divergence of a tensor is a vector and may be written ( ∇· π ) j = \u0004 k ∂π jk ∂ x k where x k is the k th Cartesian coordinate.

Consider the situation illustrated in Fig. 2.2, where the x component of the mean fluid velocity increases in the z direction. Par- ticles randomly crossing the plane z = z 0 from above that collide with particles below will, on average, contribute more x momentum to the fluid below z = z 0 than particles crossing in the other direction will contribute above. This momen- tum transfer results in forces on the fluid such that the velocity gradient in this directionisreduced.Unlikethemomentumfluxdescribedby(2.11),this“viscous” force depends on collisions and is a dissipative process. Energy in the mean flow is converted into heat when viscosity is important. The exact form of the viscous momentum flux density tensor is quite complicated, and we refer the reader to a discussion by Landau and Lifshitz (1959) for details. In its simplest form, the momentum flux density depends on the first derivatives of the velocity with two associatedproportionalityconstants η and η \u0003 .Whenthedivergenceofthemomen- tum flux tensor is taken, as required by (2.10), the viscous force F v is given by F v = η ∇ 2 U + η \u0003 ∇ ( ∇· U ) (2.12) For incompressible flow ( ∇· U ) = 0 and (2.12) reduces to the more familiar form F v = η ∇ 2 U (2.13) where η is called the dynamic viscosity coefficient.

Notice that the Laplacian oper- ator in (2.15) acts on each velocity component. That is, the x component of the viscous force is given by ( F v ) x = η ∂ 2 u ∂ x 2 For large-scale flow patterns ∇· U = 0 is a good approximation, and (2.13) is used almost exclusively for viscous forces. We must note, however, that in the lower atmosphere, the coefficient η is determined not by molecular collisions but by the interaction between eddies in the flow. In other words, the effective viscosity coefficient is much larger than the molecular coefficient calculated from kinetic theory. Above the turbopause (near 100 km), where turbulent mixing ceases, the classical molecular viscosity coefficient is appropriate. We now consider the forces that can contribute to the external force F in (2.15). The body force F includes the important gravitational term ρ g . Another important body force for ionized species is due to electromagnetic effects. As is well known, when a current I passes through a wire in a magnetic field, the elec- tromagnetic I × B force is transferred from the charged particles to the material in the wire. In continuous media the force density equivalent to this force is given by J × B , F EM = J × B (2.16) This force density transfers electromagnetic energy to kinetic energy, accelerating or decelerating the fluid. The upward flux of momentum π w due to waves can be very important in the upper atmosphere. Waves from the dense lower regions tend to grow in ampli- tude as they propagate upward, since the mass density decreases exponentially with altitude. If the waves are absorbed at any given height, then ( ∇· π w ) \u0004= 0 and the local atmosphere will be accelerated. Ocean swimmers often experience a phenomenon of this type when water waves break on the beach at an angle that is not exactly perpendicular to the shoreline. Some of the wave momentum is absorbed in the surf region, and a “long-shore” current results. This current transports sand (and people) along the coast and is an important factor in the formation, structure, and location of beaches. This would complete the momentum equation for the neutrals except for the fact that the earth is rotating. Newton’s laws as expressed in (2.15) refer to a frame of reference at rest or one moving with constant linear velocity. In a reference frame ( R ) rotating with constant angular velocity \t , the time rate of change of a vector is related to the time derivative in an inertial frame (I) by \u0003 d A / dt \u0004 I = \u0003 d A / dt \u0004 R + \t × A (2.17)"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 35 An excellent discussion of this result is given by Goldstein (1950). In the rotating frame where we live and take measurements, the time derivative of the velocity in (2.15) must thus be replaced by \u0003 d U I / dt \u0004 I = \u0003 d U I / dt \u0004 R + \t × U I (2.18) We have included a subscript on the velocity vector to show specifically that even though we now have the proper time derivative in the rotating frame, the vector U I is still the velocity in inertial space. Since the goal is to describe dynamics totally in the rotating coordinates, U I must be expressed in that frame also. Viewed from inertial space, an object moving on the earth’s surface with velocity U R has an additional velocity \t × r , where r is the position vector drawn from the center of the earth—that is, U I = U R + \t × r (2.19) Since \t is constant, the time derivative of (2.19) in the inertial frame is \u0003 d U I / dt \u0004 I = \u0003 d U R / dt \u0004 I + \t × \u0003 d r / dt \u0004 I Now each of the derivatives on the right-hand side must be replaced by the operation (2.18) in order to have the expression given entirely by quantities measured in the rotating coordinates, and, thus, \u0003 d U I / dt \u0004 I = \u0003 d U R / dt \u0004 R + \t × U R + \t × \u0007\u0003 d r / dt \u0004 R + \t × r \b For a parcel of fluid moving across the surface, \u0003 d r / dt \u0004 R = U R , so we have \u0003 d U I / dt \u0004 I = \u0003 d U R / dt \u0004 R + 2 \t × U R + \t × ( \t × r ) The second term is known as the Coriolis force. The last term is equal to r \t 2 cos θ , where θ is the latitude and has components both radially inward and equator- ward. This term may be combined with g to describe an effective gravitational field. We will use the symbol g for these combined terms and move the Coriolis term to the right-hand side of (2.15), which yields the following equation of motion of the neutral atmosphere in a rotating frame: ρ d U / dt =−∇ p + ρ g + η ∇ 2 U −∇· π w − 2 ρ(\t × U ) + J × B (2.20) 2.1.4 Momentum Equations for the Plasma In Section 2.1.3 the only effect of a coexisting plasma embedded in the neutral atmosphere was the J × B force transferred to the neutrals. We now explore the fluid equations for the plasma species."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"36 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Each species will have its own momentum equation. Although neutral fluid dynamics on a rotating object such as the earth is strongly affected by the Coriolis force, this velocity-dependent force has little importance in geophysical plasma analysis, since the magnetic force (which is also velocity dependent) is much greater. The important body forces that do act on the ionospheric plasma and that we include in the force F are as follows: Gravitational: ρ j g Electric: n j q j E Magnetic: n j q j ( V j × B ) where q j is the charge of the j th species and E and B are the electric and magnetic fields. In addition, a frictional force is exerted on each species by collisions with all of the other species. For example, electrons will collide with neutrals as well as with the various ions. The force is proportional to the respective collision frequency and to the differential velocity between the particular fluid and the other fluids. The frictional force on each species may be written F j =− \u0004 k j \u0004= k ρ j v jk \u0003 V j − V k \u0004 The v jk are momentum transfer collision frequencies with units of s − 1 .We leave any detailed discussion of the v jk coefficients for other texts such as Banks and Kockarts (1973) and Schunk and Nagy (2000).

This is equivalent to treating temperature profiles as given quantities. In this book we do not attempt to include a thermal analysis. (We refer the reader to the text by Schunk and Nagy, 2002.) This simplification would be very poor if our main interest was thermospheric neutral gas dynamics or the topside ionosphere. However, many interesting phenomena may be studied without including temperature changes self-consistently. To treat the electric and magnetic fields, Maxwell’s electrodynamic equations are needed, which, in their full form, are given by ∇× E =− ∂ B /∂ t (2.23a) ∇· E = ρ c /ε 0 (2.23b) ∇× B = μ 0 \u0003 J + ε 0 ∂ E /∂ t \u0004 (2.23c) ∇· B = 0 (2.23d) where ρ c is the charge density ( ρ c = \u0004 j n j q j ) and J is the current density ( J = \u0004 j n j q j V j ). To this must be added the principle of conservation of charge ∂ ∂ t \u0002\u0002\u0002 v ρ c dV =− \u0002\u0002 S J · d a This equation states that the buildup or decay of charge inside a volume V is determined by the net electric conduction current across the surface \u0004 . Note the similarity to (2.1) for the conservation of mass. In differential form this may be written ∇· J =− ∂ρ c /∂ t (2.24) Neither production nor recombination affects this equation because the net charge does not change in either process. In the ionosphere the conduction current is larger than the vacuum displacement current ε 0 ∂ E /∂ t in (2.23c) for all wave frequencies of interest here, and the displacement current is there- fore dropped. Furthermore, since the largest changes in the magnetic field at"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics ionospheric heights are such that δ B / B ≤ 5%, we take (2.23c) as a diagnostic equation only. That is, given some current J , we can find δ B , the perturbation to the geomagnetic field, from (2.23c), but the B we use in the rest of the dynamical equations is the earth’s field, so we can take ∂ B /∂ t = 0. This approximation thus rules out induced electric fields from magnetic field changes. Of course, when we include electromagnetic waves such as Alfvén waves, we include both electric and magnetic field fluctuations. We are thus left with the set ∇× E = 0 (2.25a) ∇· E = ρ c /ε 0 (2.25b) ∇× B = μ 0 J (2.25c) ∇· B = 0 (2.25d) ∇· J =− ∂ρ c /∂ t (2.25e) Equation (2.25a) shows that the electric field is derivable from a potential func- tion φ( r , t ) through E =−∇ φ . Finally, one further important simplification is possible. In an ionized medium, very small charge differences create large electric fields. Thus, a plasma must exhibit nearly perfect charge neutrality. This implies ∇· J =− ∂ρ c /∂ t ∼ = 0 (2.26) That is, the divergence of the electric current on any macroscopic time scale must be zero. As we shall see in Section 2.4, in most cases we use ∇· J = 0 to calculate the electric field rather than (2.25b). Poisson’s equation [i.e., (2.25b)] is, of course, still valid, but it is not very useful, since the charge difference associated with geophysically important electric fields is very small. This situation is similar to the problem of calculating the vertical velocity in atmospheric dynamics. The vertical component of the momentum equation is not very useful, since the vertical pressure gradient and the gravitational terms nearly cancel each other out. In practice, the vertical velocity is often found from the divergence of the horizontal wind, much as we use ∇· J = 0 to find the electric field. The following combined set of dynamic and electrodynamic equations for the plasma (plus the equation of state) remains after these simplifications: ρ j d V j / dt =−∇ p j + ρ j g + q j ρ j M j \u0003 E + V j × B \u0004 − \u0004 k j \u0004= k ρ j v jk \u0003 V j − V k \u0004 (2.27a) ∂ρ j ∂ t +∇· \u0003 ρ j V j \u0004 = \u0003 P j − L j \u0004 M j (2.27b) p j = ρ j k B T j / M j = n j k B T j (2.27c)"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 39 E =−∇ φ (2.27d) ∇· J = 0 =∇· B (2.27e) ∇× B = μ 0 J (2.27f) Note that from (2.26) we have the important result that the number of electrons per unit volume must be almost equal to the number of positive ions of all types n e ∼ = \u0004 ions n j This means we can define a plasma density n , which is equal to both n e n e and \u0004 j n j . 2.2 Steady-State Ionospheric Plasma Motions Due to Applied Forces In this section we start with (2.27a) and derive the equations that determine the electrodynamic response of a partially ionized plasma to applied steady forces. For the present we specify the distribution of plasma density and the wind field. Considering (2.27a), with the plasma pressure distribution specified, we can argue that the response of the plasma constituents to changing forces occurs very quickly (i.e., d V j / dt ≈ 0). This can be seen by comparing the terms in (2.27a) that include the velocity. The acceleration terms on the left-hand side are of order V j /τ and, V 2 j / L , where τ is the response time to a new set of forces and L is a distance scale for velocity change. The Lorentz term (the third term on the right-hand side) is of order V j \t j , where \t j is the gyrofrequency ( q j B / M j ) , and the frictional term is of order V j v j where v j is the collision frequency. As long as τ \b \t − 1 j or v − 1 j , the acceleration term can be neglected. Collision frequencies and gyrofrequencies are sufficiently high that, in most problems of interest to macroscopic dynamics, the acceleration term can be ignored. Also, since fluid velocities are usually subsonic, if L is greater than the gyro radius and the mean free path, the advective term is small. The plasma constituents are thus assumed to be in velocity equilibrium with the existing force fields. The equilibrium fluid velocity of each species may now be found from (2.27a) by setting the total time derivative equal to zero and specifying the force fields and pressure distributions 0 =−∇ \u0003 n j k B T j \u0004 + n j M j g + q j n j \u0003 E + V j × B \u0004 − \u0004 k k \u0004= j n j M j v jk \u0003 V j − V k \u0004 (2.28)"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"40 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics The collision frequencies v jk play a crucial role in a partially ionized plasma. Texts by Rishbeth and Garriott (1969), Banks and Kockarts (1973), and Schunk and Nagy (2000) discuss the physics in some detail. Here it suffices to plot and discuss representative collision profiles such as those given in Fig. 2.3, which are valid for high sunspot conditions (e.g., see Johnson, 1961). The numerical values of various ionospheric and atmospheric parameters used in making this plot are given in Appendix B. A useful approximate formula for the ion-neutral collision frequency is v in = 2 . 6 × 10 − 9 ( n n + n i ) A − 1 / 2 (2.29a) where A denotes the mean neutral molecular mass in atomic mass units and the electron neutral plus the electron ion collision frequency is v e ≡ v en + v ei = 5 . 4 × 10 − 10 n n T 1 / 2 e + \t 34 + 4 . 18 ln T 3 e / n e \u000b\f n e T − 3 / 2 e (2.29b) where T e is measured in Kelvin and all the densities are expressed per cubic centimeter. The ion-electron collision frequency is not included because it is negligible over the altitude range of interest. At night the electron-neutral col- lision frequency equals the electron-ion collision frequency near about 280 km. As we shall see, the equatorial F-region plasma is often driven to very high altitudes in the evening hours, and in such a case the transition height can be much higher. During the daytime, transition between v en and v ei occurs at about 200 km. For the moment we consider the case that electron-neutral colli- sions are more common than electron-ion collisions, which simplifies the algebra considerably. 1 0.01 0.1 10 2 10 10 3 10 4 10 5 Altitude (km) Collision frequencies (s 2 1 ) Ions Electrons (post midnight) Electrons (noon) 800 600 400 200 Figure 2.3 Typical electron neutral plus electron ion collision frequency along with the ion-neutral collision frequency at a high sunspot number."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 41 It is instructive and useful to solve (2.28) for the ion and electron velocities in terms of the driving forces. For simplicity we consider a single ion species of mass M , using the symbol m for the electron mass and the symbol e for the elemental charge, which is taken to be positive. For spatially uniform ion and electron temperatures, we have the two equations 0 =− k B T i ∇ n + nM g + ne ( E + V i × B ) − nMv in ( V i − U ) (2.30a) 0 =− k B T e ∇ n + nm g − ne ( E + V e × B ) − nmv en ( V e − U ) (2.30b) where we have used the fact that n i = n e = n , the plasma density. The electric field in this equation is the one that would be measured in an earth-fixed coordinate system. This is usually the electric field that is measured in ionospheric experi- ments. It is nevertheless instructive to express these equations in a reference frame moving with the neutral flow velocity U . Transformation between two coordi- nate systems moving at a relative velocity U does not leave the electric field invariant even if | U | c , where c is the speed of light. Jackson (1975) discusses transformation of the electromagnetic fields E and B between two coordinate systems and shows that in the moving frame, E \u0003 = ( E + U × B ) \r 1 − U 2 / c 2 \u000b 1 / 2 (2.31a) B \u0003 = B − U × E / c 2 \u000b\r 1 − U 2 / c 2 \u000b 1 / 2 (2.31b) where the primed variables are those measured in the moving frame and the unprimed variables are measured in the earth-fixed frame. It is easy to show that the U × E / c 2 term in (2.31b) is small compared to B for any reasonable values of U and E in the earth’s atmosphere or ionosphere. However, U × B is the same order of magnitude as E and must be retained. Thus, for | U | c , E \u0003 = E + U × B (2.32a) B \u0003 = B (2.32b) Another way to interpret these equations is that in a nonrelativistic transfor- mation the current density is not significantly changed, J \u0003 ∼ = J , but the charge density is, ρ \u0003 c \u0004= ρ c . The explanation for this “asymmetry” between the electric and magnetic fields lies in the fact that very small charge densities can produce significant electric fields in a plasma.

Notice that the velocity W \u0003 j is the fluid velocity that would arise in an unmagnetized plasma subject to the same forces. The absolute value of κ j determines whether a particle does or does not make a cycle about the magnetic field before a collision takes place. For a small absolute value of κ j , many collisions occur and the particle basically moves parallel to the applied forces as if there were no magnetic field. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.4a for ions and electrons subject to an electric field. The collisionless case ( κ infinite) is shown in Fig. 2.4b for particles initially at rest. After about one gyroperiod the particles are moving at right angles to the electric field. In this important case the final velocity is identical for ions and electrons and equal to E × B / B 2 . For an absolute value of κ = 1 (Fig. 2.4c), the net motion is at a 45 ◦ angle to the electric field. These results can be seen analytically from (2.34). Consider first the case of a very high collision frequency ( κ j 1).

Furthermore, since the first term does not depend on the charge, it is identical for ions and electrons. The ions and electrons move together at the “ E × B ” velocity in a collisionless plasm, and no net current flows in response to an applied electric field. Thus, Ohm’s law in its usual form is of little use in a collisionless magnetized plasma. There is another interesting subtlety in (2.36c).

The transition from a molecular ion plasma (NO + and O + 2 ) to an atomic ion plasma (O + ) has been included in the calculation of κ . The absolute value of κ e passes through unity near 75 km, while κ i does so at 130 km. In making the plot of κ e , we have used the total electron collision frequency v e = v en + v ei . This is not entirely consistent with the preceding discussion, which assumes v e = v en . However, the modification is of little importance, since the absolute value of κ e is very large above 100 km. The relationship between J \u0003 and E \u0003 may now be determined from the definition J \u0003 = ne ( V \u0003 i − V \u0003 e ) , with V \u0003 j given by (2.37a,b) and (2.35). The result may be expressed through a tensor relationship J \u0003 = σ · E \u0003 , where σ = ⎛ ⎝ σ P − σ H 0 σ H σ P 0 00 σ 0 ⎞ ⎠ (2.38) To obtain this form, B has been taken to be parallel to the z -axis, and we have defined σ 0 = ne ( b i − b e ) (2.39a) σ P = ne \t b i \r 1 + κ 2 i \u000b − b e \r 1 + κ 2 e \u000b\f (2.39b) σ H = ( ne / B ) \t κ 2 e \r 1 + κ 2 e \u000b − κ 2 i \r 1 + κ 2 i \u000b\f (2.39c) The three conductivity parameters, σ 0 , σ P , and σ H , are called the specific, Pedersen, and Hall conductivities, respectively. (Remember that b e is negative.) Plots of σ 0 , σ P , and σ H for a typical daytime midlatitude ionosphere are given in Fig. 2.6. These plots correspond to the daytime collision frequencies in Fig. 2.3 and a magnetic field of 5 × 10 − 5 tesla (0.5 gauss). The specific or parallel conduc- tivity σ 0 is dominated by the high electron mobility and is equal to ne 2 / mv e to a good approximation. At high altitudes when electron-neutral collisions become rare, the plasma density factor in v ei cancels the same factor in the numerator of σ 0 , and therefore σ 0 is independent of density above 400 km. The variation above that height displayed in Fig. 2.6 is related to the electron temperature, since according to (2.29b), v ei is very nearly proportional to ( T e ) − 3 / 2 . The par- allel conductivity is so high that the ratio σ 0 /σ P is greater than 1 × 10 4 above 130 km.

More usually we measure the neutral wind U and electric field E in the earth-fixed frame. However, since E \u0003 = E + U × B and J = J \u0003 for nonrelativistic transformations, we have the important and most usual form of the current equation J = σ · ( E + U × B ) (2.41) where all parameters are measured in the earth-fixed coordinates. Earth-fixed measurements of electric fields, of course, can determine only the E in (2.41), not the entire quantity E \u0003 = E + U × B . To summarize, we note that the ionospheric plasma is subject to electromag- netic forces in addition to those felt by the neutral atmosphere.

Electric fields thus play a dominant role in the dynamics of the ionosphere. In the next sections we briefly discuss the genera- tion and mapping of electric fields. Specific electric field sources are discussed as they arise in subsequent chapters. 2.3 Generation of Electric Fields Although we have allowed for the possibility of an electric field in the earth’s upper atmosphere, we have yet to show that such fields exist. The other forces in (2.28) are, for our present purposes, given quantities—that is, the forces due to the plasma pressure gradients to the magnetic and gravitational fields, and to the atmospheric winds. Electric fields arise as a result of these forces when the ions and electrons respond differently to them. This is expressed quantitatively via the current divergence equation ∇· J =− ∂ρ c /∂ t (2.42) Any charge density, ρ c , of course, must create electric fields through Poisson’s equation ∇· E = ρ c /ε 0 (2.43) Given the complexity of the forces in (2.28), it is not surprising that the electric current associated with the difference between the ion and electron velocities has a finite divergence. However, this divergence creates a charge density via (2.42) that, via (2.43), creates an electric field that forces the divergence to zero. In other words, if the complex forces acting on the ion and electron fluids create a divergence in J , an electric field builds up quickly to modify the fluid velocities so that once again ∇· J = 0. For example, consider an electric field of 10 mV / m, which is large by equatorial and midlatitude standards. Assuming a scale length of 1 km in (2.43), we find ρ c = 8 . 85 × 10 − 17 C / m 3 , which amounts to an excess of ions or electrons of a few thousand per cubic meter compared to a total of at least 10 9 m − 3 . The time scale for buildup of such a charge density can be estimated from (2.42) and (2.43). From (2.42) τ ∼ ρ c / ∇· J = ε 0 ∇· E / ∇· J Assuming for the moment that σ is uniform and isotropic, then J = σ E and τ ∼ = ε 0 /σ (2.44)"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"48 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Using the lowest value of any component of σ in the ionosphere, we find the largest value for τ = 10 − 6 s. Electric fields thus build up very quickly indeed in response to any divergence of J . Such divergences arise whenever there are spa- tially varying forces on the plasma or when the conductivity changes in space. In practice, it is not possible to calculate ρ c from (2.42) and then E from (2.43). Rather, the electric field is treated as a free parameter that adjusts in magnitude and direction to fit the requirement that ∇· J = 0. In the next chapters we show in detail how electric fields arise in the earth’s ionosphere. When an electric field is created by a wind, the process is often called a dynamo in analogy to a motor-driven electric generator in which a conductor is moved across a magnetic field. In this case, or any case in which electrical energy is created, the quantity ( J · E ) should be negative, and in addition the electrical forces must act in opposition to the source of the charge separation. When electric fields are applied from an external source, such as occurs at high latitudes due to the solar wind–magnetosphere interaction, it is usually the case that J · E > 0 in the ionosphere. In this case electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy in the ionosphere and is released in the form of heat. Such Joule heating is a very important process at high latitudes and may greatly affect the thermospheric winds. In this case the ionosphere acts like an electrical load on some external generator. Likewise, momentum may be transferred to the thermospheric gas through the “ion drag” term if the ions are driven very strongly by an externally applied electric field. In such a case the ionosphere- magnetosphere system acts like a motor with electrical energy converted into mechanical energy. 2.4 Electric Field Mapping The high conductivity parallel to the earth’s magnetic field, σ 0 , has important implications concerning the transmission of electric fields for long distances along B . In fact, if σ 0 were infinite, there would be zero potential drop along the magnetic field, and the potential difference between any two field lines would be constant. In such a case any electric field generated at ionospheric heights would be transmitted along the magnetic field lines to very high altitudes. For example, an electric field generated at 60 ◦ magnetic latitude would be communicated to the equatorial plane at an altitude over 25 , 000 km. Likewise, electric fields of solar wind or magnetospheric origin could be transmitted to ionospheric heights. This phenomenon can be studied quantitatively as follows (following Farley, 1959, 1960). Suppose first that the conductivity is anisotropic but uniform and that the neutral wind is absent.

That is, the sub- stitution has transformed the real medium into an equivalent isotropic medium with a greatly reduced depth parallel to the magnetic field (the z direction in the calculation). The ratio ( σ 0 /σ P ) 1 / 2 is plotted in Fig. 2.7 for a typical iono- spheric profile. Above 130 km the ratio exceeds 100, reaching 1000 at 300 km. At high altitudes, σ 0 becomes independent of density. The ratio σ 0 /σ P continues to increase as the ion-neutral collision frequency and the plasma density, which determine σ P , continue to decrease.

For many applications, MHD theory applies on the high-altitude portions of the field lines that contact the ionosphere. This theory is discussed in the next section in the context of the “frozen-in” condition. The implication of these calculations is that large-scale electrical features per- pendicular to B map for long distances along the earth’s magnetic field lines. This has been verified experimentally via the simultaneous measurements shown in Fig. 2.8. In this experiment the zonal electric field component was measured in the Northern Hemispheric ionosphere with the Millstone Hill Radar (see Appendix A) and in the inner magnetosphere at a point very close to where the same magnetic field line crossed the equatorial plane. The latter measure- ment was accomplished using the whistler technique (Carpenter et al., 1972). The two measurements clearly have the same temporal form, but the magneto- spheric component is 10 times smaller. This difference may be explained as a geometric effect arising from the spreading of the magnetic field lines as follows. First we take σ 0 to be infinite so that the field lines act like perfect conductors. This implies that there is no potential difference along them and in turn that the voltage difference between two lines is conserved. The magnetic flux density (measured in tesla) decreases along the field line as a function of distance from the mid- or high-latitude ionosphere to the equatorial plane in the magnetosphere.

For a dipole field, Mozer (1970) has shown that the two electric field components (meridional E MI and zonal E ZI ) map from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere in the equatorial plane as E MI = 2 L \u0013 L − 3 4 \u0014 1 / 2 E RM (2.48a) E ZI = L 3 / 2 E ZM (2.48b) where the L value is the distance from the center of the earth to the equatorial crossing point measured in earth radii ( R e ) , E RM is the radial magnetospheric component at the equatorial plane, and E ZM is the zonal magnetospheric com- ponent there. The equation for the zonal component (2.48b) is in excellent agree- ment with the corresponding data in Fig. 2.8. Notice that the zonal ionospheric electric field component maps to a zonal field in the equatorial plane but that the meridional component in the ionosphere, E MI , becomes radial in the equatorial plane ( E RM ) . In particular, a poleward ionospheric electric field points radially outward at the equatorial plane. Thus, large-scale electric fields generated in the E and F regions of the ionosphere can map upward to the magnetosphere and create motions there. Likewise, electric fields of magnetospheric and solar wind origin can map from deep space to ionospheric heights and have even been detected by balloons at stratospheric heights (Mozer and Serlin, 1969). For per- fectly conducting field lines, the ratio E 2 / B is conserved, since B varies as the area, while E varies as the linear distance along the magnetic field. Farley (1959) studied the upward mapping process realistically by includ- ing the z dependence of the conductivities in his analysis. The basic equations ∇· J = 0, E =−∇ φ , and J = σ · E are the same used in deriving (2.47), and, with the assumption that variations of σ occur only in the z direction, they yield ∂ 2 φ/∂ x 2 + ∂ 2 φ/∂ y 2 + ( 1 /σ P ) ∂/∂ z ( σ 0 ∂φ/∂ z ) = 0 The same change of variables now yields \u0003 ∇ \u0003 \u0004 2 φ + \u0003 ∂φ/∂ z \u0003 \u0004\u0003 ∂/∂ z \u0003 \u0004 \t ln ( σ 0 σ P ) 1 / 2 \f = 0 (2.49a) where ( σ 0 σ P ) 1 / 2 = σ m is termed the geometric mean conductivity.

The implication here is that if very large-scale electric fields are generated in the E region, the potential differences thereby created map up into the F-region ionosphere and beyond along the magnetic field lines deep into space. As we shall see, these low-altitude electric fields dominate motions of the plasma throughout the dense plasma region around the earth, termed the plasmasphere. Considering sources at F region and even higher altitudes, in the magneto- sphere and solar wind, for example, the previous analysis can be used to show that the mapping efficiency to the E region is even greater. In fact, within the mag- netospheric and solar wind plasmas, the parallel conductivity is often taken to be infinite, and thus the parallel electric field vanishes even when finite field-aligned currents flow. As we shall see later, this assumption that E || = 0 is a powerful analytical device, allowing great conceptual simplifications in the understand- ing of magnetospheric electric field and flow patterns. On the other hand, it is exactly in the regions where the assumption of infinite conductivity breaks down that very interesting phenomena occur. The generation of the aurora is an example. Since large-scale electric fields map along the magnetic field lines, we may consider them to be independent of z in the magnetic coordinate system just used ( B in the z direction). This has some interesting consequences for ionospheric electrodynamics. Consider the current divergence equation separated into its perpendicular and parallel parts: ∇ ⊥ · J ⊥ =− ∂ J z /∂ z where J ⊥ = σ ⊥ · ( E ⊥ + U × B ) and σ ⊥ is the 2 × 2 perpendicular conductivity matrix. Ignoring the neutral wind for the moment, ∇ ⊥ · ( σ ⊥ · E ⊥ ) =− ∂ J z /∂ z Remembering that the z -axis is parallel to the magnetic field and integrating from the top of the Northern Hemisphere ionosphere ( z = 0) to a value z 0 below which no significant perpendicular currents flow yields J z ( 0 ) − J z ( z 0 ) = z 0 \u0002 0 [ ∇· ( σ ⊥ · E ⊥ ) ] dz Although small currents do exit the base of the ionosphere and link up with atmospheric electrical currents to complete the global atmospheric electrical"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 53 circuit, we ignore this interesting phenomenon by setting J z ( z 0 ) = 0. J z ( 0 ) is then the field-aligned current entering the ionosphere from above and is related to the divergence of the perpendicular current density. Now, since E ⊥ is inde- pendent of z , we may move it and the divergence operator through the integral to yield J z =∇· ( \u0004 · E ⊥ ) (2.50) where \u0004 is the perpendicular height-integrated conductivity tensor \u0004 = \u0015 \u0004 P − \u0004 H \u0004 H \u0004 P \u0016 and we have dropped the argument of J z and assume that we measure J z at a sufficiently high altitude that all perpendicular ionospheric currents are below it. Since conductivity has units of mhos per meter, \u0004 has units of mhos. The E-region values vary from a few tenths of a mho in the nighttime midlati- tude region to several tens of mhos during a strong auroral precipitation event. F-region values maximize at the magnetic equator where the field lines are very long and rapidly decrease at midlatitudes and higher. Some insight can be achieved by letting \u0004 be uniform in the horizontal directions.

Small-scale currents can be more than an order of magnitude higher. Field-aligned currents at mid- and low lati- tudes are much smaller but still play a very important role in the physics. Equation (2.51) plus Poisson’s equation (2.25b) show that current flows downward in the Northern Hemisphere where the net charge density in the ionosphere is positive."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"54 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics This seems counterintuitive but corresponds to the fact that the ionosphere is an electrical load at higher latitudes. Finally, we turn to the question of downward mapping of magnetospheric and ionospheric electric fields into the region below the ionosphere—that is, into the lower atmosphere. In the late 1960s it was realized that these fields could be detected at balloon altitudes ( ∼ 30 km), since most of the atmospheric resis- tivity is in the last atmospheric scale height, which has a value of about 8 km near the surface of the earth (Mozer and Serlin, 1969). At the surface of the earth, of course, horizontal fields must vanish, since the earth is a good conduc- tor compared with the atmosphere. However, at balloon height the horizontal ionospheric/magnetospheric electric field is almost unattenuated. Some theories of solar activity effects on climate appeal to this downward penetrating electric field as a causative factor. 2.5 Elements of Magnetospheric Physics One may choose between (at least) two philosophies when describing a collision- less magnetized plasma. In the magnetohydrodynamic approach, the plasma is considered as a single conducting fluid with a certain bulk flow velocity deter- mined by the forces acting on the fluid. These forces must include the electromag- netic force as well as the gravitational, pressure, and viscous forces acting on a hydrodynamic system. Another viewpoint considers the microscopic motions of particles subject to the various forces. Both descriptions are used in space plasma physics and are discussed in the next two sections. 2.5.1 The Guiding Center Equations and the Adiabatic Invariants One way to view particle dynamics is to consider the motion of the so-called guiding centers. In this picture the near-circular gyromotion about the magnetic field is considered to be the dominant motion with a time scale ( \t − 1 ) much shorter than any other dynamical time scale τ (i.e., \t − 1 τ ). To illustrate this, consider the single-particle motion associated with a general force F and the magnetic field B . Ignoring spatial derivatives, ( M ∂ V /∂ t ) = q ( V × B ) + F Taking the component parallel to B gives M \u0003 ∂ V || /∂ t \u0004 = F || which is straightforward. Perpendicular to B , this leaves ( M ∂ V ⊥ /∂ t ) = q ( V ⊥ × B ) + F ⊥ (2.52)"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 55 Now let V ⊥ = W D + u where W D = ( F ⊥ × B ) / qB 2 (2.53) This substitution is motivated by the result we already have that W D = ( E × B ) / B 2 when F ⊥ = q E . Substituting (2.53) into (2.52) yields M ∂ W D /∂ t + M ∂ u /∂ t = F ⊥ × B / B 2 \u000b × B + q u × B + F ⊥ The first term on the left vanishes, while the first term on the right-hand side equals − F ⊥ and thus cancels the other F ⊥ term. This leaves M ∂ u /∂ t = q ( u × B ) The solution to this, of course, is just the gyromotion at frequency \t = qB / M The interpretation we make is that in a frame moving at W D , the particle motion is pure gyration. This yields the concept of a guiding center motion, since W D gives the velocity of the center of gyromotion. Some examples of guiding center drifts due to various forces are as follows. For an electric field, F = q E and W D = q E × B / qB 2 = E × B / B 2 For the gravitational field, F = M g and W D = M g × B / qB 2 For the inertial force F =− M ∂ W D /∂ t and, letting W D = E × B / B 2 , W D = ( F × B ) / qB 2 = − 1 / qB 2 \u000b\t M ∂/∂ t E × B / B 2 \u000b × B \f W D =− M / qB 2 \u000b ( ∂ E /∂ t × B ) × B W D = M / qB 2 \u000b ( ∂ E /∂ t ) Notice that this expression can be related to a displacement current in the plasma, since using J = ( ne W Di − ne W De ) and M \b m yields J = ne M / eB 2 \u000b ∂ E /∂ t = nM / B 2 \u000b ∂ E /∂ t"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"56 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Substituting this into one of Maxwell’s equations, ∇× B = μ 0 J + μ 0 ε 0 ∂ E /∂ t gives ∇× B = μ 0 nM / B 2 + ε 0 \u000b ∂ E /∂ t so we can define a dielectric constant via the expression ε = nM / B 2 \u000b + ε 0 ∼ = nM / B 2 \u000b Now a required assumption necessary for using the guiding center approxi- mation is that the time scale τ>\t − 1 i . Hence, this dielectric constant should be valid for electromagnetic waves with frequencies f <\t i . Indeed, the expression for the phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave is V ph = ( 1 /μ 0 ε ) 1 / 2 Substituting the dielectric constant derived above yields V ph = B / ( μ 0 ρ ) 1 / 2 This velocity is the Alfvén speed, which is the velocity of an electromagnetic wave propagating parallel to B in a magnetized plasma when its frequency sat- isfies f \t i (e.g., Spitzer (1962) or any elementary plasma text). If the magnetic field is curved as in a dipole field, particles moving along B will feel a force given by F =− MV 2 || / R \u000b ˆ n where ˆ n is a unit vector pointed inward, V || is the particle velocity parallel to B , and R is the radius of curvature (see Fig. 2.13 for a sketch of the coordi- nate system).

The most “rugged” of these adiabatic invariants is the particle magnetic moment μ . Here, we prove that if the time scale for field changes is larger than τ g = \t − 1 (the gyroperiod), then μ is conserved. We refer the reader to Schmidt (1966) for proof that conservation also holds if the length scale for changes in B is much greater than r gi (the ion gyroradius).

The energy change in one gyration is thus \u0011 K g = \u0002 q E · d l We can transform this to a surface integral \u0011 K g = q \u0002\u0002 ( ∇× E ) · d a"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 59 and using (2.23a) \u0011 K g =− q \u0002\u0002 \u0003 ∂ B / dt \u0004 · d a Note that the vectors q B and d a are in opposite directions.

For illustrative purposes, we can apply these findings to a “magnetic bottle” geometry similar to the earth’s magnetic field as illustrated in Fig. 2.10. Suppose a particle starts on the symmetry axis at the place where the field strength is B 0 and the velocity vector of the particle makes an angle α (the pitch angle) with respect to the magnetic field line. At the magnetic equator, then, V || = V cos α , V ⊥ = V sin α The velocity V || carries the particle into a region of larger field strength, as shown in Fig. 2.10b.

That the particle eventually bounces off the increasing magnetic field and returns toward the equatorial plane and the other hemisphere can be seen as follows. The magnitude of the Lorentz force is | F L |= qV ⊥ B . From Fig. 2.10b it is clear that the direction of the force is to the left, which is opposite to the particle parallel velocity. Even at the right-hand side of the figure where the parallel velocity has gone to zero, we see that F L = q V ⊥ × B still has a small component of force toward the magnetic equator due to the convergence of the magnetic field lines. The parallel velocity of the particle will increase until the equatorial plane is crossed. Then the axial component of the Lorentz force reverses sign and the particle again slows down and is eventually reflected. If the initial pitch angle is too small, the particle will penetrate so deeply into the atmosphere at the end of the “bottle” that it will be lost by collisions. A “loss cone” then develops in the distribution function such that particles with pitch angles less than a certain value α 0 escape and particles with α>α 0 are trapped for many bounce cycles. This bounce motion leads to another time scale with a time constant τ bounce , which can be considered in the particle dynamics. A second adiabatic invariant is related to this dynamical time scale. The second invariant holds only for time variations much longer than τ bounce . Finally, the gradient and curvature drifts take particles entirely around the earth, creating another time scale τ drift that is related to a third adiabatic invariant. This has an even longer time scale, so it is the easiest condition to break down.

We now raise the interesting question “Can the current in some complicated plasma problem be computed using only the guiding center equations?” As pointed out by Spitzer (1962), the answer is no, since the guiding center current is only part of the total current. The particle gyromotion produces an additional current if there is a population gradient, exactly analogous to the magnetization current, that arises from edge effects in solids. When this contribution is calcu- lated exactly, it contains a term that can even cancel the gradient and curvature drift terms. The actual currents have nothing to do with the values of B and ∇ B , and we must use the macroscopic equations given in Section 2.5.2. The sign of the current is generally given correctly by the sign of the gradient and curvature drifts, but the magnitudes must be derived from other equations. 2.5.2 Magnetohydrodynamics We now take up a second viewpoint on the dynamics of a collisionless magnetized plasma. In magnetohydrodynamics it is conjectured that the electrical conduc- tivity is so high parallel to B that in a reference frame moving with velocity V = E × B / B 2 the electric field vanishes both parallel and perpendicular to B . Since this is the plasma reference frame, the plasma can be considered as a single fluid having infinite conductivity. Study of such a one-fluid model is referred to as magneto- hydrodynamics. Its range of applicability is particularly great in astrophysics due to the large distance scales involved. Thus, plasmas in the solar wind, solar flares, sunspots, the earth’s magnetosphere, and interstellar regions can all be treated to first order with a magnetohydrodynamic approach. A close analogy exists with hydrodynamics, in which, as we have noted, a single fluid is subject to a variety of forces: pressure, viscosity, gravity, and so forth. The presence of an electrical conductivity requires the inclusion of Maxwell’s equations and a volume force on the fluid given by J × B . We thus have the continuity equation ∂ρ/∂ t +∇· ( ρ V ) = 0 (2.55a) the equation of motion, ρ \u0003 d V dt \u0004 =−∇ p + ρ g + J × B (2.55b)"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics and Maxwell’s equations, ∇× B = μ 0 J ∇× E =− ∂ B /∂ t ∇· B = 0 ∇· E = ρ c /ε 0 where the vacuum displacement current has been ignored due to the high conduc- tivity and low frequency. These equations constitute the single-fluid description of a magnetized plasma or of conducting fluids such as the element mercury and the earth’s molten core. If we neglect the displacement current, we can also set ∇· E = 0, since ρ c = 0. Whatever electric fields are present, they change in space only when ∂ B /∂ t is nonzero or the reference frame is changed. These equations constitute an MHD approximation, and to them must be added a relationship between the fields and currents. For a true conducting fluid this is just J \u0003 = σ E \u0003 since the conductivity is isotropic. As before, E \u0003 is the electric field in the frame moving with the fluid. In some other frame in which the plasma velocity is V and the electric field is E , we have E = E \u0003 − V × B and J = J \u0003 , B = B \u0003 for V c . Thus, J = J \u0003 = σ E \u0003 and J = σ ( E + V × B ) (2.55c) with J , E , V , and B all measured in the second frame. The conductivity of a plasma is not isotropic, so it is not clear that the MHD fluid approach should work. However, for a collisionless plasma, σ 0 is so high parallel to B that in the frame of reference moving with the plasma the electric field is zero. This is also true in an infinitely conducting isotropic fluid. Thus, in the limit that σ 0 goes to infinity, the plasma will behave like an infinitely conducting fluid, even though it is an anisotropic material. For σ large, E \u0003 ≈ 0 and (2.55c) is not very useful. Instead, for the perpendicular component of J , we solve (2.55b) for J ⊥ by taking the cross product with the magnetic field. Then, J ⊥ = B ×∇ ρ B 2 + ρ \u0003 g × B \u0004 B 2 − ρ \u0013 d V dt × B \u0014\u0017 B 2 (2.56) which is independent of E ."},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 63 Finally, we need an equation of state. Several possibilities exist depending on the properties of the fluid. For a true conducting metallic fluid like mercury or the earth’s core, we could use the incompressibility condition ∇· V = 0 For a fluid with a high heat conductivity, we could use isothermal conditions dT / dt = d \u0003 p /ρ \u0004 / dt = 0 or for an adiabatic fluid d \u0003 p γ /ρ γ \u0004 / dt = 0 The particular equation of state to be used depends on the application. To reduce the number of equations and gain physical insight, the current density and electric field can be eliminated. Returning to the equation of motion and ignoring viscosity and gravity, we have ρ \u0003 d V / dt \u0004 =−∇ p + J × B =−∇ p + ( 1 /μ 0 )( ∇× B ) × B (2.57) Using the vector identity ∇ ( X · Y ) = ( X ·∇ ) Y + ( Y ·∇ ) X + X × ( ∇× Y ) + Y × ( ∇× X ) with X = Y = B yields ∇ B 2 \u000b = 2 ( B ·∇ ) B + 2 B × ( ∇× B ) and thus the J × B term in (2.57) becomes f B = ( 1 /μ 0 ) ( ∇× B ) × B =−∇ B 2 / 2 μ 0 \u000b + ( B ·∇ ) B /μ 0 and the equation of motion becomes ρ \u0003 d V / dt \u0004 =−∇ p + B 2 / 2 μ 0 \u000b + ( B ·∇ ) B /μ 0 (2.58) We study this equation in more detail following.

The concepts of magnetic pressure and tension are derivable from (2.60c). One should remember that the terms involving the magnetic field B all stem from the J × B force but that J and B are inextricably related through Maxwell’s equa- tions. Thus, any deviation of B from a force-free configuration must be balanced by fluid pressure when the fluid is in equilibrium. Fluid acceleration occurs in the case of a nonequilibrium condition. For example, it is straightforward to show that the dipole magnetic field in the upper portion of Fig. 2.12 is such that the magnetic terms in (2.60c) cancel everywhere outside the core of the earth. The distorted dipole field shown following, however, has forces that will cause the plasma to flow back toward the earth. Since ∇× B \u0004= 0 in this distorted field, there must be a current in the region, as indicated. Such a current is asso- ciated with a J × B force on the plasma in the direction toward the earth, since there is a small component of B upward while J is out of the page. This J × B force is equivalent to the magnetic pressure and magnetic tension forces. In a steady state, then, there must be a particle pressure gradient pointing toward the earth. The meaning of the magnetic terms can be understood in a local coordinate system (see Fig. 2.13) defined by a unit vector ˆ s parallel to B , a unit vector ˆ n Distorted dipole (plasma sheet) Force-free dipole (no plasma) 3 B 5 \u0005 0 J B J 3 B J 3 B 5 0 Figure 2.12 Illustration of the difference between a force-free dipole and a distorted field configuration.

The sense of T B is similar to that of forces due to tension in a stretched string, which are parallel to ˆ n and proportional to 1 / R (see Fig. 2.13). As noted above, for a dipole field the tension and pressure forces in the ˆ n direction exactly cancel (as they must when ∇× B = 0 ) . The case of an equilibrium requires d V / dt = 0, which in turn implies from (2.57) 0 =−∇ p + J × B which is equivalent to ∇ p + B 2 / 2 μ 0 \u000b = ( B ·∇ ) B /μ 0 The magnetic pressure ( B 2 / 2 μ 0 ) enters just like the particle pressure, while the curvature (tension) term appears on the right-hand side of this force balance equation. These concepts are quite useful in discussing magnetospheric dynamics and equilibria. Equation (2.60d) also has an interesting and useful interpretation. Assuming first that σ is infinite, ∂ B /∂ t −∇× ( V × B ) = 0 Consider the magnetic flux φ across an arbitrary surface \u0004 moving with velocity V : d φ/ dt = \u0002\u0002 S ( ∂ B /∂ t ) · d a + \u0002 B · \u0003 V × d l \u0004 The first integral yields the change in φ due to the time variation of B and the second integral yields the change due to the motion of the surface. Working on this second term, \u0002 B · \u0003 V × d l \u0004 =− \u0002 ( V × B ) · d l =− \u0002\u0002 S ∇× ( V × B ) · d a"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 67 so d φ/ dt = \u0002\u0002 S [ ∂ B /∂ t −∇× ( V × B ) ] · d a But for σ infinite we have shown that the bracket vanishes so d φ/ dt = 0 Thus, the flux is constant through the surface. We say that the magnetic fluid is “frozen in” and can be considered to move with the fluid. In this sense, if the magnetic field line is labeled by particles on the line at time t , they still label the line at any other time. The concept of frozen-in field lines is very useful and allows visualization of complex flow if we know the magnetic field geometry. Conversely, if the motion is known, the field geometry can be deduced. If σ \u0004=∞ , the field can slip through the fluid, and we have ∂ B /∂ t −∇× ( V × B ) = ( 1 /μ 0 σ ) ∇ 2 B For a stationary case ( V = 0), ∂ B /∂ t = ( 1 /μ 0 σ ) ∇ 2 B which is a diffusion equation. If the diffusion scale length is L , the diffusion time constant is given by τ = μ 0 σ L 2 For typical laboratory dimensions, L is small and so, even for good conductors, τ is short. In cosmic plasmas or conducting fluids, however, τ is large, and the concept of frozen-in fields is correspondingly important. Before leaving this section, it is useful to derive an energy relationship based on MHD principles. The particle pressure p = nk B T is equivalent to the particle energy density, and this is also true for magnetic pressure and magnetic energy density. That is, B 2 /2 μ 0 yields the energy stored in a magnetic field per unit volume. The total stored magnetic energy in a system is then W B = ( 1 / 2 μ 0 ) \u0002 B 2 dV where dV is the volume element and we have used a single integral sign to designate a triple integral. Changes of this quantity with time can be written ∂ W B /∂ t = ( 1 /μ 0 ) \u0002 ( B · ∂ B /∂ t ) dV"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"68 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Then using ∂ B /∂ t =−∇× E , B = μ 0 H , and the vector identity ∇· ( E × B ) = B · ( ∇× E ) − E · ( ∇× B ) , we have ∂ W B /∂ t =− \u0002 ∇· ( E × H ) dV − \u0002 E · ( ∇× H ) dV Using J = σ( E + V × B ) and J =∇× H and applying the divergence theorem to convert the first volume integral to a surface integral gives ∂ W B /∂ t =− \u0002\u0002 S ( E × H ) · d a − \u0002 \u0007\u0003 J /σ − V × B \u0004 · J \b dV where the area element d a points outward from the surface of the volume.

In a truly closed magnetosphere with the surface an equipotential, no energy crosses the surface ( E is everywhere normal to an equipotential), and there could be no internal circulation (convection), no dissipation by ionospheric currents, and no storage of magnetic energy for later release (e.g., in what are called magnetic substorms). Two sources for generating a component of E parallel to the magnetopause, and thus a net Poynting flux inward, are viscous interaction and reconnection. Both of these processes thus can result in a net flow of energy into the magnetosphere. We return to these matters in Chapter 8. 2.6 Are Ionospheric Electric Fields Real? Vasyliunas and Song (2005) have argued that the paradigm used in ionospheric physics is based on a false premise: that ionospheric electric fields cause the plasma motions. They argue that the plasma velocity is fundamental and that it generates the electric field rather than the other way around. Such an argument is clearly valid in the case of the solar wind, which is driven by intense pressure and has no electric field in the wind frame. In the frame of the earth, however, there is an electric field equal to − V × B in a region that is connected to the polar ionosphere by magnetic field lines. Is this field real, or is it generated by the motion of the polar cap plasma?"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Fundamentals of Atmospheric, Ionospheric, and Magnetospheric Plasma Dynamics 69 Information is transmitted from one region to the other in the solar wind– magnetosphere–ionosphere system by waves of various types. For example, the solar wind generates Alfvén waves, which travel down magnetic field lines carry- ing energy and momentum. This system can be described as a transmission line with the ionosphere as the load. If the load impedance (the field line-integrated Pedersen conductivity ( \u0004 P )) does not match the transmission line impedance ( η A ), reflection will occur, but after a few bounce times this electrodynamic descrip- tion may be replaced by what is termed electroquasistatics. Most of ionospheric physics is carried out in this context. Vasyliunas and Song (2005) have argued that the use of quasistatics hides the fundamental physics and that electric fields cannot be thought of as act- ing on the plasma. Rather, only the plasma velocity matters, and the electric field is an illusion of one’s frame of reference. In this approach, the waves put the ionosphere in motion and the electric field follows. However, decades of successful application of electroquasistatics in the ionosphere should not be replaced when it is applicable. This approach is valid on time scales longer than the scale of the system divided by the Alfvén speed or equivalently, for the Alfvén wavelength larger than the system scale. We argue that if you live on a resistor—for example, the ionosphere—then the electric field and Joule heating are very real and can be used as a proper language. In this text we use electroquasistatics whenever possible. At times we do use the full electrody- namic approach, such as for the solar wind–generated Poynting flux input to the polar cap. 2.7 Coordinate Systems In standard meteorological practice, a local coordinate system has the x -axis eastward, the y -axis to the north, and the z -axis vertically upward. The three components of the neutral wind vector U are usually denoted by ( u , v , w )in those coordinates. We will use this notation here as well. Some complication arises in ionospheric plasma studies due to the importance of the magnetic field direction and the fact that it varies from horizontal at the magnetic equator to vertical at the poles. The reader should be alert to this and to the fact that the magnetic coordinate systems vary somewhat in the text. For example, in Chapters 3 and 4 we use a coordinate system in which the magnetic field is in the direction of the y -axis. The conductivity tensor does not, then, have the form given in (2.38). In deriving (2.38) and in Chapters 5–10 we have taken B parallel to the z -axis. The reader should be aware of the possible confusion caused by the use of different coordinate systems. Furthermore, in the Northern Hemisphere the “ z -axis” associated with meteorology is nearly antiparallel to the magnetic field-aligned z -axis. In addition, researchers sometimes define a ˆ z \u0003 axis antiparallel to B in the Northern Hemisphere."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"70 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics References Banks, P.

To a great extent our knowledge of the electrical structure of this region comes from measurements made at the Jicamarca Radio Observatory, located just east of Lima, Peru. This incoherent scatter radar facility was designed to optimize measurements of plasma flow perpendicular to the earth’s magnetic field, which is nearly horizontal over the site. In the F region of the ionosphere, κ i and κ e are very large, so the ion and electron velocities perpendicular to B are very nearly equal to each other. This means that a plasma flow velocity can be uniquely defined and related to the electric field. We deal first with the generation of electric fields by thermospheric winds in the F region and follow with an analysis of the E-region dynamo and the equatorial electrojet. The latter is an intense current jet that flows in the E region at the magnetic equator. These dynamos are the primary sources of the low-latitude electric field, but high-latitude processes also contribute and are discussed as well. An introduction to D-region dynamics is also presented. 3.1 Motions of the Equatorial F Region: The Database We choose first to study the equatorial F-layer dynamo, since it seems concep- tually simpler, although it was not discovered first. Most of the data concern- ing equatorial electrodynamics come from incoherent scatter radar observations near the magnetic equator over Jicamarca, Peru. Details concerning Jicamarca and several other observatories are given in Appendix A, along with a discussion of the measurement method. The Jicamarca system is capable of determining the plasma temperature, density, composition, and ion drift velocity as functions of altitude and time from the backscatter due to thermal fluctuations in the plasma. The radar can be directed perpendicular to the magnetic field, where the fre- quency width of the backscatter spectrum is very narrow—meaning that even small mean Doppler shifts can be detected and converted to very accurate iono- spheric drift velocities. In practice, the radar is split into two beams, one oriented 3 ◦ to the geomagnetic east and one 3 ◦ to the geomagnetic west.

In the F region, κ i is very large, and the ion velocity perpendicular to B is given by (2.36d)—that is, ( V i ) ⊥ = \u0002 E − \u0003 k B T i / q i \u0004 ∇ n / n + \u0003 M / q i \u0004 g \u0005 × \u0006 B / B 2 \u0007 (3.1) where all quantities are measured in the earth-fixed frame. Notice that the neutral wind velocity does not appear in this equation, so the radar measurements cannot be used directly to measure any F-region wind components perpendicular to B . At typical measurement heights, we can estimate the drift velocities due to the pressure and gravity terms. The former is the order of k B T i / q i LB , where L is the density gradient scale length. Taking L = 10 km and T i = 1000 K yields a drift velocity of roughly 0.4 m/s. The gravitational drift is even smaller, less than one-tenth of this value. Since the observed drift velocities are much greater than these values, they must be due to the electric field. These results hold for both daytime and nighttime conditions; that is, inco- herent scatter radar measurements in the F region can, in principle and often in practice, yield the ion drift and thus the electric field at all local times (Fejer, 1991). There are some limitations of the technique, however. A plasma instability termed equatorial spread F often occurs in the evening and, when present, precludes incoherent scatter measurements, even in the upper F region. Also, the incoherent scatter method requires a minimum plasma density in the scattering volume determined by the system noise, antenna size, transmitter power, integration time, and so on. For the Jicamarca Radar Observatory, this minimum is about 10 4 cm − 3 , which often precludes measurements at night in the altitude range below the F peak. Barium ion cloud releases, rocket probes, and radar interferometric methods have been used successfully in this height range. A compilation of the Jicamarca data set spanning nearly an entire solar cycle is presented in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2. In Fig. 3.1 the zonal eastward drift measured near the F peak is plotted, whereas in Fig. 3.2 the vertical drift component is shown. Both solar and seasonal dependencies are illustrated, and both components have a strong diurnal modulation. To first order, the drifts are up and to the west during the day and down and to the east at night. Some aspects we wish to emphasize are as follows: 1. The peak eastward drift at night is twice as great as the peak westward drift during the day. 2. The zonal drifts are much larger than the vertical velocities. 3. The vertical drift is often strongly enhanced just after sunset but shows no comparable feature near sunrise. This is termed the prereversal enhancement of the vertical drift or, equivalently, of the eastward electric field component. 4. There are strong solar cycle effects in the vertical drifts and moderate seasonal effects in both data sets."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 73 200 Jicamarca eastward drift velocity Summer Equinox Winter m/s 100 100 Flux . 120 Flux , 120 2 100 08 12 16 20 Local time (75 8 W) 00 04 08 0 0 Figure 3.1 Seasonal variations of the zonal plasma drifts during periods of low and high solar flux.

Thus, a zonal eastward drift is due to a vertically downward electric field component, with a 100 m/s drift corresponding to a 2.5 mV/m electric field. Likewise, an upward drift of 40 m/s corresponds to an eastward electric field of about 1 mV/m. Evidence for the repeatability of the average drifts just plotted is given in Fig. 3.3, where a large number of individual 24 h measurement sets are superim- posed. Except for the July 1968 event, which was associated with changes in the interplanetary magnetic field, the data are remarkably well behaved. Such a plot suggests that the temporal sequences plotted in these figures can be interpreted equally well in terms of Universal Time measurements, at least in an average sense. That is, if we take a snapshot of the instantaneous electric field pattern around the earth’s equatorial zone, it should look very much like the Jicamarca equatorial measurements as a function of local time plotted here.

An equivalent statement is that the voltage difference between the dusk and dawn terminators (see Fig. 3.5) when the electric field is westward (at night) should equal the voltage drop when the field is eastward (during the day). Fejer et al. (1979) performed this calculation for a number of days using the Jicamarca time series, and the results are plotted in Fig. 3.4. To first order, the voltage drop across the dayside is close to the drop across the night, both equaling about 8 kV. The agreement is not perfect, however, and the ratio V NIGHT / V DAY dropped as low as 0.5 in October 1975–1976, indicat- ing that local conditions may affect the Jicamarca measurements and that the 24-hour plots may not represent an instantaneous pattern in some seasons. The prereversal enhancement may also have a different seasonal behavior in different longitude sectors. Evidence for this comes from the different seasonal behavior of the equatorial spread F around the globe (see Chapter 4). Since the prereversal enhancement (17–19 LT) accounts for 40% of the dayside voltage, its variability is important. Pingree and Fejer (1987) showed that the region of space around the prereversal enhancement is consistent with ∇× E = 0, using the assumption that local time and longitude are equivalent.

Assuming a change of the electric field equal to 2 mV/m over a 2 h local time interval corresponding to a distance of about 3 × 10 6 m at the equator, ρ c ≈ 7 × 10 − 21 C / m 3 . This is less than one excess elemental charge per cubic meter, again illustrating how very small net charge densities can yield significant electric fields in a plasma. A schematic diagram based on the “charged terminator model” is given in Fig. 3.5 from the viewpoint of looking down on the earth from above the Northern Hemisphere. 3.2 The Equatorial F-Region Dynamo Before discussing the F-region dynamo, we need to understand a little about the thermospheric winds in the equatorial region, since they provide the source of energy that maintains the electric field. Early observational data on thermo- spheric winds came from studies of the drag exerted on artificial satellites by the neutral atmosphere (King-Hele, 1970). Analysis of such data shows that the change in satellite inclination is directly related to the angular velocity of the atmosphere with respect to the rotating earth. The surprising conclusion was that, on average, the low-latitude thermosphere superrotates; that is, there is a net eastward average zonal flow of about 150 m/s near 350 km altitude and about 50 m/s at 200 km altitude. The effect is most pronounced in the 2100–2400 local time period. Direct measurements of thermospheric winds are now avail- able at night using the Fabry-Perot technique to determine the Doppler shift of airglow emissions (Sipler and Biondi, 1978; Biondi et al., 1999). Some of these data (which were taken over Kwajalein in the Pacific Sector) are reproduced in Fig. 3.6a in the form of azimuth plots of the tip of a vector in the direction toward which the wind is blowing (note that at Kwajalein 8 UT is equal to 2000 LT)."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 77 (a) W S N 0 15 8 9 14 13 12 10 11 UT 16 E 200 m/s Aug. 20, 1977 50 2 50 W S N 0 14 8 9 13 12 10 100 11 UT 15 E 200 m/s Aug. 21, 1977 50 2 50 250 200 100 Eastward velocity (m/s) 50 0 00 04 08 12 16 20 (b) 24 150 2 150 2 100 2 50 Jicamarca plasma drift July 81–Feb. 83 DE-2 wind velocity 1978 1981 1970 1971 Local time (75 8 W) Figure 3.6 (a) Position of the tip of the neutral wind vector measured over Kwajalein as a function of universal time on August 20 and 21, 1977.

Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] (b) Comparison of the Jicamarca average drifts with thermospheric wind data from DE-2. [After Fejer et al. (1985). Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] Although the winds display a high degree of variability from day to day, to a first approximation the winds are eastward and quite strong ( ∼ 150 m/s) in the post- sunset period, decaying in amplitude to less than 50 m/s after midnight. More recent airglow observations in the Peruvian sector are in good agreement with these data (Meriwether et al., 1986). Airglow observations are restricted to nighttime, but satellite observations have yielded full 24 h coverage of the thermospheric winds (Wharton et al., 1984). Some of these data are presented in Fig. 3.6b, superimposed on the Jicamarca zonal plasma drift pattern. Both are clearly diurnal, with larger winds and plasma drifts occurring at night. There is a lot of scatter in the winds mea- sured by the satellite, but the pattern is unmistakable, as is its correlation with the plasma drifts. Setting aside the superrotation phenomenon for the moment, we can ask whether forcing due to solar heating of the thermosphere can explain the high winds observed in the postsunset period. Since the Coriolis force vanishes at the equator, in a steady state the winds should blow in the −∇ p direction from west to east across the sunset terminator. This pressure gradient is due to the subsolar neutral atmospheric temperature bulge that occurs on the sunward side of the earth. The problem is not so much the direction of the wind, which agrees with the data, but the magnitude of the theoretically calculated winds – the initial estimates of the wind speed were too high (Lindzen, 1966)."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"78 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Without a Coriolis term, the primary limitation on the wind speed comes from the various drag terms. If the plasma is ignored, as the early modelers naturally did, viscosity is the only frictional factor. As discussed in Chapter 2, in the lower atmosphere viscosity is provided by the interaction of eddies in the atmospheric flow—that is, by eddy viscosity. Above the turbopause, classical molecular viscosity becomes the dominant factor. An expression for the viscosity coefficient is given by η = 4 . 5 × 10 − 5 ( T / 1000 ) + 0 . 69 kg/m · s (3.4) where atomic oxygen has been assumed to be the dominant neutral (Dalgarno and Smith, 1962). This is a good approximation in the F region. The vertical tem- perature gradient is small in the upper thermosphere, and η is therefore virtually independent of height. However, when comparing viscosity with the accelera- tion terms such as F =− ( 1 /ρ) ∇ p , the kinematic viscosity (η/ρ) is what matters. Unlike η , this ratio increases exponentially with height as ρ decreases. This dras- tic increase of the ratio η/ρ is responsible for the importance of viscosity in the thermosphere. That a tenuous gas has a high viscosity seems counterintuitive, but what matters is the mean free path that carries velocity shear information from one height to another. A quantitative comparison between the various terms in the neutral momen- tum equation (2.21b) has been provided by Rishbeth (1972) and is reproduced in Fig. 3.7. The graph was constructed for 45 ◦ latitude, but all parameters (except for the Coriolis term) are applicable to the equatorial case. For now, we are interested in the curves labeled F and (η ̃ u /ρ H 2 ) . The former is the magnitude of the driving horizontal pressure gradient acceleration term and is deduced from neutral atmospheric measurements. The upper scale corresponds to F and is given in meters per second squared. Since F is inversely proportional to ρ ,it increases with height. Surprisingly, however, F increases only roughly linearly with height. To plot the viscous term, we need to scale it appropriately according to the form it takes in the momentum equation, (η/ρ) ∇ 2 U . We would not expect the winds to vary more quickly with altitude than the scale height H . Suppose the wind changed by ̃ u = 60 m/s over a scale height. The associated force is the order of η ̃ u /ρ H 2 and is plotted in Fig. 3.7. By 200 km it exceeds all of the other terms. Since the viscous term increases rapidly with height, it will eventually become large enough to suppress all variations of U with altitude. Therefore, most numerical models require that ∂ U /∂ z = 0 as an upper boundary condition. In his early study of thermospheric winds, Lindzen (1966) took the observed diurnal component of the pressure gradient given experimentally by Harris and Priester (1965) and solved the simplest form of the resulting zonal wind equation at equatorial latitudes: ∂ u /∂ t =− ( 1 /ρ ) \u0003 ∂ p /∂ x \u0004 + η ρ ∂ 2 u ∂ z 2 (3.5)"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 79 10 2 5 10 2 4 10 2 3 10 2 2 v ni and f (s 2 1 ) v ni 500 0.00 0.03 \u0002 u ~ / \u0003 H 2 and F (m/s 2 ) \u0002 u ~ f F 0.06 0.09 400 Height (km) 300 200 120 \u0003 H 2 Figure 3.7 Graphs of neutral acceleration time constants as well as viscous and pressure accelerations for midday at sunspot minimum.

The lower scale refers to the ion drag parameter, v ni (—), and the Coriolis parameter for a latitude of 45 ◦ , f (----). [After Rishbeth (1972). Reproduced with permission of Pergamon Press.] where u is the zonal component of the wind. He found an analytic solution to this equation by generating reasonable models for the functional variations of p and ρ with x and z . Even with a low estimate of the pressure term, however, zonal velocities of about 300 m/s were found in this analysis. In later work, Lindzen (1967) used a numerical solution with a more realistic pressure variation and found winds as high as 550 m/s! We leave this dilemma for the moment to deter- mine the electrodynamic effect of the observed and predicted postsunset zonally eastward thermospheric wind. Later we will show that including frictional drag on the neutrals by the ionospheric plasma explains the lower wind values that are actually observed. In the remainder of this chapter and in most of the next, we will slightly redefine our coordinate system to preserve the conventional notation that the a z axis is upward. At the equator, we thus take B =| B | a y , which is horizon- tal and northward, and take a x toward the east. The conductivity tensor is then σ = ⎛ ⎜ ⎝ σ P 0 σ H 0 σ 0 0 − σ H 0 σ P ⎞ ⎟ ⎠ (3.6)"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"80 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics In the F region σ P \u0007 σ H and the conductivity tensor is diagonal, although it still holds that σ P \b σ 0 . To a very good approximation, σ P = ne 2 ν in M \t 2 i in the F region. Assume first that the horizontal magnetic field lines extend for- ever or, equivalently, that they terminate at both ends in an insulating layer. In fact, the field lines bend and enter the E region, which has a finite conductivity that varies with local time, season, and solar activity. (We return to this point later.) The vertical component of the large-scale neutral wind field in the atmo- sphere is always small, so we consider a simple model in which the thermospheric wind is eastward and has a magnitude u that is uniform with height. In the text we use the meteorological notation in which U = ( u , v , w ) , where u , v , and w correspond to the zonal (positive eastward), meridional (positive northward), and upward components, respectively. From (2.41), an electric current will flow with magnitude and direction given by J \t σ · ( u a x × B ) The wind-driven current is therefore vertically upward with magnitude J z = σ P uB . The current J z is quite small with a peak value of the order of 0.01 μ A / m 2 . However, σ P varies considerably with altitude due to its dependence on the prod- uct n ν in . The zonal wind component, u , may also vary with height, but we assume for now that viscosity keeps this variation small. At any rate, d (σ P uB )/ dz = 0, and an electric field must build up in the z direction to produce a divergence-free current. However, the “insulating plates” we have assumed at the ends of the magnetic field lines do not allow a magnetic field-aligned current to flow at all (i.e., J y = 0 ) , so in this first approximation a stronger condition on J holds than the expression ∇· J = 0, namely, J = 0. A plasma density profile for the postsunset equatorial F layer is shown in Fig. 3.8a. As we noted in Section 2.2, gravitational forces do not cause the plasma (with large κ i , κ e ) to fall at the magnetic equator, since the velocity due to gravity is perpendicular to the gravitational force. Recombination “eats away” at the molecular ions on the bottomside, forming a steep upward-density gradient. The result is a dense O + plasma with a well-defined lower boundary. To study the electrodynamics of this region in a little more detail, we approximate the actual situation shown in Fig. 3.8a with the configuration illustrated in Fig. 3.8b, which shows a slab geometry with σ P constant inside the slab and zero elsewhere and with zonal wind u constant everywhere. Since the current is upward inside the layer and zero outside, charges pile up at the two boundaries as shown in the figure.

Furthermore, the electric field in the reference frame of the neutral wind, E \u000b = E + U × B , vanishes. This must be true because the current is independent of reference frame and we have set the current equal to zero—that is, since J = J \u000b = σ P E \u000b = 0, E \u000b must be zero. In this simple model there is a very strong shear in the plasma flow velocity at the two interfaces that is not shared by the driving neutral wind; that is, at the interfaces, the plasma velocity changes abruptly from u to 0. This “prediction” of a sheared plasma flow is intriguing, since such shears have been observed in the equatorial F-region and are discussed following. However, in this model the shear is created somewhat artificially by the slab conductivity assumption. The insulating end plate assumption made here is most nearly valid at night when the E-region molecular ion and electron pairs rapidly recombine with no offsetting production by sunlight (see, for example, Rishbeth and Garriott, 1969). The dominant O + (atomic) ions in the F layer are much longer lived and support the F-layer dynamo.

This observed nighttime plasma velocity is consis- tent in magnitude and direction with the eastward zonal neutral thermospheric wind found experimentally and discussed previously. The vertical pattern of the nighttime electric field is thus consistent with the simple F-region dynamo model we have presented. To understand the diurnal variation in more detail, however, we need to con- sider the role of the “end” plates in the E layer, which, contrary to the approxima- tion used previously, are good conductors during the day. First, consider again an idealized slab geometry that ignores the magnetic field line curvature and dip angle but includes conductivity variations with distance ( y ) along the magnetic field direction. The actual geometry is shown schematically in Fig. 3.9a, and the slab model is shown in Fig. 3.9b. There are no variations in the x direction. In this model the wind is a function of z in the F layer but goes to zero in the E layer. The finite density in the E layer and its attendant conductivity act as an electric load on the dynamo.

The current parallel to B now is nonzero and must be supplied by the dynamo and completed in the E layer. The full divergence equation must be used. First, as discussed in Chapter 2, we note that for large-scale dynamo sources, the magnetic field lines are nearly equipo- tentials due to the high ratio of σ 0 to σ P ( ≥ 10 5 ) . The electric field is thus mapped down to the E-region altitudes, where we have assumed that the neutral wind vanishes in order to study just the F-region dynamo. The ∇· J = 0 condition in the F region now yields d [ σ P ( E z + uB ) ] dz = − dJ y dy We now integrate this equation along the y direction from y = 0to y = y 1 , which corresponds to integrating from the equatorial plane to the base of the F layer in the Northern Hemisphere. By symmetry the contribution to the integral from the Southern Hemisphere is identical. Symmetry also requires that the field- aligned current vanish directly at the equator [ J y ( 0 ) = 0 ] , and the integral yields y 1 \u000f 0 d dz [ σ P ( E z + uB ) ] dy =− J y ( y 1 ) (3.8) Due to the low perpendicular conductivity in the “valley” between the E and F regions, the current we have just calculated, which leaves the F-region dynamo at y = y 1 , must be equal to the field-aligned current that enters the E region at y = y 2 . In the E layer we have only the (mapped) electric field, E z , to contend with because we have set the wind speed as u = 0 for now. Applying ∇· J = 0 yields d (σ P E z )/ dz =− dJ y / dy Integrating from y 2 to y 3 and requiring J y ( y 3 ) = 0—that is, an insulating atmo- sphere below y 3 —we have y 3 \u000f y 2 d dz (σ P E z ) dy = J y ( y 2 ) = J y ( y 1 ) (3.9) and, finally, using (3.8) and (3.9), y 1 \u000f 0 d dz \u0006 σ F P ( E z + uB ) \u0007 dy =− y 3 \u000f y 2 d dz \u0010 σ E PN E z \u0011 dy (3.10)"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"84 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Now E z is not a function of y (equipotential magnetic field lines), so if as a first approximation we take uB constant with y until the field line enters the F-layer valley, we can perform the y integrals in (3.10), giving d dz \u0012\u0013 1 2 F P + E PN \u0014 E z + 1 2 F P uB \u0015 = 0 where F P and E P are the field line–integrated conductivities discussed in Chapter 2.

Equation (3.11) clearly shows that if the off-equatorial E region is insulating \u0003 E P = 0 \u0004 , E ( z ) will be equal to − u ( z ) B everywhere. We can now use (3.11) to explain some aspects of the diurnal variation in the vertical electric field. Dur- ing the nighttime, E P becomes quite small and therefore E z ≈− uB in regions where F P is large—for example, near the peak in the F-region plasma density. During the daytime, however, the E-region conductivity is comparable to or larger than the magnetic field line–integrated F-region conductivity. For large E P the electrodynamic control of the ionosphere is vested in the E region. As discussed following, a dynamo operates there as well, but it is driven by daytime tidal winds, which are smaller than the thermospheric winds in the F region. This explains the diurnal variation in the F-region zonal plasma drifts plotted in Fig. 3.1. At night the E-region conductivity is low, and the high zonal winds at several hundred kilometers altitude determine the vertical electric field and thus the horizontal plasma flow. For F P \u0007 E P the electric field will be almost equal to uB . The eastward plasma velocity thus nearly matches the neutral wind speed. During the day, however, the F-region dynamo loses control of the elec- trodynamics, and the resulting electric fields are determined by winds in the E region. Since these winds tend to be weaker, the plasma drift is smaller during the day. Curiously, nighttime E-region winds measured by chemical releases are comparable to the F-region winds (see Chapter 5), but since E P is small, they do not seem to create large E-region dynamo electric fields. An analogous electric circuit is shown schematically in Fig. 3.10. The three batteries correspond to the two (north and south) E-region dynamos and the F-region dynamo.

Off-equatorial E-region wind dynamo competes with the F-region dynamo at the equator to determine the voltage differences between magnetic field lines. R = ( P ) − 1 . The voltage measured by the meter corresponds to the electric field times the distance between the two magnetic field lines (the conducting wires). The battery with the lowest internal resistance determines the voltage and thus the electric field as well. In the F layer during the nighttime F P is larger, and the F region dominates. During the day, E-region sources determine the electric field, and the F layer acts as a load. A model calculation of the field line–integrated Pedersen conductivity and the vertical electric field is presented in Fig. 3.11 as a function of height measured at the magnetic equator. The local time is 1900, and the driving eastward neutral wind used in the calculation is taken to be constant with a value of 160 m/s. The model used for the ionospheric plasma density is similar to the data plotted in Fig. 3.8a except that the E-region density below 150 km was taken to be constant at a value of 2 × 10 4 cm − 3 . The parenthetical expressions in the figure yield the percentage of the total P found below 300 km along that particular magnetic field line. At first glance the P values seem high, since the value of σ P at 300 km in Fig. 2.6 is only about 5 × 10 − 5 mho/m. However, near the equator the magnetic field lines are nearly horizontal and are the order of several thousand kilometers long. Large values of P then result. Notice that P continues to increase with height above the F peak at about 350 km, even though when measured at the magnetic equator, σ P decreases with height above 350 km. This is due to the length of the field line and to the fact that the field lines crossing the equator “reenter” the F layer at off-equatorial latitudes where the equatorial anomaly occurs (see Chapter 5). Above 400 km altitude, most of the conductivity is located in the F layer, and the local thermospheric winds drive the electrical system.

A considerable shear thus occurs in the plasma flow due to the rapid change in the driving electric field, even though the thermospheric wind was taken to be uniform with height. This detailed calculation is totally consistent with the simple model presented above. (Note that in Fig. 3.11 the electric field reverses sign at low altitude, since a tidal wind field was included in the E region.) Historically such a shear has been difficult to measure with an incoherent scat- ter radar, since it occurs where the plasma density decreases to values below the signal-to-noise threshold for plasma velocity measurements. The barium cloud technique can be used, however, and a number of experiments have been per- formed using sounding rockets. The results are summarized in Fig. 3.12a as a function of altitude and local time. The dashed line roughly indicates the base of the F layer. Below the F layer the plasma velocity is strongly westward. Thus, the downward electric field is not only reduced but also reversed in sign. Simul- taneous neutral wind measurements displayed velocities that were very different from the plasma velocities.

A possible explanation for the shear is a variation on the shorting effect just discussed.

This in turn will cause a westward plasma drift. However, the observed westward plasma drift velocity is higher than was expected for a wind-driven process in the 1980s. For example, the weak westward plasma drift at the base of the F layer in the calculation shown in Fig. 3.11 (indicated by the change in sign of the vertical electric field) was due to the theoretical E-region dynamo. The reversed field is much lower than the measured values, however. New measurements of neutral winds in the E region (see Chapter 5) show that high velocities do occur contrary to tidal theory. Thus, the E-region dynamo is likely much stronger than previously thought. Improved programs at Jicamarca have allowed direct ISR observations of the postsunset equatorial zone.

This shear most likely has an important role in the plasma physics described in Chapter 4. 3.3 E-Region Dynamo Theory and the Daytime Equatorial Electrojet To this point, we have discussed only the nighttime vertical equatorial electric field component associated with the F-region dynamo. During the daytime, the vertical field is controlled by the meridional electric field, which is generated by the global E-region dynamo we discuss next. The zonal electric field is generated in both daytime and nighttime by the E-region dynamo. Although the zonal com- ponent is small, it is very important because it causes the plasma to move verti- cally. This motion greatly affects the plasma density, since it causes the F-region plasma to interact with quite different neutral densities as it changes altitude, strongly affecting the recombination rate and, in turn, the plasma content. The zonal component of the electric field and the daytime vertical component are due primarily to winds in the E region. This E-region dynamo is driven by tidal oscillations of the atmosphere. An excellent book on this topic has been written by Chapman and Lindzen (1970), and we only touch on some aspects of tidal theory here. The largest atmospheric tides are the diurnal and semidiurnal tides driven by solar heating. The semidiurnal lunar gravitational tide is next in strength in the upper atmosphere. It is interesting to note that the lunar semidiurnal tide is the strongest in the case of ocean tides. One may legitimately question a terminology in which we discuss diurnal “tides” in the lower thermosphere (E region) but refer to a diurnal “wind” in the upper thermosphere (F region). The difference is that the tidal modes propagate into the lower thermosphere from below, whereas the upper thermospheric winds are driven by absorption of energy in the thermosphere itself. We could thus refer to the thermospheric response as being due to an in situ diurnal tide as opposed to a propagating tide, but we will stick with the traditional usage here. Tidal theory is quite complex. The equations of the neutral atmosphere must be solved on a rotating spherical shell subject to the earth’s gravitational field. Con- siderable insight is obtained by studying the free oscillations of the atmosphere— that is, the normal modes of the system. This is accomplished by reducing the set of equations to one second-order partial differential equation that is often written in terms of the divergence of the wind field. The resulting equation is sep- arable in terms of functions of latitude (θ) , longitude (φ) , altitude ( z ) , and time ( t ) . The longitude/time dependence is of the form exp[ i ( s φ + ft ) ] , where s must be an integer. For s = 0, the temporal behavior does not propagate with respect to the earth. For s = 1, the disturbance has one oscillation in longitude and propa- gates westward following the sun; this is the diurnal tide. The θ dependence can be expressed in terms of so-called Hough functions, which may be related to spherical harmonic functions."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"90 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics The height dependence of these normal modes is a crucial factor in tidal the- ory, since when forcing (e.g., solar heating) is included in the equations, the only modes excited are those having a vertical structure that matches the vertical struc- ture of the forcing. Although the mathematical models were well developed by 1900, controversy raged over the actual nature of atmospheric tides until defini- tive measurements of the temperature structure of the earth’s upper atmosphere became available from sounding rockets. The features of these temperature pro- files, which are of most relevance to tidal theory, are due to the absorption of sunlight by ozone in the stratosphere and by water vapor in the troposphere. When both the θ and z dependences of forcing functions and the normal modes are taken into account, many of the dominant features of tidal oscillations can be explained. For our purposes we summarize these features as follows: 1. As tidal oscillations propagate upward, the associated wind speed amplitude also grows up to F-region heights, where the amplitude becomes constant. (This ampli- fication is due to the decreasing density of the atmosphere and is a consequence of energy conservation. This important feature of vertical wave propagation is discussed in detail in Chapter 5, where gravity waves are studied.) 2. Diurnal tides can propagate vertically only below 30 ◦ latitude. At higher latitudes they remain trapped in the stratosphere. 3. With the decreasing importance of the diurnal tide, the semidiurnal tide becomes dominant at latitudes higher than 30 ◦ . Armed with this modest understanding of tidal theory, we may now investigate some aspects of the E-region dynamo. In the E region of the ionosphere, the conductivity tensor is not diagonal, and the Hall terms must also be considered. Furthermore, the electric field cannot be taken as being entirely self-generated by local wind fields, as we assumed for the nighttime F-layer dynamo. This can be understood as follows. The entire dayside ionosphere is a good electrical conductor in which currents are driven by lower thermospheric tides. The tidal E-region wind field U ( r , t ) is global in nature and will drive a global current system given by J w = σ ( r , t ) ·[ U ( r , t ) × B ] . Now, because both σ ( r , t ) and U ( r , t ) depend on r , the current J w is not, in general, divergence free. Thus, an electric field E ( r , t ) must build up such that the divergence of the total current is zero and ∇·[ σ ( E ( r , t ) + U ( r , t ) × B ) ]= 0 (3.12) The resulting E ( r , t ) is as rich and complex as the driving wind field and the conductivity pattern that produce it. The latter has a primarily diurnal variation over the earth’s surface, whereas the dominant tidal winds change from diurnal to semidiurnal, depending on latitude and altitude. As a first approximation we might then expect a diurnal electric field pattern at low latitudes and a mixture of diurnal and semidiurnal electric fields at higher latitudes. This crude analysis actually describes the situation fairly well."},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 91 90 255 228 60 30 0 2 30 2 60 2 90 00 03 06 09 Local time Dip latitude Sq currents 12 x 15 18 21 24 Figure 3.14 Average contours of vertical magnetic field in nT due to the Sq system mea- sured during the International Geophysical Year. [After Matsushita (1969). Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] The diurnal variations of the electric field components measured at Jicamarca have already been pointed out in Section 3.1. The global vertical magnetic pertur- bation pattern measured by ground-based magnetometers is shown in Fig. 3.14 and gives further evidence for this simple picture of the electric field. Such data have been used to construct the pattern of electrical currents in the entire iono- sphere that is referred to as the Sq current system. (S stands for solar and q for quiet in this notation.) As noted in Chapter 2, ground magnetometers respond primarily to horizontal Hall currents, since the magnetic field due to field-aligned currents is canceled out by the Pedersen currents that link the field lines horizon- tally through the ionosphere. Since the electric field must be nearly the same at both ends of a magnetic field line, any differences between the two hemispheres create currents that flow between the hemispheres to maintain the field lines as equipotentials. However, to first order, at equinox the tidal modes are symmet- rical and the field-aligned currents are therefore minimal. In this case the Sq pattern due to Hall currents represents the true total currents in the ionosphere quite well. Although the Sq current deduced from data such as those shown in Fig. 3.14 flows primarily on the dayside (where the conductivity is high), this does not mean that the electric field is confined to the dayside. In fact, the charge density that builds up at the terminators to force ∇· J = 0 creates the diurnal zonal electric field pattern observed at Jicamarca. In this chapter we consider the effect of the zonal electric field at the equator. The effect of the E-region dynamo at midlatitudes is discussed in Chapter 5.

More importantly, a vertically downward Hall current will also flow as shown in Fig. 3.16. Now from ∇· E = 0, we can deduce that ∂ E x /∂ z = ∂ E z /∂ x This means that the variation of the zonal component with altitude can be esti- mated by the ratio δ E x = δ E z (δ z /δ x ) The scale size (δ x ) of the horizontal conductivity pattern is 100 times that of the vertical (δ z ) variations of conductivity, whereas both experiments and theory indicate E z is at most 10–20 times E x . Taken together, this means that the zonal electric field can change only slightly in the E region. The data presented in Fig. 3.17b verify this argument, and we will thus assume that conductivity gradients rather than variations in E x dominate the divergence of the vertical Hall current. Figure 3.15 shows that the Hall conductivity dominates below 120 km and, indeed, is highly altitude dependent (i.e., a slablike geometry is appropriate). As a first approximation to the physics of the E-region dynamo, we again consider a slab conductivity geometry such as that illustrated in Fig. 3.16, subject to a constant zonal electric field.

Notice that the local neutral wind does not enter this calculation at all; the electrojet is set up by the global tidal winds that create the diurnal zonal electric field component measured at the equator. In a more complete theory, complications due to the zonal neutral wind may be included, since it will drive an ion current equal to u. Note that the meridional wind component does not enter at the magnetic equator as a local dynamo, since for that component the cross product with the magnetic field vanishes. In effect, (3.14ab) shows that the zonal conductivity is enhanced by the large factor 1 + σ 2 H /σ 2 P , the Cowling conductivity factor, which leads to the intense current jet at the magnetic equator. This can be seen in Fig. 3.14, in which the magnetic field contours become very close together at the magnetic equator. This channel of electrical current is termed the equatorial electrojet. The Cowling conductivity is also plotted in Fig. 3.15 (divided by 100) and displays a peak at 102 km with a half-width of 8 km. There have been many rocket measurements of the magnetic field due to the electrojet current. Some of the data are reproduced here in Fig. 3.17a. The plot displays the altitude variation of the jet over Peru with each profile normalized to a 100 nT variation of the magnetic field measured on the ground at Huancayo, Peru; that is, the actual perturbed magnetic field at Huancayo during each rocket flight was used to scale all data to a common ground perturbation of 100 nT.

As discussed in detail in the next chapter, these fields create electron drifts that are unstable to the generation of plasma waves. Peak vertical electric fields in the range 10–20 mV/m have been predicted theoretically and would create electron drift speeds of 350–700 m/s. This exceeds the acoustic speed C s , which is about 360 m/s, and leads to the generation of intense plasma waves via the two-stream instability. Indeed, as we shall see, very large Doppler shifts occur when radar signals are scattered from the electrojet waves. These observations show that the vertical electric field reaches values at least as large as that given by E z = C s B \t 9 mV/m at the very threshold of the two-stream instability, and it is very likely that the field reaches values half again as large. This is the largest electric field found in the ionosphere below subauroral zone latitudes. Remarkably, the data in Fig. 3.17a are the only vertical electric field measurements ever made. The measurements in panels (a–c) have been combined in the right-hand panel to show the differential (net current) velocity as well as the E × B drift speed. At high altitudes the agreement is quite good, but below 104 km there is a systematic difference. As discussed in Chapter 2, neutral winds in the E region carry the ions with them but barely affect the electrons at all. The systematic difference between the two curves in panel d suggests that a high, westward neutral wind may have been present, a result in agreement with TMA measurements made in the evening two days later (Larsen and Odom, 1997). Notice that the measured current density in Fig. 3.17a field peaks almost 5 km above the theoretical curve. This has been a mystery ever since Gagnepain et al. (1977). A fix can be made by arbitrarily quadrupling the electron-ion col- lision frequency. This approach works for horizontal magnetic field measure- ments as well (P. Alken, personal communication, 2008). However, Ilma and Kelley (2009) have shown that merely by evaluating the field line–integrated conductivity and using it to calibrate the current, the problem goes away. As in the F region, this is due to the increasing length of the line integral as a func- tion of altitude. This effect is classical but for zonal electric fields larger than 1 mV/m, plasma waves “anomalously” decrease the conductivity (Kelley et al., 2009b). An electrojet theory suitable for comparison with such detailed data must include realistic altitude and latitude variations of σ . Away from the equator, σ is often expressed in geographic rather than geomagnetic coordinates, and the resulting conductivity tensor is not as simple as (3.6). If R is the rotation matrix relating geographic and geomagnetic coordinates, we have R · J = R · ( σ · E \u0002 ) where E \u000b = E + U × B .

It is impor- tant to note that assuming E \u0002 = E + U × B to be independent of height implies that u , ν , and −∇ φ are all independent of height, which is not very realistic. Nonetheless, comparisons between the electrojet currents obtained using thin- shell theory and experimentally measured currents have been made by treating the zonal electric field as a free parameter (e.g., Sugiura and Cain, 1966; Untiedt, 1967) and by solving the dynamo equation by setting the zonal derivatives equal to zero. However, the peak current density seems to be underestimated in these models, and details concerning the vertical and latitudinal extent of the electro- jet are not reproduced. More seriously, without vertical currents at the equator, which are suppressed by the thin-shell model, it is very hard to satisfy the diver- gence requirement ∂ J λ ∂λ + ∂ J θ ∂θ = 0 since the electrojet varies rapidly in latitude but only slowly in longitude. Forbes and Lindzen (1976) pointed out that allowing a vertical current could actually increase the electrojet intensity predicted by the models. For example, returning to the current equation at the equator and again ignoring the neutral wind, J x = σ P E x + σ H E z J z =− σ H E x + σ P E z Eliminating E z yields J x = σ c E x + ( σ H /σ P ) J z (3.20) Thus, if J z is nonzero and positive at the equator, J x would exceed the Cowling current and the electrojet current would be stronger than σ c E x . More realistic models that include such possibilities have been developed by Richmond (1973a, b; see Fig. 3.17a) and Forbes and Lindzen (1976). Richmond’s improvement over the thin-shell model involved integrating the divergence equa- tion along a magnetic field line as discussed above for the F-layer dynamo. The zonal derivatives were all set to zero. The vertical electric field at the equator then becomes ( H / P ) E x rather than (σ H /σ P ) E x ; that is, the integrated conductivi- ties along the field line are used rather than the local values. Above 100 km the integrated conductivity ratio exceeds the local value so J z = 0 and both the east- ward current and the vertical electric field are greater than the thin-shell model. The result seems to overestimate the current (see Fig. 3.17a). Forbes and Lindzen (1976) relaxed the requirement of zonal invariance in their solution of the three- dimensional ∇· J = 0 equation, but they did not include integration along B ."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 99 The excellent review by Forbes (1981) details these and other electrojet studies, including day-to-day variability, neutral wind, and lunar tidal effects that are beyond the scope of the present text. 3.4 Further Complexities of Equatorial Electrodynamics The simple E- and F-region dynamos just described explain some of the observa- tions presented earlier in Fig. 3.1. Since the E region controls the physics during the day, the small daytime vertical electric fields in the F region presumably mir- ror the meridional E-region polarization fields in the latitude ranges just north and south of the equator. The zonal field, both daytime and nighttime, is global in nature and is driven by the large-scale tides and winds in the sunlit hemisphere. In the postsunset period, the F-layer vertical field is enhanced due to the local F-layer dynamo previously discussed. In the next paragraphs we point out some of the features not explained by these simple models. 3.4.1 The Prereversal Enhancement The postsunset enhancement or prereversal enhancement of the zonal field occurs during all epochs and seasons studied except for the solar minimum solstices. The effect of this brief duration, large eastward electric field can be quite significant since the F-layer plasma often is driven to very high altitudes where recombina- tion is slight and collisions are rare. Heelis et al. (1974) successfully predicted the postsunset effect in their model, which included horizontal conductivity gra- dients near sunset in the F-layer dynamo mechanism (in addition to the vertical gradients we have studied). In effect, near such a sharp east-west gradient, an enhanced zonal electric field is established to keep ∇· J = 0. Experimental data support this explanation since the enhancement begins when the sun sets on either of the E layers in contact along B with the equatorial F region. The evidence from their numerical simulation is presented in Fig. 3.18. The solid line shows the calculated vertical ion velocity in the F region (equivalent to a zonal electric field) when only a diurnal E-region tidal mode is considered. The basic day-night features are reproduced, but no prereversal enhancement occurs. The dashed line shows a calculation including the F-region dynamo in the physics. The latter agrees quite well with the dotted line, which is a typical vertical drift profile for the plasma over Jicamarca. The prereversal enhancement has been successfully simulated for the first time by a general circulation model, the National Center for Atmospheric Research thermosphere/ionosphere/electrodynamic general circulation model (TIEGCM; Fesen et al., 2000). The TIEGCM reproduces the zonal and vertical plasma drifts for equinox, June, and December for low, medium, and high solar activity. The crucial parameter in the model needed to produce the prereversal enhancement (PRE) is the nighttime E-region electron densities; densities greater than 10 4 cm − 3"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"100 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Local time (hrs) Vertical ion velocity (ms 2 1 ) 2 60 2 40 2 20 0 20 40 60 00 06 12 18 24 Figure 3.18 Calculated vertical ion drift velocities for several driving wind components.

The E-region semidiurnal 2,2 tidal wave largely determines the magnitude and phase of the daytime F region drifts in this model (see Fig. 3.19). A simple sketch that may explain the prereversal enhancement is given in Fig. 3.20. The equatorial plane is shown here as a vertical plane, and its projection onto the Southern Hemisphere along B is also shown. The wind blows across the terminator, generating a vertical electric field, E z , which is downward on both sides of the terminator. E z is much smaller on the dayside than on the nightside due to the shorting effect, but it is never zero. Thus, E z maps along B to an equatorward electric field component off the equator. This field drives a westward Hall current J θφ on both sides of the terminator. However, even though E z is smaller on the dayside by up to 90%, the Hall conductivity is more than 10 times the nighttime value. The result is that a negative charge density builds up near the terminator, creating the localized zonal E φ perturbation (the PRE) shown in the figure. Using the notation of Farley et al. (1986), the current J φφ cancels J θφ in a steady state. The absence of a sunrise enhancement may be due to the lower value of E z , which occurs on the nightside of the dawn terminator relative to the nightside of the dusk terminator as well as the lower conductivities that occur in the predawn F region. Another idea is that the equatorial electrojet partially closes with a current through the postsunset F-layer valley. With the low conductivity in this region, both an eastward and an upward E field would result. This could explain both the prereversal enhancement and westward flows seen"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 101 Equinox Observations Vertical ion drifts 2 40 2 20 0 85 150 F10.7 200 20 40 06 10 14 18 22 02 06 TIEGCM results 2 40 2 20 0 20 40 June 2 40 2 20 0 20 40 2 40 2 20 0 20 40 06 10 14 18 22 02 06 December 2 40 2 20 0 20 40 2 40 2 20 0 20 40 Zonal ion drifts Equinox Velocity (m/s) Velocity (m/s) LT 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 LT June 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 06 10 14 18 22 02 06 06 10 14 18 22 02 06 December No data for F10.7 200 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 Figure 3.19 Ion drifts at Jicamarca averaged over heights from 300 to 400 km as a func- tion of season and solar activity.

On the other hand, Eccles (1998a, b) pointed out that simply setting ∇ × E = 0 will generate a zonal electric field pulse due to the spatial variation of the vertical component. A third mechanism by Haerendel and Eccles (1992) suggests that the electrojet partially closes after sunset through a poorly conducting F-region valley, creating electric fields. After studying a counterelectrojet event that produced a reversed sign of the PRE, Kelley et al. (2009a) concluded that the Haerendel/Eccles mechanism must dominate. As we shall see, this vertical drift enhancement has many interesting conse- quences. It can produce conditions that are favorable to plasma instabilities, and an extremely structured ionosphere often results (see Chapter 4). Significant effects on neutral atmospheric dynamics also occur. 3.4.2 High-Latitude Effects on the Equatorial Electric Field The equatorial plasma is not always as well behaved as indicated thus far. A number of interesting processes can affect equatorial electrodynamics, in addi- tion to the neutral wind-generated electric fields already discussed, which are driven by the solar heat input carried by photons. Energy also comes from the sun via particles in the solar wind and via the electromagnetic (Poynting) flux in the solar wind. These energy sources affect primarily the high-latitude polar"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 103 cap and auroral zones but can also be detected at the equator. The sensitivity of radars to electric fields has, in fact, increased our knowledge of how the solar wind affects the magnetosphere/ionosphere system (Gonzales et al., 1979, 1983; Somayajulu et al., 1985, 1987; Earle and Kelley, 1987). A classical event (Nishida, 1968) illustrating a clear relationship between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF), which is of solar origin, and the magnetic field created by the equatorial electrojet is reproduced in Fig. 3.21. The two magnetic field measurements are clearly correlated, although the magnetometers were separated by 10 5 km! Thus, although the magnetosphere, ring current, and plasmasphere all act to shield out interplanetary and solar wind effects from low latitudes, the protection is not perfect. Some insight into the complex relationship between interplanetary and equatorial ionospheric phenomena has come from simultaneous measurements of electric fields at Jicamarca and in the auroral zone. Since, as discussed elsewhere in this text, the much shorter chain of cause and effect between the IMF and auroral fields is itself not yet entirely understood, we can be satisfied here with some plausible explanations for the equatorial effects. Forty-eight hours of Jicamarca electric field data are presented in the lower panel of Fig. 3.22. The eastward electric field component is plotted along with a lighter line that shows the average quiet-day value for the same solar cycle con- ditions and season.

One of these data gaps occurred during the first isolated substorm, and we ignore this period for the moment. The IMF turned southward at 1700 UT on January 18 and remained southward until about 0100 UT on January 19. During this time two substorms occurred in the auroral oval. At Jicamarca, which was in the postnoon sector, the period 1900–2300 UT was characterized by a westward perturbation from the quiet-time field. This period corresponds to the time between the two substorms. The period 0700–1200 UT on January 19 also fell between two substorms but was characterized by an east- ward perturbation of the Jicamarca electric field measurement (postmidnight sector). Notice that there was almost exactly 12 h between these events, which means that the Jicamarca data were taken on the opposite side of the system when viewed in a magnetospheric or solar wind reference frame.

These eastward perturbations in the postmidnight sector are very commonly reported in the various studies of dis- turbance fields using the Jicamarca data base. In part, this is due to the fact that they are easily recognizable in that sector since the quiet-time field is usually steady and westward. (Notice, for example, that the July 3, 1968, event identi- fied in Fig. 3.3 is of this type.) A local time dependence may exist due to the ion conductivity postmidnight, which leads to enhanced perturbations in this sector. The westward perturbation in the daytime Jicamarca data (1700–2400 UT on Jan. 18) is now also interpreted as the same (between substorm) type of event viewed on the opposite side of the system. The transition in sign is clearly seen at 0 UT (1900 LT) when B z turned north: substorm activity ceased and Jicamarca recorded an eastward perturbation. Another event of this class is shown in Fig. 3.23. The shaded period is char- acterized as follows: 1. The IMF turned northward (panel 2) and magnetic activity decreased (panel 1). 2. The auroral zone electric field measured over Alaska (Chatanika data) and eastern Canada (Millstone Hill) decreased dramatically. 3. An eastward electric field perturbation occurred in the postmidnight sector over Peru (Jicamarca data). A qualitative explanation for such events was proposed by Kelley et al. (1979). As we will discuss in more detail in subsequent chapters, it is known that if a steady magnetospheric electric field exists, divergence of the ring current near L = 4 will eventually create a charge separation in such a way that the magneto- spheric electric field will be shielded from low latitudes. This charge separation region is called the Alfvén layer (Vasyliunas, 1972). Now if the magnetospheric field rapidly increases or decreases, the charges will be temporarily out of balance with the new configuration, and a brief low-latitude disturbance will result. An example of the effect of a rapid decrease in the external electric field is illustrated in Fig. 3.24a. The transient state inside the plasmasphere when the external field vanishes is an eastward perturbation on the nightside and a westward perturba- tion during the day, just as observed in the data shown in Figs. 3.22 and 3.23. In other words, the low-latitude electric field may be due to Alfvén layer charges that still exist, even though no external field is left in the outer regions to shield out! In circuit terminology, the finite inductance of the ring current maintains the voltage in the inner region when the source is turned off. This effect is also called overshielding. Perhaps a better way to understand these penetrating electric fields is illustrated in Fig. 3.24b. Here the physics is described by a current source rather than a voltage source. In the middle panel we illustrate the dayside voltage response to enhanced Region 1 (high latitude) currents (increasing magnetic activity) and at the bottom we illustrate the opposite effect when Region 2 (low latitude) currents exceed those in Region 1, which occurs when the solar wind–magnetosphere"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"106 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics April 14, 1978 AU AL B z (SM) Chatanika E N Chatanika E E Millstone E N Millstone E E Jicamarca E E 500 0 2 500 5 20 0 0 0 5 0.5 0 0 mv/m mv/m mv/m mv/m mv/m Gammas Gammas 20 15 0 2 5 2 20 2 20 2 15 2 5 2 0.5 00 04 08 12 UT 16 20 24 Figure 3.23 Auroral (AU, AL) and interplanetary ( B z ) magnetic field data along with auroral (Chatanika and Millstone) and equatorial (Jicamarca) electric field measurements.

The same anticorrelation on opposite sides of the earth was shown recently by Kelley et al. (2007). The anticorrelation of Indian poleward magnetic field and Peruvian eastward electric field data shows that when the electric field perturbation is east- ward at night it is westward during the day. Control of the earth’s low-latitude electric field from hundreds of thousands of kilometers away in the interplanetary medium is indeed remarkable.

The power is down by only a factor of four at Jicamarca, which means the field penetrating to the equator in Fig. 3.25b is reduced by only 50% from the magnetospheric (auroral zone) value in the equatorial plane. This is typical of the electric field values in the few-hour frequency range stud- ied by Earle and Kelley (1987), who also have reported experimental evidence that the shielding process acts like a high-pass filter, allowing signals with peri- ods shorter than about8htopenetrate to the equatorial ionosphere. This is in good agreement with the time constant predicted by ring current shielding theory (Vasyliunas, 1972). Furthermore, they show that for the zonal electric field com- ponent at Jicamarca, the signal in the frequency range corresponding to a period of a few hours exceeds the “geophysical noise” due to gravity waves at a mod- erate level of magnetic activity ( K p = 3). In other words, at frequencies above the ring current shielding frequency, high-latitude effects may always be present at all latitudes but cannot be detected unless they are above the fluctuation level (geophysical noise) due to neutral wind-driven electric fields. Examples of the low-latitude effect of increasing magnetospheric electric fields are rare for reasons that are not altogether clear. One good example on March 23–24, 1971, is shown in Fig. 3.26a. The IMF turned southward abruptly at 0700 UT on March 24 after 5 hours of northward field. A strong westward perturbation occurred over Jicamarca, which was in the postmidnight sector. Notice that on the next day the more common eastward perturbation was seen in conjunction with a northward turning of the IMF at 0900 UT. There is an unfortunate data gap, but it does seem that a westward electric field perturbation occurred in conjunction with the B z south event at 0500 UT on the 25th. One of the best documented events (Kelley et al., 2003a) occurred on April 17, 2002. For example, Fig. 3.26b directly compares the interplanetary electric field (IEF) in the upper panel to the electric field measured with the incoherent scatter radar (middle panel). The IEF has been divided by 15 before plotting in the middle panel and is highly correlated with the equatorial field at Jicamarca. Gonzales et al. (1979) and more recently Anderson et al. (2002) developed a technique using magnetic field data from two sites—one on and one off the equator—which has promise for greatly improving our knowledge of the electric field. A direct comparison of the Anderson-Gonzales method with the measured electric field is shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3.26b and is very convincing. Not shown is a good correlation between the Jicamarca electric field and that measured at Sondre Stromfjord (Kelley et al., 2003b). Fejer and Scherliess (1995) created a semi-empirical model and compared it with the Rice Convection model, which includes both Region 1 and Region 2 cur- rents. The former corresponds to the highest latitude currents, which are closely controlled by and linked to the solar wind generator. The Region 2 currents cor- respond to the inner magnetospheric portion of the auroral current system and link up with the ring current system. Their results are shown in Fig. 3.27 for an increase in the Region 1 current without a corresponding Region 2 current, corre- sponding to increased polar cap convection.

These conditions are illustrated in Fig. 3.24b. This work has continued, as described by Scherliess and Fejer (1997) and Fejer and Scherliess (1997). Another mechanism that creates low-latitude electrodynamic changes is called a disturbance dynamo. If auroral zone heating and momentum sources are suf- ficiently strong, the low-latitude neutral atmospheric winds can also be affected. In turn, these winds will create different electric field patterns through the usual E- and F-region dynamo process. Unlike the virtually instantaneous changes shown previously, the disturbance dynamo takes more time to develop and lags the auroral inputs by many hours. Gravity waves can also be generated by high-latitude processes and propagate to low latitudes.

In each of the latter plots the mean field pattern is shown as the solid line. The abrupt change in the Jicamarca field between 2300 and 0300 local time on August 8/9 has been studied by Gonzales et al. (1979) and has a waveform identical to that of the electric field measured simultaneously at Chatanika, Alaska. (See also Fig. 3.25a for identical auroral and equatorial waveforms.) This is a clear case of rapid penetration of high-latitude electric fields to low latitudes. On the next day the Jicamarca zonal field component displayed a long-lived deviation from the average, commencing at 2200 local time and lasting for 8 h. Fejer et al. (1983) argue that such slowly developing, delayed electric field changes are due to a worldwide change in the thermosphere winds. These changes alter the E region and equatorial F-region dynamo and thereby change the electric field at low latitudes from the normal pattern. Taken together, we see that these and other high-latitude effects contribute to the “weather” in the low-latitude electric field and neutral wind patterns. Their study therefore yields information on both high- and low-latitude phenomena. Much can be learned about global electrodynamics and thermospheric physics through events of these types. The true test of global electrodynamic model calcu- lations may be their ability to predict the low-latitude ionospheric effects of such diverse external influences. Such studies are well under way (Maruyama et al., 2005). In Chapter 5 we discuss further the penetration of high-latitude electric fields to midlatitudes.

Part of the key to this dilemma lies in the crucial role of the plasma in controlling the thermospheric wind, even though the ionized component is only a very minor constituent (one part in 10 3 at 300 km). When a moving neutral particle strikes an ionized particle at rest in the thermosphere, some of the momentum imparted is converted into motion of the particle about the magnetic field and yields a net deflection in the q ( U × B ) direction, where q includes the sign of the particle charge. Thus, unlike a collision with a neutral particle, the momentum transfer does not appear as linear momentum parallel to U in the ionized gas. A similarly dense minor neutral species would, after one or two collisions, merely accelerate to a velocity equal to the background wind"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"114 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics speed, at which time no further momentum transfer would occur. The ionized particles, however, are “locked” onto the magnetic field lines instead of being accelerated parallel to U and can act as a steady drag on the neutral wind. We now show that the linear momentum lost per unit time by the neutral fluid due to this drag is equal to the electromagnetic force F E = J × B due to the wind- generated electric current flowing in the fluid. As shown in Chapter 2, the current due to a neutral wind U is given by J = σ · \u0003 U × B \u0004 with σ = ⎛ ⎝ σ P 00 0 σ 0 0 00 σ P ⎞ ⎠ being the appropriate tensor for an equatorial F-region process with B in the ˆ a y direction. Since σ is diagonal and U × B is perpendicular to B , the triple cross product in J × B yields F E =− σ P B 2 U ⊥ (3.21) where U ⊥ is the projection of the wind vector onto the plane perpendicular to B . The plasma thus clearly acts as a drag on the neutrals, since the force acts in the opposite direction to U ⊥ . We have shown previously that in the F region we can approximate σ P by the expression σ P = \u0010 ne 2 v in / M \t 2 i \u0011 = nv in M / B 2 (3.22) where n is the plasma density, M the ion mass, \t i the ion gyrofrequency, and v in the ion-neutral collision frequency. Substituting (3.22) into (3.21) yields F E =− nMv in U ⊥ (3.23) which even more clearly shows the draglike nature of the J × B force. At first glance this expression has the form of a frictional or drag force, F D , on the wind, but it is not quite right, since it should include the neutral density, not the plasma density, if it is to be inserted into the Navier Stokes equation; that is, it should be of the form F D =− n n Mv ni U ⊥ However, for equal-mass ions and neutrals, it follows that the collision frequen- cies for momentum transfer are related by n n v ni = n i v in = nv in"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 115 and the two expressions for F E and F D are seen to agree with each other. In the preceding last term, we have simply noted that n i = n , the plasma density. Referring back to Fig. 3.7, we may now interpret the parameters ν ni and f . The solid curve is ν ni , the daytime neutral-ion collision frequency, and the vertical dotted line is the Coriolis parameter, f = \t sin θ , evaluated for 45 ◦ latitude. (Here \t is the rotation frequency of the earth, 7 . 35 × 10 − 4 rad/s.) The latter plays no role at the equator but the drag term does. For example, consider the steady-state solution to d U / dt =− ( 1 /ρ ) ∇ p − v ni U = F − v ni U which is given by U =− F / v ni where typical values for F are also plotted in Fig. 3.7. Near the F-layer plasma density peak at 250 km the equation yields a magnitude for U of only about 70 m/s. At 300 km the velocity rises to about 130 m/s. These values are much more reasonable than those found by Lindzen (1966) without ion drag and show that the ionosphere has great control over the neutral atmosphere. In summary, the J × B force on the plasma is transferred to the neutral gas by collisions. As discussed earlier, vertical wind variations are suppressed by viscosity in the middle and upper thermosphere. There is an interesting and important day-night asymmetry to the drag term due to the nighttime F-region dynamo. During the day, the F-region dynamo is shorted out by the E layer and the plasma cannot move along with the wind. Thus, the thermospheric wind blows through ions that are tied to the magnetic field lines. Collisions between neutrals and the “immovable” ions create the drag. But at night, the plasma tends to catch up to the neutrals, and the drag becomes small. Alternatively, we could argue that J = E + U × B becomes small and, in any case, the wind can accelerate. Given the control exhibited by the ionospheric plasma on the thermosphere, it is not surprising that the winds are so variable. In addition to the F-layer dynamo and the effect of the vertical electric fields, another factor is the altitude of the nighttime ionospheric plasma layer, which is determined by the magnitude of the zonal component of the electric field. Anderson and Roble (1974) have calculated zonal neutral wind contours in conjunction with an empirical model of the electric field pattern for the two cases illustrated in Fig. 3.29. In the upper plot a diurnally varying electric field pattern is used that is typical of sunspot minimum conditions, while the lower plot includes the prereversal enhancement of the electric field, which is largest during sunspot maximum. In the latter case the ionospheric plasma is driven to very high altitudes in the 2000–2400 LT sector. With the plasma out of the way, the ion drag is greatly reduced and the thermospheric wind speed nearly doubles.

A thermospheric model has been run by Sipler et al. (1983), who used it as a diagnostic tool in a numerical experiment to determine which processes dominate the wind variability. The measurements and model calculations of the wind are plotted in Fig. 3.31. In this study, the thermospheric general circulation model (TGCM) was run for August 21, 1978, and compared to the measured winds indicated by the heavy dashed line in Fig. 3.31. Then the lower atmospheric tides were added along with the high-latitude influence (light dashed line). Finally, ionospheric electric fields were added (dotted line). The conclusion was that the day-to-day variability was tied most closely to the tidal and electric field effects but that even in relatively quiet conditions the high-latitude plasma circulation played a role in the equatorial winds. Finally, we return to the curious fact that the earth’s upper atmosphere super- rotates—that is, the mean zonal wind in the rotating frame is eastward in the equatorial zone. A number of explanations have been put forth concerning this effect (e.g., the review by Rishbeth, 1972). Since a high eastward velocity is most common in the sunset-to-midnight period, theories that control the ther- mospheric winds via the ionospheric drag effect look very promising, since in this period the winds are the least opposed by the ionosphere. This happens for two reasons.

Most of what we know about dynamics comes from rocket and radio wave techniques but more recently, lidars have become practiced. Meteor radars use the drift of meteor trails to accumulate line-of-sight velocities over some suitable period of time and convert them to vector winds. MF (medium frequency) radars use partial reflections from the D-layer structures seen in Fig. 1.7a, b to determine the winds. Large incoherent scatter radars can be used in the daytime, but it is not practical to use this technique for climatological studies. In Chapter 1 a representative temperature profile was presented for the earth’s atmosphere. Below about 60 km the temperature at a given height stays within"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"120 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics a rather narrow range due to the huge thermal inertia in the system. Above this height the situation is quite different. In the extreme case of the upper atmosphere discussed already in this chapter, the temperature can vary by nearly 500 K in a single day. Naturally, huge diurnal tides surge across the system from night to day, leading to the 200 m/s (720 km/hr) winds observed. This type of wind field is termed an in situ tide, since it is generated and detected where it is created: in the thermosphere. Propagating tides usually are only easily detectable after they increase in amplitude by propagating upward into regions of low atmospheric density and are first evident in the lower thermosphere. A sample analysis of two years of data from the MF radar on Kauai, Hawaii, is presented in Fig. 3.32. Here we see many interesting wave modes, including planetary waves at 2- to 10-day periods, diurnal (S1) and semidiurnal (S2) tides, and even evidence for S3 and S4 tides. Humphreys et al. (2005) have shown that S1 through S6 tides are generated in the troposphere using GPS techniques. There is concern that some contamination occurs in the MF data at high frequencies and high altitudes ( > 85 km) due to gravity wave phase velocity detection (rather than winds). But for tidal frequencies and lower, there is general acceptance of these results. We postpone for now a discussion of atmospheric waves in these high-fre- quency regimes, usually referred to as gravity waves, but we must point out 10 2 8 10 2 7 10 2 6 10 2 5 10 2 4 10 2 3 10 2 2 Frequency (Hz) 10 10 10 9 10 8 10 7 10 6 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 10 10 9 10 8 10 7 10 6 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 10 2 2 10 2 3 Period (days) PSD (m/s) 2 /Hz Figure 3.32 Frequency spectral of zonal (solid) and meridional (dashed) velocities in standard form for a two-year data set obtained with the Hawaii MF radar.

Upward- propagating tides have the same property, so quite substantial winds can occur in the upper atmosphere. A plot of the wind field determined from a rocket trail measurement is presented in Fig. 3.33. The data were obtained from one of the several hundred trail observations made since 1960. Tri-methyl aluminum (TMA) is the chemical of choice, since it burns in the rich atomic oxygen envi- ronment for several tens of minutes. Using triangulation, the winds can be mea- sured as a function of altitude from 80 to 130 km. These large winds are typical of TMA observations over the years (Larsen, 2002) and represent a problem for theoreticians: Such large values are not predicted by the models. Observations such as those presented in Fig. 3.33 indicating 100 m/s winds in the lower thermosphere are quite remarkable and are not as yet explainable by tidal theory. We postpone discussion of these ubiquitous high winds until our discussion of gravity waves in Chapter 6. These large winds are accom- panied by large shears, shears large enough to be dynamically unstable to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We investigate this neutral atmospheric process in Chapters 4 and 6 because it leads to turbulence and small-scale structure in both the atmosphere and the ionosphere. Such effects are likely to occur at all lati- tudes, but very few equatorial observations exist at this point. We thus postpone discussion of the winds to later chapters. These high winds have, for the most part, been ignored by theorists and experimentalists, but the data in Fig. 3.33 suggest that this is not a good idea! Also, considering Fig. 3.17b, classic electrojet theory would yield J / ne =| E / B | , but this is clearly not the case.

A westward wind of over 100 m/s is required by the data in Fig. 3.17b. The winds cannot be measured during the day using the TMA method, but two days after these data were taken, the wind speeds measured just after sunset were of this magnitude (Larsen and Odom, 1997). At still lower levels, a very interesting feature of the mesospheric temperature field is shown in Fig. 3.34. This solstice view of the earth’s atmospheric tempera- ture shows the curious feature that the polar summer mesosphere, in full sunlight for 24 hours a day, is nearly 100 K colder than its winter counterpart (Geller, 1983). Radiative equilibrium theory predicts just the opposite, and the expla- nation must involve a dynamic effect. This too requires a discussion of gravity waves and their profound effect on the system, and we revisit the polar summer mesosphere in detail in Chapter 7. 3.6.2 A Primer on Turbulence and the Turbopause Neutral turbulence has been studied for many years in both the atmosphere and the laboratory. The crucial parameter is the Reynolds number, which is a measure of the importance of the different terms in the momentum equation. The momentum equation, also called the Navier-Stokes equation, for a neutral gas (ignoring gravity) is ρ (∂ U ) ∂ t + ( U ·∇ )ρ U =−∇ p + η ∇ 2 U If we compare the second and fourth terms we get ρ | U | 2 L : η | U | L 2 Their ratio yields the Reynolds number R = | U | L ν where ν = η/ρ is the kinematic viscosity. In the atmosphere L is quite large (com- pared to the laboratory), and high Reynolds numbers are common ( R ≥ 1000). In laboratory experiments energy is generated at some scale by, for exam- ple, flowing through a grid. The eddies generated at the grid scale ( L ) generate smaller-scale waves in the inertial subrange where energy is passed from scale to scale without losses. Ultimately, a scale is eventually reached at which viscosity damps out the structure. That this must occur at small scales can be understood from the viscosity term (η/ρ) ∇ 2 U .

The buoyancy subrange drives the inertial subrange and eventually energy reaches the viscous damping range. The buoy- ancy scale L B is determined by convection scales or gravity wavelengths. At small wavelengths, the Kolmogorov microscale μ is a measure of the breakpoint to a very steep slope in the spectrum at large k : μ = \u0018 ν 3 ε \u0019 1 / 4 where ε is the energy dissipation rate. The wavelength at which the spectrum breaks, called the inner scale, is estimated to be about an order of magnitude larger than μ . The dependence on ε is very weak, so increasing the energy cas- cade only changes μ by a small amount. The kinematic viscosity coefficient does change dramatically in the atmosphere and dominates the variation of μ with height. Hocking (1983) calculated these other parameters as a function of alti- tude, as shown in Fig. 3.36. The inner scale increases from a few centimeters near the ground to nearly 100 m at 100 km altitude. This latter result is very important because at this height the buoyancy scale and the microscale are nearly equal. Without an inertial subrange turbulence cannot exist and the atmosphere is no longer mixed. This height is called the tur- bopause; above it the molecules separate by diffusion according to their mass. In the transition region, turbulence is very patchy, and for any given profile, a patch of turbulent atmosphere can actually be above a region of nonturbulent fluid. An observation illustrating this phenomenon comes from pictures of chemilumi- nescent meteor trails and is shown in Fig. 5.25b. The well-defined double trail portion of the trail is below the very puffy, turbulent piece. The puffy portion was found to expand at a rate consistent with turbulent diffusion, whereas the lower turbulent portion exhibited molecular diffusion (Kelley et al., 2003b)."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Equatorial Zone 125 90 80 70 60 altitude (km) 50 40 30 20 10 0 10 2 4 10 2 3 10 2 2 10 2 1 110 10 2 10 3 10 4 Scale (m) Inertial Buoyancy Viscous Figure 3.36 Various subranges in the earth’s atmosphere. (Figure courtesy of W. Hocking.) Since atmospheric radars can detect scatter from clear air turbulence, Fig. 3.36 shows why a given radar can only see up to a certain height. If the radar Bragg scale is too deeply into the viscous subrange, no echo can be detected. In the meso- sphere it is necessary for electrons to be mixed by the turbulence to get a signal because the air is so tenuous. Thus, large long-wavelength (e.g., 50 MHz) radar systems can obtain mesospheric echoes in daytime and M-S-T (Mesosphere- Stratosphere-Troposphere) radars can be built to study virtually the entire atmo- sphere up to 100 km. In summary: 1. Below 110 km or so, on average, the atmosphere is mixed by turbulence, which feeds off buoyancy or shear forces. Such structures are roughly isotropic. 2. Above this height the atmospheric constituents begin to separate according to multi- component molecular diffusion (Vlasov and Davydov, 1982). 3. Above the turbopause the neutral atmosphere no longer has a turbulent structure, and any radar scatter must be due to plasma instabilities or incoherent scatter. The former is highly anisotropic.

Most of the information we have concerning these processes comes from radio wave scattering or reflection experiments con- ducted from the surface of the earth. In situ measurements made with rocket- and satellite-borne sensors have also contributed significantly to our present under- standing. As in the previous chapter, instabilities occurring in the F region are addressed first, followed by consideration of lower-altitude phenomena. We also discuss mesospheric turbulence because plasma turbulence is often described in an analogous manner. 4.1 F-Region Plasma Instabilities: Observations Plasma instability phenomena occurring in the equatorial F-region ionosphere are usually grouped under the generic name equatorial spread F (ESF). This stems from the earliest observations using ionosondes, which showed that on occasion the reflected echo did not display a well-behaved pattern but was “spread” in range or frequency (Berkner and Wells, 1934). A physics-based name for this phe- nomenon is “convective equatorial ionospheric storm” (CEIS). The phenomenon occurs primarily at night, although isolated daytime events occur (Woodman et al., 1985; Chau and Woodman, 2001). The modern era in CEIS (ESF) studies began on a “low” theoretical note in 1970 with the publication of the first com- pilation of measurements made by the Jicamarca Radar Observatory in Peru (Farley et al., 1970). The authors concluded that no theory published to date could explain the data! Fortunately, considerable progress has occurred since then, and the theory has kept pace with continuing additions and improvements in the data. In the early 1970s, range-time-intensity (RTI) “weather” radar maps came into vogue as a method of following the position and intensity of CEIS plasma density irregularities. Since the Jicamarca radar is stationary and has a small field of view ( ∼ 1 ◦ ), the RTI maps are similar to pictures from a slit camera.

The Jicamarca radar transmits nearly vertically, and at its 50 MHz fre- quency it is sensitive to backscatter from waves that satisfy the Bragg matching condition. This condition requires that k r = k s + k m , where k r is the radar wave vector, k s the scattered wave vector, and k m the wave vector in the medium. (See Appendix A for more details.) Since k s =− k r for backscatter, it follows that k m = 2 k r . Thus, the Jicamarca 50 MHz radar ( λ = 6 m) detects only waves with vertical wave vectors corresponding to a 3 m wavelength. In the F region of the ionosphere (above 200 km), both figures display intense echoes over a 100 km altitude extent for much of the time. The gray scale shows the echo strength to be up to 50 dB higher than that caused by thermal fluctuations at the 3 m wavelength. This “thermal backscatter level” is the source of the incoherent scatter echoes often used to determine ionospheric parameters (see Appendix A). The thick irregularity layer moves up or down with time rather periodically in Fig. 4.1 and twice is interrupted by a period of intense backscatter signal that extends to very high altitudes. In Fig. 4.2 this happens only once at about 2110 local time. These towering echoing features have been termed “plumes.” As we shall see, this name is quite apt for structures that are probably the result of a convective instability driven by buoyancy forces, much like tropospheric thun- derstorms. The horizontal time scale is such that the mean horizontal plasma drift speed (125 m / s toward the east) multiplied by time yields the same hori- zontal distance scale as given in the vertical altitude scale. Thus, the picture yields an accurate description of the ionospheric scatterers (as viewed looking south"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 133 800 600 400 Altitude (km) 200 19 19.5 20 20.5 21 21.5 Hours LT 1996/09/06 22 22.5 23 23.5 0 50 2 50 2 100 2 150 2 100 2 200 V z (m/s) 100 150 800 600 400 Altitude (km) 200 19 19.5 20 20.5 21 21.5 Hours LT 1996/09/06 22 22.5 23 23.5 V x (m/s) 0 100 200 800 600 400 Altitude (km) 200 19 19.5 20 20.5 21 21.5 Hours LT 1996/09/06 JULIA radar at Jicamarca 22 22.5 23 23.5 30 20 10 0 S/N dB Figure 4.2 An RTI map for September 6, 1996, is reproduced in the top panel.

Since the probing radar wavelength is very small compared to the scales involved in the phenomena, they can be consid- ered as tracers, but care must be taken in the interpretation of the observed fea- tures in these maps. Nonetheless, the inspired interpretation made by Woodman and LaHoz (1976) that the plumes represent upwelling of plasma “bubbles” has stood the test of time and is consistent with in situ data from rockets and satellites."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"134 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics The radar signal is Doppler-shifted due to any irregularity drift in the line-of- sight direction. The central panel in Fig. 4.2 is coded to show this with green to red, denoting ascent. Indeed, the central plume region is moving rapidly upward. An interferometric data analysis method has been developed at Jicamarca to reveal east-west motion. The lower panel in Fig. 4.2 is coded in such a way that eastward and westward velocities can be distinguished. As discussed in Chapter 3, by sunset the zonal F-region drift has long since reversed from west- ward to eastward, easily explaining the westward irregularity motions. But the initial thin echoing region is traveling westward, creating a shear in the plasma flow (Hysell and Burcham, 1998; see Chapter 3). These westward drifting irregularities are termed “bottom-type” irregularities. The thickening of the layer after 2040 (discounting plumes) occurs in the region of F-region dynamo control, since the drift is eastward. Such extended regions are called bottom- side irregularities. Plumes usually form just once on a given night, if at all, and are sometimes called “apogee” plumes when they rise out of a bottom- side layer that has reached its apex height (e.g., at 1935 LT and 2125 LT in Fig. 4.1; 2110 LT in Fig. 4.2). Detecting two apogee plumes (as in Fig. 4.1) at a limited field-of-view ground site is very unusual and is discussed again in Sec- tion 4.2.3. However, satellite and all-sky imagers often see multiple plumes, prob- ably because the terminator, which sets up the unstable condition, moves rapidly westward, whereas the plumes move eastward. Thus, a narrow field-of-view ground site may only see one plume on a typical night but, on occasion, can detect several. Several rockets and satellites have now penetrated both the irregularity lay- ers and the plume structures. For such studies, it has proven useful to cor- relate the in situ probing with Jicamarca or with the Altair scanning radar located on the Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. An example of a radar (RTI) map made at 0 . 96 m wavelength with the Altair radar on Kwajalein is presented in Fig. 4.3a, along with the plasma density profile made simultane- ously onboard the PLUMEX I rocket (Rino et al., 1981). The profile is highly irregular throughout the rocket trajectory, but the most crucial observation is that the intensely scattering top, or “head,” of the radar plume is collocated with a region of depleted plasma, a bubble. Another example that correlates AE-E satellite plasma density measurements with Altair data is presented in Fig. 4.3b. The plot shows that the radar plume is associated with a very struc- tured region of plasma in which the mean density is much less than the value outside the volume of backscatter (Tsunoda et al., 1982). An Altair radar scan in the north-south plane is represented in Fig. 4.4 and shows that the depleted regions are elongated along the direction of the magnetic field for hundreds of kilometers.

We can say that they are typically of the form k − n with 2 ≤ n ≤ 3 and that they break to a much steeper form somewhere in the range of 60 m. In Fig. 4.5b we contrast horizontal spectra from AE-E, which has access to longer wavelengths with the four rocket spectra obtained in the Kwajalein rocket campaign and the distribution of scales detected by an HF channel probe (see Fig. 4.12). The satellite data do not extend to small enough scales to detect the steep portion of the spectrum, which is more clearly evident here than in Fig. 4.5a.

The satellite horizontal spectra show a peak at 200 km and a secondary (local) maximum near 50 km. Both of these features are detected in the HF data (see Fig. 4.12 and related discussion of the HF technique). A new dimension to our understanding of CEIS came with the advent of elec- tric field measurements in Project Condor. The first spectral data of this sort are shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 4.5c. It is important to note that the electric field spectrum is almost featureless, while the density spectrum changes form at 40 Hz, which corresponds to a wavelength of about 50 m. Even better data were obtained in the Kwajalein campaign, which we explore further in Section 4.4. It is clear, however, that the physics changes in the 50–100 m scale size regime. 13 August 1978 Time — UT 1041 1042 1043 6 5 4 Log 10 N i (cm 2 3 ) 300 AE-E Magnetic east distance from Altair (km) 1039:45 UT 1033:49 UT 1026:02 UT Altitude (km) 50 dB 40 dB 30 dB 20 dB 10 dB 0 dB A B C D 700 600 500 300 200 100 400 2 300 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 Figure 4.3b Simultaneous horizontal satellite plasma density profile and backscatter map made with the Altair radar.

Airglow observations have also proven to be quite valuable. Figure 4.7a shows an image taken in the 630 nm emission due to excited atomic oxygen in the thermosphere. This is emitted in the two-step recombination of O + discussed in Chapter 1, which also yields a 557 . 7 nm emission (e.g., Fig. 4.7b). The dark bands indicate regions that are either low in plasma density or high in altitude; very likely both attributes contribute based on all of the other data shown in this section. Figure 4.7b shows that plumes can extend to well over 1500 km. Here, two CCD camera outputs are combined to show both the base of the equatorial ionosphere and the plumes as they map to the ionosphere north of Hawaii. Many bifurcations occur, and the plumes widen as they reach high equatorial altitudes. Structure can be seen at the base of the ionosphere (see arrows). It is important to note that the airglow over Hawaii, for example, is generated locally.

But before we can explore these processes, we need to understand plasma instability theory as it applies to these equatorial ionospheric storms. 4.2 Development and Initiation of Convective Equatorial Ionospheric Storms (a.k.a. Equatorial Spread F) 4.2.1 Linear Theory of the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability Dungey (1956) first proposed the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability as the process driving CEIS. This mechanism was temporarily rejected along with all the other candidate theories by Farley et al. (1970), since, as we shall see, it seemed capable only of generating structure on the bottomside of the F-region plasma density profile. The manner in which the RT instability can cause irregularities to grow in the equatorial ionosphere is illustrated in Fig. 4.9a, using a two-dimensional model. Here the steep upward-directed gradient, which develops on the bottom- side of the nighttime F layer (see Chapter 3), is approximated by a step function."},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 143 g B J 5 nMg 3 B B 2 B E 0 a nd J 5 \u0003 p E 0 n 1 = n 0 n 2 5 0 \u0002 E \u0002 E 3 B \u0002 E 3 B \u0002 E 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 Figure 4.9a Schematic diagram of the plasma analog of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in the equatorial geometry. The density is equal to n 1 above the interface and zero below. The gravitational force is downward, antiparallel to the density gradient, and the magnetic field is horizontal, into the paper. An initial small sinusoidal perturbation is also illus- trated, and we assume that the plasma is nearly collisionless—that is, that κ i and κ e are large. From (2.36c) we can determine the electrical current by considering the ion and electron velocities due to the pressure gradients and gravity. First, we note that the pressure-driven current does not create any perturbation electric fields, since the current is everywhere perpendicular to the density gradient. The pressure-driven current thus flows parallel to the modulated density pattern and has no divergence. Turning to the gravitational term in (2.36c), the species velocity is proportional to its mass, so the ion term dominates. A net current flows in the x direction with magnitude J x = nMg / B Since the current is in the g × B direction, which is strictly horizontal, J x will be large when n is large and small when n is small. There is thus a divergence, and charge will pile up on the edges of the small initial perturbation. As a result, perturbation electric fields ( δ E ) build up in the directions shown. These fields in turn cause an upward δ E × B drift of the plasma in the region of plasma depletion and a downward drift in the region where the density is high. Lower (higher) density plasma is therefore advected upward (downward), creating a larger perturbation, and the system is unstable. An analogous hydrodynamic phenomenon is illustrated in the series of sketches in Fig. 4.9b.

In the ionospheric case the “light fluid” is the low-density plasma, which carries a gravity-driven current that provides the J × B force, preventing the plasma from freely falling. The system is unstable when g and ∇ n are oppositely directed. We discuss the E 0 term shown at the top right of Fig. 4.9a following. We now calculate more formally the growth rate of the RT instability, assum- ing a small initial perturbation in plasma density and electric field. Inertial terms are dropped, which corresponds to the condition ν in \u0006 ∂/∂ t . This approximation breaks down at high altitudes but is certainly valid on the bottomside and up to 450 km or so. Using (2.37b) and ignoring neutral winds for now, the steady velocity of each species under the influence of electric and gravitational fields is given by V j ⊥ = [ 1 /( 1 + κ 2 j )] W j ⊥ + [ κ j /( 1 + κ 2 j )] [ W j ⊥ × ˆ B ] (4.1) where W j = b j E + g /ν j n − D j ∇ n / n (4.2)"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 145 For the electrons κ e is so large that the second term dominates in (4.1) and V e = E × B / B 2 − ( m / eB 2 ) ( g × B ) + ( k B T e / eB 2 n ) ( ∇ n × B ) (4.3) For the ions κ i \u0006 1 in the F region, but it is not so great that the first term in (4.1) can be ignored, as was the case for the electrons. For the F region that term can be written as W i ⊥ /κ 2 i , and we have V i ⊥ = ( b i /κ 2 i ) E + g /( ν in κ 2 i ) − ( D i /κ 2 i ) ( ∇ n / n ) + E × B / B 2 + ( M / eB 2 ) ( g × B ) − ( k B T i / eB 2 n ) ( ∇ n × B ) (4.4) The electron mass is so small that the g × B term in (4.3) can be dropped. The second and third terms in the right-hand side of (4.4) are small due to the fact that κ i \u0006 1, and we take n i = n e = n . Now, since the E × B term is identical for ions and electrons, no current flows due to those terms. J is given by J = ne ( V i − V e ) = σ P E + ( ne /\b i ) g × ˆ B − ( k B / B 2 ) ( T i + T e ) ( ∇ n × B ) (4.5) Here we have used the fact that for large κ i , σ P = neb i /κ 2 i . The gravity term also is rewritten in terms of \b i . Notice that the gravitational current flows even in a collisionless plasma, while the electric field term exists only if σ P \b= 0—that is, in a collisional plasma. We now study the linear stability of a vertically stratified equatorial F layer under only the influence of gravity—that is, the pure Rayleigh-Taylor case. We set E 0 = 0 for now but retain a first-order electric field perturbation δ E . The continuity and current divergence equations from Chapter 2 will be used in the analysis. Ignoring production and loss, which is reasonable in the postsunset time period when the F layer is very high, the continuity equation is ∂ n /∂ t + V ·∇ n + n ( ∇· V ) = 0 (4.6) where for M \u0006 m the plasma velocity V may be approximated by V i .

However, care must be taken in applying this result since it is not a fundamental principle and must be checked in each case. It is certainly not true in the E region, where compressibility plays an important role in the formation of images of F-region phenomena (see Chapter 10). Setting ( ∇· V ) = 0, the equations we shall linearize are ∂ n /∂ t + V ·∇ n = 0 (4.8a) ∇· J = 0 (4.8b) To study the electrostatic instability of these equations in the presence of a vertical zero-order density gradient, we can write the electric potential and the plasma density as φ = δφ e i (ω t − kx ) (4.9a) n = n 0 ( z ) + δ ne i (ω t − kx ) (4.9b) where the initial perturbation propagates in the x direction. Note that we have already assumed charge neutrality so that n e = n i = n . Using (4.5) with E replaced by δ E , (4.8b) becomes ∇· [ ( ne /\b i ) g × ˆ B + ( ne 2 ν in / M \b 2 i ) δ E ] = 0 (4.10) where again we have used the fact that ∇· ( ∇ n × B ) = 0 to set the divergence of the pressure-driven current equal to zero. Here δ E is the perturbation electric field associated with the potential φ , and we have substituted (2.40b) for σ P in the F region. Since δ E =−∇ φ , the vector inside the square bracket in the preceding equation only has an x component and taking the x derivative yields ( eg /\b i ) (∂ n /∂ x ) − ( e 2 ν in / M \b 2 i ) (∂ n /∂ x )(∂φ/∂ x ) − ( ne 2 ν in / M \b 2 i )( ∂ 2 φ/∂ x 2 ) = 0 The second term is of second order, and thus the linear form of this equation is ( eg /\b i ) (∂ n /∂ x ) − ( ne 2 ν in / M \b 2 i )( ∂ 2 φ/∂ x 2 ) = 0 (4.11a) Making the substitutions P = M ν in / B 2 , Q = Mg / B (4.11a) becomes Q ( ∂ n /∂ x ) − Pn ( ∂ 2 φ/∂ x 2 ) = 0 (4.11b)"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 147 Turning now to the continuity equation (4.8a), we have (∂ n /∂ t ) + V x (∂ n /∂ x ) + V z (∂ n /∂ z ) = 0 The two velocity components may be obtained from (4.4) if we remember that the electric field δ E is of first order, κ i is large, and the pressure-driven velocity does not contribute to V ·∇ n . Since ∂ n /∂ x is of first order, only the zero-order V x contributes to the second term—hence, V x = Mg / eB = Q / e . In the third term, ∂ n /∂ z is of zero order due to the vertical density gradient in the plasma. We must then include the first-order vertical velocity given by V z = δ E x / B . The linearized continuity equation is therefore ∂ n /∂ t + ( Q / e )(∂ n /∂ x ) − ( 1 / B )(∂φ/∂ x )(∂ n /∂ z ) = 0 (4.12) Using the plane wave solutions, (4.11b) and (4.12) may be written − ikQ δ n + n 0 k 2 P δφ = 0 (4.13a) ( i ω − ikQ / e )δ n + ( ik / B ) ( ∂ n 0 /∂ z ) δφ = 0 (4.13b) These are two equations in two unknowns, δ n and δφ , and may be solved by setting the determinant of coefficients equal to zero. This yields the dispersion relation ω = ( kQ / e ) − i ( g /ν in ) ( 1 / n 0 )( ∂ n 0 /∂ z ) (4.14) The real part of ω, ω r , shows that the plane waves propagate eastward with phase velocity V φ given by V φ = ω r / k = Q / e = Mg / eB (4.15a) For an atomic oxygen plasma at the equator V φ ≈ 6cm / s, which is quite small. The imaginary part of ω is ω i =− ( g /ν in ) [ ( 1 / n 0 )( ∂ n 0 /∂ z ) ] (4.15b) When ∂ n 0 /∂ z is positive (corresponding here to the density gradient antipar- allel to g ), ω i is negative and e i ω t = e i ω r t e γ t where γ is positive and thus yields a growing solution.

First, in the initial development of spread F, there is a strong tendency for a VHF radar to obtain echoes confined to the height range where the density gradient is upward. In fact, the early Jicamarca study showed that the onset of nonthermal backscatter usually began at a density level about 1% of the plasma density at the F peak. Several rockets have been flown during bottomside ESF at times when no radar echoes were obtained above the F peak, and, indeed, intense irregularities were found below the peak but a smooth pro- file was found above. These cases are thus in agreement with the linear theory in that the latter predicts instability only when g is antiparallel to ∇ n . Another feature predicted by the theory is a height dependency for γ due to the colli- sion frequency term in the growth rate denominator: the higher the layer, the lower ν in and the larger the instability growth rate. As mentioned earlier, Farley et al. (1970) noted a strong tendency for irregularities to be generated when the layer was at a high altitude where the collision term is small. Notice that the plume structure in Fig. 4.2, the initial plume in Fig. 4.1, and the multiple plumes in Fig. 4.8 were all generated when the echoing layer was at its peak altitude. This also suggests that the most spectacular effects occur when the ionosphere is high. Indeed, strong evidence for the control of CEIS by the height of the F layer was presented by Fejer et al. (1999). An example from their study is summarized in Fig. 4.10, based on Jicamarca radar data. In this plot the vertical lines indicate the presence of 3 m irregularities, which define active conditions. We qualify this since, as shown in Fig. 4.6, longer wavelength structures can exist long after the 3 m irregularities are gone. The circles indicate the vertical drift velocity and the x’s indicate the altitude of maximum incoherent scatter backscatter power, which occurs just below the F peak. Magnetic activity (average K p ) for these September 1987 examples were, sequentially, 2.9, 2.9, and 4.5, and the solar decimetric flux, a measure of solar activity, was near 80 units (solar minimum conditions). Inspection shows that CEIS begins if and only if the peak reached 400 km at onset. The extended altitude on September 23 occurred on the night that the highest altitude was reached. Note that high K p suppressed the zonal electric field and CEIS on September 25. This could be due to either a disturbance dynamo or the penetration electric fields discussed in Chapter 3. The fundamental destabilizing source is the current density arising due to the differential drift of ions and electrons, which is dependent on mass. However, the growth rate of CEIS (4.16) is independent of mass. This is essentially due to the assumption of a single ion composition in the F region. Molecular ions are also found to exist in the F region, along with atomic oxygen, during evening (Sridharan et al., 1997) and nighttime (Narcisi and Szuszczewicz, 1981) in the equatorial ionosphere. The growth rate expression derived by including the ionic constituents (Sekar and Kherani, 1999) reveals that the growth rate of CEIS depends on the mass and number densities of both ions."},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 149 Jic a m a rc a 2 3 S eptem b er 19 8 7 8 0 S pF H MP 40 0 2 40 8 00 600 400 200 24 S eptem b er 19 8 7 8 0 40 0 2 40 8 00 600 400 200 25 S eptem b er 19 8 7 8 0 40 0 16 1 8 20 Loc a l time 22 24 2 40 8 00 600 400 200 Vertic a l drift (m/ s ) Height (km) Figure 4.10 Vertical drift velocities (circles), heights of maximum backscattered power ( x ) , and spread F scattering layers (vertical lines) during March 1985.

If we return to (4.5), we can include the effect of the ambient electric field E 0 as well as the neutral wind. The latter can easily be included by remembering (see Chapter 3) that when electric fields and winds both exist, the current density is σ · E 0 where E 0 = E 0 + U × B . Since the fundamental destabilizing source is the current, σ P E is the correct quantity to investigate. First we note that for a zonally eastward electric field, the zero-order Pedersen current is in the same direction ( g × B ) as the gravity-driven current. The derivation outlined previ- ously, which considered only gravity, can be generalized to include the effect"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"150 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics of an electric field by replacing g /ν in with g /ν in + E x 0 / B in the growth rate, where E x 0 is the zonal component of the electric field in the neutral frame of reference. A zonally eastward electric field drives a Pedersen current to the east. Any undulation of the boundary will intercept charge just as in the gravitational case and cause the perturbation to grow. Hence, an eastward E x 0 (eastward E x and/or downward wind) is destabilizing. A zonally westward field will be stabilizing on the bottomside. The general condition for instability is that the E x 0 × B direction be parallel to the plasma density gradient. As discussed in the previous chapter, the zonal electric field component at the equator often increases to a large eastward value just after sunset, driving the F layer to very high altitudes. This uplift contributes in two ways to the destabilization of the plasma. Not only is the electric field in the right direction for instability but also the gravitational term becomes large due to the high altitude of the layer. The growth rates of the gravitational and electric field–driven processes are plotted as a function of height in Fig. 4.11. For a 0 . 5mV / m eastward elec- tric field, the two sources of instability are equal at an altitude of 375 km. The gravitational term dominates above this height and increases exponentially with altitude. Since a large-scale neutral wind is usually horizontal, ( U × B ) × B is also hor- izontal and thus usually has no component parallel to ∇ n if the ionosphere is vertically stratified. Hence, ( E x 0 × B ) ·∇ n above is due entirely to the zonal electric field. However, other terms can be added to the linear growth rate by considering the possibility of a horizontal component of ∇ n and/or a vertical wind.

In such a case, the linear growth rate may be written in the following form: γ RT = E x − wB LB cos \f + g ν in L cos \f + E z + uB LB sin \f (4.17) where L is the gradient scale length on the bottomside, \f is the tilt angle, the z -axis is upward, the x -axis is eastward, and we ignore any dip angle of the magnetic field. The tilt angle is defined such that if it represented an inclined plane a ball would roll down and west for positive \f and down and east for negative \f . This is the growth rate of the generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability as it is applied to the equatorial ionosphere. Kelley et al. (1981), for example, used it to interpret Fig. 4.1 and concluded that the preference for plumes to be generated during negative slopes of the Jicamarca radar profile was due to the contribution of an eastward neutral wind ( u ˆ a x ) to the instability growth rate. That is, if the ionosphere is tilted such that the neutral wind blows toward the east into a region of increasing plasma density so that (( u ˆ a x × B ) × B ) is antiparallel to the density gradient, a stable configuration occurs. However, if the wind blows antiparallel to the plasma gradient, which is believed to occur during the downward slopes in Fig. 4.1, the wind is destabilizing. Tsunoda (1981, 1983; see also Fig. 4.14), using the scanning radar at Kwajalein, has also shown that wind effects are important. Note, however, that if a perfect polarization field develops due to the F-region dynamo, E z + uB = 0, and there would be no effect of the third term in (4.17). This is a reminder that these instabilities are current driven, not electric field driven. However, due to a finite E-region loading of the current, u usually exceeds E z / B by 20% or so, and a vertical current does flow. Since the electric field is generated by both local and remote wind fields (see the previous chapter) the generalized growth rate represents quite a complicated set of phenomena (we have not yet mentioned the role of shear in the plasma flow). Vertical neutral winds do occur when gravity waves propagate upward through the thermosphere-ionosphere system. In addition, there is some evi- dence that larger-scale, downward winds may occur near the sunset terminator. Raghavarao et al. (1987), for example, have reported just such conditions from rocket-borne chemical release experiments. Of course, it could have been the case that even these winds were due to a long-period gravity wave. For refer- ence, a vertical density gradient pointed upward is unstable to a downward wind velocity (Sekar and Raghavarao, 1987). Hysell et al. (1990) conjectured that the stripes in Fig. 4.8 were due to the vertical velocity phase of a gravity wave. Linear instability theory may also be used to explain the day-night asymme- try of CEIS, since the instability is influenced by the effects of the E region on the charge buildup that leads to the instability. The equatorial ionosphere is not"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"152 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics two-dimensional, since electric currents can easily flow down the magnetic field lines if there is a conducting path through the E region. The physics is identical to that discussed in Chapter 3, which showed that the F-region dynamo was sup- pressed during the day, when the low-altitude conductivity dominates. During the daytime, any perturbation electric fields due to the instability are shorted out in the E region, which explains why spread F does not begin until well after sun- set, even though g and ∇ n are antiparallel on the bottomside during the day as well as at night. A full explanation of the morphology of CEIS thus must include the diurnal, seasonal, and solar cycle effects on the electric field, on the neutral density, temperature, and wind patterns, and on conductivities of the E and F regions. Developments in the ability to create realistic models of the equatorial ionosphere are occurring rapidly and many of the effects mentioned above now can be included (de La Beaujardiére et al., 2006). Longitudinal differences occur due to the offset of the magnetic and geographic equators, the possible influences of orographic features, and the varying declina- tion of the magnetic field. Fejer et al. (1999) suggest that all of these factors influ- ence the prereversal enhancement electric field. This quantity, in turn, controls the height and tilt of the ionosphere and, thus, CEIS. We showed in Chapter 3 that the zonal electric field measured over Peru as a function of local time cannot be extrapolated to represent the zonal electric field as a function of longitude for a fixed local time. Thus, to ever predict CEIS, we need data-assimilative models that include information on the worldwide zonal electric field, the thermospheric wind patterns, and the conductivity of the E region. The zonal electric field and neutral winds also influence the equatorial ioni- zation anomaly (discussed in Chapter 5), which develops well before the sunset and thus possibly can be used to predict the onset of CEIS. Based on ionospheric sounding studies over the Indian zone, an empirical correlation between the occurrence of CEIS and the strength (ratio) between the electron densities at the crest and trough region of the equatorial ionization anomaly was found by Raghavarao et al. (1988). This same concept was followed by Sridharan et al. (1994) using a daytime optical technique to get a real time prediction. Along similar lines, Alex et al. (1989) reported a correlation between the occurrence of CEIS and the latitudinal gradient in electron densities at a fixed altitude over American longitudes during postsunset hours. Recent multi-instrumented studies (Mendillo et al., 2001) also suggested that a good precursor for premidnight CEIS is the late-afternoon strength of the equatorial ionization anomaly. Further investigations over various regions and seasons are required to consolidate this notion. 4.2.3 The Seeding of Convective Ionospheric Storms by Gravity Waves In addition to the factors just mentioned, there is very likely an additional random factor in the occurrence of CEIS that may hinder attempts to develop predictive"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 153 LINDAU – TSUMEB March 1, 1971 18.21 MHz 14 8 28 8 35 8 40 8 46 8 56 8 45 8 40 8 2 20 8 2 30 8 2 30 8 2 32 8 2 34 8 2 39 8 2 33 8 2 27 8 2 26 8 33 8 Great circle propagation Great circle deviation \u0005 5 24 8 Scattered path Discrete path Scatter background C C 38.0 36.0 34.0 36.0 34.0 32.0 32.0 30.0 30.0 27.8 ms West t 9 t 9 ms East t UT 1700 1800 1900 2000 2100 2200 Figure 4.12 Forward scatter measurements in the African sector showing regular wave- like regions of enhanced plasma density.

The generalized RT instability can take over and cause the oscillation to grow. In fact, the generalized R-T growth rate is so small that seeding may be essential, either by gravity waves or by the collisional Kelvin-Helmholtz process discussed following. Such seeding can greatly decrease the time needed to develop a large-amplitude disturbance. Strong evidence for the organization of bottomside plasma into structures with scales of several hun- dred kilometers is given in Fig. 4.12 (see also Figs. 4.1 and 4.5b). The data are from a transequatorial HF radio propagation experiment. If the ionosphere were uniform, refraction would yield a single “great circle” path with some minimum time delay. However, when the plasma density has an east-west structure, addi- tional, larger time delays occur, which can be used to characterize the structure. The data show that paths other than the great circle route occur in regular inter- vals, which are found to be typical of internal gravity wave wavelengths. One explanation for this effect, proposed by Beer (1973), was that the temperature variation in the gravity wave would change the recombination rate of the iono- spheric plasma and thereby create a density modulation. The effect would be"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"154 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics particularly strong if the plasma drift speed matched the phase velocity of the wave, since in such a case the perturbation would always act in the same sense on a given parcel of plasma. This is a variation on the so-called spatial resonance theory suggested first by Whitehead (1971). Wave-like modulations of ordinary tropospheric clouds are created by this effect as the local temperature is raised above or lowered below the dew point by a gravity wave. Beer’s idea has not passed the test of time, but other gravity wave effects have been proposed, as discussed next. Klostermeyer (1978) also appealed to the spatial resonance effect but pointed out that the internal wind field, δ U in a gravity wave must also drive electrical cur- rents, δ J . Due to the finite wavelength of the gravity waves, the associated winds are not uniform in space. The divergence of the wind-driven electrical current is therefore not zero, and an electric field, δ E , must build up with a wavelength equal to that of the gravity wave. This process is illustrated in Fig. 4.13. If the E region is a perfect insulator, no field-aligned currents can flow and the ∇· J = 0 equation may be replaced by the more restrictive equation δ J = 0, where δ J has components due to the gravity wave wind and the electric field. This require- ment has been used to generate the diagram. The resulting electric field pattern has alternating eastward and westward components, which, due to the δ E × B drift, will cause portions of the ionosphere to rise and portions to fall. Now, if the plasma has a zero-order vertical density gradient, the V ·∇ n term in the continuity equation will lead to a sinusoidal density pattern with the same hori- zontal wavelength as the gravity wave. These east-west oscillations may then act as an initial perturbation, which is amplified by the Rayleigh-Taylor process (see Fig. 4.1). An additional attractive feature of the gravity wave theory is that after sunset the ionosphere begins to descend. This is also the direction of the phase velocity of a gravity wave carrying energy upward from below (an upward grav- ity wave energy flux has a downward phase velocity, as discussed in Chapter 6). 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 J J u k \u0002 E 3 B \u0002 E 3 B \u0002 E \u0002 E B a z a x ˆ ˆ Figure 4.13a Schematic diagram showing how the perturbation winds in a gravity wave generate electric fields."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 155 Spatial resonance could thus occur with a zonally eastward-propagating wave, since it is well known that the plasma also drifts in the eastward direction (see Chapter 3). Furthermore, the magnitudes of the typical eastward and downward plasma drifts are roughly comparable to the typical phase velocities of large-scale gravity waves in the upper atmosphere. Gravity wave–induced electric fields have now been observed (Kudeki et al., 1999; Varney et al., 2009). Figure 4.13b shows the classic downward-phase progression of the vertical velocity over Arecibo. If we assume a nonconducting E region and a gravity wave at F-region heights, then, as previously argued, the divergence of the wind-driven current will set up polarization charges and an electric field such that δ J = σ P (δ E + δ U × B ) = 0 and thus, δ E =− (δ U × B ) where σ P is the Pedersen conductivity, δ E is the perturbation electric field in the earth-fixed frame, δ U is the perturbation wind velocity due to the gravity wave, and B is the magnetic field. The net effect of the dynamo is to cause the plasma and the neutral gas to move together in the gravity wave wind field, since δ V = δ E × B / B 2 = δ U . To determine quantitatively the effect of such a perturbation, we first consider the case of perfect spatial resonance in which the mean unperturbed plasma is at rest in a fixed phase front pattern associated with the gravity wave; that is, the plasma drift matches the wave phase velocity 1 9 20 21 22 23 0 1 2 20 2 10 0 10 20 0 9 /2 9 / 9 4 LT ( hours ) Velocity (m/s) Figure 4.13b Stack plot of the vertical drift velocities at individual heights.

Since the plasma behaves as an incompressible fluid, the density variation with time at a fixed point in space is given by the advective derivative ∂ n /∂ t =− δ V ·∇ n (4.18) where n is the plasma density and δ V the perturbation plasma velocity. Here we again use a right-hand coordinate system with x positive in the eastward direction and y positive toward the north. For perfect spatial resonance the perturbation neutral velocity in the plasma reference frame is time independent (the wave frequency is Doppler shifted to zero) and (4.18) becomes ∂ n /∂ t =− w 0 e − ik x x + ik z z (∂ n /∂ z ) (4.19) For an initial density profile of the form n 0 e z / L the solution to (4.19) is n ( x , z , t ) = n 0 e z / L e γ( x , z ) t (4.20a) where γ( x , z ) = R { − ( w 0 / L ) e − ik x x + ik z z } (4.20b) where R means “take the real part.” These equations describe a spatial pat- tern of rising and falling density contours in the plasma reference frame. For w 0 = 2m / s and L = 20 km, the peak value of γ is 10 − 4 s − 1 . This “perfect” spatial resonance theory gives a perturbation of 5% in 550 s. Note, however, that the perturbation plasma ion velocity due to the presence of the wave can never exceed the amplitude of the wave-induced neutral velocity. This con- straint severely limits the altitude modulation of the F layer due to a pure grav- ity wave-driven process. In Klostermeyer’s (1978) nonlinear approach to this problem, an anomalous diffusion due to plasma microinstabilities was mod- eled, and the saturation amplitude of the density perturbation for perfect spatial resonance was found to be at most about one order of magnitude (e.g., see his Fig. 4.1). This corresponds to an uplift of about 3 plasma scale heights or about 50 km. It is now clear that much larger perturbations occur (e.g., see Fig. 4.1) and a pure gravity wave theory explaining CEIS height modulation is not tenable. This simple model can be extended to address the question of how “resonant” a wave must be to create a significant effect. Kelley et al. (1981) showed that the horizontal phase velocity of the gravity wave only has to be within only about 100 m / s of the horizontal plasma drift velocity to produce a 5% seed- ing effect in one-half of a wave period. This is not a very severe constraint and makes it very plausible that gravity waves can be responsible for seed- ing spread F. Huang and Kelley (1996) performed nonlinear simulations (see Section 4.3.2) with and without spatial resonance and verified that it is not necessary."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 157 Returning again to Fig. 4.1, Kelley et al. (1981) concluded that a gravity wave could have seeded the event but that the large uplifts ( ∼ 80 m / s) observed must have resulted from an amplification of the induced perturbation by the Rayleigh- Taylor process. Sometimes plumes have velocities over 1000 m / s, which is com- pletely out of the question for a neutral air speed (it is supersonic!). They also argued that the multiple plumes located on the descending phase of the oscilla- tion were due to a neutral wind blowing eastward across a structure tilted such that it had a westward density gradient. Tsunoda (1983) has shown this effect convincingly, using the scanning Altair radar. In the data shown in Fig. 4.14, for example, several plumes grow from a structure tilted in just this fashion, while the east wall is stable. Prakash and Pandy (1980) have pointed out that the perturbation electric fields that develop in response to the wave-driven electric current will be shorted out if magnetic field lines can link the regions of positive and negative charge. For pure (magnetic) zonal propagation this will not occur, but if a finite meridional component of the gravity wave vector exists, the seeding process will be limited to a small angular propagation zone near east-west. Those gravity waves gener- ated as a result of auroral activity [large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs)] propagate from the poles to the equator, while medium-scale TIDs may propagate in any direction. Thus, gravity waves generated in the auroral zone may be less effective for seeding equatorial spread F than waves generated by tropospheric sources such as thunderstorms, frontal systems, and orographic forcing. Seed processes may thus add another longitudinal factor to CEIS occur- rence probability.

Extending earlier work dealing with the E × B instability (Perkins and Doles, 1975), Satyanarayana et al. (1984) showed that velocity shear acts to stabilize the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. This is illustrated in Fig. 4.15, where the normalized growth rate ˆ γ = γν in L N / g is plotted versus the normalized wave number ˆ k = 2 π L N /λ for various values of the shear parameter ˆ S = dV / dz ( g / L N ) 1 / 2 ≈ V 0 / L ( g / L ) 1 / 2 where L N is the vertical density scale length, V 0 is the maximum in the plasma flow velocity, and the scale length L characterizes both the velocity shear and the density gradient scale length. ˆ S = 0 corresponds to no shear, and the corres- ponding curve yields the dependence of the Rayleigh-Taylor growth rate on ˆ k . This result differs from the simple analysis given earlier, for which ˆ γ = 1 for all values of k (until diffusion sets in). This more accurate linear theory shows that ˆ γ equals unity only for ˆ k ≥ 10 or λ ≤ 2 π L / 10 \f 0 . 6 L . Since L = 15 km, the pure RT growth rate is small for λ ≥ 10 km, where, experimentally, much of the largest perturbation occurs. For ˆ S > 0 the growth rate decreases at all ˆ k , but a peak in ˆ γ begins to evolve for small values of ˆ k . This means that velocity shear is stabilizing but that it does push the most unstable waves to long wavelengths. It is interesting to note that for ˆ S > 2 the growth rate begins to rise again, 1.2 0. 8 0.4 0 0.1 11 0 S 5 0 S 5 0.25 S 5 1 k \u0004 S 5 4 S 5 2 ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ Figure 4.15 Normalized growth rate plotted versus normalized wave number for various shear strengths.

The parameter ˆ S may be written ( ˆ S ) − 2 = [ ( g / n ) dn / dz ( dV / dz ) 2 ] = ( R ip ) where we have defined a plasma Richardson number R ip , which is analogous to the atmospheric Richardson number. In the atmospheric case the numerator is given by the Brunt-Vaisala frequency ω 2 B = ( g /θ)( d θ/ dz ) where θ is the potential temperature, so R i = ω 2 B /( dV / dz ) 2 . It is well known in atmospheric science that a shear is unstable for a Richardson number less than 1/4. This corresponds to ˆ S > 2. However, very intense shears would be required to meet this criterion— for example, if L = 15 km and ˆ S = 2, V 0 = 2 ( gL ) 1 / 2 = 760 m / s, which is much larger than the typical plasma velocity. Another way to look at this is to calculate the required shear if ˆ S = 2. For L = 15 km the required shear is 50 m / s per km. This is considerably larger than the observed large-scale vertical shears reported in the literature, some of which are shown in Chapter 3. Kelley et al. (1986) turned this argument around and asked, “Given the observed shears, what would ˆ k be for maximum growth?” They found the expected values of ˆ k to be in the range 0.5–2, which corresponds to λ values ranging from 45 to 180 km. These wavelengths are shorter than the outer scale limit for the horizontal spread F structure reported by Röttger (1973) and indi- cated by the studies of Kelley et al. (1981, 1986) and Tsunoda (1983). However, these values of λ are in good agreement with multiple plume spacings reported in the same three papers (see also Figs. 4.1, 4.7b, and 4.12). It thus may well be the case (Kelley et al., 1986) that gravity waves determine the outer horizontal scale by preferentially seeding a region of k space and creating perturbations with relatively low growth rates. Velocity shear and neutral winds then com- bine to structure the westward-directed horizontal density gradients, creating the observed multiple plumes. Shear effects have been reconsidered in the nonlinear domain (Hysell and Kudeki, 2004), as discussed in Section 4.3.2, and this notion that shear-related seeding of long wavelength structures has resurfaced as a viable mechanism. 4.2.5 Summary of Linear Theory Results To summarize, it is clear from linear theory that the generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability plays a crucial role in the production of convective ionospheric storms and that each of the destabilizing terms can be important at times. In addition, the initial conditions that lead to an event on a given night depend in a complicated way on the state of the ionosphere, the neutral atmosphere, and the patterns of gravity waves in the upper atmosphere.

We turn now to nonlinear calculations. 4.3 Nonlinear Theories of Convective Ionospheric Storms 4.3.1 Two-Dimensional Computer Simulations Considerable effort has gone into the development of computer simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The set of equations, which are solved in the two dimensions perpendicular to B , is a subset of the full governing equations. They consist of two continuity equations for the electrons and ions, ( ∂ n j /∂ t ) +∇· ( n j V j ) = 0 (4.21a) the electron velocity equation with κ e \u0006 1, V e = E ×ˆ a y B (4.21b) the ion velocity equation for intermediate κ i , V i = ( 1 / B ) [ ( M / e ) g + E ]×ˆ a y + ( ν in M / eB 2 ) [ ( M / e ) g + E ] (4.21c) the charge continuity equation, ∇· J = 0 =∇· ( n i e V i − n e e V e ) (4.21d) which is a form of the quasi-neutrality condition and E =−∇ φ (4.21e) In obtaining these equations we have assumed there is no neutral wind, we have neglected the inertial terms and the pressure-driven terms in the equations for conservation of momentum, and we have assumed that the g × B electron velocity term is small due to the small electron-ion mass ratio. The electrostatic potential φ is divided into a zero-order term, φ 0 , and a per- turbation term, δφ . If we require the zero-order ion velocity to be zero, then we must have ∇ φ 0 = M g / e . This zero-order electric field is the order of a micro- volt/meter and is somewhat artificial, but it creates an equilibrium about which to perturb the system. In reality, a larger zero-order electric field generally exists. The electron continuity equation evaluated in a frame of reference moving with the ( E 0 × B / B 2 ) velocity is ∂ n /∂ t − ( 1 / B ) ( ∇ δφ ×ˆ a y ) ·∇ n = 0 (4.22)"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 161 where we have dropped the subscript on the n due to the quasi-neutrality condition n e ≈ n i ≈ n .

Now, using E 0 =− M g / e , (4.21d) becomes ∇· ( n g × B − n ν in ∇ δφ ) = 0 (4.23) If we linearize the density terms in (4.22) and (4.23) and appropriately convert to the other coordinate system, we recover the dispersion relation (4.14) with Q = 0. Equations (4.22) and (4.23) are the two equations that have been solved numerically for n and δφ subject to a variety of geophysical conditions and initial perturbations (see review by Ossakow, 1981). In typical simulations, such as the ones illustrated in Figs. 4.16a–c, the initial vertical density profile is specified, as is an initial density perturbation. After a time, the order of 1000 s, the initial modulation grows to a sufficient enough amplitude that the low-density region (bubble) pushes through to the topside of the density profile, where the linear theory predicts a stable system (Ossakow, 1981). One of the crucial problems posed by Farley et al. (1970) is thus resolved. Although the system is linearly unstable only on the bottomside, the nonlinear evolution yields structure well above the F peak (Woodman and La Hoz, 1976). Computer simulations of plumes have been made to determine the ionospheric parameters to which plume development is most sensitive. Not too surprisingly, the higher the layer and the steeper the vertical density gradient, the faster the bubbles grow. This is also clear from the linear GRT growth rate. In addition, the simulations illustrated in Figs. 4.16a and b show that longer horizontal wavelengths result in larger density depletions and larger uplift velocities. For example, at a fixed height the topside density drops by only 10% for a 3 km horizontal wavelength, while it drops by two orders of magnitude for a 150 km initial perturbation. Comparison of the electric potential distribution around the upwelling plasma shows why this is the case. The charge buildup that leads to the upward flow creates fringing electric fields that penetrate deeply into the bottomside region. Low-density plasma thus convects upward to altitudes above the F peak. In fact, since the flow field is incompressible in the two-dimensional approximation used in the simulation, the density at a given point changes only when a low-density region is advected to that height by the δ E × B 0 drift. Each"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"162 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics density contour in the set of figures could thus be specified by its initial height as well as by the density. This idea explains the frequent observations of metallic and molecular ions at F-region altitudes in the equatorial zone. In other words, the chemical composition is also to some extent a label of the original altitude. Returning to Fig. 4.1, the downward penetration of electric fields predicted by the simulations can be seen from the upwelling of features as low as 120 km in conjunction with the large-amplitude topside modulations. Another simulation is shown in Fig. 4.16c. Here, a constant eastward neu- tral wind is included, as well as the effect of finite conducting “end plates” in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

The scanning radar data plotted in Fig. 4.14 have reversed C-shapes, since the scans are oriented with east to the right and west to the left—the opposite of 4.16c. The data and simulations are thus in excellent agreement. The eastward zonal plasma flow is due to the F-region dynamo, which must be powerful enough to drive the off-equatorial E-region loads. A likely explanation is that the depleted region polarizes and drifts more slowly eastward than the background plasma. For example, consider the region near the top of the plume. The vertical current is given by σ p ( uB + E z ) , which is upward because uB > | E z | for an F-region dynamo. Recall that E is negative— that is, the vertical electric field is downward. But inside the plume σ p is smaller than outside, and thus to maintain the current across the boundary, | E z | must"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"164 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics N 0 3 10 2 5 cm 2 3 N 0 3 10 2 5 cm 2 3 N 0 3 10 2 5 cm 2 3 1500 sec 2050 sec N 0 3 10 2 5 cm 2 3 1850 sec 0.0 676 570 464 Altitude (km) 35 9 253 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 West East (km) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 0.0 676 570 464 Altitude (km) 35 9 253 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 West East (km) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 2331 sec 0.0 676 570 464 Altitude (km) 35 9 253 West East (km) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 0.0 676 570 464 Altitude (km) 35 9 253 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 West East (km) 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 Figure 4.16c Computer simulation including a background eastward neutral wind and finite Pedersen conductivity in the off-equatorial E region.

This means that the eastward plasma drift inside the plume is smaller than the background plasma drift, and it lags behind the rest of the ionosphere. The result is a tilt toward the west with altitude. 4.3.2 Simulations Including Seeding and Shear Huang and Kelley (1996) have simulated the seeding effect of gravity waves on the ionosphere with and without plasma instabilities. To accomplish this, they included a neutral wind of the form U = ( 16 ˆ a x + 4 ˆ a z ) e i ( ω t − k x x + k z z ) m / s where B remains in the ˆ a y direction to the north. They chose k x = ( 2 π/ 240 ) (rad/km) and k z = ( 2 π/ 60 ) (rad/km), which are reasonable values for a gravity wave perturbation. The values of wind speed and the wave vector are such that"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 165 ∇· U = 0 and also with a downward-phase propagation of the wave (see Chapter 6). The wave frequency is ω = ( 2 π/ 1200 ) (rad/s). It is important to note that no initial plasma perturbation was included. The results are shown in Fig. 4.17, where in Fig. 4.17a, the plasma instability has been turned off by setting g = 0, and only a small perturbation occurs. In the upper panel of Fig. 4.17b gravity is included, and two well-developed uplifts with apogee plumes are created within 40 minutes. In the lower panel the waves’ eastward phase velocity was exactly matched to the plasma velocity at 100 m / s in the simulation. The structures grow only about 15% faster with the spatial resonance condition met in which these two velocities are equal. As conjectured by Kelley et al. (1981), Fig. 4.17b shows that spatial resonance is not required for gravity wave seeding of CEIS. These results show that gravity wave winds alone can seed the instability, not just plasma density perturbations. However, the plasma instability clearly amplifies the plasma drift perturbations, yielding much larger δ E × B drifts than the initial neutral wind. For example, between the times in the upper panels of Fig. 4.17b the average plasma uplift velocity was over 300 m / s compared to w = 4m / s for the initial wind speed. These simulations show that nonlinear processes amplify the initial fluctuations. Initially it was thought that shear flow would only lead to stabilization of CEIS instabilities (see Section 4.2.4). This was borne out by early nonlinear studies. For example, Sekar and Kelley (1998) studied the effect of a shear in the zonal drift coupled with the reversal of the vertical drift velocity on development of CEIS. Due to the shear, the structures tilted toward the east but still were able to penetrate into the topside. This suggests that the stabilizing effect of the shear is not very effective in suppressing CEIS all by itself. But when they reversed the vertical drift part way into the simulation, there was no penetration of the perturbation above the F peak. However, these calculations are not self-consistent with respect to the origin of the shear. Hysell and Kudeki (2004) pointed out that strong shear flow in the bottomside equatorial F region implies a region of retrograde plasma motion, where the plasma drifts rapidly westward in strata where the neutral wind is eastward (see Fig. 4.2 and Chapter 3). By extending the analysis of the elec- trostatic Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) of Keskinen et al. (1988) into the strongly collisional, inhomogeneous limit, they showed that this configuration is inherently unstable. The growth rate of the instability they found was large enough to compete with that of the ionospheric interchange instability, and the range of preferred wavelengths was a better match to the depletion scale-sizes observed during equatorial spread F. They surmised that this shear-driven insta- bility could precondition the ionosphere for interchange instabilities, explaining the relatively early appearance of fully developed irregularity structures after sunset during spread F events. Figure 4.18 shows the results of the numerical simulation of the instability. The initial density profile follows a hyperbolic tangent law below the peak and an exponential decay law above it.

The perturbed potential plotted in the lower panels is the difference between the current potential and that of the initial time step. By time step 16, evidence of shear instability clearly can be seen in the perturbed potential. Here, we find periodic islands or cells of low and high potential straddling the altitude of the shear node. A dominant horizontal wavelength is also clearly evident by time step 16. Lines of constant potential are streamlines of the flow, and the plasma circulates clockwise and counterclockwise around the cells of low and high potential, respectively. By time step 64, the instability has grown to the point of being detectable in the plasma density plot. Here, we find elongated regions of depleted and enhanced plasma penetrating above and below the shear node, respectively. A rotational pattern is suggested by the morphology of the enhancements and depletions, and the circulation cells visible at time step 16 have merged into one or two main cells by time step 64. By time step 90, the unstable flow pattern exhibits a distinct “cat’s eye” sur- rounding the most prominent circulation cell.

The simulation reveals how the collisional shear instability functions. In regions of strong retrograde plasma drift, a vertical Pedersen current flows. The equilibrium configuration is the one in which the current has no divergence. However, if the height of the layer is displaced vertically, appropriate polari- zation electric fields arise to maintain quasi-neutrality. High potential regions above low potential regions result from downward layer displacements, with the reverse holding for upward displacements. This process is clearly evident in the simulation by time step 16. For instability to occur, the convection driven by the polarization electric fields must deform the plasma such that the ini- tial upward and downward perturbations in layer height are amplified. The growth rate depends strongly on the actual shapes of the number density, colli- sion, and velocity profiles in a complicated way that evolves over time with the profiles. In KHI simulations, the waveforms that emerged first had a wavelength of about 30 km. Over time, these transient waveforms tended to coalesce to larger scales. A nonlocal analysis predicted the fastest steady-state growth rate for waves with kL ∼ 1 / 2 where L is the length scale of the shear. Given values of L of about 20 km in the postsunset bottomside, this implies dominant wavelengths as high as 250 km. The airglow data in Fig. 4.7b show clearly how various scales evolve. The arrow shows the bottomside of the equatorial plasma. At the top left, the two large plumes are separated by 500 km whereas in between, finger-like structures are separated by 100 km. By the top right-hand frame, even the finger- like structures had grown in to major plumes. It is arguable that the largest two plumes at the top left were given a head start by a gravity wave–induced fluctua- tion whereas the others were seeded by KHI. Alternatively, KHI might explain all the seeding if the two major plumes in the top left image were launched at the peak altitude of the prereversal enhancement (Kudeki et al., 2007) and then drifted overhead. 4.3.3 Summary of Nonlinear Theory Results The most important result is that plasma depletions push into the linearly stable topside. Other results are as follows: 1. Once an initial seed occurs, subsequent growth depends very little on the scale size of the seed. 2. Plumes can be seeded by plasma density perturbations or by spatially varying electric fields generated by gravity wave wind fields or the collisional KHI instability. 3. Tilting of plumes with altitude is most likely caused by polarization of plumes due to an eastward wind in the plasma reference frame. 4. Plumes with large horizontal scale can create electric fields that penetrate deep into the E layer."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 169 4.4 Linkage of Large and Small Scales in CEIS 4.4.1 Evidence for a Diffusive Subrange We turn now to the studies of the power spectra of convective ionospheric storms and examine the information they contain concerning the physics of these phe- nomena. First, the relationship between density perturbation and electric field structure may be derived from (4.13a), which may be written − ikQ δ n =− ik δφ( Pk / i ) (4.24a) or δ E x = ( Q P ) δ n n which may also be written δ E x =− ( gB ν in ) δ n n (4.24b) where δ E x represents the electric field amplitude. In (4.24b) the electric field is proportional to the density perturbation and thus the shape of the power spectrum of the two quantities, δ E x and δ n / n 0 , should be the same—that is, | δ E | 2 ( δ n / n ) 2 = ( gB ν in ) 2 (4.24c) Since the relationship between δ E x and δ n / n 0 is different for different plasma phenomena, the ratio may be used as a test for sorting out what processes domi- nate the physics as a function of altitude and wave number. The ambipolar electric field due to diffusion (see Chapter 10) is given by δ E = ( k B T / e ) ( ∇ n / n ) =− i k ( k B T / e )(δ n / n ) (4.25) rather than by (4.24b). This expression predicts that the electric field and density fluctuation power spectrum differ by a factor of k 2 due to the presence of the gradient operator. The ratio of simultaneously measured power spectra is presented in Fig. 4.19 for a rocket experiment. The ratio has been plotted to have the units of electric field squared. For the three likely driving sources (gravity, electric field, wind), the corresponding electric field would be gB /ν in , E ,or uB .

The electric field indicated by the dashed line is √ 10 mV / m, which, in turn, indicates a combination of a gravity and a wind-driven process, since the zonal zero-order electric field is not this large. The physics changes dramatically near the 100 m scale where the ratio begins increasing as k 2 .We investigate this transition in the next sections. First, however, we briefly discuss the characteristics of the intermediate wavelength density (or electric field) power spectra. Computer simulations have been used to predict the power spectrum of intermediate wavelength density structures for comparison with experiments (see Fig. 4.5). Keskinen et al. (1980a, b) found isotropic fluctuations at inter- mediate scales with wave number spectra, which displayed a power law of the form k − n with n ≈ 2 . 5. This result is in good agreement with bottomside vertical power spectral measurements on rockets. But horizontal satellite spectra often have spectral indices closer to n = 5 / 3. An explanation for the anisotropic spectra has been proposed by Zargham and Seyler (1987). Their simulation shows a very strong anisotropy in the devel- opment of the irregularities with shock-like structures in the direction of ∇ n . A one-dimensional cut was made through the simulation for near-vertical tra- jectories, and, as shown in Fig. 4.20, the predicted waveforms and their spectra are in excellent agreement with the rocket data in Fig. 4.5a (Kelley et al., 1987).

On the other hand, the observational database is determined primarily by scatter from short-wavelength waves—for example, the 3 m waves detected at Jicamarca. Figure 4.5b shows that 3 m is well into the steep portion of the spectrum. By analogy to neutral turbulence as discussed in Section 3.6, it is tempting to consider the steep portion to be in a dissipative wave number range. The"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"172 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics steep range in fluid turbulence is called the viscous subrange, where the term ( η/ρ) ∇ 2 U in the momentum equation damps out small scale structures. The ∇ 2 operator becomes k 2 in a Fourier analysis, so large values of k are most effec- tive in dissipation. In our linear long-wavelength stability analysis we ignored a crucial term in the continuity equation that comes from the ( V ·∇ n ) term. If we include the diffusion velocity, D ( ∇ n / n ) , we get a term of the form ( D / n ) ∇ 2 n which in a Fourier analysis becomes k 2 D (δ n / n ) , which is analogous to viscous dissipation, and we refer to a diffusive subrange. When included in the linear analysis the total growth rate for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability becomes, γ RT = g /ν in L − k 2 D ⊥ (4.26) But what is the proper perpendicular diffusion coefficient to use in a plasma? We take up this problem next. As noted previously, the lifetime of a horizontal structure in the high-latitude ionosphere depends on how quickly the plasma can diffuse across the magnetic field. Also, whether a particular plasma instability is stable or unstable at a given k value depends on whether some positive contribution to the growth rate exceeds diffusive damping due to terms of the form – k 2 D ⊥ . In Chapter 5 we study parallel diffusion and show that D || = ( 1 + T e / T i ) D i (4.27) The factor of T e / T i comes from the fact that an ambipolar electric field builds up when electrons attempt to diffuse away quickly parallel to B due to their small mass. In effect, each electron has to drag a heavy ion with it along B , and the plasma diffusion coefficient is then determined by the ions. In Chapter 10, perpendicular diffusion in the F region is discussed in some detail. In brief, a charged particle on average random walks one gyroradius, r g , between collisions, so the diffusion coefficient is of the order D j ⊥ = r 2 g ν j (4.28) This quantity is larger for ions than for electrons and results in an ambipolar perpendicular electric field. This field retards ions and accelerates electrons so that the plasma structure diffuses as a unit and at a rate given by the electron diffusion coefficient. However, if the ambipolar electric field is shorted out by a conducting E region, the structure will decay at a rate given by the ion dif- fusion coefficient. Thus, the actual D c ⊥ must fall between the electron and ion rates: D e ⊥ ≤ D c ⊥ ≤ D i ⊥ (4.29)"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 173 That the medium is linearly stable at m scales in the direct RT process now can be seen by comparing the growth g /ν in L to the classical perpendicular dif- fusive damping rate, as in (4.26). Experiments show that the 3 m structures are highly elongated along the magnetic field (Farley and Hysell, 1996; Hysell and Farley, 1996). Parallel diffusion is so fast that the only structures that can be maintained have k ⊥ \u0006 k || so perpendicular and parallel diffusion is comparable. As indicated in (4.29), D c ⊥ may range from a minimum of D e ⊥ to as large as D i ⊥ depending on the conductivity of the E region. The wavelength at which the RT process is marginally stable, that is, where linear growth equals diffusive damping, is then λ c = 2 π ( D c ⊥ ν in L / g ) 1 / 2 (4.30) where λ c is the critical wavelength at marginal stability. This parameter exceeds 10 m for reasonable F-region parameters, even using the smallest value of D c ⊥ (i.e., D e ⊥ ) . The RT process is thus linearly stable in the range where most of the radar observations have taken place—that is, for backscatter from waves with λ ≤ 3 m. If no other wave generation process exists, the 3 m waves must receive energy from the longer scales via a cascade process of some sort. Another possible candidate for meter-scale structure is the collisional drift wave. These waves are driven only by gradients, so they could be a secondary instability due to the primary Rayleigh-Taylor irregularities. However, linear instability studies based on the rocket observations show that such waves are linearly stable (Huba and Ossakow, 1981a, b). This fact, coupled with the fea- tureless k − 5 spectrum for λ ≤ 100 m, seems to rule out unstable drift waves as a source of 3 m waves. As we shall see next, it appears that classical diffusion may be sufficient to explain the spectrum, provided energy can be coupled from growing large-scale waves to small-scale modes damped by diffusion. 4.4.3 Toward a Unified Theory for the Convective Equatorial Ionospheric Storm Spectrum Hysell and Kelley (1997) observed the fluctuation spectrum for several sets of plasma bubbles seen on consecutive orbits of the AE-E satellite, one occurring in the 2200–2300 LT period and the next after midnight LT. This is in the period of decay, and the authors estimated the decay of each range of k space using the model 〈 ∣ ∣ δ n ( k , t + τ)/ n ∣ ∣ 2 〉 = 〈 ∣ ∣ δ n ( k , t )/ n ∣ ∣ 2 〉 k 2 De 2 γ( k )τ (4.31) Remarkably, γ( k ) was the order of − ( 2 × 10 − 4 ) s − 1 and virtually indepen- dent of k . For reference the classical diffusion time constant for D c ⊥ = 0 . 4m 2 / s equals this value for λ = 700 m. So for wavelengths greater than about 500 m, the structures decay faster than the classical rate, and for λ ≤ 500 m, the structures"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"174 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics decay more slowly. It seems clear that energy is being transferred out of larger scales and into small scales analogously to neutral turbulence. Hysell and Kelley (1997) discussed this process in terms of a three-wave interaction, one of which is the damped small scale structure. They also created a structure balance model of the form ∫∫ d k γ( k ) 〈 ∣ ∣ δ n ( k ) ∣ ∣ 2 〉 = ∫∫ d k D eff k 2 〈 ∣ ∣ δ n ( k ) ∣ ∣ 〉 2 to see if classical diffusion represented by a constant value of D eff can explain the observations. To carry out these integrals they created an anisotropic irregularity model 〈 | δ n | 2 〉 / k 2 0 1 + ( k 2 / k 2 0 )( 1 + k 2 x / k 2 1 ) k 0 < k < k 2 (4.32) where k 2 = k 2 x + k 2 z with a x in the zonal direction and a z vertical. This model is meant to represent the spectra from the outer scale, λ o = ( 2 π/ k 0 ) = 60 km, to some inner scale λ 2 = ( 2 π/ k 2 ) . Projected in the a x direction the spectrum has two power law regimes with k − 1 behavior changing to k − 3 form at the wave number k 1 . Projected in the vertical, this model has a spectral slope that ranges from − 1 to − 2. If we take the observed value of γ( k ) to be constant at − ( 2 × 10 − 4 ) s − 1 and use observed values for k 1 and k 2 , the integrals can be carried out and solved for D eff : D eff =− γ ln ( 2 k 1 / k 0 ) k 1 k 2 (4.33) Livingston et al. (1981) have shown that λ 1 ≈ 1000 m. Using k 2 = 2 π/ 80 from Fig. 4.2b yields D eff = 2m 2 / s (4.34) which is higher than the classical electron diffusion coefficient for T e = 1000 K and ν ei = 500 s − 1 but less than the typical ion diffusion coefficient. 4.5 Convective Equatorial Ionospheric Storm Summary Great strides have occurred concerning convective ionospheric storms. Reason- able hypotheses exist for the entire range of observed structures spanning at least six orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.1–105 m). In order of descending scale, these are the possible contributing processes: 1. Gravity wave seeding and electrodynamic uplift ( λ> 200 km) 2. Shear effects (200 km >λ> 20 km)"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 175 3. The generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability (0 . 1km <λ< 20 km) 4. Diffusive damping via wave-wave coupling to damped waves (1 m <λ< 100 m) As an event progresses, the free energy released by the RT process is dissipated via wave-wave coupling, leaving features with λ> 1 km intact in the postmid- night period. Classical diffusion and plasma production via sunlight eventually smooth out the ionosphere. Questions such as “Why do storms occur some nights and not on others?” and “Why are certain seasons preferred at certain locations?” are still open. The E-region conductivity, the plasma uplift by electric fields, and the neutral atmospheric density and dynamics all influence the prob- ability of this phenomenon’s occurrence and must enter any predictive theory. One of the goals of the National Space Weather Program is just such a predictive capability (Kelley et al., 2006; de La Beaujardiere et al., 2006). Progress on these topics requires attacking the following issues: 1. Due to the variable declination of the magnetic field with longitude, the terminator aligns with the magnetic meridian at some locations depending on the season. In this case the two E regions conjugate to the equatorial plasma become dark at the same time, reducing the shorting effect (Tsunoda, 1985). 2. The South Atlantic Anomaly in the earth’s magnetic field causes energetic particle precipitation in that sector, which affects the E-region conductivity and electric field in that sector. This may explain behavior that is not consistent with item 1 above (Burke et al., 2004). 3. The four-wave number behavior of the diurnal tide (Hagan and Forbes, 2002) modu- lates the daytime SQ current system as a function of longitude. In turn, this affects the development of the equatorial arcs and possibly the RT growth rate (Immel et al., 2006; Kil et al., 2007). 4. Knowledge of the global electric field and neutral wind is crucial to predicting CEIS and must come from satellite measurements. 4.6 E-Region Plasma Instabilities: The Observational Data Base As discussed in Chapter 3, the equatorial electrojet is part of the worldwide sys- tem of electric fields and currents driven by the dynamo action of the neutral wind. The dynamo currents primarily flow in the E region where the conduc- tivity is greatest, and the current is essentially horizontal except perhaps at high altitudes and high latitudes. The basic reason for the existence of the equatorial electrojet is the large value of the Cowling conductivity close to the dip equator. In the simplest electrojet model the east-west dynamo electric field E x sets up a vertical polarization field E z , which completely inhibits the vertical Hall current everywhere. The polarization electric field points upward during the day and has about the same magnitude but points downward at night. Thus, the drift velocity of E-region electrons at night is of the same order of magnitude as the daytime drifts, but the electrical current is much smaller due to the low electron density."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"176 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics For the case of zero vertical current, the vertical polarization electric field at the magnetic equator is given by E z = ( 1 + σ H /σ P ) E x (4.35) which can also be written as E z \f (ν i /\b i ) [ E x /( 1 + ν e ν i /\b e \b i ) ] = [ κ − 1 i /( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ] E x (4.36) where \b e , \b i , ν e , and ν i are the usual electron and ion collision frequencies and gyrofrequencies and \u0012 0 = ν e ν i /\b e \b i (see Appendix B for plots of \u0012 0 ). In the equatorial region the east-west electric field is about 0 . 5mV / m, and the maxi- mum vertical polarization field (at about 105 km) is estimated from (4.35) to be of the order of 10–15 mV / m (see also Fig. 3.17b). The electrons are magnetized and therefore the E × B drift under the influence of this vertical field yields an east-west electron drift velocity on the order of 400–600 m / s. The drift direc- tion is westward during the day and eastward at night. This flow is sometimes supersonic; that is, the electrons move faster than the acoustic velocity in the medium. In this section we extend material in the review by Fejer and Kelley (1980) and ask the reader to refer to that publication for numerous references to the early experimental work in this area. The occurrence of an anomalous scattering region in the ionospheric E region close to the dip equator was observed ini- tially from ionosonde records. These echoes were called “equatorial sporadic E” (E sq ) echoes because of their apparent similarity to the sporadic E phenomenon (called E s ) occurring at other latitudes. However, the characteristics and gener- ating mechanisms of these two phenomena are now known to be quite differ- ent. The intensity of the E sq is well correlated with the electrojet strength, and VHF forward-scattering experiments showed that these echoes are field aligned and are caused by scattering from plasma density irregularities immersed in the electrojet. The most important results concerning the physics of the electrojet scattering region have been obtained from VHF radar measurements performed at the Jicamarca Radar Observatory near Lima, Peru, since 1962. Rocket obser- vations at Thumba, India; Punta Lobos, Peru; Kwajalein Island; and Brazil have also provided valuable information on the electrojet irregularities from electric field and density profiles (see Fig. 3.17b). Multifrequency HF and VHF radar observations have been performed in Central and East Africa, India, and Brazil, and VHF/UHF in Peru. Equatorial E-region irregularities are present during both day and night. The irregularities are field aligned; that is, the wave number component along the magnetic field ( k || ) is much less than k ⊥ . Radar echoes are observed only when the radar wave vector is nearly perpendicular to the earth’s magnetic field. The width of the north-south angular spectrum is less than 1 ◦ for 3 m irregularities.

Both electron density and electric field but not magnetic field fluctuations have been detected, indicating an electrostatic wave process. Radar spectral studies have shown the existence of two classes of irregularities, called type 1 and type 2, associated with the electrojet. The characteristics of the type 1 or two-stream (the reason for this name will be clear later) irregularities were determined in the early measurements in Peru. The type 2 irregularities have been studied in detail only with the advent of improved sensitivity at Jicamarca. The line of echoes centered near 100 km in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2 is due to the electrojet waves. The type 1 irregularities have a narrow spectrum with a Doppler shift (120 ± 20 Hz for a 50 MHz radar) that corresponds approximately to the ion acoustic velocity (about 360 m / s) in the electrojet region. These echoes appear nearly simultaneously over a large range of zenith angles when the electron drift velocity is larger than a certain value.

The mean Doppler shift of the peak in the spectrum was constant when the zenith angle was between 45 ◦ and 70 ◦ , both to the east and to the west (Bowles et al., 1960). This result remained mysterious until combined rocket and radar data were applied (Kelley et al., 2008). As discussed in Section 4.8.2, they showed that in these scattering volumes there is some region where the total vector drift velocity (zero order plus perturbation drift) in the direction of the radar exceeds the two-stream threshold. Thus, the hypothesis that V ph = C s cos θ , where θ is the angle between the total drift velocity and the radar beam, explains the observation V ph ∼ = C s at all angles. The data in Fig. 4.21 were normalized to a peak value, since the echo power varies over a large range (up to about 40 dB) throughout the day. Thus, the area below the spectral curves is not proportional to the relative signal strength. In particular, the scattered power from the oblique type 1 echoes is appreciably larger than the power from the overhead echoes coming from vertically traveling “non-two-stream” irregularities. During the daytime the Doppler shift of the dominant peak is positive when the antenna is directed toward the east and negative when the antenna is looking to the west. The reverse is true at night. Therefore the phase velocity of the type 1 irregularities has a component in the direction of the electron flow, since during the day (night) the electron flow is westward (eastward). The fact that the Doppler shift is independent of zenith angle shows that the irregularities are not just advecting with the zero-order electron flow. Often, the vertical antenna detects echoes with both positive and negative spectral peaks corresponding to the acoustic speed; that is, propagating perpendicular to the flow both upward and downward. The average phase velocity of the type 2 irregularities is smaller than the ion acoustic velocity and is approximately proportional to the cosine of the radar elevation angle (Balsley, 1969a). The spectral width is much broader than that of the type 1 echoes and is often greater than the mean Doppler shift. Figure 4.22 shows the variation of the type 2 spectra and average phase velocity with zenith angle. The solid curves in the bottom right panel indicate the expected variation of the average velocity V obs as a function of zenith angle θ z on the basis of the relation V obs = V D sin θ z for three values of the drift velocity V D . The excellent agreement between the experimental and theoretical variations shows that the type 2 phase velocity is proportional to the projection of the electrojet drift velocity on the radar line-of-sight. Some additional characteristics of the type 1 and type 2 irregularities deduced from radar data are as follows: 1. Threshold : Type 2 irregularities are observed even for very small values of the west- ward electron drift velocity during daytime. Ionosonde and radar measurements have shown that the irregularities are absent during the occasional daytime periods of westward current flow (counterelectrojet conditions). At nighttime the type 2 irreg- ularities are almost always observed. An exception occurs when the electric field reverses sign. An example of this effect can be seen in Fig. 4.1.

It seems clear that the zonal electric field that causes the F layer to move vertically switched from east to west at this time, going through zero in the process. A dra- matic example of the effect of electric field changes is shown in Fig. 4.23. Before 2044, the radar echoes came from two height ranges. For about 10 minutes they disappeared completely, only to return again with one echoing layer exactly mid- way between the original two echo heights. Thus, a very small threshold electric field seems to be required for type 2 echoes. There is a definite electric field threshold for the excitation of type 1 irregularities, however. These echoes are observed only when the electron drift velocity is somewhat larger than the ion acoustic velocity (about 360 m / s). 2. Scattering cross section : The scattering cross section of the type 2 irregularities is approximately proportional to the square of the drift velocity but is independent of zenith angle, while the type 1 scattering cross section increases rapidly with zenith angle, peaking near the horizon. This is where the radar beam is almost parallel to the electron flow in the electrojet. 3. Altitude dependence of the electrojet echoes : Fejer et al. (1975) studied the verti- cal structure of the electrojet scattering region in detail and reported a considerable difference in the echoing region between day and night. Figure 4.24 shows some selected profiles of the electrojet scattered power on February 18–19, 1971, which were observed at Jicamarca using an altitude resolution of 3 km.

The daytime power profile as a function of height shows a single peak that remains at a constant altitude (about 103 km). The nighttime scattering is much more structured. Plume-like rising structures in the altitude region of 115 to 125 km with upward Doppler velocities were also observed during nighttime from off-equatorial regions (Patra and Rao, 1999). 4. Wavelength dependence : The vast majority of data concerning the electrojet is, of course, at 3 m wavelength. Interferometric techniques have been introduced at Jicamarca, which show that the scattering cells are often organized into kilometer- scale wave structures that propagate horizontally at about one-half the acoustic speed. An example is shown in Fig. 4.25. The most intense backscatter (darkest regions) is related to vertical 3 m waves traveling at the acoustic speed. It seems clear that the large-scale wave is organizing and creating the conditions that produce the vertically propagating acoustic waves. Notice that one wave period requires about 60 s to pass over Jicamarca in this example. Occasionally during magnetic activity or special tidal conditions, the daytime electrojet current reverses sign, a counter electrojet. Radar observations in such conditions find that two-stream waves obey the relationship V ph = C s cos θ (Hanuise and Crochet, 1981; Woodman and Chau, 2002). During such con- ditions the relative directions of the vertical gradient and the electric field are stable. This means that there is no situation for which both two-stream and gradient drift are unstable and large-scale waves do not occur. These results are in agreement with auroral zone data (Bahcivan et al., 2005; see Chapter 10) and a new interpretation of type 1 radar scattering properties as a function of angle (see Section 4.8.2)."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 181 Jicamarca 18–19 February 1971 123 1230 1300 1530 1600 1330 1400 1630 1700 2300 1430 1500 1730 1800 1830 1900 1930 2030 2100 2130 2200 2230 2330 0000 0200 0025 0100 0130 0230 0300 93 123 93 123 93 123 93 0204060 Height (km) Relative echo power (dB) 0330 0400 0430 0500 0530 0600 Figure 4.24 Sample of the 50 MHz backscattering power profiles from the electrojet irregularities measured with the large vertically directed incoherent scatter antenna at Jicamarca.

Most of the early rocket experiments (prior to 1983) were flown with relatively high apogees and thus passed through the electrojet very quickly. Such high velocities preclude detec- tion of the large-scale waves discussed previously. Nonetheless, some impor- tant results were obtained, particularly due to the pioneering efforts of the Indian rocket group (e.g., Prakash et al., 1972). Examples of simultaneous den- sity profiles and density fluctuation measurements taken during daytime and nighttime conditions are shown in Fig. 4.26.

Between these regions, an upward gradient exists and the fluctuations are both patchy and extend to high frequencies.

The data show very intense alternating electric fields organized in large-scale features very reminiscent of the radar data shown in Fig. 4.25. In fact, large-scale waves of this type were detected by the radar between 103 and 106 km and were a primary launch criterion for the rocket flight. It is of interest to note that as the rocket altitude increased from 92 to 106 km, the signal changed qualitatively from a turbulent sinusoid to a squared- off and seemingly saturated waveform. Similar features were detected during the downleg. In the lower half of Fig. 4.29, a short time interval is blown up to better show the steep edges and saturation-like waveforms.

These mechanisms result from plasma instabilities known as the two-stream instability and the gradient drift (also known as the cross-field instability). Many features of the type 1 irregularities are explained by a modified two- stream instability theory developed independently by Farley (1963), using kinetic"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"188 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics theory, and by Buneman (1963), using the Navier-Stokes equation. They have shown that the plasma is unstable for waves propagating in a cone of angle φ about the plasma drift velocity such that V D cos φ> C s . For smaller drift velocities the plasma still can be unstable, provided there is a plasma density gradient of zero order oriented in the right direction relative to the electric field driving the electrons. This instability was first studied by Simon (1963) and Hoh (1963) for laboratory plasmas and is termed the gradient drift instability. Many features of the type 2 radar echoes are explained by this instability. We first investigate the linear theory for the two-stream instability. The linear theory is important because two-stream waves have been observed to move with a phase speed of the order of the ion-acoustic speed (which is not necessarily isothermal and which matches the phase speed at the instability linear threshold), no matter what exact nonlinear mechanism has produced them. We will start with the isothermal linear theory. Consider the zero-order condition in which the electrons stream east with a velocity V D ˆ a x driven by a vertically downward zero-order polarization electric field − E z 0 ˆ a z (see Chapter 3). This corresponds to nighttime conditions. The ions are assumed to be at rest to zero order due to the high collision frequency ( ν in \u0006 \b i ). For the moment we ignore any zero-order plasma gradient. Perturbations in density, electrostatic potential, and velocity are of the form δ ne i (ω t − kx ) , δφ e i (ω t − kx ) , and δ V e i (ω t − kx ) , and we have taken k to be in the ˆ a x direction ( k = k ˆ a x ) , which is perpendicular to B = B ˆ a y . The linearized electron continuity equation, ignoring production and loss, which are assumed to be in equilibrium in the zero-order equations, is i ωδ n + V D ( − ik δ n ) − ikn 0 δ V ex = 0 (4.37) where the second term comes from the ( V ·∇ n ) term and the third from n ( ∇· V ). In this expression the common factor e i (ω t − kx ) has been factored out. Notice that since k is horizontal and there is no vertical gradient, the vertical perturbation drift does not change the electron density. Equation (4.37) can be rewritten as δ V ex = ( ω/ k − V D ) ( δ n / n ) (4.38a) where the subscript zero has been dropped from the mean density n 0 . Notice that we have already assumed quasi-neutrality by using δ n as a variable rather than δ n e . In the electron momentum equation the term md V e / dt is dropped because of the small electron mass, leaving 0 = ( − e / m ) ( E + V e × B ) − ( k B T e / m ) ( ∇ n / n ) − ν e V e where again we ignore gravity and where ν e is the electron-neutral collision frequency. We simplify ν en and ν in to ν e and ν i in the E region.

In the z compo- nent of the momentum equation, the zero-order electric field and electron drift terms cancel in the equilibrium state about which we are making our perturba- tions.

We can now use these mathematical results to gain insight into the physical instability mechanisms involved. First, from the electron continuity equation we have δ V e x = ( ω/ k − V D ) δ n / n (4.41) But using the two electron momentum equations [(4.38b) and (4.38c)] we also must have δ V e x =− [ ν e /( \b 2 e + ν 2 e )] [ ( ike δφ/ m ) − ( ikk B T e / m ) (δ n / n ) ] (4.42) If we study the properties of the wave near marginal stability where γ = 0 (or equivalently assume ω r \u0006 γ) , we can replace ( ω/ k − V D ) by (ω r / k − V D ) , which in turn becomes − ( \u0012 0 / [ 1 + \u0012 0 ] ) V D , using (4.38a). Setting (4.41) and (4.42) equal and using this result yield [ ν e /( \b 2 e + ν 2 e )] ( ike δφ/ m ) = [ ν e ( ikk B T e / m )( \b 2 e + ν 2 e ) + \u0012 0 V D / ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ] (δ n / n ) Now if we note that δ E x = ik δφ and V D = E z 0 / B , where E z 0 is the zero-order vertical electric field, this may be written [ ν e e / m ( \b 2 e + ν 2 e )] δ E x = [ ν e ( ikk B T e / m ) /( \b 2 e + ν 2 e ) + \u0012 0 E z 0 / B ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ] δ n / n and finally, δ E x / E z 0 = { \u0012 0 ( \b 2 e + ν 2 e )/ [ ν e \b e ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ] + ikk B T e / eE z 0 } δ n / n (4.43) This expression shows that the relationship between δ E x and δ n / n is wave- length dependent. For long wavelengths, the second term in the bracket is negli- gible and δ E x and δ n are either in phase or 180 ◦ out of phase, depending on the sign of E z 0 . Using the good approximation that \b e \u0006 ν e and \u0012 0 = ν e ν i /\b e \b i we have for this case δ E x E z 0 = ν i \b i ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) δ n n (4.44)"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 191 This is very similar to the result found earlier for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability [i.e., (4.24b)]. The wavelength at which the magnitudes of the first and second terms in (4.43) are equal for T i = T e (i.e., C 2 s = 2 k B T e / M ) is given by λ c = π C 2 s ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ν i V D Setting \u0012 0 = 0 . 22 at an altitude of 105 km , C s = V D = 360 m / s and ν i = 2 . 5 × 10 3 s − 1 yields λ c \f 0 . 4 m. This wavelength is thus quite small and for most wavelengths of interest we may use (4.44) to relate the perturbed electric field to the density. Using these results, the instability process can now be understood from Fig. 4.32a. The figure is drawn for daytime conditions with the vertical elec- tric field upward. The sinusoidal wave can thus represent both δ n / n and δ E x for λ \u0006 λ c . That is, the eastward perturbation δ E x is positive when δ n / n is positive.

Consider the ion motion expressed by (4.38e). The real part of the equation corresponds to the ion velocity in phase with the wave. The ( + ik δφ) term is just the electric field, δ E x , which is also in phase and thus is included in the real part of the expression. The imaginary part gives the out- of-phase motion at the spatial positions where δ n / n and δ E x both vanish and thus the part of the ion motion that causes the wave to grow or decay. The two vectors, pressure gradient force and inertial force, are shown in Fig. 4.32a. For growth, the ion inertial force must be larger than the pressure term so that the plasma moves horizontally from low density to high density. This in turn requires that ω r δ V i x > k ( k B T i / M ) (δ n / n ) (4.45) In other words, the ion inertial force must be greater than the pressure gradient force that is trying to smooth out the density enhancement by diffusion. Using (4.38d) to eliminate δ V i x , equation (4.45) can also be written as ω r ω/ k 2 > ( k B T i / M ) Near marginal stability, γ \u000e ω r ,so ω \f ω r , and using the dispersion relation (4.40a) for ω r / k we have the requirement that V D / ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) > ( k B T i / M ) 1 / 2 (4.46) This is almost but not quite the required threshold condition for growth. The exact result, V D > ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) C s , came out of the detailed determinant analysis, since the electron pressure term adds to the ion pressure via the ambipolar diffu- sion effect. Ion inertia is thus the destabilizing factor in the two-stream instability, whereas ambipolar diffusion causes damping. Zero-order temperatures in the E region are usually such that T i = T e = T n = T . Then, if the wave process behaves isothermally, the ion acoustic speed is C 2 s = 2 k B T / M . Farley and Providakes (1989) noted that the threshold speed of short-scale E-region irregularities should be evaluated more carefully, based on their observations of high latitude E-region irregularities moving with phase speeds that were clearly faster than the isothermal ion-acoustic speed and much closer to a speed associated with adiabatic electrons: C 2 s = γ i T i + γ e T e M where γ i , e are the specific heats at constant volume for the ion and electron gases. For low-frequency waves, cooling will act quickly enough that both gases behave isotropically and γ i = γ e = 1. At high frequencies, the behavior of one or both gases may become adiabatic with a corresponding γ = 5 / 3, which will increase the phase velocity. However, since wave phase velocities approach V D in the"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 193 upper electrojet, the wave frequency in the drift frame becomes small and the electrons may again be isothermal (Hysell et al., 2007). St.-Maurice et al. (2003) reported observations of two-step type-I waves in the lower equatorial electrojet moving at speeds higher even than in adia- batic processes and up to 50% higher than the isothermal ion acoustic speed. They named such behavior super-adiabatic and found that only the theory by St.-Maurice and Kissack (2000), which included electron thermal corrections, could explain these waves. The next step, exploring aspect sensitivity (Kagan and St.-Maurice, 2004), showed good correspondence to observations (Kudeki and Farley, 1989) and good qualitative agreement with the observed altitude behavior of Farley-Buneman waves: super-adiabatic at lower altitudes and isothermal at high altitudes. The correspondence of linear phase velocities at marginal stability to observations stimulated further linear theory with nonisothermal electrons, as reported by Kissack et al. (2007a, b). These papers additionally account for nonzero flow angles (essentially the angle between the E × B direction and the center of the radar beam, important for nonzero zenith angle transmissions) and an arbitrary heat source (with possible applications for high latitudes and heating experiments). A step forward by Kissack et al. (2007a, b) was the presentation of thermal corrections, which showed contributions from each physical process. They were also able to recover the results of preceding linear theories. To test the wavelength dependence predicted by the Kissack et al. theory, Kagan and Kissack (2007) analyzed the multi(3)-frequency experiment of Balsley and Farley (1971) in Jicamarca. Their theoretical predictions showed good corre- spondence to observations. They also showed that, depending on the frequency of two-stream waves, their altitude behavior changes from super-adiabatic at lower altitudes to isothermal at higher altitudes. The transitional process from super-adiabatic to isothermal is dominated by inelastic electron energy exchange and therefore is much more important at low radar frequencies.

From Fig. 4.32b, after essentially dominating all altitudes at 16 MHz, this transitional process clearly covers a smaller altitude range and moves to higher altitudes at 50 MHz, then disappears completely at 146 MHz. A direct transi- tion from super-adiabatic to isothermal processes results in a sudden drop in the phase velocity of two-stream waves that could be observed if the radar altitude resolution were less than the height of the transitional region (of about 2 km). This was first reported at 50 MHz by Swartz (1997). Kagan et al. (2008) also observed a sudden change in V ph with the newly employed Prototype Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR-P) at the Jicamarca Radio Obser- vatory. AMISR-P was operated at 430 MHz and had an altitude resolution of 0 . 6 km at vertical incidence. Range-velocity-intensity plots and individual nor- malized spectra of these AMISR-P data are shown in the left-hand column of Fig. 4.32c. In the right-hand column of Fig. 4.32c, these observations, plotted together with theoretically predicted phase velocities, show good correspondence between theory and experiment. For an equatorial electrojet between 100 and 120 km altitudes, Kagan and Kissack (2007) offer a simpler and more explicit expression for a phase veloc- ity of Farley-Buneman waves, that is valid with less than 3% uncertainty. Since observational uncertainty is usually much more than 3%, the Kagan and Kis- sack (2007) formula is handy for quick estimates and is easy to program. Their Eq. (4.47) following allows easy tracking of wave phase velocity dependence on its wave number and facilitates thermal corrections to the classical expression, contributions from non-zero flow angles, and dominating physical processes such as thermal conduction and inelastic electron cooling.

All of the thermal processes’ effects and wave number dependences of the phase velocity are included in the second term under the square root of Eq. (4.47). The greatest effect of the flow angle on the phase velocity is in the first term in the numerator, which describes the Dimant-Sudan instability (Dimant and Sudan, 1997). This term vanishes at 0- and 90-degree flow angles and disappears at higher altitudes. The Dimant-Sudan instability has a cut-off at high wave num- bers (or frequencies) so that, for example, at 430 MHz, the change in the flow angle does not affect V ph . This instability occurs for negative flow angles cor- responding to the radar looking east for a daytime equatorial electrojet. For positive flow angles corresponding to western transmissions, the Dimant-Sudan thermal instability might still be induced but requires significantly higher thresh- old velocities than the ion-acoustic speed. Thus, if any radar returns are observed at lower frequencies ( ≤ 50 MHz), the phase velocity of type 1 irregularities would be higher than for the east and vertical (if the latter are not smeared by gradient- drift processes) transmissions. In an isothermal treatment, Eq. (4.47) reduces to the classical expression in which the phase velocity does not depend on the transmitted frequency. Turning to the gradient drift instability, we must include the change of density due to advection from the vertical perturbation electron drift in the electron continuity equation. The term comes from V ·∇ n , which in linearized form adds a term 1 / kL to the first row, second column of the determinant where L = [ ( 1 / n )( dn / dz ) ] − 1 is the zero-order vertical gradient scale length. This added term changes only the imaginary part of ω ; the real part is identical. This means that (4.43) also relates the perturbed field δ E x to the density perturbation δ n / n for the gradient drift mode. To study the stability condition, consider Fig. 4.32b, which shows daytime conditions and includes a zero-order density gradient that is upward. From Fig. 4.32b it is clear that the gradient is a destabilizing factor when it is upward since then the upward perturbation drift δ V e z = δ E x / B occurs in a region where the density is already depleted (δ n < 0 ) . That is, a low-density region is convected upward into a region of higher background density, causing a growth in the relative value of δ n / n . If the gradient is reversed in sign but the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 197 E z 0 is left the same, the perturbation electric fields will cause high-density plasma to drift into higher-density regions, which is stabilizing. Thus, for instability the zero-order vertical electric field must have a component parallel to the zero- order density gradient. At the equator during normal daytime conditions (see Chapter 3), the unstable gradient direction is upward since E z 0 is upward, while at night the unstable gradient is downward. There is no threshold drift requirement for the gradient drift instability in the physics thus far. However, if recombination is considered, a term in the continuity equations of the form − α n 2 must be included which, when linearized, becomes of the form − 2 α n 0 δ n and a finite threshold thus exists for the gradient drift process. Fejer et al. (1975) found that the electron drift threshold velocity for instability to occur is given by V D > L [ 2 α n 0 ( 1 + \u0012 0 )( \b i /ν i ) + ( k 2 C 2 s ν e /ν i \b e ) ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ] Finally, following Fejer et al. (1975), the complete linear theory must include a finite zero-order ion drift velocity V Di and the possibility of an arbitrary k vector (but still perpendicular to B ), yielding the following set of expressions for the linear theory of both the gradient drift and two-stream modes: ω r = k · ( V D + \u0012 V Di ) /( 1 + \u0012) (4.48a) γ = ( 1 + \u0012 ) − 1 { ( \u0012/ν i ) [ ( ω r − k · V Di ) 2 − k 2 C 2 s ]} + ( 1 / Lk 2 ) {( ω r − k · V Di ) ( ν i /\b i ) k x } − 2 α n 0 (4.48b) with \u0012 = \u0012 0 [( k 2 ⊥ / k 2 ) + ( \b 2 e /ν 2 e )( k 2 x / k 2 )] (4.49) and under the assumption that γ \u000e ω r . If the latter assumption is relaxed, Kudeki et al. (1982) have shown that waves with λ \f L propagate more slowly; that is, a more exact result for the linear theory with k · B = V Di = 0 is given by ω r + i γ = k · V D ( 1 + ik 0 / k ) /[ ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ( 1 + k 2 0 / k 2 )] (4.50) where k 0 = ( ν i / L \b i ) / ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) . This is the linear theory for large scale waves. Finally, we note that recombination is much more important during daytime con- ditions than nighttime, since the zero-order density is large and 2 α n 0 is sizable.

Such waves are weak in the middle data set and are not seen at all in the lowest set of data. In the center data set the conditions were close to two-stream instability and the wave activity was stronger than in the case of the lowest data set. However, in both the center and lowest data set the waves were restricted primarily to the region of upward vertical density gradient. Those data are thus in excellent detailed agreement with linear theory. The fluid theory discussed thus far breaks down at short wavelengths and a kinetic approach is necessary. Such calculations have been carried out by Farley (1963) and more recently by Schmidt and Gary (1973). Pfaff et al. (1987b) compared Schmidt and Gary’s calculation of γ( k ) with the spectrum of electric field fluctuations measured in the CONDOR rocket flight during pure two-stream conditions (above the density gradient) as shown in Fig. 4.34. The two plots are remarkably similar. This strongly suggests that pure two-stream waves grow in a narrow range of wave numbers near the peak in their linear growth rate.

(1973) provides a conceptual framework from which several properties of the fully developed turbulence can be understood. The basic idea is that “primary” waves reach sufficiently large amplitudes that the perturbation electric fields and density gradients are themselves large enough to drive “secondary” waves unstable. For example, referring to the observational data from the CONDOR flights in Fig. 4.29, the primary δ E is horizontal, so if it is large enough, δ E / B will drive two-stream waves in the vertical direction. Indeed, the rocket electric field measurements show that the perturbation electric fields can be of the order of ( 1 + \u0012) C s B . This is illustrated in Fig. 4.35a, in which the horizontal electric field fluctuation strength has been divided by B and plotted as a function of altitude for the upleg and downleg of the rocket flight. The dotted lines show the threshold velocity for a secondary two-stream instability given by C s ( 1 + \u0012) . The first thing to note is that between 100 and 105 km the observed perturbation electric field is sufficiently strong to generate a vertical two-stream instability. The region where these waves can be generated agrees remarkably well with the region where vertical up- and downgoing two-stream waves were detected simultaneously by the Jicamarca radar. It is safe to say that vertically propagating two-stream waves are created by large-amplitude horizontal electric fields associated with long- wavelength gradient drift waves. Quantitatively, one can evaluate the required amplitude of the primary waves as follows. As summarized by Fejer and Kelley (1980), the oscillation frequency and growth rate of vertically propagating secondary waves are given by ω r ( k s ) =− k s ( \b e /ν e ) ( \u0012 V D / ( 1 + \u0012 ) 2 ) A sin δ (4.51) γ ( k s ) = (\u0012/ 1 + \u0012) { − ( \b 2 e /ν 2 e ) ( k p V D / 2 ) [ \u0012 A 2 / ( 1 + \u0012 ) 2 ] sin ( 2 δ) + ( 1 /ν i ) [ ω ( k s ) 2 − k 2 s C 2 s ]} .

The figure demonstrates why vertical two-stream waves were only detected in the narrow region of roughly 100–107 km for this day. [After Pfaff et al. (1987b).

Such waves were detected during the CONDOR rocket flight with radar and in situ probes. 4.8.2 On the Observations That the Phase Velocity of Type I Equatorial Waves Is Independent of Angle In Chapter 10 we describe the results of auroral zone studies of type 1 electrojet echoes. With a near vertical magnetic field and highly variable flow direction, it is possible to measure the phase velocity as a function of angle. Bahcivan et al. (2005) have conclusively shown that the relation V ph = C s cos θ is the best match to the observations. The implication is that the waves travel at the threshold for instability. This result seems at odds with the classic observation in the equatorial electrojet that the phase velocity is C s , independent of the angle to the flow. In addition, this result is in disagreement with linear theory, which, for ψ small, predicts a wave phase velocity equal to V D cos θ where θ is the angle between the current and the radar beam and V D is the flow velocity. The key to understanding the equatorial results is based on two important factors (Kelley et al., 2008). First, the drift velocity of importance is the total drift velocity, which is equal to the vector sum of the zero-order horizontal drift and the drift induced by intense, large-scale waves. Second, a radar will respond to the most intense wave in the field of view, so it will detect a narrow Doppler shift at the value C s cos θ , corresponding to the projection of the largest line-of-sight velocity. The horizontal wavelength of daytime large scale waves is in the range of 2–3 km (Kudeki et al., 1987) and is coherent over an altitude range of 4 km. The vertical drift data presented in Fig. 4.35a can be used along a horizontal drift, based on the rocket data in Fig. 3.17b, to create a vector drift velocity on a two-dimensional grid. Figure 4.35b shows how this region would be interrogated by the JULIA radar at two different zenith angles for the system beam width and range resolution and the same for the AMISR-P at its maximum zenith angle of 20 ◦ . The red crosses in the figure correspond to regions in which the total velocity exceeded the factor (1 + \u0012 0 ) C s and for which the value of cos θ exceeded 0.9, where θ is the angle between the beam and the total flow velocity. For this purpose we used the isothermal value for C s . The first criterion assures that the total drift velocity exceeds the threshold for instability. Now almost certainly, the most intense waves are those with a phase velocity vector nearest the flow angle, implying that the radar will preferentially detect such waves if they are in the range gate and will thus register their Doppler velocity. By our criterion, this echo will be registered at a phase velocity in excess of 0 . 9 C s . At the equator, clearly the radars will always see a near constant Doppler shift as a function of angle when the horizontal drift velocity is large and intense, large scale waves are present. The long-standing problem thus seems resolved."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 203 0 50 100 150 0 50 100 150 Ground rang e (km) Alt i tud e (km) Condor v e loc i t ie s w i th AMISR v e rt i cal, AMISR 20° JULIA v e rt i cal, JULIA 23 \u0002 and JULIA 51 \u0002 w e st b e ams Figure 4.35b Regions in which these radars would record a Doppler shift ≥ . 0 . 9 C s in the presence of a zero-order horizontal drift, as in Fig. 3.17b, and vertical perturbation drifts, as in Fig. 4.35a, are indicated in red.

These studies permit a detailed comparison between theoretical results and the radar and rocket data. McDonald et al. (1974, 1975) studied numerically the nonlinear evolution of small-scale ( λ \f 10 m) type 2 irregularities by using a grid of 50 × 50 points with a mesh spacing of 1 . 5 m in both horizontal and vertical directions. They observed that intermediate wavelengths ( λ< 28 m) are excited only after the large-scale primary horizontally propagating waves grow to an amplitude of 4%, consistent with the “two-step” theory outlined previously. The quasi-final state is highly turbulent and almost two-dimensionally isotropic, in agreement with the radar observations. Figure 4.36 shows the saturated nonlinear development of the gradient drift irregularities found in these simulations. In the turbulent state the small-scale irregularities have upward and downward motions with speeds comparable to the background horizontal drift. The two-dimensional power spectra of (δ n / n ) 2 and (δ E ) 2 were found to be proportional to k − 3 . 5 . This implies a one-dimensional spectrum varying as k − 2 . 5 .

The approach is best suited to zero-order conditions such that V D < C s , and they therefore were able to apply Kadomtsev’s (1965) strong turbulence-weak coupling equations to the gradient drift turbulence. These equations are, essentially, the Fourier- transformed version of the direct interaction approximation developed by Kraichnan (1967). One of the crucial features is that the nonlinear damping rate due to wave emission and cascade is much larger than the linear damping rate because these waves interact for a long time. This in turn relies on the fact that the waves are almost dispersionless and therefore all the waves have nearly equal group velocities. Farley (1985) has reviewed this theory, and we follow his approach here. The object is to predict the two-dimensional spectrum of den- sity fluctuation turbulence I k ( k ) such that the total density fluctuation strength (dimensionless) is given by 〈 ( \f n / n ) 2 〉 = ∫∫ I k ( k ) d ⊥ k For isotropic turbulence in the plane perpendicular to B = B ˆ a y , I k ( k ) = I k ( k ) where k = ∣ ∣ k ∣ ∣ = ( k 2 x + k 2 z ) 1 / 2 The goal is to derive a differential equation for I k ( k ) that describes the flow of energy in the system as a function of k . There are two main effects: the linear"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 205 growth rate, which includes both linear growth and damping, and the nonlinear flow of energy from eddy to eddy through the spectrum. In a steady state the input of energy at long wavelengths equals the dissipation at short wavelengths. The eddy process forms a mechanism to transfer energy from the growth por- tion of the spectrum to the region where damping is strongest. The argument goes as follows. In a range of wave numbers, \f k , the total density fluctuation strength is (\f n / n ) 2 \f k = ∫ \f k I k 2 π kdk \f 2 π I k k \f k If we consider the range \f k = k / 2 π , that is, a bandwidth in k space equal to k / 2 π , then (\f n / n ) 2 \f k \f k 2 I k Since from (4.44) δ V / V D = [ ν i /\b i ( 1 + \u0012 0 ) ] (δ n / n ) , we also see that in this range of \f k the velocity fluctuation strength is given by δ V 2 \f k ∝ V 2 D k 2 I k Now the classical turbulence argument is that the eddy decay rate ( \u0019 k ) is given by the inverse of the eddy turnover time τ k , where \u0019 k = ( τ k ) − 1 = k δ V \f k ∝ V D k 2 ( I k ) 1 / 2 This is the time it takes for the material in the eddy to move one eddy scale size ( k − 1 ). The total energy ε k in a given eddy is proportional to the δ V 2 \f k given above, so the rate of energy loss is given by ( ε k /τ k ) \f k = ε k \u0019 k ∝ V 3 D k 4 I 3 / 2 k (4.56) The rate of energy gain or loss in the same wavelength band from the linear growth and damping processes is determined by the linear growth/damping rate γ k averaged over all angles at wavelength k . In a time-stationary steady state it must be the case that the spectrum ε k ( k ) has the property that kd / dk ( ε k \u0019 k ) = γ k ε k (4.57) so the steady-state energy spectral density remains the same in any k interval.

The value of the power law index for E ( x ) = xI ( x ) is the same as the value that would be mea- sured by a one-dimensional cut through the turbulent plasma using devices that measure either ( δ n / n ) 2 or ( δ E ) 2 since the one-dimensional measurement spec- trum integrates out one power of k and has the same shape as xI ( x ) (proportional to kI k ) . The power law regime occurs only for large S and occurs in regime II in Fig. 4.37, where the eddy growth rate dominates the linear growth, correspond- ing to the inertial subrange in neutral turbulence theory (Kolmogorov, 1941). It is interesting that the same one-dimensional spectral form is predicted for this plasma case as for the three-dimensional neutral fluid turbulence in the inertial subrange. For finite S , the spectrum becomes very steep at large k , corresponding to the viscous subrange in neutral turbulence and, in the present case, is due to diffusive damping. For S infinite or negative, the fluid theory breaks down due to the excitation of short-wavelength waves, which require a kinetic description. There are a number of ways to check this theory. First, the numerical simula- tions may be tested against the analytic expression (4.59). The numerical results of McDonald et al. (1974, 1975) and Keskinen et al. (1979) seem to disagree with the prediction since they report I k ∝ k − 3 . 5 rather than k − 11 / 3 . This problem can be reconciled as shown in Fig. 4.38. The data points in this figure come from the simulation work reported by Keskinen et al. (1979). The curved line is a fit to the analytic calculation of Sudan (1983) described above for k d = 15 k s , where k s is the wave number corresponding to the physical size of the grid. The fit is quite good but it must be realized that k c , the outer scale for the process, must be considerably smaller than k s to yield such a steep slope in the range of k space plotted. For smaller values of k (not plotted), Sudan’s calculations yield a power spectrum of k − 2 . 67 . Presumably, if the simulations and theory are in agreement and if the simulation occurred in a larger “box,” the calculated power spectra would yield a k − 2 . 67 two-dimensional power law at small k . However, such a result has not yet been obtained in any simulation and the comparison shown in Fig. 4.38 must remain somewhat suspect. 4.8.4 Nonlinear Studies of Farley-Buneman (FB) Waves Linear theory gives conditions for the onset of an instability and characteris- tics of the initial growing waves but cannot explain saturation or provide the amplitude and spectral characteristics of developed turbulence. A number of theoretical models have been developed to explain saturated FB waves. Hamza and St.-Maurice (1993a, b) proposed a strongly turbulent mode-coupling the- ory based upon a two-fluid model. Another approach, developed by Albert and Sudan (1991), Sahr and Farley (1995), Otani and Oppenheim (1998), Dimant (2000), and Otani and Oppenheim (2006), uses a truncated three-wave mode- coupling dynamic model to explain instability saturation.

[After Sudan (1983). Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] Two-dimensional simulations of equatorial Farley-Buneman waves have enabled researchers to understand a number of key electrojet observations. They show that the dominant nonlinearity arises when the perturbed electric fields interact with the density perturbations and drive energy into modes that are lin- early stable or damped. This wave-wave interaction modifies the linear behavior of the waves in a number of observable ways. It leads to mode coupling that saturates the waves when \u0011| δ E |\u0012 ∼ E 0 where \u0011| δ E |\u0012 is the average amplitude of the perturbed electric field generated by the waves. This causes a broadening of the turbulent spectrum and also reduces the expected dominant phase veloc- ity below that predicted by linear theory (Oppenheim and Otani, 1996). This results from mode coupling when the perturbed fields of secondary modes, on average, reduce or cancel the driving field, E 0 , of the primary modes. This model and the two-dimensional simulations do not predict a strict saturation of the phase velocity at the sound-speed as was inferred from the data by Hanuise and Crochet (1981), Makarevitch et al. (2002), and others. Rather, they predict a saturated phase velocity traveling at roughly the sound speed times the cosine"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 209 = n E 0 \u0002 J e V d B 0 2 2222222 2222222 2 1 1111111 1111111 1 \u0002 J \u0002 v \u0002 E \u0002 J \u0002 v \u0002 E \u0002 E \u0002 J \u0002 v \u0002 E \u0002 J \u0002 v x z Figure 4.39 Schematic representation of wave-driven currents in the equatorial electro- jet.

At the density maxima and minima, we show the direction of the perturbed electric field, δ E , the direction in which the electrons drift in response to δ E , δ v , and the resulting electron current, δ J = n δ v . This current is larger where the plasma density is enhanced than where it is reduced. On the right, we show the direction of the net, wave-driven, vertical, electron current, δ J e . An identical mechanism generates wave-driven currents in the auroral electrojet when ∇ n = 0, E 0 is horizontal, and B 0 is vertical (Oppenheim, 1997). The simulations also show that FB waves nonlinearly drive a large-scale (dc) current in the E-region ionosphere, as shown in Fig. 4.39 (Oppenheim, 1997). This current flows parallel to the fundamental Pedersen current and with a comparable magnitude. These currents can restructure the electrojet as shown in Fig. 4.40. Also, by effectively increasing the Pedersen currents, wave-driven currents reduce the electrojet charge and polarization field, E 0 , responsible for driving FB waves. This makes the linear phase velocity drop toward the acoustic speed and may play an important role in sound speed saturation of type 1 waves. A wave-driven current results from two fundamental features of E-region plasma waves. First, electrons travel mostly perpendicular to the electric fields due to the geomagnetic field while ions travel mostly parallel to the fields because ion-neutral collisions make magnetic field effects inconsequential. Sec- ond, gradient-drift and two-stream instabilities cause compressional waves where the plasma density enhancements and the perturbed electric fields remain largely in phase. At the plasma density maxima of the propagating wave fronts, electrons move perpendicular to the wave direction and the geomagnetic field. At the density minima, electrons move in the opposite direction with an equal velocity. However, more electrons exist at the maxima than at the minima caus- ing a greater current in one direction than the other, resulting in a net (direct) current."},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"210 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics El e ctroj e t curr e nt 80 100 120 140 H ei ght (km) 0 5 10 15 20 W e stward curr e nt (uA/m 2 ) L e g e nd W i th NL e ff e cts W i thout NL e ff e cts Wav e thr e shold W i th GD NL e ff e cts Figure 4.40 Electrojet current density as a function of height.

Note the similarity to Fig. 4.29. [After Oppenheim (1997). Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] The electric fields measured by rockets passing through gradient-drift waves appear as irregular square waves (see Fig. 4.29). Wave-driven electron currents can cause these squared-off electric fields through a two-step process. First, the perturbed electric field of a gradient-drift wave must exceed the threshold necessary to initiate two-stream waves (Sudan et al., 1973). Second, these sec- ondary two-stream waves generate wave-driven electron currents that modify the original gradient-drift waves. This effect has been estimated numerically in Oppenheim (1997) and is shown in Fig. 4.41."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Equatorial Plasma Instabilities and Mesospheric Turbulence 211 4.9 D-Region Turbulence Some of the first observations of mesospheric turbulence were made at the Jicamarca Observatory, and we choose to discuss this phenomenon first in this chapter, even though it is a worldwide process. On average, the atmosphere is well mixed below about 100 km, called the turbopause. Above this height the various molecules can separate according to their mass. A detailed study of tur- bulence per se is beyond the scope here but it does affect the small-scale structure of the D region. Since the atmosphere in the mesosphere is very dense compared to the ionized component, the ions and electrons are pushed around at will by the neutral gas. The charged particles thus act as passive scalars in the vernacular of turbulence theory. As the ionized components are pushed around by turbulent motions, if a gradient exists in their content, as there almost always is, advection will create structure in the ions and electrons. The resulting irregularities have been studied using radars and rockets. In Fig. 3.35 a typical passive scalar spectrum was shown (Tennekes and Lumley, 1972). In turbulence theory, energy is conjectured to be injected into a fluid at some scale L i . In a laboratory experiment this might be the spacing of grids placed in the flow. In the atmosphere the injection scale might be related to gravity waves (buoyancy scale) or a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). At smaller scales, energy is passed from large eddies to smaller eddies without any energy loss until a small enough scale is reached that viscosity becomes impor- tant. These two ranges are called the inertial and viscous subranges, respectively. Viscosity is important at small scales since the term ∇ 2 u ≈ (η/ρ) k 2 u is large when k 2 is large. The breakpoint to a very steep spectrum occurs near the Kolmogorov microscale given by μ = ( ν 3 ε ) 1 / 4 where ν is the molecular kinematic viscosity coefficient ( η/ρ ) and ε is the energy dissipation rate (Watts/kg). This expression shows that, as ν increases with increasing altitude, μ increases. There is also a weak tendency for μ to decrease with increasing ε , but the fourth-power dependence makes this a less important effect. Since energy is dissipated by viscosity, the dissipation rate ( ε ) is propor- tional to the turbulent energy cascading down the spectrum. A plot of various scales for the earth’s atmosphere was presented earlier in Fig. 3.36. In Fig. 3.36, the inner (viscous) scale was calculated following Tatarskii (1971) as l i ≈ 7 . 4 μ"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"212 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Here, l i is the wave number associated with the spectral break ( 2 π/ l i ) to the viscous subrange. At mesospheric heights Hocking finds that l i ≈ 20–40 m. This explains why typical radars do not receive echoes from mesospheric altitudes, even though during daytime the region has numerous electrons. The Bragg scat- tering wavelength at 50 MHz is 3 m and is well into the viscous subrange where turbulent fluctuations are very small. Only the very large Jicamarca radar and the large MU radar receive echoes under such conditions. A very nice verification of these ideas came during one of the rocket flights from Peru in 1983. The experimenters waited until strong echoes were received at Jicamarca and then launched a high resolution electron density probe (Royrvik and Smith, 1984). The spectrum they measured at 85 . 5 ± 0 . 2 km is plotted in the right-hand panel of Fig. 4.42 and shows a very steep spectrum for λ ≤ 25 m. The power spectral density at k = 2m − 1 was small but was in quantitative agreement with the Jicamarca radar signal strength. The high latitude winter spectrum (central panel) is very similar to the equatorial spectrum. However, the high latitude summer results are very different and are discussed in some detail in Chapter 7 where the importance of charged ice is detailed. A number of factors lead to atmospheric turbulence. The two most common energy release mechanisms are convective and dynamic instabilities.

The mesospheric echoes received at Jicamarca are thought to be related to the dynamic instability of a sheared wind field. 4.10 Future Directions The physics of equatorial plasma instabilities involves a complex interplay between aeronomic, electrodynamic, and plasma physical processes. At the present juncture we have a good understanding of the sources of free energy that lead to the generation of nonthermal fluctuations in the equatorial plasma. The present research thrusts involve (a) understanding the seasonal, local time, and solar cycle control of the onset of instabilities; (b) understanding the nonlin- ear evolution of the plasma processes themselves; and (c) predicting convective ionospheric storms. In these areas, numerical modeling and data assimilation are becoming very common research tools. Such models allow the researcher to vary different physical parameters and see the effect of the variation. In a geophysical context, such control is not available to the experimenter, so the modeling effort is very important. Major future strides in the space research area will continue to come from direct comparison between experimental results and numerical simulations. Neutral atmospheric effects are becoming more impor- tant to aeronomic studies as we begin to study the D-region dynamics more closely. References Albert, J. M., and Sudan, R. N. (1991).

Our goal here is to treat what we feel are the most interesting hydrodynamical and electrodynamical processes that arise in midlatitude ionospheric physics. In both a geographic and dynamical sense, the midlatitude zone is a buffer between the low-latitude pro- cesses discussed in Chapters 3 and 4 and the high-latitude phenomena presented in later chapters. Both electric fields and perturbed neutral winds penetrate from high- latitude sources, while equatorial plasma streams into the region along the magnetic field lines. Atmospheric tides are quite important, since they grow in intensity with altitude, as do the gravity waves that continually roll in from high latitudes and/or up from stratospheric and tropospheric sources. These are just a few of the dynam- ical interactions that continue to make the study of midlatitude ionospheric physics challenging and interesting. We explore the dynamics and electrodynamics of the midlatitude ionosphere here and its plasma physics in Chapter 6. 5.1 Introduction to the Tropical and Midlatitude Ionospheres 5.1.1 Background Material In this context we might define the tropical zone as that region where the mag- netic field has a significant dip angle yet cannot be considered to be nearly vertical, as is the case in the auroral zone and polar cap. The latitudes of the Arecibo and, now closed, the St. Santin Radar Observatories are ideally suited for study of this zone (see Appendix A for position data on several sites dis- cussed in the text). The dip angle at Arecibo, for example, is 46 . 7 ◦ , which allows approximate geometric equality between forces parallel and perpendicular to B . Important information also comes from the Millstone Hill Observatory, which is equatorward of St. Santin in geographic coordinates but poleward of St. Santin geomagnetically.

We term this region midlatitude as opposed to tropical. Until recently most of our electrodynamical information has come from vector F-region plasma drift measurements made with the incoherent scatter method at these sites. As discussed in Chapter 3, drifts measured perpendicular to B in the F region can be interpreted unambiguously and yield the ambient electric field via the rela- tionship E =− V × B . The parallel drift component is much more complex, however, since gravity, neutral winds, and pressure gradients all contribute. The availability of neutral wind measurements using optical techniques at Arecibo, Fritz Peak, and other midlatitude sites has greatly helped interpretation of the incoherent scatter parallel drift data. Satellite data on neutral and plasma densi- ties and temperatures have been very useful but the dynamics of the midlatitude region are difficult to study at orbital speeds. The roles of the forces that act on the ionospheric plasma in the direction parallel to B is clear from (2.36a), which we reproduce here: V \u0003 j || = [ b j E \u0003 − D j ∇ n / n + ( D j / H j ) ˆ g ] · ˆ B (5.1) The primes indicate that the quantities are measured in the frame of reference in which the neutral wind velocity vanishes. Transforming to the earth-fixed frame where the neutral wind has a value U , the parallel component of the velocity V j is given by V j || = U · ˆ B + V \u0003 j || (5.2) The plasma is thus closely coupled to the neutral gas motion along B , but its velocity is modified by the term V \u0003 j || . For simplicity, in (5.1) we have continued to ignore temperature gradients, which must be included in a complete treatment of the total pressure gradient. For now, we ignore the neutral wind and external electric fields. During the day, plasma production or loss by photoionization and recombi- nation dominates the plasma profiles in the E and lower F regions, creating the horizontally stratified, slowly varying plasma content of the ionosphere. Rishbeth and Garriott (1969) and Schunk and Nagy (2000) describe the relevant physics and chemistry in great detail, and we refer the reader to their discussion. The ionization profile increases sharply in the 90–100 km range and then more slowly up to a peak, which is typically near 300 km. Above the F peak we expect the plasma to be in a state something akin to diffusive equilibrium in the gravitational field. Because of its light mass, the electron gas diffuses much faster than the ions down a pressure gradient, a process that would tend rapidly to destroy any gradient in electron pressure. However, the resultant charge separation is accompanied by an electric field that restrains the electrons and enhances the ion diffusion. Quantitatively, we can argue as follows. In diffusive equilibrium there should be no net flow of the electron gas"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"Hydro- and Electrodynamics of the Midlatitude Ionosphere 223 or of the ion gas. Our calculations are in the neutral gas frame (or, equivalently, we can assume U = 0), and we take the applied perpendicular electric field to be zero for now. Parallel to B the velocity for each species is given by (5.1). Taking T i = T e = T for algebraic ease, n i = n e = n , and setting both velocities equal to zero gives for the Northern Hemisphere b e [ E || + k B T ne ∇ || n − mg || e ] = 0 (5.3a) b i [ E || − k B T ne ∇ || n + Mg || e ] = 0 (5.3b) Remember that the mobility parameter b j carries the sign of the charge and that e is a positive number. Dividing each equation by the appropriate mobility, taking m \u0005 M , and adding yields E || = ( − M / 2 e ) g || Likewise, setting the perpendicular components of velocity equal to zero in (2.36b) and using the large- κ case, which is suitable for the upper F region (recall that κ j = \u0003 j /ν j ), we have 0 = b e κ e [ E + k B T ne ∇ n − m g e ] × ˆ B (5.4a) 0 = b i κ i [ E + k B T ne ∇ n + M g e ] × ˆ B (5.4b) We can solve these two equations for the perpendicular electric field to find E ⊥ =− M g ⊥ / 2 e , and thus combining both components, E =− ( M / 2 e ) g Finally, substituting this result into (5.4b) yields ∇ n / n = ( M / 2 k B T ) g This shows that the equilibrium density gradient is vertically downward, even though the magnetic field is inclined at an arbitrary angle. This particular case is an example of a general theorem from statistical mechanics which states that in thermal equilibrium a magnetic field cannot affect the distribution of any fluid, ionized or not. The plasma scale height is equal to 2 k B T / Mg or more generally k B ( T i + T e )/ Mg if T e \u0007= T i . The plasma acts like a neutral gas in a gravitational field with mean mass equal to the average of m and M . The electric field is M g / 2 e , and thus has the value 0 . 8 μ V / minanO + plasma.

The force on the ions associated with this electric field, plus that of gravity, is countered by the plasma pressure gradient. Perpendicular to B , this electric field is trivial. Since the assumed dynamic equilibrium is between electrons and the dominant ion species, light minor ions such as He + and H + can be accelerated outward from the ionosphere by the parallel electric field. A considerable literature has developed concerning the effect of this E || on minor light ions and a complete theory of the topside ionosphere requires its consideration. We take up this topic in some detail in the polar case treated in Chapter 9, but for midlatitudes the reader is referred to Schunk and Nagy (2000). Since hydrogen atoms and molecules can escape the earth’s gravitational field, the earth is surrounded with a hydrogen gas “geocorona,” which interacts with oxygen ions via the charge exchange reaction O + + H → ← H + + O which is a very rapid process. The result is that a transition occurs between an oxygen and a hydrogen plasma between 500 and 1000 km, depending on seasonal and other effects (Vickrey et al., 1979; Gonzalez, 1994). Since light ions such as hydrogen can escape gravity, our simple assumption of diffusive equilibrium breaks down and a net upward flux of plasma is possible during the day at the “top” of the ionosphere. The closed dipole magnetic flux tubes at tropical and midlatitudes act as a reservoir for plasma, called the plasmasphere, which is created during the day by photoionization and carried upward by light ions. At night the plasma can flow back down, tending to maintain the density in the ionosphere. The result is a complex interaction between the ionosphere and a region of hydrogen plasma trapped by the dipole magnetic field. To summarize, without winds and electric fields, photoionization coupled with diffusion, recombination, and charge exchange with the geocorona would com- pletely determine the properties of the ionosphere. Rishbeth and Garriott (1969) discussthissituationingreatdetail,derivingtheso-calledChapmanlayerformfor the ionosphere and discussing the various ionospheric layers, E , F 1 , F, and so on. A diurnal variation in peak plasma density would be expected, and some balance would arise between the low-altitude production and outflow of plasma along magnetic field lines during the day and low-altitude recombination and inflow of plasma at night. We explore simple models for these conditions following. The situation is much more complicated than this, however, since neutral winds and electric fields also move the plasma. These forces greatly affect the altitude of ionospheric plasma, particularly in the F region. Since the density of molecular ions determines the speed with which O + recombination occurs and since these densities are exponentially dependent on altitude, dynamic processes also affect the plasma content.

The first four days were very quiet geomagnetically, but the next six days were very active. Also plotted is the maximum value of the plasma fre- quency in the F region of the ionosphere ( f 0 F2 ) relative to its hourly average. The electron density n is related to the plasma frequency f p by n =[ f p / 8900 ] 2 (see Appendix B). In the plot, both parameters vary drastically after April 21 in a manner called an ionospheric storm. The general trend is for a decrease in plasma density, an effect referred to as a negative ionospheric storm. A nega- tive storm is thought to be due to a composition change and, more specifically, to a decrease in the ratio [O]/[N 2 ], which affects both the production and the recombination rates of the plasma. But superimposed on the density decrease are variations of f 0 F2, which correlate with the height variations—that is, a high ionosphere corresponds to high electron density. This correlation is due in part to reduced recombination at high altitudes but is complicated by an exchange of plasma with the plasmasphere. The plasma content also affects the electrical conductivity of the ionosphere (and thus the electric field) as well as ion drag (and thus the neutral wind). Throwing in the conjugate hemisphere, which in general will have a different neutral wind and conductivity (but presumably the same electric field), one has a very complex coupled electrodynamic/dynamic system (without even mention- ing external influences such as high-latitude electric fields and aurorally driven winds!).

In a steady state, n ( O + ) = q ( O + ) β (5.8) However, (5.8) cannot be correct as is for the F2 layer since, as β goes to zero with altitude, the electron density would go to infinity. Balance is restored by diffusion, which rapidly increases with altitude. As a rule of thumb, diffusion dominates above the altitude where the chemical lifetime equals the diffusive time scale. The chemical time scale is τ ch = β − 1 (5.9) and the time needed to diffuse one scale height is τ D = H 2 / D a (5.10) where D a is the ambipolar diffusion coefficient. The F2 peak thus occurs where these two time scales are equal: τ ch = τ D (5.11) For the earth’s atmosphere, balance occurs around 300 km. Above this height, ignoring plasma storage and release from high altitudes, diffusive equilibrium occurs (see Section 5.1.1). 5.1.3 Equations Including Vertical Flux Without Winds or Electric Fields It is instructive first to consider a vertical magnetic field since the equations are less complex.

We have ∂ n ∂ t =− β n + D a D n (5.17a) Unfortunately, the β term does not have the same altitude dependence as the other terms, since recombination depends upon the molecular neutral density whereas D a is determined by the atomic oxygen ion mass.

However, if we take β( z \u0003 ) = β 0 e − z \u0003 we can find an exact solution that is very interesting (Martyn, 1956).

Note the similarity to (5.10). The profile form, because of the factor of 2, is called an α -Chapman layer, even though the recombination is due to the parameter β . Diffusion and recombination thus balance in such a way that the shape of n ( z \u0003 ) is constant while the decay of the whole layer is determined by β 0 , the recombination rate at the F peak. Figure 5.3b shows typical layers measured over Arecibo at night, along with a fit to an α -Chapman layer, which gives credence to this simple model. It can be shown that for this solution W D is a constant with altitude and is equal to g /ν in evaluated at the F peak. This remarkable result can be explained as follows. At high altitudes the plasma falls through the F peak and recom- bines below it. This is clearly a nonequilibrium case because the plasma density decreases with time, but the layer shape is independent of time. Without any other forces acting, except for gravity and pressure, the layer would stay at the same height but steadily decrease in density. This is not quite what happens in the real ionosphere, though, since neutral winds and electric fields exist and control the height of the F layer at night.

As discussed in Chapter 3, the zonal electric field at the magnetic equator is eastward during the day, which creates a steady upward E × B / B 2 plasma drift. Just after sunset this eastward electric field is enhanced and the F-region plasma can drift to very high attitudes where recombination is slow, while the low-altitude plasma decays quickly once the sun sets. The result is called the fountain effect, since the dense equatorial plasma rises until the pres- sure forces are high enough in (5.1) that it starts to slide down the magnetic field lines, assisted by gravity, toward the tropical ionosphere. This “sliding” results in a region of enhanced plasma density referred to as the equatorial or Appleton Anomaly. The various forces acting on the plasma are illustrated schematically in Fig. 5.4a. If the zonal electric field is taken as a given quantity based, for example, on the experimental data shown in Chapter 3, then the actions of production and recombination can be combined with the vertical E × B motion of the ionosphere (a) Equator 20° N 20° S E B E 3 B Local time 24 18 12 6 0 2 40 0 40 S Dip angle N 5 Local time 24 18 12 6 0 0 S Dip angle 40 2 40 N 5 (b) FOF2 FOF2 = p , g = p , g Figure 5.4 (a) Schematic diagram of how plasma uplift via electric fields transports plasma from equatorial to tropical zones.

The effect has been illustrated in model calculations by D. Andersen. In the upper-contour plot of Fig. 5.4b, the zonal electric field was taken to be zero, while in the lower plot it had the typical variation with local time measured at Jicamarca. A considerable difference in the tropical ionospheric density is predicted in the two different electrodynamic states. In the latter case the zonal electric field drove the plasma to heights where recombination was small. The plasma thus survived longer and had time to flow down the magnetic field lines to higher-latitude regions, forming two symmetrical enhancements on each side of the equator through the combined action of electrodynamic uplift, pressure gradients, and gravity. In either model, a low-density trough occurs just before sunrise. The calculation, which includes a zonal electric field, fits observations of the equatorial anomaly quite well. A visual indication of the equatorial anomaly obtained from an image taken from the Dynamics Explorer-1 satellite located nearly 8000 km above the earth is reproduced here in Fig. 5.5. The image corresponds to an emission line that is produced by O + ions when they recombine with electrons. In the photograph, the dayside of the earth is very bright, and a ringlike halo surrounds the polar regions. The latter is the auroral oval. Of interest here are the parallel bands Figure 5.5 Two photographs of the earth’s disk with images due primarily to neutral oxygen emissions made from the imager on the Dynamics Explorer-1 satellite.

In recent years, this emission line has been detected by instruments on the IMAGE and TIMED satellites. 5.1.7 The Corotation Electric Field and Formation of the Plasmasphere An important dynamical effect involves the nontrivial fact that the plasma on low-latitude flux tubes to first order corotates with the earth. That this must occur can be proved as follows. If the ionospheric plasma did not corotate, in the nonrotating plasma frame there would be a very large neutral wind U R and a current J = σ · ( U R × B ) . Since σ depends on altitude, this current is not divergence-free, and an electric field will build up in the E region of the nonrotating frame until J = σ · ( E R + U R × B ) = 0. The current vanishes when the plasma E × B drifts at exactly the same velocity as the earth rotates. Transforming back to the rotating frame, we find E = 0. Now it is a remarkable fact that the electric field in the nonrotating frame is transmitted along the magnetic field and causes the entire inner magnetosphere to corotate with the earth, even though there is virtually no neutral gas at high altitudes on those flux tubes. Turning this argument around, it is exactly on those flux tubes that corotate with the earth that cold ionospheric plasma can build up to the extent that is observed in the dense plasma-filled region termed the plasmasphere. A crude estimate of the latitude below which corotation dominates can be formed by equating the corotation electric field to the electric field of magnetospheric and solar wind origin. The comparison is properly done in the nonrotating frame. At latitudes where the former dominates, flux tubes and the plasma attached to them make a complete circuit of the earth in one day, allowing the trapping and buildup of a cold hydrogen plasma of ionospheric origin (taking into account the charge exchange process that converts O + into H + , of course). At higher latitudes the flux tubes follow trajectories in which they are at times connected to the solar wind or extend to very great distances down the magnetic tail. In either case, the flux tube volume is so large that plasma almost continuously flows outward, never building up a high density such as occurs in the plasmasphere. Quantitatively, we can proceed as follows. The corotational electric field at ionospheric heights is in the meridional direction and is given by Mozer (1973) as E c = 14 cos θ ( 1 + 3 sin 2 θ ) 1 / 2 mV / m (5.18) where θ is the latitude and a centered dipole field has been assumed. The coef- ficient 14 in this expression is determined by the rotation speed of the earth, its radius, and the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment. For a planet such as Jupiter, these parameters are all larger and the latitude region of corotation dominance is quite a bit higher than for the earth. Notice that for θ = 0 and"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"Hydro- and Electrodynamics of the Midlatitude Ionosphere 235 B eq = 3 . 1 × 10 − 5 T, E c / B eq equals the zonal rotation speed of the earth at the equator. To relate this field to the magnitude of the magnetospheric electric field, we treat the magnetic field lines as equipotentials. Following the discussion in Mozer (1970; see also Chapter 2), the meridional electric field component maps from the ionosphere (I) to the magnetosphere (M) (and vice versa) as E I / E M = 2 L ( L − 3 4 ) 1 / 2 (5.19) where L is the equatorial crossing distance of a dipole field line measured in earth radii. In Fig. 5.6 the corotation field from (5.18) is plotted, along with dashed lines giving the ionospheric electric field associated with two different magni- tude magnetospheric source fields of 1 and 0.4 mV/m, mapped to the ionosphere using (5.19). In comparing the magnitudes and effects of these two electric field sources (rotation versus solar wind), it is important to note that the relevant reference frame is the one fixed with respect to the sun. In that frame the solar wind blows by and interacts with the magnetosphere, creating the electric field of magnetospheric origin discussed above. The earth rotates in that reference frame, generating the corotation electric field we refer to. The plasma at the equatorial plane E × B then drifts at the whim of whichever source of electric field dominates. 0 0.1 Typical ionospheric fields (mV/m) 1.0 10 30 1 1.5 L –Value 1 mV/m Corotation Magnetospheric origin Ionospheric dynamo 0.4 mV/m 24816 Latitude (degrees) 60 90 100 Figure 5.6 Typical ionospheric level electric fields observed in a nonrotating frame of reference that arise from corotation, the interaction of tidal neutral winds with the iono- sphere, and the interaction of the solar wind with the terrestrial magnetic field.

The value corresponding to the higher magneto- spheric field matches the corotation field at about L = 3. For this range of magnetospheric sources and the properties of the earth’s dipole field and rota- tion rate, we see that planetary rotation dominates the physics at the equator within, say, 3–7 earth radii. The “extraterrestrial” source dominates at higher L values. The region referred to as the plasmasphere corresponds to latitudes where the flux tubes corotate, since such tubes can fill with plasma on the dayside. Sunlight copiously creates an F-region atomic oxygen plasma, which in turn flows out along the field lines, exchanging charge with neutral hydrogen atoms. At night there is not sufficient time to deplete these flux tubes, and, on average, a dense, cold hydrogen ion plasma fills the upper plasmasphere. The average profile of plasma density in the magnetospheric equatorial plane reproduced in Fig. 5.7 shows how drastic the decrease in electron density can be near what is called the plasmapause (at L = 4 in this case). Since the magnetospheric electric field is quite variable, Fig. 5.6 shows that the position of the plasmapause and thus the plas- masphere’s effect on the midlatitude ionosphere as a plasma reservoir are strong functions of the applied magnetospheric electric field (see Chapter 8). Magnetic activity and solar wind conditions thus affect the midlatitude ionosphere through electron dynamics as well as chemistry (because of neutral composition changes) and, as we shall see, thermospheric winds driven by high latitude heating and momentum transfer. 2 3 Height (in earth radii) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 5 6 7 8 4 n e (eq) (cm 2 3 ) Figure 5.7 Average equatorial profile of electron density.

In some sense this corresponds to the “electrodynamic weather” just as neutral atmospheric weather-related winds are measured in the rotating frame. 5.2.1 Electric Field Measurements The lowest line in Fig. 5.6 is a plot of the average value of the Sq (solar quiet) dynamo electric field as a function of latitude. This electric field source has been discussed briefly in Chapter 3 and originates from the divergence in the electric currents driven by tidal motions of the neutral atmosphere in the highly con- ducting E layer (Matsushita, 1967, 1971). The solar heating source dominates the tides, although lunar gravitational effects are also important. Chapman and Lindzen (1970) have discussed tidal theory in great detail, and several applica- tions of this theory involving electrodynamic calculations have been made (e.g., Matsushita, 1967; Richmond et al., 1976). The mathematics in these models is complicated but the physics is relatively straightforward, and we will not discuss these models extensively here. To first order they yield reasonable agree- ment with quiet-time ionospheric electric fields, particularly in the daytime low- latitude ionosphere. The results are not at all good at night and also deteriorate with increasing latitude. (A comparison of tidal theory with Jicamarca measure- ments, which show some of these features, was given in Chapter 3.) In this text we emphasize the processes that are less well understood and thus concentrate on the nighttime period at low (but not equatorial) latitudes and the influence of auroral zone effects at the interface between the high-latitude and midlatitude zones. To organize our study, we use incoherent scatter data from the Northern Hemisphere sites Arecibo (18 . 5 ◦ ;31 ◦ ), St. Santin (44 . 1 ◦ ;40 ◦ ), and Millstone Hill (42 . 6 ◦ ;57 ◦ ). The first number in the parentheses is the geographic latitude and the second the geomagnetic latitude. Other relevant details concerning these sites are included in Appendix A. In the discussion we distinguish between the tropical and the midlatitude ionosphere. The former is characterized by an intermediate dip angle and a sufficient enough distance from the auroral zone that most of the time the ionosphere is unaffected by high-latitude electrodynamics. The Arecibo data set is clearly tropical (31 ◦ geomagnetic latitude; 48 ◦ dip angle). St. Santin and Millstone Hill have similar midlatitude geographic positions, but the latter is much farther north geomagnetically (57 ◦ versus 40 ◦ ). These two sites will thus be the prototypes for our study of the differences between tropical and midlatitudes and will be closely investigated for evidence of auroral effects. Our starting point is the empirical study by Richmond et al. (1980), some results of which are presented here in Fig. 5.8a–d.

Considering first the zonal electric field component on the left side of each plot, there are remarkable similarities among all four sites during the period 0300–1400 and among the nonequatorial sites at all times. The latter three data sets seem to exhibit a particularly strong semidiurnal behavior. The Jicamarca zonal component seems to be primarily diurnal. This result is quite reasonable, since it is fairly well established that the semidiurnal atmospheric tide is not very important at equatorial latitudes but that it dominates in the geographic"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"Hydro- and Electrodynamics of the Midlatitude Ionosphere 241 midlatitude region (Chapman and Lindzen, 1970). Thus, as just noted, these results are reasonably consistent with a tidal E-region source, in particular for the daytime zonal electric field component. (The equatorial prereversal enhancement does not show up very well in this early presentation.) The meridional electric field component in the right-hand panels is generally larger and is dominated by a diurnal variation at all four sites. It seems curious that one component exhibits a semidiurnal modulation and the other a diurnal one! It may be that the two dynamos (E and F regions) conspire to yield a diurnal pattern for the meridional electric field (zonal drift) at all these latitudes. There is an important difference to note between data from the three lowest latitude sites (Jicamarca, Arecibo, and St. Santin) and the Millstone Hill data. In the 1600– 2400 local time period even the algebraic sign of the Millstone Hill meridional component is different from the other three sites. That is, Millstone registers a poleward field, while all three other facilities register an equatorward field (“downward” at Jicamarca). We return to this point later when auroral zone effects are discussed. The electric field vectors in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic fields deduced from barium cloud drift data shown in Fig. 5.9 bear out these last comments as well. Notice that in the evening twilight periods the releases all show equatorward electric fields and that the releases were all at latitudes less than 35 ◦ geomagnetically. These data agree with St. Santin and Arecibo quite nicely but disagree with Millstone Hill. Mozer (1973) and Gonzales et al.

Early observations were compiled by Burnside et al. (1980) for Arecibo. The most important feature for the nighttime ionosphere is that prior to midnight, the meridional wind is usually southward. Because of the finite dip angle, this means that the plasma is held up against grav- ity until about midnight. After this the “midnight collapse” occurs, the F layer falls, recombines, and sometimes nearly disappears (Nelson and Cogger, 1971). In 1973, Perkins created a remarkably robust concept: the field line–integrated ionosphere. The huge advantage of this idea is that pressure gradients disappear from the equations. The entire ionosphere is a gigantic particle affected by winds, gravitational forces, and electric fields. Figure 5.10 shows how the equator- ward wind (southward in the Northern Hemisphere) supports this “particle” against gravity. In the Northern Hemisphere, the steady state, the plasma veloc- ity antiparallel to the magnetic field due to the action of a southward wind and gravity is W || = u s cos I − ( g /ν in ) sin I where I is the inclination angle, which is equal to the dip angle. If the first term dominates, the ionosphere will rise. But since ν in exponentially decreases with height, eventually the second term will cancel the first and the parallel velocity will vanish. In general, we are most interested in the vertical component of ionospheric motion. Projecting the parallel velocity to vertical, an equilibrium holds when W || = 0—that is, when ( g /ν in ) sin 2 I = u s cos I sin I (5.20) This equality holds if and only if ν in = ( g / u s ) tan I (5.21a) This equation represents a subset of Perkins’ (1973) solutions for the height of the ionosphere based on wind and gravitational forces but ignoring any electric Magnetic field line Ionospheric laye r Wind B Figure 5.10 A ping-pong ball model for the midlatitude ionosphere.

But if the wind or electric field (see following) changes, the height of the F peak will vary to satisfy (5.21a) with ν in replaced by \u000f ν in \u0010 . In an exponential neutral atmosphere, the value of \u000f ν in \u0010 is a monotonically decreasing function of altitude and thus (5.21b) can be mapped into altitude. Remarkably, for a Chapman layer \u000f ν in \u0010 is exactly equal to the value of ν in at the peak of the Chapman profile. Data illustrating these concepts are presented in Fig. 5.11, in which two and one-half days of electron density data are present. A modest magnetic storm was under way, and on the night of September 15–16, a negative ionospheric storm occurred with lower nighttime electron densities than usual. Such storms are thought to be due to enhanced recombination that, in turn, is due to neutral composition changes. Figure 3.30a shows how a pulse of wind from the north brings temperature changes with it. This causes the [O]/[N 2 ] ratio to decrease, changing both the production and loss.

On the next night, even though the layer fell, the density remained high, even at 260 km, where recombination is very fast. On this night it seems that flux from the plasmasphere maintained the high F-region density and furthermore that electric field effects were important (Vlasov et al., 2003). We take up such effects next. 5.2.3 Combined Effects of Electric Fields and Neutral Winds More generally, to find the equilibrium height at which the vertical velocity vanishes, we have ( g / \u000f ν in \u0010 ) sin 2 I = ( E e / B ) cos I + u s cos I sin I where E e is the eastward component in the electric field. Solving for \u000f ν in \u0010 yields \u000f ν in \u0010 = ( g E e / B + u s cos I ) sin I (5.22) The wind and electric field can be lumped into an effective southward wind, u s eff = ( E e / B )( cos I ) − 1 + u s . Then the height can be found from (5.21b) since \u000f ν in \u0010 is a unique marker for altitude. Turning this around, if we know the height of the layer we can deduce the effective wind. Ionosondes can be used for this application. Equation (5.22) is the Perkins equilibrium condition. We investigate its stability or lack thereof in the next chapter. Note that (5.22) pre- dicts the eventual (equilibrium) height of a layer, not its instantaneous value. A more general set of equations that allows for time–dependent calculations is as follows: V z (τ) =− ( g / \u000f ν in \u0010 (τ)) sin 2 I + u s (τ) cos I sin I + ( E e (τ)/ B ) cos I (5.23a) h ( t ) = t ∫ 0 V z (τ) d τ + h ( 0 ) (5.23b) These dynamic equations can account for the motion of the layer on September 16–17 but what about the high plasma density? Why doesn’t recombination destroy the layer below 300 km? As noted previously, the explanation (Vlasov et al., 2003) seems to be that a high influx of plasmaspheric ions (5 × 10 8 cm − 2 s − 1 ) flooded the tropical ionosphere during this relatively small magnetic storm. Most likely, this is related to the large eastward electric field measured at Jicamarca the previous day and well into the evening (Makela et al., 2003), and a well-established fountain effect occurred. Indeed, a large southward gradient in plasma density was observed over Arecibo, indicating that it was located on the poleward edge of the anomaly, which is usually over a thousand kilometers"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"Hydro- and Electrodynamics of the Midlatitude Ionosphere 245 south of the observatory. Note that a poleward displacement of the anomaly accompanies an enhanced fountain effect. 5.2.4 Complexities of the Real Nighttime Tropical Ionosphere The detailed dynamics of the earth’s ionosphere is governed by a complex inter- play between motions of the neutral atmosphere, gravity, electromagnetic forces, pressure gradients, and plasma production and loss. In the nocturnal low- to mid- latitude F layer, the latter two processes are relatively unimportant and can be ignored for our purposes once the molecular ions, which have a high recombina- tion coefficient compared to O + , are removed from the system. Since molecular ions are found at low altitudes, the highly conducting daytime E region virtually disappears, which allows the F-layer plasma greater control of the electrody- namics of the region. This can be seen in Fig. 5.12, where the ratios of F region to E-region height-integrated nighttime conductivities over Arecibo are plotted for several months (Burnside, 1984). Each plot corresponds to an average of 5 days. The ratio \r PF /\r PE considerably exceeds unity for all but a few data points. The 1981–1982 data (near solar maximum) show evening values as high as 20, whereas in the 1983 data, the largest values approach 10. Earlier, Harper and Walker (1977) found the ratio to be closer to unity at solar minimum. This result most likely reflects the lower F-layer plasma densities that occur at solar minimum. The Arecibo Observatory is particularly well suited to the study of interre- lationships between these forces, and much of our knowledge concerning the tropical off-equatorial ionosphere comes from Arecibo data. The near-45 ◦ dip angle allows each of the important forces an “equal vote” in the control of the F-region plasma dynamics. This is not entirely a geometric effect but stems also from the near equality of the following four characteristic “velocities” at altitudes near the F-layer peak: E / B ; U ; g /ν in ; lV th i / L (5.24) where V th i is the ion thermal speed, l is the ion mean free path, and L is the plasma pressure gradient scale length. The last term is a measure of the term ∇ p i /ρ i ν in in the ion equation of motion, and is the velocity at which a pressure gradient would drive the ion flow velocity against friction with the neutral gas (ignoring ambipolar effects). Representative values and their sum are plotted in Fig. 5.13 for a particular (observed) electron density profile over Arecibo. If any of these terms dominated the dynamics, the F-layer as we know it could not be limited to the relatively modest attitude excursions found experimentally. Turning this argument around, we have argued above that the F layer seeks out an attitude where a balance between these factors is reached. But does this balance occur? Numerous measurements of vector plasma velocities have been conducted at Arecibo.

At least three expla- nations have been put forward to explain this observation: ion drag (Dougherty, 1961), the F-region dynamo (Rishbeth, 1971), and parallel ion diffusion (Stubbe and Chandra, 1970). In the first of these theories, the atmosphere is assumed initially to be at rest and an external zonal electric field is applied which puts the plasma in motion via the E × B drift. (The reader is warned that this mechanism is not thought to be important at tropical or midlatitude regions but does work at high altitudes, as seen in Chapter 9.) For example, a zonally eastward electric field would cause the plasma to move northward and upward at a near 45 ◦ angle over Arecibo with velocity − ( E e / B ) ˆ a y \u0003 , where ˆ a y \u0003 is a unit vector perpendicular to B in the magnetic meridian (see Fig. 5.15). We ignore the declination of the magnetic field. The moving ions would, after a while, set the neutral gas in motion via the ion drag effect. Scaling arguments (Holton, 1979) show that the neutrals cannot have a very large vertical velocity so they would eventually attain a poleward horizontal velocity U = v ˆ a y due to momentum transfer from the ions. Once this horizontal flow begins, it entrains the plasma flow with its component downward, parallel to B , which would oppose the upward velocity component. We estimate the acceleration time below. Note that we are using the standard meteorological notation with components ( u , v , w ) positive in the directions east, north, and up, and use primes for the geomagnetic coordinate system. The plasma carries a zonal current, J ⊥ = σ P E ⊥ , where we can use a scalar Pedersen conductivity, since we are considering perpendicular motion in the F region where σ is diagonal. The J × B force due to this zonal current is, in fact, the origin of the poleward ion drag force on the neutrals. Once the neutrals begin to move with some velocity U the current is given by J = σ P ( E + U × B ) .

In this state, projection of the plasma and neutral flow perpendicular to B must be equal and, when added to the parallel motion, the two fluids move horizontally together. This is illustrated in Fig. 5.15a and can be seen mathematically as follows. Once the neutrals begin to move with velocity U , they produce field-aligned motion of the ions such that V i || = U || . The final vector plasma velocity in geomagnetic (primed) coordinates is given by V i =− ( E e / B ) ˆ a y \u0003 + ν cos I ˆ a z \u0003 (5.25) where ˆ a z \u0003 is a unit vector parallel to B . In the final state the neutrals will be driven geographically northward with the velocity ν = E ( B sin I ) − 1 . Finally, substituting this result into (5.2) yields the plasma geographic velocity V y = E ( B sin I ) − 1 , and V z = 0. The plasma thus does not end up with a vertical velocity component at all, but moves horizontally at the same speed as the neutrals. The time constant for horizontal (meridional) acceleration of the neutrals by a zonal electric field can be estimated from the initial J × B force via ∂ν/∂ t = ( J × B ) ·ˆ a y / n n M = ( σ P EB / n n M ) sin I In the F-region, σ P = ne 2 ν in / M \u0003 2 i , which is proportional to the neutral density due to the ν in term. Thus, the n n terms cancel out, and the acceleration depends only on the plasma density. The acceleration time is thus of the order of δ t = ( 2 × 10 15 /ν ) ( δν B / E ) s and for a density of 3 × 10 11 m − 3 , a time of the order of 1 h is required to accel- erate the neutral atmosphere to a velocity ν comparable to E / B . Thus, although this mechanism does lead to a net horizontal motion for the plasma, a consider- able time is required to establish the effect. In addition to the long time constant, this explanation ignores the problem of the origin of the electric field, which pre- sumably requires an external magnetospheric source or a field applied from the other hemisphere that maps to the local ionosphere along B . This process is thus not likely to explain the common observation of horizontal ion motion. Notice that J · E ≥ 0 initially, as required when electrical energy is converted to the mechanical energy in the neutral atmospheric flow. This process can therefore be termed a “motor.” A dynamo explanation is more promising, since the process self-consistently generates an electric field and operates on a much faster time scale, which is of the order of ( \u0003 i ) − 1 . For example, if we start with zero electric field but a neutral meridional wind, ν ˆ a y , in the equatorward direction (see Fig. 5.15b), a zonally eastward current given by J = σ P U × B will flow with magnitude σ P | ν | B sin I . If boundary conditions are applied that force the net zonal current to be zero, a"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"250 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics westward electric field must build up such that E = ν B sin I ˆ a x \u0003 . The net plasma velocity will again be due to the combined effect of the electric field and the neutral velocity. In this case the total plasma velocity due to the E × B drift and the component of U parallel to B , when projected into geographic coordinates, becomes V y = ν sin 2 I + ν cos 2 I = ν and V z = ν sin I cos I − ν cos I sin I = 0. Again, the plasma does not move vertically at all and matches the horizontal neutral speed. Here, J · E ≤ 0 initially, since electrical energy is created from a mechanical source as in a dynamo. Note that ν is negative in Fig. 5.15b (south- ward winds). Finally, sedimentation can also act to create horizontal ion motion. Since the downward velocity due to gravity is proportional to ( ν in ) − 1 , which increases rapidly with height, there is a natural limitation on the altitude to which either an equatorward wind (which pushes plasma up along B ) or an east- ward electric field (which E × B drifts the plasma upward and northward) can drive the plasma. Eventually the material falls along B as fast as it is pushed up and no net vertical motion occurs. This is the equilibrium dis- cussed in the previous section. Note that for the equatorial neutral wind case (and if no F-region dynamo electric field is generated), the net hori- zontal plasma flow is actually zero, whereas for the applied eastward elec- tric field case, the net horizontal plasma flow is poleward. Curiously, this gravitational effect on the plasma flow only acts for equatorward wind and/or eastward electric field. The opposite signs merely act in consort with gravity to drive the plasma deep into the atmosphere, where it is lost to recombination—the postmidnight collapse effect. In the next chapter we show, after Perkins (1973), that in the former case the equilibrium represented by (5.22) is stable, provided that no meridional electric field and no zonal wind exist. We now turn to some experimental data aimed at trying to sort out these various processes. All these effects (and more!) seem to compete for control of the midlatitude F-layer plasma. An example in which the local dynamo effect seems to explain everything is illustrated in Fig. 5.16a and b. Two components of the plasma drift, the height of the F peak ( h max ) and the maximum value of the electron density, are plotted in Fig. 5.16a. The standard coordinate system in which the Arecibo data are presented differs from ours. In Fig. 5.14 and Figs. 5.16–5.18, the Arecibo-measured V || is positive for drifts anti-parallel to ˆ a z \u0003 ( V || is positive in the − B direction) and V ⊥ N is positive along the ˆ a y \u0003 direction. In Fig. 5.16a, the two middle curves are anticorrelated until about 0340 LT, when sunrise occurred in the conjugate hemisphere, which is a nonlocal effect. The plasma motion is therefore nearly horizontal all night long. Indeed, h max , only slowly changes from 2300 until 0300, which also shows that the vertical velocity was very small, averaging less than 1 m/s (downward) during this time.

The agreement between the meridional neutral wind direction and that of the corresponding horizontal ion wind is clear. The ion velocity is much smaller, however, suggesting that there may be a partial shorting out of the electric field in the local E region or in the conjugate hemisphere. Although consistent with an F-layer dynamo process, even this event raises some interesting questions. The relatively constant large ratio between local neu- tral wind and ion velocity implies that the electrical loading effect was larger than suggested in Fig. 5.12 for a local E-region load. Also the loading was relatively constant with time. This seems surprising considering the length of time involved. However, we note that the local height-integrated conductivity, which is propor- tional to n ν in , may have been relatively constant since the layer descended (larger ν in ) at the same time as the peak density was decreasing (2100 to 0100 LT). The density and height of the layer were subsequently relatively constant until 0330. If the conjugate F layer had a smaller neutral wind and a relatively constant height-integrated conductivity that was slightly higher than the local F-region conductivity, then it would act as a load and the data could be explained.

Unfortunately, no neutral wind data were taken on this night. The anticorrelation between V ⊥ N and V || and slow change of h max were occurring as usual until about 0300, when the tropical and low-latitude ionospheric dynamo was inter- rupted by the auroral event. The F-layer height increased dramatically due to the large eastward electric field, which was only partially compensated by the anticorrelation effect. To test this, the large observed downward V || has been superimposed on a calculated value of ( g /ν in ) sin I in Fig. 5.17b. The two curves match very well, illustrating the tendency of gravity to counter extreme vertical electrodynamic forcing. The peak height of the F layer surged upward when the applied field existed (trying to reach equilibrium) and then began to fall when the penetration electric field decreased. Although complex, these two days at least can be more or less explained in a straightforward manner.

Although counterintuitive, this situation can occur if a strong downward gravity-driven velocity is simultaneously present due to the high altitude of the layer. In fact, Burnside et al. (1983) have calculated the gravity term for this data set and have found that indeed the downward flow is sufficient to overpower the oppositely directed neutral wind during this time. In this same period (from 2130 LT until 0100), the perpendicular ion flow shown in Fig. 5.18a was upward, which corresponds to an eastward electric field. But the neutral wind was equatorward at this time, which would tend to generate a westward electric field component by the dynamo process. This rules out a local F-region dynamo process as a source of the electric field. Magnetic activity was low, so there is no reason to expect a magnetospheric origin for the eastward zonal electric field. A more likely explanation is an electric field that mapped from the other hemisphere. In fact, if the neutral wind extended into the Southern Hemisphere with the same direction (toward the south pole) and generated an F- layer dynamo field at the conjugate point, the zonal component in the Northern Hemisphere would be eastward as observed. This postulated south-poleward wind in the Southern Hemisphere would also tend to keep the F layer low, which in turn would enhance the Southern Hemisphere Pedersen conductivity. If two ends of a magnetic field line with differing dynamo wind fields compete for"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"254 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics the electric field, the region with the higher internal conductivity (lower internal resistance) will determine the electric field. Comparison of V || and V ⊥ N shows a remarkable anticorrelation with a net poleward horizontal ion flow prior to 0030 LT and an equatorward flow there- after. Although the individual behavior of V || and V ⊥ N can be accounted for by invoking nonlocal effects, the strong anticorrelation of the velocity compo- nents observed on this night cannot be explained using any of the conventional mechanisms discussed above. Certainly the local F-layer dynamo mechanism is not operating, as demonstrated by the ions moving oppositely to the local wind. The external electric field/gravity mechanism is also not operating, as witnessed by the lack of a net upward layer motion. (In fact, the F layer falls through- out the period 2100 to 0230 LT.) What is responsible for the close coupling of the V || and V ⊥ N velocity components on this night? We do not know. A great deal of careful comparison between optical data and radar data is likely to be necessary before we arrive at an understanding of F-layer dynamics on a night like this. 5.2.5 The Transition Zone Between Mid- and High Latitudes The magnetic dip angle increases very rapidly with increasing latitude. One effect is to decouple parallel and perpendicular dynamics. To some extent this simpli- fies the physics, since gravity and pressure gradients are most important in the vertical direction, while electric fields and neutral winds are most associated with horizontal motions of the plasma and neutral constituents. Atmospheric motions driven by solar heating still create E- and F-region dynamo electric fields, of course, but these sources are in competition with other processes. We have already pointed out the marked difference between the St. Santin/Arecibo nighttime observations and those at Millstone Hill, even during relatively quiet times. The strong implication is that some dominating high-latitude factor is present at L = 3 . 2, even during very modestly active times. This result is further emphasized in Fig. 5.19, where hourly averages of the electric field/zonal drift obtained on days with \r K p < 14 are plotted for the evening period (filled circles) along with the “low” K p Millstone Hill values published by Richmond et al. (1980), which were presented earlier in Fig. 5.8. The “superlow” K p electric field is found to be equatorward in the evening period, as is the normal evening case for both St. Santin and Arecibo. It seems that even in what one might consider magnetically quiet times, electrodynamics in the Millstone Hill area are strongly affected by high-latitude process. Two possible explanations were advanced by Gonzales et al. (1978). One is the direct penetration of the high-latitude electric field into the subauroral region. As we shall see in Chapter 8, this field has the proper sign, since the auroral zone electric field is poleward in the evening-to-midnight period, in agreement with the line plot in Fig. 5.19. This effect was studied at midlatitudes by Blanc (1983)."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"Hydro- and Electrodynamics of the Midlatitude Ionosphere 255 Millstone Hill 50 4 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6 0 2 50 2 100 0 3 6 9 12 15 Local time S K p # 14 (4 days) Eastward drift (m/s) Equator electric field (mV/m) 18 21 24 3 6 Figure 5.19 Average Millstone Hill equatorward electric field component measurements at equinox reproduced from Fig. 5.8 along with 1-hour averages of the same component during times of very low activity [Figure courtesy of C. Gonzales.] However, the situation is not so simple since the high-latitude field changes sign near midnight, switching from poleward to equatorward, which is not observed at Millstone Hill. Also, for Kp around 2 it is unlikely that high latitude electric fields can penetrate to such low L values. A second possibility is that the electric field is, after all, created by an F-region dynamo but that the local solar-driven winds are modified by high-latitude energy and momentum sources. The heat sources stem both from Joule heating and from particle precipitation into the atmosphere. The momentum source arises from the J × B forcing term where J = σ · E . In our previous discussion of this term, we showed that at low latitudes it yields the ion drag effect. In the neutral wind dynamo region J · E < 0 and the electric field is generated by the winds. At high latitudes the electric field is imposed on the ionosphere and J · E > 0. This shows that electrical energy is available for Joule heating as mentioned previously and that the J × B force is not so much a frictional drag on the neutrals as it is a mechanism for accelerating the thermospheric neutrals. At high latitudes the applied electric fields to first order form a two-celled plasma flow pattern which is virtually always present. It is not surprising then that the high-latitude neutral atmospheric motions are greatly affected by electrodynamic forcing. Suppose, as discussed in Chapter 9, that winds in the thermosphere are indeed driven across the polar cap by the plasma flow. The plasma turns to follow the auroral oval, but the wind has no such constraint. A flywheel- like effect may then occur with disturbance winds blowing out of the auroral oval even during relatively quiet times. Such winds would be reinforced by the equatorward pressure gradient due to Joule and particle heating in the auroral oval. Once equatorward of the oval, the Coriolis force will deflect the wind"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"256 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics toward the west. This wind, coupled with a negative meridional conductivity gradient, would then create a disturbance dynamo electric variation of field in the poleward direction. Just such a disturbance dynamo electric field may be responsible for the Millstone Hill measurements at very low Kp values. During very active times there is good evidence for such a wind pattern. Quiet-time neutral wind measurements at Fritz Peak, Colorado (39 . 9 ◦ N , 105 . 5 ◦ W ( L = 3 ) , for six nights are gathered in Fig. 5.20a, along with the predictions of a thermospheric global circulation model (Hernandez and Roble, 1984). The data and model both show eastward winds in the evening sector. On the other hand, measurements made on an active day and shown in Fig. 5.20b display strong westward winds until 0200 LT and an equally strong equatorward wind from 2300 until 0400 LT. The unusual wind pattern was detected only north of the station. 5.3 Midlatitude Lower Thermosphere Dynamics 5.3.1 Tidal Effects When the E-region conductivity is high, the electrodynamics are driven by tidal modes in the E-region. (These have already been discussed in Chapter 3.) As noted, the semidiurnal tidal mode becomes important at midlatitudes, and we expect that the daytime electric field will be dominated by semidiurnal tides at Millstone Hill and St. Santin. Both diurnal and semidiurnal tides should con- tribute at Arecibo. However, since the F-region dynamo and the high-latitude electric field sources are both primarily diurnal in form, we might expect the composite picture to be quite complex. This is borne out by the electric field data in Fig. 5.8. Arecibo, St. Santin, and Millstone Hill all display semidiur- nal variations in the zonal electric field component and diurnal behavior in the meridional field. Some of the richness of lower thermospheric dynamics may be visualized using motion of the layers that form in the ionosphere as natural tracers. Plasma density profiles over Arecibo for the period including sunset, sunrise, and the nighttime hours are presented in Figs. 5.21 and 5.22. The F layer slowly undulates with a several-hour period, whereas the lower-altitude layers exhibit both lower- and higher-period variations. E-region layers are very common over Arecibo, and the tidal modes can be visualized quite well. In the next chapter we discuss how the layers are formed, but for now we take their existence as an experimental fact and study their behavior. These lower-thermospheric oscillations are more obvious at night than during the day, since plasma production by sunlight tends to wash them out during the daytime. However, long-period oscillations such as diurnal and semidiurnal tides can be traced both day and night if some care is taken. Notice that the valley between the E and F layers has more plasma on the day with high Kp (Fig. 5.22) than on the previous night. This is due to energetic particle precipitation (Voss and Smith, 1979, 1980)."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Hydro- and Electrodynamics of the Midlatitude Ionosphere 257 UT LT 13 06 11 04 09 02 830307 830308 830309 830310 830312 830318 07 00 05 22 03 20 01 18 Time (a) 13 06 11 04 09 02 07 00 05 22 03 20 01 18 Data ave.

The results are plotted in Fig. 5.23 for 78 consecutive hours. A well-defined motion is seen in the central part of the time period (January 4) in which a layer starts descending from 150 km at 0600 LT, reaching 90 km at about midnight. Parts of the same pattern can be discerned on the previous day as well as on the following day, which suggests that a solar diurnal mode (S1) exists. However a similar pattern occurs 12 hours before and 12 hours later so the tide could be semidiurnal (S2) or an in-phase combination of S1 and S2. Furthermore, on January 5 there is a prominent six-hour tide (S4). A study of tides near the ground using surface pressure and GPS data shows that S1 through S6 are all energized (Humphreys et al., 2005). Higher-frequency motions are also clearly indicated in the figure. When discussing atmospheric waves, as the frequency increases above the tidal range, it is no longer necessary to discuss the atmospheric winds in terms of tidal modes because the horizontal wavelengths become much smaller than the radius of the earth. In this case the appropriate modes are termed internal inertiogravity waves, a topic we take up in some detail in the next chapter.

A number of ionospheric parameters have recently been found to exhibit a four-wave longitudinal variation at a fixed local time when averaged over sev- eral days. These parameters include the intensity of Appleton Anomaly emissions (Immel et al., 2006), the vertical drift/zonal electric field at the magnetic equa- tor (Kil et al., 2007), and the magnitude of the equatorial electrojet (England et al., 2006). The vertical drift case is shown in Fig. 5.24a, along with a study of the semidiurnal (S2) tide (Hagan and Forbes, 2003), which indicates both the migrating S2 tide and a mode 3 nonmigrating tide. The agreement is excellent and can be explained using Fig. 5.24b. The complex tide creates corresponding currents whose divergence leads to the electric field patterns.

Many of winds deduced from these trails are superimposed in Fig. 5.25a. The peak observed winds are much larger than predicted by tidal theory. On the other hand, they do have tidal properties. For example, the wind vector rotates with altitude as predicted for the tides. Another example is presented in Fig. 5.25b. Here a chemiluminescent meteor trail is shown 82 seconds after a Leonid meteor hit the atmosphere. A nearly perfect circle (corresponding to a helix-like structure) is seen on the image (Drummond et al., 2001), suggesting that a large amplitude inertiogravity wave is the source. Lasers can also be used to study winds and thus have become a powerful diag- nostic. If tuned to the 589 nm sodium line, a resonance fluorescent interaction increases the cross section enormously, making the sodium layer visible. The straight line from the middle of Fig. 5.25b to the right-hand side was generated by a sodium lidar. Created by meteor ablation, the sodium layer density can exceed 10 4 cm − 3 . One event in which TMA and lidar methods were used simul- taneously is shown in Fig. 5.26a and b. Here, lidar sodium echoes were obtained on a night when several rockets were fired. We have used the wind profile to generate the neutral atmospheric Richardson number, R i , for the event where R i = ω 2 b ( d | U | / dz ) 2 (5.26) and ω b is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency.

The down- ward streaks in the sodium are very related to the progression of the tidal ion layers operating in conjunction with sodium and sodium ion chemistry (Collins et al., 2002).

At midlatitudes the length of magnetic field lines containing high-density plasma is much shorter, gravity acts parallel to the magnetic field, and wind effects are at least as important as electric fields. We finally discuss internal gravity waves in some detail and explore their importance as well as that of energetic particle precipitation. Familiar plasma instabilities are extended to include finite dip angle and wind effects and some new processes, including the Perkins (F-layer) instability, the sporadic E-layer instability, neutral Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and thermal effects, are addressed. 6.1 Mesoscale Vertical Organization of Ionospheric Plasma: General Considerations Dynamical considerations, of course, do affect the dayside midlatitude iono- spheric content and altitude. However, production and recombination are suffi- ciently rapid to mask much of the structure in the medium other than large-scale vertical and horizontal gradients. At night, however, dynamics rules, and many interesting dynamic and electrodynamic processes contribute to the formation of mesoscale structures (50 − 1000 km horizontally and 0 . 5 − 50 km vertically). Two graphic examples of consecutive plasma density profiles detected in the nighttime Arecibo ionosphere were presented in Figs. 5.21 and 5.22. The April 16–17, 1974, night shown in Fig. 5.21 was very quiet magnetically, while the other night was moderately disturbed. The solar influence can be clearly seen at sunrise, when the deeply depressed plasma in the F-layer “valley” between 160 and 240 km altitude fills in and causes even the E-region structure to merge into the fairly featureless daytime ionospheric profiles at the top of each figure. The magnetically active night had a much higher valley plasma density. Some features are common to these and most other nights over Arecibo. The high- density F layer displays undulations with a typical period of 2 h in which the layer rose and fell by many tens of kilometers.

Whenever there are electrons to scatter from, the radar can detect motion and organization of the plasma. For example, often a piece of the F region seems to “peel off” the bottomside of the layer at sunset and to propagate downward into the F-layer valley region. Such a structure has been termed an intermediate layer by Shen et al. (1976), since it occurs between the F layer and the more classical sporadic E layers below. Since ionosonde signals are often reflected by the intense lower-altitude layers, the intermediate structures are not visible with an ionosonde and can be studied only via rockets or incoherent scatter radars such as the one at the Arecibo Observatory. The sporadic nature of the various lower layers, which gives them the name sporadic E, is evident in these profiles. The strongest intermediate layer lasted almost all night on April 17–18, while it died out at 0230 LT on April 5–6. Other more sporadic and weaker intermediate layers came and went on April 17–18. In the next two sections we discuss the formation and dynamics of these lay- ers, which are primarily due to oscillatory behavior of the neutral atmosphere. Such motions are classified as either tides or gravity waves depending on their frequency. Although, as we shall see, these neutral atmospheric motions are capa- ble of organizing the plasma into layered structures, this is not the entire story. The intermediate-layer ionization in particular cannot entirely be explained by photoionization processes, and we briefly discuss the observation and effect of ionizing energetic particle fluxes in this regard. F-region midlatitude plasma insta- bilities can amplify (or even create?) mesoscale structures as well. Finally, once the layers are formed, they may be subject to primary or second- ary plasma instability processes similar to those discussed for the equatorial zone, which lead to small scale structures, and we end the chapter with a brief discussion of such processes. 6.2 Oscillations of the Neutral Atmosphere From the discussion in Section 5.1, it is clear that when κ i = \u0003 i / v i \u0002 1, it is difficult to move plasma across magnetic field lines with a neutral wind. But if the neutral atmosphere has a velocity component parallel to the magnetic field, the plasma will be carried along B with the same velocity as the parallel compo- nent of the neutral atmosphere. Any horizontal neutral velocity with a compo- nent in the magnetic meridian will therefore create an F-region plasma velocity projected in the direction of the magnetic field. We previously discussed the fact that mean meridional neutral wind patterns cause F-region plasma motion upward or downward along B . Here we expand this discussion to include tides and gravity waves. Traditionally, upper thermospheric dynamics are discussed in terms of wind patterns rather than tidal modes, even though they display clear diurnal variations. On the other hand, long-period lower thermospheric"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Waves and Instabilities at Midlatitudes 269 dynamics are discussed in terms of propagating diurnal and semidiurnal atmo- spheric tides. This distinction is partly historical but is also related to the origin of the atmospheric forcing. The upper thermospheric winds are driven in situ by solar heating, Joule heating, and momentum transfer with the plasma, whereas the lower E-region winds are usually ascribed to upward-propagating tides gen- erated at tropospheric and/or stratospheric heights. The oscillation periods of the semidiurnal and diurnal propagating tides are, of course, 12 and 24 h, respec- tively. Higher-order tides also occur, but as the oscillation period nears several hours, the motions are usually referred to as gravity waves. Upper thermospheric forcing via solar UV heating has a strong diurnal component and drives an in situ diurnal tide. The upper atmosphere is continuously bombarded with gravity waves from a number of sources. These include tropospheric weather fronts, tornadoes and thunderstorms (Kelley, 1997; Hung et al., 1978), impulsive auroral zone momen- tum injection and heating events (Richmond and Matsushita, 1975; Nicolls et al., 2004), and even earthquakes (Kelley et al., 1985). The famous monograph enti- tled The Upper Atmosphere in Motion by Hines (1974) is an excellent annotated collection of gravity wave studies published by Hines and coworkers over about a 10-year period. The reader is referred to that work for details about gravity waves and tidal oscillations, as well as to the excellent review of tidal theory by Chapman and Lindzen (1970) mentioned earlier. Here our approach is much more modest in scope, aiming at physical intuition rather than detailed analysis. We study gravity waves first, in effect finding the normal modes of a flat nonrotating inviscid atmosphere. These results will be valid as long as the periods do not approach the tidal range and the wavelengths are not long enough that the curvature of the earth matters. We assume an isothermal, inviscid atmosphere initially in hydrostatic equilibrium, so that if ρ 0 and p 0 are the zero-order mass density and pressure, the relation ρ 0 g =−∇ p 0 applies. In addition, it can be shown that ρ 0 and p 0 , which vary only in the vertical direction in this model, are of the form ρ 0 , p 0 ∝ e − z / H where H is the scale height of the atmosphere—that is, 1 / H =− ( 1 /ρ 0 )( d ρ 0 / dz ) . Here we again choose our coordinates using the meteorological convention and take x eastward, y northward, and z vertically upward. We assume there are no neutral winds in the unperturbed atmosphere. The equations governing the behavior of the atmosphere are the mass continuity equation (2.2), the equation of motion (2.20), and the adiabatic condition (see Yeh and Liu, 1974). In the equation of motion, only terms due to gravity, pressure gradients, and inertia are retained."},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"270 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Now consider atmospheric oscillations in the presence of gravity. We assume there are small perturbations in the mass density, pressure, and wind veloc- ity denoted by δρ , δ p , and U = ( u , v , w ) . Without the Coriolis or viscous forces there is no coupling between oscillations in the y - z plane and those in the x direction, so we can ignore the x component of velocity, making the problem two-dimensional. For meridional propagation we define a column vector F by F = \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 δρ/ρ 0 δ p / p 0 v w \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 \u0002 and assume that atmospheric perturbations can be described by plane waves of the form F ∝ e i ( ω t − k y y − k z z ) (6.1) Substituting ρ = ρ 0 + δρ , p = p 0 + δ p , U = ( 0 , v , w ) into the equations describing the atmosphere (see Chapter 2) and retaining terms up to first order in δρ , δ p , and U gives the linearized forms of the mass continuity, motion, and adiabatic state equations—that is, ∂(δρ)/∂ t + U ·∇ ρ 0 + ρ 0 ∇· U = 0 (6.2a) ρ 0 ∂ v /∂ t + ∂(δ p )/∂ y = 0 (6.2b) ρ 0 ∂ w /∂ t + ∂(δ p )/∂ z + δρ g = 0 (6.2c) ∂(δ p )/∂ t + U ·∇ p 0 − C 2 0 ∂(δρ)/∂ t − C 2 0 U ·∇ ρ 0 = 0 (6.2d) We have taken the atmosphere to be isothermal with temperature T .

This leads to ∂(δ p )/∂ z = δ p [ ( 1 / p 0 )( dp 0 / dz ) − ik z ] and eventually to the corresponding entry in row 3. Setting the determinant of the 4 × 4 matrix equal to zero yields the dispersion relation for linear modes of a nonrotating neutral atmosphere on a flat earth, ω 4 − ω 2 C 2 0 \u0005 k 2 y + k 2 z \u0006 + ( γ − 1 ) g 2 k 2 y + i γ g ω 2 k z = 0 (6.3) A variety of possible wave modes are buried in this dispersion relation. Suppose we take the limit that g = 0. Then (6.3) reduces to ω 2 = C 2 0 \u0005 k 2 y + k 2 z \u0006 which is the dispersion relation for sound waves propagating without attenua- tion, growth (pure real ω and k ), or dispersion ( ω/ k = constant). We now turn to the gravity wave case. If there are no sources of energy or dissipation (viscosity was ignored), waves will not grow or decay in time at a fixed point in space, so we can assume ω is real. If we are including gravity, however, it can be shown that there are no solutions of (6.3) with both k y and k z purely real. Anticipating the final result, let us assume k y is purely real and investigate k z . This corresponds to a wave propagating in an unattenuated fashion with a component in the horizontal direction. Then we can write (6.3) as ω 4 − ω 2 C 2 0 k 2 y + (γ − 1 ) g 2 k 2 y =− i γ g ω 2 k z + ω 2 C 2 0 k 2 z (6.4) where the left-hand side is purely real. Now if we let k z be a complex number, k z = k \u0005 z + ik \u0005\u0005 z it is straightforward to show that the right-hand side of (6.4) is purely real if and only if k \u0005\u0005 z = ( 1 / 2 H ) Dropping the superscript (prime) notation, we can now see that the solutions for the quantities in the column vector F are of the form e i ( ω t − k y y − k z z ) e z / 2 H (6.5) In (6.5) ω , k y , and k z are real. Atmospheric waves that propagate in the manner described by (6.5) are termed internal gravity waves (IGW). Some of the complexity of the wind patterns that arise in the 90–120 km height range due to such waves can be gauged from the photograph of a trimethyl aluminum (TMA) vapor trail deployed by a sounding rocket, which is shown in Fig. 6.1.

From (6.5) the theoretical prediction is that the wave ampli- tude should grow as it propagates upward (positive z ). The physical explana- tion for this somewhat bizarre result is that to conserve the wave perturbation energy (e.g., terms of the form ρ 0 v 2 )as ρ 0 decreases with z , v 2 must increase. The factor of 2 in the exponential form occurs, since, in order to keep ρ 0 v 2 constant, v need only e -fold over a height interval 2 H when ρ 0 decreases by a factor of e in the height interval H . The classical observation supporting this result is shown in Fig. 6.2a. The dashed curve shows the mean wind. The actual wind fluctuates about this mean with an amplitude that increases with height. In Fig. 6.2b a detrended version of the same data is given after subtracting the mean and multiplying by exp [ ( 112 − z )/ 2 H ] where z and H are measured in kilo- meters.

Here we see how gravity waves can cre- ate electron density fluctuations at the level of ± 1% during daytime. Notice that the phase fronts move downward even though the energy propagates upward. This is a key feature of IGWs as well as tidal waves and causes the downward pro- gression of many plasma processes described here. The elemental linear theory cannot include viscosity, but damping can be estimated from the viscous damp- ing rate k 2 z ( v /ρ 0 ) . Two conclusions can be drawn from this expression: short vertical wavelengths are more heavily damped and, as ρ 0 goes down with alti- tude while ν changes little, viscous damping becomes more important. Turning to Fig. 6.3, notice that the short vertical wavelength features tend to disappear above 110 km due to the rapidly increasing viscosity with altitude. A longer vertical wavelength fluctuation still can be detected above 130 km, which is con- sistent with weaker viscous damping for smaller k z . Vadas and Fritts (2005) have developed a new formalism for describing the effects of viscosity in gravity wave propagation.

Eventually, either these waves break down nonlinearly due to their large amplitude or due to the fact that the kinematic viscosity ( ν/ρ 0 ) gets so large (as ρ 0 decreases) that viscous dissipation balances growth and eventually destroys the wave. Wave breaking is discussed in Chapter 7. Equation (6.4) can also be written in the form: ω 4 − ω 2 C 2 0 \u0005 k 2 y + k 2 z \u0006 + ω 2 b C 2 0 k 2 y − ω 2 a ω 2 = 0 (6.6) where ω 2 b = (γ − 1 ) g 2 / C 2 0 is the square of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency, ω 2 a = C 2 0 / 4 H 2 is the acoustic frequency, and where k y and k z are real. At a given value of k y ,if ω is large enough (the high-frequency branch with ω>ω a ) the first and second terms dominate and we recover the sound wave dispersion relation found previously for g = 0. The low-frequency branch corresponds to gravity waves that propagate only for ω<ω b . Physically, the Brunt-Väisälä frequency is the frequency at which a parcel of air oscillates about its equilibrium position when it is initially displaced from that position. For a nonisothermal atmosphere, one in which C 2 0 varies with height, it can be shown (Holton, 1979) that ω 2 b = (γ − 1 ) g 2 / C 2 0 + \u0003 g / C 2 0 \u0004\u0003 dC 2 0 / dz \u0004 (6.7a) and also ω 2 b = \u0005 g θ \u0006 d θ dz (6.7b) where θ is the potential temperature (the temperature that a parcel of air would attain if adiabatically brought to the ground). Both branches of this dispersion relation (and one more!) are shown in Fig. 6.4. For ω>ω a we have normal sound waves. There is a forbidden band where m ( k z ) is imaginary (dotted region) and then for ω<ω b we have inertio-internal gravity waves, which become modified near the inertial period, f , where f = 2 \u0003 sin θ ( \u0003 being the radian frequency corresponding to a day and θ being the latitude). Inertial waves are discussed following. Notice that IGWs travel much slower than the sound speed (for the same k ,ω is much less), which allows them to interact with winds. There is somewhat of a similarity here between the role of the plasma frequency in electrodynamics and the Brunt-Väisälä frequency in neutral dynamics. For a plasma to have propagation, you must have ω>ω p , the plasma frequency, while for IGWs ω<ω b is required for propagation. Both ω p and ω b represent natural oscillations of the medium. Representative values for the buoyancy period T b = ( 2 π/ω b ) derived from (6.7a,b) are plotted in Fig. 6.5 as a function of height.

The reader is asked to show that the product of the vertical phase and group velocities, (ω/ k z )( d ω/ dk z ) , is negative. Thus, in the important case of upward energy propagation, when d ω/ dk z is positive, the vertical phase velocity is downward. This downward phase propagation is evident in Fig. 6.3 and, as we shall see, explains why the plasma layers in Fig. 5.23a and c all move downward, at least, on average. It is crucial to note that in (6.8) ω is the intrinsic frequency, the wave frequency in the neutral wind reference frame. The Doppler formula relates ω to ω \u0005 , ω \u0005 = ω + k · u where ω \u0005 is the frequency in the frame in which u is measured (usually the earth frame). When the horizontal wave phase velocity in the earth frame matches the wind velocity, ω = 0 and the wave simply vanishes. This is called a critical layer. Such a layer cannot happen for the sound wave branch, since the wind would have to be supersonic. But IGW waves are much slower, and critical layers happen all the time. For example, consider an isotropic wave source in the lower atmosphere propagating up into an atmospheric jet. As long as ω/ k < u peak ,a critical layer must be found for waves nearly parallel to the jet. Waves in the other direction are simply upshifted and go right through. (This is illustrated in Fig. 7.5 in the next chapter.) Waves propagating into the critical layer add their momentum to the layer when they are absorbed. This accelerates the jet even more. A classic example is the quasi-biennial oscillation in which a critical layer moves downward as gravity waves are absorbed in the stratosphere. The process requires almost two years to complete a cycle of zonal wind reversal at a given height (Holton, 1979). If we ignore the curvature of the earth but allow the wave frequency to approach f = 2 \u0003 sin θ , then the rotation of the earth cannot be ignored. The frequency f is called the inertial frequency and is equal to 2 π/τ F , where τ F is the time it takes for the plane of oscillation of a Foucault pendulum to return to its initial plane at t = 0. At the latitude of Arecibo this period is 52 hours. Such long-period waves are not easy to study, but they have been observed in the stratosphere (Cornish and Larsen, 1989; Cho, 1995). Another observation that seems to be due to such a wave at 35 ◦ latitude in this frequency range is shown in Fig. 6.6. Here a long-duration Leonid meteor trail was photographed 82 seconds after the meteor struck the atmosphere (Kelley et al., 2003c). The trail formed into a helix, and the mean wind, u , the perturbation wind, δ u , and the vertical wave number ( k z ) could be measured (Drummond et al., 2001). The ambient temperature profile was determined using a lidar located at the same site"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"278 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics (Starfire Optical Range in New Mexico). The characteristics of inertial period waves are an extension of the gravity wave dispersion relation and can be written in the form ω 2 = ω 2 b k 2 y + k 2 z f 2 k 2 z + k 2 y (6.9) where we have taken k 2 z \u0002 ( 1 / 2 H ) 2 for an isothermal atmosphere (Eckart, 1960). This is the lowest frequency wave in Fig. 6.4. Note that if f = 0 and k 2 z \u0002 1 / 4 H 2 , (6.8) becomes ω 2 = ω 2 b k 2 y k 2 z + k 2 y (6.10) which agrees with (6.8) and (6.9) for f = 0. By using the fact that the wind vector rotated with altitude, Drummond et al. (2001) found that the wave responsible for the trail shape in Fig. 6.6 had the properties of an inertial wave. In general, an elliptical pattern arises for waves with ω i = 2 π f <ω<ω b with the ratio of Figure 6.6 Photo of a long-duration meteor trail 82 seconds after impact.

Due to the lidar data, this event is impor- tant because it is the most complete data set ever obtained. Other examples of rotating winds exist from TMA rocket releases but simultaneous lidar data did not exist. This event shows that an 8-hour wave in the earth frame, which might be considered a gravity wave or a higher-order tide, is actually an inertial gravity wave. Turning to the tidal case, complications arise in the analysis because of the requirement that the solutions satisfy boundary conditions on the spherical earth. The solutions must exhibit certain altitudinal, latitudinal, and longitudinal forms referred to as Hough functions. Which propagating tidal normal modes actually are generated depends on how well the forcing function—for instance, solar or lunar forcing—matches the radial form of the mode structure. As alluded to earlier in the Chapter 3 discussion of electrodynamics, the diurnal tide due to atmospheric heating is important at low latitudes, but the response is small above 30 ◦ latitude. The semidiurnal forcing is smaller, but the altitude pro- files of ozone and water vapor content fit the so-called (2,2) semidiurnal tidal mode quite well. The local heating due to these minor constituents thus couples well to the semidiurnal tide, explaining its importance at the higher latitudes. The solar heating function is similar to a half-wave rectifier, since it is on for only half of a day. This means higher-order Fourier components exist, and thus higher-order tides are expected. In the layer motions of Fig. 5.23c, some are separated regularly by about 6 hours. This may be a higher-order tide, but the analysis of Drummond et al. (2001) shows that an 8-hour period in the earth frame was actually a 20-hour inertio-gravity wave, not a third-order tide. Thus, great care must be taken in interpreting long-period waves. Recently a number of studies have revealed that a wave number three, nonmigrating diurnal tide (Hagan et al., 2003) creates a four-model perturbation in many ionospheric parameters, including the equatorial electric (Kil et al., 2007) and magnetic (England et al., 2006) fields and the intensity of the anomaly plasma density (Immel et al., 2006). 6.3 Role of Gravity Waves and Tides in Creating Vertical Ionospheric Structure Given that gravity waves, inertio-gravity waves, and tides can be generated by a variety of sources and that they grow to respectable amplitudes by the time they reach ionospheric heights, we can now investigate their effect on the ionization.

This equation is equivalent to the assumption of incompressible flow ∇· U = 0 when expressed in Fourier form and holds for all the low frequency waves considered here. This is the Boussinesq approximation, which uses ∇· U = 0 for wave perturbations when ω<ω b but allows for compressibility in the zero-order equations. Equation (6.11) can also be written | v / w |=| λ y /λ z | Typically, λ y \u0002 λ z for the periods of interest here, so v \u0002 w . That is, the horizontal component of the perturbation wind is much stronger than the ver- tical, and we explore its effect on the plasma next. An example of the plasma layering that occurs is presented in Fig. 6.7. Here the Arecibo radar has been used in a high-resolution mode to best characterize these thin layers. Interesting structures occur for many hours. Remarkably, the neutral sodium atoms revealed by a sodium lidar also seem to be layered. At first this is surprising, since the plasma layers only occur due to magnetic forces, which do not affect the neutrals. However, recent advances in our understanding of ion and neutral sodium chemistry seem capable of explaining these atom layers (Cox and Plane, 1998; Swartz et al., 2002). We return to this topic later in this section. As a first study, consider the F-layer valley where κ i is large. For a wave having a small vertical wavelength, we have sketched the horizontal component of wind fluctuations for a typical gravity wave as a function of height in Fig. 6.8. This figure illustrates the case in which the perturbation wind lies in the magnetic meridian and, as also shown, the magnetic field has a finite dip angle.

A layer of ionization will arise in the convergence zone. This wind shear theory for layer formation was first suggested by Dungey (1959), was extended by Whitehead (1961), and seems to explain many of the observations quite well for intermediate layers. The situation illustrated in Fig. 6.8 is most effective in the lower F region. At higher altitudes, diffusion parallel to B keeps sharp layers from forming. This can be seen by comparing the time constant at which plasma converges, which is of the order of ( k z v cos I ) − 1 , with the time constant at which it diffuses, which is of the order of ( k 2 z D A ) − 1 . For D A ≥ v cos I / k z diffusion is too strong for layers to form. For λ z ≤ 2 π H and v cos I 10 m/s, we can estimate the critical value for D A to be roughly 10 4 m 2 /s at 200 km. For molecular ions at 500 ◦ K, D A = 64 × 10 4 /ν n m 2 /s and thus we find that gravity waves are not very efficient in producing layers above about 200 km because diffusion is too fast. At heights below 130 km, the high collision frequency with neutrals merely pushes the ions horizontally, and no layers are formed due to meridional winds. However, shears in the zonal wind component can take over the production of layers below about 130 km. The mechanism stems from the Lorentz force felt by the ions when subject to a wind field. For example, referring to (2.22b), which gives a general relation for the ion velocity, we are interested in the equilibrium case where d V i / dt = 0. In addition, we ignore the effects of E , ∇ n , and g and consider collisions between ions and neutrals only.

Let the wind be strictly zonal ( U = u ˆ a x ) and ignore the magnetic declination.

The net velocity is illustrated in Fig. 6.9a. For larger κ i the deflection angle is larger and for smaller κ i the ion motion is nearly parallel to U . The mechanism that creates the plasma layers is illustrated in Fig. 6.9b for the case of a vertical shear in the zonal wind. As shown by (6.13a), ions above the shear point drift down- ward, while those below drift upward. Plasma accumulates where the zonal wind is zero. Note that in the last sentence we shifted from a discussion of ion motion to a statement about plasma accumulation . In the geometry of Figs. 6.9a, with the magnetic field perfectly horizontal, the highly magnetized (high κ e ) electrons could not move perpendicular to B to join the converging ions. Furthermore, the field lines bend into a very low plasma region, and there is no source of electrons to move along the magnetic field lines and neutralize the ions. A huge space charge electric field would build up, and the whole process would grind to a halt.

This keeps the plasma charge neutral and allows the plasma to build up into the layers cited above. This mechanism is thus most efficient at low and middle latitudes. The wind shear process can be considered as an example of the compressibility of the ionospheric plasma in the direction perpendicular to B when κ i ≈ 1. As noted earlier, F-region perpen- dicular plasma flow is virtually incompressible ( ∇ ⊥ · V ⊥ ) = 0 but in the lower F and E regions this is not the case. If we consider a meridional wind, the Lorentz force only deflects ions east-west and thus has no effect on producing vertical layering, but it could create horizontal patchiness in the layers if the winds are periodic, as in gravity waves. The wind shear theories outlined here yield a very nice dynamical explanation for ionospheric layering. The downward progression of the layers is accounted for, since gravity wave and tidal theories both predict downward phase propa- gation for an upward group velocity (expected for lower atmospheric sources). The theory initially ran into quantitative difficulty, however, since the standard recombination rate at the heights of interest was too large to support the observed layer densities (up to 10 6 cm − 3 ). But rocket data show that metallic ions such as Mg + ,Si + , and Fe + due to meteoric sources proved to be the dominant ions in these layers (Herrmann et al., 1978). This fact removed objections to the wind shear theory, since such ions have very long lifetimes. An example of the ion composition measured in a sporadic E layer during a daytime rocket flight is presented in Fig. 6.9c. The \u000e M + curve shows all the metal ions that track the peaks in the electron density quite well and constitute more than half of all the ions, even during the daytime. Such data strongly support the notion that metallic ions are responsible for long-lived intense sporadic E layers. The inter- mediate layers remain a problem, however, since they do not contain metallic ions. One resolution of this problem, discussed in some detail in the next section, involves additional ionizing radiation at midlatitudes over and above the usual photoionization sources. Neglecting ionization and recombination, and assuming that all variables are functions of z \u0005 only, the relation between the altitude profile of plasma density produced by the neutral motion and dN / dz \u0005 has been calculated by Gershman (1974). Assuming \u0003 e sin I \u0002 ν en and \u0003 i sin I \u0006 ν in , as in Gershman’s derivation, the inverse vertical scale length of the plasma density gradient is given by L − 1 = dN ( z \u0005 ) dz \u0005 \u0007 N ( z \u0005 ) = \u0003 i cos I v in D A \b u − \t \u0003 i v in sin I + v en \u0003 e sin I v \u000b (6.14) where u e and v n correspond to the maximum zonal (positive eastward) and meridional (positive northward) winds about the shear point. D A is the ambipo- lar diffusion coefficient. Substituting reasonable values for these parameters, we find L < 100 m, which is smaller than observed.

Finally, we note that a wind shear is not necessary for all layer formation. A westward Northern Hemispheric wind will drive ions downward but into an ever increasing atmosphere. Collisions (low κ i ) cause the vertical velocity to decrease with decreasing altitude and a layer forms. A southward electric field has the same effect. As seen in the various examples of sporadic E layers, as their altitude decreases, they seem to come nearly to rest below 95 km. In this height range, ion chemical reactions by metal ions become much more frequent and eventually they are destroyed chemically. These metallic ions have their origin in the ablation of meteors. This source also leads to copious metallic atoms in the 90–100 km altitude range. The existence of sodium, iron, and potassium atoms allows the use of resonant lidar scatter to study this important height range. In the case of sodium, Cox and Plane (1998) first seriously studied sodium ion chemistry and attempted to explain the atom layers. A slightly modified version of their chemical model is illustrated in Fig. 6.10. A crucial reaction rate was incorrect in the earlier study, and the initial results did not fit the data very well. In conjunction with new data taken at Arecibo and a revised reaction rate for the NaO + + N 2 → Na + N 2 + O and NaO + + O 2 → Na + + O 3 branches, Collins et al. (2002) have produced much better agreement. Through such interactions, sodium ions can maintain sodium atom layers (see Fig. 6.7). Na 1 ? N 2 Na 1 ?

It is clear that photon sources such as galactic x-rays and scattered Lyman α (from the geocorona) cannot produce much ionization above 105 km. Par- ticle ionization sources are thus surprisingly important at midlatitudes, and it seems that the primary component involves positively charged particles rather than electrons, which produce most of the auroral ionization. Evidence in sup- port of this hypothesis is given in Fig. 6.11c for a rocket flight over Wallops Island, Virginia ( L = 2 . 6). In comparing the two curves, electrons contribute only about 10% of the count rate in the energy range surveyed. A schematic lati- tude profile of precipitating particles based on satellite observations is reproduced in Fig. 6.12. Positive particles dominate in three bands: equatorial, midlatitude, and the subauroral zone. Electrons dominate in the auroral zone proper and in a “low” latitude region between 20 ◦ and 30 ◦ . The schematic picture is valid when averaged over longitude. However, in the Northern Hemisphere, the midlati- tude zone disappears almost entirely between 45 ◦ W and 75 ◦ E. Conversely, the low-latitude electron zone disappears between 135 ◦ W and 150 ◦ W. These latter effects are due to the South Atlantic anomaly, a region of unusual magnetic field strength that modifies the mirror heights of energetic particles quite drastically. The equatorial zone is due to the charge exchange of ring current ions with the geocorona. The energetic neutrals cross the field lines and are focused in the equatorial zone (Pröllss, 1973).

The production rate is very low, but neutral atmospheric waves gather the ions and produce easily observable features in the plasma profile. To this are added meteoric sources of metallic ions at lower altitudes. There, long-lived ions are also gathered together by wind and wave patterns to form the ionization layers observed. 6.5 Horizontal Structure in the Midlatitude Ionosphere Studies by Bowman (1981, 1985) seem to show clearly that much of midlatitude spread F as registered on ionosondes is due to altitude modulation of the electron density in the F layer, most likely due to gravity waves. Some of the more violent disturbances that include small-scale structure most likely also involve the plasma instabilities discussed following. Since these features propagate, they are referred to as traveling ionospheric disturbances or TIDs. We have concentrated thus far on vertical ionospheric structure, since it is far easier to observe. Ionosondes usually are directed vertically but can detect hori- zontal variations due to their broad antenna patterns. Bowman (1981, 1985) has described and reviewed the results of such observations.

A single vertically pointed ionosonde would obtain echoes from several ranges due to these tilts—hence the name range spread F. Such plasma observations of TIDs were part of the data set that led Hines to develop the neutral wave theory described in Section 6.2. One must remember, though, that the neutral gas is not measured directly in these and in other TID obser- vations. Figure 6.13b shows that longer wavelength features do not create the same sort of spread in the trace. However, Fig. 6.13c shows that the associ- ated long-period features can be detected by ionosondes using time variation of plasma contours. Here, 1.5-hour periodicity is found, which has the characteris- tic downward phase progression associated with gravity waves. Bowman (1981, 1985) used the term “large” to include the 200 km scale feature in Fig. 6.13c. Here we reserve that term for structures greater than 500 km and use the term medium scale or mesoscale for features in the range of 50 to 500 km. Large-scale TIDs are usually very fast and come equatorward out of the auroral zone. A computer simulation of a neutral atmospheric disturbance launched by a high-latitude heating event was presented in Section 3.5. It is clear that such a pulse would drive the midlatitude ionosphere upward due to the southward wind and that this uplift would seem to travel equatorward. Less obvious is the fact that a temperature enhancement also changes the composition of the lower thermosphere, decreasing the O/N 2 ratio. Such a composition effect changes the production and recombination rates in the F region in such a way that a negative midlatitude ionospheric storm often accompanies a geomagnetic storm (see Fig. 5.1). An example of the negative phase of an ionospheric storm is shown in Fig. 6.14a, in which five consecutive nights of Arecibo plasma density profiles are shown during a modest magnetic storm in September 1999. Nights 1, 2, and 4 in this sequence had depressed nighttime densities relative to the climatologi- cal prediction shown in the final panel. These nights are consistent with the low values of f 0 F 2 in the storm-related time series presented in Fig. 5.1. Examples of descending (intermediate) layers and sporadic E layers are also evident, as are height variations of the F layer with several-hour periodicities. For gravity waves with k vectors near the meridian, the alternating poleward and equatorward per- turbation wind will create corresponding downward and upward F-layer plasma motions. These will be detected as TIDs. In addition, when the plasma is pushed downward, it will recombine more quickly, enhancing the ionospheric storm effect. An event of this type is presented in Fig. 6.14b, in which extreme oscillations of the F layer occurred over Arecibo due to a large-scale TID. When the layer reached its highest altitude just before sunrise, the bottomside of the layer clearly went unstable, most likely up to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (Nicolls and Kelley, 2005). Analysis of the corrugation of the layer all evening showed that at an earth-fixed frequency of 30 minutes the corrugations grew exponentially and broke into the striations seen in Fig. 6.14b.

These storm-enhanced density (SED) features, one of which is presented in Fig. 6.14c, exhibit total electron content values of nearly 200 × 10 16 cm − 2 . They typically develop in the late afternoon and form a channel of high density at midlatitudes, which becomes entrained in the convection and moves into the auroral oval and polar cap (Foster et al., 2002). The origin seems to be the dayside equator where high eastward electric fields continually pump solar-produced plasma up and into the equatorial fountain (Vlasov et al., 2003). We have already discussed prompt penetrating electric fields (PPE) and their effect at the equator in Chapter 4. SED events are very likely a midlatitude effect of both zonal and meridional electric fields penetrating to low latitudes. Meridional PPE fields are more difficult to study using the ISR technique, although Fig. 3.23 shows how a shift to B z north decreases an auroral zonelike penetrating meridional field over Millstone Hill ( L = 3 . 2). Rowland and Wygant (1998) have used double probe electric field instruments (see Appendix A) in the CRESS satellite for this purpose. They showed that as Kp increases, the radial component of the electric field penetrates deeper and deeper into the mid- to low latitudes. Note that the radial electric field in the equatorial plane maps to a meridional component in the ionosphere. For a Kp of 5 or more, this component is affected for L values as low as 2. 6.6 Midlatitude F-Region Plasma Instabilities In this section the plasma physics of the midlatitude F-region ionosphere is dis- cussed. Many of the processes are similar to those discussed already in Chapter 4 and thus need only be briefly reintroduced. E-region processes are presented in Section 6.7. 6.6.1 F-Region Plasma Instabilities in the Equatorial Anomaly (Equatorial Arc) Region The plasma bubbles discussed in Chapter 4 are electrodynamically produced, so they involve uplift of the entire flux tube. Indeed, the radar map in Fig. 4.4 and the all-sky image from Christmas Island in Fig. 4.7a show that the depletions are field aligned. These flux tubes reach sufficiently high altitudes that they map into the equatorial anomaly. Just such an effect is shown in Fig. 6.15a, an all- sky camera airglow photograph taken in the anomaly region over Ascension Island (geographic position 8 ◦ S, 14 ◦ W). The dark bands correspond to plasma depletions near 300 km altitude, where the airglow originates.

These wedges tilt to the west as noted in Chapter 4 and seem to give definitive proof of the wedge versus bubble geometry for the equatorial depletions. Observations of the equatorial anomaly from the TIMED satellite often display dark bands. Comparison with an airglow camera on the ground as in Fig. 6.15b shows that they are of CEIS origin. These depletion regions owe their origin to an equatorial phenomenon but in turn create the seed for very strong local off-equatorial F-region instabilities. This stems from their associated east-west horizontal density gradients. Such gradients are unstable to the generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability discussed in Chapter 4. To first order, gravity does not play a role, since g is perpendicular to ∇ n for a horizontal gradient. For g = 0, the criterion for instability discussed in Chapter 4 is ( E \u0002 × B ) ·∇ n > 0 (6.15a) where E \u0002 = E + U × B (6.15b) is the electric field that would be measured in the neutral frame of reference, while E and U are the electric field and neutral wind vectors in the earth-fixed frame, respectively.

The depletions should thus structure on one side or the other, depending on the zonal neutral wind direction. Since the equatorial anomaly region is one of very high electron density—the highest average electron density anywhere in the earth’s ionosphere—the effect of such structuring on transionospheric propagation is very pronounced. The scintillation technique discussed in Appendix A has been used extensively in the anomaly region to characterize the structure there and to better understand the scintillation process itself. Even at a transmission frequency of 6 GHz, up to 6 dB of scintillation-induced amplitude variation has been detected in this region. An example of data from the anomaly is shown in Fig. 6.16a and b.

Data from five consecutive traversals are shown in Fig. 6.16b. The line-of-sight total electron content (TEC) and the scintillation level at 249 MHz are depicted for each pass. The westward edge is clearly more structured than the eastward edge, which is consistent with the preceding discussion and the fact that the wind is usually eastward at this local time and latitude. Structures on the top and eastward regions are probably due to instabilities caused by large-scale secondary perturbation electric fields δ E , which can also create δ E × B instabilities on the gradients. Many “active experiments” have been conducted at midlatitudes to model this process by creating artificial plasma density gradients perpendicular to B and observing the resulting structure. The active technique is to inject large amounts of barium gas into the ionosphere from a rocket, where the barium is vaporized from the metal state by the intensely energetic thermite chemical reaction. The barium is ionized by sunlight and, if released at sunset or sunrise, results in a visible long-lived plasma made usable by resonant scattering of sunlight (see Appendix A for more details). A photograph of such a release made over the Gulf of Mexico is given in Fig. 6.17. Notice that striated regions form in the plasma and that they occur in only a portion of the cloud. The ultimate active experiment was conducted in the mid-1960s when a nuclear explosion was carried out in the ionosphere. The right-hand side of Fig. 6.18 shows the result, which has a similar appearance to Fig. 6.17 and to another barium cloud photograph to the left. Remarkably, even the spacing of the striations are comparable, on the order of 500–1000 m. The physics here is that of the deceleration of the blast as it expands outward, carrying a plasma with it.

This condition is then linearly unstable to the generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability. After the nuclear test ban treaty, barium cloud releases fueled further understanding of the nuclear case as well as CEIS/ESF and led to the computer simulations, which eventually led to the equatorial simulations presented in Chapter 4. Whether a cloud is large or small depends on its electrical properties. A small cloud is required whenever the barium technique is used for tracer experiments, such as those discussed in relation to Fig. 3.12. The circuit diagram analogy in Fig. 6.19a applies if we associate R 2 with the reciprocal of the field line-integrated Pedersen conductivity in the cloud [ R 2 = (\u000e Pc ) − 1 ], while R 1 , is the inverse of the field line-integrated conductivity in the background ionosphere [ R 1 = (\u000e Pb ) − 1 ]. if R 1 \u0006 R 2 , the full ambient potential appears across the cloud and it drifts with the full velocity E × B / B 2 . If the cloud is large ( \u000e Pc >\u000e Pb ), the ambient electric field is shorted out and the cloud moves more slowly than the background. This has in fact been observed during a rocket flight, which traversed a dense barium plasma cloud. The data in Fig. 6.19b show that the electric field was indeed lower inside the barium cloud than outside (Schutz et al., 1973)."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Waves and Instabilities at Midlatitudes 299 2 5 2 5 2 4 2 8 2 4 2 8 0 0 8 4 0 8 4 0 90 Westward electric field (mV/m) Southward electric field (mV/m) 120 150 180 Time (sec) 210 240 270 D B w gammas D B s gammas (b) R 2 5 ( S Pc ) 2 1 R 1 5 ( S P b ) 2 1 V 0 1 2 (a) Figure 6.19 (a) Circuit diagram analog for the effect of a barium cloud on the electro- dynamics of the ionosphere.

Another way to understand the instability of a barium cloud and formation of the striations that are apparent in the photograph in Figs. 6.17 and 6.18 involves the shorting effect discussed previously.

If we work in the neutral frame of reference where U = 0, then E \u0002 is the electric field and E \u0002 × B / B 2 is the background plasma flow velocity in that reference frame. A region of enhanced plasma density will have an elevated field line-integrated Pedersen conductivity and, due to the shorting effect, will drift slower than the adjacent depleted region for which \u000e P is lower. Now since ( E \u0002 × B ) is parallel to ∇ n , the lower-density region will move up the gradient to regions of higher surrounding density, while the high-density region will move down the gradient. Thus, relative to the surroundings, both enhancements and depletions seem to grow in intensity, and we say the configuration is unstable. This argument is equivalent to that associated with Fig. 4.9. Midlatitude barium cloud striations have been penetrated by instrument-laden sounding-rocket payloads. Data from one such experiment are reproduced in Fig. 6.20. The smooth, enhanced-density profile due to the plasma cloud is inter- rupted on one edge by fingers of alternating high and low plasma density.

The similarity is remarkable and gives further evi- dence that the active barium cloud experiment indeed mirrors natural phenom- ena quite well. This barium cloud spectrum is included in the set presented in Fig. 4.5a, which dramatically shows the similarity to CEIS/ESF spectra. The growth rate for the E × B instability for a “local” calculation, ignoring, among other things, the plasma effects due to electrical coupling along the mag- netic field lines is (from Chapter 4), γ = E \u0005 / BL (6.16a) where L is the inverse gradient scale length of the cloud. For typical midlatitude conditions E \u0005 / B = 50 m/s while typical barium clouds have L ∼ 6000 m, and thus γ ∼ = (2 min) − 1 . For the natural case the growth rates are lower since the gradients are weaker but they are still significant.

Considerable effort has gone into the barium cloud striation problem, and a vast literature exists. Much of this research is applicable to naturally occurring spread F phenomena as well. Some subtleties that arise involve the effect of velocity shear on the instability, which is a stabilizing factor (Perkins and Doles, 1975), and the production of image striations in the background ionosphere (Goldman et al., 1976). Both of these processes introduce additional scale size factors into the linear growth rate expression. These processes are discussed further in Chapter 10. 6.6.2 Local Midlatitude F-Region Plasma Instabilities: A New Process A few early experimental results indicated that something new was happening at midlatitudes. Most notable were data reported by Behnke (1979) using the Arecibo radar. He found what he called height-layer bands aligned from NW to SE and traveling in the southwest direction. Adjacent bands sometimes were displaced from each other by 80 km in altitude. One structure was found to have an internal electric field five times the average background electric field and corresponding to drifts exceeding 400 m/s. The next breakthrough was from the MU radar, which reported regular patches of 3 m irregularities moving across the various beams (Fukao et al., 1990; Kelley and Fukao, 1991). An example of such data is presented in Fig. 6.22. Three patches of high-echo strength are shown in the top panels, and the corre- sponding line-of-sight Doppler shifts are plotted in the lower panels. Large away drifts accompany the strong echoes, and at the edges, as the signals disappear, they weaken and even downward irregularity motions occur. The patches moved westward from beam to beam. Airglow observations at 630 nm have greatly clarified the situation (Mendillo et al., 1997; Garcia et al., 2000a; Saito et al., 2001). Figure 6.23 shows five midlatitude examples over Puerto Rico and Hawaii and contrasts them with an image taken from Christmas Island during equatorial CEIS conditions. The latter features are very elongated and aligned with the magnetic meridian. The midlatitude structures are more localized and make a large angle with the mag- netic meridian. Another key difference is the motion of these structures; their phase fronts almost invariably move in the southwest direction, as illustrated in Fig. 6.24. Since the process is not yet understood for mesoscale structures, next we will consider the only existing theoretical development before present- ing more observations to provide a context for interpretation. Figure 6.25 shows the plasma density and plasma drift/electric field observa- tions associated with two uplift events over Arecibo. From 2215 to 2345 LT and again from 0100 to 0215 the ionosphere was elevated by 100 km altitude rela- tive to adjacent time periods, and the associated electric field was highly unusual. A perpendicular southward perturbation drift was accompanied by a perpendic- ular east drift (e.g., at 2340 AST).

Prior to this, a cycle of opposite phase can be seen with perturbation north and western drifts occur- ring before the uplift occurred. The uplift/downdraft cycle is due to the pertur- bation electric fields in an electrostatic wave for which ∇× E =− ik · E = 0. This was even more dramatically shown by Shiokawa et al.

Before studying any instability, it is important to first describe the equilibrium for which stability is addressed. First, we note that without an eastward electric field, equilibrium can only exist exactly at the magnetic equator where the J g × B force due to gravitational cur- rents can balance the vertical gravity term in the force balance equation: J g × B + ρ g = 0 At the equator, J g has magnitude ρ g / B and is directed toward the east. The Rayleigh-Taylor theory given in Chapter 4 shows that this equilibrium is not stable. In general, using (2.36b) for m \u0006 M , J g = (ρ/ B 2 ) g × B , and if the magnetic field has a dip angle I , then the J g × B force is J g × B =+ ρ g cos I ˆ a z (6.17) where the coordinates are defined in Fig. 5.15.

The situation in Fig. 6.14b is unique in that it seems to describe a situation that is not in equilibrium but remains at a high enough altitude for a long enough time that gravitational current can drive the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Perkins noted, however, that an equilibrium was possible if the plasma was supported against gravity by a southward neutral wind, U s . In this case, the condition for no vertical ion motion is: U s cos I sin I = ( g /< v in >) sin 2 I (6.18a) The situation is illustrated in Fig. 6.14a. On Sept. 16–17, 1999, the post- sunset ionosphere was held aloft stably for several hours and then fell quickly into the atmosphere and almost disappeared. In the stable equilibrium state, if the ionosphere is displaced upward, \u0010 v in \u0011 decreases and gravity causes it to fall back. If it is displaced downward, the wind (or electric field) causes it to move back up to the equilibrium height. On other nights it seems that the effective wind was variable, causing modulations of the equilibrium, but near midnight a general collapse occurred."},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"310 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Perkins’ breakthrough idea was to note that the entire layer could equally well be considered a single particle if the content was integrated over altitude. This is the field line-integrated ionospheric model, also known as the Ping-Pong ball model, which is illustrated in Fig. 5.10. In (6.18a), \u0010 v in \u0011 is the plasma density- weighted collision frequency \u0010 v in \u0011= ∫ ( n ( z ) v in ( z ) dz ∫ n ( z ) dz = ∫ n ( z ) v in ( z ) dz N The field line-integrated Pedersen conductivity is thus \u000e P = Ne 2 \u0010 v in \u0011 / M \u0003 2 i . Equivalently, an eastward electric field can support the layer in the vertical direction. In this case the condition becomes E e B cos I = ( g / \u0010 ν in \u0011 ) sin 2 I (6.18b) If u s and E e are given, 6.18a and b can be combined and solved for \u0010 v in \u0011 , which can be expressed as \u0010 v in \u0011 ( h ) = \u0011 g sin 2 I u s cos I sin I + ( E e / B ) cos I \u0012 (6.19) Since \u0010 v in \u0011 ( h ) is a monotonically decreasing function of height, this equation determines the height of the F layer. In the electric field case there is a net pole- ward horizontal motion as the ionosphere moves up perpendicular to B and falls down parallel to B . For a pure southward wind there is no net equatorward displacement of the layer. For a Chapman alpha-layer it can be shown that \u0010 v in \u0011= v in ( h max ) . Perkins used the height-integrated Pedersen conductivity as one of his variables \u000e P = e 2 M i \u0003 2 i \u0013 n ( z )ν in ( z ) dz = e 2 N M i \u0003 2 i \u0010 ν in \u0011 (6.20) Thus, \u000e P is also a surrogate for height. Since the electric field does not vary along B , the potential is also a “layer” variable. Perkins derived two time derivatives of importance: ∂ N ∂ t = 0 (6.21a) ∂\u000e P ∂ t = eg sin 2 I \u0003 BH N − \u000e P E e cos I BH (6.21b) where H is the neutral scale height.

The second equation can be"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"Waves and Instabilities at Midlatitudes 311 written as: ∂\u000e P ∂ t = K 1 N − K 2 \u000e P (6.22) Consider a small perturbation, \u000e P = \u000e P 0 + \u000e \u0005 .

Perkins (1973) pointed this out but went on to show that if, in addition to the equilibrium wind/electric field requirement, an eastward wind and/or northward electric field is present, the system is unstable. The full growth rate is (Hamza, 1999; Garcia et al., 2000b): γ = − E \u0005 e cos I BH + k e k 2 ⊥ cos I BH E \u0005 0 ⊥ · k ⊥ (6.24) where E \u0005 0 ⊥ = E + U × B and E \u0005 e is the eastward component. The real part of the frequency is ω r = k ⊥ · ( E 0 × B ) / B 2 (6.25) Note that the real part of ω only depends on E 0 , the electric field in the earth- fixed frame, not the wind vector. The phase velocity is simply the E × B velocity component parallel to k ⊥ . Expressions can be derived for pure electric field or pure wind-driven processes; following Garcia et al. (2000b), these are γ E = \u0014 k e k n k 2 ⊥ E e + \u0011 k 2 n k 2 ⊥ − 1 \u0012 E n \u0015 cos I BH (6.26a) γ W = \u0014 k e k n U e k 2 ⊥ + \u0011 k 2 n k 2 ⊥ − 1 \u0012 U s sin I \u0015 cos I H (6.26b) where subscripts e and n stand for east and north, respectively. The most unsta- ble k vector for case (6.26a) lies halfway between E ⊥ and the eastward direction (Perkins, 1973). For E n = E e this would be 22.5 ◦ north of east.

This direc- tionality is a major triumph of the Perkins theory, since the observed wave fronts do make an angle with the magnetic meridian. However, the growth rate is very slow and is unlikely to provide significant amplification of thermal noise. For the pure electric field case, the real part of ω is negative for the most unsta- ble wave vector, since k y E e > k x E N and the wave would seem to travel toward the southwest as observed (e.g., Fig. 6.23f). The problem with this seemingly positive result is that under typical conditions, both the background stability and instability are established by the winds, not the electric field. In fact, since the average electric field is southeastward after sunset, ω r is positive and wind- driven instability structures should drift toward the east, not the west. This is a major problem for the linear theory. Figure 6.28b shows that the TEC does vary in these events, so unlike, in the Perkins model, ∂ N /∂ t \u0013= 0. This is likely a three-dimensional effect. The first results of a three-dimensional simulation of this phenomenon show promise for new theoretical insights (Yokoyama et al., 2008). In the next section, a similar layer instability is discussed for the E region, and we take a new look at coupling between the layers. 6.7 Midlatitude E-Region Instabilities For many years extrapolation of equatorial instabilities to midlatitudes was thought to be trivial. Today we know this is far from the truth. One key difference is that electric fields share importance with neutral winds. Another is that the plasma gradients are sharper at midlatitudes than elsewhere due to the layering process discussed above. Even pure neutral atmospheric instabili- ties, such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz process, seem to play a role in creating plasma structures. 6.7.1 Radiowave Observations of Nighttime Midlatitude E-Region Instabilities Figure 6.30a illustrates a well-documented sporadic E event over Arecibo. As an intermediate layer descends from around 180 km, it is most likely supported against diffusion by a meridional wind shear in a tidal wave mode. As NO + and O + 2 decay away, a core of metallics maintains the layer and it steepens even more if subjected to a zonal wind shear. This mode change may have occurred at 2148 when the layer peak briefly began to rise. Quickly thereafter, as shown in Fig. 6.30b, the layer goes unstable to long-period variations in the Doppler shift, similar to equatorial large-scale waves, waves with λ much greater than the layer thickness.

Figure 6.30c shows a more spectacular event detected in the same geometry in which the spectra seem to saturate at close to the speed of sound. Schlegel and Haldoupis (1994) presented several examples of midlatitude Type 1 waves just like this case, one of which is reproduced in Fig. 6.31. They concluded that a modified two-stream condition existed. By “modified” they mean that the narrow two-stream spectra saturate at a relatively low velocity compared to the equatorial case. They concluded that this is most likely due to metallic ions and to the correspondingly lower acoustic speed.

As we shall see following, equatorial- like geometries may indeed occur at midlatitudes and lead to two-stream conditions. Many midlatitude events have been characterized as quasi-periodic or Q-P echoes. An example from the Gadanki radar in India is illustrated in Fig. 6.32. Typically, the echo slants downward in range as time goes by, as shown. Q-P echoes have been reported from many sites (Yamamoto et al., 1991, 1992; Huang et al., 1995; Chau and Woodman, 1999; Tsunoda et al., 1999). Due to the high aspect sensitivity of plasma scattering, the characteristic Q-P slants, which seem to be altitude dependent, may in fact be related to a change in range as such a blob moves into and out of the beam at a fixed height.

Various observations have implied that E s layers tend to organize into frontal structures with phase fronts aligned northwest to southeast (northeast to south- west) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. Sinno et al. (1965) analyzed time- delay measurements of Loran transmissions in the Northern Hemisphere and concluded that they could be explained by an organization of E s layer plasma into frontal structures with the orientation described. Goodwin and Summers (1970) came to a similar conclusion by analyzing data from a spaced ionosonde network in the Southern Hemisphere. Goodwin (1966) suggested that the fronts could be 1000 km long. Bowman (1989) modeled scintillations from E s layers in the Southern Hemisphere as opaque high-density strips arranged in a frontal structure, also with the alignment described.

Most of the changing types were found to be elongated structures that appeared to move horizontally without change of form in any 15-minute interval. The distribution of drift directions associated with “ridges” in 110 E s frontal structures are pre- sented in Fig. 6.33. The finding that drift azimuths were tightly clustered about the northwest and southeast directions is consistent with the passage of frontal structures. Similar results were obtained earlier by Clark (1965), whose results have been reproduced in Bowman (1985). More recent VHF observations from St. Croix have been made in conjunction with high-resolution incoherent scatter observations of the plasma density pro- files using the dual beam system (Hysell et al., 2004).

Interferometric data showed that the Q-P-like echoes came from near 105 km event, although the range versus time presentation could have been misinterpreted as a height change. The echoing peri- ods were collocated with patches of high density plasma at 105 km moving across the dual beam system. The horizontal interferometry (see Fig. 6.34) showed that the echoing regions were aligned from northwest to southeast. Finally, Urbina et al.

Both the two-stream and gradient drift instabilities have difficulties in this case. As discussed in Chapter 4, the condition under which primary two-stream waves occur is given by V D E 0 / B >( 1 + \u0011 0 ) C s (6.27) where \u0011 0 = ν i ν e /\u0003 i \u0003 e , C s is the acoustic speed, and E 0 is the dc electric field. The magnetic field increases quickly with latitude, while the midlatitude electric field is actually smaller than the field at the equator. Thus, (6.27) is difficult to satisfy and seems to preclude primary two-stream waves at midlatitudes. However, in the next section it is argued that if the layers are patchy horizontally, a two- stream instability can be driven by polarization of the patches. The problem with the classic electric field-driven gradient drift instability source is that the layers are not nicely perpendicular to the magnetic field.

Likewise, as shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 6.37b, a uniform zonal neutral wind is unstable where U × B is parallel to ∇ n . But in both cases, a layer is unstable on one side but stable on the other. At first glance this seems to preclude any instability at all when the growth rate is integrated over the layer, a fact that makes midlatitudes as interesting as they are. In the next sections we explore how additional complexities in the midlatitude ionosphere can be used to help explain midlatitude E-region radar echoes.

The perturbation charges and electric fields that characterize the electrostatic wave are also shown. The electric field-driven case is shown in (a) and the neutral wind-driven case in (b). In summary, the simple extension of equatorial instability theory to mid- latitude is not very satisfying. Applying global scale electric fields and horizontal winds to horizontally stratified layers cannot produce plasma structures with scale sizes larger than a few tens of meters (see Section 6.7.7) due to the mapping of the large scale wave electric fields along B to a stable region. 6.7.4 The Effect of a Wind Shear: The Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability as a Source of Q-P Echoes The wind shears discussed in Section 5.3.2 are often high enough to create a neutral atmospheric Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). This would result in periodic uplifts of the neutrals such as seen in Fig. 6.35a and in the plasma as well, since the ions are tightly controlled by the neutral gas (Larsen, 2000). One explanation for Q-P echoes involves just such a KHI process. The two rocket campaigns carried out in Japan to study these instabilities included TMA releases. Large shears were indeed seen during the events (Larsen et al., 1998, 2005). Bernhardt (2002) has simulated the KHI in the lower thermosphere and its effects on the plasma layers. Figure 6.38 shows KHI billows made visible by a TMA trail during the SEEK-2 project. When present the KHI must affect the plasma but it is not yet clear if they are the primary cause of the Q-P echoes. Figures 6.35a–c are a graphic example of the coupling of neutral and plasma fluids.

This causes a violent mixing of the fluid, and, as seen in the 50 MHz echoes presented in Fig. 6.35b, the plasma responds, even at small scales. Evidence for unstable shears—that is, shears with a Richardson number less than 1/4—were presented in Section 5.3.2 and seem to be very common in this height range. In such a process it is also common for periodic billows to form with separation scales several times the shear scale. In the case of the E region, the result would be separations in the range of 5–15 km of the radar echoes, which is typical of Q-P spacings (Larsen, 2000). Since the Kolmogorov microscale at 105 km is many tens of meters, it is not at all obvious how 3 m scales are created, which is needed to explain the radar scatter. A simple passive scalar-mixing argument will not produce structures at such small scales, nor will it produce structures with k strictly perpendicular to B . Some plasma process is required to allow coupling across the scales from tens of kilometers to meters. Such a process in polar mesospheric clouds involving charged ice particles is described in the next chapter. However, that mechanism is not likely to occur at middle latitudes, and, in any case, the scattering is much more isotropic in the polar summer mesosphere than was observed in sporadic E echoes. Several examples from Kane et al. (2001), including Fig. 6.35c, revealed 3 m echoes only on the top of the plasma layer. If the wind was strictly westward across the layer, only the topside would be unstable (see Section 6.7.7). Since the KHI seems very common in the midaltitude E region, neutral atom billows have been directly associated with VHF backscatter (see Fig. 6.35) and billow spacings are the right spacing; it seems the KHI plays a role in at least some Q-P echoes. 6.7.5 The Role of Horizontal Structure: Amplification by the Cowling Effect The occasional observation of Type 1 or two-stream instabilities is difficult to explain using global scale electric fields and horizontally stratified layers. For example, as in the equatorial case, a dynamo electric field drives a current across the magnetic field lines. Since the layers are very sharply bounded, one might think that they would polarize and the Cowling effect would occur. But since the magnetic field lines are oriented at an angle, any polarization field in the meridian plane will be shorted out along the magnetic field lines. Thus, there is no Cowling effect and no horizontal type 1 waves. Haldoupis et al. (1996, 1997) proposed that sharp plasma boundaries in the zonal direction could lead to large amplification of an applied meridional electric field. These horizontal structures have been observed over Arecibo by Smith and Miller (1980) and clearly are present in Fig. 6.7. In fact, during that E-region plasma and sodium- atom disturbance, type 1 echoes and large F-region drifts were observed (Swartz et al., 2002). The geometry for this process is presented in Fig. 6.39 for a south- ward electric field, the usual polarity for the evening to early morning hours. This direction electric field drives a westward Hall current through the sporadic"},{"pageNumber":334,"pageContent":"Waves and Instabilities at Midlatitudes 325 h 5 105 km \u0005 ≠ 0 \u0005 ≠ 0 \u0005 ≈ 0 \u0005 ≈ 0 I ≈ 50 8 E s -layer E s I x SN E y o E y o E x o E x p E x p B B 5 B 0 z ^ k radar J H 5 \u0005 H E y o J P 5 \u0005 P ( E x p 1 E x o ) x ^ x ^ y ^ y ^ z ^ z ^ WE Figure 6.39 Geometry for generating large polarization electric fields.

But if the layer is localized zonally by sharp boundaries and if no charge leaks off to the local F region and/or the conjugate E and F regions, a large east- ward polarization field will build up to keep ∇ · J = 0. Using their geometry and notation, the eastward polarization field is denoted by E P x and we have, E P x = σ H σ P E 0 y − E 0 x (6.28) where E 0 x is the eastward component and E 0 y is the southward component of the dynamo electric field. Since σ H /σ P can easily exceed a factor of 10, the polarization field can drive the two-stream instability. Similarly, a zonal wind ( u e ) will polarize a zonally localized patch with an electric field of value (σ H /σ P ) u e B , which then drives a meridional current that can be quite large. But in either case, one might wonder, why doesn’t the thin sporadic E layer polarize and stop the current? In fact, it does polarize but only in such a way as to stop the vertical component of the current. This is easy to do since the conductivity along B is very large."},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"326 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics The existence of metallic ions helps the generation of the two-stream waves in several ways: (1) they reduce the acoustic speed and thus the threshold drift; (2) their meteoric origin most likely leads to the patchy horizontal structures that polarize; and (3) they yield a higher σ H /σ P ratio than molecular ions (Haldoupis et al., 1997). Operating against all these positive features is the load the polar- ization electric field must maintain. Typically, \u000e F P >\u000e E P and the source must drive two F regions and the conjugate E region. This reduces E P x and most likely explains why the midlatitude two-stream instability is relatively rare. On the other hand, \u000e E H ∼ = neh / B , where h is the layer thickness, may be the appropriate internal conductance. For h = 5 km, n max = 10 5 cm − 2 , \u000e E H = 2 mho, which is sizeable. Before leaving this subject, we explore the general case including neutral winds and the possibility of polarization fields in both directions. In the plane perpen- dicular to B , the two-dimensional current vector in the coordinate system used by Haldoupis et al. (1997) is given by: J = \t σ P − σ H + σ H σ P \t E 0 x + E P x + u s B cos I E 0 y + E P y − u e B (6.29) where u s is the southward wind, u e is the eastward wind, and I is the dip angle.

Thus, to obtain the large electric fields, the patches must have one dimension much larger than the other. To summarize, the very existence of two-stream instabilities at midlatitudes seems to require patchy but elongated sporadic E layers, and these indeed have been observed. The driving mechanism is most likely to be large zonal neu- tral winds and wind shears. But when the large scale F-region structures occur, as discussed earlier in this chapter, large meridional electric fields exist, and the F-region contribution to the load is greatly reduced where the plasma is at high altitude (low airglow region). Both effects contribute to enhanced E-region instabilities. Furthermore, Swartz et al. (2002) and Kelley et al. (2003a) show examples in which F-region structures are highly correlated with strong E-region irregularities. Since electric fields map both directions it is not obvious which region is dominant when, as Swartz et al. (2002) found, the height-integrated conductivities are comparable in the two zones. Coupling between the E and F regions has been discussed for a long time, going back to Farley (1959). At midlatitudes, the nighttime F-region conductiv- ity exceeds that of the E region so it usually wins the electrodynamic battle. But Tsunoda and Cosgrove (2001), Haldoupis et al. (2003), Cosgrove and Tsun- oda (2004a, b), and Shalimov and Haldoupis (2005) have shown that E-region sources can affect the F region. At first, there was debate about the configuration of Fig. 6.39: Because the polarization electric field would drive a strong secondary Hall current down the length of the structure (southward), there appeared to be no way for this current to close. Hence, it appeared that a secondary polarization effect would quickly shut down the process, as indicated by (6.30c,d). However, Shalimov et al. (1998) showed that if the structures were narrow in the east-west direc- tion and extended in the north-south direction, then closure of the secondary Hall current could occur through the F region. This closure mechanism relied on the assumption that the zonal polarization electric field extended over a short enough spatial scale that it would not map effectively to the F region. Hysell and Burcham (2000) and Hysell et al. (2002) verified the Haldoupis et al. (1996) theory with the Shalimov et al. (1998) current closure path using simulations. Tsunoda (1998) showed that the geometry of Fig. 6.39 can be generalized and that the long direction of the plasma structure can have any alignment in the horizontal plane, as long as there is a component of the Hall current (from the background electric field or neutral wind) perpendicular to the long direction. Also, Cosgrove and Tsunoda (2001) showed that if the mechanism was driven by a sheared neutral wind, then closure of the secondary Hall current could occur through other E s patches, eliminating the need for long narrow structures and electrical contact with the F region. In fact, Cosgrove and Tsunoda (2002a) showed that, simply given the configuration of an E s layer located in a vertical wind shear (such as the one that supposedly formed the layer), generic alti- tude or field-line-integrated (FLI) density distortions create polarization electric"},{"pageNumber":337,"pageContent":"328 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics fields through essentially the mechanism of Haldoupis et al. (1996), with current closure occurring entirely within the E s layer. Given the large midlatitude wind shears found by Larsen (2002), relatively smooth altitude modulations of an E s layer can result in substantial polarization electric fields through this mechanism with more or less arbitrary orientations. Finally, although we have concentrated on the two-stream case in this section, the sizable polarization electric field and the existence of the zonally structured sporadic E patches suggest that the gradient drift process will occur even more often. Indeed, in Fig. 6.31, even during times when two-stream is not occurring, type-II echoes are evident. The spectra are a bit narrower than the equatorial case, which suggests that Sudan-like strong turbulence may be less common at midlatitudes (Haldoupis et al., 2003). 6.7.6 Spontaneous Structuring by the E s -Layer Instability As previously described, Perkins (1973) studied altitude modulations of the F layer and thereby discovered the Perkins instability. Armed with the theory of polarization of E s layers in a wind shear brought about by altitude (or field line-integrated (FLI) conductivity) modulation, Cosgrove and Tsunoda (2002b) undertook a similar study of the stability of E s layers. They found that the equilib- rium configuration of an E s layer at a zonal wind shear node is unstable at night to altitude and FLI density modulations. (During the day, polarization fields are heavily loaded by the highly conducting E region.) The unstable modulations are horizontally distributed as plane waves, and the growth rate maximizes when the plane wave phase fronts are aligned northwest to southeast (southwest to northeast) in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. Hence, this E s -layer insta- bility ( E s LI) is in the same class as the Perkins instability, since it shares a similar geometry. However, it differs from the Perkins instability in that it involves Hall currents and derives its free energy from a wind shear instead of gravitation. In addition, the compressibility of the E region leads to the coupling of FLI den- sity modulations to altitude modulations, which does not occur for the Perkins instability. Tsunoda et al. (2004) have summarized the experimental evidence for the E s LI, which can explain wavelengths from about 500 meters up to hundreds of kilo- meters. Hence, it applies to the longer wavelengths for which the gradient drift instability does not apply (Kelley and Gelinas, 2000; see Section 6.7.6). It also provides an alternative to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (see Section 6.7.2) as a way to create horizontal structuring of E s layers, which applies when the wind shear is hydrodynamically stable. Therefore, through the Haldoupis et al. (1996) polarization mechanism, it can also lead to large polarization electric fields, which are needed to explain the observations of type 1 and large-spread type 2 Doppler spectra. Simulations by Cosgrove and Tsunoda (2003) have shown the nonlinear evolution of the E s LI and demonstrated the generation of large"},{"pageNumber":338,"pageContent":"Waves and Instabilities at Midlatitudes 329 polarization electric fields, even when loaded by the F region.

Farley (1959) demon- strated that electric fields of sufficient spatial scale should map between the E and F regions due to the extremely high conductivity in the magnetic field-aligned direction, thus giving the beginning of a theoretical foundation for the observa- tions. Tsunoda and Cosgrove (2001) accounted for the Haldoupis et al. (1996) polarization mechanism and described a scenario for positive feedback between an E s layer and the F layer as a way to account for the relationship between E s - layer and F-layer structure. In companion papers, Haldoupis et al. (2003) and Kelley et al. (2003a) invoked the Haldoupis et al. (1996) polarization mechanism to explain new observations of E s -F-layer coupled behavior. Kelley et al. (2003a) noted that an eastward E-region perturbation electric field of sufficiently large scale would cause the F region to rise, reducing its conductivity and thus its load on the E region. All of this led up to a unified treatment of the F and E s layers and of the Perkins and E s -layer instabilities as a single coupled system (Cosgrove and Tsunoda, 2004a,b). Using the assumption that electric fields of sufficient spatial scale map unat- tenuated along B between the E and F regions, Cosgrove and Tsunoda (2004a) solved the equations of motion associated with the Perkins instability (see equa- tion 6.21b) together with the equations of motion associated with the E s LI to obtain the growth rate for the coupled E s -F-layer system. In general, they found two unstable modes. Under conditions in which a significant relative drift existed between the E s and F layers, one mode corresponded to the Perkins instability and the other corresponded to the E s -layer instability. However, when the rela- tive drift between the E s and F layers was small, there was only a single unstable mode, indicating a true coupling of the two instabilities. In this case they found that the overall system growth rate was normally more than doubled by the cou- pled electrodynamic effect. Of course, the implication is that the E-region neutral wind and the F-region E × B drift are equal, which would be rare. To treat the coupled condition when the wavelength is not long enough to assume 100% efficiency of the electric field mapping between the E and F regions and to obtain an approximate analytic expression for the coupled system growth rate, Cosgrove and Tsunoda (2004b) employ a circuit model approach similar to that given for the barium cloud in Fig. 6.19. Figure 6.41 shows the development of this circuit model, which is generally useful for the two-layer coupled problem, under the Farley (1960) mapping criteria.

For the highly coupled case ( R 0 = 0), which occurs for long wavelengths under conditions such that the relative velocity of the E s and F layers is zero, equation (6.31) gives the two growth rates: λ EFCL | R 0 = 0 = ⎧ ⎨ ⎩ = λ E s R F + λ F R E s R F + R E s 0 (6.33) Equation (6.33) shows only a single unstable mode for which the isolated growth rates combine according to the internal impedances of the E s - and F-layer sources, in the same way as the mapped polarization electric field. For the uncou- pled case ( R 0 = infinity), which occurs for short wavelengths, equation (6.31) gives the growth rates λ EFCL | R 0 →∞ = \u001c λ E s λ F (6.34) In this case there are two unstable modes: the growth rate of the Perkins instability, and the growth rate of the E s layer instability."},{"pageNumber":342,"pageContent":"Waves and Instabilities at Midlatitudes 333 6.7.8 The Wavelength Limiting Effect and Small-Scale Instabilities If a meridional electric field causes the instability or if the layer is subject to a zonal wind of only one sign, then only one side of a layer is unstable. When this occurs a very interesting phenomenon occurs. The outer scale of the instability is limited to waves which do not map to the other side of the layer where damping occurs. This is due to the Farley mapping effect. That is, if λ ⊥ (σ 0 /σ ρ ) 1 / 2 is greater than the layer thickness, the wave cannot exist. A very nice example of this effect is presented in Fig. 6.42. The wind was westward during the event and waves were found only on the top of the layer. Furthermore, the outer scale was 30 m, exactly as predicted by the mapping effect. This type of release of free energy in scales of 1 to 30 m may be the primary way that m-scales are created from plasma patches and billows. Urbina et al.

It seems quite likely that fluctuations in electron density associated with the electric fields presented in Fig. 6.42 are responsible for these VHF echoes and that a wind-driven instability could be the source. More importantly, perhaps, is the fact that the free energy release associated with the wavelength-limited process is manifested in fluctua- tions with an outer scale only an order of magnitude larger than the typical 3 m observing scale. Given the primary perturbation structures associated with any of the processes described above (e.g., KHI, E s layer, and drift instabilities), it is highly likely that patches with kilometer scales are present multiple places in a typical radar range gate/beam width area. Then fluctuation spectra similar to that in Fig. 6.31 will develop as secondary instabilities due to the mean wind or zero-order electric field on the unstable gradient side. The theory of the nonlocal gradient-drift instability, which is required when the density gradient cannot be treated as constant (e.g., E s layers), has been worked out by Rosado-Roman et al. (2004) and Seyler et al. (2004). The theory involves using a realistic vertical density profile and looking for solutions of the linearized equations of motion as sums of plane waves with wavevectors ranging over a two-dimensional plane. The resulting solutions are localized in the magnetic field direction and reside mainly on the side that would be unstable under ordinary local gradient-drift theory. This theory provides a formulation of the gradient drift instability that can be applied to E s layers. Such a theory is needed to explain the cascade of irregularity scales from the km-scale E s patches down to the few meter-scale irregularities that are detected by coherent scatter radars. Another instability, applicable to the midlatitude region, was discovered by Hysell (2002) while simulating polarization and the resulting evolution of E s patches coupled to the F region in a background electric field. The instability, which he refers to as a collisional drift instability, derives free energy from field- aligned currents through gradients in the parallel conductivity. The growth rate for the instability peaks for about one km wavelength waves, and thus may also be involved in the cascade of irregularity scales. 6.7.9 Wind-Driven Thermal Instabilities Finally we turn to a new idea proposed to explain what seem to be 3 m waves where no layer exists. Consider Fig. 6.43, which has echoes from a huge altitude range. Figure 6.44 illustrates the proposed thermal effect. A wind is assumed as well as an initial perturbation. In low-density regions the perturbation electric field causes Joule heating, since J and δ E are in the same direction. In regions of plasma enhancement the opposite effect occurs and no heating occurs. If the heating is great enough, the pressure force drives out more plasma and the depletion deepens—a plasma instability with no gradient needed (Kagan and"},{"pageNumber":344,"pageContent":"Waves and Instabilities at Midlatitudes 335 140 The SEEK experiment, August 20, 1996 Theory 120 100 − 100 0 A zonal wind \u0006 T \u0006 GD A meridional wind 100 00:00 01:00 0 10 20 Growth rate (s − 1 ) Local time (hour) Plasma density (cm − 3 ) Velocity (m/s) 30 10 4 10 5 10 6 Altitude (km) 80 (a) (b) (c) (d) 00:30 LT Figure 6.43 Comparison between experiment and theory for the data from the SEEK campaign: altitude profiles of winds (left-hand panel) measured by M.

This theory is compared with the experiment in Fig. 6.43. The thermal growth rate is plotted in the right-hand panel along with the wind-driven gradient drift growth rate. The thermal instability greatly increases the altitude range of the instabilities. Dimant and Sudan (1995) have proposed a similar thermal instability driven by strong auroral zone electric fields and Dimant and Oppenheim (2004) have revisited the Kagan and Kelley (2000) idea. One caveat is in order, however. At this time there is some debate over whether the altitudes listed in figures such as Fig. 6.43 are correct or whether, in fact, the signals are coming from the antenna sidelobes or are just due to the decreasing range of Q-P structures (see Section 6.7.1)."},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"336 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics References Behnke, R.

The transition between the mesosphere and the thermosphere is called the mesopause and is the altitude at which the temperature reaches a minimum before increasing with height in the thermosphere. The mesopause also delineates the boundary between the earth’s neutral atmo- sphere and the ionosphere. The latter is collocated with the thermosphere, which has temperatures ten times higher than those at the mesopause. The primary sub- ject in this chapter is the polar summer mesosphere which is by far the most interesting mesospheric region. The highest clouds on earth are found here, and the temperature often reaches values as low as 110 K with one measurement as low as 90 K. This is clearly the coldest place on earth. Most of this chapter is devoted to this region since it exhibits the very interesting electrodynamics and plasma physics associated with dusty or icy plasmas. We present a brief discussion of atmospheric electricity and upwardly propagating lightning and close with obser- vations and theory of mesospheric bore waves, both of which are of great scientific interest. 7.1 Noctilucent Clouds (NLC) and the Solstice Temperature Anomaly Interest in the polar summer mesosphere began on June 18, 1885, two years after Krakatoa’s eruption in 1883. A set of silvery-blue clouds was observed in the Northern Hemisphere under twilight conditions when the sun was below the horizon, but it was still illuminating the mesosphere—that is, just before dawn or just after sunset (Gadsden and Schröder, 1989). Using photographic triangulation, it was found that the height of these clouds was about 82 km—the highest clouds ever seen on earth. Due to their unusual nighttime brightness, they were named “noctilucent clouds” (NLC).

The ice particles were large enough to scatter sunlight and be seen by the naked eye. Excellent scientific and historical references are provided by Gadsden and Schröder (1989) and Schröder (2001). A less-well-known NLC event followed the great Tungiska event of 1908 when a comet or meteor struck Siberia. During the next two nights, the postsunset sky over England was bright enough to read a newspaper (Whipple, 1930). Recent studies of the aftermath of solstice launches of the space shuttle have been accompanied by brilliant NLC displays within a few days (Stevens et al., 2003, 2005). The associated injection of 300 meter tons of water vapor in the height range 100–115 km is clearly a sig- nificant perturbation but its transport to polar regions was remarkably rapid and must be related to the huge winds reported by Larsen (2002) described in Chapter 5. Equally curious is the rapid dispersal of the clouds, implying an anomalous horizontal diffusion, perhaps due to two-dimensional turbulence (Kelley et al., 2009). Kelley et al. (2009) connected these results with the Great Siberian Meteor Event of 1908 (Whipple, 1930) and concluded that the impact- ing object was a comet. These clouds are only observed during the summer months and usually present a wavy pattern, an effect that is attributed to their interaction with passing grav- ity waves. The ideal zone for viewing the scattered sunlight due to the largest ice particles is between 53 ◦ and 57 ◦ latitude because of the long twilight and the polar location of the clouds themselves. The photographic example presented in Fig. 7.1 displays some of the characteristics of noctilucent clouds. As will be seen, the charged component of the polar summer mesosphere allows radar Figure 7.1 Noctilucent clouds as observed at 2255 UT on July 19, 1997, from Glengarnork, Ayshire, Scotland.

Satellite instruments can detect the scattered photons in any lighting conditions, and thus the term polar mesospheric clouds (PMC) is a more general term for these clouds. An important related discovery was made during the International Geo- physical Year (IGY) of 1957–1958. Rocket grenades launched from many loca- tions and detonated at high altitudes revealed that, against all expectations, the temperature in the polar summer mesosphere is colder than the temperature in the winter polar zone (Nordberg et al., 1965). In fact, a temperature difference of about 100 K is found between summer and winter. More recent data are presented in Fig. 7.2, which not only reveal these temperature differences quite well but also show that the level of temperature fluctuation is higher in winter (Lübken and von Zahn, 1991). This result supports speculations that the NLC are composed of ice, which forms around dust particles (or large ions) at extremely low temperatures, even at the low water vapor pressure of the mesopause zone (1–2 parts per million). Gravity waves, which create the interesting visible structures in Fig. 7.1 and the wintertime variability in Fig. 7.2, are of more than passing importance to understanding the low temperature of the polar summer mesosphere.

In brief, if energy is to be conserved as an internal wave propagates upward, every time the background density decreases by a factor of 2, the wave velocity must increase by √ 2 or about 40%. In previous chapters we were most interested in those waves that survived breaking and/or viscosity to create observable ionospheric structure. We now investigate the wave breaking process, which can deposit energy and momentum in the mesosphere. 7.2 Gravity Wave Breaking Eventually most gravity waves will reach a height where their amplitude is so great that they break like water waves on a beach. A good rule of thumb is that a wave will break when its internal wave-induced velocity perturbation exceeds its phase propagation speed. Then the wave particles overtake the wave phase velocity and it steepens and breaks, as shown in Fig. 7.3 for a surface water wave approaching a beach. An example of the breaking of an internal wave is shown in Fig. 7.4. Here the velocity of a wave detected with the MU radar is plotted along with the predicted change of amplitude with height without breaking. At around 80 km the wave amplitude abruptly decays to values well below the linear prediction ( e z / 2 H ) curve. Wave breaking clearly has occurred. For a gravity wave, the breaking criterion that the perturbation velocity exceeds the wave phase velocity in the frame of the mean wind can be writ- ten as (Orlanski and Bryan, 1969), δ u /( c − u )> 1 (7.1) where δ u is the perturbation amplitude, c is the horizontal wave phase velocity component, and u is the component of the mean wind parallel to the wave vector.

The Brunt-Väisälä frequency, N , can be related to θ by N 2 = ( g /θ)( d θ/ dz ) (7.3) Following atmospheric science tradition, we use N for the Brunt-Väisälä fre- quency in this chapter rather than ω b . Recall that if N 2 is positive, a parcel of air will oscillate at the radian frequency N if it is displaced vertically by a distance of δ z from its equilibrium altitude, that is, the subsequent motion is described by the real part of z ( t ) = δ ze − iNt (7.4)"},{"pageNumber":357,"pageContent":"348 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics But if N 2 is negative the parcel does not return to its equilibrium position and the atmosphere is said to be convectively unstable. Taking the spatial derivative of (7.2) and ignoring the second derivative of the background potential temper- ature profile gives N 2 ( z ) = N 2 0 [ 1 − δ u c − u ] (7.5) where N 2 0 is the mean background Brunt-Väisälä frequency. Thus, condition is identical to the convective instability condition (7.1) for the region since for δ u >( c − u ) , N 2 ( z ) is negative. Panel b in Fig. 7.4 shows the wave-induced N 2 ( z ) for the event using (7.5) for both the actual data set and the extrapolated wave field using the e z / 2 H fac- tor. Clearly, N 2 was going to become negative at 80 km, the height where the wave broke. The fact that the measured N 2 did not actually become negative may be due to the fact that observations almost always occur in the fully non- linear regime. But another possibility is shown in panel c. Here the extrapolated Richardson number is plotted. It becomes less than 0.25 at 79 km, suggesting that a shear instability may have set in at a lower height than the convective instabil- ity. In any case, the wave clearly broke. The fact that its amplitude dipped to less than one-half of its value where breaking should occur is surprising. Theorists have speculated that the wave amplitude would stay at the amplitude where breaking occurs. But recent simulations (D. Fritts, personal communication, 2001) indicate that wave amplitudes drop well below this value due to rapid energy dissipation and then start to grow again with altitude before breaking again. 7.3 The Polar Summer Mesosphere: A Wave-Driven Refrigerator But what does this have to with the cold summer mesopause? When waves break on a beach or in the clear air they deposit their energy and momentum back into the local medium (swimmers in a rip current know this very well). The meso- sphere is so tenuous that the input of momentum from waves generated in the dense lower atmosphere is very significant. Current theories of the mesosphere argue that the waves that reach these heights come from preferred directions that are different in the two hemispheres. In the summer hemisphere the waves preferentially come from the west depositing a net eastward momentum into the medium. This spins the atmosphere up somewhat and it moves away from the pole. To conserve mass there is a net upflow at high latitudes resulting in adiabatic"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Mesosphere 349 Wave velocity Wind speed u max h 0 h Figure 7.5 Conditions for wave absorption by the jet stream. cooling, a wave-driven refrigeration process. The opposite effect occurs at the winter pole and the temperature rises. This preferential direction of momentum transfer could arise in a variety of ways and we only discuss one here, the so-called critical layer effect. Gravity waves are created by weather processes and it is no surprise that their phase velocities are small enough that jet stream winds are often larger than the wave propagation speeds. Suppose, then, that a wave propagates upward to a height where its velocity equals that of the background wind at, say, height h 0 in Fig. 7.5. In general, the Doppler-shifted frequency in the wind frame ( ω \u0004 )is given by ω \u0004 = ω − k · u (7.6) where ω , k , and u are measured in the earth frame. At h = h 0 , then, ω \u0004 = 0 and the wave is Doppler-shifted to zero. In this case the wave is not a wave at all, just some eddy in the flow, and it ceases to exist. In fact, only waves with horizontal velocities greater than u max get through the jet stream at all. Waves propagating in the other direction, against the flow, are Doppler-shifted upward and pass through easily. Eventually these waves will break at altitudes above the jet and deposit their momentum. Since the jet stream is to the west in the summer and to the east in the winter, gravity wave filtering thus can lead to the refrigeration mechanism just described above and to the observed temperature asymmetry. Modern global circulation models can only include such effects by param- eterizing momentum fluxes.

The polar summer hemisphere is indeed colder than the polar winter hemisphere by 100 K, as is observed. 7.4 New Observations of NLC and Related Phenomena New ways to study NLC have been developed in the latter part of the twentieth century. For example, in the early 1980s satellite measurements detected NLC, but due to the different method of detection, they were called Polar Mesospheric Clouds, or PMC (Thomas, 1991). They are believed to be the same as NLC with the only difference being that, from orbit, they could be observed for 24 hours and at a much less restrictive latitude range. Rocket observations of the electron density have been available as early as those of Pedersen et al. (1970), although such flights are fairly rare. Another observation method that is not hampered by lighting conditions takes advantages of the unexpectedly high radar cross section for VHF radars in the polar summer mesosphere.

Another way to monitor NLC involves lidar, a method analogous to radar but using light waves instead of radio waves (also see below). Finally, rocket instrumentation has been developed in the 1990s to detect dust and ice particles (Havnes et al., 1996; Gelinas et al., 1998). Figure 7.7 shows examples of simultaneous rocket and radar data taken in Alaska. The radar echoes in the left-hand panel were collocated with a burst of turbulent electron density structure while in the example on the right the echoes are collocated with a bite-out with electron density. It is important to point out that the sun is shining nearly 24 hours a day in this height range and that the mesosphere is a weakly ionized plasma. Thus, the deep plasma density depletion is unexpected since the solar ionization is a smooth source of plasma. The radar echoes are very strong in both cases for this height range—many orders of magnitude higher at VHF than detected elsewhere at this altitude. These early results suggested that more than one mechanism was responsible for the huge radar echoes (Kelley and Ulwick, 1988). STATE 1 is consistent with a turbulent-like process for the scatter (Fig. 7.7a) whereas STATE 3 is quite different (Fig. 7.7b) and may be due to very sharp edge effects called partial reflection.

These data argue for a model in which initially small particles, possibly nucleated by meteoric dust, grow by attaching water molecules, become charged (leading to the bite-outs), and eventually become snow-like aerosols that began to fall. They continue to fall and grow to be detected by the photometer until just below the mesopause where they sublime and disappear. (The electric field fluctuations in panel a are not yet understood but may indicate that either ambipolar fields or a dusty plasma instability is operating.) NLC are usually visible only at high latitudes, between 50 ◦ and 60 ◦ , but in June 22, 1999, they were observed in Boulder, Colorado ( 40 ◦ N ) . This is an indication that NLC are moving south, which could be due either to upper atmospheric cooling or increased water vapor caused by rising levels of CH 4 . Either case is related to human activity, a topic we take up later in this chapter."},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Mesosphere 353 7.5 Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes (PMSE) Early studies of VHF radar echoes from the high-latitude summer mesosphere and lower thermosphere using the Poker Flat MST radar in Alaska ( 65 ◦ N ) showed a relatively narrow and surprisingly intense echoing layer centered at about 86 km (Ecklund and Balsley, 1981). The echoes were characterized by their strong VHF (50 MHz) radar backscattering cross section, with backscattered powers 3–5 orders of magnitude greater than typical values observed at low or middle latitudes (in any season) or at high latitudes (in nonsummer periods). The echoes are now referred to as Polar Mesosphere Summer Echoes, or PMSE. PMSE are both intriguing and surprising, because the 3-m irregularities responsible for Bragg backscatter at 6 m radar wavelengths (i.e., the irregularities responsible for VHF backscattering) should lie within the viscous subrange of turbulence at 86 km, and as a consequence, should be strongly damped. As observed at VHF ( ∼ 50 MHz), northern-hemispheric PMSE exhibit the following characteristics: ● They comprise a thin but intense echoing region near and above the summer mesopause ( ∼ 85 km), with a typical thickness of 5 km. ● Although some relatively strong, albeit sporadic, echoes have been reported at latitudes as low as 52 ◦ , the strongest, most continuous echoes are observed at latitudes poleward of about 65 ◦ . ● The echoes appear around mid-May, last until mid-August, and are relatively continuous. ● Both the height range and seasonal variations of PMSE correlate reasonably well with those of the cold mesosphere. ● Joint observations using VHF radar and sounding rockets show that intense PMSE can be often associated with sharp “bite-outs” in the ambient electron density. ● The scatter is aspect sensitive, with the largest signals from the zenith. Subsequent to their discovery in 1981, many observations related to PMSE and NLC have been made using radar, lidar, and rockets. These observa- tions have helped formulate a number of theories proposed to explain the generation of the intense radar echoes and the remarkable physical condi- tions associated with them. Subfields in research as disparate as dusty (icy) plasma physics, interplanetary dust cloud studies, meteor ablation, and recoagu- lation science all have something in common with the polar summer mesopause region. Many mechanisms have been proposed as being responsible for, or at least partly responsible for, PMSE generation. An example showing 6 hours of radar echo data from this region is presented in Fig. 7.9. The downward echo progression is similar to that of the higher altitude ionospheric layers discussed"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"354 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Re s ol u te ba y VHF r a d a r 6:00 7:00 8 :00 9:00 10:00 11:00 12:00 D a y: 1 8 -J u n-9 8 (169) 8 0 8 2 8 4 8 6 88 90 Height (km) dB 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 3 Figure 7.9 Contour plot of the signal-to-noise ratio at Resolute Bay, Canada (75 ◦ N, 95 ◦ W).

(The radar frequency is 51.5 MHz corresponding to backscatter from structures of 2.91 m wavelength, which is smaller than the Kolmogorov microscale in the mesosphere.) Radiowaves scatter most easily from electrons and, when they are present, usually dominate the radiowave physics. Indeed, since the summer polar zone is in full sunlight, the ionosphere actually extends downward to the altitudes of these echoes. But this is true at other latitudes in daytime, so simply having electrons present in a turbulent atmosphere (the mesopause is below the tur- bopause) is not sufficient to yield these huge echoes. Rayleigh scatter is not a viable explanation. The rocket data in Fig. 7.7 that show the electron density structure in the medium provided the first clear indication that the echoes were related to the coupling of electrons and small particles (Kelley et al., 1987; Kelley and Ulwick, 1988). Figure 7.10 shows simultaneous VHF scatter echo profile and the electron density during a strong radar event. A severe, sharp, bite-out in the latter is coincident with the echoing region. It seems curious that removing electrons can increase the signal, but if the resulting coupled electron-ice gas has very sharp edges or small eddies, the crucial requirement that structure at half the radar wavelength exists may be accomplished. Analysis of the rocket data indeed shows that for this VHF (53.5 MHz) study the electron gas was indeed structured at this small scale. Wavelets have been used to probe the sharp edges in the data set to see if they are steep enough to partially reflect VHF radar signals. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 7.11, the Canny edge detector wavelets are strong deep into the meter range responsible for edge scatter (Alcala and Kelley, 2001; Alcala et al., 2001).

Both turbulent and edge scatter thus seem to occur, with the former dominating. The complementary roles of active turbulence and sharp edges in PMSE are upheld by Figs. 7.10 and 7.11. Figure 7.12 indicates that a third mechanism plays a role. These data are the first simultaneous measurements of radar echoes, electron density, and neutral density fluctuations (Lübken et al., 1993). The three phenomena clearly are not collocated, suggesting that turbulence in the passive scalar electrons may outlive the active neutral turbulence that created it. This fossil turbulence idea has been quantitatively verified by Rapp and Lübken (2004a, b).

Usually S c ≈ 1 and in the turbulence case the passive scalar electrons have the same spectrum as the neutral gas with an inner scale of tens of m in the mesosphere. Batchelor (1959) showed that a passive scalar (plasma in this case) can have structure at scales much smaller than the neutral gas if S c is large. Figure 7.13 shows a comparison of the electron fluctuation spectra measured using rocket probes at three locations. The equatorial and nonpo- lar summer cases show the usual neutral turbulence-like inner scale (tens of meters) but the polar summer spectrum extends well into the submeter scale sizes. Some 5–7 orders of magnitude of higher spectral density are found at VHF Bragg scales, which directly translate into 50–70 db of increased radar echo strength. A high Schmidt number is caused by a low diffusion coefficient, which in turn is caused by heavy charged aerosols. An analogy by J. Cho likens electrons to flies buzzing around individual cows slowly lumbering around a field. Once the heavy aerosols tie up around half the charge, D A drops dramatically (Cho et al., 1992a).

Schmidt numbers well over 1000 have been indicated (Nicolls et al., 2008). Turning to edge scatter, it is clear that a high S c also allows sharp gradients to exist but, unlike the turbulence theory by Batchelor (1959), we as yet have no explanation of the sharp edge phenomenon. The wavelet analysis of rocket data taken during PMSE (shown in Fig. 7.11) illustrates just how sharp these edges can be. The scalogram clearly shows that submeter scale components exist on the edges, and a quantitative analysis shows that VHF scattering can be explained (Alcala et al., 2001). This type of scatter clearly leads to aspect sensitivity, since, for a radar beam off vertical, the specular-like scatter would not yield a return signal. Aspect sensitivity can also occur if the turbulence is itself anisotropic (Bolgiano, 1968). Since the sharp edges on the rocket data are somewhat rare, it is likely that most aspect sensitivity is due to anisotropy in the turbulent structures. Recently, a UHF radar was installed near Fairbanks, Alaska (Poker Flat Inco- herent Scatter Radar). Figure 7.14a shows an example of ice-related echoes at a Bragg wavelength of 33 cm near 82 km. These echoes were obtained at night, implying that auroral particle precipitation produced the plasma necessary to charge the particles.

Finally, another idea has arisen (Havnes et al., 1990; Hagfors, 1992; La Hoz, 1992) to explain scatter at even higher frequencies that has been observed in the polar mesosphere—for example, at 933 MHz (Röttger et al., 1990) and at 1290 MHz (Cho et al., 1992b). The idea is that an ice particle with charge state ± Z will attract a cloud of equal and opposite sign within a few Debye lengths of the particle. If the radar wavelength is larger than the cloud, the signal scattered by it is proportional to Z 2 , thus enhancing the incoherent scatter component of the return echo (La Hoz et al., 2006). Radar echoes are thought to be associated with small particles, while the vis- ible NLC are due to those larger ones ( r ≈ 30 nm ) capable of forward scat- tering of visible light (λ ≈ 500 nm ) . The simultaneous radar and lidar data in Fig. 7.14b support this idea. Notice that the lidar (which detects the largest ice particles) signal is at the lower edge of the radar signal. This seems a clear indication that the radar detects small particles as they fall and grow larger to be detected by the lidar just before they begin to sublimate as the temperature rises."},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"100 95 90 85 1 ( 2 1.8 8 az, 79.6 8 el) 3 (14.0 8 az, 90.0 8 el) Zoomed 80 75 70 65 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 90 88 86 84 82 80 78 76 17:25 17:35 Time (UT) 17:45 17:55 18:05 18:15 Altitude (km) 2 ( 2 88.8 8 az, 80.7 8 el) 100 95 90 85 Altitude (km) 80 75 70 65 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Time (UT) 3 (14.0 8 az, 90.0 8 el) 19 100 95 85 90 80 75 70 65 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 5 ( 2 165.0 8 az, 85.0 8 el) 100 95 90 85 Altitude (km) 80 75 70 65 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 Time (UT) Log 10 Reflectivity (m 2 1 ) 2 18.0 2 17.8 2 17.6 2 17.4 2 17.2 2 17.0 2 16.8 2 16.6 2 16.4 2 16.2 2 16.0 100 95 90 85 80 75 70 65 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Time (UT) 19 4 (96.4 8 az, 83.9 8 el) Figure 7.14a Reflectivity measured in five look directions by PFISR for the night of August 10–11, 2007.

Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] 7.6 The Role of Charged Ice In Appendix A, a discussion of Langmuir probes describes how an isolated metal sphere charges negatively in a plasma. The higher thermal velocity of the elec- trons leads to a high flux and negative voltage results, which repel most of the electrons until the positive and negative currents match. The absolute value of this voltage is a few times k B T e / e , the electron temperature in electron volts. Charged mesospheric ice particles behave similarly except they are so small that only a small charge can be accommodated. For mesospheric temperatures, a metallic sphere would have to have a diameter as large as 30 nm to accommo- date even one electron on average. The particles are far from spherical, however, and it is thought that even smaller particles can hold an electron but in any case, the number of electrons that can be accommodated is small. This simple idea provides some insight but not a quantitative model dealing with how ice charges. Reid (1990) has explored this problem in some detail. His results are summarized in Figs. 7.15a and b. In the former, a variety of species number densities are accounted for during daytime conditions for a par- ticle radius of 1 and 10 nm. The balance equations have been solved for various ionization rates. Reid (1990) quotes 10 cm − 3 s − 1 as a typical ionization rate for daytime mesospheric heights. In both cases he finds significant electron deple- tions. Charged dust thus can cause an electron bite-out as observed (Pedersen et al., 1970; Ulwick et al., 1988). The scenario suggested by Reid (1997) is that charged nanometer-sized dust or molecular ions nucleate ice formation in the 90 km height range. As the dust/ice particles grow they begin to fall, growing ever larger, becoming the 10 nm particles in Fig. 7.15b. As the temperature rises below 85 km, the particles begin to sublimate and all but the dust disappears.

The charged particles enhance radar scattering, leading to PMSE. But what is the origin of these small particles? Reid (1990) used the calculations of meteoric dust or smoke particles supplied by Hunten et al. (1980), which is reproduced in Fig. 7.16. Here the dust concentration is plotted versus particle radius at 90 km. This was determined using meteor impact and recoagulation theory as originally suggested by Rosinski and Snow (1961).

This is a very exciting new area of radar research! 7.7 On the Possible Relationship Between PMSE, NLC, and Atmospheric Change As time has passed, more observations of NLC have been reported and an increas- ing trend has been detected (see Fig. 7.17). This change in NLC may be due to the observed increment in atmospheric methane and carbon dioxide due to human activity. A doubling increment in any of these components will produce a cool- ing of the thermosphere and mesosphere by about 50 K and 10 K, respectively (Roble and Dickinson, 1989). Remember that cold temperatures are necessary conditions for NLC generation, but not the only one: water is also needed. About half of the mesospheric water vapor is believed to come from the photodissocia- tion and oxidation of upwardly transported methane with the chemically active hydroxal radical (OH). Colder temperatures and more water vapor can produce more NLC events, so they can be used as indicators of changes in the atmosphere. The necessary conditions for the occurrence of PMSE and NLC (or PMC) appear to be similar: they require low temperatures and are apparently related to water vapor (Gadsden and Schröder, 1989). The seasonal PMSE occurrence corresponds well with the high-latitude seasonal occurrence of NLC. Recent studies have shown a correlation of PMC with PMSE in the Northern Hemisphere where the mean long-term PMC occurrence ratio curve fits symmet- rically inside the PMSE occurrence ratio. A close correlation between NLC and PMSE has also been observed using lidar and radar data (von Zahn and Bremer, 1999), respectively. These studies were made using a common volume and they"},{"pageNumber":372,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Mesosphere 363 60 40 Number of nights 20 0 1970 1980 Year Slope 1 night/year 1990 Figure 7.17 Observations of NLC over nearly three decades.

Thus, PMSE are of particular interest in view of their frequent coincident occurrence with NLC and the possible association of recent increased detection of NLC with global warming trends (Gadsden, 1990). If we could monitor PMSE for long periods of time and observe increases/decreases in these events (and their relative strength) over time, we could use such infor- mation as a possible indicator of atmospheric change. In fact, these clouds have been called the miner’s canary of Global Change (Thomas, 1996a, b). Unfortu- nately, the injection of water vapor by the space shuttle in the last twenty years may distort this development. 7.8 Upward-Propagating Lightning The earth is a good electrical conductor compared to the atmosphere and effec- tively forms a “ground” potential. Thunderstorms charge the earth negatively, which then discharges through the weakly conducting atmosphere. Thus, the system can be modeled as a leaky spherical capacitor. About 250,000 V exist between the earth and the lower ionosphere. The average current density over the earth is about one pA/m 2 and the total is about 1500 A. Ninety-nine percent of the time, lightning striking the ground brings negative charge, which is how the earth becomes charged. Every such flash consists of several strikes following the same channel. Each such current pulse creates an electromagnetic wave similar to that of a dipole antenna. The fields have electro- static, inductive, and radiation characteristics. Although the electrostatic field is largest in the near field and right over the strike, all three field types are important at the base of the ionosphere."},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"364 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Figure 7.18 shows the variety of mesospheric phenomena that can accompany cloud-to-ground lightning (CG). The most well studied of these phenomena are the so-called “sprites” and “elves.” “Blue jets” and “gigantic jets” have recently come to the forefront, since gigantic jets appear to provide an electrical connec- tion between cloud tops and the ionosphere. Few observations of gigantic jets have been made thus far, however, and all known gigantic jets have occurred above oceanic storms (Pasko et al., 1997, 2002; Su et al., 2003). Elves are expand- ing rings of luminosity that are directly linked to a causative electromagnetic pulse (EMP) emanating in a dipole pattern from the cloud-to-ground lightning. When the EMP encounters the base of the ionosphere (at around 80 km alti- tude), it heats the ionospheric electrons, and optical emissions are produced. Elves have been observed with large lightning discharges of either positive or negative polarity (Inan et al., 1991; Fukunishi et al., 1996; Barrington-Leigh et al., 2001). Sprites occur between thundercloud tops and the base of the ionosphere and are the optical manifestation of upper atmospheric electrical breakdown caused by cloud-to-ground lightning. They are almost always associated with the more rare strong positive polarity lightning strikes and generally are thought to be due to a quasistatic electric field set up above a thundercloud after charge is deposited to ground by a positive CG strike (Pasko et al., 1997, 2002).

Initially the thundercloud is effectively a vertical dipole with positive charge on top and negative charge on the bottom. The ions and electrons in the overlying mesosphere and lower ionosphere are distributed so as to cancel the electric field created by the thundercloud dipole. When a + CG occurs and positive charge is removed from the cloud, a subsequent breakdown, or sprite, can occur above the thundercloud. Following the sprite, the electrons and ions rearrange to once again reduce the electric field existing above the cloud. Observations using telescopic imagery have shown that the lower portions of sprites consist of filamentary structures that are thought to be streamer discharges (Fig. 7.20; Gerken et al., 2000).

Four rockets were launched by Cornell University over thunder- storms from Wallops Island (Kelley et al., 1990; Siefring and Kelley, 1991; Baker et al., 1996; Kelley et al., 1997). One of the most intriguing, and as yet not understood, features observed in these launches is a parallel electric field accom- panying each strike. An example of electric fields observed in the ionosphere at 294 km altitude is shown in Fig. 7.21. The field strength is as high as 50 mV/m, but it is a far cry from the 5 V/m seen the same distance away along the ground in the earth-ionosphere waveguide (Kelley and Barnum, 2009; Vlasov and Kelley, 2009). The dissipated energy heats the mesospheric electrons. On one occasion, keV electrons were detected over a thunderstorm-rich hurricane with an associ- ated electric field burst (Burke et al., 1992). The parallel electric field component observed by the rockets rides on the leading edge of the wave front, which trav- els at nearly the speed of light. These parallel fields may be associated with an ac conductivity, σ ac = j ωε , associated with the leading edge.

There was a sharp front approaching from the northwest which, in the 5577 emission (at 96 km), brought with it a sharp decline in the airglow intensity, whereas in the OH emission (at 87 km), it brought a sharp increase in"},{"pageNumber":377,"pageContent":"368 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics the intensity. In both emissions, a series of waves followed in the wake of the front. The waves themselves were 180 ◦ out of phase between the two emissions. The feature eventually covered the entire sky, from horizon to horizon in every direction. As many as 10 crests can be identified. Very similar events have been reported subsequently (Garcia, 1999), one of which was visible to the naked eye in the OH emission (Smith et al., 2003). These features have been called sharp fronts, wall waves, and mesospheric bore waves. The former two designators refer to a guided nonlinear step or solitary wave. The theory is best developed for mesospheric bores and will be emphasized here. 7.9.2 Analogy to a Hydraulic Jump A bore, or hydraulic jump, in an open channel is an abrupt change in the depth of the channel fluid in response to a transition from supercritical to subcritical flow and is analogous to the shock that forms in a gas in the transition from supersonic to subsonic flow. Dewan and Picard (1998) observed that the airglow image data of the sharp front in the Aloha campaign showed remarkable similarities to river channel bores, an example of which is shown in Fig. 7.23. They have advanced a theory to try to attribute the sharp fronts to “mesospheric bores.” Bores in an open channel have been well studied. Lighthill (1979) provides a good description of open channel bore theory. The problem in relating atmo- spheric bores to open channel bores is that there is no channel in the atmosphere, so what is the guiding mechanism? Dewan and Picard (1998) cite examples (e.g., see Smith, 1988) of bores in the troposphere to show that internal bores Figure 7.23 A tidal bore on the River Mersey from the air (Dewan and Picard, 1998) from (Tricker, 1965).

The channels in these cases are hypothesized to be layers of stable air surrounded immediately above and below by less stable layers. Layers of temperature inversion could provide for such a situation. In explaining the Aloha front, they believe there must have existed a horizontal waveguiding chan- nel between the two layers (say, around 90–94 km) in which a bore propagated. As the bore theoretically passed overhead, it produced symmetrical oscillations about the center of the channel. The upper layer (5577) was pushed higher, mak- ing it cooler, less dense, and presumably less bright. The lower layer (OH) was pushed symmetrically lower, making it warmer, more dense, and brighter. Dewan and Picard use the very simplified density profile depicted in Fig. 7.24, which they claim is the simplest guiding structure that can support an internal bore. The ρ 1 and ρ 3 layers are assumed to be semi-infinite in extent. The ρ 3 layer is of finite thickness 2 h 0 . They argue that any oscillation on the ρ 3 − ρ 2 surface will be mirrored in the ρ 3 − ρ 1 surface about the plane of symmetry S , where there is no vertical motion. Thus, S acts as if it were the rigid bottom of an open channel bore. Dewan and Picard state that the equations governing open channel bores will hold for this simple model if the acceleration due to gravity, g , is replaced by the buoyant acceleration g \u0004 defined as g \u0004 = ρ 2 − ρ 3 ρ 2 g Figure 7.24 is equivalent to a Brunt-Väisälä profile with a step. 7.9.3 Nonlinear Simulation of Mesospheric Bores Seyler’s (2005) two-dimensional nonlinear model for the mesosphere depends on the following parameters: N 0 , N 1 , h , L x , L z , and A .

Table 7.1 provides a summary for 8 of the numerical simulations investigated. All of the runs listed in the table form bores, although in run 8, a single peak was formed and, strictly speaking, this should be considered a solitary wave. The wavelength λ x was determined approximately 3 4 of the way through the runs and the phase speed was averaged over the last half of the runs. The initial wavelength at the time of peak formation is considerably smaller. Figure 7.25a is a set of contour plots of the stream function given at four uni- formly spaced times for run 1. In the upper left panel at time 200, the distortion of the initial “ducted” gravity wave is evident. At time 400, shown in the upper right panel, three peaks have formed.

This implies a positive potential temperature pertur- bation above and a negative perturbation below the center line. The streamline contours before the vertical boundaries have begun to fall off exponentially so that the effect of the periodic boundary conditions is negligible. The structure of the bore flow and potential temperature fields in the Seyler model is consistent with that proposed by Dewan and Picard (1998). Bores have only odd symmetry (i.e., area varicose mode) in the flow field. This corresponds to the odd-node number eigenmodes. Even eigenmode bores have not been found in these numerical solutions. This is expected because the nonlinear steepening process resulting from flow advection of the potential temperature is not significant for even parity solutions. A property found in the simulations that differs from that assumed by Dewan and Picard (1998) is the constancy of the wavelength, or, perhaps more properly, the separation between crests. Seyler finds that the wavelength decreases from the front to the back of the bore. The variation in peak separation can be large, as in runs 5 and 7 or considerably smaller, as in runs 1, 2, 3, and 4, and depends significantly on the time at which the separation is measured. The linear bore phase speed is close to that predicted by linear theory—namely, c =− 2 hN 0 π ( 1 − 4 π 2 | k | h ) For example, using k = 2 π/ 18 ≈ 0 . 35 in run 1, the linear model phase speed is c = 0 . 55. This is very close to the simulation value for the bore speed, which is 0.54."},{"pageNumber":382,"pageContent":"Dynamics and Electrodynamics of the Mesosphere 373 In order to compare these results with observations, we need to revert to physical space and time units need to be introduced. To set the characteristic spatial and time scales, let the layer thickness be 1.5 km and the peak Brunt period, in inverse radians, is 25 s using data from Garcia (1999). From Table 7.1, corresponding to run 1, the wavelength of the longest undulation is 1 . 5km × 18 = 27 km. The bore formation time is 25 s × 300 ≈ 2 h . The phase speed is c = 0 . 54 × N 0 h ≈ 32 m/s. These values are typical of what is observed for mesospheric bores. It is important to note that the bore formation process considered by Seyler (2005) differs from that in Dewan and Picard (2001) who consider the bore for- mation results from steepening of a “hydraulic jump” created by an accelerating piston, whereas Seyler only considered ducted gravity wave initial conditions. Nonetheless, the analysis and numerical solutions presented by Seyler show that mesospheric bores are consistent with nonlinear internal gravity waves trapped within a thermal inversion layer, as proposed by Dewan and Picard (1998). The nonlinear solutions are consistent with observations of mesospheric bores with respect to propagation speed, wavelength, number of peaks, and formation time. The nonlinear model predicts additional properties of mesospheric bores that are potentially testable but have yet to be observed, such as the vertical structure of the flow and potential temperature field.

Since the magnetic field is nearly vertical, this corresponds to the horizontal motion of plasma. At the large scales (> 100 km ) considered here, the electric force in (2.36b) dominates the pressure gradient and gravitational forces so only an imposed electric field and a neutral wind need be considered in the perpendicular plasma motion. In order to understand the characteristics and the sources of the imposed electric field, we first deal briefly with the relationships between electric fields and currents that exist in the ionosphere, outer magnetosphere, and solar wind. These fields and currents are coupled along the earth’s magnetic field. Following this, we discuss the observed characteristics of electric fields and currents in the ionosphere and their relationships to the magnetic field topology throughout the ionosphere, the magnetosphere, and the solar wind system. 8.1 Electrical Coupling Between the Ionosphere, Magnetosphere, and Solar Wind 8.1.1 General Relationships We begin by considering two regions: one in the ionosphere and one in the magnetosphere. Below about 200 km the ionosphere is a resistive medium, and in Chapter 2 we showed that the electric field E and electric current J are related by the equation J = σ · ( E + U × B ) (8.1) where σ is the ionospheric conductivity tensor and U and B are the neutral wind velocity and magnetic field, respectively. In that chapter we also pointed out that above about 2000 km, the magnetospheric plasma is essentially collisionless and the equations governing E , J , and the plasma velocity V are E + V × B = 0 (8.2) The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Copyright © 2009 by Academic Press, Inc.

Electrical coupling between the regions is described by the equation for current continuity ∇· J = 0 (8.5) and Faraday’s law ∇ × E + ∂ B /∂ t = 0 (8.6) which must apply throughout the system. The boundaries of these regions can be defined rather loosely for our purposes, since only a qualitative treatment of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is being undertaken. The region between 200 and 2000 km is a transition zone, but for most purposes the plasma motion there is also given by (8.2). Throughout this chapter we assume that the magnetic field lines connecting these regions are electric equipotentials. This assumption breaks down drastically in the lower magnetosphere on auroral zone field lines where electrons and ions are accelerated by parallel electric fields. This source region for auroral arcs is discussed in Chapter 9. The space above 2000 km can be divided into two topologically different regions by the magnetic field geometry described in Chapter 1 (see Fig. 1.13). At the highest latitudes, the magnetic field lines extend either to the magne- topause and subsequently into the magnetosheath and solar wind, or far down the magnetotail into the boundary layer that lies just inside the magnetopause. Field lines extending to the magnetosheath are “open”—that is, they have one foot on the earth and the other connected to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Field lines extending to the boundary layer and inner magnetosphere are “closed”—that is, they have both feet on the earth even though the field line may be extremely long. In the magnetosheath and in the boundary layer, the plasma is flowing rapidly antisunward and is driven by the expanding solar atmosphere. In the inner magnetosphere the plasma flow is dependent on the plasma pressure and upon both internally and externally applied electric fields."},{"pageNumber":390,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 381 8.1.2 A Qualitative Description of Convection for Southward IMF Some fundamental properties of the coupling of electric fields, currents, and energy in the ionosphere, magnetosphere, and solar wind system can be under- stood as follows. Consider the case where magnetic field lines in the ionosphere connect to a southward IMF. This defines an area at high latitudes in the iono- sphere called the polar cap. The geometry is shown schematically in Fig. 8.1a. This interaction is described qualitatively in Chapter 1, which the reader is encouraged to revisit at this time. Since the solar wind plasma is collisionless and expands radially outward from the sun, the electric field in the solar wind vanishes, while in the earth’s frame it is given by E sw =− V sw × B sw . For a southward IMF the field will have a component pointing from dawn to dusk. The electric potential across the connected field lines will be applied across the magnetosphere and will map down to the polar cap ionosphere, where a dawn- to-dusk directed ionospheric electric field, E I , will also result. This electric field drives the ionospheric F-region plasma in the antisunward direction at a speed V I = E I × B I / B 2 I . The magnetic flux density is higher in the ionosphere than in the solar wind and, since the equipotential surfaces converge, the electric field in the ionosphere will be larger than in the solar wind. Typical numbers are B I / B sw = 50 , 000 nT / 5nT = 10 4 E I / E sw = 50 mV m − 1 / 2mVm − 1 = 125 V I / V sw = 1kms − 1 / 400 km s − 1 = 2 . 5 × 10 − 3 Returning to (8.1) and ignoring the neutral wind in the ionosphere for the present, the electric field will drive a current at ionospheric heights given by J = σ · E I (8.7) The Pedersen component of this ionospheric current is parallel to E I and so is such that J · E > 0. In this interaction, then, the ionosphere is a load and we must ascertain where the electrical energy originates. Referring to Fig. 8.1a, suppose that the solar wind slows down slightly when it is in contact with the region shown and that we can ignore the gravity and pressure gradients. Then (8.4) shows that J ⊥ = (ρ/ B 2 ) B × d V / dt is antiparallel to E sw —that is, J sw · E sw < 0. The solar wind acts as an MHD generator, feeding energy to the ionosphere as a load. Note that in this region the J × B force is directed back toward the sun, which shows consistency with the concept that the solar wind is slowing down due to the interaction. These same principles hold in any electromotive generator in which kinetic energy is converted to electrical energy. Finally, since the interaction region where the solar wind slows down is bounded, J sw has a divergence which provides the field-aligned currents feeding the load."},{"pageNumber":391,"pageContent":"382 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics B PC E PC V J II V SW V A E SW J II L z L x B SW B SW J SW L y Dawn Dusk Figure 8.1a Schematic representation of the magnetic connection between the solar wind dynamo and the ionospheric load. Note that J × B in the solar wind is toward the sun. Our goal here is to make a simplified but interesting estimate of the percentage change of the solar wind velocity as it streams by the earth. We argue that what controls this slowdown in part is the conductivity of the polar cap ionospheres. This is characterized by the magnetic field line-integrated Pedersen conductivity, \u0004 P , which is the electrical load on the MHD generator. The total current enclosed in the polar cap is I pc = \u0004 P L pc E pc , where L pc is the size of the polar cap and E pc is the dawn-to-dusk component of the polar cap electric field. Since \u0004 P can be very different in the two hemispheres at solstice, we treat each polar cap separately. I pc must be closed in the solar wind. Its value is given by the expression I sw = J sw L T L z , where L T is the distance the field line moves before it reconnects in the magnetotail and L z is the distance along the IMF in which an Alfvén wave travels in this time. For a “square” polar cap we have L z = V A δ t , where δ t = ( L pc B pc )/ E pc , since the polar cap velocity is E pc / B pc . Likewise, L T = V sw δ t . By Kirchoff’s current law, I pc = I sw and thus, J sw = \u0004 P L pc E pc L T L z . (8.8) The current density can also be expressed as J sw = ( ρ/ B sw ) dV sw dt . (8.9)"},{"pageNumber":392,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 383 Equating Eqs. (8.8) and (8.9) yields \u0004 P L pc E pc = ρ B sw δ V sw δ t ( V A δ t )( V sw δ t ) . We should note that by letting dt in the time derivative equal δ t , we are assum- ing the slowdown occurs at a large spatial scale. Now, using V A = √ B 2 sw /μ 0 ρ and letting η A = μ 0 V A be the intrinsic impedance of a magnetized plasma at low frequencies, we can write δ V sw V sw = \u0004 P η A ( E 2 pc B pc B sw E 2 sw ) . However, if magnetic field lines are equipotentials, then E 2 / B is a constant anywhere along the field line, since E ∝ \u0007/δ l and B ∝ 1 /δ l 2 , where \u0007 is the constant potential and δ l is the distance between two field lines. Thus, the term in brackets goes to 1 and we get δ V sw V sw = \u0004 P η A . (8.10a) This simple yet elegant result demonstrates how a planetary magneto- spheric/ionospheric system interacts with a stellar wind and the controlling influ- ence of the polar cap conductivity. For the summer polar cap, \u0004 P = 5 \b − 1 and, taking η A = 0 . 1 \b , we find a 50% slowdown. This equation implies that the winter polar cap electric field should be larger than the summer field. This impli- cation is suggested by data such as that in Fig. 8.1b in which the polar cap in winter exceeds the summer value in agreement with Eq. (8.10a). More sophisticated studies by Siscoe et al.

J. Nicolls.) for simplicity’s sake). In the preceding equation, E sw is expressed in mV/m, P sw in nPa, \u0004 P in S, and \u0007 pc in kV. As in the simple conceptual approach above, the polar cap ionospheric electric field (proportional to \u0007 pc ) can be inversely proportional to \u0004 P . This holds true whenever E sw or \u0004 P is large enough to cause a saturation of the polar cap potential, limiting it to values of the order of 250 kV (Hairston et al., 2003). Weimer (see Appendix B) has developed a climatological model of the cross polar cap potential based on DMSP data. Inputs involve solar wind parame- ters. In Fig. 8.1c, the Hill-Siscoe equation (8.10b) is compared to the Weimer model using TIMEGCM to determine \u0004 p (Weimer, 2001). The agreement is remarkable except when B z is almost exactly northward. For the high solar wind velocity and pressure in this event during B z north, a PCP of almost 50 keV was observed. From the viewpoint of ionospheric physics, it is important to understand how the currents from the generator link up to the load currents.

Assuming that no current flows out of the bottom of this region, we obtain an expression for the field-aligned current (which is approximately vertical in the polar cap) at the top of the region: J || = ∫ \u000b s ( ∇ ⊥ · J ⊥ ) ds (8.12) Since the electric field is independent of the variable s , we can substitute (8.7) in (8.12) and remove the electric field and divergence operator from the integral to yield the expression J || = ∇ ⊥ · ( \u0003 ⊥ · E I ) (8.13) where \u0003 ⊥ is the height-integrated horizontal conductivity tensor. Breaking this expression into Hall and Pedersen components, we finally have J || = \u0004 p ( ∇ ⊥ · E I ) + E I · ∇ ⊥ \u0004 p + \u0004 H [ ∇ ⊥ · ( E I × s ) ] + ( E I × s ) · ∇ ⊥ \u0004 H (8.14)"},{"pageNumber":395,"pageContent":"386 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics We showed in Chapter 3 that, for an electrostatic field, ∇ ⊥ · ( E 1 × s ) is very small in the F region and above (incompressible flow), and thus J || = \u0004 P ( ∇ ⊥ · E I ) + E I · ∇ ⊥ \u0004 P + ( E I ×ˆ s ) · ∇ ⊥ \u0004 H (8.15) This expression shows explicitly that field-aligned currents are intimately related to spatial variations in the ionospheric electric field and conductivity. It is important to realize, however, that the field-aligned current in (8.15) is driven by some divergence of current in the generator, but modified by conductivity gradients and polarization field in the ionosphere. Next, consider the electric field in the closed field line region of the magne- tosphere. (We are still considering the southward IMF case.) In Chapter 1 we saw that the magnetic field lines in the boundary layer and the plasma sheet are distorted from a dipole shape to produce a magnetic tail extending away from the sun. This magnetic geometry has a tension (see Chapter 2) that exerts a force on the plasma. Together with the pressure gradient and the potential difference applied across the magnetosphere by the flowing solar wind, these forces pro- duce motion of the magnetospheric plasma on closed field lines and an associated dawn-to-dusk magnetospheric electric field in the tail. Further, since the gradient and tension forces are equivalent to the J × B force, the geometry requires the existence of electric currents and vice versa. Figure 8.2a shows the configura- tion of electric fields and currents in the ionosphere and magnetosphere. The tail (or neutral sheet) current, J T , flows across the tail near the magnetic equatorial plane to support the curl implied by the stretched magnetic field geometry. The tail current is closed primarily in the magnetosheath by currents flowing on the magnetopause (which are not shown in the figure). The ring current, J R , to first order flows in closed loops around the earth at distances between 2 and 10 earth radii ( R e ) and is driven primarily by pressure gradient forces. Any divergences in these currents must be closed by field-aligned currents that enter the ionosphere. The portion of the tail and ring current that is closed through the ionosphere is called the partial ring current, J PR . These currents, the so-called Region 2 cur- rents, are labeled R 2 in the figure and link the inner magnetosphere with the auroral oval near its equatorward edge. Region 1 currents, labeled R 1 , link the poleward portion of the auroral oval and the polar cap to the magnetosheath, solar wind, or the boundary layer plasma near the magnetopause. Figure 8.2b shows how the magnetospheric electric field, E m , maps to the ionosphere on closed field lines. The ionosphere is not a passive element in this circuit because some of the hot plasma in the magnetosphere can move along the magnetic field and strike the atmosphere, producing significant ionization. This particle precipitation produces the discrete and diffuse auroral airglow and can play a dominant role in determining the ionospheric conductivity in the eclipsed ionosphere. Notice that the electric field mapping causes the sign of the electric field to be reversed (e.g., Fig. 8.2b) so that in the ionospheric auroral zone the electric field E a is"},{"pageNumber":396,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 387 directed from dusk to dawn, which is opposite from the polar cap electric field. The resulting ionospheric plasma flow and electric field patterns are shown in Fig. 8.3a. The flow is made up of antisunward flow at the highest latitudes result- ing from the connection of the open magnetic field lines to the solar wind electric field discussed earlier. The return sunward flow in the auroral zones results from the electric field E a , which in turn is determined by the potential difference across the closed field line portion of the magnetosphere. Figure 8.3b shows the electric and magnetic fields measured in a polar pass of the S3-2 satellite field. The electric field detector had a higher spatial resolution but otherwise the measured electric field looks remarkably similar to the mag- netic field. It is easy to show that the Poynting flux is almost always downward and consistent with \u0004 P values for the polar cap and auroral oval (see the next section). The electric field reversal at the polar cap boundary is associated with the so-called Region 1 field-aligned or Birkeland currents ( R 1 in Fig. 8.2a) after the scientist who first postulated their existence. They are closed at one end by cur- rents in the magnetosheath. In the summer polar cap, a large fraction of the Region 1 currents close across the conducting polar cap. Note from examina- tion of Fig. 8.2 that the ionospheric and internal magnetospheric currents and associated electric fields all have the same direction at any one place, designating a load, whereas in the magnetosheath the electric field and current have opposite signs, as required for a generator. In fact, the entire system is analogous to a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator, where the solar wind in the magne- tosheath is the flowing conductor connected by the Region 1 Birkeland currents to the ionosphere-magnetosphere system, which is the load. Region 2 currents are connected to Region 1 currents by another (ρ/ B 2 ) B × d V / dt current, since the magnetic field increases as the plasma from the tail nears the earth and E / B decreases. Here J × B is antisunward (observe that J ⊥ flows counter to E ⊥ in the equatorial plan of Fig. 8.2b). 8.1.3 Energy Transfer Further insight into the methods by which energy is transmitted and converted in this system can be obtained from the idealized model of Region 1 currents and the closure current across the summer polar cap, shown in Fig. 8.4. Here, two parallel current sheets of thickness dx are oriented in the y - z plane and carry equal and opposite current densities in the z direction, which is along the magnetic field. These current sheets represent the Region 1 currents connecting the MHD generator in the solar wind or magnetosheath plasma to the ionosphere on the dawn and dusk sides of the polar cap, respectively. The current sheets are closed in the polar cap ionosphere, represented here as a resistive medium of vertical extent h having a uniform conductivity, σ p , perpendicular to the current sheets. Associated with the current sheets are a magnetic field (δ B ) and an electric field (δ E ) .

Thus, making use of δ B y = μ 0 J z dx and the fact that \u0004 p = σ p h , we have δ B y = μ 0 \u0004 p δ E x (8.17a) This equation may be rewritten in the equivalent forms δ E x = δ B y /μ 0 \u0004 p (8.17b) δ B y /δ E x = μ 0 \u0004 p (8.17c)"},{"pageNumber":400,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 391 S W W (a) d/2 d/2 J z Dusk J z (b) h \u0003 B y \u0003 B y \u0003 B y \u0004 p ± 0 \u0003 E x J x 5 \u0004 p \u0003 E x Dawn Figure 8.4 Schematic representation of field-aligned currents and closure currents in the polar cap ionosphere and the electric and magnetic fields associated with them. or \u0004 p = δ B y /μ 0 δ E x (8.17d) These expressions show that for a uniform \u0004 p the electric and magnetic fields at altitudes away from the ionospheric load should be highly correlated. DE-2 satellite observations have shown some events with just such correlations at a 99% confidence level (Sugiura et al., 1982), although Smiddy et al. (1980) have also shown examples where the correlation breaks down. The latter authors have interpreted their results in terms of the E I · ∇ ⊥ \u0004 p , term in (8.14) and (8.15), which must be ignored to derive the relationship above. One may consider the solar wind MHD generator as a voltage source characterized by the electric field δ E , which is attached to a resistive load characterized by \u0004 p . Then (8.17a) yields the perturbation magnetic field as a function of the load conductivity. This viewpoint may be applicable for the large- scale magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction (Lysak, 1985). Alternatively, the generator may be viewed as a current source. There is some evidence that the latter viewpoint is more accurate at smaller scales ( ≤ 100 km ) , since the"},{"pageNumber":401,"pageContent":"392 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics summer polar cap has much smaller electric fields in this scale size regime than does the winter polar cap (Vickrey et al., 1985). For such a current source, δ B would be fixed by the source and, from (8.17b), the electric field would then be determined by the ionospheric conductivity. The electric field would then be inversely proportional to \u0004 p and thus, larger in the winter polar cap, where the lack of solar illumination makes \u0004 p small. Figure 8.1b shows that this idea may be true, even at large scales. Further insight comes from considering the Poynting flux. In the geometry of Fig. 8.4, δ E × δ H is downward between the current sheets and the energy input is (δ E x δ B y /μ 0 ) W / m 2 . This energy must be dissipated as Joule heat in the ionosphere at the rate of W = J · E = σ p δ E 2 x . Integrating over the vertical extent of the ionosphere yields a dissipation rate of (\u0004 p δ E 2 x ) W / m 2 . Since the Poynting flux yields the power flow into the region per unit area, we may equate the two expressions, and once again we have the result (8.17c): δ B y /δ E x = μ 0 \u0004 P The two approaches are therefore self-consistent. To summarize, mechanical energy is converted into electromagnetic energy in the solar wind generator. It flows down the magnetic field lines to the iono- sphere as Poynting flux, where it is converted into heat by Joule dissipation. For the typical parameters of δ E x = 50 mV / m and δ B y = 500 nT, we can esti- mate the Poynting flux to be δ E x δ B y /μ 0 = 0 . 02 W / m 2 = 20 ergs / cm 2 · s. This is a substantial amount of energy, roughly 10 11 W over the whole region. It is important to notice also that an energy flux of 20 ergs / cm 2 · s is very large com- pared to typically observed energy fluxes in auroral particle precipitation except for extremely intense localized auroral arcs. In fact, the Joule heat input is the primary reason that the thermosphere has a local temperature maximum in the high-latitude region, which competes with the solar photon-driven temperature maximum that occurs near the subsolar point. 8.1.4 Additional Complexities Before leaving this introductory discussion, we emphasize several important con- siderations to keep in mind when examining the observations of high-latitude ionospheric plasma motion in the next section. First, the qualitative discussion presented previously is centered around a direct connection between the earth’s magnetic field and the IMF. The subsequent communication of the interplane- tary electric field to the ionosphere and the magnetosphere gives rise to a two- cell convection pattern as shown in Fig. 8.3a. This process, which produces antisunward flow on open field lines if the IMF has a component in the south- ward direction, was first described by Dungey (1961). Axford and Hines (1961) showed that a similar motion of the plasma at high latitudes would result if solar wind momentum was transferred across the magnetopause without any"},{"pageNumber":402,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 393 direct connection between the ionosphere and the solar wind magnetic fields. This process, called “viscous interaction,” produces a relatively narrow region of antisunward-flowing plasma just inside the magnetopause. This region is now called the equatorial magnetospheric boundary layer, and in this region the anti- sunward plasma flow occurs on closed field lines. The ionospheric flow pattern we described above for the electrical connection model (often called reconnec- tion) does not differ dramatically for a theory in which viscous interaction pro- duces the plasma flow in the ionosphere and thus the electric field pattern. The major difference is that the antisunward convecting plasma is on closed instead of open field lines. Second, when the interplanetary magnetic field is northward, the viscous interaction idea does not change very much but connection to the interplanetary magnetic field and the solar wind potential is drastically different. Since B z is northward roughly one-half of the time, it is not surprising that some of the flow patterns shown below are quite different from the idealized two-cell pattern discussed thus far. We also need to discuss the physics at the inner boundary of the region domi- nated by magnetospheric processes. We know from Chapters 3 and 5 that the electric field pattern on field lines within 3 or 4 earth radii is controlled primarily by the atmosphere. How does this transition take place? As the plasma in the magnetosphere flows toward the earth, it encounters an increasing magnetic field strength. Since the first adiabatic invariant is conserved (see Section 2.5.2), the perpendicular energy of the plasma increases. Since the gradient and curvature drifts of these particles depend on both their energy and charge, a zonal charge separation occurs with positive charges at dusk and negative charges at dawn. This creates an electric field pointed from dusk toward dawn in the inner mag- netosphere, which tends to cancel out the applied dawn-dusk electric field. The inner magnetosphere is therefore shielded from the magnetospheric electric field and the plasma flows around this region. This shielding only operates on long time scales, however, and fluctuations of the external field with periods shorter than eight hours or so can penetrate (see Chapter 3). Since the magnetospheric electric field is reduced to almost zero earthward of the ring current, the electric field due to the rotation of the earth becomes comparable to the magnetospheric field near this boundary. When this source of the plasma motion is included, the ionospheric flow paths acquire a corotating component and look like those shown in Fig. 8.5. At latitudes below about 50 ◦ (not shown on this figure), the plasma undergoes circular convection paths around the earth at the corotation speed. On the dusk side near 60 ◦ latitude, the corotation and the magnetospheric electric fields oppose each other, leading to complex flow trajectories that involve a stagnation point, marked S . At still higher latitudes, the two-cell convection pattern is preserved. The corresponding plasma flow paths in the equatorial plane of the inner magnetosphere might look like those shown in Fig. 8.6. Near the earth in the shaded region, plasma flows in concentric circles. This region is called the plasmasphere because it contains a cool, dense plasma. This region has a high plasma content since, once per"},{"pageNumber":403,"pageContent":"394 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Dusk S Dawn 60° 70° 80° 12 06 18 24 Figure 8.5 Ionospheric flow paths at high latitudes including the effect of corotation of the plasma with the earth.

To first order, the plasmasphere lies just inside the ring current and the plasma sheet field lines. Outside of this region, the flow is more or less toward the sun in the equatorial plane. Where a flow line meets the magnetopause, it is assumed either to make contact with the interplanetary field and flow back over the top of the magnetopause or to flow back down the flanks of the tail in the boundary layer. Figures 8.5 and 8.6 are in the sun-fixed frame. On the magnetic field lines in contact with the corotating plasmasphere, the ionosphere to first order corotates with the earth just as the atmosphere does. In Chapters 3 and 5 we worked in this earth-fixed frame where the corotation field vanishes and discussed the ionospheric “weather.” This involved electric fields and consequent plasma motions in the rotating frame, which had typical magnitudes of 1–10 mV / m and velocities of 20–200 m / s. For reference, in the equatorial plane the earth’s rotation speed at the surface is 434 m / s, while the corotation speed at L = 4 in the equatorial plane is near 2 km / s. 8.2 Observations of Ionospheric Convection Our knowledge of the large-scale motion of the high-latitude F-region plasma has come from satellite, rocket, balloon, and ground-based radar and magnetic field measurements. These and other measurement techniques have also been used extensively to study smaller-scale features of the plasma density and plasma motion associated with the aurora. This topic is dealt with in Chapter 10. No single measurement can provide a complete description of the large-scale motion of F-region plasma. Over a 24-hour period, for example, a satellite measurement can be repeated 10 to 15 times over the entire high-latitude range in the iono- sphere but only in a very limited local time region. Over the same time period a ground-based radar measurement can be made over the entire local time region but in a limited latitude range. A description of the high-latitude plasma motion is therefore made up from a synthesis of these complementary measurements, taken over a period of many years. For a time-independent system, ∇ × E =− ∂ B /∂ t = 0 and the electric field may be described by an electrostatic potential φ such that E =− ∇ φ . The electric field is perpendicular to a line of constant potential and is also perpendicular to the E × B motion of the plasma. Thus, the low temperature plasma flows along lines of constant potential and a pattern of equipotentials also represents the plasma flow pattern. Each measurement of electric field or plasma velocity therefore provides a signature of some portion of the convection pattern. These measure- ments show that the convection pattern is highly dependent on the orientation and the magnitude of the IMF. Recall from Chapter 1 that when discussing the IMF, its direction can be described in a number of ways. The z component can be negative or positive and the IMF is often referred to as southward or northward,"},{"pageNumber":405,"pageContent":"396 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics respectively. Similarly, the y component can be directed opposite to the earth’s revolution about the sun or parallel to it, which is referred to as positive or neg- ative, respectively. Finally, it is worth noting that the tendency of the IMF to assume a garden hose–like spiral in the solar wind means that, when the IMF is directed away from the sun, the y component is positive and when the field line is directed toward the sun, B y is negative. Thus, the terms “toward” and “away” are sometimes used in the literature to describe the sign of the IMF y component. One final note concerns the presentation of observational data at high latitudes. Since the earth’s magnetic field lines can be highly stretched on the nightside and slightly compressed on the dayside, a dipole representation is not very informative. Thus, it is frequently the practice to describe a point in the high-latitude region with two parameters. One is the L value, defined as the equatorial crossing point (in units of R E ) of the magnetic field line passing through the point. The second is the magnetic local time (MLT), defined using the angle between the earth-sun line and the plane containing the magnetic axis of the earth and a line from the center of the earth to the point. Frequently, the L value is expressed in terms of an invariant latitude \u000e where \u000e = cos − 1 ( 1 / √ L ) An L value of 4, then, corresponds to \u000e = 60 ◦ . In a centered dipole field, the latitude at which a magnetic field line passed through the surface of the earth would be equal to the invariant latitude. The MLT is almost always expressed in hours. It is also quite common to express the date as a five-digit number, called the Julian day. In this format the first two digits of the number denote the year while the last three digits denote which day of the year (assume that January 1 is day 1). The most radical differences in the convection pattern can be seen by com- paring signatures when the IMF is southward with signatures when the IMF is northward. The discussion following is divided into these two categories. How- ever, it should be emphasized that substantial variability exists in the convection pattern, and our understanding of the nature of the controlling factors is still evolving. 8.2.1 Observations During Southward IMF Figure 8.7a shows vectors representing the plasma velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field at points along a satellite track as the spacecraft passes through the high-latitude convection pattern during a period of southward IMF. The regions of sunward and antisunward convection are separated by well-defined reversals near dawn and dusk and the signature of the two-cell convection pat- tern is indicated by the dashed lines. The auroral zone is coincident with the sun- ward flow regions as described above. If we arbitrarily assign a zero value for the electrostatic potential at low latitudes, data of this nature can be integrated along the satellite track to produce a representative electrostatic potential distribution,"},{"pageNumber":406,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 397 Convection reversal Convection reversal 6 18 5 10 10 0 5 2 10 2 20 2 20 2 10 INV.

By joining points of equal potential deduced from the lower plot with a line that is locally parallel to the observed flow, it is pos- sible to deduce the flow pattern, as shown by the dashed lines in the upper plot. Typical electric field values of 10 to 50 mV / m (corresponding to flow velocities of 200 to 1000 m / s) in the sunward flow regions lead to maxima in the potential of the order of plus and minus 30 kV and a total potential drop across the open field line region of the polar cap of about 60 kV. This observed convection pat- tern is in qualitative agreement with our expectations from earlier consideration of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. However, only a fraction of the magnetospheric potential drop across a distance equal to the dimension of the magnetosphere appears across the ionospheric polar cap. For example, using our previous estimate for the solar wind electric field of 2 mV / m, we obtain a total potential of about 500 kV across a magnetosphere of typical width 40 R e . This indicates that the region of direct connection of the earth’s magnetic field to the IMF is much smaller than the width of the magnetosphere. The next series of figures shows more examples of the measurements used in the derivation of high-latitude convection patterns. They illustrate the most important variations in the plasma flow pattern when the IMF has a southward component ( B z < 0 ) . The following points should be noted. 1. Average auroral zone pattern. The average electric field pattern in the auroral oval determined from 500 h of balloon electric field measurements is presented in Fig. 8.8a. The dominant variation is diurnal with the meridional component considerably larger than the zonal component. When collated with respect to high and low K p values, the pattern does not change much in shape but the amplitude of the dominant feature decreases by about a factor of 2 as K p varies from 6 to 0. 2. Seasonal dependence. In Fig. 8.8b the plasma motion in a direction almost parallel to the earth-sun line is shown for two dawn-dusk satellite passes. The figure illustrates that the plasma velocity is considerably more structured in the winter (Southern) hemisphere (top panel) than in the summer hemisphere. In both cases, however, the data are consistent with a two-cell convection pattern. This is characterized by two large-scale reversals (shown by the heavy arrows) that separate regions of antisun- ward flow (dawn-to-dusk electric field) from regions of sunward flow (dusk-to-dawn electric field). As shown in Fig. 8.8b, passes only 45 minutes apart can show average fields twice as large in the winter hemisphere as in summer. 3. Variability. Figure 8.8c shows the plasma drift velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field measured along a satellite track during two passes through the high-latitude ionosphere using a vector representation. Notice that for these quite similar IMF conditions, the latitudinal extent of the sunward flow in the auroral zones is quite different. Also the magnitude of the antisunward flow in the polar cap is quite different in these two cases. 4. Response to B y . Figure 8.8d again shows the ion drift velocity vector perpendicular to the magnetic field for two passes through the high-latitude ionosphere. In the first pass (top panel) B y is negative, and in the bottom panel B y is positive. Notice that when B y is positive, the sunward flow from the dusk side passes across local noon in the auroral zone before flowing antisunward. When B y is negative, the sunward flow from the dawn side passes across local noon before flowing antisunward."},{"pageNumber":408,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 399 Southward component Westward component 40 20 2 20 2 40 2 20 2 40 40 20 0 0 00 04 08 12 16 20 24 Local time Electric field (mV/m) (a) Figure 8.8a Hourly averages of auroral zone electric field data from balloon flights.

[After Mozer and Lucht (1974). Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] These observations show that the ionospheric conductivity, the internal state of the magnetosphere, and the external state of the interplanetary environment can all affect the high-latitude ionospheric convection pattern. However, when the IMF has a southward component, a two-cell convection pattern made up of predominantly antisunward convection at the highest latitudes with sunward convection occurring at lower latitudes is almost always observed. In principle, a number of different radar stations and satellites operating at the same time can provide a simultaneous signature of the convection pattern at different local times. Alternatively, if some degree of stability in the convection pattern is assumed, a single radar site can sample all local times over a substantial latitudinal width of the pattern during a day. These techniques and the previously mentioned statistical syntheses of data bases are currently being used to elucidate details of the seasonal dependence in the convection pattern and the factors deter- mining the convection speed. A climatological model by Weimer (1995, 2001), driven by solar wind parameters, provides a synthesis of the existing data. The dependence on B y is well documented for that portion of the convection pattern on the sunward side of the dawn-dusk meridian and is shown schematically in Fig. 8.9.

In addition, the entire region of significant plasma motion is confined to much higher latitudes than in the southward IMF case. Figure 8.11 shows several examples of the dawn-to-dusk electric field measured at high latitudes when the IMF had a northward component. The shaded regions show the existence of a dusk-to-dawn field and thus sunward flow deep in the polar cap. Quite frequently, the flow is extremely structured at small scales, and observations can look more typically like those shown in Fig. 8.12a. Despite the difficulties associated with the recognition of convection features during northward IMF, a qualitative description is possible, as summarized in Fig. 8.12b. When the IMF has a northward component, four convection cells can be identified in the dayside hemisphere. Two high-latitude cells circulate in a manner that produces sunward convection at the highest latitudes.

When B y is positive, the clockwise circulation in the high-latitude dawn cell tends to expand into the dusk side, and the anticlockwise cell virtually disappears. Expansion of the dawn cell is apparent as B y becomes positive. The lower-latitude convection cells circulate in the manner expected during a southward IMF. Their geometry and position show no strong dependence on the IMF y component and the total potential drop across these cells rarely exceeds 10 kV. It may well be that this part of the convection pattern is driven by the viscous interaction described earlier. These patterns correspond to a steady state, which is probably never attained. One experiment has revealed how the polar cap dynamically changes from B z south to B z north. Three rockets were flown during just such a transition. It is well known that the polar cap shrinks when B z turns north. These data suggest that this occurs when an auroral arc surges sunward, bringing sunward convection behind it.

At the highest latitudes, antisunward convection is associated with similar flow in the magnetosheath, while sunward convection at lower latitudes is associated with flow in the plasma sheet.

When this breakdown occurs, the term “merging” or “recon- nection” is frequently used to describe the phenomenon. A description of the plasma processes involved in a merging or reconnection region is beyond the scope of this book. It is convenient, however, to use these terms when describing moving magnetic field lines that change their identity either from an open to a closed topology or from one open topology to another. 8.3.1 Models for Southward IMF We have seen that many ionospheric observations indicate that the IMF exer- cises significant control over the plasma convection pattern. From examining the energetic electron precipitation patterns at high latitudes and the direct detection of solar cosmic rays in the polar ionosphere, it is generally believed that the anti- sunward flow in the polar cap during a southward IMF exists on open magnetic field lines.

When the sunward flow of the auroral zone crosses the polar cap and becomes antisunward, we use the term merging to describe the process by which closed field lines become open and connected to the interplanetary magnetic field (Dungey, 1961). The term “reconnection” describes the process by which open magnetic field lines are joined in the mag- netotail to produce a closed field line. The reconnection region must correspond in the ionosphere to the region where antisunward flow crosses the polar cap boundary and becomes sunward. With these two processes in mind, Fig. 8.14a shows that a southward-pointing IMF field line (A-B) breaks and merges with the earth’s field at point N1. Still attached to the solar wind, that field line moves across the polar cap and eventually rejoins a field line from the other hemisphere at point N2. During this time the interplanetary electric field penetrates down into the ionosphere, where it drives an antisunward flow. This picture is not to scale since the solar wind velocity is so large that, by the time the foot point in the ionosphere traverses the polar cap, the other end of the field line is very far away from the earth. Hence, a long magnetic tail forms on the nightside. The time history of convecting plasma or flux tubes in the magnetosphere and ionosphere during the circulation of plasma in one cell of the two-cell convection pattern is shown in Fig. 8.14b. As just noted, on the dayside at point 1, a closed magnetic field line of the earth “breaks” and connects with the interplanetary magnetic field to produce an open field line.

However, simultaneous observations of the convection signature and the energetic particle environment indicate that the magnetic field topology is often open. Likewise, theoretical considerations of the physics involved in a viscous interaction indicate that the potential asso- ciated with this mechanism is usually less than 10 kV. Observed cross-polar cap potentials in excess of 60 kV and the dependence of the convection geometry on the y component of the solar wind magnetic field strongly suggest that the merg- ing process dominates over viscous interaction when the IMF has a southward component. Although a rigorous discussion of the way in which the solar wind and earth’s magnetic fields interconnect is beyond the scope or requirements of this book, it is possible to understand the basic properties of the convection geometry from rather simple considerations. We start by assuming that field lines interconnect when they have antiparallel components in a plane perpendicular to the earth- sun line (the y - z plane). Figure 8.16 shows views from above the north pole of one of the earth’s magnetic field lines that is connected to the IMF when the IMF y component is nonzero. In the situation for negative B y , once merging has taken place the newly open field lines have extremely large curvature near the merging point. The resulting tension in the Northern Hemisphere open field lines will produce a duskward component in the plasma flow in the dayside magnetosphere. A corresponding duskward plasma flow will exist in the dayside polar cap of the northern hemispheric ionosphere.

Similar arguments can be applied to the situation when B y is positive. In this case a dawnward flow component will be seen in the northern ionospheric polar cap flow. This rather simple idea can account for the B y dependence of the ionospheric flow direction seen near local noon in Fig. 8.9 and for the dependence of the flow speed at the dawn and dusk edges of the polar cap on B y (Heppner, 1972). This dependence is such that in the Northern Hemisphere a larger flow speed is seen near the dawn side of the polar cap when B y is positive and a larger flow speed is seen at the dusk side of the polar cap when B y is negative. Also note that this simple model predicts that the B y dependences seen in the Northern Hemisphere appear in the opposite sense for the Southern Hemispheres, a fact borne out by observation. 8.3.2 Models for Northward IMF The pattern of the high-latitude circulation cells during northward IMF can again be understood by the rather simple concepts of merging and frozen-in flux used in the case of southward IMF. As we shall see, a number of different magnetic field topologies might exist during times of northward IMF. Experimental and theo- retical investigations in this area are still being undertaken and we will describe here only some of the basic concepts involved. One way in which the earth’s magnetospheric field may connect to a northward IMF is shown in Fig. 8.17. Here magnetic field lines that extend into the tail of the magnetosphere have the right orientation for merging to occur with a northward IMF at position 1.

In Fig. 8.17 the field line remains open and convects down the tail and toward the earth-sun line until it assumes the position of the original field tube (1 \b -1). The associated convection is labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 1 in which the antisunward flow toward the earth-sun line at the magnetopause corresponds to sunward flow 3 \b ,4 \b ,1 \b in the ionosphere. Alternative or additional convection paths in which field tubes reconnect at point 3 and subsequently flow sunward in a plasma sheet that thickens along the earth-sun line have been proposed to explain the possible existence of closed magnetic field lines at the highest latitudes. It should be emphasized that the precise location of the transition from open to closed field lines in the ionosphere can be quite variable within the picture we have drawn. The convective motion described above exists in addition to the viscous inter- action mechanism described earlier, and we must invoke both of them to explain the four-cell convection pattern that is most frequently observed. We note that the tendency of the flow of the inner two cells to be preferentially directed toward dawn or dusk, depending on whether B y is positive or negative, can again be explained by the effective “tension” in connection to the IMF (see Fig. 8.16). 8.4 Empirical and Analytical Representations of High-Latitude Convection As we shall see in Chapter 9, knowledge of the high-latitude ionospheric convec- tion pattern is required to effectively calculate the distribution and composition of plasma in the F region and to determine the F-region neutral wind field and Joule heating rate. For such studies it is necessary to know the ionospheric flow velocity at all points at any given time. This requirement has led to the develop- ment of several empirical and semi-empirical models for the convection pattern designed to mimic one or more of the features described in previous sections. These models are derived from a synthesis or statistical analysis of satellite and radar data. A global representation of the electrostatic potential distribution derived from satellite electric field measurements is shown in Fig. 8.18. This empirical model is valid for southward B z and is shown for the IMF with B y negative (a) and positive (b). It depicts several of the major properties of the convective flow that we have previously noted in individual cases. For example, the ion flow or electric field is larger on the dawn side than on the dusk side in the Northern Hemisphere when B y is positive (i.e., the potential lines are closer together). Figure 8.18b also shows the existence of a crescent-shaped convec- tion cell on the dusk side similar to that shown in Fig. 8.10d.

More detailed distributions of the electrostatic potential in the sunward flow regions have been obtained from ground-based radars that probe this region of the ionosphere. Many years of data from these radars can be sorted by latitude and local time as well as by magnetic activity and solar wind conditions. Tabu- lated values of the coefficients of functional fits to these data are then available. Figure 8.19 shows examples of these average convection patterns derived from radars at Chatanika, Alaska, and Millstone Hill. Although data such as these do not cover the entire high-latitude region, they do provide a means of assessing the effects of magnetic activity on the auroral zone flow, a task that is not easily accomplished using satellite data. Analytical models use a collection of mathematical expressions to specify the electrostatic potential as a function of position in the high-latitude F region. The comparative ease with which they can be incorporated into computer code makes them the most often used in F-region modeling studies, and here we provide illustrative examples. With this technique the polar cap is usually designated as a circle and outside this circle the potential θ decays via an inverse power law sine wave.

Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] Here θ is magnetic co-latitude, φ 0 is the potential at the polar cap boundary where θ = θ 0 , and the index n typically takes values between − 2 and − 4. Inside the polar cap boundary, Volland (1975) showed that if φ = φ 0 ( sin θ/ sin θ 0 ) sin ( H ) (8.18b) where H is the local hour angle (MLT), then the lines of electrostatic equipoten- tial depict convective flow that is antisunward inside the polar cap. This model can be modified to allow φ 0 to take different values on the dawn- and dusk-side polar cap boundaries and to allow the origin of the potential coordinate system to be displaced from the magnetic pole. It has been used extensively in F-region modeling studies where the offset between the geomagnetic and geographic poles has also been taken into account. To reproduce such observations as the crescent-shaped cell in the dusk sector and the predominance of eastward or westward flow at local noon, some mod- ifications to the mathematical model can be made. These include the removal of any local time dependence of the potential in certain local time sectors and the removal of the latitudinal discontinuity in the potential gradient at the polar cap boundary. A variety of convection geometries are then available with real- istic field-aligned current densities similar to those described in Section 8.5. The challenge of producing mathematical models that adequately describe the effects of changing B y when the IMF is southward and the four-cell convection pattern when the IMF is northward still remains. In our description in previous sections we have shown how the IMF exercises a large degree of control on the geometry or shape of the convection cells. This"},{"pageNumber":424,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 415 geometry is related to the distribution of electrostatic potential around the polar cap boundary and within the polar cap itself. These are the two fundamental properties addressed by empirical models. To date, our description has been only qualitative or empirical. There is, however, convincing evidence that merging or direct connection with the solar wind dynamo via the IMF is an important contributor to the flow in the polar cap. In this case we may reasonably ask what effect interplanetary conditions have on the magnitude of the drift velocities or, alternatively, on the size of the polar cap and the potential drop across it. In this area an analytical model can be extremely useful. A model developed by Siscoe (1982) describes the Region 1 and Region 2 field- aligned currents introduced in Section 8.1 as two concentric rings. A potential φ is assumed to be distributed sinusoidally in local time around the region 1 ring. Then consideration of the conservation of magnetic flux in the ionosphere and the energy dissipated in the Region 2 current loop can be used to show that, in an equilibrium situation, the radius of the Region 1 circle—that is, the polar cap radius r —is related to the potential by the expression r = r 0 φ 3 / 16 (8.19) Here r 0 depends on the ionospheric conductivity and the width of the auroral zone, but these quantities may be considered as constants to first order. The limited data that exist do not disagree with this relationship, but the exponent on the potential is extremely small and thus, for potential differences exceeding about 20 kV, the polar cap radius is almost independent of the magnitude of φ . Magnetic storms and substorms (discussed briefly in the next section) are known to cause expansions of the polar cap and the entire convection pattern, but even a qualitative description of this behavior has not yet been accomplished. The polar cap potential drop is, however, found to be a strong function of the interplanetary magnetic field magnitude and orientation. From rather simple considerations, one might expect that the potential difference depends on the area over which the IMF and geomagnetic field interconnect and the efficiency with which the electric field in the interplanetary medium is transferred across that area. Hill (1975) approached this problem by determining the dissipative component of the solar wind electric field at the magnetopause (i.e., the com- ponent parallel to the magnetopause current) that separates an internal earth’s magnetic field, B 2 , from an external field, B 1 (the IMF). He called this field the merging region field and denoted it by E j . He then showed that this field and the relative orientation of the magnetic fields on either side of the magnetopause would determine the effective potential transmitted across the boundary to the ionosphere. The electric field in the merging region can be expressed as E j = E 0 α 2 ( α − cos θ ) 2 1 + α 2 − 2 α cos θ (8.20)"},{"pageNumber":425,"pageContent":"416 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics 200 150 100 50 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 E J / E O F (kV) Figure 8.20 Measured polar cap potential difference, φ , plotted as a function of the quan- tity E j / E 0 defined in (8.20).

The total potential drop \u0007 across the polar cap due to the merging field is simply \u0007 = E j d , where d represents the length of the magnetopause merging region. One would therefore expect that, when the IMF has no component perpendicular to the sheet current at the magnetopause (and thus E j = 0), \u0007 should also be zero. Observations of the polar cap potential difference are plotted in Fig. 8.20 against values of E i calculated for the measured solar wind and the earth’s magnetic fields at different times. The E j is normalized to E 0 , which depends on the plasma density in the solar wind and the earth’s magnetic field. As the solar wind magnetic field changes, the observed potential does not go to zero when E j = 0. This additional potential difference may be related to electric fields communicated by processes other than merging or to a time response of the magnetosphere- ionosphere system that does not allow it to change instantaneously when the IMF changes. Figure 8.21 shows the results of studying the time response of the ionosphere- magnetosphere system to a change in the north-south component of the IMF. It shows the polar cap potential difference measured as a function of time after the IMF turns northward. The data suggest that relatively large potentials, associ- ated with a two-cell convection pattern, tend to persist for 1 or 2 hours following a transition from southward to northward IMF. After this time quite small polar cap potential differences are observed. Bearing in mind the uncertainties in defin- ing the polar cap, these small values are consistent with a multicell convection pattern for a northward IMF. It is interesting to note that this time delay is consis- tent with the time required to reverse a two-cell convection pattern in the neutral gas that is established during a southward IMF (see Chapter 9).

In such a case, J · E < 0 in the ionosphere and the Poynting flux is upward. Rocket data indicate that shrinkage of the polar cap for B z north occurs in discrete steps accompanied by new auroral arc generation poleward of the instantaneous auroral oval (Berg et al., 1994). Alternatively, this decay may be the time constant required to dis- sipate stored magnetic energy by Joule heating at ionospheric altitudes (Kelley et al., 2009). The observations of the flow geometry when the IMF has a northward com- ponent are not sufficiently advanced to make quantitative analysis possible. As mentioned earlier, it is likely that processes other than merging (e.g., viscous interaction) may be important in producing the ionospheric motion in this case, and advances in this area are occurring at the time of this writing. An excel- lent climatological model for magnetospheric convection has been developed by Weimer (1995, 2001). 8.5 Observations of Field-Aligned Currents Field-aligned currents are essential to the linkage between the solar wind- magnetosphere system and the ionosphere. The ionosphere is not a passive ele- ment in the electric field mapping process between these regions and, in fact, the electric field can be modified at the driver and throughout the system by the iono- sphere. This is particularly true in the auroral zone, where the ionosphere and magnetosphere are linked and the hot plasma sheet particles can determine the ionospheric conductivity through particle precipitation. Study of these currents"},{"pageNumber":427,"pageContent":"418 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics yields information comparable in importance to measurements of the convective motions. Field-aligned currents, frequently called Birkeland currents after the man who first postulated their existence (see Section 8.1), can be detected by the magnetic perturbation they produce. A current flowing in a direction parallel to the earth’s magnetic field will produce a magnetic perturbation δ B in a direction perpen- dicular to the field. From the diagnostic equation (2.23c) in Chapter 2, the two quantities are related by μ 0 J || = ( ∇ × δ B ) || (8.21) The magnetic disturbances can be observed by satellite and rocket-borne mag- netometers that measure three mutually perpendicular components of the dis- turbance vector. A measurement along a single trajectory does not allow the determination of a curl, so in practice some approximations are necessary to derive J || . Field-aligned currents frequently, but not always, occur as sheets whose dimen- sions in one horizontal direction greatly exceed those in the other (see Fig. 8.4). The magnetic disturbance is then predominantly parallel to the sheet, and Fig. 8.22 shows schematically the disturbance that would be measured on passing perpendicularly through the sheet. The current density is given by (8.21), which simplifies to μ 0 J || = (∂/∂ x )(δ B y ) , and for the dimensions shown in Fig. 8.22 the disturbance would correspond to an outward current sheet of density 0 . 8 μ A / m 2 . Most observations are not, of course, made with the convenience of such per- pendicular crossings of the current sheet, so care must be taken in the arbitrary application of (8.21). In general, the full perturbation vector is measured, so in many cases only a rotation of a coordinate system is required to determine J || .A statistical analysis of satellite magnetometer data of this kind has enabled a sys- tematic picture of field-aligned current directions, magnitudes, and locations to be derived.

There exist essentially two concentric field-aligned current rings approximately the same as those predicted from the simple considerations of Section 8.1. 2.

In the magnetic local time sector from 2200 to 2400 hours, three regions of field- aligned current are formed by the overlap of the two rings seen at other local times. 5. During magnetically active periods there is a slight expansion of both current rings to lower latitudes. The region of overlap then increases to occupy the MLT region from 2200 to 0100 hours.

However, there is an additional current system that shows a strong dependence on the IMF and has a dominant polarity that for strong B y is opposite in the two hemispheres. This additional current system is called the cusp current and, as shown in Fig. 8.24, it lies just poleward of the Region 1 currents near local noon.

The current directions are opposite to the adjacent Region 1 currents, being downward into the ionosphere in the afternoon and upward away from the ionosphere in the morning. Change in the sign of B y significantly affects this distribution. Observations made in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres show that when B y > 0, the cusp region current is extremely asymmetric and is predominantly upward in the Northern Hemisphere and downward in the Southern Hemisphere. When B y < 0, the current is pre- dominantly downward in the north and upward in the south. 8.5.2 Current Patterns for a Northward IMF When the IMF has a northward component, the distribution of field-aligned currents changes quite dramatically (as does the electric field distribution). The two-ring pattern of field-aligned currents is retained, but they are seen to move to higher latitudes and are significantly reduced in intensity. Perhaps more signif- icant is a reorganization of the cusp currents in such a way that they expand over most of the high-latitude area enclosed by the Region 1 currents and become as intense as the Region 1 and Region 2 currents themselves. This new cusp cur- rent system has been called the “NBZ” current system to denote the northward- directed B z component that exists during its occurrence. The NBZ current system again shows a strong dependence on the sign of B y , and Fig. 8.25 shows schemat- ically its location and distribution in the Southern Hemisphere. Except for their dramatic redistribution in area, the NBZ currents show essentially the same behavior as the cusp currents, being predominantly downward in the Southern Hemisphere when B y is positive and upward when B y is negative.

In all of these descriptions, the field-aligned current density is regarded as being uniform in each of the Region 1 and Region 2 rings, so a magnitude and a local time distribution can be ascribed to them.

The maximum Region 1 current intensities occur between about 0800 and 1000 h on the morning side and between about 1400 and 1600 h on the afternoon side. At these times the Region 1 currents are about a factor of 2 to 3 greater than the corresponding Region 2 currents. During equinox and winter, the Region 1 and Region 2 currents show relatively little dependence on local time except for the two Region 1 current maxima. In the summer, however, it is found that the Region 1 currents can exceed the Region 2 currents at all local times, although the region of maximum difference remains on the dayside. The Region 2 currents show a much higher degree of variability with magnetic activity than do the Region 1 currents. This can lead to situations on the nightside in which the Region 2 currents exceed the Region 1 currents during disturbed periods. The magnitude of the Region 1 currents shows a strong dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field, as might be expected from arguments similar to those applied for the polar cap potential difference. Figure 8.27 shows the depen- dence of the morningside and afternoonside Region 1 currents on the magnitude of the solar wind electric field. These data show that the field-aligned currents increase as the electric field associated with the IMF increases from zero. Simi- lar conclusions concerning the polar cap potential difference were drawn from Fig. 8.20, so it is not surprising that the driving currents should show the same behavior. As in the case of the polar cap potential difference, the Region 1 current density does not reduce to zero when the solar wind electric field reduces to zero. This observation supports the existence of a mechanism in addition to merging (perhaps viscous interaction) that also provides driving currents for ionospheric convection. 8.6 Horizontal Currents at High Latitudes Equations (8.7) and (8.12) represent the fundamental relationships between hor- izontal and field-aligned currents and the electric field and conductivity in the ionosphere. The discussion of the dependence of the ionospheric conductivity on altitude given in Chapter 2 shows that the region over which substantial currents flow perpendicular to the magnetic field lines is restricted to the range from about 90 to about 130 km in the sunlit ionosphere and may extend up to 300 km when no appreciable local ionization source is present. This current flow is almost horizontal at high latitudes and produces a magnetic signature that can be observed on the ground. It has been shown, however, that ground magnetometers respond primarily to Hall currents and thus cannot be directly converted to electric fields (Piddington, 1962). Ground-based magnetometers function somewhat differently from those on satellites, but their output, three mutually perpendicular components of the mag- netic perturbation from a normal steady baseline, is the same.

For these reasons the ground magnetic perturbations are usually expressed in terms of “equiva- lent” ionospheric currents. The study of magnetic perturbations and their inter- pretations as current systems in the earth and in space is extremely complex and we will not discuss this topic in detail. However, magnetic perturbations are used to describe phenomena such as magnetic storms and substorms and to derive indices such as DST, K p , and AE that describe the magnetic activity in the earth’s environment. It is therefore necessary to discuss the meaning of these indices and the nature of the magnetic measurements. This discussion is located in Appendix B. Essentially two techniques are utilized to derive the equivalent overhead hori- zontal current flowing in a thin shell near 100 km altitude. One method calculates the magnetic signature on the ground from a current flowing east-west in a small horizontal cell which in turn flows into field-aligned currents at the edges of the cell (Kisabeth and Rostoker, 1971). The field-aligned currents are assumed to flow along dipole magnetic field lines and subsequently close in the equatorial plane. By a “best-fit” process, this technique yields the total three-dimensional current system (horizontal and field-aligned) that produces the measured ground magnetic perturbations. The other, more widely used method expresses the overhead current J in terms of a divergence-free component sometimes called the equivalent current J e and a curl-free component sometimes called the potential current J p . The potential current can be viewed as the closing current for the field-aligned currents. For vertical magnetic field lines it can be shown that the field-aligned and potential current circuit produces no magnetic perturbation at the ground. Further, if the ionospheric conductivity is uniform it can be shown that the potential current is the Pedersen current. In this case, since other magnetic effects are small, the equivalent current will largely represent the horizontal ionospheric Hall current. Since it is divergence-free, the equivalent current can be expressed in terms of a current function \u0010 such that J e = r ×∇ \u0010 (8.22) where r is the unit radial vector in a coordinate system with the origin at the center of the earth. No current flows near the ground, so the magnetic perturbation there, δ B , can be expressed in terms of a magnetic potential φ such that δ B =−∇ φ (8.23) There are straightforward mathematical relationships that uniquely relate \u0010 and φ so that the horizontal equivalent current can be derived from the potential"},{"pageNumber":435,"pageContent":"426 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics function φ . The function φ is determined by taking the divergence of (8.23) and solving the two-dimensional Poisson equation ∇ 2 φ =−∇· δ B (8.24) The right-hand side of this equation is given by a global distribution of ground observations with suitable interpolation at each grid point. These two quite different techniques yield very similar results for the hor- izontal equivalent ionospheric current. In principle, only the equivalent cur- rent can be derived from ground magnetic perturbations, and some model of ionospheric conductivity is required to proceed further. However, many fea- tures of the equivalent current system are useful in establishing self-consistency among the electrodynamic parameters and we will now describe these characteristics. Our purpose here is to describe the dependence of the equivalent current dis- tribution on magnetic activity and the interplanetary magnetic field orientation. In this way a self-consistent picture of the electrodynamic parameters J ⊥ , J || , and E ⊥ can be established. The effects of magnetic activity on the horizontal equivalent current manifest themselves principally in small-scale features that we will discuss later. The large-scale features of the horizontal current and its dependence on the IMF are shown in Fig. 8.28. A two-cell pattern of current flow exists for all orientations of the IMF. In each of the pictures, the current flows in closed loops around a focus labeled “ + ,” located on the nightside near midnight, and around a focus labeled “ − ,” located on the dayside near noon. The sense of circulation of the current is clockwise around the + focus and anticlockwise around the − focus. When the IMF has a southward component ( B z < 0 ) the current is much larger and the two-cell pattern is more well defined than when the IMF is northward. Examining the southward IMF case in more detail, we note that at the low-latitude extremes of the current system there exist bands of current flowing, respectively, eastward on the dusk side and westward on the dawn side. These current bands are collocated with the diffuse auro- ral zones and are called the eastward and westward electrojets. Note that the direction of the electrojet currents is opposite to that of the F-region plasma flow. The fact that a two-cell current pattern is retained for all orientations of the IMF indicates that some element of the current pattern may be independent of the IMF. Statistical analysis of ground-based magnetograms shows this to be the case, and this portion of the current system is called the S p q (“solar quiet polar”) current system. Detailed analysis shows that there may also exist semidiurnal contributions to this current that may be attributable to lunar variations, as is the case in the equatorial region. For a southward IMF during times of relatively low magnetic activity (i.e., K p < 3), the total current system is made up of the S p q system plus another system called the DP2 system; the DP2 current system is made up of the DPY and DPZ"},{"pageNumber":436,"pageContent":"High-Latitude Electrodynamics 427 Equivalent current system 12 12 18 18 18 2 80 2 80 2 80 1 2 12 2 80 80 12 12 06 06 20 kA 80 80 160 0 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 160 2 160 2 160 2 80 2 80 40 80 12 80 06 60 8 60 8 60 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Eastward electrojet Westward electrojet 0 0 0 22 2 1 1 1 B z . 0 B y 5 0 B y , 0 B y , 0 B y , 0 B y 5 0 B y 5 0 B y . 0 B y . 0 B y . 0 B z 5 0 B z , 0 2 160 2 160 80 2 80 0 2 280 160 160 0 2 80 80 Figure 8.28 Contours showing the horizontal equivalent currents for different orienta- tions of B z and B y .

This “DPY current” flows from dawn to dusk when B y is positive and from dusk to dawn when B y is negative. The DPY current produces a rotation and an asymmetry in the current vortices so that the high-latitude sunward- flowing current is directed toward the prenoon sector for both polarities of the IMF. When the z component of the IMF is very small the two-cell horizontal current system is preserved, but the intensity of the current is much less than that existing when the IMF is strongly southward. As B y changes from negative to positive, the line of symmetry for the current vortices rotates clockwise as it does for a southward IMF.

We have defined the high-latitude ionosphere as that region of latitudes in which (at least some of the time) the plasma flows in magnetic flux tubes that either have only one foot on the ground or are so extended that the effect of connecting to the conjugate hemisphere is negligible on the local plasma. From our knowledge of the high-latitude convection pattern, we know that such a definition can include the ionosphere at invariant latitudes above about 50 ◦ . In this region the ionospheric plasma may be subject to “bound- ary conditions” in the outer magnetosphere that allow rapid expansion along the magnetic field lines. We also know that within this region the plasma velocities per- pendicular to the magnetic field can be of the order of 1 km/s. This gives the bulk thermal plasma some very different properties from those found at lower altitudes, and it is necessary to consider the details of ionospheric plasma motion, both par- allel and perpendicular to the magnetic field, in order to understand them. The high plasma velocities that occur in this region also greatly affect neutral atmospheric dynamics. 9.1 Ionospheric Effects of Parallel Plasma Dynamics 9.1.1 Ionospheric Composition at High Latitudes The effects of plasma motion along the magnetic field can be seen most dramat- ically in the ionospheric composition near an altitude of 1000 km as a function of latitude. At this altitude the ionosphere has essentially three ion species: O + , H + , and He + . Figure 9.1 shows the quiet-time average distribution of these ion species for satellite passes across the polar region from the dayside ( ∼ 1635 magnetic local time) to the nightside ( ∼ 0446 magnetic local time).

In the same latitude sector the O + concentration is nearly constant on the dayside and shows only a gradual change at night. This signature in the light ion species may be seen at all altitudes where the species H + or He + is detectable and is a persistent feature at all local times. It is called the light ion trough. The latitude gradient in the H + concentration defines the equatorward edge of the light ion trough and the magnitude of the gradient may change significantly as a function of local time and season. Its position is also strongly dependent on magnetic activity. As we shall see in Section 9.2, the magnetic dependence is a straightforward consequence of the variability of convection paths of the plasma that, in fact, determine where the trough will be formed. This large area of depressed light ion concentrations relative to the O + concentration can be produced only by a field-aligned motion of the light ions relative to O + . Satellite-borne ion mass spectrometers have observed this relative motion at altitudes below 2000 km as well as at much higher altitudes. The light ion velocities are described as"},{"pageNumber":443,"pageContent":"Ionospheric Response to Electric Fields 435 the “polar wind.” The velocity of the light ions can, in fact, be supersonic at times. The existence of the polar wind and the depressed light ion concentra- tions at high latitudes indicates that in this region the light ion population of the ionosphere is usually not in diffusive equilibrium along the magnetic field lines. 9.1.2 Hydrodynamic Theory of the Polar Wind In Chapters 2 and 5 we discussed the forces that contribute to motion of the ionospheric plasma along the magnetic field. In these discussions we included the generation of an electric field with a component along the magnetic field lines that was created internally by the plasma. This “ambipolar” field does not drive a current parallel to the magnetic field but merely serves to equalize the forces on the ions and electrons so they move together. In the inner magnetosphere the field lines are closed and relatively short in length. This allows the flux tubes to fill to a condition of equilibrium on a time scale of a day or so. Under normal conditions, then, the plasma is produced during the daytime and tends to flow slowly up into the inner magnetosphere. At night the flow is reversed and plasma tends to flow back into the ionosphere from above, replacing the ionospheric plasma against recombination losses. Charge exchange converts O + to H + and vice versa at the top of the ionosphere. The crucial difference between the high- and low-latitude cases is that, in the former, the flux tubes are either open or so long that no semblance of diffusive equilibrium exists. In effect, whatever plasma is produced by sunlight or particle influx merely expands into a near vacuum. Below about 2000 km, we learned that collision frequencies and gyrofrequen- cies are sufficiently high that, for most problems, the acceleration term may be neglected in the equations of motion. In this region the plasma is said to be colli- sion dominated, meaning that the ions undergo several collisions while moving through one scale height. A plasma is collision dominated if ( V i / H i ) \u0004 ν i where V i is the field-aligned ion velocity and H i and ν i are the ion scale height and appropriate collision frequency, respectively. However, since the upper boundary condition is crucial at high latitudes, we cannot make this approximation or restrict ourselves to altitudes below 2000 km. Note that it is not our intent here to provide all the mathematical details involved in the theoretical formation of parallel ion flow in such a situation; we only outline the initial steps and give some physical insight into the phenomenon based on experiments and simple model calculations.

The velocity of the j th ion species then can be found from the hydrodynamic equation (2.22b): ρ j ( V j · ∇ ) V j =− ∇ p j + ρ j g + n j q j ( E + V j × B ) − ∑ k ρ j ν jk ( V j − V k ) (9.1) We drop the ∂/∂ t term under an assumption of steady-state flow conditions in time. In the equation of motion for the electrons, the terms containing the electron mass can be neglected, as can the acceleration and advective derivative terms. Then, as shown in Chapter 5, the ambipolar electric field component parallel to B is given by E || = ( 1 / n e q e ) ∇ || p e (9.2) Remember that since q e is a negative number, E || is opposite in direction to ∇ || p e ; that is, E || points upward in the topside ionosphere. If we now let s be measured opposite to the magnetic field, the component of the equation of motion in the s direction for the j th ion species in the Northern Hemisphere is V js ( ∂ V js ∂ s ) + 1 n e m j ∂ p e ∂ s + 1 n j m j ∂ p j ∂ s − ( g · ˆ B ) + ∑ j \u0005= k ν jk ( V js − V ks ) = 0 (9.3) Inspection of (9.3) reveals the forces acting on a minor ion. From right to left they arise from friction brought about by collisions with the other ion species, the component of gravity along the magnetic field, the partial pressure gradient in the minor ion species itself, and the ambipolar electric field generated between the electrons and the major ions. The final term on the left is the advective derivative. The upward electric force must ultimately become small as the light ions become the dominant species. Then on closed magnetic field lines the light ion plasma can approach or attain a state of quasi-diffusive and hydrodynamic equilibrium. While this situation can occur along the relatively short, closed mag- netic field lines that exist in the midlatitude ionosphere, it may not be achievable along the open or highly distended field lines in the high-latitude ionosphere. A continuous outward flow of the minor light ions, H + and He + , can therefore occur at either subsonic or supersonic velocities in a manner consistent with the forces. A description of this ion motion can be obtained by considering the equations of continuity, motion, and energy for each species. These equations make up a closed system that is generally solved numerically (see Schunk, 1977, and Schunk and Nagy, 2000, for a full description of these equations), given a boundary condition at the top of the ionosphere near 3000 km. If we apply some simplifying assumptions, however, a description of the fundamental physics that is operating can be obtained. Consider the motion of a minor ion species, j , embedded in a major ion species, i , where the i th species is in diffusive equilibrium in an"},{"pageNumber":445,"pageContent":"Ionospheric Response to Electric Fields 437 isothermal topside ionosphere. In such a case the electron and major ion gas is distributed along the magnetic field tube according to the expression n e = n e 0 exp [ − ( s − s 0 )/ H p ] , (9.4) where n e 0 is the electron density at some reference altitude s 0 , H p is the plasma scale height, and the variation of gravity with altitude has been neglected (Rishbeth and Garriott, 1969). The pressure for each species may be written as p j = n j k B T j . If we also assume that the altitude is sufficiently high for neutral collisions to be neglected, the minor ions collide only with the major ions and (9.3) can be rewritten as ν ji V js + V js ( ∂ V js ∂ s ) = ( g · ˆ B ) + ( k B T e m j H p ) − ( k B T j m j )( 1 n j )( ∂ n j ∂ s ) (9.5) where we allow T e \u0005= T i or T j but do not allow variation with altitude. Neglecting the perpendicular motion of the plasma, the steady-state continuity equation for species j can be written from (2.22a) in the form A ( P j − L j ) = (∂/∂ s )( An j V js ) (9.6) where A is the cross-sectional area of a magnetic flux tube, P j is the production term, and L j is the loss term. Integrating this equation along the magnetic flux tube from the reference altitude to any point s ,wefind ( 1 / Q j )(∂ Q j /∂ s ) = ( 1 / n j )(∂ n j /∂ s ) + ( 1 / V js )(∂ V js /∂ s ) + ( 1 / A )(∂ A /∂ s ) (9.7) where Q j = s ∫ s 0 A ( P j − L j ) ds (9.8) Substituting for ( 1 / n j )(∂ n j /∂ s ) in (9.5), we arrive finally at the equation ( V 2 js − V 2 t ) ( 1 / V js )(∂ V js /∂ s ) =− ν ji V js + g · ˆ B − ( k B T e / m j H p ) − V 2 t [ ( 1 / Q j )(∂ Q j /∂ s ) − ( 1 / A )(∂ A /∂ s ) ] , (9.9) where the thermal speed of the j th species is given by V t = ( k B T j / m j ) 1 / 2 .

This point is commonly called the supersonic transition in fluid theory.

Figure 9.2 shows the family of solutions for (9.9), using the hydrogen Mach number M j = V js / V t plotted as a function of altitude. The physi- cally meaningful solutions are those with M j > 1 at all altitudes and one solution (marked as curve A) passing through the transitional point at M j = 1 for which the flow is subsonic at low altitudes and supersonic at higher altitudes. A simi- lar analysis has been done for the solar wind in the pioneering work by Parker (1958). The solutions of these hydrodynamic equations are now sophisticated enough that the details of heat transfer and energy balance may be considered in addition to the momentum and density distribution of various ion species. In such models the acceleration of minor ion species with mass less than the mean ion mass can occur in which ion-ion collisions are sufficient to produce frictional heating and anisotropic ion temperatures. In the high-latitude ionosphere, both H + and He + can be accelerated through the O + gas and be subjected to this heating process. The existence of different temperatures and temperature distributions in the ion species can induce motion in these species that (depending on the ion mass) either resists or assists their outward flow. 3.0 2.5 2.0 Mach number ( M \u0002 u / c ) H \u0003 IN O \u0003 , O, H, O 2 , N 2 T e \u0002 T i \u0002 3000 \u0004 K T n \u0002 1000 \u0004 K 1.5 A A 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.2 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 Altitude (10 3 km) 6.0 7.0 8.0 10.0 9.0 Figure 9.2 Solutions of the hydrodynamic equations for the hydrogen ion Mach number as a function of altitude in a gas containing O + ions as well as the neutral species O, H, O 2 , and N 2 .

The curves labeled (a)–(h) correspond to assumed H + outflow velocities at 3000 km ranging from 0 to about 20 km/s. [After Raitt et al. (1975). Reproduced with permission of Pergamon Press.] Figure 9.3 shows some typical results of calculations performed assuming dif- ferent outflow velocities for H + at 3000 km. Notice in Fig. 9.3b that the H + velocity increases rapidly in the region between 600 and 1400 km where O + is the dominant ion (see Fig. 9.3a). This flow is induced by the O + -electron polarization field. The flow of H + through O + produces frictional heating of the H + gas to temperatures above that of the O + ions in this region. At higher altitudes the distribution of the species is controlled by the specified H + outflow velocity, that is, by the boundary condition placed on the solution. It shows that, at 3000 km, the predicted H + polar wind can be supersonic since velocities in excess of 10 km/s are associated with temperatures less than 4000 K. Two important considerations should be kept in mind when considering the usefulness of this hydrodynamic description of the polar wind. First, the polar wind does not simply result from an open field-line geometry of field tubes with very large volumes. The minor ions H + and He + , for example, receive very little"},{"pageNumber":448,"pageContent":"440 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics acceleration if the electron population is very cold, as it might be in the winter polar region. Second, the theoretical descriptions of the polar wind are dependent on some boundary condition that is usually applied at the top of the modeled region near 3000 km, where the ionosphere becomes essentially collisionless. The effects of the acceleration processes and the distribution of the ion species below this altitude are dependent on their boundary conditions. Ultimately, boundary conditions must be consistent with conditions in the outer magnetosphere, where the field tubes are in contact with a much lower-density plasma having a variety of possible energy distributions that differ significantly from those existing at lower altitudes. 9.2 Ionospheric Effects of Perpendicular Plasma Dynamics 9.2.1 The Role of Horizontal Transport In Chapter 8 we described in some detail the convective motion of the ionospheric plasma that results from an electric field of solar wind origin. The large-scale convection pattern at high latitudes is fixed with respect to the earth-sun line and the magnetic dipole axis. In this coordinate system the convection pattern is dependent on latitude and longitude (also referred to as magnetic local time). The plasma moves both toward and away from the sun and into and out of the auroral zone. Since the solar radiation and auroral particle precipitation are the most important ionization sources, the plasma convection velocity is thus one of the most important factors affecting the plasma distribution and temperature at all altitudes. In addition to the ionospheric motion imposed from the magnetosphere, the earth’s atmosphere and portions of its plasma environment corotate about the geographic axis. We thus have a rather complicated situation in which one source of motion and ionization is most easily specified in a geographic reference frame and another is most easily specified in a geomagnetic reference frame. During the course of a day the geomagnetic pole rotates around the geographic pole and, in a coordinate system fixed with respect to the sun, there is therefore a universal time dependence (in addition to latitude and local time dependence) in both the magnetospheric convection velocity and the auroral zone ionization rate. At high latitudes the relatively high ion velocities produce frictional heating due to collisions between the ions and the neutral gas. These collisions also affect the rate at which ions recombine with the neutral gas. We will deal with these collisional effects later. We will not deal in detail with the production and loss processes for plasma in the ionosphere but we will describe the convection effects in sufficient detail that their effects on the plasma composition, distribution, and temperature will be recognized. To understand the net plasma distribution at high latitudes, we will consider a frame of reference in which the earth-sun line and the geographic pole are fixed. This frame is essentially fixed in inertial space since its motion, consisting"},{"pageNumber":449,"pageContent":"Ionospheric Response to Electric Fields 441 of rotation around the sun once per year, is negligible compared to the con- vective motion of the plasma during a one-day cycle. In this reference frame the plasma has a corotation component that is independent of local time and a magnetospheric component that is dependent on local time and universal time as the magnetic pole rotates around the geographic pole. Figure 9.4 shows sev- eral different plasma convection paths resulting from this complex addition of corotation and magnetospheric convection. Each path is traced for a 24-hour period to illustrate that the paths do not necessarily close and are certainly quite different from the convection paths illustrated in Chapter 8, in which the motion of the coordinate system was removed. The starting points for these three trajec- tories may be roughly summarized as follows: (a) dusk convection cell, (b) polar cap, and (c) dawn convection cell. Also shown in each portion of the figure is the position of the solar terminator in the Northern Hemisphere during winter, summer, and equinox. Notice in this inertial frame that the plasma can move in and out of sunlight as well as in and out of the auroral zone. A complex distribu- tion of plasma production, transport, and loss, having local time and universal time dependences, results from this motion. With the goal of understanding some of the consequences of this plasma motion, we will consider some large-scale features observed in the high-latitude F region. Figure 9.5 shows the total plasma concentration and the perpendicular components of the plasma drift velocity observed by a satellite traversing the high-latitude ionosphere. The plot is made in a rotating frame such that a coro- tating plasma would register zero velocity. In the time interval labeled B, the zonal flow velocity indicated by the upper curve is weak and to the west. At the point where the curve crosses the dashed line, the plasma is flowing toward the west with the same velocity at which the earth is rotating toward the east at that latitude. This means that the dusk terminator is moving westward at the same velocity as the plasma, and thus, the plasma sees solar conditions that are independent of time.

Examination of the plasma drift characteristics within the premidnight trough in Fig. 9.5 shows that the plasma depletion lies within a region in which there is a transition from either eastward or corotating plasma drift equatorward of the auroral zone to westward drift in the auroral zone. At such a transition zone the plasma flows very slowly, and chemical recombination will have more time to reduce the ion concentration than in regions where the plasma moves more quickly or where auroral zone ionization exists. Figure 9.6 shows a schematic diagram of a modeled set of convection paths in the evening trough region that are similar to the data shown in Fig. 9.7. On the right-hand side the results of a simple chemical decay model are given for the plasma content, taking into account its motion along these paths. The results confirm that plasma stagnation in the nighttime region just equatorward of the auroral zone is a likely candidate for the quiet-time trough formation. We discuss the storm-time trough in Chapter 10. The convection paths giving rise to the trough in the premidnight sector result quite naturally from adding the essentially eastward corotation, dominating the flow characteristics at low latitudes, and the essentially westward flow from the magnetospheric field, dominating the flow characteristics at high latitudes. Figure 9.7 shows the results of adding these two convection sources in a magnetic coordinate frame. In this figure the premidnight trough results from the very slow flow in the nighttime region of the trajectory labeled II. The illustrated flow pattern, of course, has considerable variations because of the universal time effects mentioned earlier and the temporal changes in the magnetospheric electric field.

Note however that a midlatitude trough is observed in regions other than the premidnight sector, so it is unlikely that the slow flow convection trajectories described here are the only source of trough formation. At other local times the midlatitude trough may be due to low plasma densities produced elsewhere and transported to the observation region in the complex flow pattern produced by the offset between the dipole axis and the earth’s rotation axis. The rather simple concept of opposing flows from corotation and magneto- spheric sources that can account for the premidnight trough also pertains inside the polar cap in the postmidnight sector. In the winter season the antisunward flow in the postmidnight region of the polar cap takes place in darkness and is directed approximately to the west. This flow is opposed by the eastward corotation velocity and, therefore, at certain longitudes and universal times can produce plasma stagnation. In the dark polar cap there are very few sources of ionization, and, thus, we might expect a plasma depletion to occur in a similar manner to the midlatitude trough. Figure 9.8 shows the maximum and minimum O + concentrations in the southern winter hemisphere. These observations, made on an Atmospheric Explorer satellite near 300 km altitude, clearly show the mid- latitude trough in the O + concentration and, as discussed above, a large plasma depletion at latitudes above the auroral zone in the postmidnight polar cap.

This occurrence pattern can easily be attributed to the movement of the solar terminator, which places this location always in dark- ness in the winter, partially in darkness at equinox, and completely in sunlight during the summer. Figure 9.9 summarizes some characteristics of the total ion concentration and its relationships to a typical high-latitude convection pattern. 9.2.2 Ion Heating Due to Collisions When ionic and neutral particles collide, the amount of energy exchanged depends on the relative velocity between the two particles. At high latitudes this relative velocity can become quite high due to the magnetospheric convection electric field. Then this energy exchange can significantly affect the ion temper- ature, the ion composition, and even the neutral wind. The ion temperature at high latitudes is determined principally by frictional heating, which occurs whenever a relative velocity exists between the ion and neutral gases, and by heat exchange with the neutral gas and electron gas. The former can be described equally well as Joule heating due to the Pedersen current"},{"pageNumber":454,"pageContent":"446 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics 18 6 12 50 8 60 8 70 8 0 MLT 80 8 Hole Main Q 5 1 Trough Auroral Oval C o r o t a t i o n Figure 9.9 The plasma stagnation that may produce the depletions seen in Fig. 9.8 occur when the magnetospheric convection pattern and the corotation velocity are combined, as shown here.

When all of these effects are considered, the ion temperature can be expressed as (St.-Maurice and Hanson, 1982): T i = T eq + ( m n φ in / 3 k B φ in ) | V i − V n | 2 (9.11) where T eq = T n + [ ( m i + m n )ν ie / m i ν in φ in ] ( T e − T i ). (9.12) Here the dimensionless parameters φ in and φ in depend on the nature of the colli- sional interactions between the ions and the neutral gas, but above about 200 km, where O + collides principally with atomic oxygen, both of these parameters are approximately unity. These expressions show that the ion temperature will increase from its equilib- rium value whenever a relative velocity exists between the ion and neutral gases.

Keep in mind, however, that such a correlation can occur only when the neutral gas velocity is much smaller than the ion velocity. At high latitudes the same ion-neutral collisions that produce frictional heating of the ion gas also tend to set the neutral gas in motion, leading to an equalization of the ion and neutral velocities in a steady state. When this occurs, the ion gas can be moving quite rapidly with almost no frictional heating. Figure 9.11 shows such an event where the ion temperature maintains its equi- librium value throughout a region of antisunward flow where the ion velocity is in excess of 1 km/s. In this example, simultaneous measurement of the neutral gas velocity shows that it is also moving at high speed and in the same direction as the ions. The momentum transfer between the plasma and the neutral gas is described in more detail in Section 9.3. As we shall see, if the high-latitude ion convection pattern remains stable for several hours, then the ion-neutral colli- sions can, in fact, set up a similar convection pattern in the neutral gas. However, if we see evidence of frictional heating in the high-latitude polar cap region, as shown in Fig. 9.10, then it is reasonable to conclude that the observed ion con- vection pattern has been established within the last hour or two and the neutrals are not yet moving with the same velocity as the ions. 4000 Ions Neutrals DE-2 1161 81294 Orbit Date 500 m/s Ap 33 Kp 5 1 2000 0 1.E9 1.E8 1.E7 200 100 0 UT ALT LAT 8733 367 2 75.2 8983 337 2 88.1 9233 327 2 71.4 9483 339 2 54.6 9733 373 2 37.8 (secs) (km) (deg) (Mins) 1.E5 1.E6 (cm 2 3 ) 1.E7 (K) T e T i T n ne n (0) n (N 2 ) \u0002 ni Figure 9.11 Under stable conditions the ion and neutral velocities can become compa- rable, as observed in the polar cap here by DE-2.

This is particularly true in the ionospheric F region, where the rates for the charge exchange reactions are extremely sensitive to the relative energy of the reacting particles. If these rates are enhanced, then the plasma density will decrease since NO + and O + 2 recombine quite rapidly because of dissociative recombination. The plasma ion composition will also change if O + is converted to molecular species via the reactions O + + N 2 → NO + + N ( with rate k 1 ) (9.13a) O + + O 2 → O + 2 + O ( with rate k 2 ) (9.13b) Laboratory studies of these reactions express their rates in terms of an effective temperature. The experiments are performed by passing one gas through the other in a drift tube in a manner quite similar to the drift of ions through the neutrals in the ionosphere. The most important reaction rate in the F region is the ion-atom exchange between O + and N 2 . The rate coefficient of this reaction can be written in the form k 1 = [ 1 . 53 × 10 − 12 − 5 . 92 × 10 − 13 ( T eff / 300 ) + 8 . 6 × 10 − 14 ( T eff / 300 ) 2 ] cm 3 / s , T eff = 0 . 636 T i + 0 . 364 T n . To determine the effective temperature for the ionosphere, we must take into account the relative velocity of the neutral gas with respect to the ions. If we then express the relative ion-neutral velocity in terms of the electric field in the neutral frame such that | V i ⊥ − U ⊥ |= E \b ⊥ / B , then the effective temperature is given by T eff = T i + 0 . 33 E \b 2 ⊥ (9.14) where E \b ⊥ is expressed in millivolts per meter (Schunk et al., 1975). We see, therefore, that the rate coefficient, k 1 , increases strongly with the ion-neutral velocity difference. This highly sensitive variation in the charge exchange rate can be reflected quite dramatically, both in the absolute ion concentration and in the relative ion composition at high latitudes.

Hanson.) at least an order of magnitude over NO + for almost the entire pass. In regions of large drift, however, we observe an increase in the relative concentration of NO + and a decrease in the total ion concentration. The decrease in total ion concentration is due to the very rapid recombination of NO + . 9.2.4 Positive and Negative Ionospheric Storms Energy, momentum, and Joule heating in the high latitude ionosphere all con- tribute to what are known as ionospheric storms. As the names indicate, ionospheric plasma densities at midlatitudes may be higher or lower than the norm in various phases of the magnetic storms, which are the primary context in which ionospheric storms are described. The term ionospheric storm refers to global ionospheric effects as opposed to Convective Equatorial Ionospheric Storms (CEIS), described in Chapter 4, and that are confined to the low latitude sector. Positive storms can be due to a variety of mechanisms (Fuller-Rowell and Rees, 1981; Huang et al., 2005). Strong neutral winds blowing equatorward out of the high latitude zone will tend to push plasma away from the earth"},{"pageNumber":459,"pageContent":"Ionospheric Response to Electric Fields 451 and its neutral atmosphere along the magnetic field lines. This in turn reduces recombination of O + , which requires interaction with a neutral molecule for efficient recombination, thereby increasing the plasma density. Similarly, pene- trating zonally eastward electric fields associated with an increase in the dawn- to-dusk interplanetary electric field in the earth’s reference frame (IMF B z south conditions) causes an uplift of the daytime equatorial ionosphere, removing ions from the recombination zone and allowing for further production of plasma in sunlight. This uplift eventually leads to an enhanced fountain effect and an expan- sion of the equatorial anomaly (equatorial arcs) to higher latitudes. If, in turn, this plasma is ripped away from the midlatitude zone by meridional penetrating fields, a SED (Storm Enhanced Density) event may occur, leading to channels of dense plasma stretching even over the polar zone (Foster and Burke, 2002; Vlasov et al., 2003; Foster et al., 2005). Negative storms are thought to be due to changes in the composition of the neutral atmosphere at thermosphere/ionosphere heights. This in turn is due to heating and upwelling of the lower atmosphere with its molecular-rich compo- sition. In turn, this decreases the [O]/[N 2 ] ratio and enhances the recombination of the O + plasma, resulting in a negative ionospheric storm. The molecular-rich atmosphere can be transported for vast distances by disturbance winds (Fuller- Rowell and Rees, 1981). Large scale TIDs can also affect the density as the associated oscillating winds drive the ionosphere into the neutral atmosphere in one phase, decreasing the local density, while in the equatorward wind phase, to first order, the plasma merely rises without changing its content, something of a half-wave rectifier effect. 9.3 Electrodynamic Forcing of the Neutral Atmosphere 9.3.1 J × B Forcing The fact that the plasma is often in motion with high velocities in the polar region has important consequences for thermospheric dynamics. We cannot hope to treat this fascinating topic in the detail it deserves but will only outline some of its most important aspects. In Chapters 3 and 5 we pointed out that the plasma acts as a drag on the thermosphere at low and midlatitudes. We showed that this drag force was equivalent to a J × B force on the neutral gas where J = σ · ( U × B ). If this current is not divergence free, we found that electric fields build up and usually reduce the total current with the result that the J × B force decreases. Neutral winds in such a case therefore create electric fields via a dynamo process."},{"pageNumber":460,"pageContent":"452 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics At high latitudes, the electric fields are impressed from outside the ionosphere/ thermosphere system and the possibility for a motor arises. In fact, the origin of the force on the neutrals is again the J × B force, only in the high-latitude case the expression J = σ · ( E + U × B ) is usually dominated by the impressed electric field, E . In the F region, where the conductivity tensor σ is diagonal, the force becomes F = σ p E \b × B where E \b is the electric field in the neutral frame of reference. A data set taken in the evening auroral oval, which shows the importance of electrodynamic forcing, is presented in Fig. 9.13a and b. Figure 9.13a is an all-sky camera picture showing the location of several chemical releases made from the same rocket. The rocket was launched from Poker Flat, Alaska, at 1810 local time on February 28, 1978. Figure 9.13b is a schematic diagram that describes the various features in the photograph. The two visible barium (Ba) ion clouds have been driven by the E × B drift at high velocity toward the west, since E was the usual northward electric field at that time period. The two circular strontium (Sr) neutral clouds have hardly moved since their release (which was at the same time and altitude ( ≥ 200 km) as the ion clouds). However, the trimethyl aluminum (TMA) trail shows a high-velocity region streaming in the same direction as the ion cloud at about one-third the plasma cloud velocity. More quantitative data from the same experiment are given in Fig. 9.14. The three solid tracks in the figure show sequential locations of the barium ion clouds and are labeled I205, I268, and I214, corresponding to the three ion (I) cloud altitudes in kilometers. Minute markers show the temporal progression of the three clouds, which moved parallel to the auroral oval at about 1 km/s. The two dashed lines marked N131 and N140 show the neutral (N) trail locations at the peak in the two neutral velocity profiles, which occurred at 131 and 140 km, respectively. Notice that the southern trail moved very nearly parallel to the E × B direction with a velocity equal to about 27% of the velocity of the ion cloud nearest in horizontal location. The northern trail had a speed equal to 44% of the nearest ion cloud velocity and a direction rotated slightly poleward of the E × B velocity. The high-altitude neutral clouds (N210, N278, and N209) moved much more slowly and had a considerably different direction of motion from the E × B direction. Some of these results may be explained in a straightforward manner. First, note that since the E field maps uniformly with altitude, the main altitude dependence in F is in the σ P term. The simultaneous Chatanika radar data showed that this term (primarily due to σ P ) peaked at 140 km altitude, in excellent agreement with the observed peaks in the neutral wind profiles.

Now, since ν in is proportional to the neutral density n n , the latter cancels out, and we have the interesting result that the neutral acceleration depends only on the plasma density n . Using ν in ∼ = 5 × 10 − 10 n n (see Appendix B), we can estimate the time for acceleration to a velocity, δ u = ( 1 / 3 )( E / B ) ,tobe δ t 1 / 3 ∼ = 10 10 / 15 n .

Viscosity is particularly important in the dynamics since it spreads the strong height-dependent J × B forcing to other alti- tudes. Mikkelsen et al. (1981a, b) have studied this event with a two-dimensional numerical model using the local forcing deduced from the radar and rocket data. They found good agreement with the calculated and observed zonal wind (see Fig. 9.15). Their model included the pressure gradient, a curvature effect due to the shape of the auroral oval and advection of momentum in the vertical and meridional directions. The agreement was not quite as good between the observations and the model wind in the meridional component. Furthermore, when applied to a second data set, obtained three days later on March 2, 1978, the agreement was poor in both components. The primary difference in the two events was the location of the forcing in longitude. In the February 28 data, shown in Figs. 9.13–9.15, a substorm occurred near College, Alaska, and local forcing was an adequate approximation. On March 2, however, the sub- storm was far to the east of College. Since the observed winds were very similar, Mikkelsen et al. concluded that advection of momentum in the zonal direction was crucial and that a three-dimensional model was essential for progress in understanding electrodynamic forcing of the upper atmosphere. 250 200 Altitude (km) Observations Model integration 150 Northern trail Southern trail 100 Zonal wind (m/s) Zonal wind (m/s) 2 300 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 2 300 2 200 2 100 0 100 200 Figure 9.15 Comparison of the observed zonal wind profiles at the northern and south- ern positions on February 28 with the results of the modeling.

(Figure courtesy of M. Conde.) Developments in optical technology now permit Doppler shift measurements of thermospheric winds at up to 48 different locations in an all-sky image. This “all-sky Fabry-Perot” instrument has shown remarkable variability in the neutral wind near auroral features. Figure 9.16 shows just such winds via arrows super- posed on an all-sky image obtained during a magnetic substorm. In the period of 0813–0906 nT (evening over Alaska), very sizeable thermospherc winds were blowing parallel to the auroral oval. This is similar to the conditions in Figs. 9.13–9.15 and likely represents ion drag in a region of sunward plasma convection. But as the substorm developed, the wind rotated toward the south- west. This change most likely was due to a combination of change in the pressure gradients due to Joule heating and ion drag due to antisunward convection closer to magnetic midnight. We simply do not understand neutral/plasma interactions on our own planet. 9.3.2 Global Observations and Simulations Heppner and Miller (1982) collected a number of barium neutral cloud measure- ments in the thermosphere and compared them to several convection models.

The wind locations were arbitrarily shifted by two hours to take into account the sluggish response of the neutrals (e.g., see the preceding calculation of δ t ). The vectors show a much clearer relationship to the ion flow in Fig. 9.17b. One obvious difference between the plasma flow and the measured winds, even in Fig. 9.17b, is that the strong neutral flow seems to continue at latitudes well below the auroral oval. This occurs because there is no comparable force to “turn” the neutral wind when the flow leaves the sunward convection part of the two-celled plasma flow pattern. Notice that something of a flywheel effect will occur in this case since the wind in the subauroral region can create electric fields via the F region dynamo process discussed in Chapters 3 and 5. This effect has been suggested by Gonzales et al. (1978) to explain some of the anomalous midlatitude electric field observations in the evening sector (see Chapter 5). Although the primary electrodynamic effect seems to be momentum transfer via the J × B force, changes in pressure due to Joule heating of the neutral gas discussed in Section 9.2 also affect the neutral atmospheric dynamics. This effect may be more important in producing vertical upwelling and neutral composition changes than in generating strong neutral winds. Three-dimensional models of neutral wind forcing due to realistic electric field patterns are now available that include all of the important physical processes.

Models such as those discussed here will prove quite valuable in developing further insights into the electrodynamic forcing of the neutral atmosphere. 9.4 Particle Acceleration in the Topside Ionosphere Remarkably, the earth’s topside ionosphere is a powerful particle accelerator. This is manifested most obviously by one of nature’s most spectacular phenom- ena: the aurora. We can only hope to scratch the surface of ion and electron acceleration phenomena in this text but at least some introduction is possible. 9.4.1 Parallel Electric Fields in the Upper Ionosphere Low-altitude rocket experiments gave the first evidence for the existence of large parallel electric fields via observations of anticorrelated electron and ion fluxes (Mozer and Bruston, 1966) and mono-energetic electron spectra peaked at 6 keV (Evans, 1968). The first definitive detection came from observation of upward barium ion acceleration using shaped, charged injections (Haerendel et al., 1976) and from in situ parallel electric field observations from a satellite (Mozer et al., 1977).

The velocity change corresponds to passage through an acceleration zone where E points upwards antiparallel to B in the Northern Hemisphere. Such fields are unexpected due to the high conductivity parallel to the magnetic field. Early theories appealed to anomalous resistivity supported by ion acoustic or ion cyclotron waves. The idea was that the electrons would collide with waves rather than other particles, creating an effective collision frequency, ν ∗ . Then σ ∗ = ne 2 / m ν ∗ would decrease, allowing E || = J || /σ ∗ 0 to become large. This is an attractive idea since both ion cyclotron and ion acoustic waves are unstable to large J || (Kindel and Kennel, 1971). Another attraction was that the plasma density decreases faster than does the area of the magnetic flux tube. Thus, for a given J || = neV d , where V d is the parallel differential drift of ions and electrons, V d can become quite large a few thousand kilometers above the auroral ionosphere. When V d exceeds the electron thermal speed, the plasma is unstable; that is, for V d = J || ne > V th e (9.15)"},{"pageNumber":469,"pageContent":"Ionospheric Response to Electric Fields 461 where V th e is the electron thermal velocity, the plasma is unstable to generation of Langmuir waves. This is the instability threshold for T e = T i , but for T e \u000b T i , the plasma is unstable for V 2 d > C 2 s = k ( T e + T i ) M (9.16) where C s is the ion acoustic speed. This threshold is much lower than (9.15). In this case, sound waves are generated and could lead to an anomalous resistivity. However, it turns out that many other exotic plasma processes occur around and even below this threshold and it seems very likely that other nonlinear phe- nomena dominate the physics before anomalous resistivity comes into play. We cannot hope to do this nonlinear physics justice but end this section with data from the FAST satellite, illustrating the complexity of the parallel electric field acceleration zone (Frey et al., 2001).

These parallel electric field components are accompanied by the large (nearly 1 V/m) perpendicular electric fields illustrated in the figure. As indi- cated by the closed potential contours, these large perpendicular fields do not map to the ionosphere below. Ions are accelerated in opposite directions by the parallel electric field. It is important to note in these figures that J || and E || are such that J || · E || > 0. Applying to Poynting’s theorem, consider a volume capped above the accelera- tion zone and below the E region and with sides parallel to B . Since the current closes in the E region, no Poynting flux escapes and the Poynting flux into the top must be equal to the Joule dissipation somewhere inside the volume. An interesting way to think about the auroral acceleration zone, then, is as follows. For some modest level of Poynting flux at the top, the ionospheric dissipation J · E \b = σ P | E \b | 2 can cope with the input. In a sunlit ionosphere this is possible, since \t p is many mhos. At night some drizzle precipitation can also keep \t p elevated. But as the magnetosphere increases its energy input, something must give. Generation of a finite parallel electric field at high altitude has two great advantages for satisfying the energy dissipation needed by the system: 1. if J · E > 0 exists in regions other than the E region and electrical energy is directly converted into mechanical energy in another volume; and 2. the resulting downward accelerated electrons increase \t p in the E region where Joule dissipation can increase. As shown by both the barium ion injection experiments mentioned above and the satellite particle detectors (Shelley et al., 1976), ions are accelerated upward into the magnetosphere by the same E || accelerating electrons downward. This is an important ionospheric source of O + ions for magnetospheric plasma, which was thought to be entirely made up of H + ions for many years. In the next section we describe other sources of ionospheric particle injection into the mag- netosphere, beginning at lower altitudes where O + is more prevalent. 9.4.2 Ion Outflows and Perpendicular Ion Acceleration An important source of mass and energetic ions for the magnetosphere originates in the auroral F-region ionosphere. There appears to be three mechanisms for transporting energetic ions upward. Type 1 upflows are friction driven and oper- ate in the presence of strong convection and ion-neutral collisions (St.-Maurice and Schunk, 1979). Evidence for this kind of upflow exists from satellite obser- vations (St.-Maurice et al., 1976) and from ISR EISCAT observations (Lock- wood et al., 1987). Type 2 ion upflows are always found in association with soft electron precipitation. In this case the soft electron precipitation heats the F region electron gas, which expands upward, carrying the ions along through an ambipolar electric field (Wahlund and Opgenoorth, 1989; Wahlund et al., 1992). In both cases the upflow is driven by a change in scale height of either the ion or electron gas and the observed upflow is at the transition between regions"},{"pageNumber":471,"pageContent":"Ionospheric Response to Electric Fields 463 with two different scale heights. Since the gravitational binding energy of O + is about 9 eV, heating either the electron or ion gas to even a few eV will not eject O + into the magnetosphere. In fact, downflow due to a transition to a smaller ionospheric scale height is also observed. Surveys of ion outflow below 1000 km have been performed using DE-2 (Loranc et al., 1991) and Hi-Lat (Tsunoda et al., 1989). The Loranc et al. study focused on the altitude range of 200–800 km altitude. They confirmed the prenoon cleft/cusp as the largest source of ion fluxes and found upward fluxes capable of supplying the cleft ion fountain. They also found upward drift velocities exceeding 250 m/s at altitudes above 600 km and smaller upward drift velocities at lower altitudes. The Tsunoda et al. study examined 76 orbits of Hi-Lat observations at 800 km altitude and found the mean ion outflow velocity to be 700 m/s. Furthermore, their events were characterized by upward field- aligned currents; intense, soft electron precipitation; and convection velocity shears. The DE-2 data were re-examined by Seo et al. (1997) in the altitude range of 850–950 km to investigate the details of ionospheric plasma param- eters and soft electron precipitation. They found that the upward ion velocity correlated best with electron temperature ( r = 0 . 97) and less well with ion tem- perature ( r = 0 . 91), where r is the correlation coefficients. They concluded that soft electron precipitation and the associated electron heating, expansion, and ambipolar electric field were the most common sources for ion outflow, but that frictional heating contributes as well. The third source of hot O + ions is wave-induced ion acceleration associated with field-aligned currents. This mechanism is easily identified by the existence of transversely accelerated ions, sometimes referred to as ion conics. The full analysis involves plasma physics beyond the scope of this text but a few comments are in order. Figure 9.22 shows rocket data from a flight over the dayside auroral zone (P. M. Kintner, personal communication, 2002). The rocket was launched from Norway, overflew the island of Spitzbergen, and landed in the Arctic Ocean. Initially the rocket was located on field lines that threaded the plasma sheet and which are most likely closed deep in the tail of the magnetosphere. This region is characterized by the 1–5 keV electron fluxes in the upper panel. Abruptly the payload enters the region of highly structured, intense 0.2–1 keV electrons and energetic ions that originated in the magnetosheath, the shocked dayside solar wind that connects directly to the ionosphere in the cusp. In the expanded plots below, we see intense O + ,H + , and low frequency plasma waves in this region. Even the O + ions in this region are energetic enough to escape earth’s gravitational pull. Furthermore, these field lines are swept over the polar cap and the oxygen ions certainly become part of the magnetosphere. This region is very likely a significant source of magnetospheric ions, many of which are oxygen. The clear correlation of energized ions and low frequency waves shown in the lower panel suggests ion energization by waves. Current thinking is that a com- bination of ion acoustic, lower hybrid, and ion cyclotron waves are responsible for this energization. The latter two waves, in particular, preferentially accelerate"},{"pageNumber":472,"pageContent":"464 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics SCIFER (40.006 IE) Electrons Ions Oxygen Protons VLF12 Energy (keV) Energy (eV) 15.8 4.2 0.2 0.005 1 750 230 15 6 Fight Time (s) Fight Time (s) 300 500 700 900 1100 730 750 770 790 810 830 894 1305 1452 1346 979 Altitude (km) 50 Energy (eV) 194 63 9 6 20 Energy (eV) 194 63 9 6 20 Energy (eV) 2.0 1.5 0.5 0 1.0 Figure 9.22 Panel 1: Flight overview of electrons from 0.005 to 15.8 keV.

Knowledge of the current and prior convective history of the plasma and the magnetic field topology encountered by that plasma is essential to understanding or explaining many phenomena. When considering plasma near the F peak, the local solar zenith angle, the time at which the flux tube encountered the auroral ionization source, the spa- tial variation of the drift velocity along the convection path, and the length of time the drift allows the plasma to reside in a production region must all be taken into account. The magnetic field topology is a minor consideration. The midlatitude trough, for example, can be understood in this manner. Above the F peak, the magnetic field topology is an important consideration, as is the plasma temperature. They will both affect the field-aligned motion of the plasma and its topside distribution. The light ion trough can be understood with these considerations. Progress toward a more complete understanding of the high- latitude ionospheric plasma will undoubtedly require multipoint measurements that provide some information about the time history of the plasma motion and the ionization sources it encounters. Some data sets of this nature are available from simultaneous measurements made by rockets, satellites, and ground-based instrumentation, but they must be integrated into a study that includes a versatile computer model in order to sort out the most important processes. At the top of the ionosphere, dramatic particle acceleration zones exist. At 500- 1000 km, ions are transversely accelerated far beyond escape speed, supplying the magnetosphere with hot oxygen ions. Above this height, near 5000 km, both ions and electrons are accelerated by parallel electric fields, forming the classic electron-induced aurora and precipitating oxygen ions and protons. The upward parallel fields also expel hot ions into the magnetosphere and create “black” aurora. The effect of plasma dynamics on the neutral atmosphere can also be quite dramatic. Numerous measurements have shown extremely strong winds in the high-latitude thermosphere. Simultaneous plasma velocity measurements show clearly that these winds are driven by electric fields that are impressed from above through interactions between the earth’s magnetosphere and the solar wind. This control of the earth’s upper atmosphere by interplanetary processes is a fascinating example of the interaction between a flowing plasma and a planetary atmosphere. References Banks, P.

Our primary interest lies in the hor- izontal variation of plasma density and electric fields. Since the magnetic field is nearly vertical, the horizontal structure is equivalent to variations perpendicular to the magnetic field. We use the generic term structure , since terms such as waves or plasma density irregularities conjure up specific sources. In fact, a very long list of processes contributes to the generation of horizontal structures in the plasma den- sity and velocity field of the high-latitude ionosphere. It is essentially impossible to treat the topic in its entirety, since our understanding is developing very quickly. Our hope instead is to give a reasonable hint at the breadth of the phenomena involved and, within the various subtopics, to treat a few important processes in some detail. As was the case in earlier chapters, we start with the F region and follow with the E region in the second portion of the chapter. 10.1 Planetary and Large-Scale Structures in the High-Latitude F Region In this section we review the physical processes that create horizontal variations in the high-latitude plasma density at the largest scales. We somewhat arbitrarily define the planetary scale to be larger than 500 km and large-scale processes to have perpendicular wavelengths in the range 30 km ≤ λ ≤ 500 km. In these regimes production, loss, and transport dominate the ionospheric processes. Ionospheric plasma instabilities are not very important in this scale size regime (although some local ionospheric processes do contribute at the lower end). Of course, this is not to say that magnetospheric plasma instabilities are unimportant, since they control some of the precipitation and turbulence in the flow patterns which are impressed on the ionosphere. Detailed study of the associated magnetospheric physics is beyond the scope of the present text, although we do refer in passing to some of the most important processes that occur.

We briefly summarize the material here for completeness. The velocity field applied to the ionosphere from the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction has a number of discernible patterns at planetary scales. However, which of these patterns applies at a given time is highly dependent on conditions in the interplanetary medium. The most crucial parameter is the sign of the north-south component ( B z ) of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). When the IMF is southward for any extended time (e.g., tens of minutes) the classic two-celled convection pattern is imposed on the iono- sphere. The magnetic field lines that thread the high-latitude ionosphere spread out enormously as they recede from the earth. This means that the pattern in the ionosphere represents a focused version of the electrodynamic processes that cre- ate the electric field pattern. Unfortunately, the topological mapping that occurs is quite complicated, since some field lines are open and some are closed. For steady B z south, the two-cell ionospheric flow pattern is more or less fixed with respect to the sun-earth line. The earth and its neutral atmosphere rotate under this plasma flow pattern once a day (ignoring tidal forcing and acceleration of the neutrals by the plasma). This creates a planetary scale, diurnally varying plasma flow field in the ionosphere. Now, even with B z held south, the classic symmetric two-celled flow shifts with respect to the sun-earth line as the other components of the IMF vary (particularly the component parallel to the earth’s orbit, B y ). This shifting of the flow field can occur within one or two Alfvén travel times from ionospheric altitudes to the generator. Likewise as B z and the velocity of the solar wind change, the rate of energy transfer to the magnetosphere varies from minute to minute and a flow field which is highly variable in space and time results. When B z changes sign, the major source of energy transfer ceases but other effects take over. A viscous interaction seems to create a small two-cell pattern and the connection of field lines to the IMF in regions of the magnetosphere far from the ecliptic plane also creates multiple cells with planetary scales (Burke et al., 1979). To gauge the effect of these complex flow fields on plasma content we first need to discuss the processes which create and destroy plasma on planetary scales. The most important source is photoionization by sunlight. In a nonrotating frame this region is bounded by the terminator, which moves across the polar region on a seasonal basis. On the dark side of this line, recombination rapidly destroys plasma below 200 km but only very slowly erodes the F-peak region. The time constant is roughly 1 hour at 300 km. Now when the planetary scale flow is imposed on this source and loss pattern, it is clear that solar plasma can be transported for vast distances into and clear through regions of total darkness before recombination can play much of a role."},{"pageNumber":479,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 471 In this way, planetary scale structuring of the plasma occurs which is much more complex and interesting than the simple terminator effect would be. A more subtle process can create planetary scale depletions of plasma as well. Since the dipole magnetic axis of the earth is offset by 11 ◦ from the rotation axis and the plasma flow is organized by the magnetic geometry, in the winter time some convection patterns have flux tubes that are never illuminated by sunlight. Then, very deep plasma depletions can occur due to recombination, yielding peak plasma densities as low as 10 3 cm − 3 with He + the dominant ion (see Fig. 9.1). The two-cell convection pattern is associated with another planetary scale plasma source: impact ionization by particle precipitation in the auroral oval. From a visual perspective, this band of light around the polar region expands and thickens with increasing B z southward and shrinks when B z is northward. Much of the plasma in this oval is created so low in the atmosphere ( ≤ 200 km) that it is short-lived. Nonetheless, the lowest energy precipitating particles produce plasma high enough in altitude to create an important F-layer plasma source, particularly in winter. 10.1.2 Some Effects of Plasma Transport and Loss on the Large-Scale Horizontal Structure of the Ionosphere One of the most fascinating aspects of the high-latitude ionosphere is its interac- tion with the various magnetospheric regions to which it is connected by mag- netic field lines. In portions of the ionosphere which are not sunlit, the influx of precipitating particles is one of the dominant sources of the ionospheric plasma; the other major source is transport from either a sunlit region or a region where particles are precipitating. One might at first suspect that solar-produced plasma would display very little structure in the F region, since the ionization is long lived and the source is smoothly varying. However, since the flow field varies drastically in time and space, even solar-produced plasma may become horizon- tally structured. It is, in fact, difficult to separate particle precipitation zones from electric field patterns, since they are intimately related. We concentrate on the latter in this section and then follow with some comment on precipitation in the next section. As discussed in Chapters 8 and 9, perpendicular electric fields occur throughout the auroral zone and polar cap. Their existence results in transport of F region plasma from production zones to areas where one might not expect to find much plasma at all. A good example is found in the winter polar cap. F region plasma is not produced by sunlight at all in this region and there is only a very weak particle input, called “polar rain,” when B z is northward. However, observations show considerable structured plasma in the polar cap. The red light emission of atomic oxygen at 630 nm due to recombination is sufficiently large to make this plasma visible to image-intensified camera systems. In Chapter 4 we showed that localized low-density regions could be observed as an absence of these emissions and pointed out that these airglow depletions were due to equatorial spread F wedges or bubbles. At high latitudes it is the enhancements"},{"pageNumber":480,"pageContent":"472 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics of plasma that are detected and which can be tracked by optical techniques. The all-sky camera photographs in Fig. 10.1 show just such a plasma patch marching across the field of view over Thule, Greenland. These structures are of the order of 1000 km across. In Section 10.2 we study the plasma instabilities that may develop on the edges of these regions of enhanced plasma density, but here we are interested in their origin and lifetime. This is determined by both recombination and diffusion. As noted by Rishbeth and Garriott (1969) and discussed in Chapter 5, a Chapman- like F layer subject to diffusion, gravity, and loss will preserve its shape and decay at a rate given by e − β( z 0 ) t , where β( z 0 ) is the recombination rate at the altitude z 0 of the peak in the plasma density. The decay time constant is about 1 hour. Numerical calculations verify this behavior (Schunk et al., 1976; Schunk and Sojka, 1987). The typical dawn-dusk electric field across the polar cap with B z south is 25 mV/m, which corresponds to 500 m/s velocity. In 1 h then a convecting patch can move 1800 km, just over 16 ◦ of latitude. Clearly, in such a rapid flow pattern both the dayside auroral oval and the sunlit dayside of the high-latitude zone can supply plasma to the dark polar cap regions with only modest loss due to recombination, gravity, and parallel diffusion. Diffusion of plasma perpendicular to B is much more complex and interesting than parallel diffusion, and we discuss this in Section 10.3.2. A quick estimate, however, shows that large structures will easily survive transport over long dis- tances without perpendicular diffusive loss. The time scale for perpendicular diffusion, τ D , is given by τ D = ( k 2 D ⊥ ) − 1 For the F region the classical diffusion coefficient has an upper limit given by the ion diffusion coefficient D i ⊥ , which has typical values in the range 10–50 m 2 /s. Even for D i ⊥ = 50 m 2 /s, a 10 km wavelength structure has a time constant of 14 h.

We still need to discuss how the patches shown in Fig. 10.1 are formed. We postpone for the moment structured sources of ionization to consider only elec- tric field effects. For example, large-scale ( k ∼ 1000 km) organization of the F- region plasma can occur when the flow field has spatial variations in that same scale. Such plasma structure can even evolve out of a uniform sunlit region if different portions of the plasma move into dark areas at different speeds. As shown in Fig. 2.2, this advection effect can cause the local plasma density to vary if ∂ n /∂ t =− ( V · ∇ ⊥ n ) \u0006= 0 (10.1) even when the production and loss terms vanish. Equation (10.1) holds for an incompressible fluid, a valid approximation for the F region. For sunlit conditions ∇ ⊥ n is determined by the solar depression angle, and the typical perpendicular gradient scale length L ⊥ =[ ( 1 / n )( dn / dx ) ] − 1 is several hundred kilometers. In (10.1) V = E × B / B 2 where E is the applied electric field. A graphic illustration of plasma structuring by a flow field is shown in Fig. 10.2. Here an initially cylindrical plasma blob is placed in a spatially varying flow characteristic of the duskside auroral oval. With time, the structure becomes very elongated in the magnetic east-west direction. Since the flow is incompressible, the elongation results in a very short scale size in the meridional direction. If the flow field is turbulent, as it usually is, patches may be formed from eddies in the flow and be carried off by the mean flow into the polar cap. Plasma loss through recombination can also create structure when coupled to a spatially varying flow field. This process was discussed in detail in Chapter 9, where the midlatitude plasma trough and the polar hole phenomena were shown to occur when the plasma remains for a long time on flux tubes with no sunlight and no particle precipitation. This can occur on flux tubes that flow west at the same speed as the earth rotates (the trough) or that circulate around a vortex that is entirely in darkness (the polar hole). Then even a slow decay rate is sufficient to deplete the plasma density. The midlatitude nightside trough can become particularly deep during mag- netic storms, when very large electric fields have been observed to build up at the equatorward edge of the plasma sheet-ring current system in the magnetosphere (Smiddy et al., 1977). This electric field points radially outward from the earth in the equatorial plane. Mapped to the ionosphere, this localized electric field is poleward and causes intense ionospheric flow toward the dusk terminator. In fact, the largest ionospheric electric field ever reported—350 mV/m—occurred in just such an event (Rich et al., 1980). Satellite data taken during such an event are reproduced in Fig. 10.3a. The top panels show the intense localized electric field (250 mV/m) near L = 4 (60 ◦ invariant latitude) with magnetic field, density, and energetic particle influx data plotted following.

At ionospheric altitudes the width of this high-flow region is between 150 and 200 km. These meridional scales are in the intermediate range but, through shear instabilities, can create larger scale longitudinal structures, as discussed in the next section. Modest small field-aligned currents were detected during this pass (Providakes et al., 1989). These large poleward electric field events have come to be called subauroral ion drifts (SAID) due to their signature in drift meter instruments (Spiro et al., 1979). There are two ways to think about their origin. The combination of E × B , gradient, and curvature drifts yield eastward zonal pressure gradients deep in the magnetosphere and thus radially inward currents. These currents close through poleward electric fields in the low conductivity nighttime subau- roral ionosphere, creating large poleward electric fields. The second viewpoint is that these same factors cause ions to precipitate equatorward of electrons"},{"pageNumber":483,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 475 S3-2 REV. 2087 2 May 76 ( a ) 250 200 150 100 50 0 300 200 100 0 10 8 GMT MLT ILAT ALT LAT 03:08:40 2045 58.6 1465 43.5 03:10:20 2034 62.6 1460 48.4 00 2043 59.4 1465 44.5 20 2041 60.2 1464 45.5 40 2039 61.0 1463 46.4 00 2037 61.8 1462 47.4 Total flux (E . 100 eV) (cm 2 . sec.ster) 2 1 D B 3 S (Gamma) 1 4 1 2 2 2 2 4 J IN \u0002 amp/m 2 2 6 1.51 0.64 0.83 0.88 0.35 T 5 2901°K T 5 1409°K H 1 O 1 10 3 Thermal electron density (cm) 2 3 Potential across boom 2 V 3 B (volts) 0 Electric field poleward (mV/m) 2 0.8 2 0.4 0 0.4 0.8 2 5.3 2 2.3 0 2.0 3.6 2500 2000 1500 1000 500 D L – Shell coordinate ( b ) Trough region Electron temp.

An example of such an event is shown in the upper panel of Fig. 10.3b, where the plasma density and the meridional electric field are plotted from data taken during an azimuth scan of the Millstone Hill radar (Providakes et al., 1989). This event occurred during a large solar minimum magnetic storm in which auroras were seen in the Washington, D.C. area of the United States. There is a clear anticorrelation between the observed plasma density and the flow velocity that is at least in part due to the velocity-dependent recombination rate. The ion and electron temperatures plotted in the lower panel are also elevated in the trough region. This deep trough is in some sense the ionospheric image of the interface region that bounds two quite different plasma populations in the magnetosphere: the cool, dense, corotating plasmasphere and the hot, tenuous, rapidly moving plasma sheet. It is not surprising, then, that a number of inter- esting phenomena occur at this location. The extremely large localized electric fields mentioned previously are one such phenomenon, and it is interesting to note that the potential difference across the region is the order of the temperature difference between the plasmasphere and the plasma sheet. A complete discus- sion of this interesting region is beyond the scope of this text, but we can touch on a few topics of particular interest. 10.1.3 Longitudinal Structures Due to Localized Sub-Auroral Electric Fields The ionospheric region just poleward of the trough is in contact with the plasma sheet and is rendered visible by the widespread particle precipitation that causes the atmospheric emissions referred to as the diffuse aurora. At times the equa- torward edge of the diffuse aurora is structured in very interesting patterns (Lui et al., 1982; Kelley, 1986). Two photographs taken in visible light from the DMSP satellite (800 km altitude) that illustrate this effect are shown in Fig. 10.4a. Note that the equatorial edge of the diffuse aurora is scalloped in a highly nonlinear fashion. Typical observed wavelengths of this feature range from 200 to 800 km. This seems to be a clear example of ionospheric F-region structuring due to a magnetospheric process. The argument is as fol- lows. Since the plasma sheet is the source of diffuse auroral precipitation, if the inner edge of the plasma sheet is distorted the light emissions and the produc- tion of plasma (see Section 10.1.3) in the ionosphere will mirror that distortion. Consequently, the F-region plasma will take on a horizontal structure with the same scale size. These relationships have been verified by simultaneous observa- tions of the undulations by radar and optical means (Providakes et al., 1989). This longitudinal structure will be superimposed on the latitudinal structure of the trough itself. There is evidence that the undulations on the equatorward edge of the auroral oval seen in high-altitude photographs (e.g., Fig. 10.4) occur at the time when the large localized electric fields exist and that the latter drive"},{"pageNumber":485,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 477 DMSP F6 December 13, 1985 1158 – 1204 UT GLAT 21 MLT 20 19 80 75 70 DMSP F6 December 13, 1985 1340 – 1346 UT GLAT 21 MLT 20 19 75 70 60 (a) (b) Figure 10.4a Outlines of auroral images photographed from the DMSP F6 satellite in the Northern Hemisphere at around (a) 1202 UT and (b) 1345 UT on December 13, 1985.

Yamamoto et al. (1994) have simulated this process with the results shown in Fig. 10.4b. The similarity with the data is striking. Another suggestion is that kinetic drift waves driven by the ion temperature gradient in the magnetosphere are the source of these features (Lewis et al., 2005). The lat- itudinally elongated smaller-scale structures of sub-arcs in the bottom panel of Fig. 10.4a suggest a set of thin field-aligned current sheets coming in and going out of the ionosphere. Radar observations of plasma at the poleward edge of the ionospheric trough also show that it is often structured. One example of the latitudinal structure of this region is given in Fig. 10.5, which shows the development and meridional motion of enhancements in the F-region plasma density. Initially there is a dense E-region layer beneath the F-region structure, indicating that it is collocated with precipitating electrons. As the plasma blob drifted equatorward, the plasma density became quite low in the E region below it.

Cole (1965) proposed that the ionospheric electrons are in good thermal contact with the hot magnetosphere along the magnetic field lines. In the trough, where the electron density is low, this input of heat raises the electron temperature more than, say, in the region poleward of the trough, where the heat input is also large but the electron density is high. The enhanced ion temperatures may be explained by a combination of thermal exchange with electrons and Joule heating due to the large electric field in the region of interest. Care must be exercised in interpreting ion temperatures from radar data, since the ion composition changes, shear flow on the sampled volume, and anisotropic ion distribution functions can all lead to incorrect interpretation of the width of the incoherent scatter spectrum and the T i estimate that results (Providakes et al., 1989). The high electron temperature in the trough leads to the phenomenon of stable auroral red (SAR) arcs. The emission is O( 1 D), the same as that which occurs in recombination as illustrated in Fig. 10.1, and is due to the impact of elec- trons from the tail of this distribution function on oxygen atoms. Very intense events can be visible to the naked eye (M. Mendillo, personal communication, 2005). These emissions usually reach from horizon to horizon. An example is presented in Fig. 10.6a, using a camera located in western New York State at approximately L = 3 . 5 (Nicolls et al., 2005). The red arc stretches from horizon to horizon but is not as unstructured as previous publications seem to imply. Pos- sible explanations for the undulations on the poleward edge include the ∇ n ×∇ T instability (Hudson and Kelly, 1978), the current convective instability (Ossakow and Chaturvedi, 1979), and possibly the thermomagnetic instability (Erukhimov and Kagan, 1994). DMSP data in Fig. 10.6b show that high electron temper- ature (over 6000 K), low electron density, and high velocity characterize the red arc. 10.1.5 Horizontal Plasma Variations Due to Localized Plasma Production and Heating When energetic particles precipitate into the atmosphere, energy loss occurs pri- marily via ionizing collisions. To a crude first approximation, for every 35 eV lost, one ion-electron pair is produced. A single kilo-electron-volt electron would thus yield about 30 pairs. The type of ion produced depends on the altitude where the collision occurs, since the atmospheric constituents vary with height. The ini- tial particle energy determines how deeply it can penetrate into the atmosphere."},{"pageNumber":489,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 481 2:58 LT 2:34 LT 2:10 LT 3:06 LT 2:42 LT 2:18 LT 3:13 LT 2:50 LT 2:26 LT Latitude ( 8 N) Latitude ( 8 N) Latitude ( 8 N) 278 280 282 284 286 288 278 280 282 284 286 288 278 280 282 284 286 288 Longitude ( 8 E) Longitude ( 8 E) Longitude ( 8 E) 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 46 45 44 43 42 41 40 39 Figure 10.6a Series of SAR arc images observed from Ithaca, NY, on October 28–29, 2000.

For F-region physics we are most concerned with “soft” particles—that is, elec- trons with energy less than about 500 eV—since they deposit their energy at the highest altitudes. Vertical transport by diffusion is crucial, however, since even soft electrons produce plasma at relatively low altitudes. Electron heat conduc- tion is also very important because secondary electrons are much more energetic than the ionospheric electrons and may heat the latter quickly, depending on the ratio of two electron populations. This can create a redistribution of plasma at high altitudes which mirrors the horizontal precipitation pattern. As discussed briefly in Chapter 1, soft electrons most copiously precipitate in the dayside cusp region, where magnetosheath plasma is in direct contact with the ionosphere. This occurs in the dayside auroral oval at invariant latitudes in the range 70–74 ◦ . Our interest here is not so much in the ionization process, which is more the topic of classical aeronomy (see, for example, Banks and Kockarts, 1973), as in the resulting horizontal variation in plasma content and structure.

Rocket data from the cusp region are even more striking. In Fig. 10.7 the plasma density and the total electron energy flux below 1 keV are plotted along a rocket trajectory (Kelley et al., 1982b). The two waveforms are clearly related and display an outer scale in the range λ ⊥ = 75–100 km. The plasma spectrum of the rocket data in Fig. 10.8 exhibits an outer scale of 75 km and a power law for smaller scales. For k 0 ≤ ( 2 π/ 30 ) rad/km, the power spectrum displays a power law dependence of the form, k − 1 . 9 . This good correlation between plasma density and electron flux is at first glance somewhat surprising, since the altitude of the observation is about a hundred kilometers higher than the altitude where most of the ionization occurs. This correlation, however, has been confirmed in another dayside auroral oval rocket experiment using the results of several independent plasma density instruments, so there is no question of contamination in the probe response. The particle flux and plasma density data from this latter flight are shown in Fig. 10.9 and clearly show a collocation of structured F-region plasma and particle precipita- tion zones. Roble and Rees (1977) have made a time-dependent model for the soft electron flux case in which the typical energy is the order of 100 eV. We may use this calculation to investigate the time scale required to build up a density increase of 1 . 5 × 10 5 cm − 3 at about 375 km as required by the data in Fig. 10.7. Roble and Rees found a local production rate of 300 cm − 3 s − 1 for a total energy input of 1 erg/cm 2 · s. For 5 ergs, then, as indicated by the particle detector data, the rate will be about 1 . 5 × 10 3 cm − 3 s − 1 . Roughly 100 s is therefore required.

Auroral arcs are very dynamic but this time scale is not at all unreasonable in the cusp, and we conclude that structured soft electron input can create a very irreg- ular F-layer plasma in the dayside auroral oval. Conversely, the hard spectrum studied by Roble and Rees (1977), which is typical in the heart of the nighttime auroral oval, had a production rate of only 100 cm − 3 s − 1 at 400 km even for a total energy input of 8 ergs/cm 2 · s. The poleward edge of the nighttime auroral oval, on the other hand, is also characterized by intense soft electron fluxes (Tanskanen et al., 1981) that are capable of producing F-region plasma enhancements. This source may be related to the numerous examples of plasma blobs in the nighttime oval detected by the Chatanika radar which are similar to the one shown in Fig. 10.10a. A spectral analysis of this particular radar map was performed by sampling the data with a horizontal cut through the data set at 350 km altitude. The power spectrum is given in Fig. 10.10b and is nearly identical to the rocket power spectrum shown in Fig. 10.8, which was obtained in the cusp region. These plasma blobs convect into and through the radar beam over a wide range of local times. Such enhancements could have been created at the poleward edge of the auroral oval and then convected into the field of view. They are much more common in the Alaskan sector at solar maximum, which may be due to the larger scale height of the neutral atmosphere and the corresponding increase in F-region plasma production when soft particles precipitate (J. Vickrey, personal communication, 1982)."},{"pageNumber":493,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 485 (b) 60 50 40 30 20 10 Power spectral density — dB (arbitrary scale) 0 0.01 Spatial frequency — km 2 1 0.1 (a) 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 61 62 27 February 1980 09:32 to 09:45 UT 63 64 65 66 Invariant latitude — degrees Altitude — km 67 68 69 70 71 Figure 10.10 (a) Altitude/latitude variation of electron density in the midnight sector auroral zone measured by the Chatanika radar.

When B z is northward, the auroral oval contracts and particle precipitation are much reduced in the auroral zone.

There seem to be two basic states of the polar cap when B z is north, an ordered multicell flow pattern and a chaotic flow (see Chapter 8 for details). In the ordered case, a very long sun-aligned auroral arc can form in the polar cap.

Then, because V = E × B / B 2 , we have J z = \b P (∂ E y /∂ y ) = \b P B (∂ V x /∂ y ) and thus J z =− \b P BW z (10.3b) This equation shows that J z is out of the northern hemisphere ionosphere when W z is positive and into the ionosphere when W z is negative. Since precipitating"},{"pageNumber":496,"pageContent":"488 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics electrons carry current away from the ionosphere, this relationship suggests that an arc should occur when the vorticity is positive. This dependence has indeed been reported for polar cap arcs by Burke et al. (1982). It is of interest also to note that, from Poisson’s equation, this result is equivalent to the statement that electron precipitation occurs into regions of net negative charge density (see Section 2.4), which seems counterintuitive but is correct for the usual case that the ionosphere acts as an electrical load. The multitude of polar arcs shown in Fig. 10.11a suggests a turbulent flow with many sign changes of the vorticity. This vorticity in the magnetospheric flow or solar wind creates charge separation in a low impedance source, which leads to field-aligned currents. These currents then become unstable at some altitude, which results in particle acceleration via parallel electric fields. The experimental situation is complicated by the conduc- tivity gradients which are created by the particle precipitation. In fact, detailed observations near a winter polar cap arc show that both conductivity gradients and structured electric fields are important in the horizontal current divergence (Weber et al., 1989). So far we have discussed the production of F-region plasma in the cusp (dayside oval), in the polar cap, and at the edge of the nightside auroral oval. In the heart of the nightside oval the situation is very chaotic, due in part to the role of substorm activity in the midnight sector. The series of Dynamics Explorer 1 images of the auroral oval in Fig. 10.12 shows some of the dynamical features in a typical substorm. As a crude first approximation there are three classes of oval precipitation, which may be described by their optical and plasma signatures. The diffuse aurora is characterized by a widespread, nearly uniform particle influx from the plasma sheet. Since the diffuse aurora mirrors the hot plasma sheet, it is also characterized by the same flow pattern, which is roughly zonally westward before midnight and zonally eastward after midnight. Imbedded in this plasma are regions of discrete auroral arcs that are usually aligned east-west and are often associated with potential drops along the magnetic field which accelerate electrons into the atmosphere. This acceleration zone has been located by satellite and rocket techniques at altitudes ranging from 2000 to 8000 km. This process occurs throughout the auroral oval. The auroral arcs in the dayside oval are associated with acceleration zones having several hundred to a thousand volts of potential drop. In the midnight sector the potential is higher and most of the plasma in this nighttime sector is produced by accelerated electrons striking neutrals in the E region. The intense E-region plasma density increase shown in Fig. 1.5 is of this type. Quiet auroral arcs are usually east-west aligned, that is, much smaller in latitudinal extent than in longitude. The active auroral forms associated with substorms comprise a third rough class of auroras. Other than the obvious comment that more plasma is produced in a bright aurora, active auroral forms are often extremely contorted. The examples in Fig. 1.4 and Fig. 10.12 show this very clearly. The plasma density produced by particle precipitation in the E and F regions will then also be quite structured. So many factors contribute to the horizontal structuring in the nightside oval"},{"pageNumber":497,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 489 Figure 10.12 Twelve consecutive images at ultraviolet wavelengths 123–160 nm record the development of an auroral substorm.

In some cases the character of the density profile itself gives a clue to the origin or at least the time history of the plasma. For example, if the E-region density is high, production must be occurring simultaneously, since recombination is very fast at low altitudes. Likewise, if electron temperature data are available (for example, from an incoherent scatter radar), they may be used to determine the history of F-region plasma. If precipitation is occurring, T e will be well elevated over the ion and neutral temperatures. If the long-lived F-region plasma has been produced elsewhere and has been advected into the field of view, however, the electron temperature will have had time to equilibrate with the other gases and a low T e is expected."},{"pageNumber":498,"pageContent":"490 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics We conclude that production and heating of plasma by long-lived soft particle precipitation creates much of the F-region horizontal structure in the auroral oval at scales from 30 to 100 km. Larger-scale features are more likely due to a combination of solar production, chemical losses, and transport by large-scale electric field patterns. These concepts have been verified in a series of computer model calculations by Schunk and Sojka (1987). 10.1.6 Summary We agree with Tsunoda (1988) that ionospheric plasma instabilities per se have very little to do with ionospheric structure at large to planetary scales. Con- vection, production, and loss are sufficient to create a marvelously complex ionosphere. 10.2 Intermediate-Scale Structure in the High-Latitude F Region The ordering of high-latitude plasma at scales above 30 km has been described in detail in the previous part of this chapter. Here we look into the processes which create structure in the range 0.1–30 km. There is a close analogy here to equatorial spread F phenomena in the following sense. At the largest scales in the equatorial case aeronomical processes such as production, recombination, and electrodynamic transport act in concert with neutral wind phenomena such as gravity waves to create the large-scale patterns. The intermediate-scale structur- ing then proceeds primarily via the generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability. At high latitudes, we have seen that aeronomical processes are further supplemented by structured particle precipitation and structured large-scale flow patterns. It should not be surprising then that intermediate-scale structuring in the auroral zone and polar cap is also more complicated than at the magnetic equator. In a turbulent neutral fluid, viscosity eventually limits the scale sizes where struc- ture occurs to values larger than some wavelength corresponding to the so-called viscous cutoff. In a plasma there are many more degrees of freedom in the sys- tem and new sources of structure may arise at various wavelength scales in the medium. In Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2 we concentrate on mechanisms that gen- erate structure at intermediate scales, scales that lie between the size of the auroral oval and the size of auroral arcs. Since the linear theory for plasma instabilities in this range appeals to diffusive damping as a limiting mechanism, we spend some time discussing cross-field plasma diffusion and images in Section 10.2.3. 10.2.1 The Generalized E × B Instability at High Latitudes Before delving into the differences, some similarities to equatorial spread F are to be noted.

The similarity is striking in that both profiles show a strong tendency for irregularity development on a preferred direction of the density gradient. The equatorial case is more violent with many irregularities pushing through to the stable side of the gradient. Gravity plays very little role in high-latitude phenomena, since g is essentially parallel to B .

As noted earlier, when ( E \b × B ) has a component parallel to ∇ n —that is, when ( E \b × B ) ·∇ n > 0 (10.4) the system is unstable. Referring back to Fig. 4.9a, we see that in this case per- turbation electric fields develop when a Pedersen current flows perpendicular to the zero-order density gradient in the presence of a small disturbance. In effect, a high-density region polarizes in such a way that it has a slower drift velocity than the background plasma. A high-density region therefore lags behind and seems to grow with respect to the background density as it drifts “down” the gradient. Low-density regions move in the opposite direction and seem to grow with respect to the background. Indeed, based on the AUREOL-3 satellite mea- surements of the electric field, the event in the upper panel of Fig. 10.13 was such that the instability condition in (10.4) was satisfied, since a 12 mV/m eastward zonal electric field component was measured and the density gradient was almost certainly poleward. We say “almost certainly” because only one component of ∇ n is measurable from a polar-orbiting satellite. Cerisier et al. (1985) have stud- ied six events of this type and found four of them to have (10.4), to the satisfied, to the best of their knowledge, given the ambiguity in ∇ n . It seems clear that the E × B process can and does occur in the high-latitude sector, and most of the discussion of the generalized Rayleigh-Taylor instability in Chapter 4 is directly applicable at high latitudes. However, there is one important caveat to raise. The satellite measures only E , not E \b = E + U × B , and the role of the neutral wind is just not known in most experiments. Usually one argues that because | E × B / B 2 | > | U | at high latitudes, the neu- tral wind plays only a minor role. However, at the boundaries of the auroral oval, where the plasma flow changes direction, electrodynamically driven neu- tral winds will not change direction as quickly as the plasma flow and could act as a source for instability. In the midnight sector, for example, we expect a"},{"pageNumber":501,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 493 southward neutral wind driven by ion drag in the polar cap. At the convection boundary E is in the meridian plane and thus plays no role in the stability of the poleward plasma density gradient which often exists at that boundary. However, if, as argued previously, U is in the southward direction, E \b × B is poleward, and thus the poleward wall of the trough could be unstable to the generalized E × B process. Concerning details of the E × B instability, there are some aspects of this process that differ from its development at equatorial and middle latitudes. Tsunoda (1988) has written an excellent review of these phenomena and we only hit the high points here. One feature involves the relatively high E-region Pedersen conductivity that exists at high latitudes. This affects both the growth rate and the loss rate of plasma structure. For example, a simple expression (Vickrey and Kelley, 1982) for the linear growth rate of the one-dimensional E × B instability for waves perpendicular to the gradient is of the form γ = E \b 0 BL ( M − 1 M ) − k 2 D ⊥ (10.5) where E \b 0 / B is the component of E \b × B / B 2 parallel to ∇ n , L the inverse gra- dient scale length, D ⊥ the height-averaged perpendicular diffusion coefficient, and M = ( \b E P + \b F P ) /\b E P . In the definition of M , \b F P is the field-line-integrated Pedersen conductivity in the F region and \b E P is the field-line-integrated Pedersen conductivity in the E region. If \b E P >\b F P , which is almost always the case in the auroral oval due to particle precipitation, the E region tends to short out the perturbation electric field, δ E , produced in an E × B instability and the growth rate becomes small. This is easy to understand because “growth” in the case of the E × B instability is just due to advection of high-density plasma down a gradient and low-density plasma up a gradient. The rate of change of the density is given by ∂ n /∂ t =− δ V ·∇ n ∼ = γδ n (10.6) where δ V = δ E × B / B 2 . If the perturbation charges that set up δ E are shorted out by current flow to the E region, the growth rate becomes small. The diffusive damping term also depends on the E region but in a subtle fashion that we postpone until Section 10.2.3. Tsunoda (1988) has compared M values for the auroral case with those for equatorial spread F and for large midlatitude barium releases. For equatorial spread F, he quotes values in the range 10 to 10 4 , while for low-altitude barium releases M ranges from 60 for a 1 kg release to 470 for a 48 kg release. Auroral F-region plasma enhancements, on the other hand, have M values less than 1.2 for reasonable E-region densities ( \b E P = 5 mho ) . Even for nighttime conditions with no E layer M ≤ 10 for F-region densities as high as 10 6 cm − 3 . On this basis alone it is clear that local plasma instabilities may be less dominant in the auroral zone than at other latitudes."},{"pageNumber":502,"pageContent":"494 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics The shorting process discussed previously is accomplished by field-aligned currents due to the E region, which shorts out both the driving fields, δ E , and the ambipolar electric fields (see Section 10.2.3) that limit diffusion across B . In addition to these structure-related currents, there are also large-scale field- aligned currents that link the magnetospheric and solar wind generators to the ionospheric load and that were discussed in some detail in Chapter 8. Here we investigate the role that such applied currents play with regard to the E × B instability. When field-aligned currents are included, the process is referred to in the literature as the current convective instability (Ossakow and Chaturvedi, 1979). In brief, when the ion and electron species have different drift velocities along the magnetic field line (and thus a net parallel current is carried by the ther- mal plasma), the E × B instability is modified in such a way that even plasma gradients stable to the E × B instability may in principle be unstable to the cur- rent convective process. In the case of the pure E × B process the most unstable wave has k || = 0. For the current convective instability to operate, a finite k || is required. To understand why this instability occurs we isolate the effect of an upward (northern hemisphere) field-aligned current acting alone as shown in Fig. 10.15. The finite k || is exaggerated to make the effect easier to illustrate.

The perturbation E × B drift in this phase of the wave is thus equal to + (δ E k / B ) ˆ a y , which means that a high-density region moves down the gradient to lower-density regions and therefore grows in relative amplitude. Therefore, the plasma is unstable. In this same configuration, suppose a background perpendicular zero-order electric field E 0 ⊥ = E 0 ⊥ ˆ a x existed in addition to the zero-order parallel electric field E 0 || .

First, we note that if both processes are unstable, (10.9) will show which one is more important. Second, if E 0 ⊥ is in the stable configuration while J || is destabilizing, instability is still pre- dicted if (10.9) is less than one. To estimate the magnitude of J || required to over- come, say, a stabilizing 10 mV/m perpendicular electric field ( V 0 ⊥ = 400 m/s), we use V || = j || / ne and set n = 5 × 10 4 cm − 3 to find J || ≥ 7 μ A/m 2 . This is a sizable current but is not out of the question for the auroral zone.

This result yields the flute mode ( k || = 0) E × B instability. Indeed, if we set θ max = 0 in (10.10), it reduces to the growth rate of the gradient drift instability. Thus, as already noted, a field-aligned current can serve to destabilize a plasma configuration that is otherwise stable to the E × B instability, or to enhance the growth rate of an already unstable situation. Choice of the negative sign in (10.11) corresponds to a damped acoustic mode. The linear local theory described here has a preferential tendency to create unstable conditions at low plasma densities, since for a fixed J || , V || is inversely proportional to n . The region above the F peak is therefore a region of high growth rate. However, the generalized process could very easily be stable on the same magnetic field line at or below the F peak. It is very clear then that a local theory is not very suitable. Such nonlocal effects in general reduce the growth rate. Note also that E-region shorting is every bit as important to the current convective instability as it is to the E × B instability and is not included in (10.10). Also, the growth rate given in (10.10) uses a perpendicular diffusion coefficient corresponding to a nonconducting E region, which may also underestimate the damping. Taken together, these negative aspects have led to the conclusion that although it is an interesting physical process, the current convective instability can only rarely overcome the stabilizing effects of an unfavorable E × B geometry. Finally, it should be noted that the instability only occurs when the current is carried by thermal plasma and does not apply when energetic electrons carry the bulk of an upward current. Erukhimov and Kagan (1994) proposed a thermal instability mechanism (which they named thermomagnetic) in which a strong field-aligned electric field is set up by conversion of the field-perpendicular electric field by a geomagnetic field-perpendicular magnetic perturbation. The induced field-aligned electric field is prevented from shorting out by electron inertia and is sustained by the plasma drift. Such type of electric field conversion takes place in stationary Alfvén wave (Knudsen, 1996). The induced field-aligned electric field is much stronger than usual and leads to the thermal instability generation discussed in (Erukhimov et al., 1982). The E-region analogue of the latter, based on ion heating, is devel- oped by Kagan and Kelley (2000).

Analyses of coordinated scintillation observations using orbital satellite beacons and the EISCAT radar by Kagan et al. (1995) showed that the ther- momagnetic instability is the most probable candidate for F-region 1 km-scale irregularities inside the trough. It is interesting that the same type of field-aligned electric field associated with stationary Alfvén waves seems to be responsible for ion outflows from auroral ionosphere that are observed above stable auroral arcs and are accompanied by strong electron temperature enhancements (Kagan and St.-Maurice, 2005). 10.2.2 Turbulent Mixing as an Alternative to Plasma Instabilities It is well known that the magnetospheric flow pattern is seldom laminar but rather is usually somewhere between turbulent and extremely turbulent (Crow- ley and Hackert, 2001; Earle and Kelley, 1993). The effect of this turbulence is to mix any existing density gradient due to solar production or particle impact ion- ization regardless of the sign of the gradient. We can estimate the turbulence level necessary to accomplish a higher level of density structure than that provided by the E × B process as follows. We assume that the layer has the appropriate sign for instability, but, of course, this will happen only 50% of the time. The simple form of the linear growth rate for the E × B instability is γ EB , given previously. If that same gradient is structured by a spatial electric field pattern characterized by some wave number spectrum E ( k ) , then we may use the continuity equation ∂ n /∂ t =− V ·∇ n"},{"pageNumber":508,"pageContent":"500 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics to define a mixing growth rate γ m ( k ) , which is a function of k : γ m ( k ) = E ( k )/ BL To compare the mixing growth rate to the linear E × B growth rate, which is independent of k , we must integrate γ m ( k ) over some portion of the turbulent spectrum. Then \u000f m = [ ∫ \u0010 k E 2 ( k ) dk ] 1 / 2 / BL (10.12) is the appropriate growth rate provided \u0010 k is chosen properly. Since the impor- tant wavelength range is for k > k L = 2 π/ L , we integrate from k L to ∞ . The ratio of turbulent mixing to the plasma instability source is then R = \u000f m /γ EB = ( 1 / E 0 ⊥ ) ( ∫ ∞ k L E 2 ( k ) dk ) 1 / 2 = E rms E 0 ⊥ (10.13) The numerator is the rms electric field between k L and ∞ ( E rms ) . Turbulent mixing is important when R ≥ 1—that is, when the mixing growth rate is com- parable to the linear growth rate of the plasma instability. The mixing process will even dominate the physics on an unstable gradient if the rms electric field in the range \u0010 k exceeds E 0 ⊥ , the quasi-dc component perpendicular to ∇ n . For a stable gradient the mixing effect will, of course, be the dominant source and R need not be greater than 1. Furthermore, since turbulent fields are supplied by a low impedance magnetosphere generator, they will not be shorted out by the E region. Surprisingly, very few electric field spectra exist in the literature. One example from the dawn auroral oval is presented in Fig. 10.16. The upper plot comes from periods of the flight near aurorae arcs (note that the scale is broken). The spectra show evidence for two turbulent processes, one operating at long wavelengths yielding a k − 5 / 3 power law and one which injects turbulence in the ionosphere at the scale of individual auroral arcs. The latter process seems to result in a k − 3 power law form for large k > k b ≈ 20 km − 1 . These two power laws are in agreement with predictions of two-dimensional turbulence theory (Kintner and Seyler, 1985). The k -space integrals corresponding to these two regimes yield rms electric fields of 10 and 9 mV/m, respectively. Such values for E rms indicate a significant role for turbulent mixing, since E rms / E 0 ⊥ ≈ 0 . 5 for this event. The fact of the matter is that auroral arcs are inextricably intertwined with structured electric fields. At the altitude of the auroral acceleration zone ( ≈ 3000 − 5000 km), in fact, the electric field is turbulent in a much larger region than that of the electron beams themselves. The acceleration zone is imbedded in this turbulent plasma which partially extends to ionospheric heights.

The ionosphere is not passive in this context, however. Detailed study has shown that the magnetosphere behaves as a current generator at these scales (Vickrey et al., 1986). This in turn implies that the turbulent electric field and flow velocity are inversely proportional to the ionospheric conductivity. This is evident when one compares winter and summer hemispheres (e.g., see Fig. 8.8b). The winter ionosphere has a much more structured velocity field than does the summer ionosphere. One hypothesis is that the solar wind-driven flow in the magnetosphere has its own turbulent characteristics that are moderated by the gross E-region conductivity due to solar lighting conditions, diffuse auroral pre- cipitation, and polar rain. Superposed on this are localized regions of turbulence associated with auroral arcs that create plasma and strongly mix it at the same time. At this scale the E region itself becomes dominated by the precipitation and the conductivity, and the flow field and plasma content are intertwined in a fundamental way. A review (Kintner and Seyler, 1985) discussing the interre- lationship between plasma fluid turbulence and plasma density variations in the ionosphere has been published. Although no direct conclusions were reached, a framework was provided for this study and progress is still needed in this area."},{"pageNumber":510,"pageContent":"502 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics Further evidence for a turbulent mixing process at scales on the border between “large” and “intermediate” has been presented by Tsunoda et al. (1985). They studied a highly structured F region that was characterized by a stable E × B situation. They concluded that a driven mixing process was occurring but one that was not explained by the E × B instability. Similarly, referring to the data in Fig. 10.1, the high scintillation levels that were reported in association with plasma patches in the polar cap were found throughout the patches. That is, kilometer-scale irregularities were located on gradients with either sign, even though the mean patch convection is associated with a particular E × B flow direction. Scintillation studies have also shown that regions of plasma shear are very irregular (Basu et al., 1986). We therefore conclude that impressed turbulent electric fields of magnetospheric origin play an important role in creating iono- spheric structure at high latitudes. 10.2.3 Diffusion and Image Formation As noted previously, the lifetime of a horizontal structure in the high-latitude ionosphere depends on how quickly the plasma can diffuse across the magnetic field. Also, whether a particular plasma instability is stable or unstable at a given k value depends on whether some positive contribution to the growth rate exceeds diffusive damping due to terms of the form − k 2 D ⊥ . In Chapter 5 we pointed out that parallel diffusion which operates with a time scale ( k 2 D || ) − 1 is determined by the ion diffusion coefficient and that D || = 2 D i The factor of 2 comes from the fact that an ambipolar electric field builds up when electrons attempt to diffuse away quickly parallel to B due to their small mass. In effect, each electron has to drag a heavy ion with it along B , and the plasma diffusion coefficient is then determined by the ions. Perpendicular to B , an analogous process occurs.

Intuitively this makes sense, since a particle will randomly walk one gyroradius between each collision. Since r gj is much larger for ions than for electrons, the ions tend to diffuse more rapidly down a density gradient which exists perpendicular to the magnetic field than do the electrons. However, when this occurs an electric field builds up parallel to ∇ n , so the ion motion across the field lines is retarded and the electron motion is enhanced. The result (derived following) is that an isolated plasma structure diffuses across a magnetic field with a diffusion coefficient equal to the low electron diffusion coefficient. The preceding discussion assumes that the F-region plasma is the only plasma in the system. However, if an E region exists due to production of plasma by sunlight or production by auroral particle precipitation, the ambipolar electric field discussed previously will be shorted out and the ions may then diffuse rapidly across the magnetic field. The electrons still cannot move across B , but they can move along the magnetic field to complete the circuit through the E region and therefore neutralize the ambipolar electric field. The entire process is illustrated schematically in Fig. 10.17a. The converging arrows in the E region represent the ambipolar electric field, which maps down to the E region due to the high conductivity parallel to B . Those arrows also show the direction of the E region ion current that completes the circuit. The inner and outer sets of arrows show the electron flow direction. The line through the F-region structure represents the vertical magnetic field line. A quantitative description of this diffusion process must allow for altitude vari- ations in all the relevant quantities. Vickrey and Kelley (1982) have performed such calculations for a model ionosphere and computed the typical effective dif- fusion coefficient plotted in Fig. 10.17b as a function of the ratio of E region to F-region conductivities. The effective (field-line-integrated) diffusion coefficient increases from roughly 1 m 2 /s to more than 10 m 2 /s as the E-region conductivity increases. Also plotted is the e -folding time, τ ⊥ = ( k 2 ⊥ D ⊥ ) − 1 , for a horizontal structure with a characteristic perpendicular wavelength of 1 km. Even for high E-region conductivity the diffusion time scale is several hours for such a struc- ture, and it could survive considerable transport around the high-latitude zone. In this particular calculation, the F layer had a Chapman distribution characterized by the parameters listed in the plot. Kelley et al.

The resulting ampli- tude distribution depended on season and local time because of the peculiar trajectories of some flux tubes (see Chapter 8). Further advances in this area required a self-consistent calculation of the ambipolar electric field because, unlike the simplification used by Vickrey and Kelley (1982), which is valid only for large structures, the electric field mapping process is scale size dependent (see Chapter 2). In addition, the E region is not a passive medium but rather one in which structures can form that mirror the F region irregularities. These “images” were first pointed out in the context of barium cloud striation physics by Goldman et al. (1976). In the remainder of this section we follow a unified description of diffusion that includes F and E-region coupling (Heelis et al., 1985). First, it should be emphasized that the electrical conductivity along the magnetic field lines is not infinite but rather is a finite, usually large, quantity. The mapping characteristics of electric fields can easily be deduced by considering the current continuity equa- tion and employing analysis methods such as those discussed by Farley (1959) and presented in Chapter 2. Figure 10.18 shows some solutions for different scale size electric field structures applied at 500 km altitude. The ionospheric plasma concentration profile used in the calculation is shown in the right panel. As expected, we see that a 10 km structure maps almost unattenuated throughout the E and F regions. At scale sizes below 5 km, however, significant attenuation occurs and can render the electric field essentially zero below 200 km for fields with scale sizes of 1 km or less that are applied at high altitudes. 500 400 300 Altitude (km) 200 100 0.0 0.5 Normalized p otential Ion concentration ( cm 2 3 ) 1.0 10. 7. 4. 3. 2. 1. .5 .3 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 Figure 10.18 The variation in electrostatic potential from different scale size electric fields is shown in the left panel.

The presence of an electric field in a conducting region will drive a horizontal current that will tend to short the applied electric field. The electric field can then be maintained at the generator only if it can supply the current required in the conducting region. Let us consider the forces acting on a plasma concentration structure in an ionosphere with a vertical magnetic field. First, a pressure gradient force will exist on both the ions and the electron gases. But, as shown previously, owing to the different masses of these particles and their correspondingly different collision frequencies and gyrofrequencies, these two species will move at different rates. Any tendency for separation of the ions and electrons in this manner will produce an electric force. The horizontal motion of the electrons and ions subject to these forces can be determined by manipulation of the steady-state equations of motion for each species. Rather complex expressions result if all the terms in these equations are retained. This is the usual practice in computer models, but in order to illustrate the dominant physics we consider only the horizontal ion motion and assume that electron-ion collisions have a negligible effect. At high latitudes we may assume g × B = 0, in which case the horizontal motions are not affected by gravity. Then from (2.36b) V ix = ( σ Pi / en ) E − ( D i ⊥ / n ) ∇ x n (10.15) Here x again denotes the direction of the gradient, and we have set n i = n e = n due to the quasi-neutrality condition. The ion Pedersen conductivity, or σ Pi , and the ion perpendicular diffusion coefficient, D i ⊥ , are given in general form by σ Pi = ( e 2 n ν in )/ M i ( \u000e 2 i + ν 2 in ) D i ⊥ = ( k B T i ν in ) / M i ( \u000e 2 i + ν 2 in ) Similarly, the horizontal electron velocity can be expressed as V ex =− ( σ ei / en ) E − ( D e ⊥ / n ) ∇ x n + RV ix (10.16) where the factor R is given by R = \u000e 2 e ν ie /ν in + ν ei /ν e \u000e 2 e + ν 2 e and arises because ion-electron collisions are not always negligible for the elec- trons. Finally, Eqs. (10.15) and (10.16) can be combined to yield an expression for the local horizontal Pedersen current, J P =[ ( 1 − R )σ Pi + σ Pe ] E − e [ ( 1 − R ) D i ⊥ − D e ⊥ ]∇ x n (10.17)"},{"pageNumber":516,"pageContent":"508 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics The magnitude of ionospheric structure and its time evolution are related by the equations of continuity and momentum, both of which contain the plasma velocity. If we consider an ionospheric structure not subject to any production, then the continuity equation for the ions may be written as ∂ n /∂ t = ( − L ) −∇· ( nV i ⊥ ) −∇· ( nV i || ) Here the ion velocity has been expressed in terms of its components perpendic- ular ( ⊥ ) and parallel (||) to the magnetic field. If we further simplify the problem by considering electric fields produced by the structure itself and neglect any parallel ion motion produced by the structure, then the ion velocity is given by (8.15) and the continuity equation can be rewritten in the form ∂ n /∂ t =− L −∇· (σ Pi / e ) E +∇· ( D i ⊥ ∇ n ) At this point it is a common practice to “linearize” the equations by expressing each of the plasma properties as the sum of a background value and a small perturbation value due to the existence of the structure. Then all terms containing products of perturbation values are ignored, since they are much smaller than the other terms. If we denote all background values with the superscript “o,” assume a horizontally stratified background ionosphere and ignore losses, then the continuity equation may be written finally as ∂ n ∂ t =− ( σ o Pi / e ) ∇ x E + D o i ⊥ ∇ 2 x n (10.18) Now consider two extreme situations. First, suppose the local electric field associated with the plasma structure in the F region is completely shorted ( E = 0) by mapping to a highly conducting E region. Investigation of (10.18) shows that for E = 0 the classical diffusion equation results with D ⊥ = D i ⊥ , the ion diffusion coefficient. This is the maximum possible value of D ⊥ under the circumstances considered. In the other limit, suppose that the structure cannot drive a Pedersen current because it maps to an E region that is an insulator. Then we may solve for the electric field obtained by setting the current in (10.17) to zero and substitute the result in (10.18). In the F region, where R << 1, the electric field from (10.17) becomes E x = e ( D o i ⊥ − D o e ⊥ ) σ o iP + σ o eP ∇ x n Substituting this result into (10.18) yields ∂ n ∂ t = [ D o i ⊥ − σ o iP ( D o i ⊥ − D o e ⊥ σ o iP + σ o eP )] ∇ 2 x n"},{"pageNumber":517,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 509 Since in the F region σ o iP >> σ o eP , this reduces to ∂ n /∂ t = D e ⊥ ( ∇ 2 x n ) In this case therefore the velocity and associated decay rate of the structure will be the minimum possible under the circumstances considered and will be characterized by the electron diffusion coefficient D e ⊥ . From the previous discussion it should be clear that the decay rate of an F- region irregularity depends not only on its scale size and the local ionospheric conditions but also on the mapping properties of the electric field and on the conductivity of the regions throughout which the field maps. In our description we considered two extreme examples where the electric field was easily deter- mined. In practice, however, the electric field will be determined by applying the current continuity condition on an intermediate state. This yields slightly more complicated equations but with essentially the same characteristics. One further point to consider is the effect that the current produced by a structure in the F region might have in the E region. This can be an important consideration because the relatively high collision frequencies in the E region mean that the plasma is compressible. If this compressional force can overcome the horizontal diffusion forces that oppose it in the E region, then a structure can form there that mimics the one in the F region. In order to be significant, this structure formation process in the E region must also overcome the high rate of dissociative recombination that exists at such altitudes. We now investigate the conditions under which such an “image” structure can be formed. The image formation process can be understood from Fig. 10.17a for a pure decaying cylindrical irregularity in which the only electric field is due to the ambipolar effect. For a large enough structure, the E field maps as shown and E- region ions are gathered together in the center region because of their Pedersen drifts. The requirement of charge neutrality is met by electrons flowing down B to the E region. The net result is that the E-region plasma density (ions and electrons) increases at the center. That is, an image high-density region forms in the center and two low-density regions form outside. The image amplitude will eventually be limited by recombination in the E region, which is proportional to n 2 . Notice that the plasma-gathering process can be discussed in terms of compressibility of plasma in the E region in response to the applied electric field. The F region plasma, on the other hand, is virtually incompressible perpendicular to B . Although interesting in their own right, we have not explained the role images play in F-region diffusion. The E-region plasma density gradient due to an image drives an ion current opposite in direction to the mapped electric field. The net field-aligned current from the F region is therefore decreased, and the F-region diffusion coefficient is lowered, tending more toward the low value of D ⊥ which pertains for an insulating E region. Now, since the mapping process is itself scale size dependent, we conclude that the effective diffusion coefficient of high- latitude plasma irregularities may also be scale size dependent if the E-region"},{"pageNumber":518,"pageContent":"510 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics density is neither too high nor too low. Vickrey et al. (1984) provided evidence that images can be formed on off-equatorial field lines in contact with a structural F region during a convective ionospheric storm. 10.3 Small-Scale Waves in the High-Latitude F Region For this purpose we define small-scale wavelengths to be less than 100 m. Research in this area has not progressed as rapidly as it has in the equatorial zone. One reason is that the observational data base using radars is not very large. In the equatorial case the Jicamarca and Altair radars can easily scatter from irregularities with wave numbers perpendicular to B , since the geometry is favorable. Since these waves have much larger growth rates than waves with finite k || , they dominate the spectrum. At the high-latitude radar sites, it is geo- metrically impossible to obtain the appropriate backscatter angle in the F region using VHF and UHF systems. F-region radar observations are possible at HF frequencies, since ionospheric refraction can be used to bend the radar signals and attain a scattering geom- etry nearly perpendicular to B . Successful measurements of this type were first made systematically in Scandinavia (Villain et al., 1985) and from a transmitting station in Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada (Greenwald et al., 1983). The obser- vation volume for the latter site is located over the Sondre Stromfjord, Green- land, incoherent scatter radar station. The results show that echoes are indeed received in the tens of meters wavelength range but a detailed explanation does not yet exist for the scattering structures. The Super Darn HF radar system uses these structures and it is very surprising that we do not understand them better. Clues concerning the origin of these waves come from the Doppler shift of the returned HF signal. During one event simultaneous measurements were made with the incoherent scatter radar at Sondre Stromfjord. The latter can be used independently to determine the plasma drift velocity projected along the HF radar line of sight. The two data sets are superimposed in Fig. 10.19 and show quite good agreement. The implication is that the irregularities are frozen into the plasma flow—that is, that the phase velocity of the structures is small in the plasma reference frame. The long-wavelength instability processes discussed in Section 10.2 do have this low-phase velocity property. However, it is easy to show that at a wavelength of 10 m, the E × B instability is stable. For example, we may let E 0 ⊥ = 20 mV/m, L = 10 km, and D ⊥ = 1m 2 /s, which is on the small side, and solve the equation γ = mE 0 ⊥ / LB − k 2 m D ⊥ = 0 for the marginally stable wave number k m . This yields a wavelength λ m = 30 m. A larger diffusion coefficient will only make the value of λ m larger."},{"pageNumber":519,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 511 1200 1000 Doppler velocity (m/s) 800 600 400 200 0 \u0002 200 \u0002 400 \u0002 600 \u0002 800 \u0002 1000 \u0002 1200 20 h 50 m 21 h 0 m 21 h 10 m 21 h 20 m Time (UT) Figure 10.19 Comparison of time series data for HF (heavy crosses) and incoherent scatter (light crosses) velocity estimates calculated for the returns received from the nearby volumes.

Reproduced with permission of the American Geophysical Union.] Unless some additional instability arises at small scales, a possibility we address soon, the only way waves with λ ≤ 10 m can arise is through a cascade of structure from long to short λ . There is a curious difference between high- and low-latitude irregularities in this regard. As discussed in Chapter 4, convective ionospheric storms evolve in such a way that a very steep spectrum ( k − 5 ) evolves for δ n 2 ( k )/ n 2 when λ ≤ 100 m. This spectral range looks very much like a viscous subrange in neutral turbulence and has been termed the diffusive subrange. No analogy to the viscous or diffusive subrange has been reported at high latitudes. Measurements on satellites and rockets do show that the spectrum of plasma density fluctuations varies as k − n in the wavelength regime from tens of meters to tens of kilometers (Dyson et al., 1974; Sagalyn et al., 1974; Cerisier et al., 1985), where typically 1 . 5 ≤ n ≤ 2 . 5. As discussed in Chapter 4, this spec- tral form has also been reported for equatorial measurements and barium cloud striations. In both bottomside spread F and low-altitude barium striations such spectra were shown to be due to wave steepening and not to turbulence (Costa and Kelley, 1978; Kelley et al., 1979). There has been no evidence to date that steepening occurs at high latitudes; rather, turbulent processes appear to dominate. An example from a rocket flight is reproduced in Fig. 10.20.

The Fourier transform of these data is also shown and indicates a power spectral index n of about 1.6, which is con- sistent with a Kolmogorov ( n = 5 / 3) spectrum (the straight line has a 5/3 slope). These auroral rocket data were obtained within minutes of the poleward surge of a magnetospheric substorm. The signal level was above the noise for λ ≥ 60 m. This unexplained difference between the “q-machine” plasma at low latitudes and the violent high-latitude ionosphere is perplexing. Our instincts suggest that field-aligned currents matter at high latitudes and break the transition to damped diffusion waves. Perhaps the current convective instability dominates the cascade process. Bohm diffusion always seems to occur in the laboratory and perhaps this is the answer here as well. The latter is thought to be related to field-aligned currents and ion cyclotron waves. Some evidence for the latter exists in very high J || cases. Information on even shorter-wavelength waves ( ≤ 10 m) comes almost entirely from rocket measurements, due to the high data rates required. Three distinct types of irregularities were observed during a rocket flight into the recovery phase of a magnetospheric substorm on April 2, 1970 (Bering et al., 1975; Kelley et al., 1975; Kelley and Carlson, 1977). At the edge of an auroral arc, as detected by onboard particle detectors, intense (5 mV/m) oxygen electrostatic ion cyclotron waves were observed in data from the electric field wave receiver. A spectrum from the rocket results is presented in Fig. 10.21. Existence of such waves is consistent with auroral backscatter measurements of cyclotron waves in the ionosphere. Both data sets indicate that the waves occur in a very local- ized area.

Less intense irregularities in the same wavelength regime were observed equatorward of the arc but not above the arc itself or poleward of it. The dc electric field was such that the ionospheric plasma convection had an equatorward component in the whole region probed, which suggests that the structures may have been formed at the arc boundary and were transported equatorward. Similar spectra have been reported in the dayside auroral oval by Earle (1988) and Earle and Kelley (1993). The possible origins of ionospheric structure with scales in the range of a few meters ( ≈ r gi ) to a few tens of meters are quite numerous and no unifying mechanism is likely to explain all of the observations. It is very likely that some energy cascades into this wavelength range from larger scales in a manner similar to neutral turbulence. In a plasma the situation is made much more complicated by the possible generation of wave modes which compete with or modify the cascade concept. Of the several possible free energy sources available, most theoretical effort has gone into calculations of the generation of electrostatic ion cyclotron waves"},{"pageNumber":522,"pageContent":"514 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics by field-aligned currents and, as noted previously, evidence does exist for their generation. This wave mode arises when V th i ≤ J || / ne ≤ V th e which corresponds to parallel current due to a differential drift between ions and electrons which falls between the ion and electron thermal speeds. In the lower ionosphere collisions must be taken into account, while higher up collisionless theory is adequate. The threshold parallel current density for O + and NO + cyclotron waves is plotted in Fig. 10.22 for a reference ionospheric profile and for a wavelength corresponding to ( kr gi ) = √ 2. The calculation includes collisions. The required current densities are higher than the average observed field-aligned currents but not higher than some of the largest reported examples of J || (e.g., Burke et al., 1980). Thus, oxygen cyclotron waves should occur in the ionosphere but are rare and may be restricted to the edges of auroral arcs and/or regions of strong velocity turbulence.

(10.3)], it is not yet clear which free energy source is most important. Mix- ing and turbulent cascade will occur as well. Basu et al. (1986) have also shown a tendency for intense irregularities at large scales to arise in regions of veloc- ity shear. An ionospheric Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may occur due to these shears (Keskinen et al. , 1988). Finally, it seems very likely that turbulence in the auroral acceleration zone will propagate via an Alfvén wave mode to ionospheric altitudes and create considerable structure in the plasma flow velocity and the plasma density (Knudsen et al., 1992). 10.4 E-Region Layering at High Latitudes Plasma layers are also common at high latitudes and are reasonably common in the central polar cap.

The lower panel is the sodium atom density mea- sured using sodium lidar and is clearly related to the plasma layer. The most likely explanation for such effects is that ionized sodium recombines to yield the atom layer (Cox and Plane, 1998). There seems to be little evidence that auroral particles release sodium from a dust layer (Heinselman et al., 1998), as has been suggested (von Zahn et al., 1987). For example, no precipitation occurred but a strong Na layer developed. The magnetic field is almost vertical at high lati- tudes, so the midlatitude wind-shear mechanism is not very effective in gathering the plasma. The small off-vertical angle, however, is very important because of large-magnitude perpendicular electric fields. For example, a southward electric field will cause a small Pedersen drift downward, which is a strong function of altitude. As the particles drift down perpendicular to B , their velocity decreases due to the increasing collision frequency. As they slow down, a layer develops with time. The abrupt onset in Fig. 10.23 could be due to advection of the plasma cloud into the view of the radar. In the polar cap neither of the mechanisms involving horizontal electric fields and/or neutral winds will work because the vertical velocity is proportional to cosine of a dip angle, which becomes 0.034 for the dip of 88 ◦ compared to 0.17 for the dip angle of 80 ◦ . Based on observations made with the Canadian Advanced Digital Ionosonde (CADI) at three stations in the north polar cap (Alert, Eureka, and Resolute Bay), MacDougall et al. (2000a, b) distinguish two types of ionization layers: height-spread (maximum occurrence during 20:00 LT in winter) and thin (maximum occurrence near 12:00 LT in summer). They proposed that the height-spread Es is caused by transport of metallic ions from the dayside E region to the central polar cap lower F region. The metallic ions then sediment into an exponentially increasing atmosphere and form a layer. They may also be converged by gravity waves. The gravity wave signature is clearly seen for many high-latitude observations, including the one in Fig. 10.23 for Sondrestrom (dip is 80 ◦ ). MacDougall et al. (2000a, b) observed similar Es undulations at Eureka and Resolute Bay on January 1, 1995. Enhancements in E-region ionization were accompanied by plasma depletions in the F region (see their Fig. 1), again suggesting some sedimentation. The thin Es that is observed only in summer is produced by photoionization followed by charge exchange with neutral metallic atoms. MacDougall et al. (2000a, b) found that both winter and summer Es types were associated with positive IMF By. Why this is so is yet not clear. One explanation could be in the enhanced gravity wave activity during positive IMF By. 10.5 Plasma Waves and Irregularities in the High-Latitude E Region: Observations Due to the high neutral density at E-region heights, plasma production, dif- fusion, and recombination all proceed very rapidly.

In the vertical direction, the energy distributions of the photon or particle impact ionization sources are important. Since we are more interested in dynamical processes in this text, we do not treat production and loss processes in any detail. The reader is referred to texts by Rishbeth and Garriott (1969) and Banks and Kockarts (1973). Gravity waves are somewhat less important as a source of vertical structuring at high latitudes due to the large dip angle of the magnetic field. Just as is the case at the magnetic equator, the two primary plasma instabil- ities sources of structure in the auroral E region are the two-stream and gra- dient drift instabilities. The radar echoes are referred to as type 1 and type 2, based on the spectral width and mean Doppler shift. Although it is often thought that these two designation types correspond to each other, it seems this is not the case. These instabilities have been discussed in great detail in Chapter 4. There are some major differences in the character of the ionosphere at high latitudes, however, that affect the relative importance of these two pro- cesses. In addition, there is evidence for a third radar mode (type 3) and for a special type of type 1 associated with anomalous electron heating by the electrojet waves (type 4). The electric field in the polar cap and auroral zone is applied from “above” and is appreciably larger and more widespread than in the equatorial region. The average auroral electric field, for example, has a strong diurnal component with an amplitude of 30 mV/m and maxima near 0500 and 1800 LT (Mozer and Lucht, 1974). Fields as high as 50 mV/m are common in both the oval and polar cap, and numerous measurements exceed- ing 100 mV/m have been reported. The latter corresponds to a drift velocity of 2000 m/s, which is a value five times higher than the threshold of the two-stream instability. The plasma density structure is much more variable in the auroral zone than in the equatorial region. However, in the auroral region the magnetic field is inclined at about 10 ◦ to the vertical, and therefore a vertical electron density gradient has a density scale length perpendicular to the magnetic field that is appreciably larger than the same vertical gradient would have at the magnetic equator. This in turn means that the gradient drift instability tends to have a lower growth rate at high latitudes for the same size vertical gradients even though the plasma drifts are larger. In the auroral region there are also important horizontal density gradients due to spatial variations in the particle precipitation that must be considered but that are difficult to measure. The dynamic nature of both electric fields and density gradients makes analy- sis of auroral E-region instabilities even more challenging than their equatorial counterpart. On the other hand, a wealth of radar data does exist at E-region heights. These data have been supplemented by results from a number of rocket flights and a fairly complete experimental picture has emerged. In this chapter we concentrate on the plasma instabilities which operate in the auroral E region. In the next few sections some of the salient experimental data are presented. This"},{"pageNumber":526,"pageContent":"518 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics is followed by a theoretical discussion in which additional data are introduced where appropriate. Since auroral currents can be quite large, the term auroral electrojet is often used. The “jet” in this case refers to the relatively localized height range of the current rather than a narrow latitudinal range which characterizes the equatorial jet as well. 10.5.1 Radar Observations In the equatorial electrojet most radar observations resolve into two classes: type 1 irregularities, which display a narrow Doppler spike that is offset from zero by the acoustic frequency ω A = kC s ; and type 2 irregularities, which display a broad Doppler spread centered on the frequency corresponding to the line-of- sight electron drift velocity. Both of these echo types have their counterparts in the auroral case. However, as summarized in a review by Fejer and Kelley (1980), there are various Doppler signatures associated with the “radar aurora.” Since that review was written, considerable progress has been made in theoretical and experimental studies aimed at sorting out the origins of the various spectral signatures. The four Doppler spectral types are shown in Fig. 10.24. The spectrum in the upper panel is very much like a narrow type 1 echo at the magnetic equator that locks onto the acoustic frequency. The second spectrum is very broad with a Doppler shift of less than C s and is not unlike the equatorial type 2 case. In the third panel a very narrow spectrum is shown that has a Doppler velocity that is much less than the acoustic speed and which corresponds to a Doppler shift of about 70 Hz. The signals in this mode are very strong and thus when the spectra are normalized the narrow spike becomes a dominant feature. These waves were first reported by Fejer et al. (1984b) and have inspired considerable theoretical interest. The implication of the narrow spike is that a very coherent wave is present. The 70 Hz Doppler shift is about 40% above the gyrofrequency of O + , which has led to a number of studies dealing with the excitation of oxygen cyclotron waves in the upper E region or lower F region. We return to this topic in the discussion section following. We turn now to the fourth type of Doppler signature. High-latitude Doppler spectra often display such large “type 1” Doppler shifts that it was originally thought that in the high-latitude case, 3 m waves did not reach a limiting phase velocity at C s . The Doppler drift was therefore assumed to be equal to the line-of-sight electron drift speed, a result in agreement with the linear theory of two-stream irregularities. This interpretation is very much in doubt now, and a considerable literature exists on anomalous electron heating due to elec- trojet turbulence. This topic is taken up separately in some detail in Section 10.5.2. As we shall see, the result is that the type 4 waves might still saturate at a phase velocity equal to C s but that the sound velocity is much higher than expected."},{"pageNumber":527,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 519 V P V P V P –1000 Doppler velocity (m /s) 0 V P V P ~ C s (Ion acoustic speed) Width , V P V P ~ C s (Enhanced T e ) Width , V P V P , C s Width .

An example showing the complexity of the radar aurora is given in Fig. 10.25. Consecutive spectra separated by about 6 s are shown from four different ranges. Many examples of broad type 2 Doppler shifts were obtained during this time period, but in addition very strong sporadic echoes were seen which have very large Doppler shifts. The spectra look like type 1 events but have shifts much larger than expected for model values of the temperature and thus the acoustic speed at E region altitudes. These are type 4 echoes. Since the coherent scatter radar data are complicated to interpret, it is impor- tant to determine the zero-order plasma properties and the k spectrum of the waves independently in order to distinguish and understand the various possible plasma instability mechanisms. As in the equatorial case, rocket measurements have been used to add to our knowledge of auroral electrojet instabilities.

The frequency-altitude-intensity format used here shows where the waves occur and their relative intensity. In the bottom right-hand panel ( E dc = 10 mV/m) there is no detectable signal. As the dc electric field strength increases the layer thickness and the intensity both increase dramat- ically. Near the top of the layer a discrete narrow band emission is observed in some cases (e.g., panels a through d). This feature is also apparent in the sequence of discrete spectra in Fig. 10.27, which correspond to the experiment in panel b of Fig. 10.26. At a height of 120 km a very narrow band signal was detected which, except for the exact value of the center frequency, is nearly indistinguish- able from the topside equatorial electrojet spectrum plotted in Fig. 4.30. The value of the center frequency in this coherent feature can vary considerably from flight to flight. This has been explained through the dependence of the Doppler shift of the signal on the rocket velocity vector, the plasma velocity vector, and the acoustic speed in a given flight (Pfaff, 1985). The data seem to indicate a very turbulent “heart” to the electrojet with coherent structures in the upper regions.

This allows longer-wavelength waves to be studied. The electric field data from the latter experiment are shown in Fig. 10.28e. The electric field signal is modulated by the rocket spin. The envelope of this modulation is smoothly varying above about 102 km. Below this height the spin signal is modulated by the geophysical phenomenon of interest here. Analysis indicates that these modulations correspond to roughly a 300 m horizontal wavelength for the electric field fluctuation. These waves occurred in a region of vertical plasma density gradient (see Fig. 10.28a) and of northward dc electric field. This, of course, is the proper orientation for instability of the gradient drift wave. Notice that the waves are localized in altitude even though the near-vertical magnetic field allows very efficient coupling along B . We return to a discussion of this problem and these same data following. 10.5.3 Simultaneous Data Sets As in the equatorial case, significant advances are possible when more than one measurement technique is applied in a given experiment. The data in Fig. 10.28 are of this type, since the incoherent scatter radar at Chatanika was used to provide the electron density profile shown in panel a as well as the ambient electric field. Armed with these data, the vertical profile of V e − V i was calculated (panel b) and the linear theory (see Section 10.6) was used to calculate the growth rate as a function of wave number in panel c. When compared to the electric field wave data in panels d and c, it is clear at once that high-frequency (high k value) waves are observed in the upper electrojet, where the two-stream term dominates.

It is clear from this study that both the gradient drift and the two-stream condition play a role in the auroral electrojet. A controversy over interpretation of the phase velocity of meter-wavelength waves at high latitudes has been resolved by simultaneous coherent scatter radar and incoherent scatter radar observations. The STARE coherent scatter Doppler data at first were interpreted as representing the projection of ( E × B / B 2 )on the radar line of sight. This interpretation agrees with linear theory, since (see Chapter 4) that theory predicts ω ∼ = k · V D /( 1 + \u0013) (10.19) but disagrees with the equatorial electrojet observations, which show that ω/ k = C s at any angle to the current. In view of recent equatorial data showing that Doppler shift velocities match the nonisothermal ionacoustic speed rather than the isothermal (Chapter 4), an application of these equatorial results to high latitudes is now in progress with added consideration for elevated electron and ion temperatures and electron heat flows (L. M. Kagan, personal communica- tion). On the other hand, E × B / B 2 drifts as large as 2000 m/s are not uncommon at high latitudes, so it was not unreasonable to assume that the coherent scatter Doppler shift yields the projection of the E × B velocity. Some of the first evidence that E-region temperatures might be very high came from incoherent scatter observations in Alaska (Schlegel and St.-Maurice, 1981). An example is shown in Fig. 10.29, where T e near 110 km is about three times the neutral gas temperature.

For reference, the sound speed for a mean ion mass of 31 amu, T e = 1200 K, and T i = 500 K is 900 m/s. Simultaneous observations of the plasma drift velocity and the wave phase velocity were made at EISCAT in conjunction with the STARE coherent scatter radar (Nielsen and Schlegel, 1985). The data are compared in Fig. 10.30 for (a) the linear “fluid” model and (b) the “acoustic” model. The acoustic model is clearly in better agreement with the data. The implication is that the waves travel at the speed of C s cos θ , which contradicted the conventional wisdom for equatorial observations that the waves travel at the speed of C s independent of θ . But as discussed in Chapter 4, there is a way to reconcile the results at both latitudes. Nielsen and Schlegel (1985) also found that the acoustic speed is an increasing function of plasma drift and thus the applied electric field. This is also strong evidence for heating. The C s cos θ condition was further supported by simultaneous rocket electric field and 30 MHz radar observatories in Alaska (Bahcivan et al., 2005). The radar used a sophisticated interferometer that allowed cross field of view as well as radial velocities to be determined. They used an empirical relationship between T e and E developed by Nielsen and Schlegel (1985) to determine C s . This work also synthesized our understanding of the relationship between type 1, 2, and 3 waves. They found that at high latitudes the narrow type 1 echoes are only seen when the radar is looking nearly parallel or antiparallel to the electron drift velocity. The Doppler shift is then C s . When there is a reasonable angle to the drift velocity, the spectrum widens, but the mean Doppler shift traces C s cos θ . It seems that as far as strong radar echoes are concerned, at high latitudes type 1 echoes are driven by the two-stream instability.

This interesting nonlinear plasma problem is treated further following. 10.5.4 Summary About 40 years after the first detection and theoretical work on the Farley- Buneman instability, and with combinations of incoherent and coherent scatter radars as well as simultaneous rocket electric field and coherent scatter radar, it seems the experimental description is finally self-consistent at equatorial and high latitudes. At high latitudes we have the following summary: 1. The two-stream instability dominates as a radar echo source. 2. The spectra are narrow when the line of sight is near the electron drift velocity and shifted by C s . 3. At large angles, the main Doppler is C s cos θ and the spectra are broad. 4. For large electric fields, the electron temperature is enhanced and C s rises. 5. The gradient drift instability occurs, as indicated by rocket experiments, but is less important. At equatorial latitudes we have the following summary: 1. Rocket data indicate strong, horizontally propagating, narrow band, two-stream waves at the top of the electrojet where the gradient vanishes. These waves cannot be detected directly by ground-based radars. 2. Vertical echoes from this pure two-stream region (i.e., perpendicular to the elec- tron drift) have broad spectrum with an average Doppler shift of zero which equals C s cos θ . 3. There are altitudes at which the Doppler shift velocities match nonisothermal ion- acoustic speed and are higher than C s . The two-stream processes change from being super-adiabatic at lower electrojet altitudes to becoming isothermal at higher altitudes via a transitional process defined by inelastic electron energy exchange. The latter is important at low frequencies and disappears at high frequencies ≥ 150 MHz. 4. The ubiquitous observation of narrow (type 1) spectra with Doppler shifts equal to C s is due to the simultaneous instability of two-stream and gradient drift processes and the subsequent development of high-amplitude large (kms)-scale waves. The result is that somewhere in the radar scattering volume the ( E × δ E ) × B drift exceeds C s . 5. Below this region, pure gradient drift modes occur due to electric fields and winds having type 2 spectra and travel with speeds ≤ V d cos θ . 10.6 Linear Auroral Electrojet Wave Theories The local linear theory for the gradient drift and two-stream instabilities in the auroral electrojet does not differ very much from its counterpart in the equatorial case (see Chapter 4).

By “local” in this context we mean that we ignore coupling along the magnetic field lines. In the following discussion, we follow the presentation by Fejer and Providakes (1988) quite closely. In the lower E region (between about 90 and 100 km), the ions are unmagne- tized ( ν i << \u000e i ), and the electrons are collisionless to zero order ( \u000e e >> ν e ), so V D = E × B / B 2 . Linear theory then is identical to the result in Chapter 4, and the oscillation frequency and growth rate, in the reference frame of the neutral wind, are given by ω r = k · ( V D + \u0013 V Di ) / ( 1 + \u0013 ) (10.20) γ = ( 1 + \u0013 ) − 1 { ( \u0013/ν i ) [ ( ω r − k · V Di ) 2 − k 2 C 2 s ] + ( 1 / Lk 2 )( ω r − k · V Di ) + ( ν i /\u000e i ) k y } − 2 α n 0 (10.21) where \u0013 = \u0013 0 [( k 2 ⊥ / k 2 ) + ( \u000e 2 e /ν 2 e )( k 2 || / k 2 )] and \u0013 0 = ν e ν i /\u000e e \u000e i In this expression V Di is the ion drift velocity, which could be due either to neutral winds or to the ambient electric field. The assumptions used are ω r << ν i , or in other words that the wavelengths are much larger than the ion mean free path, and | γ | << ω r . In addition, we consider k >> k 0 , where k 0 = (ν i /\u000e i ) [ ( 1 + \u0013) L N ] − 1 , so the linear waves are nondispersive. These approxima- tions are valid for wavelengths between a few meters and a few hundred meters. For shorter wavelengths, kinetic theories are needed. The first term in the right- hand side of (10.21) is the two-stream term, which includes a diffusive damping term of the form k 2 C s . The second term describes the gradient drift instability, while the last term is due to recombinational damping. The two-stream term is dominant at short wavelengths (1 m ≤ λ ≤ 20 m) and yields instability when k · V D > kC s ( 1 + ψ ). For reference a set of high-latitude parameters was chosen and the threshold drift velocity for instability evaluated as a function of wave- length. The results are shown in Fig. 10.31 for k || = 0 at a height of 105 km. The parameters used are ν e = 4 × 10 4 s − 1 , ν i = 2 . 5 × 10 3 s − 1 , \u000e e = 10 7 s − 1 , \u000e i = 180 s − 1 , C s = 360 m/s, and 2 α n 0 = 0 . 06 s − 1 . Several different gradient scale lengths were used. Large-scale waves are easily excited only if the electron density gradient is destabilizing ( L N is negative). Note also that the two-stream threshold drift ( L N =∞ ) increases rapidly with a wavelength for λ ≥ 20 m. Therefore, the two-stream instability mechanism is essentially restricted to short wavelengths."},{"pageNumber":536,"pageContent":"528 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0 20 40 60 80 100 Wavelength (m) 2 10 km 2 30 km 30 km 10 km H 5 105 km L N 5 ` k .

Figure 10.32 illustrates the case when a vertical density gradient exists in the presence of a dip angle which is large but is not equal to 90 ◦ . For example, this situation applies when solar illumination produces the E region plasma or when diffuse auroral precipitation is the source. Then a vertically upward gradient is unstable for a"},{"pageNumber":537,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 529 northward electric field, while a downward gradient is unstable for a southward field. The gradient scale length perpendicular to B is L ⊥ = L N ( cos I ) − 1 , where I is the dip angle. For the same value of L N , L ⊥ is much larger at high latitudes than in the midlatitude or equatorial case. Even when classical sporadic E layers form at high latitudes, the cos I term reduces their importance. Steep horizontal gradients may arise due to very intense localized auroral arcs. However, such arcs have a high electron density, which drastically increases the recombinational damping. Thus, the gradient drift process is less important at high latitudes than elsewhere in the ionosphere. That said, we now proceed to show that the gradients still cannot be totally ignored. In Fig. 10.33 the electron density profile and intermediate to short- wavelength wave data are plotted side by side for two rocket flights through the auroral electrojet. In the upper case, E had a northward component, while in the lower case E was southward. In each case the solid trace on the left shows the true electron density variation with altitude. In the upper plot the wave activ- ity shows a local minimum exactly where the density gradient changes sign. In the lower example the wave activity increases when the vertical density gradi- ent changes sign. The implication is that the electron density gradient controls or at least affects the intensity of electrojet turbulence but that the two-stream process is the dominant source of wave activity. In both of these events the elec- tron drift speed was well over 1000 m/s, much higher than the typical sound speed. One example which clearly seems to show an auroral event in which a domi- nant role is played by the gradient drift instability was shown earlier in Fig. 10.28. Here large-wavelength electric field fluctuations were observed on the bottom- side. The waves are quite intense ( δ E ≈ 25 mV/m) and are polarized in the direc- tion of the E × B drift (Pfaff, 1985). Of course, this low-apogee flight was one of the few rocket experiments capable of detecting large-scale waves on the bot- tomside and thus they may well exist much of the time when the electric field is northward and when the electron density, n 0 , is not so high that recombination dominates. This example is potentially quite interesting because it illustrates the altitude dependence of the wave amplitude. A detailed study of the linear theory for the event has been carried out and the results were plotted in panel c of Fig. 10.28. Indeed, the long-wavelength waves are observed at the same altitude as those where the growth rate in panel c shows positive values at long wavelengths. The observed longest-wavelength waves (panel e) seem to cut off just above 100 km altitude, although the intermediate to short-wavelength waves (panel d) remain strong between 100 and 110 km. We now consider the extent to which these long-wavelength waves map to higher altitudes along the magnetic field lines. The theory of the mapping of elec- trostatic fields (which can include the fields associated with the long-wavelength waves) along magnetic field lines was reviewed in Chapter 2.

In Fig. 10.34 (σ 0 σ P ) 1 / 2 is plotted as a function of altitude using a model neutral atmo- sphere and the geomagnetic field at Poker Flat, Alaska. The computation of this ratio was very sensitive to the particular expression used for the collision frequencies and may vary quite a bit at these low altitudes. In addition, since these collision frequency values depend critically on the electron temperature, which also varies rapidly here, we have plotted two curves corresponding to T e = 500 K and T e = 250 K. Notice that the conductivity ratio changes con- siderably in the region we are considering. For the sake of discussion, consider the value of this ratio at 96 km to be approximately 35. Thus, using (10.22), a 300 m wave would map through a distance of 10.5 km as it decays along the field lines. The calculated distance is somewhat larger than that given by the observations, but the basic idea seems correct. In any event, this calcula- tion is consistent with the hypothesis that the source region of the waves was very narrow in height. In turn, this supports the claim that the waves were produced by a locally unstable electron density gradient and that the observed dominant wavelength may have corresponded to the peak in the linear growth rate for the gradient drift instability. The perturbation electric field mapped to a region where the waves were stable. In Chapter 5 we showed an exam- ple in which waves were detected on only one side of a midlatitude layer for which this condition held (Kelley and Gelinas, 2000). Seyler et al. (2004) devel- oped a nonlocal theory for the midlatitude case, which can deal with such conditions."},{"pageNumber":540,"pageContent":"532 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics 10.6.2 The Two-Stream Instability and Type 4 Radar Echoes Of course, the two-stream instability is very easily excited in the auroral case and it is probably responsible for most radar echoes. The possibility that such waves heat E region electrons to temperatures far in excess of that of the neutral gas makes their study very interesting, since such wave-induced processes are very important in space plasma physics in general. The type 4 observations discussed earlier give evidence for local increases in the ion acoustic speed of up to 900 m/s. For a mean ion mass of 31 amu and an ion temperature of about 500 K, this corresponds to an electron temperature of about 2500 K for isothermal ions and electrons. The temperature would be reduced when electrons are nonisothermal, and slightly reduced for different specific heat ratios. Electron temperatures of this magnitude have been measured with incoherent radars during highly active periods (see Fig. 10.29). Cosmic noise absorption levels measured during events of this type are also consistent with large increases in the effective electron temperature in the locally heated region (Stauning, 1984). Schlegel and St.-Maurice (1981) argued that the large electron temperature enhancements in the unstable electrojet layer cannot be explained by either particle precipitation or classical Joule heating. These enhancements maximize at the height (about 110 km) where two-stream waves are strongest. This led St.-Maurice et al. (1981) to suggest that these waves are responsible for the elec- tron heating throughout the unstable region. Several theories were developed to explain the possible heating of the electron gas by strongly driven two-stream waves. Originally, St.-Maurice et al. (1981) considered a quasi-linear modified two-stream instability theory with the assumption that the wave energy is con- centrated in a narrow band of short-wavelength ( λ ≈ 20 cm) waves where the linear growth rate is a maximum. However, the wave amplitudes necessary to generate the observed electron temperatures are much larger than measured by in situ probes in this wavelength range (e.g., Pfaff et al., 1984). St.-Maurice and Laher (1985) then suggested that heating of the electron gas is caused by par- allel electric fields associated with long-wavelength gradient drift waves, while Primdahl and Bahnsen (1985) emphasized the role of an anomalous collision fre- quency, ν ∗ . Robinson (1986) also considered the heating of the electrons by the perpendicular gradient drift wave component in the presence of anomalous elec- tron collisions. In this formulation, the electron heating rate can also be written dW e / dt | waves = n 0 m ν ∗ ( V D − C s k || / k ) 2 where ν ∗ is the anomalous electron collision frequency. Self-consistent calcula- tions of anomalous electron collision frequencies necessary for the saturation of the two-stream waves and of the corresponding electron temperatures were in excellent agreement with the experimental results. (The concept of a ν ∗ was first proposed by Sudan (1983b), who used it to explain limitation of the wave phase velocity.)"},{"pageNumber":541,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 533 A formula useful for studying electron heating by both collisional and wave- related phenomena has been given by St.-Maurice et al.

The first term includes both the Joule heating due to the zero-order dc field and the Joule heating due to the wave field. Since δ E ≤ E , the first term is anomalous to the extent that ν ∗ >ν e . The second term is entirely due to classical collisions, but the heating electric field in this case is due to the component of δ E parallel to B . This term shows that even a small k || can lead to very efficient heating due to waves. Providakes et al. (1988) have argued that because radar experiments show that k || is large, the latter term is the most important. Furthermore, they point out that anomalous collisions could be included as well in this part of the expression which would increase the heating even more if ν ∗ >ν e . Explaining the large value of k || is probably the single most important theoretical problem at this time. 10.6.3 Type 3 Radar Echoes: Are They Due to Ion Cyclotron Waves? The type 3 observations seem to require additional flexibility in the theoretical analysis. Since there is evidence that such echoes come from the upper E region and are related to field-aligned currents, a general linear dispersion relation has been developed by Fejer et al. (1984a) for primary (directly excited) nearly field- aligned ( k ⊥ >> k || ) waves in the high-latitude E region, including cross-field and field-aligned drifts, ion inertia and magnetization, electron density gradients, and recombination. The general dispersion relation they derived describes the two-stream and gradient drift instability driven by Hall currents in the electrojet region, the magnetized two-stream ion cyclotron instability, which can be driven by either Hall or field-aligned currents between about 120 and 130 km, and the collisional electrostatic ion cyclotron instability driven by field-aligned currents above about 130 km. In addition to the pulsed radar results shown in Fig. 10.24, observations with the University of Saskatchewan CW radar have shown type 3 spectra centered around + 30 and + 55 Hz during several periods of intense magnetic activity in the premidnight sector (Haldoupis et al., 1985). These resonant spectral peaks suggest the existence of cyclotron waves with frequencies the same as gyrofre- quencies of the E region ion constituents (i.e., O + ,O + 2 , and NO + ). The different spectral components are probably generated in separate regions within the scat- tering volume. For field-aligned current-driven waves a positive Doppler shift corresponds to an upward current. These echoes are usually localized in space and time and are associated with substantial increases of the echo power but show very little variation in their Doppler shifts, implying highly coherent wave"},{"pageNumber":542,"pageContent":"534 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics structures. One very significant feature of the observations is the large devia- tion of the scattering wave vector from the plane perpendicular to B . In other words, the waves seem to propagate at angles in the range of 82 to 85 ◦ from B . At such large angles the linear theory described previously indicated that the plasma should be stable. HF radar measurements show that the real part ω is in excellent agreement with ion cyclotron theory (Villain et al., 1987). Interferometer observations generally show the region of type 3 echoes to be associated with horizontal shears in the cross-field plasma flow and with highly localized and irregular structures within the scattering volume. Providakes et al. (1985) reported type 3 echoes along the northern edge of a discrete visible auroral arc. These correspond to the darkened spectral peaks shown in Fig. 10.35. The type 3 echoes were associated with a negative velocity shear W z =− 0 . 5s − 1 , which, as noted earlier in this chapter, suggests the presence of large downward field-aligned currents. Rocket and satellite data show that the edges of auroral arcs are characterized by very large shears, which in turn are associated with intense field-aligned currents of many tens of microamperes per square meter. One theory of electrostatic ion cyclotron (EIC) waves in the auroral iono- sphere has been discussed by many investigators. In particular, Kindel and Ken- nel (1971) derived a kinetic linear dispersion relation for electrostatic waves in a weakly collisional ( ν e < k || V e ) uniformly magnetized plasma. We are interested here, however, in the excitation of EIC waves in the upper E region at wave- lengths for which the electrons are strongly collisional, so the weak collision theory is not appropriate.

(1985) and Satyanarayana and Chaturvedi (1985). These authors have shown that the destabilizing effect of electron collisions is necessary for the excitation of EIC waves in the upper E region, where ion-neutral collisions are stabilizing. Satyanarayana and Chaturvedi (1985) showed that the maximum growth rates for collisional EIC waves in the bottomside ionosphere are comparable to those of collisionless EIC waves above the F region, where ion-neutral collisions are negligible and ion-ion collisions become an important damping mechanism. The critical electron drift velocity to excite EIC waves depends on electron density, on T e / T i and on the ion mass. Figure 10.36 shows three typical ionospheric electron density profiles and the corresponding critical drift velocities for generation of EIC waves. The critical drift velocity has a minimum between 150 and 200 km. This height range is consistent with VHF coherent radar observations. At 150 km the electron thermal speed ( V e ) is about 100 km/s, which gives a threshold parallel drift velocity V D ∼ = 20 km/s. The theories discussed previously indicate that field-aligned drifts of about 30 km/s can excite collisional EIC waves at wavelengths of about 20 m in the upper E region. For an electron density of 5 × 10 4 cm − 3 , this corresponds to a field- aligned current density of about 100 μ A/m 2 . As noted previously, field-aligned currents up to 1000 μ A/m 2 and higher were observed during disturbed condi- tions in highly localized regions near the cusp on the Orsted satellite (Neubert and Christiansen, 2003). Since the currents along the geomagnetic field are alter- natively going up and down, the field-aligned current density averaged over larger scales (as, for example, the spacial resolution of the EISCAT radar) are close to that observed with radar techniques and is about 10 μ A/m 2 .

The most favorable altitude predicted by theory (about 150 km) is consistent with the observations, and the measured frequency range of 50–80 Hz is near the gyrofrequencies of the E-region ion constituents. How- ever, 3 m ion cyclotron waves can be directly excited only by unreasonably large field-aligned drifts (greater than the electron thermal speed). In addition, the theory predicts that for minimum threshold, k || / k = 0 . 007 (aspect angle of 89.6 ◦ ), whereas radar measurements indicate that aspect angles are as small as 80 ◦ ( k || / k ∼ = 0 . 17). The threshold velocity is much larger at these small aspect angles. It is possible that some nonlinear mechanism could generate coherent (resonant) 3 m waves from linearly unstable 20 m waves. In fact, Satyanarayana and Chaturvedi (1985) suggested that ion resonance broadening could provide such a cascade to short wavelengths. However, ion resonance broadening would generate broad spectra (spectral width much greater than \u000e i ) at 3 m and, there- fore, cannot explain the radar data. Seyler and Providakes (1987) performed a numerical simulator that reproduced the type 3 echoes, but considerable work remains before we will finally understand these echoes. 10.6.4 Nonlinear Theories The analytic (turbulence-based) gradient drift instability theory of Sudan and co-workers has already been discussed in Chapter 4, as have the simulation results of McDonald and co-workers. The theory should be applicable to the auroral case, although pure primary gradient drift waves are not as important at high altitudes as they are at the equator and at midlatitudes. In this approach the 3 m waves responsible for 50 MHz backscatter are due to a cascade of energy from unstable long-wavelength waves to stable short-wavelength modes. Because of the interest in electron heating at high latitudes we pursue the case of the nonlinear two-stream wave here. Sudan (1983a, b) has suggested that momentum transfer between electrons and short-wavelength waves leads to an anomalous cross-field diffusion coefficient D ∗ . Since D ∗ is proportional to the collision frequency, there is a corresponding anomalous electron collision frequency ν ∗ that increases with the wave ampli- tude. The nonlinear dispersion relation can be obtained by replacing ν e with ν ∗ . The nonlinear two-stream oscillation frequency and growth rate are then given by ω NL r = k · V D 1 + \u0013 + \u0013 ∗ = kC s (10.23) γ NL = \u0013 + \u0013 ∗ ν i ( 1 + \u0013 + \u0013 ∗ ) [ ( ω NL r ) 2 − k 2 C 2 s ] (10.24)"},{"pageNumber":545,"pageContent":"Instabilities and Structure in the High-Latitude Ionosphere 537 where ω NL r is the nonlinear oscillation frequency and \u0013/\u0013 ∗ = ν/ν ∗ . In this theory the increasing value of \u0013 ∗ in the denominator of (10.23) is what limits the phase velocity to values near marginal stability, ω NL r / k = C s , even though ˆ k · V D is much larger than C s . Large values of ν ∗ /ν e are generally required to keep the two-stream phase velocity equal to C s in the high-latitude electrojet region during periods of large plasma drifts, even though both C s and ν e increase on these occasions. For example, for an altitude of 105 km, using V D = 1000 m/s, C s = 420 m/s, ν e = 10 . 7 × 10 4 s − 1 , \u000e e = 10 7 s − 1 , and \u000e i = 180 s − 1 , we must have ν ∗ ∼ = 18 ν e ∼ = 1 . 5 × 10 6 s − 1 . These magnitudes of ν ∗ e , however, require unreasonably large wave amplitudes. A number of other investigations of the nonlinear stage of instability explain certain nonlinear features of the waves such as phase speed limitation, amplitude saturation, and certain other anomalous features (Hamza and St.-Maurice, 1993; St.-Maurice et al., 1994; Sahr and Fejer, 1996; Moorcroft, 2002; Brexler et al., 2002). The most impressive to date is the work of Otani and Oppenheim (1998) invoking three-wave coupling. This process was suggested previously to explain the strong vertical 50 MHz echoes in the region of equatorial pure two-stream instability (Kudeki et al., 1987), which have a broad spectrum with a mean Doppler shift of zero, and to explain strong, short-wavelength waves with vertical wave vectors in that same region as seen in a rocket experiment (Pfaff et al., 1987). Otani and Oppenheim (1998) presented a simplified three-mode system repro- ducing many of the features seen in both the radar data and the particle simula- tions. The model followed the nonlinear time evolution of three spatial Fourier modes by integrating the two-fluid equations relevant to the Farley-Buneman instability. In equatorial electrojet geometry, the three modes used were a hor- izontally propagating mode, intended to represent the unstable primary mode driven by the electrojet vertical electric field, and two secondary modes travel- ing in oblique directions. The modes were chosen so as to satisfy the resonance condition k 1 + k 2 = k 3 . For typical equatorial electrojet parameters, they found that the simple system generally reached a saturated state characterized by (1) a density perturbation of ∼ 5%, (2) vertically propagating secondary density per- turbations propagating primarily along the density extrema of the primary wave, and (3) a slowing of the primary phase velocity from its linear value down to a value near the sound speed. These are all characteristics common to the satu- rated state observed in particle simulations (Oppenheim and Otani, 1996). The saturated state was also characterized by sinusoidal time dependences of all three modes, to be expected of this type of system. The frequencies of the modes obey the resonance condition ω 1 + ω 2 = ω 3 . Computer simulations of the three-wave system produce steady states in close agreement with those obtained from the analytical method. Despite the fact that the system only contains three modes, a number of features also agree well with observation, including density fluctuation magnitudes ( | δ n | / n 0 = 5%), propaga- tion speeds (clustered around the sound speed), and power falloff as a function"},{"pageNumber":546,"pageContent":"538 The Earth’s Ionosphere: Plasma Physics and Electrodynamics of elevation angle. The spatial distributions of the phases of the electron advec- tion term and electron E × B velocity for the secondary modes lead to the partial cancellation of the destabilizing zero-order electron drift, thereby saturating the Farley-Buneman instability. Built on these results, Bahcivan and Hysell (2006) proposed a theory for type 2 (broad) echoes they observed at an angle to the electron drift (Bahci- van et al., 2005). They propose secondary ion-acoustic structures driven by the electric fields in primary Farley-Buneman waves. In their model, the wave spectra broaden with a mean value equal to C s cos θ . 10.7 Summary In this chapter we only scratched the surface in the plasma physics of high- latitude phenomena. We have in some cases been able to export results from other latitudes, but, in general, the high-latitude regime has added features that complicate the physics. These problems are likely to keep ionospheric plasma physics an exciting discipline for the foreseeable future. References Bahcivan, H., and Hysell, D. L. (2006).

At time t = 0 the layer is perturbed by a ± 1 / 4 km sinusoidal altitude modulation, and the subsequent panels show the growth phase of the E s layer instability. (The cross-sectional plane is rotated about the horizontal southwest-northeast line—(the horizontal axis)—so it contains the magnetic field.) The right-hand panels show the corresponding electric fields at the original layer altitude of 105 km, plotted versus position on the horizontal axis. All scales are kilometers, except for the electric field ordinate, which is mV/m. The integrated Pedersen conductivities of the E s and F layers ( \u0002 PE and \u0002 PF ) and the integrated Hall conductivity of the E s layer ( \u0002 H ) satisfy \u0002 H = 2 . 5 (\u0002 PE + \u0002 PF ) .
