But humans area curious species. We wonder, we seek answers. Living in this vast world that isby turns kind and cruel, and gazing at the immense heavens above, people havealways asked a multitude of questions: How can we understand the world in whichwe find ourselves? How does the universe behave? What is the nature of reality?Where did all this come from? Did the universe need a creator? Most of us do notspend most of our time worrying about these questions, but almost all of usworry about them some of the time.Traditionally these are questions for philosophy, but philosophy is dead.Philosophy has not kept up with modern developments in science, particularlyphysics. Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in ourquest for knowledge. The purpose of this book is to give the answers that aresuggested by recent discoveries and theoretical advances. They lead us to a newpicture of the universe and our place in it that is very different from thetraditional one, and different even from the picture we might have painted justa decade or two ago. Still, the first sketches of the new concept can be tracedback almost a century.According to the traditional conception of the universe, objects move onwell-defined paths and have definite histories. We can specify their preciseposition at each moment in time. Although that account is successful enough foreveryday purposes, it was found in the 1920s that this “classical” picture couldnot account for the seemingly bizarre behavior observed on the atomic andsubatomic scales of existence. Instead it was necessary to adopt a differentframework, called quantum physics. Quantum theories have turned out to beremarkably accurate at predicting events on those scales, while also reproducingthe predictions of the old classical theories when applied to the macroscopicworld of daily life. But quantum and classical physics are based on verydifferent conceptions of physical reality.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_017_r1.jpg]Quantum theories can be formulated in many different ways, but what is probablythe most intuitive description was given by Richard (Dick) Feynman, a colorfulcharacter who worked at the California Institute of Technology and played thebongo drums at a strip joint down the road. According to Feynman, a system hasnot just one history but every possible history. As we seek our answers, we willexplain Feynman’s approach in detail, and employ it to explore the idea that theuniverse itself has no single history, nor even an independent existence. Thatseems like a radical idea, even to many physicists. Indeed, like many notions intoday’s science, it appears to violate common sense. But common sense is basedupon everyday experience, not upon the universe as it is revealed through themarvels of technologies such as those that allow us to gaze deep into the atomor back to the early universe.Until the advent of modern physics it was generally thought that all knowledgeof the world could be obtained through direct observation, that things are whatthey seem, as perceived through our senses. But the spectacular success ofmodern physics, which is based upon concepts such as Feynman’s that clash witheveryday experience, has shown that that is not the case. The naive view ofreality therefore is not compatible with modern physics. To deal with suchparadoxes we shall adopt an approach that we call model-dependent realism. It isbased on the idea that our brains interpret the input from our sensory organs bymaking a model of the world. When such a model is successful at explainingevents, we tend to attribute to it, and to the elements and concepts thatconstitute it, the quality of reality or absolute truth. But there may bedifferent ways in which one could model the same physical situation, with eachemploying different fundamental elements and concepts. If two such physicaltheories or models accurately predict the same events, one cannot be said to bemore real than the other; rather, we are free to use whichever model is mostconvenient.In the history of science we have discovered a sequence of better and bettertheories or models, from Plato to the classical theory of Newton to modernquantum theories. It is natural to ask: Will this sequence eventually reach anend point, an ultimate theory of the universe, that will include all forces andpredict every observation we can make, or will we continue forever findingbetter theories, but never one that cannot be improved upon? We do not yet havea definitive answer to this question, but we now have a candidate for theultimate theory of everything, if indeed one exists, called M-theory. M-theoryis the only model that has all the properties we think the final theory ought tohave, and it is the theory upon which much of our later discussion is based.M-theory is not a theory in the usual sense. It is a whole family of differenttheories, each of which is a good description of observations only in some rangeof physical situations. It is a bit like a map. As is well known, one cannotshow the whole of the earth’s surface on a single map. The usual Mercatorprojection used for maps of the world makes areas appear larger and larger inthe far north and south and doesn’t cover the North and South Poles. Tofaithfully map the entire earth, one has to use a collection of maps, each ofwhich covers a limited region. The maps overlap each other, and where they do,they show the same landscape. M-theory is similar. The different theories in theM-theory family may look very different, but they can all be regarded as aspectsof the same underlying theory. They are versions of the theory that areapplicable only in limited ranges—for example, when certain quantities such asenergy are small. Like the overlapping maps in a Mercator projection, where theranges of different versions overlap, they predict the same phenomena. But justas there is no flat map that is a good representation of the earth’s entiresurface, there is no single theory that is a good representation of observationsin all situations.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_018_r1.jpg]We will describe how M-theory may offer answers to the question of creation.According to M-theory, ours is not the only universe. Instead, M-theory predictsthat a great many universes were created out of nothing. Their creation does notrequire the intervention of some supernatural being or god. Rather, thesemultiple universes arise naturally from physical law. They are a prediction ofscience. Each universe has many possible histories and many possible states atlater times, that is, at times like the present, long after their creation. Mostof these states will be quite unlike the universe we observe and quiteunsuitable for the existence of any form of life. Only a very few would allowcreatures like us to exist. Thus our presence selects out from this vast arrayonly those universes that are compatible with our existence. Although we arepuny and insignificant on the scale of the cosmos, this makes us in a sense thelords of creation.To understand the universe at the deepest level, we need to know not only howthe universe behaves, but why.Why is there something rather than nothing?Why do we exist?Why this particular set of laws and not some other?This is the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. We shallattempt to answer it in this book. Unlike the answer given in The Hitchhiker’sGuide to the Galaxy, ours won’t be simply “42.” [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_089_r1.jpg] [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_019_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_020_r1.jpg] Skoll the wolf who shall scare the MoonTill he flies to the Wood-of-Woe:Hati the wolf, Hridvitnir’s kin,Who shall pursue the sun.—“GRIMNISMAL,” The Elder Edda[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_021_r1.jpg]N VIKING MYTHOLOGY, Skoll and Hatichase the sun and the moon. When the wolves catch either one, there is aneclipse. When this happens, the people on earth rush to rescue the sun or moonby making as much noise as they can in hopes of scaring off the wolves. Thereare similar myths in other cultures. But after a time people must have noticedthat the sun and moon soon emerged from the eclipse regardless of whether theyran around screaming and banging on things. After a time they must also havenoticed that the eclipses didn’t just happen at random: They occurred in regularpatterns that repeated themselves. These patterns were most obvious for eclipsesof the moon and enabled the ancient Babylonians to predict lunar eclipses fairlyaccurately even though they didn’t realize that they were caused by the earthblocking the light of the sun. Eclipses of the sun were more difficult topredict because they are visible only in a corridor on the earth about 30 mileswide. Still, once grasped, the patterns made it clear the eclipses were notdependent on the arbitrary whims of supernatural beings, but rather governed bylaws.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_022_r1.jpg]Despite some early success predicting the motion of celestial bodies, mostevents in nature appeared to our ancestors to be impossible to predict.Volcanoes, earthquakes, storms, pestilences, and ingrown toenails all seemed tooccur without obvious cause or pattern. In ancient times it was natural toascribe the violent acts of nature to a pantheon of mischievous or malevolentdeities. Calamities were often taken as a sign that we had somehow offended thegods. For example, in about 5600 BC the Mount Mazama volcano in Oregon erupted,raining rock and burning ash for years, and leading to the many years ofrainfall that eventually filled the volcanic crater today called Crater Lake.The Klamath Indians of Oregon have a legend that faithfully matches everygeologic detail of the event but adds a bit of drama by portraying a human asthe cause of the catastrophe. The human capacity for guilt is such that peoplecan always find ways to blame themselves. As the legend goes, Llao, the chief ofthe Below World, falls in love with the beautiful human daughter of a Klamathchief. She spurns him, and in revenge Llao tries to destroy the Klamath withfire. Luckily, according to the legend, Skell, the chief of the Above World,pities the humans and does battle with his underworld counterpart. EventuallyLlao, injured, falls back inside Mount Mazama, leaving a huge hole, the craterthat eventually filled with water.Ignorance of nature’s ways led people in ancient times to invent gods to lord itover every aspect of human life. There were gods of love and war; of the sun,earth, and sky; of the oceans and rivers; of rain and thunderstorms; even ofearthquakes and volcanoes. When the gods were pleased, mankind was treated togood weather, peace, and freedom from natural disaster and disease. When theywere displeased, there came drought, war, pestilence, and epidemics. Since theconnection of cause and effect in nature was invisible to their eyes, these godsappeared inscrutable, and people at their mercy. But with Thales of Miletus (ca.624 BC– ca. 546 BC) about 2,600 years ago, that began to change. The idea arosethat nature follows consistent principles that could be deciphered. And so beganthe long process of replacing the notion of the reign of gods with the conceptof a universe that is governed by laws of nature, and created according to ablueprint we could someday learn to read.Viewed on the timeline of human history, scientific inquiry is a very newendeavor. Our species, Homo sapiens, originated in sub-Saharan Africa around200,000 BC. Written language dates back only to about 7000 BC, the product ofsocieties centered around the cultivation of grain. (Some of the oldest writteninscriptions concern the daily ration of beer allowed to each citizen.) Theearliest written records from the great civilization of ancient Greece date backto the ninth century BC, but the height of that civilization, the “classicalperiod,” came several hundred years later, beginning a little before 500 BC.According to Aristotle (384 BC–322 BC), it was around that time that Thalesfirst developed the idea that the world can be understood, that the complexhappenings around us could be reduced to simpler principles and explainedwithout resorting to mythical or theological explanations.Thales is credited with the first prediction of a solar eclipse in 585 BC,though the great precision of his prediction was probably a lucky guess. He wasa shadowy figure who left behind no writings of his own. His home was one of theintellectual centers in a region called Ionia, which was colonized by the Greeksand exerted an influence that eventually reached from Turkey as far west asItaly. Ionian science was an endeavor marked by a strong interest in uncoveringfundamental laws to explain natural phenomena, a tremendous milestone in thehistory of human ideas. Their approach was rational and in many cases led toconclusions surprisingly similar to what our more sophisticated methods have ledus to believe today. It represented a grand beginning. But over the centuriesmuch of Ionian science would be forgotten—only to be rediscovered or reinvented,sometimes more than once.According to legend, the first mathematical formulation of what we might todaycall a law of nature dates back to an Ionian named Pythagoras (ca. 580 BC–ca.490 BC), famous for the theorem named after him: that the square of thehypotenuse (longest side) of a right triangle equals the sum of the squares ofthe other two sides. Pythagoras is said to have discovered the numericalrelationship between the length of the strings used in musical instruments andthe harmonic combinations of the sounds. In today’s language we would describethat relationship by saying that the frequency—the number of vibrations persecond—of a string vibrating under fixed tension is inversely proportional tothe length of the string. From the practical point of view, this explains whybass guitars must have longer strings than ordinary guitars. Pythagoras probablydid not really discover this—he also did not discover the theorem that bears hisname—but there is evidence that some relation between string length and pitchwas known in his day. If so, one could call that simple mathematical formula thefirst instance of what we now know as theoretical physics.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_023_r1.jpg]Apart from the Pythagorean law of strings, the only physical laws knowncorrectly to the ancients were three laws detailed by Archimedes (ca. 287 BC–ca.212 BC), by far the most eminent physicist of antiquity. In today’s terminology,the law of the lever explains that small forces can lift large weights becausethe lever amplifies a force according to the ratio of the distances from thelever’s fulcrum. The law of buoyancy states that any object immersed in a fluidwill experience an upward force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. Andthe law of reflection asserts that the angle between a beam of light and amirror is equal to the angle between the mirror and the reflected beam. ButArchimedes did not call them laws, nor did he explain them with reference toobservation and measurement. Instead he treated them as if they were purelymathematical theorems, in an axiomatic system much like the one Euclid createdfor geometry.As the Ionian influence spread, there appeared others who saw that the universepossesses an internal order, one that could be understood through observationand reason. Anaximander (ca. 610 BC–ca. 546 BC), a friend and possibly a studentof Thales, argued that since human infants are helpless at birth, if the firsthuman had somehow appeared on earth as an infant, it would not have survived. Inwhat may have been humanity’s first inkling of evolution, people, Anaximanderreasoned, must therefore have evolved from other animals whose young arehardier. In Sicily, Empedocles (ca. 490 BC–ca. 430 BC) observed the use of aninstrument called a clepsydra. Sometimes used as a ladle, it consisted of asphere with an open neck and small holes in its bottom. When immersed in waterit would fill, and if the open neck was then covered, the clepsydra could belifted out without the water in it falling through the holes. Empedocles noticedthat if you cover the neck before you immerse it, a clepsydra does not fill. Hereasoned that something invisible must be preventing the water from entering thesphere through the holes—he had discovered the material substance we call air.Around the same time Democritus (ca 460 BC–ca. 370 BC), from an Ionian colony innorthern Greece, pondered what happened when you break or cut an object intopieces. He argued that you ought not to be able to continue the processindefinitely. Instead he postulated that everything, including all livingbeings, is made of fundamental particles that cannot be cut or broken intoparts. He named these ultimate particles atoms, from the Greek adjective meaning“uncuttable.” Democritus believed that every material phenomenon is a product ofthe collision of atoms. In his view, dubbed atomism, all atoms move around inspace, and, unless disturbed, move forward indefinitely. Today that idea iscalled the law of inertia.The revolutionary idea that we are but ordinary inhabitants of the universe, notspecial beings distinguished by existing at its center, was first championed byAristarchus (ca. 310 BC–ca. 230 BC), one of the last of the Ionian scientists.Only one of his calculations survives, a complex geometric analysis of carefulobservations he made of the size of the earth’s shadow on the moon during alunar eclipse. He concluded from his data that the sun must be much larger thanthe earth. Perhaps inspired by the idea that tiny objects ought to orbit mammothones and not the other way around, he became the first person to argue that theearth is not the center of our planetary system, but rather that it and theother planets orbit the much larger sun. It is a small step from the realizationthat the earth is just another planet to the idea that our sun is nothingspecial either. Aristarchus suspected that this was the case and believed thatthe stars we see in the night sky are actually nothing more than distant suns.The Ionians were but one of many schools of ancient Greek philosophy, each withdifferent and often contradictory traditions. Unfortunately, the Ionians’ viewof nature—that it can be explained through general laws and reduced to a simpleset of principles—exerted a powerful influence for only a few centuries. Onereason is that Ionian theories often seemed to have no place for the notion offree will or purpose, or the concept that gods intervene in the workings of theworld. These were startling omissions as profoundly unsettling to many Greekthinkers as they are to many people today. The philosopher Epicurus (341 BC–270BC), for example, opposed atomism on the grounds that it is “better to followthe myths about the gods than to become a ‘slave’ to the destiny of naturalphilosophers.” Aristotle too rejected the concept of atoms because he could notaccept that human beings were composed of soulless, inanimate objects. TheIonian idea that the universe is not human-centered was a milestone in ourunderstanding of the cosmos, but it was an idea that would be dropped and notpicked up again, or commonly accepted, until Galileo, almost twenty centurieslater.As insightful as some of their speculations about nature were, most of the ideasof the ancient Greeks would not pass muster as valid science in modern times.For one, because the Greeks had not invented the scientific method, theirtheories were not developed with the goal of experimental verification. So ifone scholar claimed an atom moved in a straight line until it collided with asecond atom and another scholar claimed it moved in a straight line until itbumped into a cyclops, there was no objective way to settle the argument. Also,there was no clear distinction between human and physical laws. In the fifthcentury BC, for instance, Anaximander wrote that all things arise from a primarysubstance, and return to it, lest they “pay fine and penalty for theiriniquity.” And according to the Ionian philosopher Heraclitus (ca. 535 BC–ca.475 BC), the sun behaves as it does because otherwise the goddess of justicewill hunt it down. Several hundred years later the Stoics, a school of Greekphilosophers that arose around the third century BC, did make a distinctionbetween human statutes and natural laws, but they included rules of humanconduct they considered universal—such as veneration of God and obedience toparents—in the category of natural laws. Conversely, they often describedphysical processes in legal terms and believed them to be in need ofenforcement, even though the objects required to “obey” the laws were inanimate.If you think it is hard to get humans to follow traffic laws, imagine convincingan asteroid to move along an ellipse.This tradition continued to influence the thinkers who succeeded the Greeks formany centuries thereafter. In the thirteenth century the early Christianphilosopher Thomas Aquinas (ca. 1225–1274) adopted this view and used it toargue for the existence of God, writing, “It is clear that [inanimate bodies]reach their end not by chance but by intention…. There is therefore, anintelligent personal being by whom everything in nature is ordered to its end.”Even as late as the sixteenth century, the great German astronomer JohannesKepler (1571–1630) believed that planets had sense perception and consciouslyfollowed laws of movement that were grasped by their “mind.”The notion that the laws of nature had to be intentionally obeyed reflects theancients’ focus on why nature behaves as it does, rather than on how it behaves.Aristotle was one of the leading proponents of that approach, rejecting the ideaof science based principally on observation. Precise measurement andmathematical calculation were in any case difficult in ancient times. The baseten number notation we find so convenient for arithmetic dates back only toaround AD 700, when the Hindus took the first great strides toward making thatsubject a powerful tool. The abbreviations for plus and minus didn’t come untilthe fifteenth century. And neither the equal sign nor clocks that could measuretimes to the second existed before the sixteenth century.Aristotle, however, did not see problems in measurement and calculation asimpediments to developing a physics that could produce quantitative predictions.Rather, he saw no need to make them. Instead, Aristotle built his physics uponprinciples that appealed to him intellectually. He suppressed facts he foundunappealing and focused his efforts on the reasons things happen, withrelatively little energy invested in detailing exactly what was happening.Aristotle did adjust his conclusions when their blatant disagreement withobservation could not be ignored. But those adjustments were often ad hocexplanations that did little more than paste over the contradiction. In thatmanner, no matter how severely his theory deviated from actuality, he couldalways alter it just enough to seem to remove the conflict. For example, histheory of motion specified that heavy bodies fall with a constant speed that isproportional to their weight. To explain the fact that objects clearly pick upspeed as they fall, he invented a new principle—that bodies proceed morejubilantly, and hence accelerate, when they come closer to their natural placeof rest, a principle that today seems a more apt description of certain peoplethan of inanimate objects. Though Aristotle’s theories often had littlepredictive value, his approach to science dominated Western thought for nearlytwo thousand years.The Greeks’ Christian successors rejected the idea that the universe is governedby indifferent natural law. They also rejected the idea that humans do not holda privileged place within that universe. And though the medieval period had nosingle coherent philosophical system, a common theme was that the universe isGod’s dollhouse, and religion a far worthier study than the phenomena of nature.Indeed, in 1277 Bishop Tempier of Paris, acting on the instructions of Pope JohnXXI, published a list of 219 errors or heresies that were to be condemned. Amongthe heresies was the idea that nature follows laws, because this conflicts withGod’s omnipotence. Interestingly, Pope John was killed by the effects of the lawof gravity a few months later when the roof of his palace fell in on him.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_024_r1.jpg]The modern concept of laws of nature emerged in the seventeenth century. Keplerseems to have been the first scientist to understand the term in the sense ofmodern science, though as we’ve said, he retained an animistic view of physicalobjects. Galileo (1564–1642) did not use the term “law” in his most scientificworks (though it appears in some translations of those works). Whether or not heused the word, however, Galileo did uncover a great many laws, and advocated theimportant principles that observation is the basis of science and that thepurpose of science is to research the quantitative relationships that existbetween physical phenomena. But the person who first explicitly and rigorouslyformulated the concept of laws of nature as we understand them was RenéDescartes (1596–1650).Descartes believed that all physical phenomena must be explained in terms of thecollisions of moving masses, which were governed by three laws—precursors ofNewton’s famous laws of motion. He asserted that those laws of nature were validin all places and at all times, and stated explicitly that obedience to theselaws does not imply that these moving bodies have minds. Descartes alsounderstood the importance of what we today call “initial conditions.” Thosedescribe the state of a system at the beginning of whatever interval of timeover which one seeks to make predictions. With a given set of initialconditions, the laws of nature determine how a system will evolve over time, butwithout a specific set of initial conditions, the evolution cannot be specified.If, for example, at time zero a pigeon directly overhead lets something go, thepath of that falling object is determined by Newton’s laws. But the outcome willbe very different depending on whether, at time zero, the pigeon is sittingstill on a telephone wire or flying by at 20 miles per hour. In order to applythe laws of physics one must know how a system started off, or at least itsstate at some definite time. (One can also use the laws to follow a systembackward in time.)With this renewed belief in the existence of laws of nature came new attempts toreconcile those laws with the concept of God. According to Descartes, God couldat will alter the truth or falsity of ethical propositions or mathematicaltheorems, but not nature. He believed that God ordained the laws of nature buthad no choice in the laws; rather, he picked them because the laws we experienceare the only possible laws. This would seem to impinge on God’s authority, butDescartes got around that by arguing that the laws are unalterable because theyare a reflection of God’s own intrinsic nature. If that were true, one mightthink that God still had the choice of creating a variety of different worlds,each corresponding to a different set of initial conditions, but Descartes alsodenied this. No matter what the arrangement of matter at the beginning of theuniverse, he argued, over time a world identical to ours would evolve. Moreover,Descartes felt, once God set the world going, he left it entirely alone.A similar position (with some exceptions) was adopted by Isaac Newton(1643–1727). Newton was the person who won widespread acceptance of the modernconcept of a scientific law with his three laws of motion and his law ofgravity, which accounted for the orbits of the earth, moon, and planets, andexplained phenomena such as the tides. The handful of equations he created, andthe elaborate mathematical framework we have since derived from them, are stilltaught today, and employed whenever an architect designs a building, an engineerdesigns a car, or a physicist calculates how to aim a rocket meant to land onMars. As the poet Alexander Pope said:Nature and Nature’s laws lay hid in night:God said, Let Newton be! and all was light.Today most scientists would say a law of nature is a rule that is based upon anobserved regularity and provides predictions that go beyond the immediatesituations upon which it is based. For example, we might notice that the sun hasrisen in the east every morning of our lives, and postulate the law “The sunalways rises in the east.” This is a generalization that goes beyond our limitedobservations of the rising sun and makes testable predictions about the future.On the other hand, a statement such as “The computers in this office are black”is not a law of nature because it relates only to the computers within theoffice and makes no predictions such as “If my office purchases a new computer,it will be black.”Our modern understanding of the term “law of nature” is an issue philosophersargue at length, and it is a more subtle question than one may at first think.For example, the philosopher John W. Carroll compared the statement “All goldspheres are less than a mile in diameter” to a statement like “All uranium-235spheres are less than a mile in diameter.” Our observations of the world tell usthat there are no gold spheres larger than a mile wide, and we can be prettyconfident there never will be. Still, we have no reason to believe that therecouldn’t be one, and so the statement is not considered a law. On the otherhand, the statement “All uranium-235 spheres are less than a mile in diameter”could be thought of as a law of nature because, according to what we know aboutnuclear physics, once a sphere of uranium-235 grew to a diameter greater thanabout six inches, it would demolish itself in a nuclear explosion. Hence we canbe sure that such spheres do not exist. (Nor would it be a good idea to try tomake one!) This distinction matters because it illustrates that not allgeneralizations we observe can be thought of as laws of nature, and that mostlaws of nature exist as part of a larger, interconnected system of laws.In modern science laws of nature are usually phrased in mathematics. They can beeither exact or approximate, but they must have been observed to hold withoutexception—if not universally, then at least under a stipulated set ofconditions. For example, we now know that Newton’s laws must be modified ifobjects are moving at velocities near the speed of light. Yet we still considerNewton’s laws to be laws because they hold, at least to a very goodapproximation, for the conditions of the everyday world, in which the speeds weencounter are far below the speed of light.If nature is governed by laws, three questions arise: 1. What is the origin of the laws? 2. Are there any exceptions to the laws, i.e., miracles? 3. Is there only one set of possible laws? These important questions have been addressed in varying ways by scientists,philosophers, and theologians. The answer traditionally given to the firstquestion—the answer of Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Newton—was that the lawswere the work of God. However, this is no more than a definition of God as theembodiment of the laws of nature. Unless one endows God with some otherattributes, such as being the God of the Old Testament, employing God as aresponse to the first question merely substitutes one mystery for another. So ifwe involve God in the answer to the first question, the real crunch comes withthe second question: Are there miracles, exceptions to the laws?Opinions about the answer to the second question have been sharply divided.Plato and Aristotle, the most influential ancient Greek writers, held that therecan be no exceptions to the laws. But if one takes the biblical view, then Godnot only created the laws but can be appealed to by prayer to make exceptions—toheal the terminally ill, to bring premature ends to droughts, or to reinstatecroquet as an Olympic sport. In opposition to Descartes’s view, almost allChristian thinkers maintained that God must be able to suspend the laws toaccomplish miracles. Even Newton believed in miracles of a sort. He thought thatthe orbit of the planets would be unstable because the gravitational attractionof one planet for another would cause disturbances to the orbits that would growwith time and would result in the planets either falling into the sun or beingflung out of the solar system. God must keep on resetting the orbits, hebelieved, or “wind the celestial watch, lest it run down.” However,Pierre-Simon, marquis de Laplace (1749–1827), commonly known as Laplace, arguedthat the perturbations would be periodic, that is, marked by repeated cycles,rather than being cumulative. The solar system would thus reset itself, andthere would be no need for divine intervention to explain why it had survived tothe present day.It is Laplace who is usually credited with first clearly postulating scientificdeterminism: Given the state of the universe at one time, a complete set of lawsfully determines both the future and the past. This would exclude thepossibility of miracles or an active role for God. The scientific determinismthat Laplace formulated is the modern scientist’s answer to question two. It is,in fact, the basis of all modern science, and a principle that is importantthroughout this book. A scientific law is not a scientific law if it holds onlywhen some supernatural being decides not to intervene. Recognizing this,Napoleon is said to have asked Laplace how God fit into this picture. Laplacereplied: “Sire, I have not needed that hypothesis.”Since people live in the universe and interact with the other objects in it,scientific determinism must hold for people as well. Many, however, whileaccepting that scientific determinism governs physical processes, would make anexception for human behavior because they believe we have free will. Descartes,for instance, in order to preserve the idea of free will, asserted that thehuman mind was something different from the physical world and did not followits laws. In his view a person consists of two ingredients, a body and a soul.Bodies are nothing but ordinary machines, but the soul is not subject toscientific law. Descartes was very interested in anatomy and physiology andregarded a tiny organ in the center of the brain, called the pineal gland, asthe principal seat of the soul. That gland, he believed, was the place where allour thoughts are formed, the wellspring of our free will.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_025_r1.jpg]Do people have free will? If we have free will, where in the evolutionary treedid it develop? Do blue-green algae or bacteria have free will, or is theirbehavior automatic and within the realm of scientific law? Is it onlymulticelled organisms that have free will, or only mammals? We might think thata chimpanzee is exercising free will when it chooses to chomp on a banana, or acat when it rips up your sofa, but what about the roundworm calledCaenorhabditis elegans—a simple creature made of only 959 cells? It probablynever thinks, “That was damn tasty bacteria I got to dine on back there,” yet ittoo has a definite preference in food and will either settle for an unattractivemeal or go foraging for something better, depending on recent experience. Isthat the exercise of free will?Though we feel that we can choose what we do, our understanding of the molecularbasis of biology shows that biological processes are governed by the laws ofphysics and chemistry and therefore are as determined as the orbits of theplanets. Recent experiments in neuroscience support the view that it is ourphysical brain, following the known laws of science, that determines ouractions, and not some agency that exists outside those laws. For example, astudy of patients undergoing awake brain surgery found that by electricallystimulating the appropriate regions of the brain, one could create in thepatient the desire to move the hand, arm, or foot, or to move the lips and talk.It is hard to imagine how free will can operate if our behavior is determined byphysical law, so it seems that we are no more than biological machines and thatfree will is just an illusion.While conceding that human behavior is indeed determined by the laws of nature,it also seems reasonable to conclude that the outcome is determined in such acomplicated way and with so many variables as to make it impossible in practiceto predict. For that one would need a knowledge of the initial state of each ofthe thousand trillion trillion molecules in the human body and to solvesomething like that number of equations. That would take a few billion years,which would be a bit late to duck when the person opposite aimed a blow.Because it is so impractical to use the underlying physical laws to predicthuman behavior, we adopt what is called an effective theory. In physics, aneffective theory is a framework created to model certain observed phenomenawithout describing in detail all of the underlying processes. For example, wecannot solve exactly the equations governing the gravitational interactions ofevery atom in a person’s body with every atom in the earth. But for allpractical purposes the gravitational force between a person and the earth can bedescribed in terms of just a few numbers, such as the person’s total mass.Similarly, we cannot solve the equations governing the behavior of complex atomsand molecules, but we have developed an effective theory called chemistry thatprovides an adequate explanation of how atoms and molecules behave in chemicalreactions without accounting for every detail of the interactions. In the caseof people, since we cannot solve the equations that determine our behavior, weuse the effective theory that people have free will. The study of our will, andof the behavior that arises from it, is the science of psychology. Economics isalso an effective theory, based on the notion of free will plus the assumptionthat people evaluate their possible alternative courses of action and choose thebest. That effective theory is only moderately successful in predicting behaviorbecause, as we all know, decisions are often not rational or are based on adefective analysis of the consequences of the choice. That is why the world isin such a mess.The third question addresses the issue of whether the laws that determine boththe universe and human behavior are unique. If your answer to the first questionis that God created the laws, then this question asks, did God have any latitudein choosing them? Both Aristotle and Plato believed, like Descartes and laterEinstein, that the principles of nature exist out of “necessity,” that is,because they are the only rules that make logical sense. Due to his belief inthe origin of the laws of nature in logic, Aristotle and his followers felt thatone could “derive” those laws without paying a lot of attention to how natureactually behaved. That, and the focus on why objects follow rules rather than onthe specifics of what the rules are, led him to mainly qualitative laws thatwere often wrong and in any case did not prove very useful, even if they diddominate scientific thought for many centuries. It was only much later thatpeople such as Galileo dared to challenge the authority of Aristotle and observewhat nature actually did, rather than what pure “reason” said it ought to do.This book is rooted in the concept of scientific determinism, which implies thatthe answer to question two is that there are no miracles, or exceptions to thelaws of nature. We will, however, return to address in depth questions one andthree, the issues of how the laws arose and whether they are the only possiblelaws. But first, in the next chapter, we will address the issue of what it isthat the laws of nature describe. Most scientists would say they are themathematical reflection of an external reality that exists independent of theobserver who sees it. But as we ponder the manner in which we observe and formconcepts about our surroundings, we bump into the question, do we really havereason to believe that an objective reality exists? [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_089_r1.jpg] [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_026_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_027_r1.jpg] [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_028_r1.jpg]FEW YEARS AGO the city council ofMonza, Italy, barred pet owners from keeping goldfish in curved goldfish bowls.The measure’s sponsor explained the measure in part by saying that it is cruelto keep a fish in a bowl with curved sides because, gazing out, the fish wouldhave a distorted view of reality. But how do we know we have the true,undistorted picture of reality? Might not we ourselves also be inside some biggoldfish bowl and have our vision distorted by an enormous lens? The goldfish’spicture of reality is different from ours, but can we be sure it is less real?The goldfish view is not the same as our own, but goldfish could still formulatescientific laws governing the motion of the objects they observe outside theirbowl. For example, due to the distortion, a freely moving object that we wouldobserve to move in a straight line would be observed by the goldfish to movealong a curved path. Nevertheless, the goldfish could formulate scientific lawsfrom their distorted frame of reference that would always hold true and thatwould enable them to make predictions about the future motion of objects outsidethe bowl. Their laws would be more complicated than the laws in our frame, butsimplicity is a matter of taste. If a goldfish formulated such a theory, wewould have to admit the goldfish’s view as a valid picture of reality.A famous example of different pictures of reality is the model introduced aroundAD 150 by Ptolemy (ca. 85—ca. 165) to describe the motion of the celestialbodies. Ptolemy published his work in a thirteen-book treatise usually knownunder its Arabic title, Almagest. The Almagest begins by explaining reasons forthinking that the earth is spherical, motionless, positioned at the center ofthe universe, and negligibly small in comparison to the distance of the heavens.Despite Aristarchus’s heliocentric model, these beliefs had been held by mosteducated Greeks at least since the time of Aristotle, who believed for mysticalreasons that the earth should be at the center of the universe. In Ptolemy’smodel the earth stood still at the center and the planets and the stars movedaround it in complicated orbits involving epicycles, like wheels on wheels.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_029_r1.jpg]This model seemed natural because we don’t feel the earth under our feet moving(except in earthquakes or moments of passion). Later European learning was basedon the Greek sources that had been passed down, so that the ideas of Aristotleand Ptolemy became the basis for much of Western thought. Ptolemy’s model of thecosmos was adopted by the Catholic Church and held as official doctrine forfourteen hundred years. It was not until 1543 that an alternative model was putforward by Copernicus in his book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On theRevolutions of the Celestial Spheres), published only in the year of his death(though he had worked on his theory for several decades).Copernicus, like Aristarchus some seventeen centuries earlier, described a worldin which the sun was at rest and the planets revolved around it in circularorbits. Though the idea wasn’t new, its revival was met with passionateresistance. The Copernican model was held to contradict the Bible, which wasinterpreted as saying that the planets moved around the earth, even though theBible never clearly stated that. In fact, at the time the Bible was writtenpeople believed the earth was flat. The Copernican model led to a furious debateas to whether the earth was at rest, culminating in Galileo’s trial for heresyin 1633 for advocating the Copernican model, and for thinking “that one may holdand defend as probable an opinion after it has been declared and definedcontrary to the Holy Scripture.” He was found guilty, confined to house arrestfor the rest of his life, and forced to recant. He is said to have mutteredunder his breath “Eppur si muove,” “But still it moves.” In 1992 the RomanCatholic Church finally acknowledged that it had been wrong to condemn Galileo.So which is real, the Ptolemaic or Copernican system? Although it is notuncommon for people to say that Copernicus proved Ptolemy wrong, that is nottrue. As in the case of our normal view versus that of the goldfish, one can useeither picture as a model of the universe, for our observations of the heavenscan be explained by assuming either the earth or the sun to be at rest. Despiteits role in philosophical debates over the nature of our universe, the realadvantage of the Copernican system is simply that the equations of motion aremuch simpler in the frame of reference in which the sun is at rest.A different kind of alternative reality occurs in the science fiction film TheMatrix, in which the human race is unknowingly living in a simulated virtualreality created by intelligent computers to keep them pacified and content whilethe computers suck their bioelectrical energy (whatever that is). Maybe this isnot so far-fetched, because many people prefer to spend their time in thesimulated reality of websites such as Second Life. How do we know we are notjust characters in a computer-generated soap opera? If we lived in a syntheticimaginary world, events would not necessarily have any logic or consistency orobey any laws. The aliens in control might find it more interesting or amusingto see our reactions, for example, if the full moon split in half, or everyonein the world on a diet developed an uncontrollable craving for banana cream pie.But if the aliens did enforce consistent laws, there is no way we could tellthere was another reality behind the simulated one. It would be easy to call theworld the aliens live in the “real” one and the synthetic world a “false” one.But if—like us—the beings in the simulated world could not gaze into theiruniverse from the outside, there would be no reason for them to doubt their ownpictures of reality. This is a modern version of the idea that we are allfigments of someone else’s dream.These examples bring us to a conclusion that will be important in this book:There is no picture- or theory-independent concept of reality. Instead we willadopt a view that we will call model-dependent realism: the idea that a physicaltheory or world picture is a model (generally of a mathematical nature) and aset of rules that connect the elements of the model to observations. Thisprovides a framework with which to interpret modern science.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_030_r1.jpg]Philosophers from Plato onward have argued over the years about the nature ofreality. Classical science is based on the belief that there exists a realexternal world whose properties are definite and independent of the observer whoperceives them. According to classical science, certain objects exist and havephysical properties, such as speed and mass, that have well-defined values. Inthis view our theories are attempts to describe those objects and theirproperties, and our measurements and perceptions correspond to them. Bothobserver and observed are parts of a world that has an objective existence, andany distinction between them has no meaningful significance. In other words, ifyou see a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parking garage, it isbecause there really is a herd of zebras fighting for a spot in the parkinggarage. All other observers who look will measure the same properties, and theherd will have those properties whether anyone observes them or not. Inphilosophy that belief is called realism.Though realism may be a tempting viewpoint, as we’ll see later, what we knowabout modern physics makes it a difficult one to defend. For example, accordingto the principles of quantum physics, which is an accurate description ofnature, a particle has neither a definite position nor a definite velocityunless and until those quantities are measured by an observer. It is thereforenot correct to say that a measurement gives a certain result because thequantity being measured had that value at the time of the measurement. In fact,in some cases individual objects don’t even have an independent existence butrather exist only as part of an ensemble of many. And if a theory called theholographic principle proves correct, we and our four-dimensional world may beshadows on the boundary of a larger, five-dimensional space-time. In that case,our status in the universe is analogous to that of the goldfish.Strict realists often argue that the proof that scientific theories representreality lies in their success. But different theories can successfully describethe same phenomenon through disparate conceptual frameworks. In fact, manyscientific theories that had proven successful were later replaced by other,equally successful theories based on wholly new concepts of reality.Traditionally those who didn’t accept realism have been called anti-realists.Anti-realists suppose a distinction between empirical knowledge and theoreticalknowledge. They typically argue that observation and experiment are meaningfulbut that theories are no more than useful instruments that do not embody anydeeper truths underlying the observed phenomena. Some anti-realists have evenwanted to restrict science to things that can be observed. For that reason, manyin the nineteenth century rejected the idea of atoms on the grounds that wewould never see one. George Berkeley (1685–1753) even went as far as to say thatnothing exists except the mind and its ideas. When a friend remarked to Englishauthor and lexicographer Dr. Samuel Johnson (1709–1784) that Berkeley’s claimcould not possibly be refuted, Johnson is said to have responded by walking overto a large stone, kicking it, and proclaiming, “I refute it thus.” Of course thepain Dr. Johnson experienced in his foot was also an idea in his mind, so hewasn’t really refuting Berkeley’s ideas. But his act did illustrate the view ofphilosopher David Hume (1711–1776), who wrote that although we have no rationalgrounds for believing in an objective reality, we also have no choice but to actas if it is true.Model-dependent realism short-circuits all this argument and discussion betweenthe realist and anti-realist schools of thought.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_031_r1.jpg]According to model-dependent realism, it is pointless to ask whether a model isreal, only whether it agrees with observation. If there are two models that bothagree with observation, like the goldfish’s picture and ours, then one cannotsay that one is more real than another. One can use whichever model is moreconvenient in the situation under consideration. For example, if one were insidethe bowl, the goldfish’s picture would be useful, but for those outside, itwould be very awkward to describe events from a distant galaxy in the frame of abowl on earth, especially because the bowl would be moving as the earth orbitsthe sun and spins on its axis.We make models in science, but we also make them in everyday life.Model-dependent realism applies not only to scientific models but also to theconscious and subconscious mental models we all create in order to interpret andunderstand the everyday world. There is no way to remove the observer—us—fromour perception of the world, which is created through our sensory processing andthrough the way we think and reason. Our perception—and hence the observationsupon which our theories are based—is not direct, but rather is shaped by a kindof lens, the interpretive structure of our human brains.Model-dependent realism corresponds to the way we perceive objects. In vision,one’s brain receives a series of signals down the optic nerve. Those signals donot constitute the sort of image you would accept on your television. There is ablind spot where the optic nerve attaches to the retina, and the only part ofyour field of vision with good resolution is a narrow area of about 1 degree ofvisual angle around the retina’s center, an area the width of your thumb whenheld at arm’s length. And so the raw data sent to the brain are like a badlypixilated picture with a hole in it. Fortunately, the human brain processes thatdata, combining the input from both eyes, filling in gaps on the assumption thatthe visual properties of neighboring locations are similar and interpolating.Moreover, it reads a two-dimensional array of data from the retina and createsfrom it the impression of three-dimensional space. The brain, in other words,builds a mental picture or model.The brain is so good at model building that if people are fitted with glassesthat turn the images in their eyes upside down, their brains, after a time,change the model so that they again see things the right way up. If the glassesare then removed, they see the world upside down for a while, then again adapt.This shows that what one means when one says “I see a chair” is merely that onehas used the light scattered by the chair to build a mental image or model ofthe chair. If the model is upside down, with luck one’s brain will correct itbefore one tries to sit on the chair.Another problem that model-dependent realism solves, or at least avoids, is themeaning of existence. How do I know that a table still exists if I go out of theroom and can’t see it? What does it mean to say that things we can’t see, suchas electrons or quarks—the particles that are said to make up the proton andneutron—exist? One could have a model in which the table disappears when I leavethe room and reappears in the same position when I come back, but that would beawkward, and what if something happened when I was out, like the ceiling fallingin? How, under the table-disappears-when-I-leave-the-room model, could I accountfor the fact that the next time I enter, the table reappears broken, under thedebris of the ceiling? The model in which the table stays put is much simplerand agrees with observation. That is all one can ask.In the case of subatomic particles that we can’t see, electrons are a usefulmodel that explains observations like tracks in a cloud chamber and the spots oflight on a television tube, as well as many other phenomena. It is said that theelectron was discovered in 1897 by British physicist J. J. Thomson at theCavendish Laboratory at Cambridge University. He was experimenting with currentsof electricity inside empty glass tubes, a phenomenon known as cathode rays. Hisexperiments led him to the bold conclusion that the mysterious rays werecomposed of minuscule “corpuscles” that were material constituents of atoms,which were then thought to be the indivisible fundamental unit of matter.Thomson did not “see” an electron, nor was his speculation directly orunambiguously demonstrated by his experiments. But the model has proved crucialin applications from fundamental science to engineering, and today allphysicists believe in electrons, even though you cannot see them.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_032_r1.jpg]Quarks, which we also cannot see, are a model to explain the properties of theprotons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom. Though protons and neutrons aresaid to be made of quarks, we will never observe a quark because the bindingforce between quarks increases with separation, and hence isolated, free quarkscannot exist in nature. Instead, they always occur in groups of three (protonsand neutrons), or in pairings of a quark and an anti-quark (pi mesons), andbehave as if they were joined by rubber bands.The question of whether it makes sense to say quarks really exist if you cannever isolate one was a controversial issue in the years after the quark modelwas first proposed. The idea that certain particles were made of differentcombinations of a few sub-subnuclear particles provided an organizing principlethat yielded a simple and attractive explanation for their properties. Butalthough physicists were accustomed to accepting particles that were onlyinferred to exist from statistical blips in data pertaining to the scattering ofother particles, the idea of assigning reality to a particle that might be, inprinciple, unobservable was too much for many physicists. Over the years,however, as the quark model led to more and more correct predictions, thatopposition faded. It is certainly possible that some alien beings with seventeenarms, infrared eyes, and a habit of blowing clotted cream out their ears wouldmake the same experimental observations that we do, but describe them withoutquarks. Nevertheless, according to model-dependent realism, quarks exist in amodel that agrees with our observations of how subnuclear particles behave.Model-dependent realism can provide a framework to discuss questions such as: Ifthe world was created a finite time ago, what happened before that? An earlyChristian philosopher, St. Augustine (354–430), said that the answer was notthat God was preparing hell for people who ask such questions, but that time wasa property of the world that God created and that time did not exist before thecreation, which he believed had occurred not that long ago. That is one possiblemodel, which is favored by those who maintain that the account given in Genesisis literally true even though the world contains fossil and other evidence thatmakes it look much older. (Were they put there to fool us?) One can also have adifferent model, in which time continues back 13.7 billion years to the bigbang. The model that explains the most about our present observations, includingthe historical and geological evidence, is the best representation we have ofthe past. The second model can explain the fossil and radioactive records andthe fact that we receive light from galaxies millions of light-years from us,and so this model—the big bang theory—is more useful than the first. Still,neither model can be said to be more real than the other.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_033_r1.jpg]Some people support a model in which time goes back even further than the bigbang. It is not yet clear whether a model in which time continued back beyondthe big bang would be better at explaining present observations because it seemsthe laws of the evolution of the universe may break down at the big bang. Ifthey do, it would make no sense to create a model that encompasses time beforethe big bang, because what existed then would have no observable consequencesfor the present, and so we might as well stick with the idea that the big bangwas the creation of the world.A model is a good model if it: 1. Is elegant 2. Contains few arbitrary or adjustable elements 3. Agrees with and explains all existing observations 4. Makes detailed predictions about future observations that can disprove or falsify the model if they are not borne out. For example, Aristotle’s theory that the world was made of four elements, earth,air, fire, and water, and that objects acted to fulfill their purpose waselegant and didn’t contain adjustable elements. But in many cases it didn’t makedefinite predictions, and when it did, the predictions weren’t always inagreement with observation. One of these predictions was that heavier objectsshould fall faster because their purpose is to fall. Nobody seemed to havethought that it was important to test this until Galileo. There is a story thathe tested it by dropping weights from the Leaning Tower of Pisa. This isprobably apocryphal, but we do know he rolled different weights down an inclinedplane and observed that they all gathered speed at the same rate, contrary toAristotle’s prediction.The above criteria are obviously subjective. Elegance, for example, is notsomething easily measured, but it is highly prized among scientists because lawsof nature are meant to economically compress a number of particular cases intoone simple formula. Elegance refers to the form of a theory, but it is closelyrelated to a lack of adjustable elements, since a theory jammed with fudgefactors is not very elegant. To paraphrase Einstein, a theory should be assimple as possible, but not simpler. Ptolemy added epicycles to the circularorbits of the heavenly bodies in order that his model might accurately describetheir motion. The model could have been made more accurate by adding epicyclesto the epicycles, or even epicycles to those. Though added complexity could makethe model more accurate, scientists view a model that is contorted to match aspecific set of observations as unsatisfying, more of a catalog of data than atheory likely to embody any useful principle.We’ll see in Chapter 5 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c005_r1.htm] that many peopleview the “standard model,” which describes the interactions of the elementaryparticles of nature, as inelegant. That model is far more successful thanPtolemy’s epicycles. It predicted the existence of several new particles beforethey were observed, and described the outcome of numerous experiments overseveral decades to great precision. But it contains dozens of adjustableparameters whose values must be fixed to match observations, rather than beingdetermined by the theory itself.As for the fourth point, scientists are always impressed when new and stunningpredictions prove correct. On the other hand, when a model is found lacking, acommon reaction is to say the experiment was wrong. If that doesn’t prove to bethe case, people still often don’t abandon the model but instead attempt to saveit through modifications. Although physicists are indeed tenacious in theirattempts to rescue theories they admire, the tendency to modify a theory fadesto the degree that the alterations become artificial or cumbersome, andtherefore “inelegant.”If the modifications needed to accommodate new observations become too baroque,it signals the need for a new model. One example of an old model that gave wayunder the weight of new observations was the idea of a static universe. In the1920s, most physicists believed that the universe was static, or unchanging insize. Then, in 1929, Edwin Hubble published his observations showing that theuniverse is expanding. But Hubble did not directly observe the universeexpanding. He observed the light emitted by galaxies. That light carries acharacteristic signature, or spectrum, based on each galaxy’s composition, whichchanges by a known amount if the galaxy is moving relative to us. Therefore, byanalyzing the spectra of distant galaxies, Hubble was able to determine theirvelocities. He had expected to find as many galaxies moving away from us asmoving toward us. Instead he found that nearly all galaxies were moving awayfrom us, and the farther away they were, the faster they were moving. Hubbleconcluded that the universe is expanding, but others, trying to hold on to theearlier model, attempted to explain his observations within the context of thestatic universe. For example, Caltech physicist Fritz Zwicky suggested that forsome yet unknown reason light might slowly lose energy as it travels greatdistances. This decrease in energy would correspond to a change in the light’sspectrum, which Zwicky suggested could mimic Hubble’s observations. For decadesafter Hubble, many scientists continued to hold on to the steady-state theory.But the most natural model was Hubble’s, that of an expanding universe, and ithas come to be the accepted one.In our quest to find the laws that govern the universe we have formulated anumber of theories or models, such as the four-element theory, the Ptolemaicmodel, the phlogiston theory, the big bang theory, and so on. With each theoryor model, our concepts of reality and of the fundamental constituents of theuniverse have changed. For example, consider the theory of light. Newton thoughtthat light was made up of little particles or corpuscles. This would explain whylight travels in straight lines, and Newton also used it to explain why light isbent or refracted when it passes from one medium to another, such as from air toglass or air to water.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_034_r1.jpg]The corpuscle theory could not, however, be used to explain a phenomenon thatNewton himself observed, which is known as Newton’s rings. Place a lens on aflat reflecting plate and illuminate it with light of a single color, such as asodium light. Looking down from above, one will see a series of light and darkrings centered on where the lens touches the surface. This would be difficult toexplain with the particle theory of light, but it can be accounted for in thewave theory.According to the wave theory of light, the light and dark rings are caused by aphenomenon called interference. A wave, such as a water wave, consists of aseries of crests and troughs. When waves collide, if those crests and troughshappen to correspond, they reinforce each other, yielding a larger wave. That iscalled constructive interference. In that case the waves are said to be “inphase.” At the other extreme, when the waves meet, the crests of one wave mightcoincide with the troughs of the other. In that case the waves cancel each otherand are said to be “out of phase.” That situation is called destructiveinterference.In Newton’s rings the bright rings are located at distances from the centerwhere the separation between the lens and the reflecting plate is such that thewave reflected from the lens differs from the wave reflected from the plate byan integral (1, 2, 3,…) number of wavelengths, creating constructiveinterference. (A wavelength is the distance between one crest or trough of awave and the next.) The dark rings, on the other hand, are located at distancesfrom the center where the separation between the two reflected waves is ahalf-integral (½, 1½, 2½,…) number of wavelengths, causing destructiveinterference—the wave reflected from the lens cancels the wave reflected fromthe plate.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_035_r1.jpg]In the nineteenth century, this was taken as confirming the wave theory of lightand showing that the particle theory was wrong. However, early in the twentiethcentury Einstein showed that the photoelectric effect (now used in televisionand digital cameras) could be explained by a particle or quantum of lightstriking an atom and knocking out an electron. Thus light behaves as bothparticle and wave.The concept of waves probably entered human thought because people watched theocean, or a puddle after a pebble fell into it. In fact, if you have everdropped two pebbles into a puddle, you have probably seen interference at work,as in the picture above. Other liquids were observed to behave in a similarfashion, except perhaps wine if you’ve had too much. The idea of particles wasfamiliar from rocks, pebbles, and sand. But this wave/particle duality—the ideathat an object could be described as either a particle or a wave—is as foreignto everyday experience as is the idea that you can drink a chunk of sandstone.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_036_r1.jpg]Dualities like this—situations in which two very different theories accuratelydescribe the same phenomenon—are consistent with model-dependent realism. Eachtheory can describe and explain certain properties, and neither theory can besaid to be better or more real than the other. Regarding the laws that governthe universe, what we can say is this: There seems to be no single mathematicalmodel or theory that can describe every aspect of the universe. Instead, asmentioned in the opening chapter, there seems to be the network of theoriescalled M-theory. Each theory in the M-theory network is good at describingphenomena within a certain range. Wherever their ranges overlap, the varioustheories in the network agree, so they can all be said to be parts of the sametheory. But no single theory within the network can describe every aspect of theuniverse—all the forces of nature, the particles that feel those forces, and theframework of space and time in which it all plays out. Though this situationdoes not fulfill the traditional physicists’ dream of a single unified theory,it is acceptable within the framework of model-dependent realism.We will discuss duality and M-theory further in Chapter 5[Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c005_r1.htm], but before that we turn to a fundamentalprinciple upon which our modern view of nature is based: quantum theory, and inparticular, the approach to quantum theory called alternative histories. In thatview, the universe does not have just a single existence or history, but ratherevery possible version of the universe exists simultaneously in what is called aquantum superposition. That may sound as outrageous as the theory in which thetable disappears whenever we leave the room, but in this case the theory haspassed every experimental test to which it has ever been subjected.

Thosemolecules, each made of sixty carbon atoms, are sometimes called buckyballsbecause the architect Buckminster Fuller built buildings of that shape. Fuller’sgeodesic domes were probably the largest soccer-ball-shaped objects inexistence. The buckyballs were the smallest. The barrier toward which thescientists took their aim had, in effect, two slits through which the buckyballscould pass. Beyond the wall, the physicists situated the equivalent of a screento detect and count the emergent molecules.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_040_r1.jpg]If we were to set up an analogous experiment with real soccer balls, we wouldneed a player with somewhat shaky aim but with the ability to launch the ballsconsistently at a speed of our choosing. We would position this player before awall in which there are two gaps. On the far side of the wall, and parallel toit, we would place a very long net. Most of the player’s shots would hit thewall and bounce back, but some would go through one gap or the other, and intothe net. If the gaps were only slightly larger than the balls, two highlycollimated streams would emerge on the other side. If the gaps were a bit widerthan that, each stream would fan out a little, as shown in the figure below.Notice that if we closed off one of the gaps, the corresponding stream of ballswould no longer get through, but this would have no effect on the other stream.If we reopened the second gap, that would only increase the number of balls thatland at any given point on the other side, for we would then get all the ballsthat passed through the gap that had remained open, plus other balls coming fromthe newly opened gap. What we observe with both gaps open, in other words, isthe sum of what we observe with each gap in the wall separately opened. That isthe reality we are accustomed to in everyday life. But that’s not what theAustrian researchers found when they fired their molecules.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_041_r1.jpg]In the Austrian experiment, opening the second gap did indeed increase thenumber of molecules arriving at some points on the screen—but it decreased thenumber at others, as in the figure below. In fact, there were spots where nobuckyballs landed when both slits were open but where balls did land when onlyone or the other gap was open. That seems very odd. How can opening a second gapcause fewer molecules to arrive at certain points?[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_042_r1.jpg]We can get a clue to the answer by examining the details. In the experiment,many of the molecular soccer balls landed at a spot centered halfway betweenwhere you would expect them to land if the balls went through either one gap orthe other. A little farther out from that central position very few moleculesarrived, but a bit farther away from the center than that, molecules were againobserved to arrive. This pattern is not the sum of the patterns formed when eachgap is opened separately, but you may recognize it from Chapter 3[Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c003_r1.htm] as the pattern characteristic ofinterfering waves. The areas where no molecules arrive correspond to regions inwhich waves emitted from the two gaps arrive out of phase, and createdestructive interference; the areas where many molecules arrive correspond toregions where the waves arrive in phase, and create constructive interference.In the first two thousand or so years of scientific thought, ordinary experienceand intuition were the basis for theoretical explanation. As we improved ourtechnology and expanded the range of phenomena that we could observe, we beganto find nature behaving in ways that were less and less in line with oureveryday experience and hence with our intuition, as evidenced by the experimentwith buckyballs. That experiment is typical of the type of phenomena that cannotbe encompassed by classical science but are described by what is called quantumphysics. In fact, Richard Feynman wrote that the double-slit experiment like theone we described above “contains all the mystery of quantum mechanics.”The principles of quantum physics were developed in the first few decades of thetwentieth century after Newtonian theory was found to be inadequate for thedescription of nature on the atomic—or subatomic—level. The fundamental theoriesof physics describe the forces of nature and how objects react to them.Classical theories such as Newton’s are built upon a framework reflectingeveryday experience, in which material objects have an individual existence, canbe located at definite locations, follow definite paths, and so on. Quantumphysics provides a framework for understanding how nature operates on atomic andsubatomic scales, but as we’ll see in more detail later, it dictates acompletely different conceptual schema, one in which an object’s position, path,and even its past and future are not precisely determined. Quantum theories offorces such as gravity or the electromagnetic force are built within thatframework.Can theories built upon a framework so foreign to everyday experience alsoexplain the events of ordinary experience that were modeled so accurately byclassical physics? They can, for we and our surroundings are compositestructures, made of an unimaginably large number of atoms, more atoms than thereare stars in the observable universe. And though the component atoms obey theprinciples of quantum physics, one can show that the large assemblages that formsoccer balls, turnips, and jumbo jets—and us—will indeed manage to avoiddiffracting through slits. So though the components of everyday objects obeyquantum physics, Newton’s laws form an effective theory that describes veryaccurately how the composite structures that form our everyday world behave.That might sound strange, but there are many instances in science in which alarge assemblage appears to behave in a manner that is different from thebehavior of its individual components. The responses of a single neuron hardlyportend those of the human brain, nor does knowing about a water molecule tellyou much about the behavior of a lake. In the case of quantum physics,physicists are still working to figure out the details of how Newton’s lawsemerge from the quantum domain. What we do know is that the components of allobjects obey the laws of quantum physics, and the Newtonian laws are a goodapproximation for describing the way macroscopic objects made of those quantumcomponents behave.The predictions of Newtonian theory therefore match the view of reality we alldevelop as we experience the world around us. But individual atoms and moleculesoperate in a manner profoundly different from that of our everyday experience.Quantum physics is a new model of reality that gives us a picture of theuniverse. It is a picture in which many concepts fundamental to our intuitiveunderstanding of reality no longer have meaning.The double-slit experiment was first carried out in 1927 by Clinton Davisson andLester Germer, experimental physicists at Bell Labs who were studying how a beamof electrons—objects much simpler than buckyballs—interacts with a crystal madeof nickel. The fact that matter particles such as electrons behave like waterwaves was the type of startling experiment that inspired quantum physics. Sincethis behavior is not observed on a macroscopic scale, scientists have longwondered just how large and complex something could be and still exhibit suchwavelike properties. It would cause quite a stir if the effect could bedemonstrated using people or a hippopotamus, but as we’ve said, in general, thelarger the object the less apparent and robust are the quantum effects. So it isunlikely that any zoo animals will be passing wavelike through the bars of theircages. Still, experimental physicists have observed the wave phenomenon withparticles of ever-increasing size. Scientists hope to replicate the buckyballexperiment someday using a virus, which is not only far bigger but alsoconsidered by some to be a living thing.There are only a few aspects of quantum physics needed to understand thearguments we will make in later chapters. One of the key features iswave/particle duality. That matter particles behave like a wave surprisedeveryone. That light behaves like a wave no longer surprises anyone. Thewavelike behavior of light seems natural to us and has been considered anaccepted fact for almost two centuries. If you shine a beam of light on the twoslits in the above experiment, two waves will emerge and meet on the screen. Atsome points their crests or troughs will coincide and form a bright spot; atothers the crests of one beam will meet the troughs of the other, cancelingthem, and leaving a dark area. The English physicist Thomas Young performed thisexperiment in the early nineteenth century, convincing people that light was awave and not, as Newton had believed, composed of particles.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_043_r1.jpg]Though one might conclude that Newton was wrong to say that light was not awave, he was right when he said that light can act as if it is composed ofparticles. Today we call them photons. Just as we are composed of a large numberof atoms, the light we see in everyday life is composite in the sense that it ismade of a great many photons—even a 1-watt night-light emits a billion billioneach second. Single photons are not usually evident, but in the laboratory wecan produce a beam of light so faint that it consists of a stream of singlephotons, which we can detect as individuals just as we can detect individualelectrons or buckyballs. And we can repeat Young’s experiment employing a beamsufficiently sparse that the photons reach the barrier one at a time, with a fewseconds between each arrival. If we do that, and then add up all the individualimpacts recorded by the screen on the far side of the barrier, we find thattogether they build up the same interference pattern that would be built up ifwe performed the Davisson-Germer experiment but fired the electrons (orbuckyballs) at the screen one at a time. To physicists, that was a startlingrevelation: If individual particles interfere with themselves, then the wavenature of light is the property not just of a beam or of a large collection ofphotons but of the individual particles.Another of the main tenets of quantum physics is the uncertainty principle,formulated by Werner Heisenberg in 1926. The uncertainty principle tells us thatthere are limits to our ability to simultaneously measure certain data, such asthe position and velocity of a particle. According to the uncertainty principle,for example, if you multiply the uncertainty in the position of a particle bythe uncertainty in its momentum (its mass times its velocity) the result cannever be smaller than a certain fixed quantity, called Planck’s constant. That’sa tongue-twister, but its gist can be stated simply: The more precisely youmeasure speed, the less precisely you can measure position, and vice versa. Forinstance, if you halve the uncertainty in position, you have to double theuncertainty in velocity. It is also important to note that, compared witheveryday units of measurement such as meters, kilograms, and seconds, Planck’sconstant is very small. In fact, if reported in those units, it has the value ofabout 6/10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. As a result, if youpinpoint a macroscopic object such as a soccer ball, with a mass of one-third ofa kilogram, to within 1 millimeter in any direction, we can still measure itsvelocity with a precision far greater than even a billionth of a billionth of abillionth of a kilometer per hour. That’s because, measured in these units, thesoccer ball has a mass of 1/3, and the uncertainty in position is 1/1,000.Neither is enough to account for all those zeroes in Planck’s constant, and sothat role falls to the uncertainty in velocity. But in the same units anelectron has a mass of .000000000000000000000000000001, so for electrons thesituation is quite different. If we measure the position of an electron to aprecision corresponding to roughly the size of an atom, the uncertaintyprinciple dictates that we cannot know the electron’s speed more precisely thanabout plus or minus 1,000 kilometers per second, which is not very precise atall.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_044_r1.jpg]According to quantum physics, no matter how much information we obtain or howpowerful our computing abilities, the outcomes of physical processes cannot bepredicted with certainty because they are not determined with certainty.Instead, given the initial state of a system, nature determines its future statethrough a process that is fundamentally uncertain. In other words, nature doesnot dictate the outcome of any process or experiment, even in the simplest ofsituations. Rather, it allows a number of different eventualities, each with acertain likelihood of being realized. It is, to paraphrase Einstein, as if Godthrows the dice before deciding the result of every physical process. That ideabothered Einstein, and so even though he was one of the fathers of quantumphysics, he later became critical of it.Quantum physics might seem to undermine the idea that nature is governed bylaws, but that is not the case. Instead it leads us to accept a new form ofdeterminism: Given the state of a system at some time, the laws of naturedetermine the probabilities of various futures and pasts rather than determiningthe future and past with certainty. Though that is distasteful to some,scientists must accept theories that agree with experiment, not their ownpreconceived notions.What science does demand of a theory is that it be testable. If theprobabilistic nature of the predictions of quantum physics meant it wasimpossible to confirm those predictions, then quantum theories would not qualifyas valid theories. But despite the probabilistic nature of their predictions, wecan still test quantum theories. For instance, we can repeat an experiment manytimes and confirm that the frequency of various outcomes conforms to theprobabilities predicted. Consider the buckyball experiment. Quantum physicstells us that nothing is ever located at a definite point because if it were,the uncertainty in momentum would have to be infinite. In fact, according toquantum physics, each particle has some probability of being found anywhere inthe universe. So even if the chances of finding a given electron within thedouble-slit apparatus are very high, there will always be some chance that itcould be found instead on the far side of the star Alpha Centauri, or in theshepherd’s pie at your office cafeteria. As a result, if you kick a quantumbuckyball and let it fly, no amount of skill or knowledge will allow you to sayin advance exactly where it will land. But if you repeat that experiment manytimes, the data you obtain will reflect the probability of finding the ball atvarious locations, and experimenters have confirmed that the results of suchexperiments agree with the theory’s predictions.It is important to realize that probabilities in quantum physics are not likeprobabilities in Newtonian physics, or in everyday life. We can understand thisby comparing the patterns built up by the steady stream of buckyballs fired at ascreen to the pattern of holes built up by players aiming for the bull’s-eye ona dartboard. Unless the players have consumed too much beer, the chances of adart landing near the center are greatest, and diminish as you go farther out.As with the buckyballs, any given dart can land anywhere, and over time apattern of holes that reflects the underlying probabilities will emerge. Ineveryday life we might reflect that situation by saying that a dart has acertain probability of landing in various spots; but if we say that, unlike thecase of the buckyballs, it is only because our knowledge of the conditions ofits launch is incomplete. We could improve our description if we knew exactlythe manner in which the player released the dart, its angle, spin, velocity, andso forth. In principle, then, we could predict where the dart will land with aprecision as great as we desire. Our use of probabilistic terms to describe theoutcome of events in everyday life is therefore a reflection not of theintrinsic nature of the process but only of our ignorance of certain aspects ofit.Probabilities in quantum theories are different. They reflect a fundamentalrandomness in nature. The quantum model of nature encompasses principles thatcontradict not only our everyday experience but our intuitive concept ofreality. Those who find those principles weird or difficult to believe are ingood company, the company of great physicists such as Einstein and even Feynman,whose description of quantum theory we will soon present. In fact, Feynman oncewrote, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics.” Butquantum physics agrees with observation. It has never failed a test, and it hasbeen tested more than any other theory in science.In the 1940s Richard Feynman had a startling insight regarding the differencebetween the quantum and Newtonian worlds. Feynman was intrigued by the questionof how the interference pattern in the double-slit experiment arises. Recallthat the pattern we find when we fire molecules with both slits open is not thesum of the patterns we find when we run the experiment twice, once with just oneslit open, and once with only the other open. Instead, when both slits are openwe find a series of light and dark bands, the latter being regions in which noparticles land. That means that particles that would have landed in the area ofthe dark band if, say, only slit one was open, do not land there when slit twois also open. It seems as if, somewhere on their journey from source to screen,the particles acquire information about both slits. That kind of behavior isdrastically different from the way things seem to behave in everyday life, inwhich a ball would follow a path through one of the slits and be unaffected bythe situation at the other.According to Newtonian physics—and to the way the experiment would work if wedid it with soccer balls instead of molecules—each particle follows a singlewell-defined route from its source to the screen. There is no room in thispicture for a detour in which the particle visits the neighborhood of each slitalong the way. According to the quantum model, however, the particle is said tohave no definite position during the time it is between the starting point andthe endpoint. Feynman realized one does not have to interpret that to mean thatparticles take no path as they travel between source and screen. It could meaninstead that particles take every possible path connecting those points. This,Feynman asserted, is what makes quantum physics different from Newtonianphysics. The situation at both slits matters because, rather than following asingle definite path, particles take every path, and they take them allsimultaneously! That sounds like science fiction, but it isn’t. Feynmanformulated a mathematical expression—the Feynman sum over histories—thatreflects this idea and reproduces all the laws of quantum physics. In Feynman’stheory the mathematics and physical picture are different from that of theoriginal formulation of quantum physics, but the predictions are the same.In the double-slit experiment Feynman’s ideas mean the particles take paths thatgo through only one slit or only the other; paths that thread through the firstslit, back out through the second slit, and then through the first again; pathsthat visit the restaurant that serves that great curried shrimp, and then circleJupiter a few times before heading home; even paths that go across the universeand back. This, in Feynman’s view, explains how the particle acquires theinformation about which slits are open—if a slit is open, the particle takespaths through it. When both slits are open, the paths in which the particletravels through one slit can interfere with the paths in which it travelsthrough the other, causing the interference. It might sound nutty, but for thepurposes of most fundamental physics done today—and for the purposes of thisbook—Feynman’s formulation has proved more useful than the original one.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_045_r1.jpg]Feynman’s view of quantum reality is crucial in understanding the theories wewill soon present, so it is worth taking some time to get a feeling for how itworks. Imagine a simple process in which a particle begins at some location Aand moves freely. In the Newtonian model that particle will follow a straightline. After a certain precise time passes, we will find the particle at someprecise location B along that line. In Feynman’s model a quantum particlesamples every path connecting A and B, collecting a number called a phase foreach path. That phase represents the position in the cycle of a wave, that is,whether the wave is at a crest or trough or some precise position in between.Feynman’s mathematical prescription for calculating that phase showed that whenyou add together the waves from all the paths you get the “probabilityamplitude” that the particle, starting at A, will reach B. The square of thatprobability amplitude then gives the correct probability that the particle willreach B.The phase that each individual path contributes to the Feynman sum (and hence tothe probability of going from A to B) can be visualized as an arrow that is offixed length but can point in any direction. To add two phases, you place thearrow representing one phase at the end of the arrow representing the other, toget a new arrow representing the sum. To add more phases, you simply continuethe process. Note that when the phases line up, the arrow representing the totalcan be quite long. But if they point in different directions, they tend tocancel when you add them, leaving you with not much of an arrow at all. The ideais illustrated in the figures below.To carry out Feynman’s prescription for calculating the probability amplitudethat a particle beginning at a location A will end up at a location B, you addthe phases, or arrows, associated with every path connecting A and B. There arean infinite number of paths, which makes the mathematics a bit complicated, butit works. Some of the paths are pictured below.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_046_r1.jpg]Feynman’s theory gives an especially clear picture of how a Newtonian worldpicture can arise from quantum physics, which seems very different. According toFeynman’s theory, the phases associated with each path depend upon Planck’sconstant. The theory dictates that because Planck’s constant is so small, whenyou add the contribution from paths that are close to each other the phasesnormally vary wildly, and so, as in the figure above, they tend to add to zero.But the theory also shows that there are certain paths for which the phases havea tendency to line up, and so those paths are favored; that is, they make alarger contribution to the observed behavior of the particle. It turns out thatfor large objects, paths very similar to the path predicted by Newton’s willhave similar phases and add up to give by far the largest contribution to thesum, and so the only destination that has a probability effectively greater thanzero is the destination predicted by Newtonian theory, and that destination hasa probability that is very nearly one. Hence large objects move just as Newton’stheory predicts they will.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_047_r1.jpg]So far we have discussed Feynman’s ideas in the context of the double-slitexperiment. In that experiment particles are fired toward a wall with slits, andwe measure the location, on a screen placed beyond the wall, at which theparticles end up. More generally, instead of just a single particle Feynman’stheory allows us to predict the probable outcomes of a “system,” which could bea particle, a set of particles, or even the entire universe. Between the initialstate of the system and our later measurement of its properties, thoseproperties evolve in some way, which physicists call the system’s history. Inthe double-slit experiment, for example, the history of the particle is simplyits path. Just as for the double-slit experiment the chance of observing theparticle to land at any given point depends upon all the paths that could havegotten it there, Feynman showed that, for a general system, the probability ofany observation is constructed from all the possible histories that could haveled to that observation. Because of that his method is called the “sum overhistories” or “alternative histories” formulation of quantum physics.Now that we have a feeling for Feynman’s approach to quantum physics, it is timeto examine another key quantum principle that we will use later—the principlethat observing a system must alter its course. Can’t we, as we do when oursupervisor has a spot of mustard on her chin, discreetly watch but notinterfere? No. According to quantum physics, you cannot “just” observesomething. That is, quantum physics recognizes that to make an observation, youmust interact with the object you are observing. For instance, to see an objectin the traditional sense, we shine a light on it. Shining a light on a pumpkinwill of course have little effect on it. But shining even a dim light on a tinyquantum particle—that is, shooting photons at it—does have an appreciableeffect, and experiments show that it changes the results of an experiment injust the way that quantum physics describes.Suppose that, as before, we send a stream of particles toward the barrier in thedouble-slit experiment and collect data on the first million particles to getthrough. When we plot the number of particles landing at various detectionpoints the data will form the interference pattern pictured, and when we add thephases associated with all the possible paths from a particle’s starting point Ato its detection point B, we will find that the probability we calculate oflanding at various points agrees with that data.Now suppose we repeat the experiment, this time shining lights on the slits sothat we know an intermediate point, C, through which the particle passed. (C isthe position of either one of the slits or the other.) This is called“which-path” information because it tells us whether each particle went from Ato slit 1 to B, or from A to slit 2 to B. Since we now know through which sliteach particle passed, the paths in our sum for that particle will now includeonly paths that travel through slit 1, or only paths that travel through slit 2.It will never include both the paths that go through slit 1 and the paths thatpass through slit 2. Because Feynman explained the interference pattern bysaying that paths that go through one slit interfere with paths that go throughthe other, if you turn on a light to determine which slit the particles passthrough, thereby eliminating the other option, you will make the interferencepattern disappear. And indeed, when the experiment is performed, turning on alight changes the results from the interference pattern, to a pattern like that!Moreover, we can vary the experiment by employing very faint light so that notall of the particles interact with the light. In that case we are able to obtainwhich-path information for only some subset of the particles. If we then dividethe data on particle arrivals according to whether or not we obtained which-pathinformation, we find that data pertaining to the subset for which we have nowhich-path information will form an interference pattern, and the subset of datapertaining to the particles for which we do have which-path information will notshow interference.This idea has important implications for our concept of “the past.” In Newtoniantheory, the past is assumed to exist as a definite series of events. If you seethat vase you bought in Italy last year lying smashed on the floor and yourtoddler standing over it looking sheepish, you can trace backward the eventsthat led to the mishap: the little fingers letting go, the vase falling andexploding into a thousand pieces as it hits. In fact, given complete data aboutthe present, Newton’s laws allow one to calculate a complete picture of thepast. This is consistent with our intuitive understanding that, whether painfulor joyful, the world has a definite past. There may have been no one watching,but the past exists as surely as if you had taken a series of snapshots of it.But a quantum buckyball cannot be said to have taken a definite path from sourceto screen. We might pin down a buckyball’s location by observing it, but inbetween our observations, it takes all paths. Quantum physics tells us that nomatter how thorough our observation of the present, the (unobserved) past, likethe future, is indefinite and exists only as a spectrum of possibilities. Theuniverse, according to quantum physics, has no single past, or history.The fact that the past takes no definite form means that observations you makeon a system in the present affect its past. That is underlined ratherdramatically by a type of experiment thought up by physicist John Wheeler,called a delayed-choice experiment. Schematically, a delayed-choice experimentis like the double-slit experiment we just described, in which you have theoption of observing the path that the particle takes, except in thedelayed-choice experiment you postpone your decision about whether or not toobserve the path until just before the particle hits the detection screen.Delayed-choice experiments result in data identical to those we get when wechoose to observe (or not observe) the which-path information by watching theslits themselves. But in this case the path each particle takes—that is, itspast—is determined long after it passed through the slits and presumably had to“decide” whether to travel through just one slit, which does not produceinterference, or both slits, which does.Wheeler even considered a cosmic version of the experiment, in which theparticles involved are photons emitted by powerful quasars billions oflight-years away. Such light could be split into two paths and refocused towardearth by the gravitational lensing of an intervening galaxy. Though theexperiment is beyond the reach of current technology, if we could collect enoughphotons from this light, they ought to form an interference pattern. Yet if weplace a device to measure which-path information shortly before detection, thatpattern should disappear. The choice whether to take one or both paths in thiscase would have been made billions of years ago, before the earth or perhapseven our sun was formed, and yet with our observation in the laboratory we willbe affecting that choice.In this chapter we have illustrated quantum physics employing the double-slitexperiment. In what follows we will apply Feynman’s formulation of quantummechanics to the universe as a whole. We will see that, like a particle, theuniverse doesn’t have just a single history, but every possible history, eachwith its own probability; and our observations of its current state affect itspast and determine the different histories of the universe, just as theobservations of the particles in the double-slit experiment affect theparticles’ past. That analysis will show how the laws of nature in our universearose from the big bang. But before we examine how the laws arose, we’ll talk alittle bit about what those laws are, and some of the mysteries that theyprovoke.

The first force to be described inmathematical language was gravity. Newton’s law of gravity, published in 1687,said that every object in the universe attracts every other object with a forceproportional to its mass. It made a great impression on the intellectual life ofits era because it showed for the first time that at least one aspect of theuniverse could be accurately modeled, and it established the mathematicalmachinery to do so. The idea that there are laws of nature brings up issuessimilar to that for which Galileo had been convicted of heresy about fifty yearsearlier. For instance, the Bible tells the story of Joshua praying for the sunand moon to stop in their trajectories so he would have extra daylight to finishfighting the Amorites in Canaan. According to the book of Joshua, the sun stoodstill for about a day. Today we know that that would have meant that the earthstopped rotating. If the earth stopped, according to Newton’s laws anything nottied down would have remained in motion at the earth’s original speed (1,100miles per hour at the equator)—a high price to pay for a delayed sunset. None ofthis bothered Newton himself, for as we’ve said, Newton believed that God couldand did intervene in the workings of the universe.The next aspects of the universe for which a law or model was discovered werethe electric and magnetic forces. These behave like gravity, with the importantdifference that two electric charges or two magnets of the same kind repel eachother, while unlike charges or unlike magnets attract. Electric and magneticforces are far stronger than gravity, but we don’t usually notice them ineveryday life because a macroscopic body contains almost equal numbers ofpositive and negative electrical charges. This means that the electric andmagnetic forces between two macroscopic bodies nearly cancel each other out,unlike the gravitational forces, which all add up.Our current ideas about electricity and magnetism were developed over a periodof about a hundred years from the mid-eighteenth to the mid-nineteenth century,when physicists in several countries made detailed experimental studies ofelectric and magnetic forces. One of the most important discoveries was thatelectrical and magnetic forces are related: A moving electrical charge causes aforce on magnets, and a moving magnet causes a force on electrical charges. Thefirst to realize there was some connection was Danish physicist Hans ChristianØrsted. While setting up for a lecture he was to give at the university in 1820,Ørsted noticed that the electric current from the battery he was using deflecteda nearby compass needle. He soon realized that moving electricity created amagnetic force, and coined the term “electromagnetism.” A few years laterBritish scientist Michael Faraday reasoned that—expressed in modern terms—if anelectric current could cause a magnetic field, a magnetic field should be ableto produce an electric current. He demonstrated that effect in 1831. Fourteenyears later Faraday also discovered a connection between electromagnetism andlight when he showed that intense magnetism can affect the nature of polarizedlight.Faraday had little formal education. He had been born into a poor blacksmith’sfamily near London and left school at age thirteen to work as an errand boy andbookbinder in a bookshop. There, over the years, he learned science by readingthe books he was supposed to care for, and by performing simple and cheapexperiments in his spare time. Eventually he obtained work as an assistant inthe laboratory of the great chemist Sir Humphry Davy. Faraday would stay on forthe remaining forty-five years of his life and, after Davy’s death, succeed him.Faraday had trouble with mathematics and never learned much of it, so it was astruggle for him to conceive a theoretical picture of the odd electromagneticphenomena he observed in his laboratory. Nevertheless, he did.One of Faraday’s greatest intellectual innovations was the idea of force fields.These days, thanks to books and movies about bug-eyed aliens and theirstarships, most people are familiar with the term, so maybe he should get aroyalty. But in the centuries between Newton and Faraday one of the greatmysteries of physics was that its laws seemed to indicate that forces act acrossthe empty space that separates interacting objects. Faraday didn’t like that. Hebelieved that to move an object, something has to come in contact with it. Andso he imagined the space between electric charges and magnets as being filledwith invisible tubes that physically do the pushing and pulling. Faraday calledthose tubes a force field. A good way to visualize a force field is to performthe schoolroom demonstration in which a glass plate is placed over a bar magnetand iron filings spread on the glass. With a few taps to overcome friction, thefilings move as if nudged by an unseen power and arrange themselves in a patternof arcs stretching from one pole of the magnet to the other. That pattern is amap of the unseen magnetic force that permeates space. Today we believe that allforces are transmitted by fields, so it is an important concept in modernphysics—as well as science fiction.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_051_r1.jpg]For several decades our understanding of electromagnetism remained stalled,amounting to no more than the knowledge of a few empirical laws: the hint thatelectricity and magnetism were closely, if mysteriously, related; the notionthat they had some sort of connection to light; and the embryonic concept offields. At least eleven theories of electromagnetism existed, every one of themflawed. Then, over a period of years in the 1860s, Scottish physicist JamesClerk Maxwell developed Faraday’s thinking into a mathematical framework thatexplained the intimate and mysterious relation among electricity, magnetism, andlight. The result was a set of equations describing both electric and magneticforces as manifestations of the same physical entity, the electromagnetic field.Maxwell had unified electricity and magnetism into one force. Moreover, heshowed that electromagnetic fields could propagate through space as a wave. Thespeed of that wave is governed by a number that appeared in his equations, whichhe calculated from experimental data that had been measured a few years earlier.To his astonishment the speed he calculated equaled the speed of light, whichwas then known experimentally to an accuracy of 1 percent. He had discoveredthat light itself is an electromagnetic wave!Today the equations that describe electric and magnetic fields are calledMaxwell’s equations. Few people have heard of them, but they are probably themost commercially important equations we know. Not only do they govern theworking of everything from household appliances to computers, but they alsodescribe waves other than light, such as microwaves, radio waves, infraredlight, and X-rays. All of these differ from visible light in only onerespect—their wavelength. Radio waves have wavelengths of a meter or more, whilevisible light has a wavelength of a few ten-millionths of a meter, and X-rays awavelength shorter than a hundred-millionth of a meter. Our sun radiates at allwavelengths, but its radiation is most intense in the wavelengths that arevisible to us. It’s probably no accident that the wavelengths we are able to seewith the naked eye are those in which the sun radiates most strongly: It’slikely that our eyes evolved with the ability to detect electromagneticradiation in that range precisely because that is the range of radiation mostavailable to them. If we ever run into beings from other planets, they willprobably have the ability to “see” radiation at whatever wavelengths their ownsun emits most strongly, modulated by factors such as the light-blockingcharacteristics of the dust and gases in their planet’s atmosphere. So alienswho evolved in the presence of X-rays might have a nice career in airportsecurity.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_052_r1.jpg]Maxwell’s equations dictate that electromagnetic waves travel at a speed ofabout 300,000 kilometers a second, or about 670 million miles per hour. But toquote a speed means nothing unless you specify a frame of reference relative towhich the speed is measured. That’s not something you usually need to thinkabout in everyday life. When a speed limit sign reads 60 miles per hour, it isunderstood that your speed is measured relative to the road and not the blackhole at the center of the Milky Way. But even in everyday life there areoccasions in which you have to take into account reference frames. For example,if you carry a cup of tea up the aisle of a jet plane in flight, you might sayyour speed is 2 miles per hour. Someone on the ground, however, might say youwere moving at 572 miles per hour. Lest you think that one or the other of thoseobservers has a better claim to the truth, keep in mind that because the earthorbits the sun, someone watching you from the surface of that heavenly bodywould disagree with both and say you are moving at about 18 miles per second,not to mention envying your air-conditioning. In light of such disagreements,when Maxwell claimed to have discovered the “speed of light” popping out of hisequations, the natural question was, what is the speed of light in Maxwell’sequations measured relative to?There is no reason to believe that the speed parameter in Maxwell’s equations isa speed measured relative to the earth. His equations, after all, apply to theentire universe. An alternative answer that was considered for a while is thathis equations specify the speed of light relative to a previously undetectedmedium permeating all space, called the luminiferous ether, or for short, simplythe ether, which was Aristotle’s term for the substance he believed filled allof the universe outside the terrestrial sphere. This hypothetical ether would bethe medium through which electromagnetic waves propagate, just as soundpropagates through air. If the ether existed, there would be an absolutestandard of rest (that is, rest with respect to the ether) and hence an absoluteway of defining motion as well. The ether would provide a preferred frame ofreference throughout the entire universe, against which any object’s speed couldbe measured. So the ether was postulated to exist on theoretical grounds,setting some scientists off on a search for a way to study it, or at least toconfirm its existence. One of those scientists was Maxwell himself.If you race through the air toward a sound wave, the wave approaches you faster,and if you race away, it approaches you more slowly. Similarly, if there were anether, the speed of light would vary depending on your motion relative to theether. In fact, if light worked the way sound does, just as people on asupersonic jet will never hear any sound that emanates from behind the plane, sotoo would travelers racing quickly enough through the ether be able to outrun alight wave. Working from such considerations, Maxwell suggested an experiment.If there is an ether, the earth must be moving through it as it orbits the sun.And since the earth is traveling in a different direction in January than, say,in April or July, one ought to be able to observe a tiny difference in the speedof light at different times of the year—see the figure below.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_053_r1.jpg]Maxwell was talked out of publishing his idea in Proceedings of the RoyalSociety by its editor, who didn’t think the experiment would work. But in 1879,shortly before he died at age forty-eight of painful stomach cancer, Maxwellsent a letter on the subject to a friend. The letter was published posthumouslyin the journal Nature, where it was read by, among others, an American physicistnamed Albert Michelson. Inspired by Maxwell’s speculation, in 1887 Michelson andEdward Morley carried out a very sensitive experiment designed to measure thespeed at which the earth travels through the ether. Their idea was to comparethe speed of light in two different directions, at right angles. If the speed oflight were a fixed number relative to the ether, the measurements should haverevealed light speeds that differed depending on the direction of the beam. ButMichelson and Morley observed no such difference.The outcome of the Michelson and Morley experiment is clearly in conflict withthe model of electromagnetic waves traveling through an ether, and should havecaused the ether model to be abandoned. But Michelson’s purpose had been tomeasure the speed of the earth relative to the ether, not to prove or disprovethe ether hypothesis, and what he found did not lead him to conclude that theether didn’t exist. No one else drew that conclusion either. In fact, the famousphysicist Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) said in 1884 that the ether was “theonly substance we are confident of in dynamics. One thing we are sure of, andthat is the reality and substantiality of the luminiferous ether.”How can you believe in the ether despite the results of the Michelson-Morleyexperiment? As we’ve said often happens, people tried to save the model bycontrived and ad hoc additions. Some postulated that the earth dragged the etheralong with it, so we weren’t actually moving with respect to it. Dutch physicistHendrik Antoon Lorentz and Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald suggestedthat in a frame that was moving with respect to the ether, probably due to someyet-unknown mechanical effect, clocks would slow down and distances wouldshrink, so one would still measure light to have the same speed. Such efforts tosave the aether concept continued for nearly twenty years until a remarkablepaper by a young and unknown clerk in the patent office in Berne, AlbertEinstein.Einstein was twenty-six in 1905 when he published his paper “Zur Elektrodynamikbewegter Körper” (“On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies”). In it he made thesimple assumption that the laws of physics and in particular the speed of lightshould appear to be the same to all uniformly moving observers. This idea, itturns out, demands a revolution in our concept of space and time. To see why,imagine two events that take place at the same spot but at different times, in ajet aircraft. To an observer on the jet there will be zero distance betweenthose two events. But to a second observer on the ground the events will beseparated by the distance the jet has traveled in the time between the events.This shows that two observers who are moving relative to each other will notagree on the distance between two events.Now suppose the two observers observe a pulse of light traveling from the tailof the aircraft to its nose. Just as in the above example, they will not agreeon the distance the light has traveled from its emission at the plane’s tail toits reception at the nose. Since speed is distance traveled divided by the timetaken, this means that if they agree on the speed at which the pulse travels—thespeed of light—they will not agree on the time interval between the emission andthe reception.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_054_r1.jpg]What makes this strange is that, though the two observers measure differenttimes, they are watching the same physical process. Einstein didn’t attempt toconstruct an artificial explanation for this. He drew the logical, if startling,conclusion that the measurement of the time taken, like the measurement of thedistance covered, depends on the observer doing the measuring. That effect isone of the keys to the theory in Einstein’s 1905 paper, which has come to becalled special relativity.We can see how this analysis could apply to timekeeping devices if we considertwo observers looking at a clock. Special relativity holds that the clock runsfaster according to an observer who is at rest with respect to the clock. Toobservers who are not at rest with respect to the clock, the clock runs slower.If we liken a light pulse traveling from the tail to the nose of the plane tothe tick of a clock, we see that to an observer on the ground the clock runsslower because the light beam has to travel a greater distance in that frame ofreference. But the effect does not depend on the mechanism of the clock; itholds for all clocks, even our own biological ones.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_055_r1.jpg]Einstein’s work showed that, like the concept of rest, time cannot be absolute,as Newton thought. In other words, it is not possible to assign to every event atime with which every observer will agree. Instead, all observers have their ownmeasures of time, and the times measured by two observers who are movingrelative to each other will not agree. Einstein’s ideas go counter to ourintuition because their implications aren’t noticeable at the speeds we normallyencounter in everyday life. But they have been repeatedly confirmed byexperiment. For example, imagine a reference clock at rest at the center of theearth, another clock on the earth’s surface, and a third clock aboard a plane,flying either with or against the direction of the earth’s rotation. Withreference to the clock at the earth’s center, the clock aboard the plane movingeastward—in the direction of the earth’s rotation—is moving faster than theclock on the earth’s surface, and so it should run slower. Similarly, withreference to the clock at the earth’s center, the clock aboard the plane flyingwestward—against the earth’s rotation—is moving slower than the surface clock,which means that clock should run faster than the clock on the surface. And thatis exactly what was observed when, in an experiment performed in October 1971, avery accurate atomic clock was flown around the world. So you could extend yourlife by constantly flying eastward around the world, though you might get tiredof watching all those airline movies. However, the effect is very small, about180 billionths of a second per circuit (and it is also somewhat lessened by theeffects of the difference in gravity, but we need not get into that here).Due to the work of Einstein, physicists realized that by demanding that thespeed of light be the same in all frames of reference, Maxwell’s theory ofelectricity and magnetism dictates that time cannot be treated as separate fromthe three dimensions of space. Instead, time and space are intertwined. It issomething like adding a fourth direction of future/past to the usual left/right,forward/backward, and up/down. Physicists call this marriage of space and time“space-time,” and because space-time includes a fourth direction, they call itthe fourth dimension. In space-time, time is no longer separate from the threedimensions of space, and, loosely speaking, just as the definition ofleft/right, forward/backward, or up/down depends on the orientation of theobserver, so too does the direction of time vary depending on the speed of theobserver. Observers moving at different speeds would choose different directionsfor time in space-time. Einstein’s theory of special relativity was therefore anew model, which got rid of the concepts of absolute time and absolute rest(i.e., rest with respect to the fixed ether).Einstein soon realized that to make gravity compatible with relativity anotherchange was necessary. According to Newton’s theory of gravity, at any given timeobjects are attracted to each other by a force that depends on the distancebetween them at that time. But the theory of relativity had abolished theconcept of absolute time, so there was no way to define when the distancebetween the masses should be measured. Thus Newton’s theory of gravity was notconsistent with special relativity and had to be modified. The conflict mightsound like a mere technical difficulty, perhaps even a detail that could somehowbe worked around without much change in the theory. As it turned out, nothingcould have been further from the truth.Over the next eleven years Einstein developed a new theory of gravity, which hecalled general relativity. The concept of gravity in general relativity isnothing like Newton’s. Instead, it is based on the revolutionary proposal thatspace-time is not flat, as had been assumed previously, but is curved anddistorted by the mass and energy in it.A good way to picture curvature is to think of the surface of the earth.Although the earth’s surface is only two-dimensional (because there are only twodirections along it, say north/south and east/west), we’re going to use it asour example because a curved two-dimensional space is easier to picture than acurved four-dimensional space. The geometry of curved spaces such as the earth’ssurface is not the Euclidean geometry we are familiar with. For example, on theearth’s surface, the shortest distance between two points—which we know as aline in Euclidean geometry—is the path connecting the two points along what iscalled a great circle. (A great circle is a circle along the earth’s surfacewhose center coincides with the center of the earth. The equator is an exampleof a great circle, and so is any circle obtained by rotating the equator alongdifferent diameters.)Imagine, say, that you wanted to travel from New York to Madrid, two cities thatare at almost the same latitude. If the earth were flat, the shortest routewould be to head straight east. If you did that, you would arrive in Madridafter traveling 3,707 miles. But due to the earth’s curvature, there is a paththat on a flat map looks curved and hence longer, but which is actually shorter.You can get there in 3,605 miles if you follow the great-circle route, which isto first head northeast, then gradually turn east, and then southeast. Thedifference in distance between the two routes is due to the earth’s curvature,and a sign of its non-Euclidean geometry. Airlines know this, and arrange fortheir pilots to follow great-circle routes whenever practical.According to Newton’s laws of motion, objects such as cannonballs, croissants,and planets move in straight lines unless acted upon by a force, such asgravity. But gravity, in Einstein’s theory, is not a force like other forces;rather, it is a consequence of the fact that mass distorts space-time, creatingcurvature. In Einstein’s theory, objects move on geodesics, which are thenearest things to straight lines in a curved space. Lines are geodesics on theflat plane, and great circles are geodesics on the surface of the earth. In theabsence of matter, the geodesics in four-dimensional space-time correspond tolines in three-dimensional space. But when matter is present, distortingspace-time, the paths of bodies in the corresponding three-dimensional spacecurve in a manner that in Newtonian theory was explained by the attraction ofgravity. When space-time is not flat, objects’ paths appear to be bent, givingthe impression that a force is acting on them.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_056_r1.jpg]Einstein’s general theory of relativity reproduces special relativity whengravity is absent, and it makes almost the same predictions as Newton’s theoryof gravity in the weak-gravity environment of our solar system—but not quite. Infact, if general relativity were not taken into account in GPS satellitenavigation systems, errors in global positions would accumulate at a rate ofabout ten kilometers each day! However, the real importance of generalrelativity is not its application in devices that guide you to new restaurants,but rather that it is a very different model of the universe, which predicts neweffects such as gravitational waves and black holes. And so general relativityhas transformed physics into geometry. Modern technology is sensitive enough toallow us to perform many sensitive tests of general relativity, and it haspassed every one.Though they both revolutionized physics, Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetismand Einstein’s theory of gravity—general relativity—are both, like Newton’s ownphysics, classical theories. That is, they are models in which the universe hasa single history. As we saw in the last chapter, at the atomic and subatomiclevels these models do not agree with observations. Instead, we have to usequantum theories in which the universe can have any possible history, each withits own intensity or probability amplitude. For practical calculations involvingthe everyday world, we can continue to use classical theories, but if we wish tounderstand the behavior of atoms and molecules, we need a quantum version ofMaxwell’s theory of electromagnetism; and if we want to understand the earlyuniverse, when all the matter and energy in the universe were squeezed into asmall volume, we must have a quantum version of the theory of generalrelativity. We also need such theories because if we are seeking a fundamentalunderstanding of nature, it would not be consistent if some of the laws werequantum while others were classical. We therefore have to find quantum versionsof all the laws of nature. Such theories are called quantum field theories.The known forces of nature can be divided into four classes:1. Gravity. This is the weakest of the four, but it is a long-range force andacts on everything in the universe as an attraction. This means that for largebodies the gravitational forces all add up and can dominate over all otherforces.2. Electromagnetism. This is also long-range and is much stronger than gravity,but it acts only on particles with an electric charge, being repulsive betweencharges of the same sign and attractive between charges of the opposite sign.This means the electric forces between large bodies cancel each other out, buton the scales of atoms and molecules they dominate. Electromagnetic forces areresponsible for all of chemistry and biology.3. Weak nuclear force. This causes radioactivity and plays a vital role in theformation of the elements in stars and the early universe. We don’t, however,come into contact with this force in our everyday lives.4. Strong nuclear force. This force holds together the protons and neutronsinside the nucleus of an atom. It also holds together the protons and neutronsthemselves, which is necessary because they are made of still tinier particles,the quarks we mentioned in Chapter 3 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c003_r1.htm]. Thestrong force is the energy source for the sun and nuclear power, but, as withthe weak force, we don’t have direct contact with it.The first force for which a quantum version was created was electromagnetism.The quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, called quantum electrodynamics,or QED for short, was developed in the 1940s by Richard Feynman and others, andhas become a model for all quantum field theories. As we’ve said, according toclassical theories, forces are transmitted by fields. But in quantum fieldtheories the force fields are pictured as being made of various elementaryparticles called bosons, which are force-carrying particles that fly back andforth between matter particles, transmitting the forces. The matter particlesare called fermions. Electrons and quarks are examples of fermions. The photon,or particle of light, is an example of a boson. It is the boson that transmitsthe electromagnetic force. What happens is that a matter particle, such as anelectron, emits a boson, or force particle, and recoils from it, much as acannon recoils after firing a cannonball. The force particle then collides withanother matter particle and is absorbed, changing the motion of that particle.According to QED, all the interactions between charged particles—particles thatfeel the electromagnetic force—are described in terms of the exchange ofphotons.The predictions of QED have been tested and found to match experimental resultswith great precision. But performing the mathematical calculations required byQED can be difficult. The problem, as we’ll see below, is that when you add tothe above framework of particle exchange the quantum requirement that oneinclude all the histories by which an interaction can occur—for example, all theways the force particles can be exchanged—the mathematics becomes complicated.Fortunately, along with inventing the notion of alternative histories—the way ofthinking about quantum theories described in the last chapter—Feynman alsodeveloped a neat graphical method of accounting for the different histories, amethod that is today applied not just to QED but to all quantum field theories.Feynman’s graphical method provides a way of visualizing each term in the sumover histories. Those pictures, called Feynman diagrams, are one of the mostimportant tools of modern physics. In QED the sum over all possible historiescan be represented as a sum over Feynman diagrams like those below, whichrepresent some of the ways it is possible for two electrons to scatter off eachother through the electromagnetic force. In these diagrams the solid linesrepresent the electrons and the wavy lines represent photons. Time is understoodas progressing from bottom to top, and places where lines join correspond tophotons being emitted or absorbed by an electron. Diagram (A) represents the twoelectrons approaching each other, exchanging a photon, and then continuing ontheir way. That is the simplest way in which two electrons can interactelectromagnetically, but we must consider all possible histories. Hence we mustalso include diagrams like (B). That diagram also pictures two lines comingin—the approaching electrons—and two lines going out—the scattered ones—but inthis diagram the electrons exchange two photons before flying off. The diagramspictured are only a few of the possibilities; in fact, there are an infinitenumber of diagrams, which must be mathematically accounted for.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_057_r1.jpg]Feynman diagrams aren’t just a neat way of picturing and categorizing howinteractions can occur. Feynman diagrams come with rules that allow you to readoff, from the lines and vertices in each diagram, a mathematical expression. Theprobability, say, that the incoming electrons, with some given initial momentum,will end up flying off with some particular final momentum is then obtained bysumming the contributions from each Feynman diagram. That can take some work,because, as we’ve said, there are an infinite number of them. Moreover, althoughthe incoming and outgoing electrons are assigned a definite energy and momentum,the particles in the closed loops in the interior of the diagram can have anyenergy and momentum. That is important because in forming the Feynman sum onemust sum not only over all diagrams but also over all those values of energy andmomentum.Feynman diagrams provided physicists with enormous help in visualizing andcalculating the probabilities of the processes described by QED. But they didnot cure one important ailment suffered by the theory: When you add thecontributions from the infinite number of different histories, you get aninfinite result. (If the successive terms in an infinite sum decrease fastenough, it is possible for the sum to be finite, but that, unfortunately,doesn’t happen here.) In particular, when the Feynman diagrams are added up, theanswer seems to imply that the electron has an infinite mass and charge. This isabsurd, because we can measure the mass and charge and they are finite. To dealwith these infinities, a procedure called renormalization was developed.The process of renormalization involves subtracting quantities that are definedto be infinite and negative in such a way that, with careful mathematicalaccounting, the sum of the negative infinite values and the positive infinitevalues that arise in the theory almost cancel out, leaving a small remainder,the finite observed values of mass and charge. These manipulations might soundlike the sort of things that get you a flunking grade on a school math exam, andrenormalization is indeed, as it sounds, mathematically dubious. One consequenceis that the values obtained by this method for the mass and charge of theelectron can be any finite number. That has the advantage that physicists maychoose the negative infinities in a way that gives the right answer, but thedisadvantage that the mass and charge of the electron therefore cannot bepredicted from the theory. But once we have fixed the mass and charge of theelectron in this manner, we can employ QED to make many other very precisepredictions, which all agree extremely closely with observation, sorenormalization is one of the essential ingredients of QED. An early triumph ofQED, for example, was the correct prediction of the so-called Lamb shift, asmall change in the energy of one of the states of the hydrogen atom discoveredin 1947.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_058_r1.jpg]The success of renormalization in QED encouraged attempts to look for quantumfield theories describing the other three forces of nature. But the division ofnatural forces into four classes is probably artificial and a consequence of ourlack of understanding. People have therefore sought a theory of everything thatwill unify the four classes into a single law that is compatible with quantumtheory. This would be the holy grail of physics.One indication that unification is the right approach came from the theory ofthe weak force. The quantum field theory describing the weak force on its owncannot be renormalized; that is, it has infinities that cannot be canceled bysubtracting a finite number of quantities such as mass and charge. However, in1967 Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg each independently proposed a theory inwhich electromagnetism was unified with the weak force, and found that theunification cured the plague of infinities. The unified force is called theelectroweak force. Its theory could be renormalized, and it predicted three newparticles called W+, W–, and Z0. Evidence for the Z0 was discovered at CERN inGeneva in 1973. Salam and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1979,although the W and Z particles were not observed directly until 1983.The strong force can be renormalized on its own in a theory called QCD, orquantum chromodynamics. According to QCD, the proton, the neutron, and manyother elementary particles of matter are made of quarks, which have a remarkableproperty that physicists have come to call color (hence the term“chromodynamics,” although quark colors are just helpful labels—there is noconnection with visible color). Quarks come in three so-called colors, red,green, and blue. In addition, each quark has an anti-particle partner, and thecolors of those particles are called anti-red, anti-green, and anti-blue. Theidea is that only combinations with no net color can exist as free particles.There are two ways to achieve such neutral quark combinations. A color and itsanti-color cancel, so a quark and an anti-quark form a colorless pair, anunstable particle called a meson. Also, when all the three colors (oranti-colors) are mixed, the result has no net color. Three quarks, one of eachcolor, form stable particles called baryons, of which protons and neutrons areexamples (and three anti-quarks form the anti-particles of the baryons). Protonsand neutrons are the baryons that make up the nucleus of atoms and are the basisfor all normal matter in the universe.QCD also has a property called asymptotic freedom, which we referred to, withoutnaming it, in Chapter 3 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c003_r1.htm]. Asymptoticfreedom means that the strong forces between quarks are small when the quarksare close together but increase if they are farther apart, rather as though theywere joined by rubber bands. Asymptotic freedom explains why we don’t seeisolated quarks in nature and have been unable to produce them in thelaboratory. Still, even though we cannot observe individual quarks, we acceptthe model because it works so well at explaining the behavior of protons,neutrons, and other particles of matter.After uniting the weak and electromagnetic forces, physicists in the 1970slooked for a way to bring the strong force into that theory. There are a numberof so-called grand unified theories or GUTs that unify the strong forces withthe weak force and electromagnetism, but they mostly predict that protons, thestuff that we are made of, should decay, on average, after about 1032 years.That is a very long lifetime, given that the universe is only about 1010 yearsold. But in quantum physics, when we say the average lifetime of a particle is1032 years, we don’t mean that most particles live approximately 1032 years,some a bit more and some a bit less. Instead, what we mean is that, each year,the particle has a 1 in 1032 chance of decaying. As a result, if you watch atank containing 1032 protons for just a few years, you ought to see some of theprotons decay. It is not too hard to build such a tank, since 1032 protons arecontained in just a thousand tons of water. Scientists have performed suchexperiments. It turns out that detecting the decays and differentiating themfrom other events caused by the cosmic rays that continually shower us fromspace is no easy matter. To minimize the noise, the experiments are carried outdeep inside places such as the Kamioka Mining and Smelting Company’s mine 3,281feet under a mountain in Japan, which is somewhat shielded from cosmic rays. Asa result of observations in 2009, researchers have concluded that if protonsdecay at all, the proton lifetime is greater than about 1034 years, which is badnews for grand unified theories.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_059_r1.jpg]Since earlier observational evidence had also failed to support GUTs, mostphysicists adopted an ad hoc theory called the standard model, which comprisesthe unified theory of the electroweak forces and QCD as a theory of the strongforces. But in the standard model, the electroweak and strong forces actseparately and are not truly unified. The standard model is very successful andagrees with all current observational evidence, but it is ultimatelyunsatisfactory because, apart from not unifying the electroweak and strongforces, it does not include gravity.It may have proved difficult to meld the strong force with the electromagneticand weak forces, but those problems are nothing compared with the problem ofmerging gravity with the other three, or even of creating a stand-alone quantumtheory of gravity. The reason a quantum theory of gravity has proven so hard tocreate has to do with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which we discussedin Chapter 4 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c004_r1.htm]. It is not obvious, but itturns out that with regard to that principle, the value of a field and its rateof change play the same role as the position and velocity of a particle. Thatis, the more accurately one is determined, the less accurately the other can be.An important consequence of that is that there is no such thing as empty space.That is because empty space means that both the value of a field and its rate ofchange are exactly zero. (If the field’s rate of change were not zero, the spacewould not remain empty.) Since the uncertainty principle does not allow thevalues of both the field and the rate of change to be exact, space is neverempty. It can have a state of minimum energy, called the vacuum, but that stateis subject to what are called quantum jitters, or vacuum fluctuations—particlesand fields quivering in and out of existence.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_060_r1.jpg]One can think of the vacuum fluctuations as pairs of particles that appeartogether at some time, move apart, then come together and annihilate each other.In terms of Feynman diagrams, they correspond to closed loops. These particlesare called virtual particles. Unlike real particles, virtual particles cannot beobserved directly with a particle detector. However, their indirect effects,such as small changes in the energy of electron orbits, can be measured, andagree with theoretical predictions to a remarkable degree of accuracy. Theproblem is that the virtual particles have energy, and because there are aninfinite number of virtual pairs, they would have an infinite amount of energy.According to general relativity, this means that they would curve the universeto an infinitely small size, which obviously does not happen!This plague of infinities is similar to the problem that occurs in the theoriesof the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces, except in those casesrenormalization removes the infinities. But the closed loops in the Feynmandiagrams for gravity produce infinities that cannot be absorbed byrenormalization because in general relativity there are not enoughrenormalizable parameters (such as the values of mass and charge) to remove allthe quantum infinities from the theory. We are therefore left with a theory ofgravity that predicts that certain quantities, such as the curvature ofspace-time, are infinite, which is no way to run a habitable universe. Thatmeans the only possibility of obtaining a sensible theory would be for all theinfinities to somehow cancel, without resorting to renormalization.In 1976 a possible solution to that problem was found. It is calledsupergravity. The prefix “super” was not appended because physicists thought itwas “super” that this theory of quantum gravity might actually work. Instead,“super” refers to a kind of symmetry the theory possesses, called supersymmetry.In physics a system is said to have a symmetry if its properties are unaffectedby a certain transformation such as rotating it in space or taking its mirrorimage. For example, if you flip a donut over, it looks exactly the same (unlessit has a chocolate topping, in which case it is better just to eat it).Supersymmetry is a more subtle kind of symmetry that cannot be associated with atransformation of ordinary space. One of the important implications ofsupersymmetry is that force particles and matter particles, and hence force andmatter, are really just two facets of the same thing. Practically speaking, thatmeans that each matter particle, such as a quark, ought to have a partnerparticle that is a force particle, and each force particle, such as the photon,ought to have a partner particle that is a matter particle. This has thepotential to solve the problem of infinities because it turns out that theinfinities from closed loops of force particles are positive while theinfinities from closed loops of matter particles are negative, so the infinitiesin the theory arising from the force particles and their partner matterparticles tend to cancel out. Unfortunately, the calculations required to findout whether there would be any infinities left uncanceled in supergravity wereso long and difficult and had such potential for error that no one was preparedto undertake them. Most physicists believed, nonetheless, that supergravity wasprobably the right answer to the problem of unifying gravity with the otherforces.You might think that the validity of supersymmetry would be an easy thing tocheck—just examine the properties of the existing particles and see if they pairup. No such partner particles have been observed. But various calculations thatphysicists have performed indicate that the partner particles corresponding tothe particles we observe ought to be a thousand times as massive as a proton, ifnot even heavier. That is too heavy for such particles to have been seen in anyexperiments to date, but there is hope that such particles will eventually becreated in the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.The idea of supersymmetry was the key to the creation of supergravity, but theconcept had actually originated years earlier with theorists studying afledgling theory called string theory. According to string theory, particles arenot points, but patterns of vibration that have length but no height orwidth—like infinitely thin pieces of string. String theories also lead toinfinities, but it is believed that in the right version they will all cancelout. They have another unusual feature: They are consistent only if space-timehas ten dimensions, instead of the usual four. Ten dimensions might soundexciting, but they would cause real problems if you forgot where you parked yourcar. If they are present, why don’t we notice these extra dimensions? Accordingto string theory, they are curved up into a space of very small size. To picturethis, imagine a two-dimensional plane. We call the plane two-dimensional becauseyou need two numbers (for instance, horizontal and vertical coordinates) tolocate any point on it. Another two-dimensional space is the surface of a straw.To locate a point on that space, you need to know where along the straw’s lengththe point is, and also where along its circular dimension. But if the straw isvery thin, you would get a very good approximate position employing only thecoordinate that runs along the straw’s length, so you might ignore the circulardimension. And if the straw were a million-million-million-million-millionth ofan inch in diameter, you wouldn’t notice the circular dimension at all. That isthe picture string theorists have of the extra dimensions—they are highlycurved, or curled, on a scale so small that we don’t see them. In string theorythe extra dimensions are curled up into what is called the internal space, asopposed to the three-dimensional space that we experience in everyday life. Aswe’ll see, these internal states are not just hidden dimensions swept under therug—they have important physical significance.In addition to the question of dimensions, string theory suffered from anotherawkward issue: There appeared to be at least five different theories andmillions of ways the extra dimensions could be curled up, which was quite anembarrassment of possibilities for those advocating that string theory was theunique theory of everything. Then, around 1994, people started to discoverdualities—that different string theories, and different ways of curling up theextra dimensions, are simply different ways of describing the same phenomena infour dimensions. Moreover, they found that supergravity is also related to theother theories in this way. String theorists are now convinced that the fivedifferent string theories and supergravity are just different approximations toa more fundamental theory, each valid in different situations.That more fundamental theory is called M-theory, as we mentioned earlier. No oneseems to know what the “M” stands for, but it may be “master,” “miracle,” or“mystery.” It seems to be all three. People are still trying to decipher thenature of M-theory, but that may not be possible. It could be that thephysicist’s traditional expectation of a single theory of nature is untenable,and there exists no single formulation. It might be that to describe theuniverse, we have to employ different theories in different situations. Eachtheory may have its own version of reality, but according to model-dependentrealism, that is acceptable so long as the theories agree in their predictionswhenever they overlap, that is, whenever they can both be applied.Whether M-theory exists as a single formulation or only as a network, we do knowsome of its properties. First, M-theory has eleven space-time dimensions, notten. String theorists had long suspected that the prediction of ten dimensionsmight have to be adjusted, and recent work showed that one dimension had indeedbeen overlooked. Also, M-theory can contain not just vibrating strings but alsopoint particles, two-dimensional membranes, three-dimensional blobs, and otherobjects that are more difficult to picture and occupy even more dimensions ofspace, up to nine. These objects are called p-branes (where p runs from zero tonine).[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_061_r1.jpg]What about the enormous number of ways to curl up the tiny dimensions? InM-theory those extra space dimensions cannot be curled up in just any way. Themathematics of the theory restricts the manner in which the dimensions of theinternal space can be curled. The exact shape of the internal space determinesboth the values of physical constants, such as the charge of the electron, andthe nature of the interactions between elementary particles. In other words, itdetermines the apparent laws of nature. We say “apparent” because we mean thelaws that we observe in our universe—the laws of the four forces, and theparameters such as mass and charge that characterize the elementary particles.But the more fundamental laws are those of M-theory.The laws of M-theory therefore allow for different universes with differentapparent laws, depending on how the internal space is curled. M-theory hassolutions that allow for many different internal spaces, perhaps as many as10500, which means it allows for 10500 different universes, each with its ownlaws. To get an idea how many that is, think about this: If some being couldanalyze the laws predicted for each of those universes in just one millisecondand had started working on it at the big bang, at present that being would havestudied just 1020 of them. And that’s without coffee breaks.Centuries ago Newton showed that mathematical equations could provide astartlingly accurate description of the way objects interact, both on earth andin the heavens. Scientists were led to believe that the future of the entireuniverse could be laid out if only we knew the proper theory and had enoughcomputing power. Then came quantum uncertainty, curved space, quarks, strings,and extra dimensions, and the net result of their labor is 10500 universes, eachwith different laws, only one of which corresponds to the universe as we knowit. The original hope of physicists to produce a single theory explaining theapparent laws of our universe as the unique possible consequence of a few simpleassumptions may have to be abandoned. Where does that leave us? If M-theoryallows for 10500 sets of apparent laws, how did we end up in this universe, withthe laws that are apparent to us? And what about those other possible worlds?

One day Bumba, in pain from a stomachache, vomited up the sun. Intime the sun dried up some of the water, leaving land. But Bumba was still inpain, and vomited some more. Up came the moon, the stars, and then some animals:the leopard, the crocodile, the turtle, and finally man. The Mayans of Mexicoand Central America tell of a similar time before creation when all that existedwere the sea, the sky, and the Maker. In the Mayan legend the Maker, unhappybecause there was no one to praise him, created the earth, mountains, trees, andmost animals. But the animals could not speak, and so he decided to createhumans. First he made them of mud and earth, but they only spoke nonsense. Helet them dissolve away and tried again, this time fashioning people from wood.Those people were dull. He decided to destroy them, but they escaped into theforest, sustaining damage along the way that altered them slightly, creatingwhat we today know as monkeys. After that fiasco, the Maker finally came upon aformula that worked, and constructed the first humans from white and yellowcorn. Today we make ethanol from corn, but so far haven’t matched the Maker’sfeat of constructing the people who drink it.Creation myths like these all attempt to answer the questions we address in thisbook: Why is there a universe, and why is the universe the way it is? Ourability to address such questions has grown steadily in the centuries since theancient Greeks, most profoundly over the past century. Armed with the backgroundof the previous chapters, we are now ready to offer a possible answer to thesequestions.One thing that may have been apparent even in early times was that either theuniverse was a very recent creation or else human beings have existed for only asmall fraction of cosmic history. That’s because the human race has beenimproving so rapidly in knowledge and technology that if people had been aroundfor millions of years, the human race would be much further along in itsmastery.According to the Old Testament, God created Adam and Eve only six days intocreation. Bishop Ussher, primate of all Ireland from 1625 to 1656, placed theorigin of the world even more precisely, at nine in the morning on October 27,4004 BC. We take a different view: that humans are a recent creation but thatthe universe itself began much earlier, about 13.7 billion years ago.The first actual scientific evidence that the universe had a beginning came inthe 1920s. As we said in Chapter 3 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c003_r1.htm], thatwas a time when most scientists believed in a static universe that had alwaysexisted. The evidence to the contrary was indirect, based upon the observationsEdwin Hubble made with the 100-inch telescope on Mount Wilson, in the hillsabove Pasadena, California. By analyzing the spectrum of light they emit, Hubbledetermined that nearly all galaxies are moving away from us, and the fartheraway they are, the faster they are moving. In 1929 he published a law relatingtheir rate of recession to their distance from us, and concluded that theuniverse is expanding. If that is true, then the universe must have been smallerin the past. In fact, if we extrapolate to the distant past, all the matter andenergy in the universe would have been concentrated in a very tiny region ofunimaginable density and temperature, and if we go back far enough, there wouldbe a time when it all began—the event we now call the big bang.The idea that the universe is expanding involves a bit of subtlety. For example,we don’t mean the universe is expanding in the manner that, say, one mightexpand one’s house, by knocking out a wall and positioning a new bathroom whereonce there stood a majestic oak. Rather than space extending itself, it is thedistance between any two points within the universe that is growing. That ideaemerged in the 1930s amid much controversy, but one of the best ways tovisualize it is still a metaphor enunciated in 1931 by Cambridge Universityastronomer Arthur Eddington. Eddington visualized the universe as the surface ofan expanding balloon, and all the galaxies as points on that surface. Thispicture clearly illustrates why far galaxies recede more quickly than nearbyones. For example, if the radius of the balloon doubled each hour, then thedistance between any two galaxies on the balloon would double each hour. If atsome time two galaxies were 1 inch apart, an hour later they would be 2 inchesapart, and they would appear to be moving relative to each other at a rate of 1inch per hour. But if they started 2 inches apart, an hour later they would beseparated by 4 inches and would appear to be moving away from each other at arate of 2 inches per hour. That is just what Hubble found: the farther away agalaxy, the faster it was moving away from us.It is important to realize that the expansion of space does not affect the sizeof material objects such as galaxies, stars, apples, atoms, or other objectsheld together by some sort of force. For example, if we circled a cluster ofgalaxies on the balloon, that circle would not expand as the balloon expanded.Rather, because the galaxies are bound by gravitational forces, the circle andthe galaxies within it would keep their size and configuration as the balloonenlarged. This is important because we can detect expansion only if ourmeasuring instruments have fixed sizes. If everything were free to expand, thenwe, our yardsticks, our laboratories, and so on would all expand proportionatelyand we would not notice any difference.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_065_r1.jpg]That the universe is expanding was news to Einstein. But the possibility thatthe galaxies are moving away from each other had been proposed a few yearsbefore Hubble’s papers on theoretical grounds arising from Einstein’s ownequations. In 1922, Russian physicist and mathematician Alexander Friedmanninvestigated what would happen in a model universe based upon two assumptionsthat greatly simplified the mathematics: that the universe looks identical inevery direction, and that it looks that way from every observation point. Weknow that Friedmann’s first assumption is not exactly true—the universefortunately is not uniform everywhere! If we gaze upward in one direction, wemight see the sun; in another, the moon or a colony of migrating vampire bats.But the universe does appear to be roughly the same in every direction whenviewed on a scale that is far larger—larger even than the distance betweengalaxies. It is something like looking down at a forest. If you are closeenough, you can make out individual leaves, or at least trees, and the spacesbetween them. But if you are so high up that if you hold out your thumb itcovers a square mile of trees, the forest will appear to be a uniform shade ofgreen. We would say that, on that scale, the forest is uniform.Based on his assumptions Friedmann was able to discover a solution to Einstein’sequations in which the universe expanded in the manner that Hubble would soondiscover to be true. In particular, Friedmann’s model universe begins with zerosize and expands until gravitational attraction slows it down, and eventuallycauses it to collapse in upon itself. (There are, it turns out, two other typesof solutions to Einstein’s equations that also satisfy the assumptions ofFriedmann’s model, one corresponding to a universe in which the expansioncontinues forever, though it does slow a bit, and another to a universe in whichthe rate of expansion slows toward zero, but never quite reaches it.) Friedmanndied a few years after producing this work, and his ideas remained largelyunknown until after Hubble’s discovery. But in 1927 a professor of physics andRoman Catholic priest named Georges Lemaître proposed a similar idea: If youtrace the history of the universe backward into the past, it gets tinier andtinier until you come upon a creation event—what we now call the big bang.Not everyone liked the big bang picture. In fact, the term “big bang” was coinedin 1949 by Cambridge astrophysicist Fred Hoyle, who believed in a universe thatexpanded forever, and meant the term as a derisive description. The first directobservations supporting the idea didn’t come until 1965, with the discovery thatthere is a faint background of microwaves throughout space. This cosmicmicrowave background radiation, or CMBR, is the same as that in your microwaveoven, but much less powerful. You can observe the CMBR yourself by tuning yourtelevision to an unused channel—a few percent of the snow you see on the screenwill be caused by it. The radiation was discovered by accident by two Bell Labsscientists trying to eliminate such static from their microwave antenna. Atfirst they thought the static might be coming from the droppings of pigeonsroosting in their apparatus, but it turned out their problem had a moreinteresting origin—the CMBR is radiation left over from the very hot and denseearly universe that would have existed shortly after the big bang. As theuniverse expanded, it cooled until the radiation became just the faint remnantwe now observe. At present these microwaves could heat your food to only about−270 degrees Centigrade—3 degrees above absolute zero, and not very useful forpopping corn.Astronomers have also found other fingerprints supporting the big bang pictureof a hot, tiny early universe. For example, during the first minute or so, theuniverse would have been hotter than the center of a typical star. During thatperiod the entire universe would have acted as a nuclear fusion reactor. Thereactions would have ceased when the universe expanded and cooled sufficiently,but the theory predicts that this should have left a universe composed mainly ofhydrogen, but also about 23 percent helium, with traces of lithium (all heavierelements were made later, inside stars). The calculation is in good accordancewith the amounts of helium, hydrogen, and lithium we observe.Measurements of helium abundance and the CMBR provided convincing evidence infavor of the big bang picture of the very early universe, but although one canthink of the big bang picture as a valid description of early times, it is wrongto take the big bang literally, that is, to think of Einstein’s theory asproviding a true picture of the origin of the universe. That is because generalrelativity predicts there to be a point in time at which the temperature,density, and curvature of the universe are all infinite, a situationmathematicians call a singularity. To a physicist this means that Einstein’stheory breaks down at that point and therefore cannot be used to predict how theuniverse began, only how it evolved afterward. So although we can employ theequations of general relativity and our observations of the heavens to learnabout the universe at a very young age, it is not correct to carry the big bangpicture all the way back to the beginning.We will get to the issue of the origin of the universe shortly, but first a fewwords about the first phase of the expansion. Physicists call it inflation.Unless you’ve lived in Zimbabwe, where currency inflation recently exceeded200,000,000 percent, the term may not sound very explosive. But according toeven conservative estimates, during this cosmological inflation, the universeexpanded by a factor of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 in.00000000000000000000000000000000001 second. It was as if a coin 1 centimeter indiameter suddenly blew up to ten million times the width of the Milky Way. Thatmay seem to violate relativity, which dictates that nothing can move faster thanlight, but that speed limit does not apply to the expansion of space itself.The idea that such an episode of inflation might have occurred was firstproposed in 1980, based on considerations that go beyond Einstein’s theory ofgeneral relativity and take into account aspects of quantum theory. Since wedon’t have a complete quantum theory of gravity, the details are still beingworked out, and physicists aren’t sure exactly how inflation happened. Butaccording to the theory, the expansion caused by inflation would not becompletely uniform, as predicted by the traditional big bang picture. Theseirregularities would produce minuscule variations in the temperature of the CMBRin different directions. The variations are too small to have been observed inthe 1960s, but they were first discovered in 1992 by NASA’s COBE satellite, andlater measured by its successor, the WMAP satellite, launched in 2001. As aresult, we are now confident that inflation really did happen.Ironically, though tiny variations in the CMBR are evidence for inflation, onereason inflation is an important concept is the nearly perfect uniformity of thetemperature of the CMBR. If you make one part of an object hotter than itssurroundings and then wait, the hot spot will grow cooler and its surroundingswarmer until the temperature of the object is uniform. Similarly, one wouldexpect the universe to eventually have a uniform temperature. But this processtakes time, and if inflation hadn’t occurred, there wouldn’t have been enoughtime in the history of the universe for heat at widely separated regions toequalize, assuming that the speed of such heat transfer is limited by the speedof light. A period of very rapid expansion (much faster than light speed)remedies that because there would have been enough time for the equalization tohappen in the extremely tiny preinflationary early universe.Inflation explains the bang in the big bang, at least in the sense that theexpansion it represents was far more extreme than the expansion predicted by thetraditional big bang theory of general relativity during the time interval inwhich inflation occurred. The problem is, for our theoretical models ofinflation to work, the initial state of the universe had to be set up in a veryspecial and highly improbable way. Thus traditional inflation theory resolvesone set of issues but creates another—the need for a very special initial state.That time-zero issue is eliminated in the theory of the creation of the universewe are about to describe.Since we cannot describe creation employing Einstein’s theory of generalrelativity, if we want to describe the origin of the universe, generalrelativity has to be replaced by a more complete theory. One would expect toneed a more complete theory even if general relativity did not break down,because general relativity does not take into account the small-scale structureof matter, which is governed by quantum theory. We mentioned in Chapter 4[Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c004_r1.htm] that for most practical purposes quantumtheory does not hold much relevance for the study of the large-scale structureof the universe because quantum theory applies to the description of nature onmicroscopic scales. But if you go far enough back in time, the universe was assmall as the Planck size, a billion-trillion-trillionth of a centimeter, whichis the scale at which quantum theory does have to be taken into account. Sothough we don’t yet have a complete quantum theory of gravity, we do know thatthe origin of the universe was a quantum event. As a result, just as we combinedquantum theory and general relativity—at least provisionally—to derive thetheory of inflation, if we want to go back even further and understand theorigin of the universe, we must combine what we know about general relativitywith quantum theory.To see how this works, we need to understand the principle that gravity warpsspace and time. Warpage of space is easier to visualize than warpage of time.Imagine that the universe is the surface of a flat billiard table. The table’ssurface is a flat space, at least in two dimensions. If you roll a ball on thetable it will travel in a straight line. But if the table becomes warped ordented in places, as in the illustration below, then the ball will curve.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_066_r1.jpg]It is easy to see how the billiard table is warped in this example because it iscurving into an outside third dimension, which we can see. Since we can’t stepoutside our own space-time to view its warpage, the space-time warpage in ouruniverse is harder to imagine. But curvature can be detected even if you cannotstep out and view it from the perspective of a larger space. It can be detectedfrom within the space itself. Imagine a micro-ant confined to the surface of thetable. Even without the ability to leave the table, the ant could detect thewarpage by carefully charting distances. For example, the distance around acircle in flat space is always a bit more than three times the distance acrossits diameter (the actual multiple is π). But if the ant cut across a circleencompassing the well in the table pictured above, it would find that thedistance across is greater than expected, greater than one-third the distancearound it. In fact, if the well were deep enough, the ant would find that thedistance around the circle is shorter than the distance across it. The same istrue of warpage in our universe—it stretches or compresses the distance betweenpoints of space, changing its geometry, or shape, in a way that is measurablefrom within the universe. Warpage of time stretches or compresses time intervalsin an analogous manner.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_067_r1.jpg]Armed with these ideas, let’s return to the issue of the beginning of theuniverse. We can speak separately of space and time, as we have in thisdiscussion, in situations involving low speeds and weak gravity. In general,however, time and space can become intertwined, and so their stretching andcompressing also involve a certain amount of mixing. This mixing is important inthe early universe and the key to understanding the beginning of time.The issue of the beginning of time is a bit like the issue of the edge of theworld. When people thought the world was flat, one might have wondered whetherthe sea poured over its edge. This has been tested experimentally: One can goaround the world and not fall off. The problem of what happens at the edge ofthe world was solved when people realized that the world was not a flat plate,but a curved surface. Time, however, seemed to be like a model railway track. Ifit had a beginning, there would have to have been someone (i.e., God) to set thetrains going. Although Einstein’s general theory of relativity unified time andspace as space-time and involved a certain mixing of space and time, time wasstill different from space, and either had a beginning and an end or else wenton forever. However, once we add the effects of quantum theory to the theory ofrelativity, in extreme cases warpage can occur to such a great extent that timebehaves like another dimension of space.In the early universe—when the universe was small enough to be governed by bothgeneral relativity and quantum theory—there were effectively four dimensions ofspace and none of time. That means that when we speak of the “beginning” of theuniverse, we are skirting the subtle issue that as we look backward toward thevery early universe, time as we know it does not exist! We must accept that ourusual ideas of space and time do not apply to the very early universe. That isbeyond our experience, but not beyond our imagination, or our mathematics. If inthe early universe all four dimensions behave like space, what happens to thebeginning of time?The realization that time can behave like another direction of space means onecan get rid of the problem of time having a beginning, in a similar way in whichwe got rid of the edge of the world. Suppose the beginning of the universe waslike the South Pole of the earth, with degrees of latitude playing the role oftime. As one moves north, the circles of constant latitude, representing thesize of the universe, would expand. The universe would start as a point at theSouth Pole, but the South Pole is much like any other point. To ask whathappened before the beginning of the universe would become a meaninglessquestion, because there is nothing south of the South Pole. In this picturespace-time has no boundary—the same laws of nature hold at the South Pole as inother places. In an analogous manner, when one combines the general theory ofrelativity with quantum theory, the question of what happened before thebeginning of the universe is rendered meaningless. This idea that historiesshould be closed surfaces without boundary is called the no-boundary condition.Over the centures many, including Aristotle, believed that the universe musthave always existed in order to avoid the issue of how it was set up. Othersbelieved the universe had a beginning, and used it as an argument for theexistence of God. The realization that time behaves like space presents a newalternative. It removes the age-old objection to the universe having abeginning, but also means that the beginning of the universe was governed by thelaws of science and doesn’t need to be set in motion by some god.If the origin of the universe was a quantum event, it should be accuratelydescribed by the Feynman sum over histories. To apply quantum theory to theentire universe—where the observers are part of the system being observed—istricky, however. In Chapter 4 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c004_r1.htm] we saw howparticles of matter fired at a screen with two slits in it could exhibitinterference patterns just as water waves do. Feynman showed that this arisesbecause a particle does not have a unique history. That is, as it moves from itsstarting point A to some endpoint B, it doesn’t take one definite path, butrather simultaneously takes every possible path connecting the two points. Fromthis point of view, interference is no surprise because, for instance, theparticle can travel through both slits at the same time and interfere withitself. Applied to the motion of a particle, Feynman’s method tells us that tocalculate the probability of any particular endpoint we need to consider all thepossible histories that the particle might follow from its starting point tothat endpoint. One can also use Feynman’s methods to calculate the quantumprobabilities for observations of the universe. If they are applied to theuniverse as a whole, there is no point A, so we add up all the histories thatsatisfy the no-boundary condition and end at the universe we observe today.In this view, the universe appeared spontaneously, starting off in everypossible way. Most of these correspond to other universes. While some of thoseuniverses are similar to ours, most are very different. They aren’t justdifferent in details, such as whether Elvis really did die young or whetherturnips are a dessert food, but rather they differ even in their apparent lawsof nature. In fact, many universes exist with many different sets of physicallaws. Some people make a great mystery of this idea, sometimes called themultiverse concept, but these are just different expressions of the Feynman sumover histories.To picture this, let’s alter Eddington’s balloon analogy and instead think ofthe expanding universe as the surface of a bubble. Our picture of thespontaneous quantum creation of the universe is then a bit like the formation ofbubbles of steam in boiling water. Many tiny bubbles appear, and then disappearagain. These represent mini-universes that expand but collapse again while stillof microscopic size. They represent possible alternative universes, but they arenot of much interest since they do not last long enough to develop galaxies andstars, let alone intelligent life. A few of the little bubbles, however, willgrow large enough so that they will be safe from recollapse. They will continueto expand at an ever-increasing rate and will form the bubbles of steam we areable to see. These correspond to universes that start off expanding at anever-increasing rate—in other words, universes in a state of inflation.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_068_r1.jpg]As we said, the expansion caused by inflation would not be completely uniform.In the sum over histories, there is only one completely uniform and regularhistory, and it will have the greatest probability, but many other historiesthat are very slightly irregular will have probabilities that are almost ashigh. That is why inflation predicts that the early universe is likely to beslightly nonuniform, corresponding to the small variations in the temperaturethat were observed in the CMBR. The irregularities in the early universe arelucky for us. Why? Homogeneity is good if you don’t want cream separating outfrom your milk, but a uniform universe is a boring universe. The irregularitiesin the early universe are important because if some regions had a slightlyhigher density than others, the gravitational attraction of the extra densitywould slow the expansion of that region compared with its surroundings. As theforce of gravity slowly draws matter together, it can eventually cause it tocollapse to form galaxies and stars, which can lead to planets and, on at leastone occasion, people. So look carefully at the map of the microwave sky. It isthe blueprint for all the structure in the universe. We are the product ofquantum fluctuations in the very early universe. If one were religious, onecould say that God really does play dice.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_069_r1.jpg]This idea leads to a view of the universe that is profoundly different from thetraditional concept, requiring us to adjust the way that we think about thehistory of the universe. In order to make predictions in cosmology, we need tocalculate the probabilities of different states of the entire universe at thepresent time. In physics one normally assumes some initial state for a systemand evolves it forward in time employing the relevant mathematical equations.Given the state of a system at one time, one tries to calculate the probabilitythat the system will be in some different state at a later time. The usualassumption in cosmology is that the universe has a single definite history. Onecan use the laws of physics to calculate how this history develops with time. Wecall this the “bottom-up” approach to cosmology. But since we must take intoaccount the quantum nature of the universe as expressed by the Feynman sum overhistories, the probability amplitude that the universe is now in a particularstate is arrived at by adding up the contributions from all the histories thatsatisfy the no-boundary condition and end in the state in question. Incosmology, in other words, one shouldn’t follow the history of the universe fromthe bottom up because that assumes there’s a single history, with a well-definedstarting point and evolution. Instead, one should trace the histories from thetop down, backward from the present time. Some histories will be more probablethan others, and the sum will normally be dominated by a single history thatstarts with the creation of the universe and culminates in the state underconsideration. But there will be different histories for different possiblestates of the universe at the present time. This leads to a radically differentview of cosmology, and the relation between cause and effect. The histories thatcontribute to the Feynman sum don’t have an independent existence, but depend onwhat is being measured. We create history by our observation, rather thanhistory creating us.The idea that the universe does not have a unique observer-independent historymight seem to conflict with certain facts we know. There might be one history inwhich the moon is made of Roquefort cheese. But we have observed that the moonis not made of cheese, which is bad news for mice. Hence histories in which themoon is made of cheese do not contribute to the present state of our universe,though they might contribute to others. That might sound like science fiction,but it isn’t.An important implication of the top-down approach is that the apparent laws ofnature depend on the history of the universe. Many scientists believe thereexists a single theory that explains those laws as well as nature’s physicalconstants, such as the mass of the electron or the dimensionality of space-time.But top-down cosmology dictates that the apparent laws of nature are differentfor different histories.Consider the apparent dimension of the universe. According to M-theory,space-time has ten space dimensions and one time dimension. The idea is thatseven of the space dimensions are curled up so small that we don’t notice them,leaving us with the illusion that all that exist are the three remaining largedimensions we are familiar with. One of the central open questions in M-theoryis: Why, in our universe, aren’t there more large dimensions, and why are anydimensions curled up?Many people would like to believe that there is some mechanism that causes allbut three of the space dimensions to curl up spontaneously. Alternatively, maybeall dimensions started small, but for some understandable reason three spacedimensions expanded and the rest did not. It seems, however, that there is nodynamical reason for the universe to appear four-dimensional. Instead, top-downcosmology predicts that the number of large space dimensions is not fixed by anyprinciple of physics. There will be a quantum probability amplitude for everynumber of large space dimensions from zero to ten. The Feynman sum allows forall of these, for every possible history for the universe, but the observationthat our universe has three large space dimensions selects out the subclass ofhistories that have the property that is being observed. In other words, thequantum probability that the universe has more or less than three large spacedimensions is irrelevant because we have already determined that we are in auniverse with three large space dimensions. So as long as the probabilityamplitude for three large space dimensions is not exactly zero, it doesn’tmatter how small it is compared with the probability amplitude for other numbersof dimensions. It would be like asking for the probability amplitude that thepresent pope is Chinese. We know that he is German, even though the probabilitythat he is Chinese is higher because there are more Chinese than there areGermans. Similarly, we know our universe exhibits three large space dimensions,and so even though other numbers of large space dimensions may have a greaterprobability amplitude, we are interested only in histories with three.What about the curled-up dimensions? Recall that in M-theory the precise shapeof the remaining curled-up dimensions, the internal space, determines both thevalues of physical quantities such as the charge on the electron and the natureof the interactions between elementary particles, that is, the forces of nature.Things would have worked out neatly if M-theory had allowed just one shape forthe curled dimensions, or perhaps a few, all but one of which might have beenruled out by some means, leaving us with just one possibility for the apparentlaws of nature. Instead, there are probability amplitudes for perhaps as many as10500 different internal spaces, each leading to different laws and values forthe physical constants.If one builds the history of the universe from the bottom up, there is no reasonthe universe should end up with the internal space for the particle interactionsthat we actually observe, the standard model (of elementary particleinteractions). But in the top-down approach we accept that universes exist withall possible internal spaces. In some universes electrons have the weight ofgolf balls and the force of gravity is stronger than that of magnetism. In ours,the standard model, with all its parameters, applies. One can calculate theprobability amplitude for the internal space that leads to the standard model onthe basis of the no-boundary condition. As with the probability of there being auniverse with three large space dimensions, it doesn’t matter how small thisamplitude is relative to other possibilities because we already observed thatthe standard model describes our universe.The theory we describe in this chapter is testable. In the prior examples weemphasized that the relative probability amplitudes for radically differentuniverses, such as those with a different number of large space dimensions,don’t matter. The relative probability amplitudes for neighboring (i.e.,similar) universes, however, are important. The no-boundary condition impliesthat the probability amplitude is highest for histories in which the universestarts out completely smooth. The amplitude is reduced for universes that aremore irregular. This means that the early universe would have been almostsmooth, but with small irregularities. As we’ve noted, we can observe theseirregularities as small variations in the microwaves coming from differentdirections in the sky. They have been found to agree exactly with the generaldemands of inflation theory; however, more precise measurements are needed tofully differentiate the top-down theory from others, and to either support orrefute it. These may well be carried out by satellites in the future.Hundreds of years ago people thought the earth was unique, and situated at thecenter of the universe. Today we know there are hundreds of billions of stars inour galaxy, a large percentage of them with planetary systems, and hundreds ofbillions of galaxies. The results described in this chapter indicate that ouruniverse itself is also one of many, and that its apparent laws are not uniquelydetermined. This must be disappointing for those who hoped that an ultimatetheory, a theory of everything, would predict the nature of everyday physics. Wecannot predict discrete features such as the number of large space dimensions orthe internal space that determines the physical quantities we observe (e.g., themass and charge of the electron and other elementary particles). Rather, we usethose numbers to select which histories contribute to the Feynman sum.We seem to be at a critical point in the history of science, in which we mustalter our conception of goals and of what makes a physical theory acceptable. Itappears that the fundamental numbers, and even the form, of the apparent laws ofnature are not demanded by logic or physical principle. The parameters are freeto take on many values and the laws to take on any form that leads to aself-consistent mathematical theory, and they do take on different values anddifferent forms in different universes. That may not satisfy our human desire tobe special or to discover a neat package to contain all the laws of physics, butit does seem to be the way of nature.There seems to be a vast landscape of possible universes. However, as we’ll seein the next chapter, universes in which life like us can exist are rare. We livein one in which life is possible, but if the universe were only slightlydifferent, beings like us could not exist. What are we to make of thisfine-tuning? Is it evidence that the universe, after all, was designed by abenevolent creator? Or does science offer another explanation? [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_089_r1.jpg] [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_070_r1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_071_r1.jpg] [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_072_r1.jpg]HE CHINESE TELL OF A TIME during theHsia dynasty (ca. 2205—ca. 1782 BC) when our cosmic environment suddenlychanged. Ten suns appeared in the sky. The people on earth suffered greatly fromthe heat, so the emperor ordered a famous archer to shoot down the extra suns.The archer was rewarded with a pill that had the power to make him immortal, buthis wife stole it. For that offense she was banished to the moon.The Chinese were right to think that a solar system with ten suns is notfriendly to human life. Today we know that, while perhaps offering great tanningopportunities, any solar system with multiple suns would probably never allowlife to develop. The reasons are not quite as simple as the searing heatimagined in the Chinese legend. In fact, a planet could experience a pleasanttemperature while orbiting multiple stars, at least for a while. But uniformheating over long periods of time, a situation that seems necessary for life,would be unlikely. To understand why, let’s look at what happens in the simplesttype of multiple-star system, one with two suns, which is called a binarysystem. About half of all stars in the sky are members of such systems. But evensimple binary systems can maintain only certain kinds of stable orbits, of thetype shown below. In each of these orbits there would likely be a time in whichthe planet would be either too hot or too cold to sustain life. The situation iseven worse for clusters having many stars.Our solar system has other “lucky” properties without which sophisticatedlife-forms might never have evolved. For example, Newton’s laws allow forplanetary orbits to be either circles or ellipses (ellipses are squashedcircles, wider along one axis and narrower along another). The degree to whichan ellipse is squashed is described by what is called its eccentricity, a numberbetween zero and one. An eccentricity near zero means the figure resembles acircle, whereas an eccentricity near one means it is very flattened. Kepler wasupset by the idea that planets don’t move in perfect circles, but the earth’sorbit has an eccentricity of only about 2 percent, which means it is nearlycircular. As it turns out, that is a stroke of very good fortune.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_073_r1.jpg]Seasonal weather patterns on earth are determined mainly by the tilt of theearth’s axis of rotation relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun.During winter in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, the North Pole is tiltedaway from the sun. The fact that the earth is closest to the sun at thattime—only 91.5 million miles away, as opposed to around 94.5 million miles awayfrom the sun in early July—has a negligible effect on the temperature comparedwith the effect of its tilt. But on planets with a large orbital eccentricity,the varying distance from the sun plays a much larger role. On Mercury, forexample, with a 20 percent eccentricity, the temperature is over 200 degreesFahrenheit warmer at the planet’s closest approach to the sun (perihelion) thanwhen it is at its farthest from the sun (aphelion). In fact, if the eccentricityof the earth’s orbit were near one, our oceans would boil when we reached ournearest point to the sun, and freeze over when we reached our farthest, makingneither winter nor summer vacations very pleasant. Large orbital eccentricitiesare not conducive to life, so we are fortunate to have a planet for whichorbital eccentricity is near zero.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_074_r1.jpg]We are also lucky in the relationship of our sun’s mass to our distance from it.That is because a star’s mass determines the amount of energy it gives off. Thelargest stars have a mass about a hundred times that of our sun, while thesmallest are about a hundred times less massive. And yet, assuming the earth-sundistance as a given, if our sun were just 20 percent less or more massive, theearth would be colder than present-day Mars or hotter than present-day Venus.Traditionally, given any star, scientists define the habitable zone as thenarrow region around the star in which temperatures are such that liquid watercan exist. The habitable zone is sometimes called the “Goldilocks zone,” becausethe requirement that liquid water exist means that, like Goldilocks, thedevelopment of intelligent life requires that planetary temperatures be “justright.” The habitable zone in our solar system, pictured above, is tiny.Fortunately for those of us who are intelligent life-forms, the earth fellwithin it![images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_075_r1.jpg]Newton believed that our strangely habitable solar system did not “arise out ofchaos by the mere laws of nature.” Instead, he maintained, the order in theuniverse was “created by God at first and conserved by him to this Day in thesame state and condition.” It is easy to understand why one might think that.The many improbable occurrences that conspired to enable our existence, and ourworld’s human-friendly design, would indeed be puzzling if ours were the onlysolar system in the universe. But in 1992 came the first confirmed observationof a planet orbiting a star other than our sun. We now know of hundreds of suchplanets, and few doubt that there exist countless others among the many billionsof stars in our universe. That makes the coincidences of our planetaryconditions—the single sun, the lucky combination of earth-sun distance and solarmass—far less remarkable, and far less compelling as evidence that the earth wascarefully designed just to please us human beings. Planets of all sorts exist.Some—or at least one—support life. Obviously, when the beings on a planet thatsupports life examine the world around them, they are bound to find that theirenvironment satisfies the conditions they require to exist.It is possible to turn that last statement into a scientific principle: Our veryexistence imposes rules determining from where and at what time it is possiblefor us to observe the universe. That is, the fact of our being restricts thecharacteristics of the kind of environment in which we find ourselves. Thatprinciple is called the weak anthropic principle. (We’ll see shortly why theadjective “weak” is attached.) A better term than “anthropic principle” wouldhave been “selection principle,” because the principle refers to how our ownknowledge of our existence imposes rules that select, out of all the possibleenvironments, only those environments with the characteristics that allow life.Though it may sound like philosophy, the weak anthropic principle can be used tomake scientific predictions. For example, how old is the universe? As we’ll soonsee, for us to exist the universe must contain elements such as carbon, whichare produced by cooking lighter elements inside stars. The carbon must then bescattered through space in a supernova explosion, and eventually condense aspart of a planet in a new-generation solar system. In 1961 physicist RobertDicke argued that the process takes about 10 billion years, so our being heremeans that the universe must be at least that old. On the other hand, theuniverse cannot be much older than 10 billion years, since in the far future allthe fuel for stars will have been used up, and we require hot stars for oursustenance. Hence the universe must be about 10 billion years old. That is notan extremely precise prediction, but it is true—according to current data thebig bang occurred about 13.7 billion years ago.As was the case with the age of the universe, anthropic predictions usuallyproduce a range of values for a given physical parameter rather than pinpointingit precisely. That’s because our existence, while it might not require aparticular value of some physical parameter, often is dependent on suchparameters not varying too far from where we actually find them. We furthermoreexpect that the actual conditions in our world are typical within theanthropically allowed range. For example, if only modest orbital eccentricities,say between zero and 0.5, will allow life, then an eccentricity of 0.1 shouldnot surprise us because among all the planets in the universe, a fair percentageprobably have orbits with eccentricities that small. But if it turned out thatthe earth moved in a near-perfect circle, with eccentricity, say, of0.00000000001, that would make the earth a very special planet indeed, andmotivate us to try to explain why we find ourselves living in such an anomaloushome. That idea is sometimes called the principle of mediocrity.The lucky coincidences pertaining to the shape of planetary orbits, the mass ofthe sun, and so on are called environmental because they arise from theserendipity of our surroundings and not from a fluke in the fundamental laws ofnature. The age of the universe is also an environmental factor, since there arean earlier and a later time in the history of the universe, but we must live inthis era because it is the only era conducive to life. Environmentalcoincidences are easy to understand because ours is only one cosmic habitatamong many that exist in the universe, and we obviously must exist in a habitatthat supports life.The weak anthropic principle is not very controversial. But there is a strongerform that we will argue for here, although it is regarded with disdain amongsome physicists. The strong anthropic principle suggests that the fact that weexist imposes constraints not just on our environment but on the possible formand content of the laws of nature themselves. The idea arose because it is notonly the peculiar characteristics of our solar system that seem oddly conduciveto the development of human life but also the characteristics of our entireuniverse, and that is much more difficult to explain.The tale of how the primordial universe of hydrogen, helium, and a bit oflithium evolved to a universe harboring at least one world with intelligent lifelike us is a tale of many chapters. As we mentioned earlier, the forces ofnature had to be such that heavier elements—especially carbon—could be producedfrom the primordial elements, and remain stable for at least billions of years.Those heavy elements were formed in the furnaces we call stars, so the forcesfirst had to allow stars and galaxies to form. Those grew from the seeds of tinyinhomogeneities in the early universe, which was almost completely uniform butthankfully contained density variations of about 1 part in 100,000. However, theexistence of stars, and the existence inside those stars of the elements we aremade of, is not enough. The dynamics of the stars had to be such that some wouldeventually explode, and, moreover, explode precisely in a way that coulddisburse the heavier elements through space. In addition, the laws of nature hadto dictate that those remnants could recondense into a new generation of stars,these surrounded by planets incorporating the newly formed heavy elements. Justas certain events on early earth had to occur in order to allow us to develop,so too was each link of this chain necessary for our existence. But in the caseof the events resulting in the evolution of the universe, such developments weregoverned by the balance of the fundamental forces of nature, and it is thosewhose interplay had to be just right in order for us to exist.One of the first to recognize that this might involve a good measure ofserendipity was Fred Hoyle, in the 1950s. Hoyle believed that all chemicalelements had originally been formed from hydrogen, which he felt was the trueprimordial substance. Hydrogen has the simplest atomic nucleus, consisting ofjust one proton, either alone or in combination with one or two neutrons.(Different forms of hydrogen, or any nucleus, having the same number of protonsbut different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes.) Today we know thathelium and lithium, atoms whose nuclei contain two and three protons, were alsoprimordially synthesized, in much smaller amounts, when the universe was about200 seconds old. Life, on the other hand, depends on more complex elements.Carbon is the most important of these, the basis for all organic chemistry.Though one might imagine “living” organisms such as intelligent computersproduced from other elements, such as silicon, it is doubtful that life couldhave spontaneously evolved in the absence of carbon. The reasons for that aretechnical but have to do with the unique manner in which carbon bonds with otherelements. Carbon dioxide, for example, is gaseous at room temperature, andbiologically very useful. Since silicon is the element directly below carbon onthe periodic table, it has similar chemical properties. However, silicondioxide, quartz, is far more useful in a rock collection than in an organism’slungs. Still, perhaps life-forms could evolve that feast on silicon andrhythmically twirl their tails in pools of liquid ammonia. Even that type ofexotic life could not evolve from just the primordial elements, for thoseelements can form only two stable compounds, lithium hydride, which is acolorless crystalline solid, and hydrogen gas, neither of them a compound likelyto reproduce or even to fall in love. Also, the fact remains that we are acarbon life-form, and that raises the issue of how carbon, whose nucleuscontains six protons, and the other heavy elements in our bodies were created.The first step occurs when older stars start to accumulate helium, which isproduced when two hydrogen nuclei collide and fuse with each other. This fusionis how stars create the energy that warms us. Two helium atoms can in turncollide to form beryllium, an atom whose nucleus contains four protons. Onceberyllium is formed, it could in principle fuse with a third helium nucleus toform carbon. But that doesn’t happen, because the isotope of beryllium that isformed decays almost immediately back into helium nuclei.The situation changes when a star starts to run out of hydrogen. When thathappens the star’s core collapses until its central temperature rises to about100 million degrees Kelvin. Under those conditions, nuclei encounter each otherso often that some beryllium nuclei collide with a helium nucleus before theyhave had a chance to decay. Beryllium can then fuse with helium to form anisotope of carbon that is stable. But that carbon is still a long way fromforming ordered aggregates of chemical compounds of the type that can enjoy aglass of Bordeaux, juggle flaming bowling pins, or ask questions about theuniverse. For beings such as humans to exist, the carbon must be moved frominside the star to friendlier neighborhoods. That, as we’ve said, isaccomplished when the star, at the end of its life cycle, explodes as asupernova, expelling carbon and other heavy elements that later condense into aplanet.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_076_r1.jpg]This process of carbon creation is called the triple alpha process because“alpha particle” is another name for the nucleus of the isotope of heliuminvolved, and because the process requires that three of them (eventually) fusetogether. The usual physics predicts that the rate of carbon production via thetriple alpha process ought to be quite small. Noting this, in 1952 Hoylepredicted that the sum of the energies of a beryllium nucleus and a heliumnucleus must be almost exactly the energy of a certain quantum state of theisotope of carbon formed, a situation called a resonance, which greatlyincreases the rate of a nuclear reaction. At the time, no such energy level wasknown, but based on Hoyle’s suggestion, William Fowler at Caltech sought andfound it, providing important support for Hoyle’s views on how complex nucleiwere created.Hoyle wrote, “I do not believe that any scientist who examined the evidencewould fail to draw the inference that the laws of nuclear physics have beendeliberately designed with regard to the consequences they produce inside thestars.” At the time no one knew enough nuclear physics to understand themagnitude of the serendipity that resulted in these exact physical laws. But ininvestigating the validity of the strong anthropic principle, in recent yearsphysicists began asking themselves what the universe would have been like if thelaws of nature were different. Today we can create computer models that tell ushow the rate of the triple alpha reaction depends upon the strength of thefundamental forces of nature. Such calculations show that a change of as littleas 0.5 percent in the strength of the strong nuclear force, or 4 percent in theelectric force, would destroy either nearly all carbon or all oxygen in everystar, and hence the possibility of life as we know it. Change those rules of ouruniverse just a bit, and the conditions for our existence disappear!By examining the model universes we generate when the theories of physics arealtered in certain ways, one can study the effect of changes to physical law ina methodical manner. It turns out that it is not only the strengths of thestrong nuclear force and the electromagnetic force that are made to order forour existence. Most of the fundamental constants in our theories appearfine-tuned in the sense that if they were altered by only modest amounts, theuniverse would be qualitatively different, and in many cases unsuitable for thedevelopment of life. For example, if the other nuclear force, the weak force,were much weaker, in the early universe all the hydrogen in the cosmos wouldhave turned to helium, and hence there would be no normal stars; if it were muchstronger, exploding supernovas would not eject their outer envelopes, and hencewould fail to seed interstellar space with the heavy elements planets require tofoster life. If protons were 0.2 percent heavier, they would decay intoneutrons, destabilizing atoms. If the sum of the masses of the types of quarkthat make up a proton were changed by as little as 10 percent, there would befar fewer of the stable atomic nuclei of which we are made; in fact, the summedquark masses seem roughly optimized for the existence of the largest number ofstable nuclei.If one assumes that a few hundred million years in stable orbit are necessaryfor planetary life to evolve, the number of space dimensions is also fixed byour existence. That is because, according to the laws of gravity, it is only inthree dimensions that stable elliptical orbits are possible. Circular orbits arepossible in other dimensions, but those, as Newton feared, are unstable. In anybut three dimensions even a small disturbance, such as that produced by the pullof the other planets, would send a planet off its circular orbit and cause it tospiral either into or away from the sun, so we would either burn up or freeze.Also, in more than three dimensions the gravitational force between two bodieswould decrease more rapidly than it does in three dimensions. In threedimensions the gravitational force drops to ¼ of its value if one doubles thedistance. In four dimensions it would drop to ⅛, in five dimensions it woulddrop to [images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_090_r1.jpg] and so on. As a result, inmore than three dimensions the sun would not be able to exist in a stable statewith its internal pressure balancing the pull of gravity. It would either fallapart or collapse to form a black hole, either of which could ruin your day. Onthe atomic scale, the electrical forces would behave in the same way asgravitational forces. That means the electrons in atoms would either escape orspiral into the nucleus. In neither case would atoms as we know them bepossible.The emergence of the complex structures capable of supporting intelligentobservers seems to be very fragile. The laws of nature form a system that isextremely fine-tuned, and very little in physical law can be altered withoutdestroying the possibility of the development of life as we know it. Were it notfor a series of startling coincidences in the precise details of physical law,it seems, humans and similar life-forms would never have come into being.The most impressive fine-tuning coincidence involves the so-called cosmologicalconstant in Einstein’s equations of general relativity. As we’ve said, in 1915,when he formulated the theory, Einstein believed that the universe was static,that is, neither expanding nor contracting. Since all matter attracts othermatter, he introduced into his theory a new antigravity force to combat thetendency of the universe to collapse onto itself. This force, unlike otherforces, did not come from any particular source but was built into the veryfabric of space-time. The cosmological constant describes the strength of thatforce.When it was discovered that the universe was not static, Einstein eliminated thecosmological constant from his theory and called including it the greatestblunder of his life. But in 1998 observations of very distant supernovasrevealed that the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, an effect thatis not possible without some kind of repulsive force acting throughout space.The cosmological constant was resurrected. Since we now know that its value isnot zero, the question remains, why does it have the value that it does?Physicists have created arguments explaining how it might arise due to quantummechanical effects, but the value they calculate is about 120 orders ofmagnitude (a 1 followed by 120 zeroes) stronger than the actual value, obtainedthrough the supernova observations. That means that either the reasoningemployed in the calculation was wrong or else some other effect exists thatmiraculously cancels all but an unimaginably tiny fraction of the numbercalculated. The one thing that is certain is that if the value of thecosmological constant were much larger than it is, our universe would have blownitself apart before galaxies could form and—once again—life as we know it wouldbe impossible.What can we make of these coincidences? Luck in the precise form and nature offundamental physical law is a different kind of luck from the luck we find inenvironmental factors. It cannot be so easily explained, and has far deeperphysical and philosophical implications. Our universe and its laws appear tohave a design that both is tailor-made to support us and, if we are to exist,leaves little room for alteration. That is not easily explained, and raises thenatural question of why it is that way.Many people would like us to use these coincidences as evidence of the work ofGod. The idea that the universe was designed to accommodate mankind appears intheologies and mythologies dating from thousands of years ago right up to thepresent. In the Mayan Popol Vuh mythohistorical narratives the gods proclaim,“We shall receive neither glory nor honor from all that we have created andformed until human beings exist, endowed with sentience.” A typical Egyptiantext dated 2000 BC states, “Men, the cattle of God, have been well provided for.He [the sun god] made the sky and earth for their benefit.” In China the Taoistphilosopher Lieh Yü-K’ou (c. 400 BC) expressed the idea through a character in atale who says, “Heaven makes the five kinds of grain to grow, and brings forththe finny and the feathered tribes, especially for our benefit.”In Western culture the Old Testament contains the idea of providential design inits story of creation, but the traditional Christian viewpoint was also greatlyinfluenced by Aristotle, who believed “in an intelligent natural world thatfunctions according to some deliberate design.” The medieval Christiantheologian Thomas Aquinas employed Aristotle’s ideas about the order in natureto argue for the existence of God. In the eighteenth century another Christiantheologian went so far as to say that rabbits have white tails in order that itbe easy for us to shoot them. A more modern illustration of the Christian viewwas given a few years ago when Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, archbishop ofVienna, wrote, “Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, faced with scientificclaims like neo-Darwinism and the multiverse [many universes] hypothesis incosmology invented to avoid the overwhelming evidence for purpose and designfound in modern science, the Catholic Church will again defend human nature byproclaiming that the immanent design in nature is real.” In cosmology theoverwhelming evidence for purpose and design to which the cardinal was referringis the fine-tuning of physical law we described above.The turning point in the scientific rejection of a human-centered universe wasthe Copernican model of the solar system, in which the earth no longer held acentral position. Ironically, Copernicus’s own worldview was anthropomorphic,even to the extent that he comforts us by pointing out that, despite hisheliocentric model, the earth is almost at the universe’s center: “Although [theearth] is not at the center of the world, nevertheless the distance [to thatcenter] is as nothing in particular when compared to that of the fixed stars.”With the invention of the telescope, observations in the seventeenth century,such as the fact that ours is not the only planet orbited by a moon, lent weightto the principle that we hold no privileged position in the universe. In theensuing centuries the more we discovered about the universe, the more it seemedours was probably just a garden-variety planet. But the discovery relativelyrecently of the extreme fine-tuning of so many of the laws of nature could leadat least some of us some back to the old idea that this grand design is the workof some grand designer. In the United States, because the Constitution prohibitsthe teaching of religion in schools, that type of idea is called intelligentdesign, with the unstated but implied understanding that the designer is God.That is not the answer of modern science. We saw in Chapter 5[Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c005_r1.htm] that our universe seems to be one of many,each with different laws. That multiverse idea is not a notion invented toaccount for the miracle of fine-tuning. It is a consequence of the no-boundarycondition as well as many other theories of modern cosmology. But if it is true,then the strong anthropic principle can be considered effectively equivalent tothe weak one, putting the fine-tunings of physical law on the same footing asthe environmental factors, for it means that our cosmic habitat—now the entireobservable universe—is only one of many, just as our solar system is one ofmany. That means that in the same way that the environmental coincidences of oursolar system were rendered unremarkable by the realization that billions of suchsystems exist, the fine-tunings in the laws of nature can be explained by theexistence of multiple universes. Many people through the ages have attributed toGod the beauty and complexity of nature that in their time seemed to have noscientific explanation. But just as Darwin and Wallace explained how theapparently miraculous design of living forms could appear without interventionby a supreme being, the multiverse concept can explain the fine-tuning ofphysical law without the need for a benevolent creator who made the universe forour benefit.Einstein once posed to his assistant Ernst Straus the question “Did God have anychoice when he created the universe?” In the late sixteenth century Kepler wasconvinced that God had created the universe according to some perfectmathematical principle. Newton showed that the same laws that apply in theheavens apply on earth, and developed mathematical equations to express thoselaws that were so elegant they inspired almost religious fervor among manyeighteenth-century scientists, who seemed intent on using them to show that Godwas a mathematician.Ever since Newton, and especially since Einstein, the goal of physics has beento find simple mathematical principles of the kind Kepler envisioned, and withthem to create a unified theory of everything that would account for everydetail of the matter and forces we observe in nature. In the late nineteenth andearly twentieth century Maxwell and Einstein united the theories of electricity,magnetism, and light. In the 1970s the standard model was created, a singletheory of the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force.String theory and M-theory then came into being in an attempt to include theremaining force, gravity. The goal was to find not just a single theory thatexplains all the forces but also one that explains the fundamental numbers wehave been talking about, such as the strength of the forces and the masses andcharges of the elementary particles. As Einstein put it, the hope was to be ableto say that “nature is so constituted that it is possible logically to lay downsuch strongly determined laws that within these laws only rationally completelydetermined constants occur (not constants, therefore, whose numerical valuecould be changed without destroying the theory).” A unique theory would beunlikely to have the fine-tuning that allows us to exist. But if in light ofrecent advances we interpret Einstein’s dream to be that of a unique theory thatexplains this and other universes, with their whole spectrum of different laws,then M-theory could be that theory. But is M-theory unique, or demanded by anysimple logical principle? Can we answer the question, why M-theory?

At first theexistence of such laws became apparent only in astronomy (or astrology, whichwas regarded as much the same). The behavior of things on earth is socomplicated and subject to so many influences that early civilizations wereunable to discern any clear patterns or laws governing these phenomena.Gradually, however, new laws were discovered in areas other than astronomy, andthis led to the idea of scientific determinism: There must be a complete set oflaws that, given the state of the universe at a specific time, would specify howthe universe would develop from that time forward. These laws should holdeverywhere and at all times; otherwise they wouldn’t be laws. There could be noexceptions or miracles. Gods or demons couldn’t intervene in the running of theuniverse.At the time that scientific determinism was first proposed, Newton’s laws ofmotion and gravity were the only laws known. We have described how these lawswere extended by Einstein in his general theory of relativity, and how otherlaws were discovered to govern other aspects of the universe.The laws of nature tell us how the universe behaves, but they don’t answer thewhy? questions that we posed at the start of this book:Why is there something rather than nothing?Why do we exist?Why this particular set of laws and not some other?Some would claim the answer to these questions is that there is a God who choseto create the universe that way. It is reasonable to ask who or what created theuniverse, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflectedto that of who created God. In this view it is accepted that some entity existsthat needs no creator, and that entity is called God. This is known as thefirst-cause argument for the existence of God. We claim, however, that it ispossible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, andwithout invoking any divine beings.According to the idea of model-dependent realism introduced in Chapter 3[Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c003_r1.htm], our brains interpret the input from oursensory organs by making a model of the outside world. We form mental conceptsof our home, trees, other people, the electricity that flows from wall sockets,atoms, molecules, and other universes. These mental concepts are the onlyreality we can know. There is no model-independent test of reality. It followsthat a well-constructed model creates a reality of its own. An example that canhelp us think about issues of reality and creation is the Game of Life, inventedin 1970 by a young mathematician at Cambridge named John Conway.The word “game” in the Game of Life is a misleading term. There are no winnersand losers; in fact, there are no players. The Game of Life is not really a gamebut a set of laws that govern a two-dimensional universe. It is a deterministicuniverse: Once you set up a starting configuration, or initial condition, thelaws determine what happens in the future.The world Conway envisioned is a square array, like a chessboard, but extendinginfinitely in all directions. Each square can be in one of two states: alive(shown in green) or dead (shown in black). Each square has eight neighbors: theup, down, left, and right neighbors and four diagonal neighbors. Time in thisworld is not continuous but moves forward in discrete steps. Given anyarrangement of dead and live squares, the number of live neighbors determinewhat happens next according to the following laws: 1. A live square with two or three live neighbors survives (survival). 2. A dead square with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (birth). 3. In all other cases a cell dies or remains dead. In the case that a live square has zero or one neighbor, it is said to die of loneliness; if it has more than three neighbors, it is said to die of overcrowding. That’s all there is to it: Given any initial condition, these laws generategeneration after generation. An isolated living square or two adjacent livesquares die in the next generation because they don’t have enough neighbors.Three live squares along a diagonal live a bit longer. After the first time stepthe end squares die, leaving just the middle square, which dies in the followinggeneration. Any diagonal line of squares “evaporates” in just this manner. Butif three live squares are placed horizontally in a row, again the center has twoneighbors and survives while the two end squares die, but in this case the cellsjust above and below the center cell experience a birth. The row therefore turnsinto a column. Similarly, the next generation the column back turns into a row,and so forth. Such oscillating configurations are called blinkers.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_080_r1.jpg]If three live squares are placed in the shape of an L, a new behavior occurs. Inthe next generation the square cradled by the L will give birth, leading to a 2× 2 block. The block belongs to a pattern type called the still life because itwill pass from generation to generation unaltered. Many types of patterns existthat morph in the early generations but soon turn into a still life, or die, orreturn to their original form and then repeat the process.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_081_r1.jpg]There are also patterns called gliders, which morph into other shapes and, aftera few generations, return to their original form, but in a position one squaredown along the diagonal. If you watch these develop over time, they appear tocrawl along the array. When these gliders collide, curious behaviors can occur,depending on each glider’s shape at the moment of collision.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_082_r1.jpg]What makes this universe interesting is that although the fundamental “physics”of this universe is simple, the “chemistry” can be complicated. That is,composite objects exist on different scales. At the smallest scale, thefundamental physics tells us that there are just live and dead squares. On alarger scale, there are gliders, blinkers, and still-life blocks. At a stilllarger scale there are even more complex objects, such as glider guns:stationary patterns that periodically give birth to new gliders that leave thenest and stream down the diagonal.If you observed the Game of Life universe for a while on any particular scale,you could deduce laws governing the objects on that scale. For example, on thescale of objects just a few squares across you might have laws such as “Blocksnever move,” “Gliders move diagonally,” and various laws for what happens whenobjects collide. You could create an entire physics on any level of compositeobjects. The laws would entail entities and concepts that have no place amongthe original laws. For example, there are no concepts such as “collide” or“move” in the original laws. Those describe merely the life and death ofindividual stationary squares. As in our universe, in the Game of Life yourreality depends on the model you employ.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_083_r1.jpg]Conway and his students created this world because they wanted to know if auniverse with fundamental rules as simple as the ones they defined could containobjects complex enough to replicate. In the Game of Life world, do compositeobjects exist that, after merely following the laws of that world for somegenerations, will spawn others of their kind? Not only were Conway and hisstudents able to demonstrate that this is possible, but they even showed thatsuch an object would be, in a sense, intelligent! What do we mean by that? To beprecise, they showed that the huge conglomerations of squares thatself-replicate are “universal Turing machines.” For our purposes that means thatfor any calculation a computer in our physical world can in principle carry out,if the machine were fed the appropriate input—that is, supplied the appropriateGame of Life world environment—then some generations later the machine would bein a state from which an output could be read that would correspond to theresult of that computer calculation.[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_084_r1.jpg]To get a taste for how that works, consider what happens when gliders are shotat a simple 2 × 2 block of live squares. If the gliders approach in just theright way, the block, which had been stationary, will move toward or away fromthe source of the gliders. In this way, the block can simulate a computermemory. In fact, all the basic functions of a modern computer, such as AND andOR gates, can also be created from gliders. In this manner, just as electricalsignals are employed in a physical computer, streams of gliders can be employedto send and process information.In the Game of Life, as in our world, self-reproducing patterns are complexobjects. One estimate, based on the earlier work of mathematician John vonNeumann, places the minimum size of a self-replicating pattern in the Game ofLife at ten trillion squares—roughly the number of molecules in a single humancell.One can define living beings as complex systems of limited size that are stableand that reproduce themselves. The objects described above satisfy thereproduction condition but are probably not stable: A small disturbance fromoutside would probably wreck the delicate mechanism. However, it is easy toimagine that slightly more complicated laws would allow complex systems with allthe attributes of life. Imagine a entity of that type, an object in aConway-type world. Such an object would respond to environmental stimuli, andhence appear to make decisions. Would such life be aware of itself? Would it beself-conscious? This is a question on which opinion is sharply divided. Somepeople claim that self-awareness is something unique to humans. It gives themfree will, the ability to choose between different courses of action.How can one tell if a being has free will? If one encounters an alien, how canone tell if it is just a robot or it has a mind of its own? The behavior of arobot would be completely determined, unlike that of a being with free will.Thus one could in principle detect a robot as a being whose actions can bepredicted. As we said in Chapter 2 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c002_r1.htm], thismay be impossibly difficult if the being is large and complex. We cannot evensolve exactly the equations for three or more particles interacting with eachother. Since an alien the size of a human would contain about a thousandtrillion trillion particles even if the alien were a robot, it would beimpossible to solve the equations and predict what it would do. We wouldtherefore have to say that any complex being has free will—not as a fundamentalfeature, but as an effective theory, an admission of our inability to do thecalculations that would enable us to predict its actions.The example of Conway’s Game of Life shows that even a very simple set of lawscan produce complex features similar to those of intelligent life. There must bemany sets of laws with this property. What picks out the fundamental laws (asopposed to the apparent laws) that govern our universe? As in Conway’s universe,the laws of our universe determine the evolution of the system, given the stateat any one time. In Conway’s world we are the creators—we choose the initialstate of the universe by specifying objects and their positions at the start ofthe game.In a physical universe, the counterparts of objects such as gliders in the Gameof Life are isolated bodies of matter. Any set of laws that describes acontinuous world such as our own will have a concept of energy, which is aconserved quantity, meaning it doesn’t change in time. The energy of empty spacewill be a constant, independent of both time and position. One can subtract outthis constant vacuum energy by measuring the energy of any volume of spacerelative to that of the same volume of empty space, so we may as well call theconstant zero. One requirement any law of nature must satisfy is that itdictates that the energy of an isolated body surrounded by empty space ispositive, which means that one has to do work to assemble the body. That’sbecause if the energy of an isolated body were negative, it could be created ina state of motion so that its negative energy was exactly balanced by thepositive energy due to its motion. If that were true, there would be no reasonthat bodies could not appear anywhere and everywhere. Empty space wouldtherefore be unstable. But if it costs energy to create an isolated body, suchinstability cannot happen, because, as we’ve said, the energy of the universemust remain constant. That is what it takes to make the universe locallystable—to make it so that things don’t just appear everywhere from nothing.If the total energy of the universe must always remain zero, and it costs energyto create a body, how can a whole universe be created from nothing? That is whythere must be a law like gravity. Because gravity is attractive, gravitationalenergy is negative: One has to do work to separate a gravitationally boundsystem, such as the earth and moon. This negative energy can balance thepositive energy needed to create matter, but it’s not quite that simple. Thenegative gravitational energy of the earth, for example, is less than abillionth of the positive energy of the matter particles the earth is made of. Abody such as a star will have more negative gravitational energy, and thesmaller it is (the closer the different parts of it are to each other), thegreater this negative gravitational energy will be. But before it can becomegreater than the positive energy of the matter, the star will collapse to ablack hole, and black holes have positive energy. That’s why empty space isstable. Bodies such as stars or black holes cannot just appear out of nothing.But a whole universe can.Because gravity shapes space and time, it allows space-time to be locally stablebut globally unstable. On the scale of the entire universe, the positive energyof the matter can be balanced by the negative gravitational energy, and so thereis no restriction on the creation of whole universes. Because there is a lawlike gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing in the mannerdescribed in Chapter 6 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c006_r1.htm]. Spontaneouscreation is the reason there is something rather than nothing, why the universeexists, why we exist. It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touchpaper and set the universe going.Why are the fundamental laws as we have described them? The ultimate theory mustbe consistent and must predict finite results for quantities that we canmeasure. We’ve seen that there must be a law like gravity, and we saw in Chapter5 [Hawk_9780553907070_epub_c005_r1.htm] that for a theory of gravity to predictfinite quantities, the theory must have what is called supersymmetry between theforces of nature and the matter on which they act. M-theory is the most generalsupersymmetric theory of gravity. For these reasons M-theory is the onlycandidate for a complete theory of the universe. If it is finite—and this hasyet to be proved—it will be a model of a universe that creates itself. We mustbe part of this universe, because there is no other consistent model.M-theory is the unified theory Einstein was hoping to find. The fact that wehuman beings—who are ourselves mere collections of fundamental particles ofnature—have been able to come this close to an understanding of the lawsgoverning us and our universe is a great triumph. But perhaps the true miracleis that abstract considerations of logic lead to a unique theory that predictsand describes a vast universe full of the amazing variety that we see. If thetheory is confirmed by observation, it will be the successful conclusion of asearch going back more than 3,000 years. We will have found the grand design."},{"pageContent":"[images/Hawk_9780553907070_epub_085_r1.jpg]Alternative histories • a formulation of quantum theory in which the probabilityof any observation is constructed from all the possible histories that couldhave led to that observation.Anthropic principle • the idea that we can draw conclusions about the apparentlaws of physics based on the fact that we exist.Antimatter • each particle of matter has a corresponding anti-particle.
