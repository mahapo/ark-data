Without plants we would not be able to live; they have always been intimately linked to life on Earth. Thanks to photosynthesis, plants provide us with food, medicines, wood, resins, and oxygen, among other things. Discovering plants' processes for converting sunlight into carbohydrates such as sugars and starches is almost magical. It is marvelous to understand how an organism that cannot move learned to maximize the energy that it receives from the Sun, as well as to discover the mechanisms that enable it to face so many different environmental challenges. Some leaves have essential adaptations, such as thick skin, thorns, or fleshy stalks, which allow them to survive in very dry environments. Others, such as the tomato plant, form certain proteins when temperatures drop in order to protect themselves from damage caused by freezing. Green Revolution RICE CROP Rice is synonymous with food security in much of Asia. It is also a staple food in western Africa, the Caribbean, and the tropical regions of Latin America. You may be surprised to learn why plants invest so much energy and effort into producing flowers. In this book we will describe for you in detail, step by step, how fertilization takes place. Did you know that pollination is aided by the wind and insects and that some flowers can be pollinated only by a certain species of insect? You will find all this and much more in the pages of this book, which includes spectacular images and illustrations that give an inside view of the core of a tree and even show the functions of its tissues and the veins of its leaves. W hat were the first plants to conquer the Earth like, and how did they help convert bare rock into soil? What happened next, and which species evolved and spread worldwide during the Carboniferous Period? A complete historical overview of plants is included in this book, as is an explanation of the radical differences between plants, algae, and fungi—the latter two of which are now considered to be more closely related to animals than to plants. Although the place of plants in the human diet is nothing new, the search for other beneficial uses of plants is a more modern development. Crops— such as rice, corn, wheat, rye, barley, oats, soy, lentils, and chickpeas—are grown worldwide as sources of proteins, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients necessary for our bodies to function, and they also provide people with an important source of income."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Background A ccording to scientific evidence, the nearest relatives of plants are algae that lived on the shores of lagoons. Later, from these ha b itats, which were at times dry and at times damp, the first land plants emerged. Most had to adapt in order to prosper in a different environment. Such adaptation ena b led them to achieve amazing growth, as exemplified b y the giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum) , which can measure 260 feet (80 m) tall and 100 feet (30 m) in circumference at its b ase.

Their most outstanding feature is the presen- ce of chloroplasts with chlorophyll, a pigment that enables them to transform solar energy into chemical energy. They use this energy to pro- duce their food. Plants need to attach themselves to a substrate (usually the ground), from which they can extract water and nutrients. This attachment, however, also keeps them from moving from place to place. Algae and fungi were once included in the plant kingdom, but they are now considered to be separate from plants and to belong to the kingdoms Protista and Fungi, respectively. Kingdoms of the Quiet Life Algae are commonly considered water plants, but this is not the case. Algae have neither roots nor stalks. Because they live in the water (freshwater or salt water), they need no substrate. Some are microscopic, but large algae formations can be found in the ocean. Algae are classified into families depending on their color. Together green algae and plants make up the group of organisms called the “green line,” whose members are characterized by having chloroplasts and by storing grains of starch in the cytoplasm as a reserve. Plants The plant kingdom (Plantae) includes organisms whose characteristics include the presence of the pigment chlorophyll to convert solar energy into chemical energy for producing food from water and carbon dioxide. This ability is called autotrophy. All plants, whether large or small, play an extremely important role in providing food for all other living beings. Plants cannot move from place to place, but their gametes, spores (cells that separate from a plant and can germinate), and seeds can move about, especially with the help of water and wind. Fungi belong to a different kingdom from that of plants. Fungi, unlike plants, do not carry out photosynthesis, and they store energy in the form of glycogen rather than starch. Fungi are heterotrophic (they get their food from other organisms), and they take in food by absorption. Fungi can be either parasitic or feed on dead organic material. Some fungi are microscopic; others are large and conspicuous. Their bodies are composed of a mycelium, a mass of filaments called hyphae. Some fungi also have a fruit-bearing structure. SPIKE MOSS has scalelike leaves, some of which are clustered in the form of a spike. FERNS are the most diverse group of seedless plants. Their origin dates back to the Devonian Period. PSILOPHYTA are extremely simple plants; they lack roots and true leaves, but they have a stalk with veins. HORSETAIL RUSHES have roots, stems, and true leaves. The leaves are small and encircle the stems. CEREALS are monocotyledons. Their seeds have only one cotyledon (embryonic leaf), and their mature leaves have parallel veins. ORCHIDS have many petals; their number of petals is always a multiple of three. This makes them, along with cereal grains, monocotyledons (monocots). 8 BACKGROUND Gymnosperma The Greek word means “naked seed.” Gymnosperms are vascular plants with exposed seeds and no flowers. Ginkgos (Ginkgophyta) and cycads (Cycadophyta) were the most common plant groups in ancient times. Today conifers (such as pines, larches, cypresses, and firs) are the most common type. Conifers are monoicous—that is, the same plant has both male and female sexual organs—and their seeds are held between the scales of a structure called a cone. CYCADS are tropical plants that look like palm trees. Their reproduction is similar to that of pine trees, but they are dioecious (each plant has flowers of only one sex). GINKGOS Only one species is left in this group, which is the oldest genus of living trees. GNETOPHYTA Plants with naked seeds and a vascular system similar to that of angiosperms FERN Osmunda sp. MOSS Sphagnum sp. RED MARINE ALGA Rhodomela sp. Seedless Ferns are the most common seedless plants today. Many are thought to have originated during the Devonian Period and reached their greatest splendor in the Carboniferous Period. Their tissues are simpler than those of plants with seeds, and their green stems have a large surface area, giving them a great capacity for photosynthesis. Ferns need water so that they can reproduce by means of spores. The spores are produced in spore cases called sporangia, which grow on leaves called sporophylls. Bryophytes include mosses and worts. Mosses have rhizoids rather than roots. They can also absorb water through their entire body surface. Bryophytes lack a means of surviving long periods of drought. When dry periods come, bryophytes enter a latent state. Because they have no system of veins for transporting nutrients, they can barely grow beyond 0.4 inch (1 cm) long. In order to reproduce they need to be near liquid water. ORCHID Cattleya trianae SITKA SPRUCE Picea sitchensis WHITE MUSHROOM Agaricus bisporus WHEAT Triticum sp.

Their reproductive structures are called cones. Most conifers are evergreens. Angiosperms have seeds, flowers, and fruit. They include more than 250,000 species and are adapted to nearly all environments except for Antarctica. They reproduce sexually by producing flowers that later form fruits with seeds. Angiosperms have an efficient vascular system for transporting water (through the xylem) and food (through the phloem). Angiosperms make up a division of the plant kingdom that includes plants with bright flowers; grains, such as rice and wheat; other crops, such as cotton, tobacco, and coffee; and trees, such as oak, cherry, and chestnut."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Rooted Plants with Floating Leaves Such plants are often found in standing or slow-moving water. They have fixed rhizomes and petiolate leaves (leaves with a stalk that connects to a stem) that float on the surface of the water. Some of the plants have submerged leaves, some have floating leaves, and some have leaves outside the water, with each type having a different shape. In the case of floating leaves the properties of the upper surface are different from those of the lower surface, which is in contact with the water. Rooted Underwater Plants The entire plant is submerged. The small root system serves only to anchor the plant since the stem can directly absorb water, carbon dioxide, and minerals. These plants are often found in flowing water. The submerged stems have no system of support—the water holds up the plant. Amphibious or Wetland Plants These species live on the edges of ponds, rivers, and swamps. They are also found in salt marshes, which are periodically flooded by tides or river overflows. These plants are a transition between aquatic and land plants. Their limiting factor is the availability of oxygen, so they have well-developed aerenchyma. Submerged or Free Some underwater plants are free, without roots, but with developed stalks and divided leaves. Other floating plants have a rosette shape and leaves modified for floating; they have well-developed roots with root caps but without absorbent hairs. The roots help the plant to stay balanced on top of the water. Floating Leaves The rhizomes are fixed, the leaves grow on long stalks, and the leaf surface floats on the water. Upper Epidermis Lower Epidermis Conduction Bundle Aquatic but Modern The evolutionary history of plants began in water environments. They later conquered land by means of structures such as roots. Modern aquatic plants are not a primitive group, however. On the contrary, they have returned to the water environment by acquiring highly specialized organs and tissues. For example, some tissues have air pockets that enable the plant to float. A Vital Role Aquatic plants play an important role in the ecosystem not only for crustaceans, insects, and worms but also for fish, birds, and mammals because they are an important source of food and shelter for these categories of animals. Aquatic plants also play a major role in converting solar energy into the organic materials upon which many living things depend.

ARROWHEAD Sagittaria sagittifolia Its flowers, with three white petals and purple stamens, form during the summer. CATTAILS Typha sp. grow in moist soil, around lake margins, and in marshes in both temperate and tropical climates. YELLOW FLOATING HEART Nymphoides peltata It produces small creased yellow flowers all summer long. HORNWORT Ceratophyllum sp. This plant has an abundance of fine leaves that form a conelike structure on each stem. The roots and rhizomes under the water are well developed. They produce and release oxygen as a result of photosynthesis. Submerged stems have no support system because the water holds up the plant. Their limiting factor is oxygen availability, so the aerenchyma helps make this substance available to the plant. The underwater parts do not have an impermeable outer layer, so they can absorb minerals and gases directly from the water. Aquatic plant with especially beautiful flowers. 10 BACKGROUND T hese plants are especially adapted for living in ponds, streams, lakes, and rivers—places where other land plants cannot grow. Although aquatic plants belong to many different families, they have similar adaptations and are therefore an example of adaptive convergence. They include submerged plants and floating plants; plants that may or may not be rooted at the bottom; amphibious plants, which have leaves both above and below the water's surface; and heliophilic plants, which have only their roots underwater. SAGO PONDWEED Potamogeton densus This water plant can be found in shallow depressions of clear-flowing streams. Aerenchyma is always found in floating organisms. This tissue has an extensive system of intercellular spaces through which gases are diffused. Pneumatophores are floating roots that are involved in air exchange. They take oxygen from the surface, and it circulates to the rest of the plant through its intracellular spaces. They probably also allow carbon dioxide to escape. Certain plants have a special adaptation that consists of air sacs that store oxygen for periods when the plant will be submerged or that speed up the plant's transpiration."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Grasses take advantage of long hours of summer daylight to grow and reproduce. Their stalks do not have reinforcing tissues that would enable them to remain erect. Giants Trees are distinguished by their woody trunks. As a tree grows from a tender shoot, it develops a tissue that gives it strength, enabling it to grow over 330 feet (100 m) tall. Trees are found in the principal terrestrial ecosystems. Epiphytes grow on plants or on some other supporting surface. Their anatomy includes secondary adaptations that enable them to live without being in contact with the soil. Conquest of Land 12 BACKGROUND T he movement of plants from shallow water onto land is associated with a series of evolutionary events. Certain changes in the genetic makeup of plants enabled them to face the new and extreme conditions found on the Earth's surface. Although land habitats offered plants direct exposure to sunlight, they also presented the problem of transpiration and the loss of water that it produces. This difficulty had to be overcome before plants could spread over land. MOSS Sphagnum sp. Bryophytes are the simplest of all land plants. MALE FERN Dryopteris filix-mas These vascular plants need liquid water to reproduce. SWEET VIOLET Viola odorata This plant's spring flowers have a pleasant scent. STEMLESS SOW THISTLE Sonchus acaulis These plants lack a stem. Vital Changes Roots are among the most important adaptations for plants' success in land habitats. Root systems anchor the plant in the substrate and serve as a pathway for water and mineral nutrients to enter it. Besides roots, the development of a cuticle (skin membrane) to cover the entire plant's surface was crucial. Cells in the epidermis produce this waterproof membrane, which helps the plant tolerate the heat generated by sunlight and the wear and loss of water caused by the wind. This protection is interrupted by pores, which allow for gas exchange. Green Revolution Leaves are the main organs for photosynthesis in land plants. After plants appeared on land more than 440 million years ago, the amount of photosynthesis taking place gradually increased. This increase is believed to be one of the reasons the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere decreased. As a result, the Earth's average temperature also decreased.

It is known for its lobed leaves and the large cap of its acorn, a nut found on all trees of the genus Quercus . The tree's main trunk grows upward and branches out toward the top. Oaks are a large group, containing many types of deciduous trees. Under optimal conditions oaks can grow to a height of more than 130 feet (40 m) and live an average of 600 years. Roots grow sideways to form a deep, broad root system. Buds are formed by protective scales that fall off in the spring. They grow into new leaves and branches. Trunk The trunk is strong and grows straight upward. The top of the tree widens with branches, which may be twisted, knotted, or bent. Flowers The tree produces hanging male flowers, whereas female flowers are hidden among the leaves. Bark Leaves are arranged one leaf to a stem on alternating sides of the twig. They have rounded lobes on either side of the main vein. Acorns have dark stripes along their length. Their caps have flat scales. Seeds Some species have sweet- tasting seeds; others are bitter. Beginnings In its first year of life an oak tree's roots can grow nearly 5 feet (1.5 m). Achene: A hard seed that does not split open at maturity Remains of the Carpel (female reproductive part) Autumn The cells at the end of each leaf stem weaken. Summer The leaves undertake photosynthesis, and the rest of the tree uses the sugars it produces. Winter The leaf falls away, and the tree remains dormant. Spring The cycle begins as the first leaves appear. Autumn Low temperatures weaken the branches. Winter The leaves fall away; the tree is dormant until spring. Spring New leaves begin to replace the old ones. The leaves absorb CO 2 and produce sugars by means of photosynthesis. Transpiration (the loss of water vapor) in the leaves pulls the xylem sap upward. THE AVERAGE LIFE SPAN OF AN OAK 600 years Climate Trees grow in any place where there is sufficient water in the soil. Energy Source The chlorophyll traps energy from sunlight and uses it to convert water and carbon dioxide into food. Surface Mosses use the bark of oak trees as a source of moisture. Summer The oak blossoms. It increases in height, and its trunk grows thicker. Woodpeckers drill holes in the tree with their beaks as they look for insects.

Absorption of Water and Minerals The phloem transports sugars from the leaves to the rest of the tree."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Feeding on Light 16 BACKGROUND Stages of the Process Photosynthesis takes place in two stages. The first, called photosystem II, depends directly on the amount of light received, which causes the chlorophyll to release electrons. The resulting gaps are filled by electrons of water, which breaks down and releases oxygen and ionized hydrogen (2H+). ATP formation is powered by the movement of electrons into receptor molecules in a chain of oxidation and reduction reactions. 1 In photosystem I light energy is absorbed, sending electrons into other receptors and making NADPH out of NADP +. 2 In photosystem I ATP is also generated from ADP because of the surplus flow of free electrons. 4 The ATP and NADPH obtained are the net gain of the system, in addition to oxygen. Two water molecules are split apart in the process, but one is regenerated when the ATP is formed. 3 Car b on THE BUILDING BLOCK OF ORGANIC MATERIALS Thylakoids Sacs that contain chlorophyll molecules. Inside them ADP is converted into ATP as a product of the light-dependent phase of photosynthesis. Stacked thylakoids form a structure called a grana. The Dark Phase This phase, so called because it does not directly depend on light, takes place inside the stroma of the chloroplast. Energy in the form of ATP and NADPH, which was produced in the light-dependent phase, is used to fix carbon dioxide as organic carbon through a process called the Calvin cycle. This cycle consists of chemical reactions that produce phosphoacylglycerides, which the plant cell uses to synthesize nutrients. Cell Membrane Cell Wall Nucleus Grana Nucleole Vacuole provides water and pressure and gives the cell consistency. Plant Cells have three traits that differentiate them from animal cells: cell walls (which are made up of 40 percent cellulose), a large vacuole containing water and trace mineral elements, and chloroplasts containing chlorophyll. Like an animal cell, a plant cell has a nucleus. Why Green? Leaves absorb energy from visible light, which consists of different colors. The leaves reflect only the green light. Leaves are made of several types of plant tissues. Some serve as a support, and some serve as filler material. Algae perform photosynthesis underwater. Together with water plants, they provide most of the atmosphere's oxygen. OXYGEN is a by-product of photosynthesis. It exits the surface of the leaves through their stoma (two-celled pores). WATER Photosynthesis requires a constant supply of water, which reaches the leaves through the plant's roots and stem. CARBON DIOXIDE is absorbed by plant cells to form sugars by means of photosynthesis. Plant Tissues The relative stiffness of plant cells is provided by cellulose, the polysaccharide formed by the plant's cell walls. This substance is made of thousands of glucose units, and it is very difficult to hydrolyze (break down in water).

This process, called photosynthesis, takes place in chloroplasts, cellular components that contain the necessary enzyme machinery to transform solar energy into chemical energy. Each plant cell can have between 20 and 100 oval-shaped chloroplasts. Chloroplasts can reproduce themselves, suggesting that they were once autonomous organisms that established a symbiosis, which produced the first plant cell.

Algae grow on the sea floor or on the surface of rocks in the ocean, in rivers, and in lakes. Their shape and color are extremely varied. The annual world harvest of algae is estimated at more than 1 million tons in dry weight. Asian countries (Japan and China) produce 80 percent of the world's harvest.

Most have the ability to ingest solid material through phagocytosis. Single-celled algae include some distinctive groups. Diatoms are covered with a protective shell made of silicon. Some single-celled algae, namely red algae, can thrive at relatively high temperatures. Red algae is unique among eukaryote organisms in its ability to live inside thermal water vents. Single-Celled Organisms This group of algae includes multicelled structures. They form colonies with mobile, single-celled algae that group together more or less regularly in a shared mucilaginous capsule. They can also appear in threadlike shapes, which branch off, or in bulky shapes, which are made up of layers of cells with a particular degree of cellular differentiation, that together are called a thallus. Multicelled Organisms 6,000 DIFFERENT SPECIES have been classified within this group of green algae, or chlorophytes. PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 21 20 FROM ALGAE TO FERNS Colors of Life A lgae are living things that manufacture their own food using photosynthesis. Their color is related to this process, and it has been used as a way of classifying them. They are also grouped according to the number of cells they have. There are many kinds of one-celled algae. Some algae form colonies, and others have multicellular bodies. Some types of brown seaweed can reach a length of more than 150 feet (45 m).

When they find an area with light and the nutrients necessary for development, they use asexual reproduction to multiply and colonize the area. Phaeophytes are the 1,500 species of brown seaweed. They inhabit temperate regions and the rocky coasts of the coldest seas on Earth. Their color comes from the pigment fucoxanthin, a xanthophyll that masks the green color of their chlorophyll. 1 Chlorophytes constitute the group of green algae. The majority of species are microscopic, single- celled organisms with flagella. Others form into filaments, and yet others form large multicellular bodies. The group Ulvophyceae includes sea lettuce, which resembles a leaf of lettuce and is edible. The group Charophyceae includes stoneworts, which contain calcium carbonate deposits. The chlorophytes are linked evolutionally with plants because they contain the same forms of chlorophyll, and their cell walls contain cellulose. 2 Rhodophytes are characterized by their phycoerythrin pigments, which give the algae a reddish color by masking their chlorophyll's green color. Most rhodophytes grow below the intertidal zone near tropical and subtropical coasts. They are distributed throughout the principal oceans of the world and grow mainly in shaded areas in warm, calm water. 3"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"22 FROM ALGAE TO FERNS PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 23 How Algae Reproduce T he reproduction of algae can be sexual or asexual in alternating phases, depending on the species and on environmental conditions. Vegetative multiplication occurs through fragmentation or through the production of spores. In sexual reproduction the fertilization of the gametes (sexual cells) produces a zygote that will give rise to a new alga. During asexual reproduction there is no genetic exchange, and the algae produced are clones of the original. Sexual reproduction, in contrast, produces algae with new characteristics that may help them to better adapt to their environment. Sporophytes generate spores in every species of microscopic algae. New individuals born from these spores are called gametophytes, and they produce gametes, which can be male, female, or hermaphrodite. During fertilization the male gametes (antheridia) and the female ones (ovum) form a cell called a zygote, which develops into a new thallus when it grows. Gametocytes and sporophytes can vary in morphology. If they are similar, they are called isomorphic, and if they are different, they are called heteromorphic. Sexual JOURNEY Once they become detached, antherozoids use their flagella to move in the water. FEMALE FUCUS The receptacles secrete a greenish gelatin made up of female gametes. The gametes are freed when the sac that contains them breaks. APPROACH The journey of the antherozoids coincides with the opening of the female gametangia. ANOTHER CYCLE The youthful thallus, when mature, produces spores. Asexual reproduction does not involve fertilization. It can take place in either of two ways. In fragmentation, segments of an alga become detached from its body, and, since the alga does not have any specialized organs, the segments continue to grow as long as environmental conditions remain favorable. The other form of asexual reproduction is by means of spores, special cells that form from a normal cell. Some algae spores have one or more filaments, or flagella, that allow the alga to swim freely. When the appropriate environmental conditions are found, the spores germinate into new algae. Asexual Transverse cut from a Fucus species thallus MALE FUCUS The male fucus has receptacles in which antheridia form. New Thallus After fertilization the zygote divides and creates the embryo, a small cell mass that attaches to rocks, where a new thallus of Fucus species grows. The thallus looks similar to the stem of plants, and it contains blades that look like leaves. Fertilization Both fertilization and asexual reproduction are the natural means of perpetuation for this species. Algae form new individuals similar to themselves through reproduction. When an antherozoid penetrates the ovum, it fertilizes the egg and forms a zygote. 2 3 Antheridium The male gametangia (structure that produces gametes). They produce antherozoids, which have two flagellae and are smaller than the ovum, or female gamete. They swim until they reach an ovum and then surround it. 1 Ovum In the reproductive stage female gametangia form at the tips of the thalluses. This is where the female sexual cells (ova) develop. 1 OPENING The sac that contains the ovum opens.

The majority live in the ocean, and most of those remaining live in freshwater. 1 Depth Marine algae live where sunlight can reach them. Sunlight is completely absorbed at a depth of 650 to 1,300 feet (200–400 m). Green and brown algae are usually found near the shore; they also live in stagnant terrestrial bodies of water. Green, brown, and red algae can appear farther from shore in deeper waters, and red algae live in even deeper waters. Each area represents a specific type of habitat, with a characteristic composition of flora and fauna. 2 Concentration of Salts The waters that cover the Earth's surface are classified into two types: salt water, which forms the oceans and seas, and freshwater, or continental water. Marine water has a concentration of dissolved salts that is generally considered to be uniform. In contrast, the salt concentration of continental water can vary from place to place, causing it to have a different effect on living organisms. 3 Water Temperature Temperature, which varies according to latitude and marine currents, plays an important role in determining where algae can live. The energy that the Sun's radiation provides to the oceans varies with its angle of incidence, but currents and tides distribute this energy. Ocean temperature is also dependent on depth—as the depth increases, the temperature decreases. PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 25 24 FROM ALGAE TO FERNS Terrestrial and Marine Algae A s long as there is water, the survival of an alga is assured. Algae are found both in the oceans and in freshwater, but not all can survive in both environments. Depth, temperature, and salt concentrations of water are characteristics that determine whether algae can live in a given area. Algae can be green, brown, or red. Of the three, red algae are found in the deepest waters. Some species of algae can live outside of water, but they are nevertheless found in humid places, such as in mud or on stone walls or rocks.

FILTERING The noxious residues are eliminated. Then the algae are filtered and transported to a tank. BASINS can withstand high temperatures. In the last basin the mass is cooked at 212° F (100° C). GELLING occurs when the temperature is lowered along the length of the pipe to 77° F (25° C). PRECAUTION The dried algae must be ground immediately to prevent it from becoming moist. FILTER 1.5 TONS PER DAY The amount of Gelidium algae extractd by hand in Japan. MILLING The dry ground agar is milled to reduce particle size. I n China algae have been used for food, as well as for traditional medicine, for thousands of years. However, the algae industry began on a broad scale in the 17th century in Japan with the production of caustic soda and potassium hydroxide from the ashes of brown algae. A century later Western countries began to exploit algae in order to extract iodine and other chemical compounds of great economic value, such as phycocolloids (gelatin-like substances that can be obtained from several species of algae). The most commonly used phycocolloids are agar, carrageenan, and algin. How Agar Is Obtained Most algae collection is still done by hand, although commonly used large species, such as the Caribbean Sargasso, are also collected with special boats in which processing of the algae can begin. The first stages, especially drying, are typically carried out by natural methods, but large fire-heated drying drums are used in some countries of Europe and North America. Although the use of heated drums is more expensive, it can result in a product of higher quality. DRYING prevents the algae from rotting. Algae are first washed with seawater. ALGAE BUNDLE If the algae are dried properly, they can be stored for years. START The algae are given an alkaline pH. WASHING They are washed with water; then acid is added.

DRYING PRESS DRYING BELT GRINDING MOIST GEL GELLING PRESS 26 FROM ALGAE TO FERNS Alkalinization After the dry bundles are gathered, the algae are transported to an alkaline treatment pond. There sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is added, and the mixture is heated to a temperature of 176° F (80° C). The mixture is then washed and hydrated with cold water. Washing and Bleaching After the alkaline treatment algae pass through a process in which they are washed with cold water. To ensure an even processing, compressed air is bubbled through the water. Later sodium hypochlorite is added to bleach the algae. Some sulfuric acid can be added to this mixture to regulate acidity. 2 Drying Gel sheets about 0.4 inch (1 cm) wide come out of the press between layers of nylon. They are placed on platforms, where they begin to dry. The sheets are then placed on a conveyor belt and further dried by a stream of hot air. 4 Transformation An initial filtering step uses only water and a filtering soil. The mixture must be kept in continuous motion and injected with steam to prevent it from separating. The mixture then passes through stainless steel pipes in which it is cooled to obtain a gelatin that contains 1 percent agar. 3 A World of Uses Algae extracts are used in the manufacture of food products, medicines, cosmetics, medical supplies, and even tools. They can serve as emulsifying, stabilizing, thickening, or clarifying agents. Algae extracts are used in ice cream pie fillings, puddings, and salad dressings. They are also used for making molds in dentistry, for lubrication in drawing wire, and as a medium for culturing bacteria. 1 The Algae Industry Dulse Palmaria sp.

Alga Cell 1 The spore of the fungus encounters the alga. 2 The spore grows around the alga, and the alga reproduces. They form a new organism (thallus of the lichen). 3 L ichens are the result of a close relationship between fungi and algae (usually green algae). Although they are most common in cold areas, they adapt easily to diverse climatic conditions. Lichens can grow in the Arctic glacial regions, as well as in deserts and volcanic regions. They live on rocks, from which they obtain all the necessary minerals to live, and they contribute to the formation of soils. Lichens are excellent indicators of the level of environmental pollution, since elevated levels of pollution cause them to die. A Symbiotic Relationship Lichens are the result of symbiosis between a fungus and an alga, a relationship from which both benefit. In a lichen the fungus offers the alga support and moisture and protects it from heat and dehydration. Likewise, the alga produces food for itself and for the fungus through photosynthesis. Where They Live Lichens grow in cold regions, as well as in the Amazon Rainforest and the desert. They are very sensitive to environmental pollution.

Ovule Spermatozoids SPECIES OF MOSSES have been classified within the bryophite group of nonvascular plants. 10,000 Meiosis Meiosis is a type of cellular division in which each daughter cell receives only one complete set of chromosomes. Therefore, the resulting cells have half as many chromosomes as the parent cells had. In general, this mechanism generates the gametes, but mosses generate haploid spores in the capsule of the sporophyte. Capsule Calyptra Perichaetium Stalk Operculum Rhizoid M osses were among the earliest plants to emerge. They evolved from green algae more than 250 million years ago and belong to the group of simple plants called bryophytes. Mosses reproduce only in environments where liquid water is present. Because they grow in groups, they take on the appearance of a green carpet. These primitive plants can serve as indicators of air pollution, and they help reduce environmental degradation. Mosses Small Plants Mosses are bryophytes. They are relatively small plants that affix themselves to a substratum via rhizoids and carry out photosynthesis in small “leaves” that lack the specialized tissues of the real leaves of vascular plants. They fulfill a very important ecological role: they participate in the formation of soils by decomposing the rocks on which they grow, and they contribute to the photosynthesis of epiphytes in rainforests. Their asexual reproduction occurs through fragmentation or the production of propagula. Operculum A type of cap that covers the opening of the capsule and normally separates when the spores exit Mature Sporophyte consists of a capsule in which spores are formed. SPORES The life cycle of a moss begins with the freeing of the spores that form in the capsule, which opens when a cap called the operculum is expulsed. ADULT GAMETOPHYTE This is what a grown gametophyte looks like. GERMINATION OF THE SPORE The spore germinates and gives rise to a filamentous protonema (cellular mass). DEVELOPMENT OF THE SPOROPHYTE The zygote divides through mitosis and forms the sporophyte, which remains united to the gametophyte. ZYGOTE It forms from the union of two sexual cells in a watery environment. ADULT SPOROPHYTE The adult sporophyte consists of a capsule (within which the spores form), a stalk (which holds the capsule), and a foot. GAMETOPHYTE DEVELOPMENT The gametophyte grows. HORIZONTAL FILAMENTS The gametophyte develops from the horizontal filaments. Rhizoids Archegonium: the female sexual organ Antheridium: the male sexual organ DIPLOID Diploid cells have two sets of chromosomes. Consequently, they have duplicate genetic information. HAPLOID A haploid cell is one that contains only one complete set of genetic information. Reproductive cells, such as the ova and sperm in mammals, are haploid, but the rest of the cells in the body of higher organisms are usually diploid—that is, they have two complete sets of chromosomes. In fertilization two haploid gametes unite to form a diploid cell. In the case of mosses all the cells of the gametophyte, the gametes, and the spores are haploid. Annulus Capsule contains the spores and is found at the tip. Sporophyte Gametophyte Fertilization Reproductive organs that produce gametes develop in the green gametophytes, which live all year long. When there is sufficient moisture, the male gamete reaches a female gamete and fertilizes it. The zygote that arises from this union grows and forms the sporophyte. The sporophyte possesses fertile tissue that undergoes meiosis to generate spores that, after falling to the ground and germinating, will form a new gametophyte. The Cycle of Life Mosses do not have flowers, seeds, or fruits. As with other plants, mosses have a life cycle formed by alternating generations; however, in contrast with vascular plants, the haploid gametophyte is larger than the diploid sporophyte. Their biological cycle begins with the release of spores, which form in a capsule that opens when a small cap called the operculum is ejected. The spores germinate and give rise to a filamentous protonema (cellular mass) from which the gametophyte develops. The zygote that forms from the union of the two sexual cells develops into the sporophyte. 0.2 inch (5 mm) SPOROPHYTE The sporophyte does not have an independent existence but lives at the expense of the gametophyte. The sporophyte lives a short time and only during a certain time of the year.

Ferns have inhabited the surface of the Earth for 400 million years. Their leaves have structures called sori that contain the sporangium, which houses the spores. When the sori dry up, they release the spores into the air. Once on the ground, the spores germinate as gametophytes. In times of rain and abundant moisture the male cells of the gametophyte are able to swim to reach female gametes, which they fertilize to form a zygote that will grow as a sporophyte.

Seeds, To and Fro 36 SEED PLANTS 1 Awakening of the Seed Seeds, such as those of the field, or corn, poppy (Papaver rhoeas) , leave their latent stage when they hydrate and receive enough light and air. Their protective coverings open and the embryo grows thanks to the energy provided by its cotyledons, or seed leaves. 2 Tropism Because of gravity, amyloplasts are always located in the lower part of cells. They produce a stimulus that encourages the root to grow toward the earth, a process called geotropism. WATER is responsible for breaking open seed covers because the hydrated tissues exert pressure on the interior of the seed.

The root has many fine hairs that create a large surface area for water absorption. SESSILE LEAVES The upper leaves have no petiole. FLOWERING Internal and external changes stimulate the apical bud to develop a flower. Vegetative Growth The first true leaves unfold above the cotyledons, and the stem elongates from formative tissue called the meristem, located at the apex of the plant. Continued growth will lead to the formation of an adult plant, which will develop its own reproductive structures.

APICAL GROWTH Light stimulates the multiplication of cells in the apex of the stem. Cotyledons can remain under the soil or, as in this case, grow above the ground. 3 4 5 Growth The seedling grows and breaks through the surface. This causes the plant to be exposed to light so it can begin to carry out photosynthesis. It thus begins to manufacture its own nutrients to replace those provided by the cotyledons. Production of the Flower's Parts The apical bud begins to produce fertile flower structures (gynoecium and androecium) and sterile structures (petals and sepals). The flower bud forms. SECONDARY ROOTS THE FIRST 20 DAYS OF A FIELD POPPY Endosperm Enzymes Gibberellin Nutrients Seed Cover Embryo Gibberellins are plant hormones that, during the first stages of germination following water absorption, are distributed through the endosperm.

The primary root originates in the radicle of the embryo. An adventitious root is one that originates in any other organ of the plant. Roots are also subdivided according to their morphology. WATER enters through the root hairs and travels to the epidermal cells. NUTRIENTS depend on the quantity of nutrients in the soil and on the roots' ability to transport them. ROOT STRUCTURE The root cap is found at one end. While the root grows, the root cap protects it from soil abrasion. The interior of the root is formed by the cortex, which has a compact layer of cells that affect the flow of water through the root. This is due to the presence of a waxy substance that forms the Casparian strip.

Water penetrates into the roots when it has a greater concentration in the soil than in the intracellular environment of the root. L The root is a plant organ that is usually found under the soil. It has positive geotropism; its main functions are absorbing water and inorganic nutrients and attaching the plant to the ground. The root is essential for identifying the particular characteristics of a plant. The anatomical structure of a root can vary, but, because it does not have leaves or nodes, it will always be simpler than that of a stem. Under the Earth 40 SEED PLANTS Dicotyledon A plant that has seeds with two embryonic leaves (cotyledons). It has a tap root, and the leaves are usually petiolated with a reticulated vein distribution. Their internal organization consists of open conducting vessels in a circular arrangement. Monocotyledons These plants have embryos with only one cotyledon. Their embryonic root generally has a relatively short life and is replaced by adventitious roots that grow from the stem. GEOTROPISM Geotropism, or gravitotropism, is the growth of a plant or parts of a plant in a particular direction because of the stimulus of gravity. The force of gravity orients the stems and their leaves to grow upward (negative geotropism), whereas the roots grow downward (positive geotropism).

Some stems have cells with chlorophyll that carry out photosynthesis; others have specialized cells for storing starch and other nutrients. ARTICHOKE THISTLE Cynara cardunculus Stems have widely varying sizes and shapes that reflect different adaptations to the environment. Palm trees and wheat are two good examples that show how different mediums can modify the stem through evolution. Palm trees are the tallest non-woody plants. They grow tall because they must compete with many other plants for sunlight. In contrast, wheat is typical of areas with a cold climate and a short growing season. It develops a relatively short stem. This enables it to survive the physical assault of the dry wind and the loss of leaves. S tems, which occur in a variety of shapes and colors, support a plant's leaves and flowers. They keep it from breaking apart in the wind, and they determine its height. In addition, stems are also responsible for distributing the water and minerals absorbed by a plant's roots. Stems contain conducting vessels through which water and nutrients circulate.

Each new ring is different from the ring that grew the year before. This happens because the wood produced over the course of a year varies in its composition and in the time it takes to form a ring. Trees are the largest producers of wood, which can be processed as hand-cut wood, logs, or sawed lumber—the most common form in the industry. To calculate a tree's age scientists study its growth rings. A Tree's Age Dendrochronology is the study of the age of trees. The number of growth rings formed since a tree's birth establishes its age. INNER BARK is the youngest ring, because a new ring is created in each year's growth.

The wood of conifers (gymnosperms) tends to be simpler and more uniform than that of angiosperms. The woody tissue consists mainly of tracheids."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Branching Growth buds can be found at the end of the main axis (apical bud) or at the joint where the leaves meet the stem (lateral bud). Growth can take different forms, depending on the type of bud that predominates. If apical buds are more common, the branch growth is called monopodial. If lateral buds predominate, the branch growth is called sympodial. Conifers are an example of monopodial growth. Sympodial growth is widespread among dicotyledon herbs and is found in practically all monocotyledons. Lateral Buds These buds occur on the side of the stem; typically, only one is located in the stem joint. In some cases many lateral buds are arranged in a series around a column (serial buds). They can also be arranged around the same crosswise line along the branch or stem (collateral buds). APICAL BUD The apical meristem is derived from the embryo and causes the stem to grow longer. In seed-bearing plants (division Spermatophyta) a group of meristematic cells divides along different planes, increasing the length of the stem. SHOOTS OF AXILLARY BUDS GROWTH ZONE LEAF SHOOTS When the bracts open, these small leaves expand. MAIN AXIS contains small, compressed nodes and internodes.

GUM ROCKROSE Citus ladanifer Arrangement of Leaves Arrangement of Leaves PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 47 S ome vascular (veined) plants, also called tracheophytes, are able to continue growing year after year. This is made possible by meristems, groups of stem cells that retain the ability to divide. There are two types of meristems: apical, which carry on the plant's primary growth, and lateral, which give rise to the tissues that increase the plant's girth. As the meristematic cells form new cells, the plant grows and renews its organs. Thanks to their growth buds, the plants maintain their vitality and strengthen their organs or replace them often. Because of this process, the renewed plants are able to increase their number of branches, flowers, and leaves. Growth Springs Eternal 46 SEED PLANTS BRACTS Protective leaves that contain gummy substances, which keep the bud from drying out STEM APEX Apical buds can remain dormant for long periods of time. With the right physiological and environmental conditions, they can awaken and unfold. The bracts have a scaly appearance. NEW LEAVES unfold, and growth again occurs in the growth zone. PROPHYLLS The first leaves to form Without Bracts Some buds, such as those in plants of the cabbage family (Brassicaceae), are not covered by bracts. Instead, the vegetable's growth zone is covered by outer leaves. INFRAPETIOLAR BUD The axillary bud is joined to the petiole of a leaf. The growth of the leaf carries the bud outward. This often occurs in plants with inflorescences, or flowers that grow on branches. SUPERPOSED BUD The axillary bud is joined to the stem. As the cells of the internode multiply, they carry the axillary bud, which then appears to be inserted above the leaf. OPPOSITE Two leaves per node.

This genus includes trees and bushes easily distinguishable by their opposite and lobed leaves. 48 SEED PLANTS VEINS Flowering plants (division Angiosperma) are often distinguished by the type of veins they have: parallel veins in monocots and branching veins in dicots. TENDRILS The leaves of climbing plants, such as the grapevine, have these adaptive modifications. CONIFERS Needle-shaped leaves are characteristic of conifers. They are usually oval or triangular. A hypodermis, which is enclosed by the epidermis, is broken only in the stomas. Change and Its Advantages Conifers possess an interesting modification in their leaves. In these gymnosperms evolution directed the abrupt reduction of surface foliage area. This gave them an adaptive advantage over plants whose leaves have a large surface area: less resistance to wind and less transpiration in arid climates. In addition, they are able to avoid the excessive weight that would result from the accumulation of snow on large leaves. CROSS-SECTION In general, upon sectioning a leaf, one can observe that it possesses the same tissues as the rest of the body of the plant. The distribution of tissues varies with each species. PLANTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT The flow of carbon dioxide and water vapor between the plant and the environment is essential for the photosynthetic process. This exchange can be affected by internal or external factors, such as changes in light, temperature, or humidity. In response to these stimuli the stomas can open or close. Simple Leaves In most monocotyledon plants the leaf is undivided. In some cases it may have lobes or notches in its side, but these divisions do not reach all the way to the primary vein of the leaf. Compound Leaves When the leaf is divided from the primary vein, it forms separate leaflets. A compound leaf is called palmate when the leaflets are arranged like the fingers on a hand and pinnate when they grow from the sides of the leaf stem like the barbs of a feather. T he main function of leaves is to carry out photosynthesis. Their shape is specialized to capture light energy and transform it into chemical energy. Their thinness minimizes their volume and maximizes their surface area that is exposed to the Sun. However, there are a great many variations on this basic theme, which have evolved in association with different types of weather conditions. EDGES (MARGINS) Species are distinguished by a wide variety of edges: smooth, jagged, and wavy. LEAF STEM (PETIOLE) RACHIS CONDUCTING TISSUE is made of live cells (phloem) and dead cells (xylem). BASIC TISSUE is formed by live cells that give structure to the leaf and usually contain some chloroplasts. EPIDERMAL TISSUE is composed of live cells. It surrounds all the parts of the leaf and the plant. It produces a substance that forms the cuticle. PRIMARY VEINS The products of photosynthesis circulate through the veins from the leaves to the rest of the body.

Many are hermaphroditic, meaning that they contain both the male reproductive apparatus (the androecium) and the female (the gynoecium). The process of pollination is carried out through external agents, such as insects, birds, wind, and water. Following fertilization, flowers produce seeds in their ovaries. The floral parts are arranged in circular or spiral patterns. Whorls Most flowers have four whorls. In a typical flower the outermost whorl is the calyx, followed by the corolla, the androecium (which can have two parts), and the gynoecium. When a flower has all four whorls, it is considered complete; it is incomplete when it lacks at least one of them. Plants that have an androecium and a gynoecium, but in separate flowers, are called monoecious. If the flower lacks a sepal and petals, it is said to be naked. Classification Plants with flowers are classified as dicotyledons or monocotyledons. The first group has seeds with two cotyledons, and the second has seeds with only one. Each represents a different evolutionary line. They are differentiated by the structure of their organs. The cotyledon contains nutrients that the embryo utilizes during its growth until its true leaves appear. When a seed germinates, the first thing that appears is the root. In monocotyledons the stem and the radicle are protected by a membrane; the dicotyledons lack this protection, and the stem pushes itself through the soil. Dicotyledons In this class of plants each whorl of the flower is arranged in groups of four or five parts. In dicotyledons the sepal is small and green, the petals are large and colorful, and the leaves are wide. The vascular ducts are cylindrical. Monocotyledons Each whorl of these flowers contains three parts, and their sepals and petals are generally not differentiated from one another. The majority are herbaceous plants with scattered vascular conduits. They are the most evolved species of angiosperms. COROLLA A grouping of petals. If its parts are separated, they are simply called petals; if they are united, the plant is described as gamopetalous. CALYX The grouping of sepals that protects the other parts of the flower. Together with the corolla it forms the perianth. The sepals may be separate or united; in the latter case the plant is called gamosepalous. OVARY The ovary is found in the receptacle in the base of the gynoecium, inside the carpels. The pollen tube, which conducts the pollen to the ovule, extends to the ovary. Androecium The male reproductive system. It is formed by a group of stamens, each of which consists of an anther supported by a filament. The base may contain glands that produce nectar. STIGMA It can be simple or divided. It secretes a sticky liquid that captures the pollen. Some are also covered with hair. Gynoecium The female reproductive system. It is formed by carpels and includes the ovary, ovules, style, and stigma. ROOT In monocotyledons all the roots branch from the same point, forming a kind of dense hair. They are generally superficial and short-lived. ROOT In dicotyledons the main root penetrates the ground vertically as a prolongation of the stem, and secondary roots extend from it horizontally. It can be very deep and long-lived. LEAVES In dicotyledons, leaves have various forms, and they contain a network of veins that connect with a primary vein. CARPEL The carpel consists of modified leaves that together form the gynoecium. It contains a stigma, a style, and an ovary. Ovules are produced in the ovary. STYLE Some styles are solid, others hollow. Their number depends on the number of carpels. The pollen tube grows through the style. In corn the tube can reach a length of 15 inches (40 cm). SEPAL Each of the modified leaves that protect the flower in its first stage of development. They also prevent insects from gaining access to the nectar without completing their pollinating function. Sepals are usually green. TEPAL In monocotyledonous plants the petals and sepals are usually the same. In this case they are called tepals, and the group of tepals is called a perianth. FLORAL DIAGRAM FLORAL DIAGRAM OVARY The ovary is found in the receptacle at the base of the gynoecium, inside the carpels. The pollen tube extends into the ovary and penetrates the ovule.

However, in the case of a nut, its hard “peel” is its endocarp. Section A sac that fills with juices (reserves of water and sugar) produced by the ovary walls POMES are fleshy fruits that come from epigynous flowers, or flowers whose enclosed ovaries lie below the place where the other parts of the flower are attached.

Through the fossil record it is known that conifers have existed for more than 390 million years. Their leaves are usually needle-shaped and perennial. They are woody plants that reproduce by means of seeds that contain tissues and an embryo that grows until it becomes an adult plant. Conifers Good Wood The great majority of conifers are evergreens, although some, such as larches (tamarac), are deciduous. Conifers are the tallest and most long-lived trees, and they provide most of the wood used in industry. Most conifers form new shoots during the summer. They produce a resinous substance that protects them from freezing during winter. This adaptation permits vital nutrients to continue to circulate through their vascular systems, even in very cold weather. 56 SEED PLANTS MATURE CONE Three years after the cone appears, its seeds are ready to disseminate. LEAVES Grouped in sets of two, they have elongated shapes. They carry out photosynthesis. CONES The male and female cones are generally not located on the same branch. FEMALE CONE Small and light, it is likely to be pollinated as soon as it appears. YOUNG LEAVES are covered by a protective capsule. Pine Cones The female cone contains ovules that are situated among its ovuliferous scales. The cones are woody and are usually found in the upper branches of the tree. The male cones are not woody and are usually found in the lower branches. When the ovules of a female cone are pollinated, the resulting seeds need about three years to mature inside the cone. Mature ovules are popularly called pine nuts. DISPERSION The ovuliferous scales generate a greenish gelatin containing the female gametes. The gametes are freed when the sac that contains them opens.

It produces a nectar that attracts flies. Reaching the leaf is usually fatal for the visiting insect because it sets off a series of physiological reactions in the plant that transform it into a deadly trap. Even larger insects, such as the dragonfly, can be trapped by these carnivorous plants. Upon contact by its prey, a very specific reaction takes place. Hairs detect the presence of the insect and stimulate the closure of the leaves. However, a Venus flytrap's leaves do not react to other types of contact, such as the impact of raindrops. Main Menu: Insects There are distinct orders of dicotyledons that include carnivorous plants, such as Nepenthales, Sarraceniales, and Scrophulariales. These plants include the pitcher plant, sundews, and bladderworts. 60 RARE AND USEFUL PLANTS 2 No Exit The fold of the leaf stimulates the lateral thorns on its opposite sides to interlace like the fingers of two hands and create a type of cage. This process occurs in two tenths of a second, so the fly has little chance of avoiding being trapped. DETECTOR HAIRS are sensitive to contact with insects. LOWER PART OF THE LEAF The cells have a great number of chloroplasts. 1 Falling into the Trap The fly positions itself above the trap and brushes the lateral thorns. This stimulus provokes the swollen cells of the hinge to lose water rapidly, which in turn causes the upper part of the leaf to close. If the insect is slow to react or move as the trap begins to close, it will be unable to escape. A Varied Diet Trappers belong to the group of autotrophic organisms—that is, they can produce organic material to use as food from simple inorganic substances. Carnivorous plants live in environments poor in nutrients. The insects that they trap permit them to make up for this deficiency. CARNIVOROUS PLANTS DIONEA MUSCIPULA Flytraps are cultivated all over the world. They are grown in slightly acidic soils, such as peat. They flourish if they have many insects to consume. UTRICULA VULGARIS These aquatic carnivores are of the family Lentibulariaceae. Their leaves are oval vesicles that open and close to trap microscopic animals. DROSERA CAPENSIS Their ribbonlike leaves are covered in sticky hairs. When the leaves receive a stimulus, they roll up and enclose the prey. DARLINGTONIA SP. Unlike other carnivorous pitcher plants in which the pitcher (trap) is attached to a stalk, this plant's pitcher grows directly from the soil. SARRACENIA SP. These plants are passive traps that use nectar to attract insects. Full of hairs, the pitchers retain the prey and keep it from escaping. NEPENTHES MIRABILIS The cover of its leaf-pitcher prevents water from entering. These plants tend to have very showy colors that are a fatal visual attraction to an insect. Dionaea muscipula Scientific name of the Venus flytrap. It is native to the eastern United States. LATERAL THORNS are the hardened borders of the leaves, which have a thick cuticle. UPPER PART OF THE LEAF Reniform, or kidney- shaped, it has special cells arranged along a central hinge. 3 Digestion In less than three minutes the trap has completely closed, and the digestion of the prey's tissue begins. Special glands located in the interior part of the upper leaf secrete acids and enzymes that chemically degrade the soft parts of the insect's body. When the leaf-trap reopens after a few weeks, the wind blows away the parts of the exoskeleton that were not digested. 1/5 second THE TIME NECESSARY FOR THE UPPER PART OF THE LEAF TO CLOSE AFTER A FLY LANDS ON IT. T hese carnivorous plants are the most exotic in the entire plant kingdom. Their name is associated with their ability to capture insects and digest them. What do they get from these tiny animals? They get substances rich in nitrogen, which is usually absent from the soil where they grow.

Their hard leaves can capture water and nutrients from the air. Using a sticky substance, they usually attach themselves to the branches of trees, where they can have access to sunlight. These traits make it possible for the them to subsist in their natural environment. Special Leaves The best-known function of these plants' leaves is to absorb water. In addition, at night they incorporate carbon dioxide and fix it into organic acids. This strategy diminishes their water loss through transpiration during the day through the opening of the stomas for gas exchange. When sunlight is available, photosynthesis takes places. The plants are able to manufacture carbohydrates without opening their stomas, because they can use the carbon dioxide that they took in during the night. These plants are recognized for their bulbs, which have the shape of a small rose, and for their triangular leaves, which are densely covered by hairs.

These parasites do not contain chlorophyll, and their leaves appear as small scales. Dodder germinates on the ground. It then grows around the stalk of a host plant and inserts small rootlike projections, called haustoria, into the stalk. As dodder grows, its many filamentous stems can look like spaghetti. Dodder kills herbaceous plants and debilitates woody ones. It is usually considered a pest because of the economic losses it produces in fodder plants such as alfalfa. Deadly Embrace The genus Ficus has some lethal plants among its members. The epiphyte species of the genus, during its young stage, can strangulate and kill the tree on which it supports itself. In this way it can reach the sunlight, which is typically scarce on the forest floor. For example, the strangler fig (Ficus nymphaeifolia) , which reaches 23 to 115 feet (7-35 m) in height, produces seeds that can germinate on the branches of another tree. This permits it to grow to a tree of great size that develops an extended crown of long, strong branches. Its roots descend to the ground along the trunk of the host tree and fuse together, forming a thick lattice. The distinct varieties of trees of the Ficus genus are characteristic of the rainforests of the intertropical zone. Many are of American origin.

There are groups of epiphytes that, in their quest to reach the soil and turn into trees, are capable of strangling and killing the tree on which they begin to grow. Additionally, some plants behave like parasites or semi-parasites. When the seeds of these plants germinate and their embryos have used up their energy reserves, they continue to grow because they obtain food from their hosts. WITHOUT CLOROPHYLL The stalk and the leaves of these plants do not have chlorophyll; in addition, their leaves are very small. DODDER It forms a genus, Cuscuta , of between 100 and 170 species of parasitic plants that are yellow, orange, or red. Upon coming into contact with its host, the vine begins to develop haustoria. They will grow and penetrate the stalk of the host to reach its vascular tissues (xylem and phloem). After germinating, dodder's stems climb and coil around the stalk of the host until the haustoria develop. The products of photosynthesis circulate through the phloem, where they are accessed by the haustoria. The evolution of plants, like that of living beings in general, has favored the rise of the secondary adaptations shown here. These adaptations have benefited certain species with notable characteristics, such as parasitism. The distinctive trait in these plants is the absence of conductive vessels. Evolutionary Pressure IMPRISONED The aerial roots of the straggler fig move toward the ground, perhaps as the result of geotropism. As the roots grow, they merge together and imprison the host tree.

There are also determinate inflorescences, in which the end of the axis bears the first flower, and flowers farthest from it open last. RACEME The flowers develop on short stalks, called pedicels, along an unbranched axis. SPIKE The flowers form directly from the stem instead of from pedicels. CORYMB The pedicels are of varying lengths. CATKIN Similar to a hanging spike, its flowers are entirely male or female. UMBEL A group of pedicels spread from the end of the flower stalk. COMPOUND RACEME The flower stalks are branched. COMPOUND UMBEL This form is more common than the simple umbel. SPADIX It features a spike with a fleshy axis and dioecious flowers. HEAD The flowers sit on a broad, shortened axis. DAISY The daisy is a composite flower. As with the sunflower, what appears to be a single flower is, in fact, an inflorescence called a head. The head contains a large number of individual flowers, which are attached to a base called a receptacle. LEAVES OR FLOWERS?

Cacti are the best known of these species. They have spines that developed to minimize water loss and to provide protection against herbivores.

Cactaceae Stems Distribution Cacti are found in deserts or very dry climates. They have also adapted to the dry and warm climates of Australia, the Mediterranean, and East Africa. ADAPTING TO THE ENVIRONMENT One of the main characteristics of Cactaceae is their ability to resist drought by storing water. Their roots usually extend only a short distance into the ground, which allows them to better absorb occasional rainfall. Some roots grow toward the surface in order to collect dew. Their skin is covered with wax, which makes it tough and waterproof and helps prevent water loss. CRASSULACEAN ACID METABOLISM (CAM) Carbon dioxide is taken in at night and stored as organic acids. The plant is therefore able to avoid water loss by closing its stomas during the day, when it carries out photosynthesis.

P oisonous plants are the type that no one wants in the garden. Although some plants have healing properties, others have substances that, when they enter the body, provoke noxious reactions that cause injury or even death. The most infamous of these plants is hemlock, which can also be used medicinally. The primary active components of poisonous plants are alkaloids. One of the most potent poisons from plants is ricin: 0.35 ounce (1 mg) is enough to kill a person. Several cultivated and wild plants have active ingredients that have various levels of toxicity for people and animals. The castor bean (Ricinus communis) contains ricin, and chewing two of its seeds can be fatal for a child. Digitalis contains substances that can cause a heart attack. Other common poisonous plants, such as oleanders, provoke diarrhea, nausea, and other symptoms if their flowers or fruits are eaten. Other Poisonous Plants Poison is a substance that produces illness or tissue lesions or that interrupts natural vital processes when it comes into contact with the human organism. Dosage is a key factor for a substance to act as a poison. The same substance that can produce death in an organism can, in smaller concentrations, act as a medicine and provide relief from certain types of suffering. A Matter of Quantity Hemlock Water Dropwort Oenanthe crocata SOCRATES This philosopher died by drinking hemlock, a sentence imposed by the Greek court. WAR FLOWER It is said that belladonna was used to poison Mark Antony's troops during the Parthian wars. IDENTIFICATION In winter the plant has no leaves but greenish white berries. In the summer the berries are green; they are red in the spring and can be yellow in early autumn. Poison Ivy is a low vine that grows along the ground and often climbs walls, tree trunks, and bushes. It has bright green leaves that have an oily toxin, which causes light to severe allergic reactions. The symptoms can appear between one and three days after having touched the plant. Belladonna (Deadly Nightshade) has three alkaloids that are considered poisonous: hyoscine, scopolamine, and atropine. These substances affect the autonomous nervous system, which regulates breathing and cardiac rhythm. In medicine atropine in low dosages decreases the intensity of intestinal contractions. 10% OF VEGETABLE SPECIES have alkaloids, compounds formed with nitrogen. Poison Hemlock Also known as Conium maculatum , this herbaceous plant belongs to the Umbelliferae family. It has a hollow, striated stem, with purple spots at its base. Though poisonous, it has been used to calm strong pains and headaches. Poison hemlock has a characteristic offensive, urinelike odor. The active component in hemlock is coniine, an alkaloid that has neurotoxic effects. BURNING Intoxication produces a dry mouth, dilated pupils (mydriasis), and nausea. 1.

Obtaining high-quality olive oil involves a chain of processes that begins at the tree and ends with the packaging of the end product. The quality begins in the fields and depends on a combination of soil, climate, oil variety, and cultivation and harvesting techniques. The remaining operations in the extraction process (transportation, storage, manufacturing, and extraction of the oil) are responsible for maintaining that quality. 74 RARE AND USEFUL PLANTS Olive Oil After a good crop, olive trees usually do not produce well the following year. Alternating Years Washing and Classification The fruits are carefully washed with water and then classified according to their variety. 2 Refining The oil obtained is separated from the other solid residues, impurities, and water. Since antiquity, this process has been carried out by decantation, which requires letting the oil sit undisturbed after it comes out of the press. Today it can also be carried out with vertical centrifugal machines. 5 Bottling is carried out in a plant, although sometimes it is done manually to ensure product quality. Glass, alu- minum, and plastic containers are used. It cannot be stored where it will be exposed to light, odors, or heat for extended periods. 7 Pressing Traditionally, the paste that includes the entire olive is placed on a system of stacked discs and then compressed by a hydraulic press. 4 Storage Virgin olive oil has nonfat components that have to be preserved during storage and packaging. It must be kept in a dark place at a stable temperature. 6 STONE WHEEL Hammer systems are also used. RESIDUE can be used to obtain other oils.

THE QUALITY OF THE OIL The oil that comes out of the first pressing from good quality fruits and with an acid level lower than 0.8 percent is called extra virgin. After this pressing the other levels of oil quality are obtained. NEW PLANTINGS are propagated through staking, layering, or the taking of cuttings. Cultivation Plowed land, a moderate climate, an altitude of up to 2,300 feet (700 m) above sea level, and up to 15 inches (40 cm) of rain per year sum up the conditions needed for the development of olive plants.

It is based on respect for the interaction between the mind, the body, energy, and the environment. Its basic principles include the five elements and the yin and yang. It is based on the concept of chi, the vital energy in equilibrium in people's bodies. Chi regulates lost equilibrium.

Fungi can develop in all sorts of environments, especially damp and poorly lit places, up to elevations of 13,000 feet (4,000 m). They are divided into four large phyla, in addition to a group of fungi called “imperfect” because they generally do not reproduce sexually. At present, 15,000 species of fungi fall into this category. DNA analysis has recently reclassified them as Deuteromycetes.

THERE ARE BELIEVED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1,500,000 SPECIES. Chytridiomycota are the only fungi that, at some point in their lives, have mobile cells—male and female gametes, which they release into water in order to reproduce. They live in water or on land, feeding on dead material or living as parasites on other living organisms. Their cell walls are made of chitin. Deuteromycota are also called “imperfect fungi” because they are not known to have a form of sexual reproduction. Many live as parasites on plants, animals, or humans, causing ringworm or mycosis on the skin. OthersΩsuch as Penicillium , which produces penicillin, and Cyclospora Ωhave great medicinal and commercial value. Ascomycota is the phylum with the most species in the Fungi kingdom. It includes yeasts and powdery mildews, many common black and yellow-green molds, morels, and truffles. Its hyphae are partitioned into sections. Their asexual spores (conidia) are very small and are formed at the ends of special hyphae. 0.1 inch (3 mm) Slime Mold Physarum polycephalum Pathogenic Mold Aspergillus niger Ergot Claviceps purpurea Black Bread Mold Rhizopus nigricans Chanterelle Mushroom Cantharellus cibarius Spores Fruiting Bodies Conidiophores Hyphae Mycelium White Mycelium OF UNKNOWN SEX In Deuteromycetes, conidia are tiny spores that function asexually.

They also reproduce asexually. Most zygomycetes live in the soil and feed on plants or dead animal matter. Some live as parasites on plants, insects, or small land animals.

On the contrary, they absorb it after breaking it down into small molecules. Most of them feed on dead organic material. Other fungi are parasites, which feed on living hosts, or predators, which live off the prey they trap. Many others establish relationships of mutual benefit with algae, bacteria, or plants and receive organic compounds from them. PARASITES Fungi such as Ceratocystis ulmi and Agrocybe aegerita (shaded areas on the leaf) live at the expense of other plants, which they can even kill. Others live parasitically off animals. SAPROBES There is no organic material that cannot be broken down by this type of fungus. They actually live on the dead parts of other plants, so they cause no harm to the host. SYMBIOTIC While feeding off the plant, they help it to obtain water and mineral salts more easily from the soil. Each species has its own characteristics. The organic or inorganic substances that fungi feed on are absorbed directly from the environment. Fungi first secrete digestive enzymes onto the food source. This causes a chemical transformation that results in simpler, more easily assimilated compounds. Basidiomycetes are classified according to their diet. For example, they colonize different parts of a tree depending on the nutrients they require. Chemical Transformation MYCELIUM When a mushroom spore finds the right medium, it begins to generate a network of hyphae, branching filaments that extend into the surrounding medium. This mass of hyphae is called a mycelium. A mushroom forms when threads of the mycelium are compacted and grow upward to create a fruiting body. FRUITING BODY The basidiocarp, or mushroom cap, generates new spores. VEGETATIVE MYCELIUM It is made of branches of threadlike hyphae that grow underground. Fungi of the genus Amanita , including the poisonous A. muscaria shown here, have the well- known mushroom shape with a mushroom cap. Hyphae Spore- producing structures Growth At birth the fruiting body of the species Amanita muscaria looks like a white egg. It grows and opens slowly as the mushroom's body unfolds. As it grows the cap first appears completely closed. During the next several days it opens like an umbrella and acquires its color. CUTICLE The skin, or membrane, that covers the cap, or pileus, is called the cuticle. It can have a variety of colors and textures, such as velvety, hairy, scaly, threadlike, fibrous, fuzzy, smooth, dry, or slimy. Fungi can break down an impressive variety of substances. For example, a number of species can digest petroleum, and others can digest plastic. Fungi also provided the first known antibiotic, penicillin. They are now a basic source of many useful medical compounds. Scientists are studying the possibility of using petroleum-digesting fungi to clean up oil spills and other chemical disasters. Did You Know? HALLUCINOGENIC MUSHROOM Psilocybin aztecorum CAP Besides being easy to spot, the cap is the fertile part of basidiomycetes; it contains spores. LIFE CYCLE OF A FUNGUS Fungi produce spores during sexual or asexual reproduction. Spores serve to transport the fungus to new places, and some help the fungus to survive adverse conditions. HYMENIUM It is located on the underside of the cap. It contains very fine tissues that produce spores. Its structure can consist of tubes, wrinkles, hairlike projections, or even needles.

Basidiospore Basidium Detail of a Gill Spore formation by fertilization Hyphae formation STEM Cylindrical in shape, it holds up the cap and reveals important information for identifying the species. RING Also known as the veil, it protects part of the hymenium in young fungi. VOLVA The volva is made of the remains of the early rings that have fallen off. It differs from species to species."},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 87 86 FUNGI Poison in the Kingdom A poisonous fungus is one that, when ingested, causes toxic effects. In terms of its effects on the eater, the toxicity can vary according to the species and to the amount ingested. At times poisoning is not caused by eating fungi but by eating foods, such as cereal products, that have been contaminated by a fungus. Rye, and to a lesser extent oats, barley, and wheat, can host toxic fungi that produce dangerous mycotoxins. These mycotoxins can cause hallucinations, convulsions, and very severe damage in the tissues of human organs. Pretty But Deadly This mushroom is toxic to the liver. It grows from spring to fall, often in sandy, acidic soil in woodlands and mountainous regions. Its cap is white and 2 to 5 inches (5-12 cm) in diameter. Its stem and gills are also white, and the gills may appear detached from the stem. The base of the stem has a cuplike volva, but it may be buried or otherwise not visible. Insecticide The fly agaric's name is thought to come from its natural fly-killing properties. Its cap is typically red and 6 to 8 inches (15-20 cm) in diameter. It may be covered with white or yellow warts, but they are absent in some varieties. The stem is thicker at the base, which looks cottony. It also has a large white ring that looks like a skirt. It grows in summer and fall in coniferous and deciduous forests. If eaten, it causes gastrointestinal and psychotropic symptoms. DESTROYING ANGEL Amanita virosa Eating the fruiting bodies of some species can be very dangerous if it is not clearly known which are edible and which are poisonous. There is no sure method for determining the difference. However, it is known for certain that some speciesΩsuch as certain species of the genera Amanita, Macrolepiota , and Boletus Ωare poisonous. Poisonous Mushrooms Fruit The perithecium is a type of fruiting, or reproductive, body in ascomycetes. It is a type of closed ascocarp with a pore at the top. The asci are inside the perithecium. 2. Spores The asci are sac-shaped cells that contain spores called ascospores. In general, they grow in groups of eight and are light enough to be scattered into the air. 3. Parasites Ascospores of sexual origin or asexual conidia develop as parasites in the ovary of the rye flower. They cause the death of its tissues and form sclerotia. In some languages ergot's name is related to the word for “horn” because of sclerotia's hornlike shape. 4. Release Within the enclosing structures a stroma, or compact somatic body, is formed. Inside it reproductive growths develop, which contain a large number of perithecia. 1. Ergot ( Claviceps purpurea ) is a parasite of rye and produces alkaloid mycotoxins—ergocristine, ergometrine, ergotamine, and ergocryptine. When barley with ergot is processed for use in food, the mycotoxins can be absorbed when eaten. All these toxic substances can act directly on nerve receptors and cause the constriction of blood vessels. Attack on Rye In Europe during the Middle Ages wheat bread was a costly food, not part of the common diet. Most people ate bread and drank beer prepared from rye. This made them susceptible to ingesting mycotoxins from Claviceps purpurea . Thus, the largest number of cases of ergotism occurred during this time. Today preventative controls in the production of bread and related products from rye and other cereals have greatly reduced instances of ergotism. RYE BREAD WHISKEY FLOUR Ergotism, or St. Anthony's Fire, is a condition caused by eating products such as rye bread that have been contaminated with alkaloids produced by Claviceps purpurea fungi, or ergot. The alkaloids typically affect the nervous system and reduce blood circulation in the extremities, which produces the burning sensation in the limbs that is one of the condition's notable symptoms. EXTREMITIES Ergotamine alkaloids cause the constriction of blood vessels, leading to gangrene. NERVOUS SYSTEM Lethargy, drowsiness, and more severe conditions, such as convulsions, hallucinations, and blindness, are symptoms caused by the effects of ergot on the nervous system. Ergotism INGESTION The main means of intake of the mycotoxins is through products manufactured with flour. Derived from Rye ERGOTISM (ST. ANTHONY'S FIRE) FLY AGARIC Amanita muscaria ERGOT Claviceps purpurea"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 89 Pathogens 88 FUNGI F ungi that are able to cause illnesses in people, animals, or plants are called pathogens. The nocive, or toxic, substances that these organisms produce have negative effects on people and cause significant damage to agriculture. One reason these pathogens are so dangerous is their high tolerance to great variations in temperature, humidity, and pH. Aspergillus is a genus of fungi whose members create substances that can be highly toxic. ALLERGENICS Aspergillus flavus This species is associated with allergic reactions in people with a genetic predisposition to this allergy. They also cause the contamination of seeds, such as peanuts. They produce secondary metabolites, called micotoxins, that are very toxic. SAPROBIA Aspergillus sp. In addition to the pathogen species, there are some species of Aspergillus that decompose the organic matter of dead insects, thus incorporating nutrients into the soil. Aspergillum Aspergillus are “imperfect” fungi, or deuteromycetes, that are characterized by having reproductive structures called conidial heads. The head is composed of a vesicle that is surrounded by a crown of phialides shaped like a bottle, at the end of which spore chains form. THE NUMBER OF ASPERGILLUS SPECIES. THEY HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED INTO 18 GROUPS. MOST OF THESE SPECIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN ILLNESSES, SUCH AS ASPERGILLOSIS. 900 SPECIES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HUMAN ILLNESSES. ASPERGILLUS FUMIGATUS , A. FLAVUS, A. NIGER , AND A. TERREUS ARE EXAMPLES. 12 BREAD MOLD Aspergillus niger The fruiting body is yellowish white, but it will turn black when the conidia mature. Its conidiophores are large and have phialides that cover all its conidial head vesicle. They can be found in mold-covered food. OPPORTUNISTIC Aspergillus fumigatus This pathogen can affect people whose immune systems are weakened. It can cause serious invasive diseases. CONIDIA are so small that they spread through the air without any difficulty. CONIDIOPHORE The part of the mycellium of the fruiting, or reproductive, body in which asexual spores, or conidia, are formed PHIALIDES are cells from which conidia are formed. CONIDIAL HEAD Has a greenish mycellium and short and abundant conidiophores. CONIDIA CHAIN Conidia are asexual spores that form at the ends of the hyphae. In this case they group together in chains."},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"CELL MEMBRANE The cell membrane controls what enters or exits the cell. It acts as a selective filter. Yeast from the genus Sacchromyces cerevisiae can reproduce both asexually and sexually. If the concentration of oxygen is adequate, the yeasts will reproduce sexually, but if oxygen levels are drastically reduced, then gemation will take place instead. Gemation is a type of asexual proliferation that produces child cells that split off from the mother cell. Starting with barley grain, this process produces water, ethyl alcohol, and a large quantity of CO 2 , the gas that forms the bubbles typically found in beer. NUCLEUS It coordinates all the cell's activities. Its duplication is vital in making each child cell the same as its progenitor cell. MITOCHONDRIA These subcellular structures become very active when the cell is in an environment rich in oxygen. VACUOLE This organelle contains water and minerals that are used in the cell's metabolism. The concentration of these nutrients helps regulate the activity of the cell. ENZYME PRODUCTION Internal membrane systems produce the enzymes that regulate the production of alcohol and carbon dioxide in the cells. GEMATION Buds, or gems, which will become independent in a new cell, are formed in different parts of a yeast. RELEASE OF THE ASCOSPORES The opening of the ascus releases the spores, which then reproduce by mitosis. UNION OF THE ASCOSPORES The haploid cells fuse and form a new diploid cell. GEMATION Under the right conditions the diploid cells begin to reproduce asexually. MULTIPLICATION A large number of cells are produced in this stage. MEIOSIS A diploid cell forms four haploid cells. SPORES A sac called an ascus is formed that contains ascospores of yeast. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Fermentation Under anaerobic conditions yeasts can obtain energy and produce alcohol. By means of the alcoholic fermentation process they obtain energy from pyruvic acid, a product of the breakdown of glucose by glucolysis. In this process CO 2 is also produced and accumulated, as is ethyl alcohol. The carbon dioxide will be present in the final product: the beer. Yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 12% THE MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE OF ALCOHOL THAT YEAST WILL TOLERATE Cycle GROW AND MULTIPLY As long as they have adequate nutrients, yeasts will continuously repeat their reproductive life cycle. Many products are made with yeasts, and one of the most important is bread. In the case of bread, yeasts feed off the carbohydrates present in flour. Bread products, unlike alcoholic beverages, need to have oxygen available for the yeast to grow. The fungi release carbon dioxide as they quickly consume the nutrients. The bubbles of carbon dioxide make the dough expand, causing the bread to rise. Homemade Bread Yeast Saccharomyces ellipsoideus PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 91 90 FUNGI Destroying to Build Y easts, like other fungi, decompose organic material. This capacity can be beneficial, and, in fact, human beings have developed yeast products for home and industrial use, such as bread, baked goods, and alcoholic beverages, that attest to its usefulness. Beer manufacturing can be understood by analyzing how yeasts feed and reproduce and learning what they require in order to be productive. Precious Gems WINE YEAST Yeast is also used to produce wine. In wine production, however, the CO 2 that is produced is eliminated."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"92 GLOSSARY PLANTS, ALGAE, AND FUNGI 93 Glossary Adventitious Root Root that appears in unusual places, such as on the stem Algae Organisms of the Protist kingdom, at one time considered plants, but without roots, stems, or leaves.

No matter how you approach it, this is a wonderful book not only for its pictures, splendid illustrations, size, and format but also because, as you read it, you will discover secrets about these inhabitants of the Earth, which, according to the history of evolution, came into being before humans. The text is written in a direct, easy-to-understand style. Most birds have a much-envied ability that has inspired poems and all types of experiments: they can fly. This enables them to see the Earth from afar, with its seas, mountains, rivers, cities, and other features. It has been estimated that more than 200 million birds migrate each year, all over the planet. Many of them fly thousands of miles, crossing desolate deserts and windy seas to arrive in Africa or Antarctica. Some find their way using the sun, the moon, and the stars; others follow their parents or use the course of rivers or mountain chains as references. In general, smaller birds migrating across continents stop several times to get food. It is surprising how fast they travel, in spite of these stops: it has been calculated that some small species cover almost 2,500 miles (4,000 km) in five or six days. Several studies have shown that carrier pigeons and white- headed sparrows, for example, can travel more than 600 miles (1,000 km) per day. Some ducks, such as the blue-winged teal, complete their trip from Canada to central Mexico in about 35 days, making several stops to feed along the way. B irds never cease to amaze us, whether hiding in trees, flying over high mountaintops, or nesting in Antarctica or on tall buildings. Perhaps the reason for such amazement is their behavior, which continues to be a mystery to human beings, as well as the differences among them. It is believed that there are approximately 9,700 living bird species in the world—more species than in any other vertebrate group except for fish. Once they reach adulthood, birds' weight varies from a mere 0.06 ounce (1.6 g), in the case of hummingbirds, to as much as 330 pounds (150 kg) for African ostriches. Even though most birds fly, there are some—such as kiwis, rheas, and ostriches—that run quickly on the ground. Some birds, being perfectly adapted to aquatic life, live in oceans, rivers, and lakes. The shape of their feet and bills varies according to the environment in which they live. Some aquatic species have bills modified to filter small water particles, whereas birds of prey have strong bent bills to hold down and tear apart their prey. What is the diet of birds based on? Because of their great diversity and wide distribution, their diets differ greatly. In general, birds eat a bit of everything, although insects are the most important element of their diet. They eat fruit, seeds, nectar, pollen, leaves, carrion, and other vertebrates. Most birds lay their eggs in nests. Worthy of mention is the protective attitude that both males and females have toward their young. Adult birds care for their chicks, warn and protect them against the danger of predators, and guide them to safe places where they can live and feed. We invite you to investigate up close the world of these fascinating beings that are able to run, climb, swim, dive, and cross the skies.

As a group, birds have exceptional eyesight—they have the largest eyes in relation to the size of their bodies. In addition, they have very light bones, which are suitable for flight. Just like their bills, birds' feet have also changed in accordance with the functions and particular needs of each species. For instance, walking birds—like other vertebrate groups—display a marked tendency toward having a reduced number of toes; ostriches, for example, have only two. Some birds of prey, such as eagles, have feet that are veritable hooks.

They have modified bones and characteristic plumage. CHEST SONGBIRDS Passeriformes, or passerines, form the most numerous group among birds; they are characterized by a well-developed syrinx that enables them to emit harmonious songs and trills and by a soft plumage of varied colors. Because of their brain development, it is believed that passerines were the most recent birds to come into existence. BIRDS 9 8 THE NATURE OF BIRDS Beyond Feathers D efining what a bird is brings to mind an animal covered with feathers that has a toothless bill and anterior extremities morphed into wings. Other distinguishing characteristics are that they are warm-blooded and have pneumatic bones—bones filled with air chambers instead of marrow. Birds have very efficient circulatory and respiratory systems and great neuromuscular and sensory coordination. FEATHERS Unique. No other living animal has them. They are appealing for their structure, variety, and constant renewal. FEET Birds walk on their toes. In general, they have three toes pointing forward and one pointing backward. EYE INNER EAR TARSUS BILL Originates in the epidermis. It is hard and resistant, with a consistency similar to that of horns. It grows continuously, like nails and feathers. Variety and Uniformity We can find birds in every type of environment: aquatic, aerial, and terrestrial, in polar regions and in tropical zones. Their adaptation to the environment has been very successful. Nevertheless, birds are one of the groups that display the fewest differences among their members. Adaptation to Flying Some crucial anatomic and physiological characteristics explain birds' ability to fly. Their bodies and feathers reduce friction with the air and improve lift. Their strong muscles, light bones, air sacs, and closed double circulatory system also play a role in their ability to fly.

The most widespread theory states that birds descend from theropods, dinosaurs that walked on two legs. Fossils of dinosaur specimens with feathers have been found, but Archaeopteryx, a primitive bird that lived 150 million years ago, is the oldest relative known. Completely covered with feathers, it had a pair of wings that enabled it to fly. However, it retained many dinosaur traits. Origin SPINE Movable. The cervical vertebrae have a concave joint like that of the theropods, not a saddle-shaped one like that of birds. REPTILIAN JAWBONES WITH TEETH Unlike modern birds, it did not have a horn bill. There was a tight row of sharp teeth on each jawbone.

The first one, found in Bavaria, Germany, was very important because its discovery coincided with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, at a time when the search for evolutionary “missing links” fascinated scientists. The original is located in the British Museum. Another fossil, which includes the head, is in the Berlin Museum. ARCHAEOPTERYX MODERN BIRD Brain TOES The foot is functionally tridactyl.

Modern birds have tail vertebrae that are fused together into a single bone called the pygostyle. During flight, it functioned as a rudder. On the ground, it provided balance for walking."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"Skeleton and Musculature B oth lightweight and resistant, the skeleton of birds underwent important changes in order to adapt to flight. Some bones, like those of the skull and wings, fused to become lighter. Birds have fewer bones than other vertebrates. Because their bones are hollow, containing internal air chambers, the total weight of their bones is less than that of their feathers. Birds' spines tend to be very flexible in the cervical region and rigid near the rib cage, where a large, curved frontal bone called the sternum attaches. The sternum features a large keel, to which the pectoral muscles attach. These large, strong muscles are used for flapping the wings. In contrast, running birds, such as ostriches, have more developed muscles in their legs. SKULL Light because of the fusing of bones, the skull does not have teeth, a bony jaw, or grinding muscles. HUMMINGBIRD Because of its adaptation to stationary flight, its pectoral muscles can account for 40 percent of its total weight. CERVICAL VERTEBRAE Their number varies according to the type of bird. They make the neck flexible. EYE SOCKET CORACOIDS FEET Birds have four toes, just like their ancestors, the reptiles. HUMERUS RADIUS ULNA CARPAL BONES KNEE FALSE KNEE TARSOMETATARSUS TOES TIBIA Flapping Wings Flying demands an enormous amount of energy and strength. Consequently, the muscles responsible for flapping the wings become very large, easily comprising 15 percent of the weight of a flying bird. Two pairs of pectorals, in which one muscle of the pair is bigger than the other, work to raise and lower the wings. They function symmetrically and in opposition to each other: when one contracts, the other relaxes. Their placement within the thoracic cavity corresponds roughly to the bird's center of gravity. The motion of the wings also requires strong tendons. DOWNWARD FLAP UPWARD FLAP 1. The descending flapping of the wings takes place. 2. The pectoral muscles relax. 1. The smaller pectorals contract and draw the wings inward. 2. Humerus Coracoids Legs The larger pectorals contract. The smaller pectorals relax. Tendon Right Wing Left Wing Humerus Coracoids Tendon Right Wing Left Wing Legs UPPER MANDIBLE OF BILL In some species, it is flexible. LOWER MANDIBLE OF BILL It is flexible, allowing birds to open their mouths wide. FURCULA (COLLARBONE) Known as the wishbone, it is unique to birds and results from the fusion of the collarbones. Biceps Triceps Extensor Metacarpi Radialis Flexor Digitorum Superficialis Tendons that tie the muscles to the wing Wings Without a doubt, wings are the greatest adaptation of birds. Strong tendons travel through the wings and merge into the hand bones, where the feathers are attached. LEG MUSCLES SUPPORT POSITION GRASPING DEVICE When a bird is perched, it assumes a crouching position with its legs bent. This causes the tendons in its feet to tighten, which pulls its toes closed and locks its feet in place. This tendon-locking mechanism keeps birds from falling off branches while they sleep. Tendons Locked Toes Gastrocnemius Peroneus Longus Iliotibialis Lateralis Semitendinous Flexor THE COLOR OF THE FLESH depends on the blood circulation in the muscles: the more circulation, the redder the flesh. Flying birds have red flesh, whereas nonflying birds, such as chickens, have white flesh. STERNUM Hyperdeveloped in flying birds, the sternum's long keel facilitates the attachment of the pectorals. PELVIS BIRDS 13 12 THE NATURE OF BIRDS PYGOSTYLE The tail vertebrae are merged; the tail feathers are anchored to the tail. CARPOMETACARPUS It is formed by the fusion of the hand bones. TOES Pneumatic Bones Many of a bird's bones are pneumatic—that is, they are full of air instead of bone marrow. Some bones even have prolongations of air sacs. The bones may look fragile at first glance, but their incredible strength comes from a network of internal trabeculae (spongy bone structures), which resemble the trusses of a metal bridge. FEMUR Keel"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"Internal Organs B irds in flight can consume oxygen at a rate that a well-trained athlete would not be able to withstand for even a few minutes. Because of this oxygen consumption, all their organs have had to adapt. The lungs of birds, though smaller than those of mammals of similar size, are much more efficient. Their lungs have several air sacs that both increase the efficiency of their respiratory systems and make them lighter. A special feature of the digestive system is a crop in the esophagus, where food is stored for digestion or for feeding the young. A bird's heart can be four times larger in relation to its body size than a human's in relation to its body size.

Digestive System Birds have no teeth. They therefore ingest food without chewing, and their stomachs break it down. The stomach is divided into two parts: the glandular (or proventriculus) part, which secretes acids, and the muscular (or gizzard) part, whose muscular walls grind up what is eaten. In general, the process is very fast because flying requires a lot of energy, and the bird has to replenish that energy quickly. The digestive system ends at the cloaca, which is an excretory orifice shared with the urinary system. Birds absorb almost all the water they drink. Respiratory System Birds have the most efficient respiratory system of any vertebrate because of the great effort that flying demands. It has two small, almost rigid lungs that are assisted by nine air sacs distributed throughout the body. The air sacs work as bellows, but they do not carry out gas exchange. Oxygen enters the bloodstream through the parabronchi, which are much like the alveoli in human lungs, in that they serve as the tissue for gas exchange. In the parabronchi, blood and air flow past each other in tiny passages. Because air flows in one direction through the lungs, and blood in the lung capillaries flows in the opposite direction, birds can make use of all the air they inhale, much like fish can with their gills and in contrast with mammals, which cannot. A Highly Complex Heart Similar to that of reptiles, but having a heart with four chambers instead of three, the circulatory system distributes nutrients and oxygen throughout the body according to the body's needs. The heart's size and rate vary, depending on the bird's weight and activities. In general, bigger birds have smaller and slower hearts. For example, the heart of a seagull on the ground beats 130 times a minute; in flight, it beats 625 times a minute. A hummingbird's heart can beat 700 times a minute.

The right side pumps blood only to the lungs. 1 TYPES OF GIZZARD 1 STORAGE Some birds have a crop, which enables them to store food and digest it later. This way they decrease their exposure to predators. PRODUCTION The proventriculus secretes the gastric juices that initiate digestion. BREAKDOWN In the gizzard, a strong and muscular pouch, food is broken down with the help of swallowed stones or sand. The stones and sand play the role of teeth. WATER ABSORPTION occurs in the small intestine. Birds normally get water from the food they ingest. EXCRETION The cloaca expels feces mixed with urine coming from the excretory system. 2 3 4 5 FOOD ITINERARY Granivorous Birds have thick muscle walls and strong mucous membranes (or internal skin) to break down seeds.

Birds have the largest eyes with respect to the size of their bodies. This enables them to see distant objects with considerable precision. Their field of vision is very broad, over 300 degrees, but in general they have little binocular vision. The ear—a simple orifice, but very refined in nocturnal hunters—helps them notice sounds inaudible to humans, which facilitates the detection of prey while flying. The senses of touch and smell, on the other hand, are important only to some birds, and the sense of taste is almost nonexistent. A B A B Binocular vision is essential for measuring distances without making mistakes. The brain processes the images that each eye generates separately as if they were a single image. The small differences between the two images allow the brain to create a third one in depth, or in three dimensions. Hunting birds, for which the correct perception of distance is a life-and- death matter, tend to have eyes located toward the front, with a wide field of binocular vision. In contrast, birds with lateral eyes calculate distance by moving their heads, but they record a larger total field of vision to avoid becoming prey. Owls are the birds with the greatest binocular vision—up to 70 degrees. NONHUNTING BIRDS' FIELD OF VISION The lateral eyes open the field of vision to as much as 360 degrees but reduce the binocular field. HUNTING BIRDS' FIELD OF VISION Frontal eyes reduce the total field of vision but allow for a wide field of binocular vision. is the most developed sense in birds because some flight maneuvers, as well as the recognition of food from afar, depend on it. Birds have relatively large eyes. In most cases, they are wider than they are deep because the lens and the cornea— which is supported by a series of sclerotic bony plates—project beyond the eye socket. In hunting birds, the eyes are almost tubular. The muscles around the eye change its shape, alter the lens, and create greater visual acuity: birds typically have a 20-fold magnification (and sometimes, as in the case of some diving birds, a 60-fold magnification), in comparison with humans. Their sensitivity to light is also remarkable, with some species being able to recognize light spectra invisible to the human eye. Vision The Ear Birds' ears are simpler than those of mammals: a bird's ear has no outer portion, and in some cases it is covered with rigid feathers. A notable part of the ear is the columella—a bone that birds share with reptiles. The ear is nonetheless well developed, and birds have very acute hearing; whereas human beings can detect just one note, birds can detect many. The ear is essential to a bird's balance, a key factor in flying. It is also believed that in certain species the ear works as a barometer, indicating altitude. LOCATION OF THE EARS Located at different heights on the head, the ears cause the sense of hearing to occur with a slight delay. In nocturnal hunters, such as owls, this asymmetry allows for the triangulation of sounds and the tracking of prey with a minimal margin of error. Touch, Taste, and Smell The sense of touch is well developed in the bill and tongue of many birds, especially in those birds that use them to find food, such as shore birds and woodpeckers. Usually the tongue is narrow, with few taste buds, but they are sufficient to distinguish among salty, sweet, bitter, and acidic tastes. The sense of smell is not very developed: although the cavity is broad, the olfactory epithelium is reduced. In some birds, such as kiwis and scavengers (condors, for example), the olfactory epithelium is more developed.

This determines the bill's color. T he beak, or bill, is a projecting structure of horn—made out of the same material as the nails—that grows as it is worn down. In the case of adult birds, bill size remains constant. The bill is joined to the skull in a way that allows for the movement of the lower mandible and, thus, the opening of the mouth. Most birds depend on their bills to get food. There are many types of bills, which differ in size, shape, color, and hardness, depending on the way in which the bird gets its food. LOWER JAW UPPER MAXILLARY BONE LOWER MAXILLARY BONE RAVEN Because of its unrestricted diet, its bill is simple and relatively long. FLAMINGO Flamingos have thin, threadlike structures inside their bills whose function is similar to that of the baleen of whales. They feed on microorganisms through filtration. TOUCANS AND ARICARI With their long, thick bills, they can reach fruit located on branches that are too thin for the bird to sit on. Their bills are also used to break the peels and seeds of fruits. GREENFINCH Like granivores in general, it has a strong, conical bill, used to detach seeds from plants and, sometimes, to crack them. FALCON It uses the false (tomial) tooth at the tip to detach the flesh from the bone and to break the spine of its prey. HERON The heron fishes in shallow waters and has a long, solid, sharp bill that quickly slices through the water to easily harpoon fish. HUMMINGBIRD The ability to reach the bottom of a flower in order to suck nectar requires not only a long, thin bill but also a special tongue. CROSSBILL It feeds only on pine seeds. It uses its bill to reach the scales of pine cones, open them, and extract the pine nuts. PREMAXILLA DENTARY COMMISSURE Heterogeneous Shapes Bills have a wide array of names and shapes, but they are usually classified according to their length in relation to the head (short or long); to the curvature of its axis (pointing upward or downward); to its width; to its general shape (conical, stiletto-shaped, or spatula-shaped); and to the presence or absence of accessory pieces, such as grooves, horny plates, or false serrated teeth. There is a close relationship between a bird's bill and its diet. Because the bill serves to pick up, hunt, tear, and transport the food, depending on the bird's lifestyle, its appearance is related to the bird's diet. If the diet is very specific, the bill tends to have an adapted, unique shape, as is the case with hummingbirds. Omnivorous birds, on the other hand, have simple bills with no special alterations that are suitable for all tasks. You Are What You Eat Parts of the Bill Each jaw has characteristic elements. In the upper one, from the back to the front, are the nostrils (or nasal cavities), the culmen (or maxillary cover), and the tip, which, in carnivorous birds, contains the tomial, or killing, tooth. In the lower jaw is the gonys, or cover. The variations found in each part of the bill are conditioned by the bill's function. 18 THE NATURE OF BIRDS Hardness Its long, stout bill is extraordinarily hard. Despite its appearance, the bill is very light, and birds can use it adeptly to seize and to open the fruits they eat."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"20 THE NATURE OF BIRDS Claws, Scales, and Spurs These striking foot structures play a role in finding food, movement, protection, and defense, among other things. The claws can be long and sharp, in the case of birds of prey, or short and round, in the case of walking birds. Owls have a comblike claw that they use to groom their plumage. Their scales, inherited from reptiles, help protect their feet. In some cases, they help the birds to move through water. Many birds, such as chickens, pheasants, and crested screamers (a South American waterbird), have a spur, which they use as a defensive or offensive weapon. Birds walk on their toes, which form the first portion of their feet. The second portion is formed by the tarsometatarsus. Its top part is connected to the tibia, through a joint similar to that of our ankle. That is why the leg flexes backward. The knee, equivalent to ours, is higher up and works like a hip. It is located close to the body, and it helps to maintain balance. The thigh bone also stabilizes the body by adding weight to the skeleton. All the movements of these bones are controlled by tendons and muscles. Internal/External Structure Thigh Knee Knee Thigh Tibia Heel Tarsus and Metatarsus Metatarsus To e s Hallux Tarsus FOOT Foot Heel Tibia TIBIA The tibia merges into tarsal bones and forms the tibiotarsus. It has a slightly developed fibula on its lateral face. THE FOOT II The distal tarsal bones merge into the metatarsal bone and create tarsometatarsal bones. ANKLE Also known as a false knee because it looks like a knee that flexes backward. In reality, it is the ankle. KNEE AND THIGH The thigh is included in the body and has a shortened femur. The knee is near the center of gravity. Different Types The foot usually has four toes. Three of them have a similar size and position. Opposite them is a smaller toe called the hallux. This pattern varies among different bird groups. For example, the position and shape of toes can differ. There are even cases in which two toes are functional while the others have been reduced in size. This is the case with flightless birds such as rheas. Differences are also found in the skin, which may form a web between the toes and projections of horn. All these characteristics become tools to help the bird survive in its environment and face challenges regarding obtaining food. Adaptation to Trees The common waxbill perches and sleeps on tree branches without expending much energy. The weight of the body alone causes its toes to close tightly around the branch. BIRD LEG HUMAN LEG FEET DESIGNED FOR PERCHING Found on hummingbirds, kingfishers, ovenbirds, and nightjars. They have small feet, with the second, third, and fourth toes joined together. This makes it possible for them to stand still. BIRDS 21 Exposed Legs T aking a quick look at the extremities of birds, including their toes and claws, can help us learn about their behavior. The skin of their legs and feet can have some striking features. All these characteristics reveal information about the environments in which different groups of birds live, as well as about their diets. Scientists use these characteristics as a basis for classifying birds. The detailed study of the anatomy of a bird's leg and foot can offer useful information. The shape and placement of bones, muscles, and tendons make it possible to understand how birds hold their prey or perch on branches, as well as to learn about the mechanics of their movement across the ground and in the water. Toes SCOTS DUMPY ROOSTER (Spurs) The spurs originate in skin and bone tissues. When males fight over territory or over a female, they use their spurs to defend themselves. GREAT CRESTED GREBE (Lobed Toes) In some swimming birds, the toes look like oars. They have a continuous wide border. FEET DESIGNED FOR SEIZING Found on birds of prey and nocturnal rapacious birds. Their feet are strong, and their toes end in long, curved, sharp claws. They seize prey and transport it in flight. FEET DESIGNED FOR WALKING Found on herons, flamingos, and storks. The toes and legs are very long. The hallux is pointed backward. They live in places with soft ground, such as swamps and river banks. FEET DESIGNED FOR CLIMBING Found on parrots, woodpeckers, and cuckoos. The hallux and the fourth toe are pointed backward. This arrangement provides the birds with more strength for climbing tree trunks. FEET DESIGNED FOR RUNNING Found on bustards, curlews, and rheas. They have long legs with short toes. The hallux and the fourth toe are very small, which decreases contact with the ground while running. 2 4 3 1 FEET DESIGNED FOR SWIMMING Alcas, patos y Found on auks, ducks, and penguins, which have a membrane between their toes that forms a web and increases the surface of the foot that is in contact with the water.

The shape of the wings varies according to the needs of each bird group. Some cover considerable distances and thus have long, narrow wings, whereas others have short, rounded wings that allow them to make short flights from branch to branch. Birds also have shiny, colorful feathers that males frequently use both to attract females and to hide from enemies. Feathers are usually renewed once a year, and this process is as vital to birds as feeding.

The evidence that supports each of them tells a story of adaptations to an aerial world in which the fight for food and survival is key. One reasonable theory argues that birds descended from an extinct line of biped reptiles that fed on plants and used to jump from branch to branch to flee. 24 THE ART OF FLYING BIRDS 25 Adaptations IS THE MAXIMUM WEIGHT AN EAGLE CAN CARRY DURING FLIGHT. The eagle itself usually weighs about 13 po ounds (6 kg) and can generally carry prey weighing 6.5 pounds (3 kg). Some eagles, however, have bee n n seen carrying prey estimated to weigh 13 pounds (6 kg). Carrying any more weight would require big gger wings, which would be more difficult to move and less efficient. It is believed that large flyin g g animals dis appeared because of this limitation. Flying Squirrel GLIDING SPECIES OTHER FLYING ANIMALS In flying animals, from primitive pterodactyls to bats, wings have always been a flap of skin. A tear creates serious problems because it takes time to heal, and the wing may be misshapen afterward. THE BEST SOLUTION Feathers are a unique evolutionary advantage. Their versatility, strength, individual nature, and ease of replacement make them an ideal adaptation to flight for vertebrates. THE EMERGENCE OF THE WING It evolved from an arm with a talon into a limb, without a talon, that was adapted for flight. The causes of this change are not yet clear to scientists. However, fossil records show how bones merged until they reached their present forms. FROM SCALES TO FEATHERS The development of feathers brought great advantages to birds because feathers enabled them to fly. Feathers evolved from scales, and they are made of the same material. Feathers keep the body's temperature constant and are lighter than scales. EAGLE In its maneuvers, this great hunter displays the entire evolution of flight. The tips of the wings propel flight; the arms support the bird; and the shoulders enable the flapping movements. The bones are extended and reinforced; then they merge. 150 Today The shoulders can perform a wider range of movements. The fingers merge. 175 Dinosaur arm with pincer claw and limited movement 200 Rotary Shoulder Three Fingers MILLION YEARS AGO MILLION YEARS AGO Emergence of the Tarsometatarsus CLIMBING The evolution of dinosaurs yielded climbing species. JUMPING Adapted to aerial life, they jumped from branch to branch. GLIDING Flight made it possible to move from tree to tree without using the ground. FLAPPING Gliding was improved to cover distances and increase agility. It is known that several evolutionary lineages from both reptiles and birds did not survive the evolutionary process, and that the lineage that truly links these two animal groups has not yet been found. However, some theories state that the change from reptile to bird took place through a long process of adaptation. There are two arguments and a variant: the arboreal theory, which posits an air-ground flight model; the cursory (or running) theory, which focuses on the need for stability when running; and a variant, related to parental care, which posits that dinosaurs started to fly as a way of keeping their eggs safe. From Reptile to Bird RUNNING Their two legs enabled them to run at high speeds. JUMPING As they jumped high, their wings stabilized them, allowing them to catch prey. THE ARBOREAL THEORY This theory, the most accepted for a long time, states that flight was an adaptation to the environment in which certain herbivorous climbing reptiles lived. At first, dinosaurs developed a kind of parachute to protect them if they missed a branch when jumping, and later it became a way to move from tree to tree. Finally, flight evolved to involve the flapping of wings, which allowed the animal to cover greater distances. THE CURSORY, OR RUNNING, THEORY Supported by good fossil evidence, the running theory argues that birds descended from certain bipedal dinosaurs that were fast runners. Their arms opened, evolving into wings, to stabilize them as they jumped. Progression from this development to flying was simply a matter of time. PARENTAL CARE VARIANT This variant proposes that reptiles started to climb trees to prevent their young from becoming prey. Gliding removed the need to climb out of the trees. 3 2 1 4 1 SCALES Resistant, they covered the body of dinosaurs.

They make birds strikingly colorful, protect them against cold and intense heat, enable them to move easily through the air and water, and hide them from enemies. Feathers are also one of the reasons why human beings have domesticated, caught, and hunted birds. A bird's set of feathers is called its plumage, and its color is essential for reproductive success. SPECIAL FEATHERS Vibrissae are special feathers formed by only one filament. Sometimes they have loose barbs at the base that perform a tactile function. They are located at the base of bills or nostrils or around the eyes. They are very thin and are usually blended with contour feathers. POWDER DOWN This special type of feather can be found on some aquatic birds. They grow constantly and break off at the tip into small waxy scales. This “powder” is preened into the plumage to provide protection. 26 THE ART OF FLYING BIRDS 27 Vibrissae Filoplumes CALAMUS It provides the necessary nutrients for feathers to grow. Nerve endings that stimulate the feather's movement are found at its base. This allows the bird to detect changes in its surroundings. Types of Feathers There are three main types of feathers, classified according to placement: those closest to the body are down, or underlying feathers; those at the top are contour feathers; and those on the wings and tail are flight feathers, which are often referred to as remiges (on the wings) and rectrices (on the tail). PREENING THE PLUMAGE Birds need to preen their feathers with their bills not only to keep them clean and free of parasites but also to keep them lubricated, which helps birds resist inclement weather. Birds touch their uropygial, or preen, glands with their bills. Then they distribute the oil and wax this gland produces all over their plumage. This task is a matter of survival. DUST BATH Birds such as pheasants, partridges, ostriches, pigeons, and sparrows perform dust baths to control the amount of grease on their feathers. WHAT IS KERATIN? Keratin is a protein that forms part of the outermost layer of a bird's skin, just as it does in other vertebrate animal groups. Keratin is the main component of feathers, hair, and scales. Its distinct resistance helps keep the hooklets woven together in the vane. This allows birds' feathers to maintain their shape in spite of the pressure exerted by the air during flight. 25,000 THE NUMBER OF FEATHERS THAT LARGE BIRDS, SUCH AS SWANS, CAN HAVE. In contrast, the number of feathers small birds, such as songbirds, can have varies between 2,000 and 4,000. PTERYLAE AND APTERIA At first glance, a bird's body is covered with feathers. However, feathers do not grow all over the body but rather in particular areas called pterylae. This is where the papillae, which create new feathers, are found. The shape and placement of pterylae vary according to species. Pterylae are surrounded by naked areas, called apteria, in which feathers do not grow. Penguins are the only birds whose bodies are completely covered with feathers. This characteristic makes it possible for them to live in cold regions. In the papilla, special skin cells form a follicle. 2 A tube that will extend from its base and become a feather grows in the follicle. SELF-CLEANING WITH ANTS Some birds, such as certain tanagers, catch ants with their bills and grind them. They then oil their feathers with the ground-up ants. It is believed that the acid juices from the squashed ants work as a repellent against lice and other external parasites. Structure The structure of feathers has two parts: a shaft and a blade. The shaft is called the rachis, and the part connected to the bird's skin is called the calamus. The movement of a feather is generated in the rachis. The blade is composed of barbs that branch into barbules. The feather's blade, in which the barbules have a series of barbicels, or hooklets, at the tip, is called a vane. The interlocking hooklets in the vane create a network that adds rigidity and resistance to the feather. It also defines the characteristic aerodynamic shape of feathers and helps make the feather waterproof. When feathers wear out, birds have the ability to replace them with new ones. DOWN These light and silky feathers protect the bird against the cold. They have a short rachis, or none at all. Their barbs are long, and their barbules lack hooklets. In general, down is the first type of feather that birds develop when they hatch. CONTOUR Also called covert feathers, they are short and rounded. They are more rigid than down feathers. Because they cover the body, wings, and tail, they give birds their shape as they fly. INFERIOR UMBILICUS The orifice at the base of the calamus, into which the dermic papilla penetrates.

There are many types of wings; they vary by species. For instance, penguins, which are flightless, use their wings for the specialized task of swimming. Among all wings that have existed in the animal kingdom, those of birds are the best for flying. Their wings are light and durable, and in some cases their shape and effectiveness can be modified during flight. To understand the relationship between wings and a bird's weight, the concept of wing loading, which helps explain the type of flight for each species, is useful. FAST WING Remiges are large and tight to allow for flapping; the surface is reduced to prevent excessive friction. ELLIPTICAL WINGS Functional for mixed flights, they are very maneuverable. Many birds have them. WINGS FOR SOARING ABOVE LAND Wide, they are used to fly at low speeds. The separate remiges prevent turbulence when gliding. WINGS FOR SOARING ABOVE THE OCEAN Their great length and small width make them ideal for gliding against the wind, as flying requires. WINGS FOR SWIMMING In adapting to swimming, the feathers of penguins became short, and they serve primarily as insulation. PRIMARIES They are in charge of propulsion; they are also called remiges. PRIMARY COVERTS They cover the remiges and, with the alula, change the wing shape at will. LARGER FINGER SMALLER FINGER CARPOMETACARPUS ALULAR DIGIT Controls the alula, a feathered projection on the front edge of the wing. ULNA RADIUS HUMERUS CORACOID STERNUM OR KEEL SECONDARIES Their number varies greatly depending on the species. They complete the surface. MEDIAN WING COVERTS They change the wing's lift when they rise slightly. GREATER WING COVERTS They create more surface area and cover the intersection point of the tertiaries. TERTIARIES Together with the secondaries, they create the wing's surface. There are many secondary feathers. Wings in the Animal Kingdom Wings have always been modified arms, from the first models on pterosaurs to those on modern birds. Wings have evolved, beginning with the adaptation of bones. Non-avian wings have a membranous surface composed of flexible skin. They extend from the bones of the hand and body usually down to the legs, depending on the species. Avian wings, on the other hand, are based on a very different principle: the arm and hand form a complex of skin, bone, and muscle, with a wing surface consisting of feathers. Furthermore, the avian wing allows for important changes in form, depending on the bird's adaptation to the environment. Types of Wings According to the environment in which they live and the type of flight they perform, birds have different wing shapes that allow them to save energy and to perform efficiently during flight. The wing shape also depends on the bird's size. Consequently, the number of primary and secondary feathers changes depending on the needs of a given species. Flightless Wings Among these, penguins' wings are an extreme case of adaptation: designed for rowing underwater, they work as fins. On running birds, wings' first and foremost function is to provide balance as the bird runs. These wings are also related to courtship, as birds show off their ornamental feathers during mating season by opening their wings or flapping them. Wings are also very efficient at controlling temperature, as birds use them as fans to ventilate their bodies. WANDERING ALBATROSS ARGENTAVIS MAGNIFICENS (extinct) Wing Size and Loading The wingspan is the distance between the tips of the wings. Together with width, it determines the surface area, which is an essential measurement for bird flight. Not just any wing can support any bird. There is a close relationship between the animal's size (measured by weight) and the surface area of its wings. This relationship is called wing loading, and it is crucial in understanding the flight of certain species. Albatrosses, with large wings, have low wing loading, which makes them great gliders, whereas hummingbirds have to flap their small wings intensely to support their own weight. The smaller the wing loading, the more a bird can glide; the bigger, the faster a bird can fly. Short feathers are located all over the wing. They are wide at the base, with separate feather tips. The outermost primary feathers are shorter than the central ones. The external primary feathers are longer. BIRDS 29 LOOSE FEATHERS Sometimes barbicels are missing, and feathers on the wing come apart, creating a loose and ruffled appearance. PRIMARY FEATHERS Flying birds have from nine to 12 primary feathers. Running birds may have up to 16. FUNCTION The wings of ostriches carry out the functions of balancing, temperature regulation, and courtship. PTERODACTYLS still had talons, and only one finger extended their wings. BATS Four fingers extend the membrane, and the thumb remained as a talon. BIRDS The fused fingers form the tip of the wing where the rectrices, or primary feathers, are attached.

These feathers have multiple uses: they can control aerial maneuvers during flight, work as brakes during landing, and make noise. Males also use them during courtship to dazzle and win over females. Usually the tail is formed by rectrices that vary in number, length, and rigidity depending on the species. FORKED TAIL Found on swallows and frigate birds. The external feathers are very long and look like scissors. MARGINATED TAIL Found on blue jays. The central feathers are only slightly shorter than the external ones. SQUARE TAIL Found on quails. The tail is short, with even-sized feathers. GRADUATED TAIL Found on trogons and kingfishers. When closed, the tail has a layered shape. ROUNDED TAIL Found on some songbirds. The central feathers are only slightly longer than the external ones. OPEN CLOSED Courtship Display The tail feathers of the female black grouse are straight, whereas those of the male have a half-moon shape. They usually keep the feathers closed and near the ground, but during the courtship displays they spread them out and show them off completely. To finish the show, the male runs back and forth in front of the female. 1 The Key to How It Works The tail can perform a variety of functions because of the movement and shape of the feathers. The powerful muscles in the pygostyle prepare the plumage for courtship displays and for flight, provide balance in walking and alighting on trees, and work as rudders for swimming. Black Grouse Lyrurus tetrix The male is recognized by its bluish black plumage and the red caruncle over its eyes. OPEN CLOSED 3 OPEN LANDING I The plumage spreads out, and the main axis of the body is positioned parallel to the ground. LANDING II The body leans backward, and the tail closes. The legs prepare to grab the branch. LANDING III The spread-out tail feathers, together with an intense flapping of the wings, make it possible for the bird to slow down and prepare its body to land. 2 Fan of Rectrices On flying birds, it is light and aerodynamic. On tree-climbing birds, such as woodpeckers, the plumage is rigid, which allows them to use it as a support (pointed tail). The coverts of male peacocks are more developed than their rectrices so that the peacock can show them off. RECTRICES Tail feathers can wear out and fray because of friction during flight or by brushing against vegetation. UNDERTAIL COVERTS Feathers that cover the lower part of rectrices, protecting them against the wear and tear caused by air friction"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"Order of Replacement Many species start molting, a process triggered by hormones, in a specific order. Molting starts with remiges and wing coverts, continues with rectrices, and finishes with body coverts. This gradual process keeps the body temperature stable.

In the secondary remiges, it spreads in two directions. Replacement occurs when the new remiges are three fourths developed. 2 The wing coverts are replaced. Rectrices are replaced from the center outward. This happens simultaneously with the loss of tertiary remiges. SUMMER PLUMAGE The feathers have deep pigmentation. This helps birds blend in with the vegetation. Plumage Molting The main function of molting is to replace worn-out plumage. It also helps the bird adapt its appearance to the seasons and to different stages in life. The renewal can be partial or total. Some feathers are replaced before the spring, when the task is to attract a partner for reproductive purposes. In the fall, before birds have to start caring for their young, the renewal is complete. On most birds, molting takes place in each pteryla, following a determined order. Penguins, however, renew all their feathers at the same time, within two to six weeks. In the epidermal papilla, the formation of the new feather causes the detachment of the worn-out one. A papilla develops from skin cells. The epidermal cells multiply faster than the dermal ones and form a collar-shaped depression called the follicle. The rapid growth of the Malpighian layer starts to develop the new feather. The rachis, barbs, and barbules become keratinized. The vessels that bring nutrients are reabsorbed, and the connection with the dermic layer is closed. Finally the protective vane breaks, and the feather unfurls. The papilla grows and becomes layered. The outermost layer is covered with keratin, which protects the underlying Malpighian layer (nucleus of the papilla). A group of dermal cells brings nutrients through the blood vessels that travel along the new feather. The feather, now lifeless, assumes its characteristic blade shape. A residue of dermal and epidermal cells at the base of the follicle forms an area that will allow for replacement when the feather wears out.

DEVELOPING PLUMAGE VANE BARBS SEASONAL CHANGE In the high mountains, snow transforms the landscape during winter. During this time, nonmigratory birds exchange their summer plumage for a winter one. This change helps them to protect themselves from predators. OLD FEATHER Renewing the plumage is important because it helps keep the bird's body temperature stable. It also keeps the feathers in place while the bird moves about, and it helps the bird to go unnoticed by predators.

It is the replacement of worn-out, older feathers with new ones that are in better condition. In a bird's life cycle, molting is as important an event as migrating or caring for young. The beginning of this phenomenon is determined by environmental factors that trigger a series of hormonal stimuli in birds: they start to eat more and to decrease their other activities. This, in turn, causes them to gain weight through an accumulation of fat that will serve as the source of energy for developing new plumage. BIRDS 33"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"Thermal: Hot Air Warm Air Current Cold Air 1 Ascent When birds find a warm air current, they gain height without having to flap their wings. 2 Straight Gliding Once the maximum possible height is gained, the birds glide in straight paths. 3 4 Ascent They rise again when they encounter another warm air current. TERRESTRIAL BIRDS They use warm, rising air currents generated through convection in the atmosphere or through the deflection of air currents against crags or mountains. Then they glide in a straight flight path. This type of flight is possible only during the day. WINGLETS Terrestrial gliders usually have separate primary feathers (toward the tip of the wing) that serve to decrease the noise and tension generated there by the passing of air. Modern airplanes copy their design. FLIGHT PATTERNS Flying in formation is a way for birds in flapping flight to save energy. The leader encounters more resistance as it flies, while the others take advantage of its wake. There are two basic patterns: “L” and “V.” The first is used by pelicans, and the second is used by geese. Descent The birds slowly glide downward. Ta ke of f Usually, a powerful jump followed by the vertical flapping of the wings is enough to make a bird take flight. As it descends, the tip feathers are stacked on top of each other, forming an airtight surface that helps drive the bird upward. As the bird raises its wings to repeat the movement, the feathers curve and open until the wing reaches its highest point. With a couple of flaps of the wings, the bird is in flight. Bigger birds need a running start on the ground or water in order to take off. THE WING Its particular shape causes lift, with its convex side and less pronounced concave side. TYPES OF GLIDING FEATHERS CONSTANT AIRSTREAM CONTINUOUS AIR FASTER AIRSTREAM LIFT THE ENERGY SAVED BY A SEAGULL WHILE GLIDING 70 % LOWER SIDE Concave. The air covers less distance, it does not accelerate, and its pressure does not change. UPPER SIDE Convex. The air covers more distance and accelerates, causing a lower pressure that “sucks” the wing upward. PATAGIUM Elastic and resistant skin covering with feathers. It is the wing's cutting edge, responsible for dividing the airstream. Fast and Strong Flapping During the downward movement, the primary feathers are closed, which prevents air from passing through. During the upward movement in wing flapping, the primary feathers open up, offering less resistance to the air. Ascent Initial Jump Run THE PERCENTAGE OF WING FLAPPING THAT GEESE SPARE THEMSELVES BY FLYING IN FORMATION 14 % “V” FORMATION The principle is the same, but the birds form two lines that converge at a point. This is the usual formation used by geese, ducks, and herons. 2. 1. 3. “L” FORMATION Leader The leader makes the most effort, as it “parts” the air. The Rest of the Formation The other birds make use of the turbulence produced by the leader's flapping to gain height, following along behind. Dynamic soaring allows birds to cover long distances in the direction they desire. STRONGER WIND is the range in altitude for dynamic soaring. Marine Birds Dynamic soaring is performed by birds with long and thin wings, such as the albatross. These wings are designed to take advantage of horizontal air currents, which are responsible for the formation of waves in the ocean. The result is a flight consisting of a series of loops as the bird is lifted upward when it faces the wind and moved forward when it faces away from the wind. This kind of flight can be performed at any time. 3 to 33 feet (1-10 m) Terrestrial Glider A large wing surface allows it to make the most of rising air currents at moderate speed. Marine Glider Thin and long wings allow it to make the most of the constant surface winds and offer less resistance to forward movement. SPEED OF DISPLACEMENT depends on the strength of the headwind. SECONDARY FEATHERS There are many of these because of the wing's length. PRIMARY FEATHERS There are fewer of these, as they only form the tip. The tip feathers work as airplane winglets. MOVING FORWARD Airplane Winglets are made of one or several pieces. WEAKER WIND Relay When the leader gets tired, another bird takes its position. Air BIRDS 35 34 THE ART OF FLYING Gliding I nvolves using air currents to fly and save energy when traveling long distances. There are two types of gliders, terrestrial birds and marine birds, each of which is adapted to different atmospheric phenomena. Terrestrial birds rise on thermals (rising air currents). Marine birds make use of oceanic surface winds. Once the birds gain altitude, they glide off in straight paths. They slowly lose altitude until encountering another thermal that will lift them. Both terrestrial and marine gliders have wings of considerable size. The wing length of some pelicans may reach 8 feet (240 cm) from tip to tip."},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"Flapping Flight M ost flying birds use flapping flight all the time. It consists of moving through the air as if rowing with the wings. With each flap (raising and lowering), the wing both sustains the bird in the air and pushes its body forward. There are different types of flapping flight and different rates of flapping. In general, the larger the bird, the more powerful and less frequent its flapping will be. Because flapping is an activity that consumes much energy, birds have adapted a variety of flight patterns: some, like hummingbirds, always flap their wings, whereas others alternate flapping with short-term gliding. The wing shape also varies according to the bird's needs. Birds that cover long distances have long, narrow wings; those that fly among trees have short, rounded wings. 2 1 The feet spread open before landing to provide more resistance and help the bird to slow down. Spread Ta i l Flapping Against the Wind Open Wings WIND Sliding WAVELIKE FLIGHT PATH THE HEAD Tilted backward to bring it closer to the center of gravity (between the wings) and attain balance THE LEGS remain at rest until landing. They stay very close to the body. THE CROP Made of elastic skin. It can hold food during flight. Landing requires reducing speed until the bird becomes motionless and settles. The bird faces the wind and spreads out its tail, wings, and alulae (bastard wings, characterized by their stiffness and growth from the first digit), while lifting up its body and extending its legs forward to increase the surface area in contact with the air. In addition, the bird flaps its wings intensely in the direction opposite to its flight. Everything works like an aerodynamic brake. Some birds—such as the albatross, with its long, narrow wings—tend to have problems slowing down. As a result, they are ungainly when landing on the ground, but on the water they are able to ski on their feet until coming to a stop. A Specialized Design Flapping flight is an activity that requires much effort. Therefore, birds must eat large amounts of food. A migrating swallow uses 4 kilocalories (4,000 calories) per 1.6 miles (2.5 km) of flight, whereas a small mammal needs only about 0.025 kilocalorie (25 calories) to travel the same distance. Ideal for high speeds, it consists of flapping the wings to gain height and then folding them in order to descend along the flight's trajectory. Afterward the bird flaps its wings again, making use of the inertia of its descent to regain height. A variation of this type of flight involves gliding between flaps of the wings. Ascent 2 Rest The bird keeps the wings near its body to save energy for short intervals. Descent 1 Propulsion The bird flaps its wings to ascend. Flapping Wings Folded-up Wings 8 WINDMILL FLIGHT: HUMMINGBIRDS Hummingbirds are able to hover in order to suck the nectar out of flowers. In contrast to other birds, hummingbirds' wings are attached only at the shoulders, which provides greater freedom of wing movement, allowing the hummingbird to hold itself in the air during both the upstroke and the downstroke. The hummingbird has to flap its wings up to 4,800 times per minute during directional flight and for hovering. The wings flap 80 times per second during normal flying. Diagram describing the movements of the tip of the wing during flight The wing has short, sturdy bones; the muscles are very powerful. Great Maneuverability: Hummingbirds are the only birds capable of moving backward. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Courtship Display Certain hummingbird species can flap their wings up to 200 times per second during courtship. 1 5 6 THE BILL Projected forward, its aerodynamic shape decreases the bird's air resistance. THE TAIL Slightly curved, it works as a rudder during flight and as a brake during landing. Muscular strength is distributed to the entire wing, but it increases near the tip. The downstroke of the wing provides propulsion. THE AVERAGE SPEED OF AN ADULT PELICAN DURING FLIGHT ON A WINDLESS DAY 30 Upstroke As the wings move upward, the remiges separate and form grooves to reduce friction. Support for the bird comes from the patagium, a layer of skin that anchors the feathers and covers the bones.

To survive, birds must prepare for the arrival of fall and winter and adjust their behavior accordingly. Gliding over the oceans, a wandering albatross, for example, can travel anywhere from 1,800 to 9,300 miles (2,900 to 15,000 km) in a single day in search of food. When the time comes to choose a partner, the behavior of males is different from that of females: males employ a variety of tactics to win over females and convince them of their fitness. Some bird couples stay together forever, whereas other birds change partners every year. As for caring for chicks and building nests, in most species both parents participate.

Sleep Regulator The pineal gland, or epiphysis, produces melatonin. The level of this hormone determines the phases of sleep and wakefulness. In early summer, incubation takes place. The increase in the amount of daylight coincides with this phase of the annual cycle. The amount of light increases with the beginning of spring; males use their huge throat pouches to court females. ANNUAL CYCLE Incubation, migration, and courtship activities vary according to the amount of light available during each season. + LIGHT - LIGHT +LIGHT Survival Manual Birds' most striking behaviors are associated with the reproductive season. During courtship parades, birds engage in elaborate choreographies; there are also extraordinary fights between males. The blue-footed booby, the male frigate bird, and the ruff are just a few examples of birds that engage in these behaviors. Others, such as the snowy egret (Egretta thula) , prefer to offer twigs for the construction of the nest. The Vogelkop bowerbird (Amblyornis inornata) builds bowers with leaves, flowers, or any other object that may help him to win over the female. Birds' performances are not connected only to courtship. The killdeer (Charadrius vociferus) fakes being wounded to defend the eggs or chicks in the nest from predators. It offers itself as easy prey by dragging a wing as if it were broken. This trick shifts the danger away from the young. Reproduction is the main activity under the control of the hypophysis, which determines behaviors such as finding a place to court females and mate, building a nest, incubating the eggs, and stimulating unborn chicks to break their shells. The hypophysis is a gland in the brain that has several functions. It receives nervous and chemical How the Hypophysis Works stimuli and produces hormones. These hormones regulate the metabolic activities that cause birds' internal and external sexual organs to develop. For example, the gonads become enlarged, and secondary sexual characteristics, such as ornamental crests or plumes, appear. 1 2 3 IN COMBAT In the summer, male ruffs develop a huge “ruff” and auricular feathers around their necks. Their courtships are violent and striking. When competing for mating territory, they struggle fiercely. Afterward they docilely sprawl their bodies on the ground until the female chooses the lucky one. THE MOST IMPORTANT GLAND The hypophysis is located in the ventral area of the brain, below the hypothalamus. Its secretions control vital functions, from blood pressure and the balance of water and salts in the body to the activity of the gonads and the thyroid. The magnificent frigate bird (Fregata magnificens) is a large bird that lives in coastal areas. It has large wings, powerful talons, and a strong hooked bill. During the reproductive season, it is responsible for building the nest. With its impressive appearance, it endeavors to attract a female. SHOWING OFF SUN 2 Parade It lowers its head and parades like a soldier around the nest. Finally, it shakes its whole body.

The migration season begins. BIRDS 43 42 THE LIVES OF BIRDS The Annual Cycle T he annual cycle of seasons is like the daily cycle of night and day. Fluctuations in the intensity of light over time create a series of physiological and behavioral changes in birds, whether throughout the year or throughout the day. This biological clock is clearly reflected in birds' reproduction and migrations. Changes in light that are detected by a bird's retinas induce the secretion of melatonin by the pineal gland. The blood level of this hormone acts on the hypothalamus-hypophysis axis, which regulates internal processes. This is one reason why birds start to change their plumage and feel the need to fly to other areas. TO THE ORGANS"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"EXPULSION OF AIR TO THE BRONCHI The air stored in the air sacs and lungs is expelled. As it passes through the syrinx (located between the bronchi and the trachea), it vibrates the tympaniform membranes. These membranes are the equivalent of vocal cords in humans. TRACHEA SYRINX BRONCHI DIVERTICULA TO THE PNEUMATIC BONES LUNGS AIR SACS 2 44 THE LIVES OF BIRDS BIRDS 45 How They Communicate S ound is an important form of expression in the lives of birds. Birds' sounds can be of two types: calls and songs. The former have a simple acoustic structure, with few notes. They are associated with coordinating the activities of a group, establishing communication between parents and their young, and maintaining contact between birds during migration. Songs, on the other hand, are more complex in rhythm and modulation. They are controlled by the sex hormones, primarily the male hormones. For this reason, males produce the most varied melodies. Songs are linked to sexual behavior and territorial defense. In general, birds either inherit or learn them. THE SONG AND THE BRAIN Birds have a brain that is well developed for this function. Testosterone acts on the upper vocal center of the brain, which is in charge of memorizing, identifying, and transmitting the orders for the execution of the song. THE PRODUCTION OF SOUND IN THE SYRINX The participation of both the sternotracheal muscles and five to seven pairs of small internal muscles is needed for producing sounds. These muscles control the elongation and contraction of the syrinx, which varies the pitch of the sound. The air sac is also important because it adds external pressure, which causes the tympaniform membranes to tighten. The esophagus works like a resonating box, amplifying the sound. The articulation of the sounds occurs in the buccopharyngeal cavity. There are two types of articulation: guttural and lingual. Territoriality and Range One of the most studied functions of birds' songs is territorial demarcation. When a bird occupies a territory, it sings to announce its claim to competitors, as the pipit shown to the left is doing. When birds must share territory, as in a colony, they develop dialects (variations of sounds produced by the species). When a bird born and raised in one location moves, it must learn the dialect of the new location in order to be accepted and participate in the community. There are also mechanical sounds produced by wing strokes, legs, and bills. In a display of territorial defense, the eared nightjar combines singing with beating its wings. HIGH VOCAL CENTER It is controlled by the central nervous system and orders the bird to sing. ROBUST NUCLEUS OF THE ARCHISTRIATUM It sends the information to the muscles of the syrinx. NUCLEUS OF THE HYPOGLOSSAL NERVE It controls the motor functions of the syrinx. CLOSED MEMBRANE The membranes close on both sides, under pressure from the external muscles.

A AIR AND BRONCHI During breathing, the songbird maintains airflow without affecting the resting syrinx. INTENSITY can vary widely from bird to bird. The larger the territory, the greater its reach. Its frequencies can change as well: the lower the frequency, the greater the coverage. Strengthening Ties Some songbirds develop very complex singing rituals. The duet is perhaps the most striking because it requires both a shared repertoire and good coordination between both birds. In general, the male initiates the song with a repeated introduction; the female then alternates with different phrasing. The phrasing allows for more or less cyclical variations that make it unique. It is believed that this strengthens ties between the pair (as demarcation of territory does) and serves as a stimulus for cooperative behaviors, such as nest building, in which both the male and female may participate.

For birds, the exhibition of plumage with bright colors, the presentation of offerings and gifts, and the performance of dances and highly elaborate flight patterns are some of the particular behaviors seen during this period. They are known as nuptial or courtship displays. The male resorts to all these strategic gestures to attract the female's attention and prevent her from paying attention to other males. Some of these rituals are extremely complicated; others are very tender and delicate. Monogamy or Polygamy Monogamy is the most common mating system, in which two birds, one of each sex, participate, leading to the formation of a couple. This couple can endure for a single reproductive season or for life. Polygamy is an alternative pattern, but it is not very common. Polygamy is divided into two classes: polygyny, in which the male mates with several females, and polyandry, in which the female mates with several males (and may even be able to keep them all together in a harem). In either case, one partner has the sole responsibility of caring for the eggs and chicks. There is also an exceptional case within polygamy: promiscuity. In this arrangement, a couple is not formed, and the relationship is limited to copulation. The courtship display is directly related to reproduction cycles. It takes place before copulation, although it can continue to occur thereafter. TIMING Great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus) perform incredible aquatic dances. They bow to each other, dive, and run through the water side by side. MUTUAL DANCES AND COURTSHIPS Certain birds, such as goshawks or male northern harriers, court the female in flight. They ascend in the air in broad circles, only to let themselves fall in daring, sharp dives. AERIAL EXHIBITIONS Another courtship strategy is the presentation of gifts. Male eagles give females prey, and European bee-eaters offer insects. These offerings are called courtship food. GIFTS To find a partner, birds such as the snowy egret resort to a series of very elaborate signals, such as songs, poses, dances, flight patterns, noisemaking, and displays of their ornamental feathers. DISPLAYING PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES Australian bowerbirds build a structure called a bower, which they decorate with pieces of paper and fabric that inevitably attract the female. BUILDING BOWERS Postnuptial With this display, the great crested grebe ensures the continuity of the pairing even after the eggs are laid. Prenuptial Prenuptial courtship starts with territorial establishment and the search for a partner, which can take place simultaneously. When its sexual arousal peaks, the male northern harrier (Circus cyaneus) flies in a wavelike pattern to attract the female. During courtship, the male northern harrier pretends to attack the female. A B Special Courtship Avian courtship is a phenomenon that, depending on the species, can take the form of various rituals. Lek rituals are one of the most intriguing forms of courtship. The males gather in a small area, called an arena, where they perform their courtship displays for the females. The females form a circle around the arena and end up mating with the male that has the most striking secondary sexual characteristics. Lek is a system controlled by the dominant male, who ends up mating with most of the females (polygyny). The less experienced males will mate with only a few, or even none, of the females. For some species, lek rituals can be very intricate. At least 85 species perform this special type of courtship ritual, among them manakins, pheasants, cotingas, and hummingbirds. Manakins, for example, stand in line and wait their turn to perform. Gray Crowned Crane Balearica regulorum Two cranes perform a courtship dance consisting of a series of impressive leaps.

They vary depending on the amount of warmth the species needs, as well as in terms of the level of protection they offer. The greater the pressure from predators, the higher or better hidden a nest must be. Good examples are isolated nests resembling high platforms; nests in deep depressions in the soil or hidden in tree trunks, which are very safe and provide good insulation; and nests made of clay, which are very hard. The most typical nests resemble a cup and are found at various locations, most often between two or three high, remote branches. LINING It is composed of fibers, hairs, feathers, and down. It insulates the eggs from the cold and helps with incubation. WALLS Eare the most important component in a nest's construction, and they give it its characteristic shape. The materials used vary, depending on the habitat. BASE This is the nest's foundation, and it is the first section built by the bird. It is solid and is usually built with bulkier materials. Structure The cup shape is important for preventing eggs from rolling out and falling. Besides making the construction of the nest easier, the use of different materials helps make the nest sturdier, as the smaller and more flexible pieces firm up the base, walls, and lining of the structure. Different materials also provide more efficient insulation, keeping warmth in and cold out during the incubation and raising of chicks. As an added reinforcement, birds usually make the side facing the prevailing winds thicker and the side facing the sun thinner. Thus, the whole nest is an incubator that conserves energy. Finally, an exterior finish camouflages the nest among branches, hiding it from predators. BASE The bird gathers branches and small sticks on a fork to lay the foundations of the nest, setting up a platformlike structure. The bird then ties it to the tree, making it sturdy. 1 WOVEN NESTS Weaver birds intertwine grass blades until they form a structure. The entrances are underneath. BURROWS Parrots and kingfishers dig their nests in sandy river banks. SEWN NESTS The tailorbird sews two large leaves together with grass blades. The nest is inside the leaves. PLATFORM NESTS The sparrow hawk gathers a large number of branches and assembles a high, solid base for its eggs. THE LITTLE MASKED WEAVER builds solid nests, weaving together leaves and grass blades. Sometimes the male builds several nests before the female chooses him. SOME VARIATIONS END The finish includes moss and feathers to smooth out the interior and provide insulation against the wind and cold, which makes the nest more suitable for incubation. 3 SHAPE The bird intertwines grass blades, small sticks, and hairs; fastens them; and gives them a circular shape. As construction advances, the bird uses adhesive materials, such as spiderwebs. 2 How the Nest Is Built A cup-shaped nest is built at a fork between two or three branches. The bird arranges twigs, grass blades, and small sticks, as if building a platform. The bird then interlaces some of these materials with the tree to give the nest solidity. It then interweaves the materials in a circular pattern. As the nest takes shape, lighter, more adhesive materials—such as mud, spiderwebs, caterpillar silk, and certain plant fibers—are used. Although the outside is rough, the inside is lined with feathers for softness and warmth. In general, if both the male and female participate in the construction, a few hundred trips are enough to complete the nest. In some species, such as weavers, males have to display a nest during courtship; in others (African black eagles, for instance), the same nest is used every year. 48 THE LIVES OF BIRDS Home Sweet Home M ost birds lay their eggs in a nest, where they are incubated by the body heat of an adult sitting on them. To build a nest, the couple normally uses mud mixed with saliva, small stones, branches, and feathers. When the nest is in a visible location, the bird covers it with lichens or loose twigs to hide it from predators. Nest shapes vary according to the bird group: they can take the form of a bowl, a hole in a tree (woodpeckers), or an excavated burrow on a slope of sand or soil. There are even birds that use nests built by other species. BIRDS S 49"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"BIRDS 51 50 THE LIVES OF BIRDS B irds may have inherited their reproductive method from their predecessors, the theropod reptiles. In general, they lay as many eggs as they can care for until the chicks become independent. Highly adapted to the environment, the eggs of the same species have varying shapes and colors. These variations help keep them safe from predators. They also vary greatly in size: the egg of an ostrich is 2,000 times bigger than that of a hummingbird. First, the Egg THE SHELL Formed by a solid layer of calcium carbonate (calcite), it has pores that make it possible for the chick to breathe. Bacteria are kept out by two membranes that cover the egg, one on the inside and the other on the outside. 1 OVULES They lie in follicles arranged like a bunch of grapes. 2 DESCENT Once fertilized, the ovule travels down the oviduct until it reaches the isthmus. 3 SHELL In the isthmus, the shell membranes form. 4 UTERUS The egg becomes pigmented, and the shell hardens. 5 CLOACA It expels the egg 24 hours later on average (chicken hens). LAYING A group of eggs laid at one time is called a laying. During the mating season, a sparrow can have several layings. If some eggs are removed, the sparrow can replace them without difficulty. Light Egg Dark Egg Speckled Egg SIZE There is no exact proportion between the size of a bird and its egg. The bill and scales of the legs harden toward the end, when the chick is formed and reaches a size similar to that of the egg. At that point, rotation begins so that the chick will be positioned to break its shell. 4 When the chick is ready to break the shell, it is taking up all the space inside the egg. The chick is cramped with its legs against its chest. This enables it to open the shell with small movements and with the help of a hard point at the tip of its bill (called an egg tooth). 5 Most birds' organs are formed in the first hours of incubation. 3 The egg contains an embryo in one side of the yolk. The yolk is held in the middle of the white (albumin) by a protein cord that isolates it from the outside world. 1 How It Forms Birds have only one functional ovary, the left one, which grows dramatically during the mating season. The ovule can descend and form what are known as unfertilized eggs (the type used in cooking). If the egg is fertilized, embryonic development begins. The ovule, fertilized or not, descends to the cloaca in a few hours or days. The eggshell begins to be formed at the isthmus, through the secretion of calcium. At first soft, the shell hardens when it comes in contact with the air.

In general, the parents do not intervene or help their young. When the shell is empty, they throw it out of the nest, apparently to avoid attracting the attention of predators. In species whose young hatch with the feathers already developed, hatching is extremely important. It has been observed that the singing of the chicks stimulates the stragglers and delays those that have gotten ahead; it is important that they all be ready to leave the nest together. BIRDS 53 52 THE LIVES OF BIRDS Birth in Detail W hen a chick is about to hatch, it starts to make itself heard from inside the egg. This allows it to communicate with its parents. It then starts to peck at the shell with its tiny egg tooth, which is lost after birth. Next, it turns inside the egg and opens a crack with new perforations, at the same time pushing with its neck and legs until it manages to stick out its head. This job demands a lot of effort and can take 30 to 40 minutes or, in the case of kiwis and albatrosses, even three to four days. In most species, newborn chicks are blind and naked, and they can open their bills only to receive food. BROOD PATCH Adaptations for Hatching Getting out of the egg is an intricate operation because the space is tight, and a chick's muscles have little vigor. Birds count on a few adaptations, such as the egg tooth and the hatching muscle, to accomplish the task. The tooth is used for making the first perforation, which allows air into the egg. The muscle exerts the necessary strength, while stimulating the chicken's motor functions to intensify the effort. Both the egg tooth and the hatching muscle disappear shortly after the eggshell is broken. HATCHING MUSCLE It exerts pressure against the shell and helps to break it. For the embryo to develop, it needs constant temperatures between 99° and 100° F (37-38° C). The parents ensure these temperatures by sitting on the eggs and warming them with their brood patches. INCUBATION ASKING FOR HELP The chick calls for its parents from inside. The reply encourages it to continue the effort. During incubation, some species lose their chest feathers and increase their number of blood vessels in this area. Others pluck out their feathers. Direct contact with the eggs helps keep them warm. CRACK IN THE EGG The chick turns inside until its bill targets the egg's midline. It then punctures the air sac. With a few more tries, it pierces the shell. The chick then breathes for the first time. 1 THE CRACK EXPANDS After making a hole in the shell, the chick opens a crack with successive pecks at other points. Air gets in and dries up the membrane, which makes the task easier. 2 GETTING OUT OF THE EGG Once the shell is open, the chick pushes itself out with its legs and by crawling on its abdomen. For birds that hatch without feathers, this is more difficult, because they are less developed. 3 4 EGGSHELL SHELL MEMBRANE DURATION BY SPECIES The incubation period varies considerably: between 10 and 80 days, depending on the species. PENGUIN Both males and females incubate. The emperor male has a special pouch for incubation. PIGEON Females and males incubate. They both develop a brood patch. ALBATROSS Lacking brood patches, the parents hold the egg between their feet and abdomen. 80 days 62 days 18 days WHAT COMES OUT FIRST? The head usually comes out first, because the sharp bill helps break the shell. Most birds then get out of the egg by pushing themselves out with their legs. For wading birds and other terrestrial birds, however, the wings usually unfold first. EGG TOOTH A protuberance on the bill that punctures the egg. Its presence depends on the species. A GREAT EFFORT Getting out of the shell requires much energy from the chick. THE CHICK IS BORN Once outside the chick, almost featherless, looks for warmth and food from its parents. In the case of some birds that hatch without feathers, not all eggs hatch simultaneously; this benefits the firstborn if food is scarce. 35 minutes IS THE APPROXIMATE TIME IT TAKES A SPARROW TO COME OUT OF THE EGG. SEQUENCE OF PECKING Between each sequence of pecking, the chick must take long breaks."},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"BIRDS 55 54 THE LIVES OF BIRDS C hicks develop at highly variable rates after hatching. Some birds are born with their eyes open and with a thick layer of down feathers. These birds can also feed themselves. That is why they are called precocious, or nidifugous. Ducks, rheas, ostriches, and certain beach birds can walk and swim as soon as they are born. Other species are born naked and develop their feathers later. They need to stay in the nest until they have sufficiently developed, so adult birds must care for them. These birds are called nidicolous. The most helpless chicks are the young of songbirds and hummingbirds, because they need warmth from their parents to grow strong. Nidifugous Young Nidifugous young are fully developed at the moment of birth. They can move and even leave the nest, hence their name (which means “fleeing the nest”). This adaptation demands more incubation time because the chick is almost fully developed at birth. This is the case with incubator birds (Megapodius freycinet) , which begin their independent lives in the outside world as soon as they leave the shell. Ducks follow their parents but find food on their own, whereas chickens follow their parents, and the parents show them where to find food. Nidicolous Broods Most of these chicks are born naked, with closed eyes and with only enough strength to get out of their shells. They stay in the nest. For the first few days, they cannot even regulate their own body temperature; they need their parents in order to stay warm. Within one week, they have a few feathers, but they require constant care and food. They form a numerically important group that includes Passeriformes (songbirds). FOOD They need much food to develop. The parents must feed them 24 hours a day. 25 hours It performs a few instinctive movements. It can barely raise its head to ask for food. 30 hours The chick keeps warm with the down that covers its body. It can walk and begins to be fed by its parents. 7 to 8 days Growth quickens, and the first covert feathers appear at the tip of the wing. The bird leaves the nest. Its diet consists of: 15 days It starts to perform short flights. It reverses its diet, eating: 21 days It is already considered an adult. Its flights are longer. Its diet is composed of 97 percent vegetables; the rest is made up of lichens and insects. 8 days Feathers cover the chick almost completely, except around its eyes. Its legs are well developed, and the sparrow moves around in the nest. 10 days Feathers cover everything, but they are not yet developed. The chick can stay warm on its own, and it is voracious. Growth is very fast. 12-15 days Development is complete, and the covert feathers are ready for flight. All that remains is for the bird to reach adult size. 6 days Some feathers begin to unfold, the nails are formed, and the wings continue to grow with the body. It can stand up. 4 days The eyes open. The tips of the first feathers appear. It performs a few movements. EYES Nidicolous chicks are born blind. They open their eyes a few days after birth. INTERIOR OF THE BILL Its color is bright to stimulate the parents to regurgitate the food. Some species have shiny areas that can be seen even in the dark. Shining Areas They lay small eggs, with a brief incubation period, and the young are helpless at birth.

It is very high in energy and easy to digest. In order to get it, a bird must have a long, sharp bill. In temperate regions, nectar is plentiful in the spring and summer, whereas in the tropical regions, it is available year round. Hummingbirds and honeycreepers are very fond of this juice.  THE HUMMINGBIRD'S TONGUE Long channeled or tubular tongues suck the nectar and catch insects at the bottom of the corolla of a flower. SEEDS AND GRAINS The high energy and protein content of seeds make them an ideal food for birds. The problem is that they are seasonal. FRUIT In the tropics, this diet is very common because fruits are available throughout the year. In temperate and cold regions, fruit can be found only in the summer. Fruit has a high energy value, and many birds eat it. MEAT Hunting and scavenging birds feed on meat. They rarely specialize in one type of prey, but the prey's size determines its selection. LEAVES AND PLANTS Few birds feed on leaves because they have low energy value. Birds that do have undergone adaptations that permit them to digest cellulose. FISH The abundance of fish throughout the year makes them one of the favorite foods of marine birds. They have a high nutritional value. INSECTIVORES Insects are rich in energy and proteins, and they are highly abundant. Thus, many bird species eat them. In cold regions, they can be found only in the summer. TOGETHER This behavior is typical of ocean birds, such as pelicans and seagulls, and of aquatic birds, such as flamingos. When birds eat in groups, each group member can warn the others about possible dangers, which is beneficial. SOLITARY Usually birds of prey, such as eagles and owls, hunt alone because food is scarce and is randomly distributed. Hunting alone has a drawback in that birds must also watch out for predators, which takes time away from hunting. It is given to the young through the bill. Easy to digest and nutritious, it is an excellent food. TONGUE LAMELLAE 2. This milk has high concentrations of the pigment that colors the feathers; that is why the bird's color changes to the characteristic pink while molting in adolescence. M ost birds eat assorted foods that are rich in energy and proteins. Their high level of activity requires that they eat almost constantly. Their sources of food are varied and include seeds, fruits, nectar, leaves, insects and other invertebrates, and meat of all kinds (including carrion). Many species eat more than one type of food; some even alternate according to the seasons and to the migration cycle. This guarantees their survival. However, there are others birds—a minority—that consume only one type of food, for which they have no competition. Because their dependence on this single source of food is greater, though, the risk is higher. Feeding behavior also varies among different species. For example, some eat alone, and others eat in groups. Lamellae Tongue LOWER MANDIBLE UPPER MANDIBLE WATER IN MOTION A second filtration occurs inside the bill, as the water is expelled. The lamellae (small plates) catch the microorganisms but let water and other matter pass. 3 Hooks to Hold the Bill Pointed tips, in the shape of brushes The flamingo submerges its bill in the briny water to feed on the microorganisms living there. 1 The flamingo fills its bill with water by raising its tongue. By doing this, the flamingo performs an initial filtration that keeps out undesired substances. 2 The flamingo produces milk in its crop only when it is not eating. A protein called prolactin participates in its preparation, just as with mammals. 1. Cross-Section of the Bill Filtration of Food A Complex System Feeding on microorganisms that live in salty water demands a complex filtration system. The flamingo's bill is specially suited to this task. Its tongue and throat pump the water inside the bill as they ascend and descend, bringing water through the hornlike lamellae, which resemble whale baleen, to retain the food passing through them. Their tongues also have a depressed area, where the stones and sediments that come in with the water collect. The whole operation requires that the flamingo submerge its bill upside down. Because of the number of microorganisms they need to consume and the time it takes to filter them, flamingos usually spend many hours in the water. The risks involved in this activity are mitigated by the fact that flamingos do not eat alone, but rather in groups. Occasionally, there are instances of aggression, possibly because of territorial conflicts. From Parents to Children Flamingos and pigeons feed their young a special “milk” that is produced in the crop and has a nutritional value similar to the milk of mammals. Both males and females produce it as soon as food is ingested so that the chick is not fed regurgitated food. 3. Strategies Depending on the abundance of resources, the needs of the species, and the strategies for getting food, birds may eat alone or in groups. If food is scarce or widely scattered throughout a region, birds eat alone and defend their territory. On the other hand, if food is abundant, they prefer to eat within the safe confines of the group. Types of Diet Birds expend a great deal of energy, and their diet must be suited to their high metabolic rates. They eat practically anything, although the diet of some birds is very specific. The same foods are not always available, which causes most birds to adjust their diets throughout the year. BIRDS 57"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"How They Find Their Way Around Birds use a compass-and-triangulation system that lets them know where they are according to the position of the sun or stars. This system is similar to the one used by seafarers. It consists of measuring the sun's angle of inclination in relation to the horizon (azimuthal angle) and comparing it to the angle the bird knows through its biological clock. Birds also orient themselves by using the Earth's magnetic field. Furthermore, those migrating during the day register landmarks on their routes, such as mountains, lakes, or deserts. Still others follow older birds or are guided by their sense of smell. 58 THE LIVES OF BIRDS BIRDS 59 Behavior In order to survive, millions of birds from all over the world start a journey every fall in search of better climates. The instinct of migrating, which other animals share with birds, was acquired after a long evolutionary process. Some birds fly thousands of miles through mountain ranges; others follow the course of a river without stopping until they reach their destination; others land after a short trip. In general, birds undergo physiological changes that are related to the length of their journey; some even lose almost half their weight during the migration. Routes tend to be fixed, although some migratory birds do not always follow them exactly. The colors on the map indicate the most important routes. There are collective and individual migrations, and birds may travel during the day or at night. It is surprising how fast birds travel. Many studies have recorded that carrier pigeons and white-headed sparrows can cover more than 600 miles (1,000 km) in a day. Shorebirds, such as godwits and curlews, are among the birds that cover the most distance. They are also among the birds most faithful to routes. Longitudinal Latitudinal Altitudinal Types of Migration The north-south path traveled by many species is called latitudinal migration. A second pattern, which occurs in an east-west direction, is called longitudinal migration. The last pattern is called altitudinal migration; it is performed by birds that move up and down mountains seasonally.

To defend themselves against these predators, birds use various strategies, the most common of which is camouflage. Some birds blend in with their surroundings and thus go unnoticed by their enemies. Chaparrel birds, whose plumage colors and patterns make them difficult to discern when they are on the ground, use this strategy. Other birds take flight in the face of a threat. There are also those that keep still in the presence of unknown animals, feigning death, whereas others face an enemy and fight. It is not uncommon to see magpies, thrushes, and other birds chasing away strangers that get close to their nests. BIRDS 61 Individual Strategies Among solitary birds, it is common to flee quickly if a stranger is present. Not all solitary birds react this way, though; some have developed specific techniques to defend themselves. ESCAPE In the presence of terrestrial predators, a bird's first reaction is to take flight. If the bird cannot fly, it looks for shelter or a hiding place. EXPANSION Owls spread out their wings to look bigger than they really are. DISTRACTION Little bustards shoot their excrement in the face of birds that prey on them. This distracts the predator and makes it possible to escape. CAMOUFLAGE is very common and is one of the most efficient defensive strategies. Many birds develop plumage to imitate the dominant colors and shapes of the environment where they live. When they notice the presence of a potential enemy, they stay motionless to avoid calling attention to themselves. There are a few notable cases, such as that of the tawny frogmouth (Podargus strigoides) , pictured above. Many partridges and terrestrial birds are experts at the art of blending in with the landscape; the rock ptarmigan, for example, has white plumage in the winter that becomes terra-cotta in the summer. Collective Strategies Birds that have group behaviors usually develop group strategies to protect themselves against predators. Being numerous is a guarantee that the species will go on. They also adopt other tactics as a group. COLONIES A great number of birds can defend themselves better from predators when in groups. For that reason they even form colonies with other bird species when raising their young. FLOCK In the presence of predators, birds form flocks that fly in a synchronized manner, which makes it hard for the predators to focus on any one individual. ATTACKS AND COLLECTIVE AID Many birds that live in groups have developed several hounding behaviors in the presence of potential enemies. They perform them to help an individual that is in danger or is unable to flee. WARNING They emit callings that warn the whole colony. The great majority of species have a specific and characteristic cry that is usually simple, brief, and very audible. They often emit these warnings while adopting postures (such as stretching the neck or shaking the wings) that alone are enough to warn other individuals of the intruder's presence. Defense of the Brood Hatching and youth are times of critical vulnerability for birds. During these phases, they are forced to keep still because they are easy prey. For this reason, parents permanently watch over their nests, even attacking strangers if they get too close. TO DEFEND ITSELF from the falcon's attack, a flock of starlings squeezes together in a dense formation. If they are near a tree, they do not hesitate to hide in it. FEIGNING INJURY A very widespread behavior is to pretend to be wounded or sick. This allows a bird to avoid being chosen as prey. This behavior is common among warblers, partridges, and pigeons. PROTECTION When a parent detects danger, it gets close to its young and covers them so that they are not alone. This behavior is common among tropical birds (tropical seabirds). Several species of curlews and sandpipers place their young between their legs, whereas grebes carry their chicks on their backs when swimming. ATTACK In other situations, birds adopt openly aggressive behaviors in the presence of intruders or predators. Magpies can even hound and chase away eagles if the latter threaten their brood. Such active defenses are more common among birds of prey. 1 2 3"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"FRESHWATER BIRDS 72-73 ARMED TO HUNT 74 -7 5 TALKATIVE AND COLORFUL 76-77 THE PERCHERS CLUB 78-79 Diversity and Distribution T he environment in which an organism usually lives is called its habitat. In their habitats, birds find food, the best places to build nests, and escape routes in case of danger. An almost universal pattern of distribution shows that more species live in the tropics than elsewhere. With evolution, birds with a common origin have diversified as they have begun to occupy different environments. This phenomenon is called adaptive radiation. We find ocean birds, which have undergone many changes in order to live near the sea, as well as birds that live in freshwater environments, in forests, and so on. Each type has acquired special physical traits and behaviors as a result of the adaptive process.

Ancient peoples grouped birds according to practical traits and mystical beliefs. They used birds as food or considered them to be bad omens or symbols of good luck. The people who developed scientific thought created a classification system that took into consideration the external form as well as the behavior of these vertebrates; hence, the denominations predator, wading bird, and songbird were developed, among others. The most recent system of classification, which is based on genetic and evolutionary criteria, has generated a hierarchical organization of names that is constantly being updated. Chordata Aves PHYLUM CLASS ORDER FAMILY GENUS SPECIES Vireonidae Hirundinidae Hirundo Hirundo rústica (barn swallow) Vireo olivaceus (red-eyed vireo) Vireo Larus atricilla (laughing gull) Larus Laridae What Is a Classification? Since the early Renaissance in the 16th century, scientific classifications assigned compound names to birds, as well as to other living creatures. The first part stands for a genus and the second for a specific name. Thus, the rock (domestic) pigeon is called Columba livia in scientific terms. The discovery of new species in different parts of the world widened the array of birds so that compound names were no longer enough. The level of family was established to group genera of birds that share similar traits. In turn, bird families that share common traits were grouped into orders. These were then combined into a category called class. Classes include all current and extinct birds. Birds share a higher category in the hierarchyΩthe phylumΩ with fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and vertebrates in general. Passeriformes Charadriiformes HOATZIN Opisthocomus hoazin is a tropical bird species that inhabits the Amazon. The presence of talons on the chicks' heels links them to their earliest ancestors, including Archaeopteryx. Diversity and the Environment Living birds are distributed among a wide variety of habitats. They can be found in aquatic (freshwater or marine) and aero-terrestrial environments. Marine birds live on cliffs, on islands, or in mangrove swamps. They are excellent fishers, and they use seashores or crannies between rocks as refuges for nesting. In freshwater bodies, such as rivers and streams, ducks feed on plants and surface microorganisms. Muddy shores are rich in insects and mollusks, which are the favorite dishes of ibis. Herons, storks, and egrets spear fish with their sharp bills as they wade in water with their long legs without getting wet. Forests, jungles, mountain ranges, and wide plains form most of the world's aero-terrestrial environments. In jungles and forests, predatory birds hunt their prey, while trogons and parrots gorge on insects and fruit. Rocky peaks are the refuge of condors, which fly for hours in search of the remains of dead animals. Ostriches run over prairies and savannas.

COUNTRIES WITH THE MOST SPECIES Palearctic Indian Ocean Atlantic Ocean Pacific Ocean NORTH AMERICA CENTRAL AMERICA SOUTH AMERICA AFRICA ASIA OCEANIA EUROPA W ith their mobility, birds have conquered all areas of the Earth. Despite this characteristic, there are few cosmopolitan species—that is, most birds have specific habitats determined by climate and geographic features. Count de Buffon in the 18th century was the first person to notice that living beings are not distributed homogeneously. By analyzing how animals were dispersed on the planet, he realized that different places had different types of fauna. After the work of naturalist Charles Darwin and ornithologist Philip Sclater, it became clear that organisms are situated in specific biogeographic regions. Biodiversity in the World The most diverse regions in terms of bird populations are the tropics because of the favorable conditions of abundant food and warm climate found in them. Temperate regions, however, with their seasons, are destinations for migrating birds from tropical and polar regions. Cold regions, on the other hand, have little diversity but are rich in population density. The rule is that diversity of life- forms happens in places where the environment requires less severe adaptations. Adaptations According to the Environment Birds are found in all habitats of the world, although most live in tropical regions. Their ability to adapt, however, is remarkable. From jungles to deserts, from mountains to coasts, and even on the sea, birds have succeeded in acclimating themselves. They have undergone a highly varied array of changes in form and behavior. Emperor penguins not only nest in Antarctica but they also incubate their eggs between their feet for 62 to 66 days. The male Lichtenstein's sandgrouse has developed a sponge of feathers to bring water to its chicks, and hummingbirds have special wings that enable them to make all sorts of maneuvers. 732 1,950 937 1,700 1,590 7 % HOATZIN Opisthocomus hoazin OSTRICH Struthio camelus PUFFIN Fratercula artica RUBY-THROATED HUMMINGBIRD Archilochus colubris Colombia Brazil Peru Ecuador Indonesia Bolivia Venezuela China India Mexico Democratic Republic of the Congo Tanzania Kenya Argentina 19 % 16 % 15 % 9 % More than 1,500 More than 1,000 3,370 32 % 187 2 % up to 200 200 - 400 400 - 600 600 - 800 800 - 1000 1000 - 1200 1200 - 1400 1400 - 1600 1600 - 1800 NUMBER OF SPECIES Pacific Ocean"},{"pageNumber":95,"pageContent":"68 DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION 5.9 ft (1.8 m) 4.6 ft (1.4 m) 1.3 ft (0.4 m) 3.9 ft (1.2 m) RHEIFORMES Rhea are common in South American countries, such as Argentina. They look like ostriches but are smaller. Their three-toed feet allow them to chase prey. Their long necks and excellent eyesight make them skillful hunters. APTERYGIFORMES Kiwis. These birds have four toes on each foot, and their feathers look like fur because they do not have barbules. They normally use their keen sense of smell to find insects at night. They lay only one large egg. CASUARIIFORMES Agile runners and swimmers. The colors on their necks and heads are distinctive. A bony hoof protects them from vegetation when they run. They have long, sharp talons on their feet. STRUTHIONIFORMES The ostrich is the only species in this group. It uses its wings for balance when running fast. It has only two toes on each foot. The adult male can weigh up to 330 pounds (150 kg). The Ratites Running birds belong to the group of the ratites ( rata = raft, an allusion to the flat sternum). The front limbs either are atrophied or have functions unrelated to flying. The hind limbs have very strong muscles as well as sturdy, vigorous bones. Another difference is found in the sternum. It is a flat bone without a keel, which flying and swimming birds possess. Wild ratites can be found only in the Southern Hemisphere. The Tinamidae, native to Central and South America, belong to this group (partridges). Super Swimmers Penguins' bodies are covered with three layers of small, overlapping feathers. A penguin has small limbs and a hydrodynamic shape that helps it swim with agility and speed. Dense, waterproof plumage and a layer of fat insulate the bird from the low temperatures of the regions where it lives. Since its bones are rigid and compact, it is able to submerge itself easily. This adaptation distinguishes it from flying birds, whose bones are light and hollow. PENGUIN HEADING TO THE WATER Other Walkers More than 260 species belong to the order Galliformes, which includes chickens, turkeys, and pheasants. The birds in this group have keels, and they perform abrupt and fast flights, but only in extreme situations. Their feet are suitable for walking, running, and scratching the ground. This group includes the birds that human beings use the most. In general, males are in charge of incubating and raising the young. BIRDS 69 No Flying Allowed A few birds have lost their ability to fly. Their main characteristic is wing loss or reduction, although for some a remarkable size may be the cause of their inability to fly. Such birds weigh more than 39 pounds (18 kg). This is the case with runners (ostriches, cassowaries, emus, rheas, kiwis), extremely fast birds that live in remote areas of New Zealand, and swimmers, such as penguins, that have developed extraordinary aquatic abilities. Running and Kicking Ostriches usually run to escape from predators or to hunt small lizards and rodents. In both cases, because of their strong legs, they are able to reach a speed of 45 miles per hour (72 km/h) and to maintain it for 20 minutes. When running is not enough to protect the bird, kicking is a valid recourse that discourages the attacker. In courtship displays, forceful stamping is also used to win over females.

To survive at sea, they have undergone multiple adaptations. For instance, marine birds have a more efficient excretory system than that of other species, including a specific gland that helps them eliminate excess salt. Most marine birds live on the coasts and have mixed behaviors; others are more aquatic than aerial. A few—such as albatrosses, petrels, and shearwaters—can fly for months at a time, landing only to raise their chicks. They are called pelagic birds. Central Excretory Canal Blood Circulation Circulation of Saline Solution Membrane To e Fourth To e TUBULAR NOSTRILS Albatrosses have one on each side of their bills. On petrels and shearwaters, the tubular nostrils have merged on top of the bill, forming a single nasal tube. Adaptations Marine birds are well prepared to live on water, especially those that fish out at sea. The tips of their bills are hook-shaped, and their feet have webbed membranes between the toes. They also have an admirable ability to float. The saline water is not a problem; these birds can even drink it. In some pelagic birds, sense of smell plays an important role in enabling them to detect the oil of the fish in the water to find schools of fish. They also use their sense of smell to find their nests in colonies. Fishing Methods Many marine birds fish by diving into the sea. This way, they can access fish that swim below the surface. In order to reach deeper levels in the water, they fly up several feet, spy a school, fold their wings, and plunge with their necks stretched forward. Thanks to the buoyancy of their feathers, they are back on the surface moments later. HERRING GULL Larus argentatus A voracious fisher and great glider. There are many species, some truly cosmopolitan. IMPERIAL SHAG Phalocrocorax atriceps This great coastal diver has solid bones and strong swimming feet. It does not oil its plumage so that it can better submerge. BROWN PELICAN Pelecanus occidentalis It stays on the shore. It uses its crop as a fishing net while it swims. VARIOUS MARINE BIRDS 148 feet (45 m) IS THE MAXIMUM DEPTH THEY REACH. COMMON LOONS—BIRDS INDIGENOUS TO NORTH AMERICA THAT SPEND THE WINTER AT SEA—HAVE BEEN RECORDED TO REACH THIS DEPTH. ALMOST UNABLE TO WALK, COMMON LOONS ARE EXCELLENT SWIMMERS AND DIVERS. THEY NEST AT INLAND LAKES DURING THE SUMMER. DIVE FISHING The bird dives to gain speed. It folds its wings and stretches out its neck to immerse itself in the water and reach the school of fish.` The bird immerses its body as much as possible to catch the fish; its feathers cause it to float back up. 1. 2. 3. CAPE GANNET Morus capensis Skillful spearfishers. They live in colonies in Africa. To help cool themselves, they have a strip of naked skin on their throats. Salt Gland Living in the ocean requires a few adaptations. The most notable one is the salt gland, which eliminates excess salt from the bloodstream. This way, marine birds can even drink salt water without suffering dehydration, as would be the case with humans. This gland is very efficient: it has been observed that 20 to 30 minutes after drinking a saline solution with concentrations similar to that of the ocean (4 percent), birds eliminate another solution (through the nostrils) with 5 percent salt, in the shape of water drops.

Freshwater birds live in rivers, lakes, and ponds for at least part of the year and are perfectly adapted to aquatic life. Some are excellent swimmers, whereas others are great divers. An important group wades in watercourses with long legs as they fish. Freshwater birds have a varied diet and are mostly omnivorous. Ducks and Distant Cousins The order Anseriformes includes birds that are very familiar to humans: ducks, geese, and swans, for example. They have short, webbed feet and wide, flat bills lined with lamellae (false teeth) that enable them to filter their food, catch fish, and scrape the beds of rivers and ponds. Most are omnivorous and aquatic (either staying on the surface or diving), although some species spend more time on land. They are widely distributed, and the plumage of males becomes very colorful during the courtship season. It swims on the surface, looking for food underneath the water. 1 It sticks its head into the water, abruptly pushes back its feet, and turns its neck downward. 2 It floats face-down and pokes the bottom with its bill. 3 IBIS ( Ibis sp.): Some filtrate, and others fish. STORK ( Ciconia sp . ): It fishes with its long bill. Shovel-Shaped Bill: Typical of many ducks. The size varies. Mandarin Duck Bill: One of the smallest-billed species. SHOEBILL ( Balae-niceps rex ): It eats among floating sedges. HERON ( Egretta sp.): It fishes with its sharp bill. COMMON SPOONBILL ( Platalea leucorodia ): It eats several types of aquatic animals. HAMMERKOP ( Scopus umbretta ): It fishes and hunts small animals. Muscovy Duck Cairina moschata White-Fronted Goose Anser albifrons Black-Necked Swan Cygnus melancoryphus Wading Birds These birds belong to an artificial order since, from a genetic perspective, the species are not related. They are grouped together because adaptation to the same habitat has caused them to develop similar shapes: long bills and necks to perform skillful movements and thin legs designed to wade across the water as they fish. Herons form a special group because they are cosmopolitan and because they have powder down feathers. Ibis and storks also have a wide distribution (area in which they occur). Birds that have spoon- and hammer-shaped bills are found primarily in Africa. 26 to 34 inches (66–86 cm) 10 to 13 inches (26–33 cm) 28 to 34 inches (70–85 cm) GREBE Podiceps sp .

They are very clumsy on the ground. In the Coraciiformes order, common kingfishers and other similar birds find their prey by closely watching the water. When one of these birds notices a small fish, it spears it, catching it with its bill. In the order Charadriiformes, curlews wander around the edges of ponds in search of food. Their long legs keep their bodies out of the water. They are not swimmers. THE BILL OF AN IBIS is long and thin, ideal to stick in the mud to look for food. THE LEGS OF AN IBIS keep the bird above the water but close enough to fish. Ibis also stir up the beds of lakes and ponds.

They are perfectly equipped to eat living animals. Their eyesight is three times sharper than that of human beings; their ears are designed to determine the precise status of their prey; they have strong, sharp talons; and they can kill a small mammal with the pressure of their talons alone. Their hook-shaped bills can kill prey by tearing its neck with a single peck. Eagles, falcons, vultures, and owls are examples of birds of prey. Birds of prey can be diurnal or nocturnal, and they are always on the lookout. BALD EAGLE Its hook-shaped bill is common to many birds of prey. FALCON It can break the spine of its prey with its upper bill. SPARROW HAWK Its thin bill enables it to take snails out of their shells. GOSHAWK Its strong bill can catch prey as large as hares. 5 miles (8 km) IS THE DISTANCE FROM WHICH A FALCON CAN PERCEIVE A PIGEON. Diurnal and Nocturnal Eagles, falcons, and vultures are diurnal birds of prey, whereas owls are nocturnal—that is, they are active during the night. These two groups are not closely related. These birds' main prey includes small mammals, reptiles, and insects. Once they locate the victim, they glide toward it. Nocturnal birds of prey are specially adapted: their eyesight is highly developed, their eyes are oriented forward, and their hearing is sharp. The feathers on their wings are arranged in such a way that they make no noise when the bird is flying. In order to protect themselves while sleeping during the day, they have dull plumage, which helps them blend in with their surroundings. HOW THE VULTURE HUNTS Bills The bills of birds of prey are hook- shaped. Some birds of prey have a tooth that works like a knife, allowing them to kill their prey, tear its skin and muscle tissues, and get to the food easily. The structure and shape of the bills of birds of prey changes depending on the species. Scavengers (for example, vultures and condors) have weaker bills because the tissues of animals in decomposition are softer. Other species, such as falcons, catch prey with their talons and use their bills to finish it off with a violent stab to the neck, breaking its spine. TIP Where the tooth is located NOSTRIL Olfactory canals Most birds of prey catch and kill their prey with their talons and tear away the meat with their bills. For this reason, birds' feet constitute one of the morphological characteristics of a species. The toes end in strong, sharp nails that the bird uses as pincers to catch its prey in flight. The osprey also has thorns on the soles of its feet, which help it to catch fish. Feet BALD EAGLE Haliaeetus leucocephalus It has a visual field of 220 degrees and a bifocal vision of 50 degrees. DIMENSIONS The wings of birds of prey are adapted to suit their flying requirements. They can measure up to 10 feet (3 m). Condors 3 to 9.5 ft (0.95–2.9 m) Eagles 4.5 to 8 ft (1.35–2.45 m) Buzzards 4 to 5 ft (1.2–1.5 m) Kites 2.6 to 6.4 ft (0.8–1.95 m) Red-Backed Hawk 3.4 to 4.4 ft (1.05–1.35 m) Falcons 2.2 to 4.1 ft (0.67–1.25 m) 1 Vultures feed mainly on carrion, although they are able to attack a living animal if it is vulnerable and the situation presents itself. Thanks to their ability to glide on thermals, vultures can find carcasses on which to feed without wasting energy. Once they find food, they must analyze the territory to know if they will be able to take flight again soon. 2 3 EURASIAN EAGLE OWL Bubo bubo Its ears are asymmetrical and can determine the location of prey with great precision.

Parrots also have a curved profile, a pointed tip on their upper mandible, and sharp edges on their lower one. These adaptations are practical when it comes to cutting and breaking fruits and seeds. The largest species like fruits with shells, such as walnuts, hazelnuts, and peanuts. The smaller ones prefer nectar and pollen, which they obtain with the help of brush-shaped bristles on their tongues. Their ability to imitate the human voice has made them very popular. However, they are far from being able to produce language. In reality, they are merely good imitators: they use their excellent memory to imitate sounds. They do this when they are hungry or when they detect the presence of unknown people. UPPER AND LOWER MANDIBLES The hook-shaped bill is flexible; the mandibles are joined to the skull by hinges. At its base, the upper mandible has a fleshy protuberance called a cere. NOSTRILS They are located at the base of the bill's upper portion. UPPER PART OF THE BILL It is where the most pressure is exerted and fruits are torn open. HOOKED BILL HOOK Sharp projection used to open seeds The Feet are referred to as zygodactyl. This means that two toes project forward and two project backward. Parrots appear to strut because their feet have a tibiotarsus that is shorter than that of other birds. FEATHERS AND COLORS They have tough and lustrous plumage. An abundance of green feathers helps them to hide among the leaves. In South America, the array of colors includes hues of blue, yellow, and red. P arrots form a very attractive bird group with a great capacity for learning. This group comprises cockatoos, macaws, and parakeets. They share physical characteristics, such as a big head, a short neck, a strong hook-shaped bill, and climbing feet. They have plumage in many colors. Toucans and woodpeckers share with parrots the colors of their feathers and their type of feet. Toucans have a wider, thicker bill, but it is light. Woodpeckers are climbing birds with a strong, straight bill, a tail of stiff feathers, and a distinctive crest. They form numerous groups, and most nest in trees. COMPARISON American parrots vary in size, from the monk parakeet (Myopsitta monachus) , which is 12 inches (30 cm) tall, to the hyacinth macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) from South America, which is 33 inches (1 m) tall.

Songbirds form the most numerous and varied group; it includes swallows, goldfinches, canaries, vireos, and ravens. PERCHING FOOT Three toes project forward, and the well-developed hallux projects backward. This type of foot allows the bird to hold on tightly to branches. HARD, SHORT BILL The bill of a swallow is very short and tough. The swallow can use it to catch insects in flight. SINGER This blue-and-white swallow (Notiochelidon cyanoleuca) intones its pleasant and trilling chant while it flies or when it alights. Larks, goldfinches, canaries, and other passerines delight us with their trills and sounds. 78 DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION SYRINX This sound-producing organ is located at the end of the trachea. The muscles in the syrinx move the bronchial walls, which, as the air passes through, produce the melodic sounds that characterize songbirds. BIRDS 79 The Perchers Club P asserines—or Passeriformes, the scientific name—form the widest and most diverse order of birds. What distinguishes them? Their feet are suited for perching and, therefore, for living among trees, although they can also stroll on the ground and through the brush. They inhabit terrestrial environments all over the world, from deserts to groves. Their complex sounds and songs originate from a very well-developed syrinx. Their chicks are nidicolous—that is, naked and blind at birth. In their youth, they are agile and vivacious, with very attractive, abundant, and colorful plumage. Passerines are small in comparison with other birds. Their size varies from 2 inches (5 cm) (bee hummingbirds, Mellisuga helenae ) to 7 inches (19 cm) ( Chilean swallow , Tachycineta leucopyga ) to 26 inches (65 cm) (common raven, Corvus corax ). THE SMALLEST HUMMINGBIRDS 2 in (5 cm) They get so much energy from nectar that they can double their body weight by eating. However, they use this energy up during their frantic flights. LIVING AT THE EXTREMES They range from one hemisphere to the other. They raise their chicks in the north and fly to the south to spend winter there. They fly all the way to Tierra del Fuego. Their sense of direction is remarkable. They can find and reuse their nests after returning from a migration. RAVENS 26 in (65 cm) They eat everything: fruits, insects, reptiles, small mammals, and birds. They are skillful robbers of all kinds of food. 50 % THE PERCENTAGE OF BIRDS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THE ORDER PASSERIFORMES A B Passerines have been classified into 79 families, with more than 5,400 different species. PASSERIFORMES BIRDS Syringeal Cartilage Tracheal Ring Bronchial Muscles Bronchial Ring OVENBIRDS AND THEIR RELATIVES Their nests are completely covered structures, similar to ovens. Other members of this family build nests with leaves and straw, weaving interesting baskets. Still others dig tunnels in the ground. WIDE BILLS They are native to Africa and Asia and inhabit tropical zones with dense vegetation. They eat insects and fruits. They produce nonvocal sounds with the flapping of their wings. They do this during courtship, and the sound can be heard 200 feet (60 m) away. LYREBIRDS There are only two species of these Passeriformes, and they are found only in Australia. They are very melodic and are excellent imitators of other birds. They can even imitate the sound of inanimate objects, such as horses' hooves. In the summer, during the reproductive season, they live in the Northern Hemisphere on the American continent. In general, neotropical migratory birds are those that reproduce above the Tropic of Cancer. A When winter arrives in the Northern Hemisphere, they perform a mass migration to the south, occupying the Caribbean and South America. The barn swallow travels 14,000 miles (22,000 km) during its migratory trip from the United States to southern Argentina.

Because of these qualities, they have fascinated human beings throughout history. Some species, such as eagles, have played an important role in world literature because of their aggressiveness and beauty. Some birds have also been assigned symbolic meanings: doves, which currently represent peace, are one example. Human beings have also been able to make use of birds. In the past, they were often used by sailors to find land, and in other cases they were trained to hunt. FENGHUANG was the messenger bird of Xi Wangmu, goddess of fertility and eternity in ancient China. A detail of a painting in the caves of Mogao, Dunhuang, China, is pictured above. QUETZAL Pictured above is a detail of a Mayan ceramic piece featuring quetzals, Mesoamerican birds with long green tails, from which, according to myth, the god Quetzalcóatl took his clothing and name: “feathered serpent.” HORUS, THE FALCON, is an important god in Egyptian mythology. His eyes represent the sun and the moon, and together with Seth he watches over the boat of Ra, which carries the dead away on the Nile. Bird Symbolism Throughout history and across cultures, human beings have used birds to symbolize several concepts. The fascination that their flight creates was a source of inspiration for such interpretations. Today the strongest and most widespread association is that of the flight of birds with freedom. In distant times (and in not so distant times), however, birds have represented many other things, from fertility and happiness, with their spring songs, to deep mourning, in the case of crows and vultures. Wisdom has been associated with owls, and shrewdness with crows. According to a certain modern tale, storks are responsible for bringing babies, and eggs are the universal symbol of gestation. Dressing Up in Feathers Almost all cultures have used bird feathers for decorative and ritualistic purposes. Their use as ornaments extended to North and South America, Africa, and the Western Pacific. North American indigenous peoples featured them on their war outfits, Hawaian kings wore them on their royal costumes, and the Mayans and Aztecs used them in works of art. Rites and Beliefs Birds have long enjoyed a prominent place in religion—first as totems and then as iconic representations of gods. Many religions have featured deities with the wings or heads of birds. Birds were also celestial messengers, and the future was interpreted through their flights. The crow was Apollo's messenger in ancient Greece; the Maya and Aztecs had Quetzalcóatl, their supreme god, who was named after the quetzal (a brightly colored Central American bird); and the Egyptians represented their fundamental god Horus with a falcon. Falconry This practice originated in Asia, in the homeland of the nomadic Mongols—descendants of Genghis Khan—where, to this day, it is commonly used as a form of subsistence by part of the population. It consists of using birds of prey (mainly falcons) to hunt. Trained birds are typically carried, hooded, and perched on their masters' arms. When released, they fly at high altitudes looking for prey, and then dive toward the ground to hunt it. They carry the prey back to their masters, who reward them with food. The basic training process takes a little over a month and a half. COMPETITOR BIRDS When birds share a habitat with humans, they often compete for resources (light, water, space, and nutrients). This is the case with birds that feed on cultivated crops. Urban areas, which have buildings that offer good nesting sites, attract many birds. This fact can be commonly observed in squares and open spaces, where pigeons and sparrows form veritable flocks. GLOVE TRANSMITTER FALCON LASH STRAPS HOOD NORTH AMERICAN INDIGENOUS MAN wearing a war costume covered with feathers PIGEON Sometimes their numbers in urban areas become excessive. DOVE Doves currently stand for peace, but in ancient Greece, Syria, and Phoenicia, they were used as oracles. In Mesopotamia and Babylon, they embodied fertility. For Christians, they symbolize the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary. EAGLE In Greek mythology, it was the symbol of Zeus. The Romans used it on their legions' banners. For many native North American cultures, it represented war, and it was the emblem of feudal lords and emperors. Today it is the national symbol of Mexico and the United States. SPARROW The sparrow is one of the birds best adapted to the urban environment. ELEMENTS Birds and masters wear specific clothes.

Ornithologists and a great number of bird lovers, who enthusiastically want to know more about these creatures, carry out the task methodically and patiently. They observe, analyze, and register birds' sounds, colors, movements, and behavior in their natural environments. To undertake this fieldwork, they develop methods and techniques and use technological resources to track specimens and learn about what happens to them during given times of the year. NASAL MARKERS These are colored, numbered plastic disks placed on the bill. They are fastened to the nasal orifices of aquatic birds. NECK MARKERS When placed appropriately, necklaces are effective markers with few adverse effects on geese, swans, or other aquatic birds with long necks. CAMERA WITH ZOOM LENS A camera with a powerful lens provides the opportunity to record details that simple cameras cannot. BINOCULARS They make it possible to see details in color and shape without disturbing the birds. Their usefulness depends on the power of their lenses. STUDIES Many studies on anatomy, physiology, and genetics of different bird species are carried out in laboratories. WORK CLOTHES Although seemingly a small detail, clothes can be a hindrance. They should be comfortable and soft, appropriate for the weather, and of colors that blend into the environment. TAPE RECORDER Recording birds' noises and songs makes it possible to distinguish among birds. Experts can identify species by listening to their recordings. BIRDS 85 Direct Observation Observing in a bird's natural habitat provides much information. For the greatest success, bird-watchers typically place themselves in front of rocks or trees in order not to form a silhouette. An alternative technique is to create a hiding place, such as a hollow cardboard rock. In both cases, the watcher needs to be facing away from the sun and must be prepared to stay for a long time. Catching Birds The Marking of Captured Birds This technique provides data on migration, survival, and reproduction rates, among other data. The bird should not suffer adverse effects in its behavior, longevity, or social interactions. Under no circumstances should this procedure hurt a bird. To avoid hurting birds, rings are designed to be placed on them rapidly and easily, yet to stay in place until the research is completed. MIST NET These fine nets are usually placed over swamps or marshes, and they can catch small birds. Once the birds are identified with a ring or some other tag, they are set free. HELIGOLAND TRAP It consists of a large barbed- wire funnel or corridor that ends in a box. Birds caught like this are tagged so that they can be monitored and studied later on. PAINTS AND DYES Birds that visit environments with dense vegetation are normally marked with nontoxic colorings on the feathers of their highest and most visible body parts. Scientists take advantage of molting to study penguins. When they are changing plumage, these birds stand on their legs, which makes it difficult to place or observe any rings on their legs. Instead, strips are placed around their wings, or electronic chips are implanted in their skin. The latter technique is less harmful because it does not potentially hinder the animal. CANNON NETS These nets are “shot” over birds using cannons or rockets. They unroll and catch birds as they are eating or resting. They are used to catch large birds. RINGED Numbered aluminum rings are used. When placing one on a bird, one should make sure that it slides and turns around the tibiotarsus to avoid hurting the bird or causing it to change its activity. WING MARKERS They are very visible and can be codified for individual identification. They stay on the bird for long periods of time and are normally used on birds of prey."},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Among Us 86 HUMANS AND BIRDS T he urban environment presents opportunities for birds. It offers advantages in finding food and shelter. People, young and old, give bread crumbs to these interested visitors. When birds come to cities, houses and parks offer them protection. They can find more options when it comes to building a nest. Seagulls and owls have changed their behavior by adapting to the city, and other species, such as some sparrows, are no longer able to survive without a human presence. However, not everything is an advantage. In the city, birds have to face dangers and obstacles that do not exist in their natural habitat: a utility wire or a car can be fatal. BIRDS 87 Where to Find Them In big cities, groups of birds can be found in different areas. Busy and noisy areas, such as squares, parks, and gardens, attract many species. Calm, deserted spaces, such as cemeteries or deserted buildings, are chosen by birds in search of peace. Other places where birds choose to eat and sleep include plots and landfills with lots of food, as well as nooks in high places, such as balconies, belfries, and roosts. PLOTS AND CEMETERIES Plants with seeds usually grow in these places, which are located far from urban centers. For this reason, magpies and nightingales favor them. URBAN CENTERS With the arrival of cold weather, different bird species from the countryside and the mountains come to the city. In general, they stay until the beginning of spring. In the winter, more birds, such as chiffchaffs, great tits, and robins, can be observed in cities. PARKS AND GARDENS Royal peacocks and green peafowls share these places, where they can find the microhabitats of insects on which they feed. Parks and gardens may have ponds that are visited by other bird species as well. Few species nest in these places because these spaces offer little quiet. GROVE DAY/NIGHT Artificial night lighting intensifies birds' activities. They organize their tasks according to street lighting. BLACKBIRDS were originally migratory, but as they adjusted to cities, they became nonmigratory. SEAGULLS usually fight among themselves for the food they get from landfills. WAGTAILS nest in holes or crannies, always near water. Population Control Without enough predators and with an abundance of food, urban bird populations grow exponentially. The Urban Environment This setting is characterized by environmental and climatic factors that are different from the natural ones. It has more varieties of plants, higher average temperatures, less wind, more rain, cloudier skies, and less solar radiation. Polluted air and soil are harmful factors for both humans and birds.

For example, seagulls can feed on garbage; great tits drink milk from containers by adroitly uncapping them; and some magpies have learned to tear cardboard containers to eat the eggs inside. PIGEONS spend a lot of time together. They are granivores but eat all kinds of food. SWIFTS are insectivores. They catch their prey in flight. FALCONS Diurnal birds of prey. They nest on the roofs of high buildings.

They need to have a place with appropriate temperature, humidity, and ventilation in order to yield the desired amount of meat or eggs. For this reason, it is necessary to maintain continuous environmental and sanitary control of the area in which they are bred. Ideally they should be able to walk, run, scratch the earth in search of food, and take sunbaths. Additionally, to protect them from predators and from inclement weather, it is important to shelter them in coops. This allows them to rest peacefully and sleep at night. AIRMAIL For more than 1,700 years, human beings have used pigeons to send messages. Armies have used them as communication aids during wars. Pigeon keeping is the practice of breeding and preparing pigeons to become messengers, a task that makes the most of their agility and intelligence. BIRD FLU TURKEY On the American continent, these birds were domesticated by the indigenous pre- Columbians from a wild Mexican species called Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo. GOOSE Contemporary domestic breeds descend from wild Asian and eastern European species. They are voracious, which makes fattening them easy. DUCK These birds are an important source of food in Southeast Asia. In Central and South America, the consumption of ducks is less widespread. The domestication of birds is a very old activity, as shown by records from different cultures in different parts of the world. It was related to the adoption of a sedentary way of life by human populations. DOMESTICATION IN HISTORY MIXED DIET Birds look for insects and plant shoots as they peck the soil. The breeder complements this diet with nutritionally balanced foods. QUENCHING THIRST Ten chickens drink from 0.5 to 0.8 gallon (2–3 l) of water a day. The farmer provides them with water in troughs, which are placed all over the henhouse. 5000 BC India There are records of domestic geese in India, beginning in 5000 BC. 2000 BC Far East Descendants of the royal duck (Anas platyrhynchos) were domesticated in this area of the Asian continent (what is now China). 1492 Mexico The Spanish colonizers encountered turkeys domesticated by inhabitants of the New World. 2 The virus can be transmitted to the most common of domestic birds: chickens. 1 Ducks carry the H5N1 virus but are immune to this disease. The H5N1 virus is transmitted to humans through direct contact with domestic birds. 3 At Your Service Domestic birds have been bred from the following orders: Galliformes (hens, quails, turkeys, and pheasants), Anseriformes (ducks and geese), Columbiformes (pigeons), Passeriformes (canaries), and Psittaciformes (parakeets and parrots). In poultry farming, they are divided according to their use: barnyard birds (Galliformes, Anseriformes, and Columbiformes) and companion birds or pets (Passeriformes and Psittaciformes). Commercial poultry farming of barnyard birds generates high revenues worldwide. Farmers can take advantage of the fact that birds are very active during the day, that they readily live in groups, and that they have a high reproductive rate due to polygamous behavior. Pets have commercial appeal, with their colorful plumage, ability to express themselves, and friendliness toward humans. These characteristics make them much- appreciated pets. CAGED Canaries, native to the Canary Islands, have been selectively bred by humans for nearly four centuries. T he breeding of birds in captivity has great social and economic value. This activity is carried out all over the world on industrial poultry farms and family farms where birds are raised for consumption and sale. A great variety of domestic birds have been developed from species inhabiting natural environments. We use their flesh and eggs as food and their feathers in coats to protect us against the cold. We also use birds for communication and as colorful and melodic pets. They are so dependent on people that in some cases they cannot survive when they are freed. This disease, also called avian influenza A, is caused by a virus whose strains have various levels of virulence. It disseminated from Asian markets, where the overcrowding of domestic birds is common. This promoted the spread of the disease to wild birds. As of 2006, more than 30 million birds had succumbed to this disease. Cats, pigs, and human beings have also been infected. 50% THE COMMOTION AND FEAR OVER DISEASE HAVE REDUCED THE DEMAND FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF DOMESTIC BIRDS IN MAJOR EUROPEAN CITIES BY HALF.

The cutting of trees in rainforests and woodlands has destroyed many bird habitats, the loss of which is the leading cause of bird extinctions today. Also, the introduction of animals such as cats, dogs, and rats to new areas has created a threat for many bird species. Indirect poisoning with pesticides, the trafficking of exotic birds as pets, and the sale of feathers have done further damage to many species. Fortunately, all is not lost. The first step to conserving the world's avifauna is to learn about the extinction of birds and its magnitude.

EXTINCT BIRDS POISONING SAVING THE PEREGRINE FALCON FROM EXTINCTION BIRDS OF THE WORLD CLASSIFICATION OF RISK There were 350 couples of peregrine falcons in the United States. SPECIES HAVE GONE EXTINCT SINCE THE 18TH CENTURY. 129 179 At critical risk 4 Extinct in the wild 1,212 Endangered species 788 Species about to be endangered 7, 7 7 5 Non-endangered species (or no information available) 679 Vulnerable 350 Endangered Dodo from Mauritius Quickly exterminated by colonizers and seafarers in the 17th century The Most Important Causes Birds are very sensitive to changes in their habitats, and this is the main cause of extinction (87 percent of species are affected by it). Excessive hunting is another of the greatest dangers, affecting 29 percent of the endangered species in the world. The introduction of foreign species is yet another major danger, jeopardizing 28 percent of species. In addition, the intervention of human beings through the destruction of habitats and the introduction of pollution combined with the occurrence of natural disasters harms more than 10 percent of species. Alarming Data Five percent of the planet's surface houses three fourths of endangered species. This area coincides with tropical regions where biodiversity is greater. For this reason, tropical countries top the list to the right. On some islands, the proportion of endangered birds is very high: in the Philippines and in New Zealand, it includes 35 to 42 percent of avian fauna. Pesticides 1960 Peregrine falcons disappeared in the wild because of excessive use of pesticides (DDT and dieldrin). 1970 Falcons were bred in captivity at Cornell University, to be set free later. 1986 850 birds were set free in the southern United States.

The syrinx originates in the bronchi. Calamus The lower part of the vane that is wider, hollow, and, in general, naked. The feather is attached to the skin through the calamus. Camouflage A characteristic that enables the animal to blend into its environment. It allows the animal to go unnoticed in the presence of predators. Carnivore An animal that feeds on meat Coverts Layers of contour feathers that provide a bird's body and wings with support and an aerodynamic surface Crepuscular Active at dawn or twilight, when there is little light Crest Extended or raised feathers located on the upper part of a bird's head Crop Membranous sac that communicates with a bird's esophagus, where food is softened Dermal Papilla Structure from which a feather develops. It is composed of epidermal and dermal cells. Display Behavior directed at attracting the attention of a partner. It can also be done to threaten or distract another animal. Distribution Place where a species is located. It includes the area the species occupies in different seasons. Down Feather A very thin and light feather, similar to silk, that birds have underneath their external plumage. Down feathers constitute the first plumage of chicks. Ecosystem Community of living beings whose vital processes are interrelated and develop according to the physical factors of the same environment Egg Large rounded shell, laid by a female bird, that contains a yolk and a white. If fertilized, the egg has a tiny embryo that will develop into a chick (the chick feeds itself on the yolk and white). When ready, the chick will break the eggshell. Egg Tooth Sharp calcium growth, in the shape of a tooth, that forms on the tip of a chick's bill during the embryonic phase. The chick uses the egg tooth to break its shell at birth. Environment The natural conditions, such as vegetation and land, that surround animals and influence their development and behavior Epiphysis Endocrine gland located below the corpus callosum in the brain. It produces a hormone that regulates sexual activity. Evolution Gradual process of change that a species undergoes to adjust to the environment Extinct No longer existing. Many bird species are now extinct (for example, ictiornites). Feather Each unit of the covering (plumage) of a bird. The feathers are composed of a hard substance called keratin. They have a long quill, to which two blades are joined. The blades—formed by a great number of barbs, uniformly distributed—give the feather its shape and color. Fertilization Union of the reproductive cells of a male and a female that will create a new individual Field Mark Natural distinct feature or artificial identification of an individual of a bird species that helps ornithologists distinguish it from other individuals of the same or other avian species Fledgling Very young bird that lives in the nest where it was raised Fossils Vestiges of ancient creatures of different types (vegetal or animal) on a stone substratum. Fossils can be found in the geologic strata of the Earth's surface. Gastric Juice Set of fluids produced by the stomach glands of birds and other animals Gizzard Muscular stomach of a bird. It is very robust, especially in granivores, and it is used to grind and soften the food by means of mechanical pressure. The food arrives at the gizzard mixed with digestive juices. Gland Type of structure that is present in most multicellular living beings. It produces substances that act either inside or outside a bird's body. Gonad Organ that makes male or female gametes. In birds, the testicles and ovaries are gonads. Granivore Bird that feeds on seeds or grains. Many birds are granivores (for example, parrots and toucans). Gular Sac Skin fragment in the shape of a sac that hangs from the lower mandible of certain birds (for example, pelicans) Carrion The remains of dead animals used as food by some birds or other animals. Vultures are scavengers (i.e., animals that feed on carrion). Center of Gravity Point at which the sum of all the gravitational forces that act on a body converge Cere Thin skin layer that covers the base of the bill Chick A baby bird that has just come out of the eggshell and that has not yet left the nest. Its diet and safety depend on its parents. Chorion One of the coverings that wraps the embryo of reptiles, birds, and mammals Class One of the many divisions scientists use to classify animals. Birds form a class of their own. Climate Average temperature, humidity, and pressure that determine the atmospheric conditions of a region and that are related to other geographic characteristics of that region Cloaca The widened and dilatable final portion of the intestine of a bird or other animal in which the urinogenital tubes converge Courtship Behavior patterns that males and females follow to try to attract partners"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"94 GLOSSARY BIRDS 95 Habitat Native or natural environment of an animal or plant Hatching Cracking of the eggshell so that the bird cancome out Histologic Related to tissues and their study. When the anatomy of a bird is studied, the tissues that form the bird's organs are analyzed. Hormones Secretion of certain glands that circulates through the body. They excite, inhibit, or regulate the activities of organs or of systems of organs. Horn Made of horn or of a consistency similar to that of horn. The bill of birds is hornlike. Hypophysis Internal secretion organ located at the hollow of the skull's base (called silla turca). It is composed of two lobes: one anterior and glandular and the other posterior and nervous. The hormones produced by the hypophysis influence growth and sexual development, among other things. Hypothalamus Region of the encephalon located at the cerebral base, joined to the hypophysis by a nerve stem, in which important centers for vegetative life are found Incubation The act of keeping the eggs warm so that the embryos inside can grow and hatch. Usually the chick's parents use their own bodies to warm the eggs, but some birds use sand or decomposing plants to cover them. Insectivore Bird that eats insects as part of its diet Instinct Innate behavior that a bird or other animal develops and that is not learned. The offspring of ducks start to swim by instinct. Invertebrate Animal that lacks a spinal column. Worms, crabs, and jellyfish are examples. Lethargy Sleep through which a bird can reduce its cardiac rhythm and its body temperature to save energy, especially at night and during extended periods of cold Malpighian Layer Layer of epithelial cells that forms the bird's epidermis Mangrove Swamp Type of ecosystem often considered a type of biome. It is composed of trees that are very tolerant to salt. These trees are found in the intertidal zone of tropical coasts. Areas with mangrove swamps include estuaries and coastal zones. Migration The movement of birds from one region to another; it usually takes place in the spring and fall. It is also common among other species of animals. Molt Process through which birds lose old worn feathers, replacing them with new ones Monogamous Birds that mate with only one individual of the opposite sex. Many penguins have monogamous behavior. Piscivore Birds living in continental or oceanic waters that feed on fish Pollution A consequence of human actions for natural environments. The emission of industrial gases into the atmosphere, for example, produces pollution. Polygamy Reproductive relationship between one animal of one sex and several animals of the other. When one male mates with several females, it is called polygyny. Only rarely do females have multiple male reproductive partners (polyandry). Population Set of individuals of the same species that live together in the same space at the same time Predator Animal that hunts other animals. Birds of prey hunt other birds, mammals, and vertebrates. Prey Animal hunted by another to serve as food for the latter. Animals that hunt prey are called predators. Protein Organic macromolecule that is part of living beings. By including proteins in their diet, birds get the necessary amino acids to build their own organs. Protein Cord Embryonic structure: each of the two filaments that sustain the yolk of the egg within the white Proventriculus The first portion of the stomach, or the true stomach, of a bird. The other portion of a bird's stomach is the gizzard. Rectrices Technical term used by ornithologists to describe a bird's tail feathers Scale Dermic or epidermic layer that totally or partially covers the feet of birds. They are reptilian vestiges. Song Sound or series of sounds produced by a bird to demarcate its territory or to find a mate. The songs of birds can be simple or elaborate, and some are very melodic. Songbirds Singing birds. Passerines include songbirds. Species Set of individuals that recognize themselves as belonging to the same reproductive unit Sternum Central chest bone. The sternum of flying birds has a large surface in which muscles are inserted. Survival A bird's ability to face the demands of its environment and of intra- and interspecies relationships Swamp Depression on the ground in which water is gathered, sometimes called a marsh. Its bottom is more or less boggy. It is the habitat of many wading birds. Thermal Hot air current that rises. Many birds make use of it to gain height effortlessly. Theropods Group to which carnivorous dinosaurs belong Training Teaching an animal new skills. Carrier pigeons are trained. Tundra Vast plains without trees in the Arctic regions of northern Asia, Europe, and North America Uropygial Gland Produces an oily secretion that birds, using their bills, spread on their feathers to make them impermeable Vertebrate Animals that have a spinal column, such as birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals Virus Infectious agent that depends on a living being to reproduce. Avian flu is transmitted this way. Vulnerable Birds that are endangered in their natural habitats Yolk Yellow part of the egg. If the egg is fertilized, a small embryo grows that will use the yolk (and white) as food. Young Bird or any other animal at an early stage of life. Some young show color patterns that are very different from that of adults of the same species, which makes it difficult for predators to identify them. Morphology Study of the form of an object or structure. For instance, the morphology of the feet of birds is an area of study. Nectar Sweet and sugary secretions found in flowers that attract birds and other animals. Hummingbirds feed on nectar. Nidicolous A helpless chick that depends on its parents' care after birth Nidifugous A chick that can move and leave the nest as soon as it breaks its shell. In less than a day, such chicks can move agilely. Nocturnal Active at night. Many birds of prey, such as owls, specialize in nocturnal hunting. Nutrient Any substance obtained through diet that participates in the vital functions of a living being. Omnivore Bird that has a varied diet, including animal and vegetal foods Pelagic Birds that live in areas over open waters, away from the coast Pellet (Bolus) Small, hard mass that some birds regurgitate (vomit). It contains parts of the food that they could not digest, such as bones, fur, feathers, and teeth.

Whether forming caves in the middle of mountains, mixed among folds, or lying at the bottom of lakes and oceans, stones are everywhere, and they hold clues to the past. By studying rocks, we can reconstruct the history of the Earth. Even the most insignificant rocks can tell stories about other times, because rocks have been around since the beginning of the universe. They were part of the cloud of dust and gases that revolved around the Sun over four billion years ago. Rocks have been silent witnesses to the cataclysms our planet has experienced. They know the cold of the glacial era, the intense heat of the Earth's interior, and the fury of the oceans. They store much information about how external agents, such as wind, rain, ice, and temperature changes, have been altering the planet's surface for millions of years. F or ancient civilizations, stones symbolized eternity. This idea has persisted throughout time because stones endure, but they are recycled time and again. Fifty million years from now, nothing will be as we now know it—not the Andes, nor the Himalayas, nor the ice of Antarctica, nor the Sahara Desert. Weathering and erosion, though slow, will never stop. This should free us from any illusion of the immortality of the Earth's features. What will everything be like in the future? We don't know. The only sure thing is that there will be rocks. Only stones will remain, and their chemical composition, shape, and texture will provide clues about previous geological events and about what the Earth's surface was like in the past. In the pages of this book, illustrated with stunning images, you will find invaluable information about the language of rocks and natural forces in general. You will also learn to identify the most important minerals, know their physical and chemical properties, and discover the environments in which they form. D id you know that the Earth's crust and its oceans are sources of useful and essential minerals for human beings? Coal, petroleum, and natural gas found in the crust allow us to travel and to heat our homes. Furthermore, practically all the products that surround us have elements provided by rocks and minerals. For example, aluminum is used to produce beverage cans; copper is used in electric cables; and titanium, mixed with other durable metals, is used in the construction of spacecraft. We invite you to enjoy this book. It is full of interesting and worthwhile information. Don't miss out on it!

The Earth cools and the first ocean is formed. The oldest minerals, such as zircon, form. The oldest rocks metamorphose, forming gneiss. 1,100 Rodinia, an early supercontinent, forms. A meteorite falls in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. 542 The supercontinent Panotia forms, containing portions of present-day continents. North America separates from Panotia. Laurentia and Baltica converge, creating the Caledonian range. Gneiss forms on the coast of Scotland. The region that will become North America moves toward the Equator, thus initiating the development of the most important carboniferous formations. Gondwana moves slowly; the ocean floor spreads at a similar speed. The fragments of continents combine to form a single continent called Pangea. The Appalachian Mountains form. The formation of slate through sedimentation is at its peak. Baltica and Siberia clash, forming the Ural Mountains. Eruptions of basalt occur in Siberia. The first major orogeny (Caledonian folding) begins. Gondwana moves toward the South Pole. Temperatures fall. The level of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere is 16 times higher than it is today. The largest carbon deposits we observe today form where forests previously existed. Amphibians diversify and reptiles originate from one amphibian group to become the first amniotes. Winged insects such as dragonflies emerge. Palm trees and conifers replace the vegetation from the Carboniferous Period. 800 Second glaciation 600 Last massive glaciation 2,500 Glaciations: White Earth The Earth undergoes the first of its massive global cooling events (glaciations).

Each orogeny is characterized by its own particular materials and location. The rocks of this period contain an abundance of fish fossils. Areas of solid ground are populated by gigantic ferns. TRILOBITES Marine arthropods with mineralized exoskeletons SILURIAN One of the first pisciform vertebrates, an armored fish without mandibles It is thought that the Earth's atmosphere contained far less carbon dioxide during the Ordovician than today.

By this period, vertebrates with mandibles, such as the placoderms, osteichthyans (bony fish), and acanthodians, have already emerged. THE CORE The Earth's core is extremely hot and is made mostly of iron and nickel. G eologists and paleontologists use many sources to reconstruct the Earth's history. The analysis of rocks, minerals, and fossils found on the Earth's surface provides data about the deepest layers of the planet's crust and reveals both climatic and atmospheric changes that are often associated with catastrophes. Craters caused by the impact of meteorites and other bodies on the surface of the Earth also reveal valuable information about the history of the planet. Traversing Time ELEMENTS PRESENT ACCORDING TO THE TABLE Existing in different combinations, the crust of the Earth contains the same elements today as those that were present when the planet was formed. The most abundant element in the crust is oxygen, which bonds with metals and nonmetals to form different compounds. THE CAMBRIAN EXPLOSION Fossils from this time attest to the great diversity of marine animals and the emergence of different types of skeletal structures, such as those found in sponges and trilobites. THE FIRST ANIMALS Among the most mysterious fossils of the Precambrian Period are the remains of the Ediacaran fauna, the Earth's first-known animals. They lived at the bottom of the ocean. Many were round and reminiscent of jellyfish, while others were flat and sheetlike. MASS EXTINCTION Near the end of the Permian Period, an estimated 95 percent of marine organisms and over two thirds of terrestrial ones perish in the greatest known mass extinction. Complex Structure THE FORMATION OF THE INTERIOR Cosmic materials began to accumulate, forming a growing celestial body, the precursor of the Earth. High temperatures combined with gravity caused the heaviest elements to migrate to the center of the planet and the lighter ones to move toward the surface. Under a rain of meteors, the external layers began to consolidate and form the Earth's crust. In the center, metals such as iron concentrated into a red-hot nucleus. 8 DYNAMICS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST Metals Transition metals Nonmetals Noble gases Lanthanide series Actinide series METALLIC CORE The light elements form the mantle.

Proliferation of insects Appearance of dinosaurs The first mammals evolve from a group of reptiles called Therapsida. Birds emerge. The dinosaurs undergo adaptive radiation. North America and Europe drift apart. North and South America are joined at the end of this time period. The formation of Patagonia concludes, and an important overthrust raises the Andes mountain range. The heat caused by the expansion of fragments from the impact together with the greenhouse effect brought about by the spreading of ashes in the stratosphere provoked a series of climatic changes. It is believed that this process resulted in the extinction of the dinosaurs. The African Rift Zone and the Red Sea open up. The Indian protocontinent collides with Eurasia. Gondwana reappears. IMPACT FROM THE OUTSIDE  It is believed that a large meteor fell on Chicxulub, on the Yucatán Peninsula (Mexico), about 65 million years ago. The impact caused an explosion that created a cloud of ash mixed with carbon rocks. When the debris fell back to Earth, some experts believe it caused a great global fire. THE LAST GLACIATION The most recent period of glaciation begins three million years ago and intensifies at the beginning of the Quaternary period. North Pole glaciers advance, and much of the Northern Hemisphere becomes covered in ice. HUMAN BEINGS APPEAR ON EARTH. Although the oldest hominid fossils (Sahelanthropus) date back to seven million years ago, it is believed that modern humans emerged in Africa at the end of the Pleistocene. Humans migrated to Europe 100,000 years ago, although settling there was difficult because of the glacial climate. According to one hypothesis, our ancestors reached the American continent about 10,000 years ago by traveling across the area now known as the Bering Strait.

The cause of their extinction is still under debate. Carbon dioxide levels increase. Average temperatures are higher than today. The level of oxygen (O 2 ) in the atmosphere is much lower than today. The global average temperature is at least 62° F (17° C). The ice layer covering Antarctica later thickens. Temperatures drop to levels similar to those of today. The lower temperatures cause forests to shrink and grasslands to expand. Vast development of feathered bird species and mammals covered with long fur THE AGE OF FLOWERING PLANTS At the end of the Cretaceous Period, the first angiosperms—plants with protected seeds, flowers, and fruits—appear. 10 DYNAMICS OF THE EARTH’S CRUST ANOTHER MASS EXTINCTION Toward the end of the Cretaceous Period, about 50 percent of existing species disappear. The dinosaurs, the large marine reptiles (such as the Plesiosaurs), the flying creatures of that period (such as the Pterosaurs), and the ammonites (cephalopod mollusks) disappear from the Earth. At the beginning of the Cenozoic Era, most of the habitats of these extinct species begin to be occupied by mammals. Outer Core The outer core is 1,400 miles (2,270 km) thick and contains melted iron, nickel, and other minor chemical compounds. Inner Core The inner core has a diameter of 756 miles (1,216 km). It is made of iron and nickel, which are solidified due to their exposure to high pressure and temperature conditions. Minerals, such as iron and silicates, are widely spread among the major constituents of the crust. Only the movements of the crust on the molten mantle disrupt their equilibrium.

It is now buried under almost 2 miles (3 km) of limestone. 62 miles (100 km) CRUST The Earth's crust can reach a thickness of up to 6 miles (10 km) at the bottom of the ocean and up to 30 miles (50 km) on the continents. MANTLE The mantle is 1,800 miles (2,900 km) thick and is composed mainly of solid rock. Its temperature increases with depth. A notable component of the upper mantle is the asthenosphere, which is semisolid. In the asthenosphere, superficial rock layers that will eventually form the Earth's crust are melted.

It is an ever-changing system whose activity we experience all the time: volcanoes erupt, earthquakes occur, and new rocks emerge on the Earth's surface. All these phenomena, which originate in the interior of the planet, are studied in a branch of geology called internal geodynamics. This science analyzes processes, such as continental drift and isostatic movement, which originate with the movement of the crust and result in the raising and sinking of large areas. The movement of the Earth's crust also generates the conditions that form new rocks. This movement affects magmatism (the melting of materials that solidify to become igneous rocks) and metamorphism (the series of transformations occurring in solid materials that give rise to metamorphic rocks). Magmatism Magma is produced when the temperature in the mantle or crust reaches a level at which minerals with the lowest fusion point begin to melt. Because magma is less dense than the solid material surrounding it, it rises, and in so doing it cools and begins to crystallize. When this process occurs in the interior of the crust, plutonic or intrusive rocks, such as granite, are produced. If this process takes place on the outside, volcanic or effusive rocks, such as basalt, are formed. INNER CRUST Plutonic Rocks OUTER CRUST Volcanic rocks Metamorphism An increase in pressure and/or temperature causes rocks to become plastic and their minerals to become unstable. These rocks then chemically react with the substances surrounding them, creating different chemical combinations and thus causing new rocks to form. These rocks are called metamorphic rocks. Examples of this type of rock are marble, quartzite, and gneiss. Folding Although solid, the materials forming the Earth's crust are elastic. The powerful forces of the Earth place stress upon the materials and create folds in the rock. When this happens, the ground rises and sinks. When this activity occurs on a large scale, it can create mountain ranges or chains. This activity typically occurs in the subduction zones. Fracture When the forces acting upon rocks become too intense, the rocks lose their plasticity and break, creating two types of fractures: joints and faults. When this process happens too abruptly, earthquakes occur. Joints are fissures and cracks, whereas faults are fractures in which blocks are displaced parallel to a fracture plane. FOLDS For folds to form, rocks must be relatively plastic and be acted upon by a force. RUPTURE When rocks rupture quickly, an earthquake occurs. Oceanic Plate Magmatic Chamber Asthenosphere Crust Convective Currents PRESSURE This force gives rise to new metamorphic rocks, as older rocks fuse with the minerals that surround them.

Through the combination of these processes, rocks merge, disintegrate, and join again. Living organisms, especially plant roots and digging animals, cooperate with these geologic processes. Once the structure of the minerals that make up a rock is disrupted, the minerals disintegrate and fall to the mercy of the rain and wind, which erode them. Weathering Mechanical agents can disintegrate rocks, and chemical agents can decompose them. Disintegration and decomposition can result from the actions of plant roots, heat, cold, wind, and acid rain. The breaking down of rock is a slow but inexorable process. WATER In a liquid or frozen state, water penetrates into the rock fissures, causing them to expand and shatter. A variety of forces can cause rock fragments to break into smaller pieces, either by acting on the rocks directly or by transporting rock fragments that chip away at the rock surface. MECHANICAL PROCESSES Erosion External agents, such as water, wind, air, and living beings, either acting separately or together, wear down, and their loose fragments may be transported. This process is known as erosion. In dry regions, the wind transports grains of sand that strike and polish exposed rocks. On the coast, wave action slowly eats away at the rocks. In this process, materials eroded by the wind or water are carried away and deposited at lower elevations, and these new deposits can later turn into other rocks. EOLIAN PROCESSES The wind drags small particles against the rocks. This wears them down and produces new deposits of either loess or sand depending on the size of the particle.

TEMPERATURE When the temperature of the air changes significantly over a few hours, it causes rocks to expand and contract abruptly. The daily repetition of this phenomenon can cause rocks to rupture. Transportation and Sedimentation Cave Water current Limestone River HYDROLOGIC PROCESSES All types of moving water slowly wear down rock surfaces and carry loose particles away. The size of the particles that are carried away from the rock surface depends on the volume and speed of the flowing water. High-volume and high- velocity water can move larger particles.

These rocks are composed of tiny fragments of one or more materials. These materials are minerals, which result from the interaction of different chemical elements, each of which is stable only under specific conditions of pressure and temperature. Both rocks and minerals are studied in the branches of geology called petrology and mineralogy. rock batholiths formed during a period of great volcanic activity and created the Torres del Paine and its high mountains. 12 million years ago From Minerals to Rocks From a chemical perspective, a mineral is a homogeneous substance. A rock, on the other hand, is composed of different chemical substances, which, in turn, are components of minerals. The mineral components of rocks are also those of mountains. Thus, according to this perspective, it is possible to distinguish between rocks and minerals.

MINERALS COME FROM Components The basic components of minerals are the chemical elements listed on the periodic table. Minerals are classified as native if they are found in isolation, contain only one element, and occur in their purest state. On the other hand, they are classified as compound if they are composed of two or more elements. Most minerals fall into the compound category. NATIVE MINERALS These minerals are classified into: GOLD An excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Acids have little or no effect on it. A- METALS AND INTERMETALS Native minerals have high thermal and electrical conductivity, a typically metallic luster, low hardness, ductility, and malleability. They are easy to identify and include gold, copper, and lead. B- SEMIMETALS Native minerals that are more fragile than metals and have a lower conductivity. Examples are arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. C- NONMETALS An important group of minerals, which includes sulfur Isotypic Minerals Isomorphism happens when minerals with the same structure, such as halite and galena, exchange cations. The structure remains the same, but the resulting substance is different, because one ion has been exchanged for another. An example of this process is siderite (rhombic FeCO 3 ), which gradually changes to magnesite (MgCO 3 ) when it trades its iron (Fe) for similarly- sized magnesium (Mg). Because the ions are the same size, the structure remains unchanged. Polymorphism A phenomenon in which the same chemical composition can create multiple structures and, consequently, result in the creation of several different minerals. The transition of one polymorphous variant into another, facilitated by temperature or pressure conditions, can be fast or slow and either reversible or irreversible. types of minerals have been recognized by the International Association of Mineralogy.

Both graphite and diamond are composed only of carbon; however, they have different degrees of hardness. Atoms form hexagons that are strongly interconnected in parallel sheets. This structure allows the sheets to slide over one another. Each atom is joined to four other atoms of the same type. The carbon network extends in three dimensions by means of strong covalent bonds. This provides the mineral with an almost unbreakable hardness.

The properties of a compound mineral differ from those of its constituent elements. M inerals are the “bricks” of materials that make up the Earth and all other solid bodies in the universe. They are usually defined both by their chemical composition and by their orderly internal structure. Most are solid crystalline substances. However, some minerals have a disordered internal structure and are simply amorphous solids similar to glass. Studying minerals helps us to understand the origin of the Earth. Minerals are classified according to their composition and internal structure, as well as by the properties of hardness, weight, color, luster, and transparency. Although more than 4,000 minerals have been discovered, only about 30 are common on the Earth's surface.

This characteristic can be analyzed under a petrographic microscope, which differs from ordinary microscopes in that it has two devices that polarize light. This feature makes it possible to determine some of the optical responses of the mineral. However, the most precise way to identify a mineral by its optical properties is to use an X-ray diffractometer. EXOTIC COLOR QUARTZ ROCK CRYSTAL Colorless; the purest state of quartz SMOKY Dark, brown, or gray minerals CITRINE The presence of iron produces a very pale yellow color. AMETHYST The presence of iron in a ferric state results in a purple color. ROSE The presence of manganese results in a pink color. Refraction and Luster Refraction is related to the speed with which light moves through a crystal. Depending on how light propagates through them, minerals can be classified as monorefringent or birefringent. Luster results from reflection and refraction of light on the surface of a mineral. In general, it depends on the index of refraction of a mineral's surface, the absorption of incident light, and other factors, such as concrete characteristics of the observed surface (for instance, degree of smoothness and polish). Based on their luster, minerals can be divided into three categories. METALLIC Minerals in this class are completely opaque, a characteristic typical of native elements, such as copper, and sulfides, such as galena. SUBMETALLIC Minerals in this class have a luster that is neither metallic nor nonmetallic. NONMETALLIC Minerals in this class transmit light when cut into very thin sheets. They can have several types of luster: vitreous (quartz), pearlescent, silky (talc), resinous, or earthy. Color is one of the most striking properties of minerals. However, in determining the identity of a mineral, color is not always useful. Some minerals never change color; they are called idiochromatic. Others whose colors are variable are called allochromatic. A mineral's color changes can be related, among other things, to the presence of impurities or inclusions (solid bodies) inside of it. Streak is the color of a mineral's fine powder, which can be used to identify it. Some minerals always have the same color; one example is malachite. INHERENT COLOR A mineral can have several shades, depending on its impurities or inclusions. Luminescence Certain minerals emit light when they are exposed to particular sources of energy. A mineral is fluorescent if it lights up when exposed to ultraviolet rays or X-rays. It is phosphorescent if it keeps glowing after the energy source is removed. Some minerals will also respond to cathode rays, ordinary light, heat, or other electric currents. MALACHITE SULFUR Other secondary minerals, known as exotic minerals, are responsible for giving quartz its color; when it lacks exotic minerals, quartz is colorless. AGATE A type of chalcedony, a cryptocrystalline variety of quartz, of nonuniform coloring More reliable than a mineral's color is its streak (the color of the fine powder left when the mineral is rubbed across a hard white surface). COLOR STREAK Agates crystallize in banded patterns because of the environments in which they form. They fill the cavities of rocks by precipitating out of aqueous solutions at low temperatures. Their colors reflect the porosity of the stone, its degree of inclusions, and the crystallization process.

One physical property is hardness. One mineral is harder than another when the former can scratch the latter. A mineral's degree of hardness is based on a scale, ranging from 1 to 10, that was created by German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs. Another physical property of a mineral is its tenacity, or cohesion—that is, its degree of resistance to rupture, deformation, or crushing. Yet another is magnetism, the ability of a mineral to be attracted by a magnet. Exfoliation and Fracture When a mineral tends to break along the planes of weak bonds in its crystalline structure, it separates into flat sheets parallel to its surface. This is called exfoliation. Minerals that do not exfoliate when they break are said to exhibit fracture, which typically occurs in irregular patterns. 1. TALC is the softest mineral. 2. GYPSUM can be scratched by a fingernail. 3. CALCITE is as hard as a bronze coin. 4. FLUORITE can be scratched by a knife. 5. APATITE can be scratched by a piece of glass. 6. ORTHOCLASE can be scratched by a drill bit. 7. QUARTZ can be scratched by tempered steel. 8. TOPAZ can be scratched with a steel file. 9. CORUNDUM can be scratched only by diamond. 10.

It is known as “the devil's kitchen” because it has the highest average temperature in the world, 93° F (34° C). Dallol is basically a desert of minerals with an ivory-colored crust, sprinkled with green ponds and towers of sulfurous salt, in shades of orange, called hornitos (8 to 10 feet [2.5–3 m] high), many of which are active and spit out boiling water.

The heat causes the water to rise at high pressure through layers of salt and sulfur. The water then dissolves the salt and sulfur, which precipitate out as the water cools at the surface. As a result, ponds and hornitos are created. The richness of their coloring may be explained by their sulfurous composition and by the presence of certain bacteria. There are two types of hornitos: active ones, which forcefully expel boiling water, and inactive ones, which simply contain salt. TYPES OF HORNITOS ACTIVE It expels boiling water, and it is constantly growing. INACTIVE Composed of salt, the hornito no longer expels water. It was active in the past.

Most crystals originate when molten rock from inside the Earth cools and hardens. Crystallography is the branch of science that studies the growth, shape, and geometric characteristics of crystals. The arrangement of atoms in a crystal can be determined using X-ray diffraction. The relationship between chemical composition of the crystal, arrangement of atoms, and bond strengths among atoms is studied in crystallographic chemistry. CRYSTALS OF COMMON SALT When salt forms larger crystals, their shape can be seen under a microscope. CUBIC STRUCTURE is created through the spatial equilibrium between different ions, which attract each other, and similar ions, which repel each other. A crystal's structure is repeated on the inside, even in the arrangement of its smallest parts: chlorine and sodium ions. In this case, the electrical forces (attraction among opposite ions and repulsion among similar ones) form cubes, which creates stability. However, different mineral compositions can take many other possible forms. INTERNAL CRYSTALLINE NETWORK LEGEND Chlorine Anion This nonmetal can only acquire a maximum negative charge of 1.

TETRAHEDRON Silica 1 silicon atom + 4 oxygen atoms DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CRYSTAL AND GLASS Glass is an amorphous solid. Because it solidifies quickly, the particles lose mobility before organizing themselves. ATOMIC MODEL OF A CRYSTAL The particles combine slowly in regular, stable shapes. 7 Crystalline Systems ATOMIC MODEL OF GLASS Solidification prevents the particles from organizing themselves. This makes the structure irregular. This type of bond occurs between two nonmetallic elements, such as nitrogen and oxygen. The atoms are geometrically organized to share electrons from their outer shells. This way, the whole structure becomes more stable. COVALENT BOND Typical of metallic elements that tend to lose electrons in the presence of other atoms with a negative charge. When a chlorine atom captures an electron from a sodium atom (metallic), both become electrically charged and mutually attract each other. The sodium atom shares an electron (negative charge) and becomes positively charged, whereas the chlorine completes its outer shell, becoming negative. IONIC BOND Example: Halite (salt) Sodium Atom Chlorine Atom The sodium atom loses an electron and becomes positively charged. The anion and the cation (positive ion) are electrically attracted to one another. They bond, forming a new, stable compound. Sodium Atom Chlorine Atom The chlorine atom gains an electron (negative charge) and becomes a negatively charged ion (anion). Example: Ammonia BEFORE BONDING AFTER BONDING Na Na+ Cl Cl- Hydrogen Atom Nitrogen Atom The nitrogen atom needs three electrons to stabilize its outer shell; the hydrogen atom needs only one. The union of all four atoms creates a stable state.así la logran. The combination of two ions results in a cubic form.

They appear in nature in two ways: without an identifiable form or with a definite arrangement of atoms. The external expressions of these arrangements are called crystals, of which there are 32 classes. Crystals are characterized by their organized atomic structure, called a crystalline network, built from a fundamental unit (unit cell). These networks can be categorized into the seven crystalline systems according to the crystal's arrangement. They can also be organized into 14 three-dimensional networks, known as the Bravais lattices. Typical Characteristics A crystal is a homogeneous solid whose chemical elements exhibit an organized internal structure. A unit cell refers to the distribution of atoms or molecules whose repetition in three dimensions makes up the crystalline structure. The existence of elements with shared symmetry allows the 32 crystal classes to be categorized into seven groups. These groups are based on pure geometric shapes, such as cubes, prisms, and pyramids. Bravais Lattices In 1850, Auguste Bravais demonstrated theoretically that atoms can be organized into only 14 types of three-dimensional networks. These network types are therefore named after him.

Monoclinic Prisms look like tetragonal crystals cut at an angle. Their axes do not meet at 90º angles. Tetragonal These crystals are shaped like cubes, but one of their facets is longer than the others. All three axes meet at 90º angles, but one axis is longer than the other two. Triclinic These crystals have very odd shapes. They are not symmetrical from one end to the other. None of their three axes meet at 90º angles.

Most diamond deposits are located in South Africa, Namibia, and Australia. Diamond Mineral composed of crystallized carbon in a cubic system. The beauty of its glow is due to a very high refraction index and the great dispersion of light in its interior, which creates an array of colors. It is the hardest of all minerals, and it originates underground at great depths.

THE LEGEND OF THE VALLEY OF DIAMONDS Alexander the Great introduced the legend of the Valley of Diamonds to Europe. According to this ancient account, later incorporated into the book The Thousand and One Nights , there was an inaccessible valley located in the mountains of northern India. The bed of this valley was covered with diamonds. To obtain them, raw meat was thrown in the valley and then fetched by trained birds, which would return it encrusted with diamonds. Elizabeth Taylor FINAL CUT D iamonds are a sign of status, and their monetary value is determined by the law of supply and demand. First discovered by Hindus in 500 BC, diamonds gained fame in the early 20th century when they were advertised in the United States as the traditional gift from husbands to their wives. Some diamonds became famous, however, not only for their economic value but also for the tales and myths surrounding them. The Misfortune of Possessing Hope The Hope Diamond is legendary for the harm it brought to its owners since being stolen from the temple of the goddess Sita in India. According to the legend, its curse took lives and devoured fortunes. In 1949 diamond expert Harry Winston bought it and in 1958 donated it to the Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, D.C., where it can be viewed by the public.

Evalyn Walsh McLean, the last private owner of the diamond, did not sell it even after several tragedies befell her family. Cullinan, the Greatest Find Discovered in 1905 in South Africa, this diamond is the biggest ever found. It was sold to the government of Transvaal two years after its discovery for $300,000 (£150,000). It was then given to Edward VII on the occasion of his 66th birthday.

Known as a ferromagnesian mineral, biotite's specific gravity varies between 3.2 and 3.6. DARK SILICATES LIGHT SILICATES Three- dimensional Structure Three fourths of the Earth's crust is composed of silicates with complex structures. Silicas, feldspars, feldspathoids, scapolites, and zeolites all have this type of structure. Their main characteristic is that their tetrahedrons share all their oxygen ions, forming a three- dimensional network with the same unitary composition. Quartz is part of the silica group. Simple Structure All silicates have the same basic component: a silicon-oxygen tetrahedron. This structure consists of four oxygen ions that surround a much smaller silicon ion. Because this tetrahedron does not share oxygen ions with other tetrahedrons, it keeps its simple structure. Complex Structure This structure occurs when the tetrahedrons share three of their four oxygen ions with neighboring tetrahedrons, spreading out to form a wide sheet. Because the strongest bonds are formed between silicon and oxygen, exfoliation runs in the direction of the other bonds, parallel to the sheets. There are several examples of this type of structure, but the most common ones are micas and clays. The latter can retain water within its sheets, which makes its size vary with hydration. S ilicates, which form 95 percent of the Earth's crust, are the most abundant type of mineral. Units of their tetrahedral structure, formed by the bonding of one silicon and four oxygen ions, combine to create several types of configurations, from isolated simple tetrahedrons to simple and double chains to sheets and three-dimensional complex networks. They can be light or dark; the latter have iron and magnesium in their chemical structures. Structures The basic unit of silicates consists of four oxygen ions located at the vertices of a tetrahedron, surrounding a silicon ion. Tetrahedrons can form by sharing oxygen ions, forming simple chains, laminar structures, or complex three- dimensional structures. The structural configuration also determines the type of exfoliation or fracture the silicate will exhibit: mica, which is composed of layers, exfoliates into flat sheets, whereas quartz fractures. OLIVINE OXYGEN SILICON Quartz has a complex three-dimensional structure composed only of silicon and oxygen. THREE- DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE Clays are complex minerals with a very fine grain and a sheetlike structure. CHAINS UNCOMBINED SILICATES This group includes all silicates composed of independent tetrahedrons of silicon and oxygen. Example: olivine.

One halite is table salt (or sodium chloride). Halites have many uses: fluorite is used in the industrial production of steel, and sylvite (potassium chloride) is used as fertilizer. Halides Car b onates Hydroxides Sulfates Phosphates Metal associations with oxygen atoms. Ilmenite, hematite, and chromite are ores from which titanium, iron, and chrome are extracted. Rubies and sapphires are extracted from corundum. Oxides In addition to carbon—which forms minerals such as diamond and graphite when crystallized— copper, gold, sulfur, silver, and platinum are other minerals that are found as native elements. Native Elements Very Few in a Pure State It is rare for native chemical elements to be found in the Earth's crust in a pure state. In general, they must be extracted from other minerals by means of industrial chemical processes. However, they can occasionally be found in rocks in a pure state. Diamonds, for instance, are pure carbon. In Alloys and Compounds As was the case with silicates, it is very difficult to find rocks composed of pure nonsilicate elements—elements with atoms of only one type. The constituent elements of nature, metal and nonmetal, tend to join together and form compounds and alloys. From a chemical perspective, even ice, solidified water, is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Some compounds are used as ores, meaning that they are mined for their constituent elements. For example, pure aluminum is obtained from bauxite. Other compound minerals, however, are used for their specific properties, which can be very different from those of each of their constituent elements. This is the case with magnetite, which is an iron oxide. MAGNETITE COPPER APATITE MALACHITE LIMONITE GYPSUM ROSETTE PYRITE 0.04 inch (1 mm) Both apatite, used as fertilizer, and the semiprecious stone turquoise are phosphates. These materials have a complex structure based on an ion composed of one phosphorus and four oxygen atoms. These ions, in turn, are associated with compound ions of other elements. Gypsum, widely used in construction, is a calcium sulfate that forms in the sea and contains water in its structure. Without water, calcium sulfate forms another mineral, anhydrite, which is also used in construction. Barytine is a sulfate from which the metal barium is extracted. are found in metal ores and are associated with sulfur. Examples of sulfides are pyrite (iron), chalcopyrite (iron and copper), argentite (silver), cinnabar (mercury), galena (lead), and sphalerite (zinc). Sulfides Simpler than silicates, minerals in this group are composed of a complex anion associated with a positive ion. Calcium carbonate (calcite, the main component of limestone) and calcium magnesium carbonate (dolomite) are the most common carbonates. Known in chemical terms as a base, these types of minerals appear through the association of oxide with water. Limonite, an iron ore used as pigment because of its reddish color, and bauxite (or aluminum hydroxide) are among the most abundant hydroxides. Bauxite is the ore from which aluminum, a metal that is becoming more and more widely used, is extracted. ASSOCIATION “FOOL'S GOLD” was an early name for pyrite because of its glitter. ENCRUSTED IN ROCK Here crystals are encrusted in slate, a metamorphic rock. STRUCTURE OF PYRITE The cubic shape of crystals comes from the balanced location of iron and sulfur atoms.

When magma comes to the surface as lava and solidifies relatively quickly, it creates extrusive rocks, such as basalt or rhyolite. On the other hand, when magma seeps into caves or between rock layers and slowly solidifies, intrusive igneous rocks, such as gabbro and granite, are formed. These rocks usually have thicker grains and are less dense than the extrusive ones. They are arranged in structures called dikes, sills, and batholiths beneath the surface. Igneous rocks make up most of the Earth's crust. ASH CONE Composed of pyroclasts of the volcano itself LACCOLITH is located between superficial layers. CALDERA Collapsed volcanic crater covered with water A Complex Process The Earth's crust is 44 miles (70 km) deep at most. Farther down, rocks are molten or semimolten, forming magma that rises through the crust and opens paths through cracks, cavities, or volcanoes. Magma can solidify when it is moving or still or when underground or expelled to the surface. All these characteristics together with different mineral compositions create a wide variety of igneous rocks. SOLID ROCK MUD FLATS LAKE VOLCANIC OUTCROPPING BRANCHING LACCOLITH ERODED LAVA FLOW BENEATH THE SURFACE PLUTONIC ROCKS Most magma is underground in the form of plutons, which undergo a solidification process. This forms intrusive (or plutonic) rocks. When magma intrudes into vertical fissures, the resulting rock formations are called dikes; those between sedimentary layers are sills; and batholiths are masses hundreds of miles long. In general, intrusive rocks crystallize slowly, and their minerals form thick grains. But the solidification process will determine the structure; the rock will be different depending on whether solidification is slow (over millions of years) or fast and whether it loses or gains materials along the way.

Minerals with calcium, iron, and magnesium crystallize first, giving them a dark coloring (olivine, pyroxene). But sodium, potassium, and aluminum crystallize at lower temperatures, remaining in the residual magma until the end of the process. They are present only in pale-colored rock, which crystallizes later. Sometimes different stages of the process can be seen in the same rock. LAST LAYER TO CRYSTALLIZE COOLING OF MAGMA FIRST LAYER TO CRYSTALLIZE RICH IN SODIUM RICH IN CALCIUM ON THE SURFACE VOLCANIC ROCK Volcanic, or extrusive, rocks are those that reach the surface as lava because of volcanic activity. They solidify relatively quickly on the surface. Some, like the obsidians, solidify too quickly to crystallize. This class of rock is distinguished by its viscosity, caused by the low silica content and dissolved gas at the moment of eruption, which give these rocks a particular texture. Highly liquid lava, such as basalt, usually covers large surfaces because it solidifies on the outside while still remaining fluid underground. STOCKS are massive plutons smaller than batholiths.

This is the highest waterfall in North America and the third highest in the world. Yosemite This park has an average elevation of 1,300 to 2,000 feet (400-600 m) above sea level. The geology of the area is mostly composed of a granitic batholith, but five percent of the park is composed of formations from the metamorphism of volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Erosion at different elevations and fracture systems created valleys, canyons, hills, and other current geological formations. The wide separation between fractures and joints is caused by the amount of silica present in the granite and in the metamorphic rocks.

These natural elements cause great changes in the Earth's landscape. Erosion and transportation are processes that produce and spread rock materials. Then, when these materials settle and become compacted, new rocks are created, which in turn will revert to sediment. These are sedimentary rocks: the most widely known rocks, they cover 70 percent of the Earth's surface. By observing sedimentary rocks of different ages, scientists can estimate how the climate and the environment have changed. GLACIAL CIRQUE At the upper end of the valley, the walls erode in a semicircular form. SLOPES Rocks fall from slopes onto glaciers. They are included in the material that makes up the moraine.

GLACIER FINE AND HETEROGENEOUS Glaciers transport rock fragments, which accumulate in moraines. They are made up of a heterogeneous material called till, which, together with rocks, is carried along by the glacier. TRANSPORT OF SEDIMENTS WIND 3 INCHES (10 CM) ICE SAND 1 2 EROSION The wear and movement of materials on the surface through the action of water, wind, or ice. It can start when rocks are broken down by physical or chemical forces. TRANSPORT After erosion, fragments are transported to an area where they will be deposited. In deserts, the wind transports the sand grains, forming dunes; with glaciers, the debris forms frontal and lateral moraines. TILL ERRATICS are large rock fragments that the glacier transports and deposits. INSELBERG A solitary mound less eroded than the flat ground over which it rises DUNE EROSION By transporting sand grains from the crest of the ridge, the wind moves the dunes. The grains can be transported up to 100 feet (30 m) per year. TERMINAL MORAINE Rocks that fall onto the glacier, along with the rock it was already carrying, accumulate at the front of the glacier and form what is called a terminal moraine.

MUSHROOM FORMATION Sand transported by the wind molds stratified shapes such as mushrooms. U-SHAPED VALLEYS Glaciers erode valleys, forming a U shape because erosion is greatest at the bottom. WIND DUNES ACCUMULATED SEDIMENTS Deserts The largest environments sculpted by wind are the deserts. Because of the scarcity of water and the widely varying temperatures, the rock is broken down by physical forces. Rocks fragment and are swept to low-lying areas by occasional water currents. Then sand and mud will be swept away by the wind in a process called deflation. Through this process particles can be transported into semiarid regions. Glaciers These huge ice masses form on the ground, slowly moving downward through the action of gravity. As they advance, they carry away rocks in their path. At the head of a glacier valley, the walls erode in a semicircle, forming what is called a glacial cirque. The simultaneous, progressive erosion of the walls creates a pyramidal horn, or peak.

CLIFF A product of lateral undermining WATERFALLS Softer rock erodes, forming a cave with a rocky ceiling that will finally crumble and fall. SEDIMENTATION When the currents that transport sediment lose energy, the sediment is deposited in layers and distributed over extensive areas. FORMATION OF V-SHAPED VALLEYS Unlike glacial valleys, which are eroded in the shape of a U, river valleys are V-shaped. Rivers Close to their source, rivers flow through areas of high elevation. The water descends there with great force and energy, which enables the current to transport large boulders. At low elevations, rivers flow more smoothly over sediments, forming meanders and eroding laterally. On reaching the coast, rivers deposit sediments and form estuaries or deltas. SOLID ROCK RIVER'S MOUTH Interrupts the shoreline and delivers continental sediments. COASTAL PLAIN A plain that usually lies inward from beach MARINE ABRASION PLATFORM Flat surface created by a receding cliff CAVE Caves are cut into the rock through abrasion. CLIFFS originate through the erosive action of the waves against the base of coastal terrain. Coasts Ocean coasts are the most changing landscapes in the Earth's geography thanks to a process called coastal drift. The elements that build up the coastline—wind, rain, and waves—also erode and mold it. Thus, the waves that bring the sediments that form beaches and carry them away are the same waves that can create or knock down a cliff or cave. Its remnants will be the building material for another beach, along with the sediment that comes from rivers and their deltas. DELTA FORMATION The sediment deposited at the river's mouth creates a delta, an area with sandbars through which the river flows in various directions. ESTUARY Former river valley that is now flooded. It offers the necessary conditions for depositing much sediment. SEDIMENTARY DEPOSIT Accumulation of sediments transported by coastal (longshore) drift ALLUVIAL PLAIN Composed of sediments SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITS BEACH FORMATION Beaches are formed from the gradual deposits of waves in low-energy coastal zones. They can be made of fine sediment, such as mud and sand, or of larger materials, such as boulders. CEMENTATION PROCESS This is the most important process that transforms sediment into rock. Cementation occurs when particles join with the materials precipitated from the water currents. Sedimentary rocks are formed through the union of different minerals that have been dissolved in water. When the water evaporates or cools, the dissolved minerals can precipitate and form deposits that accumulate with other sediments, or they can form rocks on their own. Salts and sandstone are common examples of cemented rocks. INITIAL PHASE FINAL PHASE RIVER Close to the river's source, the current is very strong, and it erodes and digs into the riverbed to form V-shaped valleys. RIVER GREAT DISTANCES A river can transport sediments over great distances. Rivers originate in elevated areas, from which they flow to lower areas and then to the sea. When the current gathers speed, it transports big boulders. When the energy is less, the current carries only smaller rocks. COAST LOCAL DEPOSITS After each wave breaks, the undertow descends the beach slope, creating an accumulation of sand that has been transported by the waves in a process called a coastal current. Sand is also transported by rivers, which deposit sediments in their deltas. WATER 3 FEET (1 M) WAVES BOULDER SAND OR PEBBLES BEACH 30 FEET (10 M) COMPACTION The successive layers of sedimentary deposits compact the lower ones by exerting pressure on them.

Cliffs are created through the erosive action of the waves against the base of coastal terrain. As the erosion progresses, the undermining of the cliff's base leaves higher rock layers jutting outward, which then collapse. The cliff recedes, leaving a flat surface in the form of a bank called an abrasion platform.

Caves have three structures: stalactites (conical structures that hang from the cave ceiling), stalagmites (structures that jut from the cave floor), and columns (created when stalactites and stalagmites join). The cycle of cave formation is called the karst cycle, which lasts a total of around one million years. For this reason, young, active caves have noisy streams and cascades, whereas old caves are silent wonders decorated with stalagmites, stalactites, and columns.

The initial fissures widen not only through this chemical process but also mechanically through the abrasive action of pebbles and other insoluble elements. Water is filtered until it reaches lower levels, leaving in its wake openings arranged in levels and separated by vertical pits and passages that connect the different levels. The Karst Cycle Stalactite Formation Limestone is a rock composed almost exclusively of calcium carbonate, which dissolves in naturally acid water. Rainwater absorbs carbon dioxide from the air and microorganisms from the ground, becoming a weak acid. When filtered, it can dissolve limestone over time. If this water drips into a cave, it loses carbon dioxide to the air and deposits the excess calcium in stalactites and stalagmites, thereby maintaining chemical equilibrium. Stalactites are excellent examples of chemical sedimentary rocks.

Sometimes these sediments bury remains of organisms that can later become fossils, which provide key data about the environment and prehistoric life on Earth. The geologic age of rocks and the processes they have undergone can be discovered through different methods that combine analyses of successive layers and the fossils they contain. Fossils succeeded one another in a definite order, which makes it possible to date past events. The existence of identical fossils on different continents helps establish correlations and assigns the same age to widely separated geographic areas. PRINCIPLE OF SUCCESSION Rock Layers and the Passage of Time Rock layers are essential for time measurement because they retain information not only about the geologic past but also about past life-forms, climate, and more. The principle of original horizontality establishes that the layers of sediment are deposited horizontally and parallel to the surface and that they are defined by two planes that show lateral continuity. If layers are folded or bent, they must have been altered by some geologic process. These ruptures are called unconformities. If the continuity between layers is interrupted, it means that there was an interval of time and, consequently, erosion in the layer below. This also is called unconformity, since it interrupts the horizontality principle. A Fossil's Age Fossils are remains of organisms that lived in the past. Today scientists use several procedures, including carbon-14 dating, to estimate their age. This method makes it possible to date organic remains with precision from as long ago as 60,000 years. If organisms are older, there are other methods for absolute dating. However, within a known area, a fossil's location in a given sedimentary layer enables scientists to place it on an efficient, relative time scale. Following principles of original horizontality and of succession, it is possible to find out when an organism lived. When it dies, an animal can be submerged on a riverbed, protected from oxygen. The body begins to decompose. 1. The skeleton is completely covered with sediments. Over the years, new layers are added, burying the earlier layers. During fossilization, molecules of the original tissue are replaced precisely with minerals that petrify it. 2. Once the water disappears, the fossil is already formed and crystallized. The crust's movements raise the layers, bringing the fossil to the surface. 3. ROCKS AND MINERALS 53 TRILOBITES are extinct arthropods.

SCOTLAND, United Kingdom Latitude 57° N Longitude 04° W Regional Metamorphism As mountains form, a large amount of rock is deformed and transformed. Rocks buried close to the surface descend to greater depths and are modified by higher temperatures and pressures. This metamorphism covers thousands of square miles and is classified according to the temperature and pressure reached. Slate is an example of rock affected by this type of process. Contact Metamorphism Magmatic rocks transmit heat, so a body of magma can heat rocks on contact. The affected area, located around an igneous intrusion or lava flow, is called an aureole. Its size depends on the intrusion and on the magma's temperature. The minerals of the surrounding rock turn into other minerals, and the rock metamorphoses. Dynamic Metamorphism The least common type of metamorphism, dynamic metamorphism happens when the large-scale movement of the crust along fault systems causes the rocks to be compressed. Great rock masses thrust over others. Where they come in contact new metamorphic rocks, called cataclasites and mylonites, are formed. Metamorphic Processes W hen rocks are subjected to certain conditions (high pressure and temperature or exposure to fluids with dissolved chemicals), they can undergo remarkable changes in both their mineral composition and their structure. This very slow process, called metamorphism, is a veritable transformation of the rock. This phenomenon originates inside the Earth's crust as well as on the surface. The type of metamorphism depends on the nature of the energy that triggers the change. This energy can be heat or pressure.

Its tiniest cavities, home to thousands of bacteria, algae, and fungi, are filled with water or air.

Algae (mainly diatoms) also live closest to the surface, where there is most light. Mites, springtails, cochineal insects, insect larvae, earthworms, and others are also found there. Earthworms build tunnels that make the growth of roots easier. Their droppings retain water and contain important nutrients. Different Characteristics Observing the soil profile makes it possible to distinguish layers called horizons. Each layer has different characteristics and properties, hence the importance of identifying the layers to study and describe them. The surface layer is rich in organic matter. Beneath is the subsoil, where nutrients accumulate and some roots penetrate. Deeper down is a layer of rocks and pebbles. Rock Cycle Some rocks go through the rock cycle to form soil. Under the action of erosive agents, rocks from the Earth's crust take on characteristic shapes. These shapes are a consequence partly of the rock's own composition and partly of several effects caused by erosive agents (meteorological and biological) responsible for breaking down rocky material. 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 EARTHWORMS It takes approximately 6,000 earthworms to produce 3,000 pounds (1,350 kg) of humus. BEDROCK The continuous breakdown and erosion of the bedrock helps increase the thickness of the soil. Soil texture also depends to a great extent on the type of bedrock on which it forms. 56 FORMATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF ROCKS Types of Soil In the soil we find bedrock materials that have been greatly altered by air and water, living organisms, and decomposed organic materials. The many physical and chemical transformations that it undergoes produce different types of soil, some richer in humus, other with more clay, and so on. The soil's basic texture depends to a great extent on the type of bedrock from which the soil is formed. O rganisms are born, live, reproduce, and die on a natural layer of soil. From this layer, crops are harvested, livestock are raised, and construction materials are obtained. It establishes the link between life and the mineral part of the planet. Through the action of climate and biological agents, soil forms where rocks are broken down. The time needed for the natural formation of soil with its three basic layers, or horizons. Clouds of dust and ash are released to the atmosphere. Ash and other pyroclastic materials are deposited in layers. These layers compress and harden. Igneous rock cools down and erodes. A volcano expels lava and pyroclastic material. Some sedimentary and metamorphic rocks erode, forming new strata. Heat and pressure can recrystallize the rock without melting it, turning it into another type of rock. Igneous and plutonic rocks form as magma cools and solidifies below the Earth's surface. Magma rises to the surface and comes out as lava through the volcano. If it is hot enough, the rock can turn into magma again. The rock melts to form magma. IGNEOUS ROCK Extrusive rocks form as the lava cools. METAMORPHIC ROCK SEDIMENTARY ROCK IGNEOUS ROCK EROSION UPPER LAYER This layer is dark and rich in nutrients. It contains a network of plant roots along with humus, which is formed from plant and animal residues. The glacier drags sediments. The bare rock and gravel remain. Moss and dwarf shrubs grow. Small trees manage to take root. Animals and plants that die help to enrich the soil. RANKER develops on top of slightly altered bedrock. It is typical in high mountains, especially if it forms on granite or other acidic rocks. SUBSOIL contains many mineral particles from the bedrock. It is formed by complex humus. DESERTIC Arid soil Containing very little humus, it rests directly on mineral deposits and rock fragments. LATERITE Typical tropical soil With abundant rains and humidity in these zones, the soil is well drained. The rain leaves a mix of oxides and hydroxides of aluminum, iron, manganese, nickel, and other minerals in the soil. This represents 70 percent of the world's iron reserves.

Uluru was discovered by Caucasians in 1872 and renamed Ayers Rock in honor of the Australian Prime Minister Henry Ayers. In this enormous sandstone mass, dozens of dream paths traversed by the Aborigines and the paths already traveled by their ancestors in the past converge through a series of myths. In this manner, all the sacred places are connected. On the rock are forms such as Kuniya women and the wounded head of the Liru warrior, among others. The Black Stone of the Ka`bah Located in one corner of the Ka`bah, the Black Stone is the most sacred treasure of the Islamic world. The Ka’bah is a cubic building located in Mecca, toward which Muslims face as they pray five times a day. The stone's exposed surface is 6 x 8 inches (16 x 20 cm), and its pieces are held together by a frame with a silver band. Muslims relate its origin to Adam and say that Abraham and his son Ishmael built the Ka`bah, but it was the Prophet Muhammad who converted Mecca into the sacred center of Islam in the 7th century. ROCKS AND MINERALS 59 58 FORMATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF ROCKS Divine and Worshiped F ormed millions of years ago, some rocks enjoy the privilege of being considered deities. Pagans, Christians, Muslims, and Aborigines of Australia base part of their beliefs on the myths, properties, or legends of a rock. Among the best known are Uluru (Ayers Rock), the Black Stone located in the cube-shaped sepulcher of the Ka`bah, and the rocks of Externsteine, a destination of Christian pilgrimages and a sacred site for many ancient pagan religions. Their origins are described and studied in theology as well as in geology. Resistant to the passing of time, they are transformed into myths that remain to the present. 100 feet (30 m) the height of the Externsteine formation.

ULURU-KATA TJUTA NATIONAL PARK, Australia Latitude 25° S Longitude 131° E The great reddish rock of Uluru was created during the Alice Springs orogeny, 400 million years ago. The sandstone and conglomerates that formed the ancient alluvial fans folded and fractured deeply, turning horizontal layers on their ends. Each crack, protuberance, or groove of a rock has meaning to Aborigines. For example, a rock's orifices symbolize the eyes of a dead enemy.

Their specific characteristics depend on the minerals that constitute them. Based on this information, it is possible to know how rocks gained their color, texture, and crystalline structure. With a little experience and knowledge, people can learn to recognize and identify some of the rocks that they often see. Shapes The final shape that a rock acquires depends to a great extent on its resistance to outside forces. The cooling process and subsequent erosion also influence the formation of rocks. Despite the changes caused by these processes, it is possible to infer information about a rock's history from its shape. Mineral Composition Rocks are natural combinations of two or more minerals. The properties of rocks will change in accordance with their mineralogical composition. For instance, granite contains quartz, feldspar, and mica; the absence of any of these elements would result in a different rock. ROUNDED The wear caused by erosion and transport gives rocks a smooth shape. ANGULAR Rocks have this shape when they have not been worn down. WHITE MARBLE IMPURITY WHITE MARBLE PEGMATITE WHITE MARBLE Fracture When a rock breaks, its surface displays fractures. If the fracture results in a flat surface breaking off, it is called exfoliation. Rocks usually break in locations where their mineral structure changes. Texture refers to the size and arrangement of grains that form a rock. The grains can be thick, fine, or even imperceptible. There are also rocks, such as conglomerates, whose grains are formed by the fragments of other rocks. If the fragments are rounded, there is less compaction, and the rock is therefore more porous. In the case of sedimentary rocks in which the sedimentary cement prevails, the grain is finer. Color The color of a rock is determined by the color of the minerals that compose it. Some colors are generated by the purity of the rock, whereas others are produced by the impurities present in it. Marble, for instance, can have different shades if it contains impurities. GRAIN is the size of the individual parts of a rock, be they crystals and/or fragments of other rocks. A rock's grain can be thick or fine. WHITE If the rock is a marble composed of pure calcite or dolomite, it is usually white. BLACK Various impurities give rise to different shades in the marble. CRYSTALS form when a melted rock cools and its chemical elements organize themselves. Minerals then take the shape of crystals. 0.4 inch (1 cm) 0.4 inch (1 cm) Age Being able to accurately determine the age of a rock is very useful in the study of geology."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"64 CLASSES OF ROCKS F ormed from magma or lava, igneous rocks can be classified according to their composition. This classification specially takes into account: the relative proportion of silica, magnesium, and iron minerals found in these type of rocks; their grain size (which reveals how fast they cooled); and their color. Rocks that contain silica, along with much quartz and feldspar, tend to have pale colors; those with low silica content have dark colors created by iron and magnesium-containing minerals, such as olivine, pyroxene, and amphiboles. A rock's texture is determined by the configuration of its crystal grains. Igneous Rocks ROCKS AND MINERALS 65 Underground: Plutonic or Intrusive Rocks Rocks of this type formed through the solidification of magma masses deep within other rocks. In general, they have undergone a slow cooling process in the Earth's crust, which has permitted the formation of pure mineral crystals large enough to be seen with the unaided eye. Usually they display a compact structure and have low porosity. Depending on the composition of the magma, there are acidic plutonic rocks (rich in silicon) or basic rocks (with low silicon content). Granite is the most common type of intrusive rock. Extrusive Rocks, Products of Volcanoes Extrusive rocks form through the fast cooling of magma on or near the Earth's surface. Their structure and composition are closely related to the volcanic activity in the areas where they emerge. Because they are typically products of a fast solidification process, they usually have a very fine grain. When they are expelled from a volcano, they do not have a chance to crystallize before they cool, so they acquire a vitreous (glasslike) texture. THE MINIMUM DEPTH AT WHICH GRANITE FORMS 1 mile (1.6 km) THE MOST COMMON SHAPE INTO WHICH BASALT CRYSTALLIZES Hexagon PEGMATITE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF GEMS AND RARE METALS. Index GRANITE This rock is formed by big grains of feldspar, quartz, and mica. Its light- colored components indicate an abundance of silicon and that the rock is acidic. Because of its great resistance to wear, granite is often used as a construction material. PERIDOTITE This rock is mainly composed of olivine (which gives it a greenish color) and pyroxene. It is less than 45 percent silicon and is rich in magnesium, a very light metal. It is abundant in the upper layers of the mantle (at a depth of about 40 miles [60 km]) as a residue of old crust. GABBRO This rock contains ferromagnesian minerals, such as olivine, pyroxene, and augite, which form dark-colored crystallizations, and feldspars, which give a white coloring to some of its parts. Gabbro generally solidifies slowly, leaving it with thick grains. PEGMATITE This very abundant, acidic rock has a mineral composition identical to that of granite. However, its solidification process was very slow, thus enabling its crystals to grow to a size of several feet. PUMICE This rock is produced from lava with a high silicon and gas content, which gives it a foamy texture. This explains its porous consistency—acquired during rapid solidification—which enables it to float in water. BASALT This rock forms most of the oceanic crust. Its low silicon content gives it its characteristic dark color (between blue and black). Its rapid cooling and solidification gives it a very fine grain. Because of its hardness, it is used to build roads; it is not, however, used to make paving stones because it is too slippery. OBSIDIAN This rock is black; its shades vary in accordance with its impurities. Because it undergoes rapid cooling, its structure is vitreous, not crystalline; thus, it is commonly called volcanic glass. Strictly speaking, obsidian is a mineraloid. It was often used to make arrowheads. GRANODIORITE This rock is often confused with granite, but it is grayer since it contains larger numbers of quartz and sodic plagioclase crystals than it does feldspar. It has thick grains and contains dark crystals called nodules. MACROPHOTOGRAPHY OF PINK GRANITE PEGMATITE IS NATURALLY SMOOTH. CRYSTAL JOINED BY VITREOUS MASS MACROPHOTOGRAPHY OF GRANODIORITE GEOMETRIC PRISMS These prisms were formed in the Giant's Causeway (Northern Ireland) through contraction, expansion, and rupture of basaltic lava flows that crystallized gradually. Dikes and Sills: Rocks Formed in Seams Some types of igneous rocks are formed from ascending magma that solidifies in seams or fissures. The resulting sheetlike body of rock is called a dike if it has a vertical orientation or a sill if it has a horizontal orientation. The composition of these rocks is similar to those of intrusive and extrusive rocks. In fact, like dikes and sills, intrusive and extrusive rocks can also form in cracks. However, the manner in which the materials in a sill or dike solidify causes them to form crystalline structures different from those of their volcanic and plutonic relatives. PORPHYRITICS These rocks solidify in two phases. In the first, slower phase, thick phenocrystals form. Then in the second phase, the phenocrystals are dragged along by magma, which causes the formation of smaller, vitreous crystals. The name porphyritic alludes to the color purple."},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Old Reefs Paleozoic Coastal Area Current State Boundary Current Coastal Boundary 66 CLASSES OF ROCKS ROCKS AND MINERALS 67 Coral Reefs are rocky structures resistant to the action of waves and to the movement of the water. They are formed and/or colonized by photosynthetic organisms and marine animals, some of which have calcareous skeletons, as in the case of coral polyps. These soft organisms, related to anemones and jellyfish, live in colonies. When their solid calcareous skeletons sediment, they turn into calcite. They live in symbiosis with single-celled algae known as zooxanthellae. FLAT CORAL Corals typically grow in colonies and create reefs, layer by layer.

This process ultimately yields a pearl. Fine pearls are produced by pearl oysters (Pinctada) in the warm, clear waters of tropical seas. FROM SEDIMENT TO ROCK Under pressure from overlying layers, sediments are compacted and lithified, reducing their volume by 40 percent. Other substances dissolved in water (calcite, silica, and iron oxide) fill up the interstices between the particles of sediments, and when the water evaporates, cementation occurs. CORALS IN ARIZONA In the first phase of the Paleozoic Era (500 million years ago), the current mountainous region of the American West was a coastal area with much coral activity. This is how the abundant calcareous formations that can be seen today in Arizona's Grand Canyon originated. These formations also coexist with much younger rocks. Calcareous Skeleton Living Polyp Branched Polyp BRAIN CORAL BRANCH CORAL Layers of Mother- of-Pearl Marine Sediments S edimentary rocks can also form through the accumulation and lithification of organic remains. The most common example is coral reefs, which develop underwater, surrounding the coasts of many temperate seas. Many limestone rocks also originate this way; they are made of calcium carbonate (calcite) or calcium and magnesium (dolomite). Because of their porous consistency, they often serve as repositories for fossil fuels, which are also of organic origin. Other rocks, like coquina, form through the accumulation of fragments of marine shells, lithified over time as materials filled and cemented their interstices."},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"Collection of Detrital Rocks ROCKS AND MINERALS 69 A mong the sedimentary rocks, detrital rocks are the most abundant. They form through the agglomeration of rounded fragments (clasts) of older rocks. Depending on the size of the clasts, they are classified as (from smallest to largest) pelite, lutite and limestone, sandstone, and conglomerates. The analysis of their components, cementation matrix, and arrangement in layers makes it possible to reconstruct the geologic history both of the rocks and of the areas in which they are found. Some break off easily and are used in industrial processes and construction as rock granules, whereas others are appreciated for their toughness and hardness. Conglomerates Most of the grains that compose these rocks are larger than 0.08 inch (2 mm). In some cases, it is possible to identify with the unaided eye the primary rocks from which a conglomerate is formed. As a result, it is possible to determine the areas where the sediments originated. Accumulations of gravel and cementation material can indicate either slopes in the rocks where the conglomerates formed or the action of fluvial currents. All this information makes it possible to reconstruct the geologic history of a rock. Clay, Lime, and Ash These materials form the less porous, fine-grained detritic rocks. Lutites are rocks of clay, composed of particles whose diameter does not exceed 0.0002 inch (0.004 mm). In general, they are compacted and cemented through chemical precipitation. Limestone rocks are also called limolites, named after lime, a sedimentary material with a somewhat thicker grain (up to 0.0025 inch [0.06 mm]). Some rocks composed of volcanic ash have a similar granulation. These rocks are very important in construction. GRAYWACKE has a defined proportion of calcium carbonate, quartz, feldspar, and mica. It differs from common sandstone because it contains a higher amount of cementation materials (more than 15 percent), which form its grain matrix. This makes it more compacted. CHALK Composed of calcite debris of biochemical origin, this mineral originates in the sea near the coast. After being eroded and transported, it accumulates on slopes where it becomes compacted. The chalk we use on blackboards is, in reality, gypsum. COMPACTED ASH It is possible to find one or more layers of fine-grained pyroclastic material (volcanic ash) in many sedimentary rocks. Rocks formed from larger pyroclasts, which solidified in the air during an eruption before they touched the ground, are rarer. Their origin is igneous, but their formation is sedimentary. TUFF is rock that is formed from deposits of volcanic ash that has been cemented together. There are several types: crystalline tuff, which is largely composed of igneous glass; lithic tuff, which contains rock fragments; and hybrid tuff, which is formed from fragmented volcanic material combined with some clay. CLAY (KAOLINITE) When hydrated, it increases in size. MICROPHOTOGRAPH OF BRECCIA 40 % THE REDUCTION IN THE VOLUME OF CLAY AS IT IS COMPACTED CONGLOMERATE Formed by large fragments, they are good examples of sediments that have been compacted after landslides. The irregularity of this specimen's clasts points to a chaotic origin, which could be alluvial in nature or associated with a glacial moraine. BRECCIA Its grains are thick but with straight angles and edges. This shows that the sediments have not traveled far and that cementation has taken place near the area from which the materials originated. A Variety of Sandstones Sandstone is rock composed of grains that are mostly between 0.003 and 0.08 inch (0.06 and 2 mm) in size. Sandstones are classified according to their mineral composition, their level of complexity (or geologic history), and the proportion of cementation material they contain. Quartzarenite (which is more than 95 percent quartz), arkose (which is mostly feldspar), red sandstone (which is cemented by iron compounds), and graywacke belong to this class of rocks. SANDSTONE is made up of small grains of sand that are here stratified by color and texture. This type of sandstone indicates that an alternating process of sedimentation involving two types of particles has occurred. 68 CLASSES OF ROCKS CLAY The substance commonly known as clay is an unconsolidated rock, made of hydrated aluminum silicates and typically full of impurities. Kaolin is the name for pure granular clay; it is soft and white and keeps its color even after it has been fired in a kiln. It has scale-shaped microcrystals and generally contains impurities. ARKOSE possesses a varied composition, although it contains up to 25 percent quartz and feldspar. Generally, it has a porous consistency, and less than one percent of its interstices are empty.

R ROCKS AND MINERALS 73 72 CLASSES OF ROCKS Common Metamorphic Rocks Slates and Phyllites These foliated rocks recrystallized under moderate pressure and temperature conditions. Slate has very fine grains made of small mica crystals. It is very useful in the production of roof tiles, floor tiles, blackboards, and billiard tables. It almost always is formed through low-grade metamorphism in sediments and, less often, from volcanic ash. Phyllite represents a gradation in metamorphism between slate and schist; it is composed of very fine mica crystals, such as muscovite or chlorite. Gneiss Striped rock that usually contains long and granular minerals. The most common types are quartz, potash feldspar, and plagioclase. It can also have smaller amounts of muscovite, biotite, and hornblende. Its characteristic stripes are due to a segregation of light and dark silicates. Gneiss rock, which has a mineral composition similar to that of granite, is formed through sedimentary processes or derived from igneous rocks. However, it can also form through high-grade metamorphism of schists. It is the last rock of the metamorphic sequence. Foliation SLATE Its black color comes from the carbon in organic matter present in sediments. SLATE Because of exfoliation, it tends to break into flat sheets. HORNBLENDE SCHIST It contains some sodium as well as considerable amounts of iron and aluminum. MICACEOUS SCHIST Its characteristic coloring is determined by colorless or white muscovite crystals.

Schist This rock is more prone to foliation, and it can break off in small sheets. It is more than 20 percent composed of flat, elongated minerals, which normally include mica and amphiboles. For schist to be formed, a more intense metamorphism is needed. The different schistose rocks' names and characteristics depend on the predominant mineral that composes them or on the one that produces exfoliation. Among the most important schistose rocks are mica, hornblende, and talc. Because this type of rock has different layers, it has been used in sculpture. GARNETIFEROUS SCHIST The dark red crystals of garnet formed during metamorphism. MARBLE MICROGRAPH Impurities and accessory minerals color the marble. SLATE MICROGRAPHY Composed of foliated or laminated clay minerals GNEISS Heat and pressure can change granite into gneiss. T he classification of metamorphic rocks is not simple because the same conditions of temperature and pressure do not always produce the same final rock. In the face of this difficulty, these rocks are divided into two large groups, taking into account that some exhibit foliation and others do not. During the transformation process, the density of rock increases, and recrystallization can induce the formation of bigger crystals. This process reorganizes the mineral grains, resulting in laminar or banded textures. Most rocks derive their color from the minerals of which they are composed, but their texture depends on more than just their composition."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Incredi b le Petra 74 CLASSES OF ROCKS ROCKS AND MINERALS 75 H istorians from ancient Rome used to talk about a mysterious city of stone. In 1812 Johann Ludwig Burckhardt of Switzerland rediscovered it. Traces of Neolithic civilizations were found in Petra; however, its foundation in the 4th century BC is attributed to the Nabataeans, a nomadic people. The Nabataeans were merchants and raiders who became prosperous by controlling the spice trade. The city, carved in sandstone, knew times of splendor, but it eventually fell into ruin. WINGED LIONS (Interpretation) These carvings were located in the temple of Atargatis, goddess of fertility in the Nabataean culture. ELEPHANTS (Interpretation) Native to Africa or India, elephants were not represented in classic culture. Here, however, they are seen adorning Greek- style capitals. This particular merging of cultures created expressions found nowhere else in the ancient world. Archaeologists find it difficult to date the pieces of art found in Petra. CORINTHIAN CAPITAL (Interpretation) One of the most classic capitals of Greek architecture, along with the Ionic and Doric styles SERAPIS God of prosperity and concealed mysteries. In Egyptian iconography, Serapis has horns. HIDDEN IN THE DESERT Uncertain Origins Petra's architecture is dominated by Greek, Egyptian, and Roman features; however, their symbiosis with Eastern elements is so great that to this day experts find it difficult to establish Petra's origin and dates of construction. The city's exterior adornments contrast with the interior sobriety of its temples. It contained sumptuous public baths that date from a time of splendor (1st century BC). However, most of Petra's population, which reached a peak of 20,000 inhabitants, lived in adobe houses. Temples and Tombs The only way to reach Petra is by foot through a narrow passage among the rocks. The passage is 1 mile (1.5 km) long and, at some points, less than 3.3 feet (1 m) wide. The Treasury (Khasneh) is the first seen upon entering the city, followed by a Roman amphitheater. The buildings are carved into cliffs, and more than 3,000 old tombs have been excavated. The city also has fortifications. Carved in Stone The construction over sandstone respects and takes advantage of the characteristics of the landscape. To create openings, builders used the cracks and fissures that already existed in the rock. The sandstone in Petra is composed of at least two original types of sediments of different colors. Some people believe they are from different geologic phases, but it is more likely that the original sand was made of different grains. A Door Between Worlds The statue represents the god Serapis, whose cult was established in the 4th century BC in both Greece and Egypt. Serapis is of Greek origin, but obelisks and cubic stones, typical Egyptian monuments, also abound in Petra. For a long time, it was believed that Petra was the biblical town of Edom. Its strategic location made it a transit area for Indians and Africans. The Roman and Byzantine empires had a profound influence: Petra was their gateway to the East. Beginning in the 7th century, though, Nabataean culture began to merge with Islamic culture, and it ultimately disappeared.

For instance, the exploitation of Veladero, an open-air gold-and-silver mine located in the province of San Juan in the Argentinean Andes and exploited by the Canadian company Barrick Gold, required more than a decade of research and development before the first ingots were obtained in October 2005. To reach the deposits, roads and housing were built for the workers. The potential environmental impact of the mine was analyzed since explosives had to be used and toxic substances, such as cyanide, were needed for extracting and separating the rock from other metals. Mountains of Gold and Silver ROCKS AND MINERALS 81 PROSPECTING 1 TO 3 YEARS COST: $10 MILLION Prospecting began in 1994. During this phase, the possible existence of a deposit covering a vast area was analyzed. It was necessary to draw maps, conduct studies, make satellite images, and undertake field trips to analyze superficial rocks. 1. 2. BLUEPRINT OF THE MINE 2 TO 5 YEARS COST: $547 MILLION Once the reserves and costs were analyzed, it was necessary to open the mineral deposit and evaluate the environmental impact of the operation. The infrastructure was then built; it included paths, houses, and river diversions. 3. EXPLOITATION 2 TO 5 YEARS COST: $90 MILLION The first phases are involved with field prospecting. During this process, preliminary research is confirmed or revised. Once the existence of the deposit is confirmed, the next step is to establish its dimensions, reserves, yield, and extraction costs.

Some are located in the depths of the Earth, and some show their contents at its surface. Bingham Canyon, a copper mine located in Utah, is not only one of the most important open-air mines but also one of the largest excavations in the world. It is so large that it can be seen from space. It has been in operation since 1903, and it has been excavated in the form of terraces, like those used in agriculture. Its activity never stops, continuing even on weekends and holidays. The manner in which copper is extracted involves not only the use of machinery of extraordinary dimensions but also the use of a hydro-metallurgic chemical process called lixiviation, or leaching. Thanks to this process it is possible to obtain 99.9 percent of copper in its pure state from a copper concentration of 0.02 ounce per pound (0.56 gram per kg) of raw material. ROCKS AND MINERALS 83 1 2 3 How the Metal Is Extracted TERRACING OF THE SURFACE The mine acquires a steplike shape because it is excavated in spiral terraces. The machines can move easily over the terraces, collecting the extracted material. PATHS The roads are well built, and they can withstand loads of up to 1,765 cubic feet (50 cu m) of rock on only one truck.

The rock is removed from the pit and loaded by large shovels onto trucks. Then it is unloaded onto a mobile grinder. The ground rock is removed from the mine on conveyor belts and then sprayed with a solution of water and sulfuric acid. ARRANGEMENT OF THE STACK When on the conveyor belts, the material is taken to a place where it will form a lixiviation pile or stack, and a trickle irrigation system is installed on top of this pile. Sprinklers cover the entire exposed area. The material will spend 45 days here. COPPER RECOVERY The resulting copper solution is collected in conduits and then undergoes a process of electrolytic refining. During this process, electricity passes between two copper plates suspended in the solution; copper from the solution adheres to the sheets as it is separated through electrolysis. 6 ounces/ gallon (45 g/l) OF COPPER IN THE SOLUTION AT THE END OF THE LIXIVIATION PROCESS COPPER CONCENTRATION IN THE RAW MATERIAL 0.56 % 99.9 % COPPER IN A PURE STATE FORMATION OF THE MINE Surface mines take the shape of large terraced pits, which grow ever deeper and wider. Viewed from above, an enormous spiraling hollow can be seen. This is a relatively inexpensive and simple method to extract high-purity materials. LIXIVIATION The hydro-metallurgic process that makes it possible to obtain copper from the oxidized minerals by applying a solution of sulfuric acid and water. Oxidized minerals are sensitive to attack by acid solutions. Thousands of pounds of explosives, trucks and shovels as large as a house, and massive grinding machines that can reduce hard rocks to dust are involved in the extraction process, and rock temperatures are raised to 4,500° F (2,500° C). In this way, copper is extracted from one of the largest open-air mines on the planet. The raw material excavated from the terraces in the mine contains oxidized copper minerals. This material is transported to grinders, which produce rock fragments 1.5 inches (4 cm) in diameter. These materials are placed in a pile that is treated with a solution of water and sulfuric acid. This process is called lixiviation, or leaching. Lixiviation is a hydro-metallurgic treatment that makes it possible to obtain copper present in the oxidized minerals. The treated material begins the process of sulfatation of copper contained in the oxidized minerals. WATER BASIN The phreatic layer, the closest aquifer to the surface below the water table, emerges at the bottom and forms a water basin with a peculiar color because of the copper salts in the deposit.

This irrevocably changed the history of California. 2 3 1850 California became the 31st state of the Union. Slavery was abolished because of the large influx of immigrants and the fear that it would reduce workers' salaries. However, the Fugitive Slave Act was sanctioned by the state. According to this law, every fugitive slave that entered California had to be returned to his or her owner. 1852 When the surface gold was exhausted, more complex technology was required to extract it from the ground. Hydraulic mining, which used water jets, was a technique used for this purpose. Miners then became employees, enduring long workdays. PARTICLES BEING WASHED WASHED PARTICLES DRAGGING Mules dragged large stones, used to break other quartz stones, thus releasing the gold within. SLOPE The water flowed and deposited gold at the serrated bottom. SLUICE BOX Water flowed through the artificial canal, where riffles (barriers) along the bottom of the sluice box caught the gold and let the other material pass through. THEY SHOVELED THE GRAVEL. CHINESE Chinese immigrants, attracted by the prospect of wealth, constituted most of the labor force. PAN The swirling movement of the pan allowed for the separation of sediments, and the gold could be identified by a difference in weight. DRY RIVER In 1853, $3 million was invested to change the course of the Yuba River, which merged with the Sacramento River. The water of the new canal was used to wash the gold. GOLD IN THE SOIL Gold could be found in dry riverbeds as dust, as nuggets, or as small rock fragments. HOPPER The gravel was placed in the hopper and the deposited material was moved with a lever. When water was added, the dirt could be carried away, leaving the gold at the barrier since the density of gold is greater than that of water. RETURN TO THE RIVER Once the water had been used to pan for gold, it was channeled back into the river from which it came. ARTIFICIAL CANAL BY HAND Resources and tools were scarce. Almost everything was done by hand. ENCAMPMENTS Bad living conditions led to the death of many workers; many were also killed by epidemics and illnesses. DRY RIVERBED CHANNELED RIVER DRY RIVERBED FLOW OF IMMIGRANTS In 1848, California had a population of 14,000.

Fortune hunters came from the Americas as well as from Asia, but few were able to achieve their goal of striking it rich. Each year, obtaining gold required a larger investment of time and equipment, and equipment suppliers were the ones who ultimately earned the highest profits.

Once World War II ended, nuclear reactors and their fuels began to be used as sources of energy. To process these minerals, nuclear plants are necessary. They must be built following many safety guidelines, since nuclear energy is considered to be very risky. Accidents like the one in Chernobyl and, more recently, in Tokaimura, Japan, are clear examples of what can happen when control of this form of energy is lost. These images show the structure and heart of a nuclear reactor, the way uranium is processed, and the peaceful uses of this type of energy. FUEL RODS IN EACH GROUP 264 THE NUCLEUS OF THE REACTOR is in the lower part of the safety vessel, in which there are about 200 groups of fuel sheaths sized 0.4 inch (1 cm) in diameter and 13 feet (4 m) in height. USE OF URANIUM IN MEDICINE The application of nuclear energy helps with the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cancer. It can detect alterations long before symptoms develop clinically, which allows for more effective early treatment. REACTOR BUILDING This special building is made of reinforced concrete and steel. It is 210 feet (64 m) high and 148 feet (45 m) wide. It houses and shelters the components of the reactor. It also contains the pressure vessel, four steam generators, a pump (which circulates cooling water around the core), and a compressor (which keeps the water under pressure). URANIUM HANDLING Uranium 235 is the only isotope that is found in a natural state, easily fissionable. For this reason, it is the main fuel used in nuclear power plants. Even though it is rare to find it in the Earth's crust, it can be found in enriching deposits in watercourse beds. Radioactive Minerals PROTECTION GLOVES RAW URANIUM GROUPS OF FUEL RODS THAT GENERATE THE NUCLEAR REACTION CONTROL RODS Human Scale WATER DEPOSIT WATER URANIUM PELLETS FOR USE IN A FUEL ROD Pressure Vessel The nuclear reactor is inserted into a vessel formed by steel that is approximately 1.6 feet (0.5 m) thick. The fuel, which is encapsulated in zirconium alloy sheaths, is located inside the hollow space of the vessel. This design helps to meet one of the first goals in nuclear safety: to prevent radioactive products from leaking into the surrounding environment. Carbon 14 is a method for dating organic fossil samples based on the exponential decay law of radioactive isotopes. After a living organism has been dead for 5,730 years, the amount of 14 C present in its body has decreased by half. Thus, when the amount of latent 14 C is measured in organic materials, it is possible to calculate the amount remaining in the material and, therefore, to calculate when the organism died.

In effect, the atmosphere is a system so complicated that many scientists define it as chaotic. Any forecast can rapidly deteriorate because of the wind, the appearance of a warm front, or an unexpected storm. T hus, the difference continues to grow geometrically, and the reality of the next day is not the one that was expected but entirely different: when there should have been sunshine, there is rain; people who planned to go to the beach find they have to shut themselves up in the basement until the hurricane passes. All this uncertainty causes many people who live in areas that are besieged by hurricanes or tropical storms to live in fear of what might happen, because they feel very vulnerable to changes in weather. It is also true that natural phenomena, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and cyclones, do not in themselves cause catastrophes. For example, a hurricane becomes a disaster and causes considerable damage, deaths, and economic losses only because it strikes a populated area or travels over farmland. Yet in society, the idea persists that natural phenomena equate to death and destruction. In fact, experience shows that we have to learn to live with these phenomena and plan ahead for what might happen when they occur. In this book, along with spectacular images, you will find useful information about the factors that determine weather and climate, and you will be able to understand why long-term forecasts are so complicated. What changes are expected if global warming continues to increase? Could the polar ice caps melt and raise sea levels? Could agricultural regions slowly become deserts? All this and much more are found in the pages of the book. We intend to arouse your curiosity about weather and climate, forces that affect everyone. A Sum of Factors STRONG WINDS AND TORRENTIAL RAINS Between September 20 and September 25, 1998, H urricane Georges lashed the Caribbean, leaving thousands of people homeless. “"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"Climatology GLOBAL EQUILIBRIUM 8-9 PURE AIR 10-11 ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS 12-13 COLLISION 14-15 COLORS IN THE SKY 16-17 SATELLITE IMAGE In this image of the Earth, one clearly sees the movement of water and air, which causes, among other things, temperature variations. T he constantly moving atmosphere, the oceans, the continents, and the great masses of ice are the principal components of the environment. All these constitute what is called the climatic system; they permanently interact with one another and transport water (as liquid or vapor), electromagnetic radiation, and heat. Within this complex system, one of the fundamental varia b les is temperature, which experiences the most change and is the most noticea b le. The wind is important b ecause it carries heat and moisture into the atmosphere. Water, with all its processes (evaporation, condensation, convection), also plays a fundamental role in Earth's climatic system."},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"8 C L IMA T O L OGY WEATHER AND CLIMATE 9 Glo b al Equili b rium T he Sun's radiation delivers a large amount of energy, which propels the Earth's extraordinary mechanism called the climatic system. T he components of this complex system are the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, cryosphere, and biosphere. All these components are constantly interacting with one another via an interchange of materials and energy. Weather and climatic phenomena of the past—as well as of the present and the future—are the combined expression of Earth's climatic system. EVAPORATION T he surfaces of water bodies maintain the quantity of water vapor in the atmosphere within normal limits. PRECIPITATION Water condensing in the atmosphere forms droplets, and gravitational action causes them to fall on different parts of the Earth's surface. SOLAR RADIATION About 50 percent of the solar energy reaches the surface of the Earth, and some of this energy is transferred directly to different layers of the atmosphere. Much of the available solar radiation leaves the air and circulates within the other subsystems. Some of this energy escapes to outer space. Biosphere L iving beings (such as plants) influence weather and climate. T hey form the foundations of ecosystems, which use minerals, water, and other chemical compounds. T hey contribute materials to other subsystems. Lithosphere T his is the uppermost solid layer of the Earth's surface. Its continual formation and destruction change the surface of the Earth and can have a large impact on weather and climate. For example, a mountain range can act as a geographic barrier to wind and moisture. Cryosphere Represents regions of the Earth covered by ice. Permafrost exists where the temperature of the soil or rocks is below zero. T hese regions reflect almost all the light they receive and play a role in the circulation of the ocean, regulating its temperature and salinity. Atmosphere Part of the energy received from the Sun is captured by the atmosphere. T he other part is absorbed by the Earth or reflected in the form of heat. Greenhouse gases heat up the atmosphere by slowing the release of heat to space.

Eruptions also block the rays of the Sun and thus reduce the amount of solar radiation received by the Earth's surface. T his causes cooling of the atmosphere. SMOKE Particles that escape into the atmosphere can retain their heat and act as condensation nuclei for precipitation. WINDS T he atmosphere is always in motion. H eat displaces masses of air, and this leads to the general circulation of the atmosphere. SUN UNDERGROUND CIRCULATION T he circulation of water is produced by gravity. Water from the hydrosphere infiltrates the lithosphere and circulates therein until it reaches the large water reservoirs of lakes, rivers, and oceans. RETURN TO THE SEA MARINE CURRENTS Night and day, coastal breezes exchange energy between the hydrosphere and the lithosphere. HEAT HEAT Sun Essential for climatic activity. T he subsystems absorb, exchange, and reflect energy that reaches the Earth's surface. For example, the biosphere incorporates solar energy via photosynthesis and intensifies the activity of the hydrosphere. Hydrosphere T he hydrosphere is the name for all water in liquid form that is part of the climatic system. Most of the lithosphere is covered by liquid water, and some of the water even circulates through it. 50% TH E A L BEDO OF L IG HT C L OUDS Some gases in the atmosphere are very effective at retaining heat.

Its composition allows it to regulate the quantity and type of solar energy that reaches the surface of the Earth. T he atmosphere, in turn, absorbs energy radiated by the crust of the Earth, the polar ice caps and the oceans, and other surfaces on the planet. Although nitrogen is its principal component, it also contains other gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, ozone, and water vapor. T hese less abundant gases, along with microscopic particles in the air, have a great influence on the Earth's weather and climate. AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE 59° F (15° C) Nitrogen 78% Oxygen 21% Argon 0.93% Other gases 0.03% Carbon dioxide 0.04% GASES IN THE AIR 51% of solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's surface. 4% A small amount of solar radiation is reflected by the oceans and the ground. Safe flights T he absence of meteorological changes in this region makes it safer for commercial flights. High mountains Any mountains higher than 5 miles (8 km) above sea level. T he decrease of oxygen with altitude makes it difficult to breathe above 2.5 miles (4 km). TROPOSPHERE Starts at sea level and goes to an altitude of six miles (10 km). It provides conditions suitable for life to exist. It contains 75 percent of the gases in the atmosphere. Meteorological conditions, such as the formation of clouds and precipitation, depend on its dynamics. It is also the layer that contains pollution generated by human activities. STRATOSPHERE Extends from an altitude of 6 miles to 30 miles (10-50 km). T he band from 12 to 19 miles (20-30 km) has a high concentration of ozone, which absorbs ultraviolet radiation. A thermal inversion is produced in this layer that is expressed as an abrupt temperature increase beginning at an altitude of 12 miles (20 km). MESOSPHERE L ocated between an altitude of 30 to 55 miles (50-90 km), it absorbs very little energy yet emits a large amount of it. T his absorption deficit causes the temperatures to decrease from 60° F to -130° F (20° C to -90° C) in the upper boundary of the mesopause. THERMOSPHERE Found between an altitude of 55 and 300 miles (90- 500 km). T he O 2 and the N 2 absorb ultraviolet rays and reach temperatures greater than 1,800° F (1,000° C).

T he Coriolis effect appears to deflect the trajectory of the winds that move over the surface of the Earth, because the Earth moves beneath the winds.

Changes in Circulation Irregularities in the topography of the surface, abrupt changes in temperature, and the influence of ocean currents can alter the general circulation of the atmosphere. T hese circumstances can generate waves in the air currents that are, in general, linked to the cyclonic zones. It is in these zones that storms originate, and they are therefore studied with great interest. H owever, the anticyclone and the cyclone systems must be studied together because cyclones are fed by currents of air coming from anticyclones. Forces in the upper-air currents, along with surface conditions, may cause air currents to flow together or may split them apart. T he waves in the upper layers are translated into cyclones and anticyclones at ground level. T he velocity creates a difference in air concentration between different systems.

OCCLUDED FRONTS When the cold air replaces the cool air at the surface, with a warm air mass above, a cold occlusion is formed. A warm occlusion occurs when the cool air rises above the cold air. T hese fronts are associated with rain or snow, cumulus clouds, slight temperature fluctuations, and light winds. STATIONARY FRONTS T hese fronts occur when there is no forward motion of warm or cold air—that is, both masses of air are stationary. T his type of condition can last many days and produces only altocumulus clouds. T he temperature also remains stable, and there is no wind except for some flow of air parallel to the line of the front. T here could be some light precipitation. Entire Continents Fronts stretch over large geographic areas. In this case, a cold front causes storm perturbations in western Europe. But to the east, a warm front, extending over a wide area of Poland, brings light rain. T hese fronts can gain or lose force as they move over the Earth's surface depending on the global pressure system. Severe imbalance in the cold front Very dense clouds that rise to a considerable altitude Thick rain clouds A barely noticeable imbalance of a warm front Rain below the front Warm Fronts T hese are formed by the action of winds. A mass of warm air occupies a place formerly occupied by a mass of cold air. T he speed of the cold air mass, which is heavier, decreases at ground level by friction, through contact with the ground. T he warm front ascends and slides above the cold mass. T his typically causes precipitation at ground level. L ight rain, snow, or sleet are typically produced, with relatively light winds. T he first indications of warm fronts are cirrus clouds, some 600 miles (1,000 km) in front of the advancing low pressure center. Next, layers of stratified clouds, such as the cirrostratus, altostratus, and nimbostratus, are formed while the pressure is decreasing. Behind the cold front, the sky clears and the temperature drops. The cold front forces the warm air upward, causing storms. There could be precipitation in the area with warm weather. Cold front A warm front can be 125 miles (200 km) long. A cold front usually covers about 60 miles (100 km). In both cases, the altitude is roughly 0.6 mile (1 km). 125 miles (200 km) As the clouds extend over a region, they produce light rain or snow. The mass of cold air takes the form of a retreating wedge, which has the effect of lifting the warm air as it moves over the mass of cold air. If the warm front moves faster than the retreating wedge of cold air, the height of the advancing warm front continues to increase. Surface warm front KEY Surface cold front Cool air Cold front Warm front Warm air Cold air W hen two air masses with different temperatures and moisture content collide, they cause atmospheric disturbances. When the warm air rises, its cooling causes water vapor to condense and the formation of clouds and precipitation. A mass of warm and light air is always forced upward, while the colder and heavier air acts like a wedge. T his cold-air wedge undercuts the warmer air mass and forces it to rise more rapidly. T his effect can cause variable, sometimes stormy, weather. Cold Fronts T hese fronts occur when cold air is moved by the wind and collides with warmer air. Warm air is driven upward. T he water vapor contained in the air forms cumulus clouds, which are rising, dense white clouds. Cold fronts can cause the temperature to drop by 10° to 30° F (about 5°-15° C) and are characterized by violent and irregular winds. T heir collision with the mass of ascending water vapor will generate rain, snow flurries, and snow. If the condensation is rapid, heavy downpours, snowstorms (during the cold months), and hail may result.

T here are two types of currents: surface and deep. T he surface currents, caused by the wind, are great rivers in the ocean. T hey can be some 50 miles (80 km) wide. T hey have a profound effect on the world climate because the water warms up near the Equator, and currents transfer this heat to higher latitudes. Deep currents are caused by differences in water density. Ocean Currents TIDES AND THE CORIOLIS EFFECT T he Coriolis effect, which influences the direction of the winds, drives the displacement of marine currents. SUBPOLAR ARCTIC CIRCULATING SYSTEM For the last five decades, these currents have been shown to be undergoing dramatic changes. EKMAN SPIRAL explains why the surface currents and deep currents are opposite in direction. DEEP CURRENTS have a vital function of carrying oxygen to deep water.

Differences in specific heat moderate the temperatures of regions close to great masses of water. Water absorbs heat and releases it more slowly than the land does, which is why a body of water can heat or cool the environment. Its influence is unmistakable. Moreover, these differences between the land and the sea are the cause of the coastal winds. In clear weather, the land heats up during the day, which causes the air to rise rapidly and form a low-pressure zone. T his zone draws marine breezes.

T he rays of the Sun strike the surface at a right angle; they are concentrated in a smaller area, so the temperature on average is higher than in the Northern H emisphere. The land is cold, so near the ground the breeze blows toward the ocean. The Earth is hot, and therefore the air rises and is replaced in the lower layers by cool breezes that blow in from the sea. The meeting of the two breezes causes clouds and rain on the continent. The sea is cold because the rays of the Sun heat up the water more slowly than the land. The cool air from the ocean blows toward the coast, toward areas that are warmer. The sea is a little warmer than the land; therefore, the humid air rises.

On the American coast of the South Pacific, the climate is very dry by comparison. 1 Without trade winds In periods that can vary from two to seven years, the trade winds that push the warm water toward the west can be sharply reduced or even fail to occur. As a result, the entire mass moves toward the South American coast. 1 Overcompensation T he return of normal conditions after El Niño can be (although not necessarily) the preamble to an inverse phenomenon called L a Niña. As a consequence of Southern Oscillation pressure levels, the trade winds become stronger than normal. 1 Climate inversion For six months, the normal climatic conditions are reversed. T he temperature of the water and air increases along the coasts of Peru and Ecuador, and the humidity causes heavy rains. 2 A cold current T he total disruption of the masses of warm water off the west coast of South America also generates colder surface temperatures than normal along with high pressure and decreased humidity. 2 Severe drought T he effects of L a Niña are less severe than those of El Niño. Also, the shorter its duration, the more intense it is. It typically begins about halfway through the year and intensifies at the end of the year before weakening around the beginning of the new year. In the Caribbean, L a Niña causes an increase in humidity. 3 El Niño makes itself felt. Southeast Asia suffers a great drought, an increase of pressure, and a decrease in temperature. On the South American coast, strong winds and storms occur in zones that are usually dry; there is flooding and changes in the flora and fauna. 3 A large mass of warm water accumulates on the western coasts of the South Pacific and is sustained by the persistence of the trade winds at the ocean surface.

Light winds usually produce lines of cumulus clouds positioned as if along streets. Such waves can be created by differences in surface heating. Convection The heat of the Sun warms the air near the ground, and because it is less dense than the surrounding air, it rises. Convergence When the air coming from one direction meets air from another direction, it is pushed upward. Geographic elevation When the air encounters mountains, it is forced to rise.

In the latter case, if the water does not have sufficient salt, the incomplete decomposition of organic matter and the significant washing away of nutrients make the soil more acidic. If the water contains a great deal of salt, the salt will remain in the soil, causing a different problem: salinization. Torrential rains raise the level of the water in the rivers and the riverbeds.

Floodplains Floodplains are areas adjacent to rivers or streams that are subject to recurrent flooding.

T he isobars, or lines that connect points of equal pressure, make it possible to estimate the velocity and direction of the wind at ground level. T his information helps forecast the movement of cold or warm air masses. T he letter A indicates an anticyclonic area, which indicates atmospheric stability and that the probability of rain is very low. T he letter B indicates a low-pressure area and presages major atmospheric instability with possible rain. WARM A warm air mass with local storms is advancing. COLD A cold air mass with rain is advancing. Upper-air Map Another type of map, which is used to analyze upper-air weather conditions, is an upper-level, or geopotential, map. On these maps, contour lines connect points located at the same altitude for a certain pressure level (normally 500 hectopascals [hPa]) and correlate with the temperature of the air in the higher layers of the troposphere (at 16,400 feet [5,000 meters] altitude on the 500 hPa map).

In their own way, with rituals and praise, they tried to influence the weather to improve the bounty of the harvest. WEATHER AND CLIMATE 77 The Orient H induism has various weather-related gods. T he most popular is Surya (god of the sun). Next come Chandra (god of the moon), Indra (the god who governs heaven), and Parjanya (god of rain).

SURYA H indu god of the sun. In India the sun personified as Surya was considered to be harmful by the Dravidians of the south but benevolent by the peoples of central regions. T hese peoples attributed great healing power to the god. The Romans T he Romans worshiped many gods because they inherited them from the Greek oracles. T he gods of weather were Jupiter (wise and just, who reigned over the earth), Apollo (the god of the sun), Neptune (the god of the sea and storms), and Saturn (the god of agriculture). Each god had a specific function. As a result, any human activity could suffer or benefit from the attitude of the god in charge of that particular function. T hus, the purpose of ritual worship and sacrifice to the gods was to gain their favor. Egyptians As in all ancient civilizations, the gods of weather were very much a part of Egyptian life. Civilization extended along the banks of the Nile, where water was crucial for survival—that is, where cities, temples, pyramids, and the entire economic life of the kingdom were concentrated. T he weather influenced the rising of the river and the harvests. T herefore the Egyptians venerated Re (the god of the sun), Nut (the god of heaven), Seth (the god of the storm), and T oth (the god of the moon). FUJIN Japanese god of wind. Drawn as a dark monster, covered with leopard skin, he carried a bag of wind on his shoulders. Pre-Columbians T he pre-Columbian population believed water was a gift from the gods. For the Aztecs, T laloc was the god of rain, whereas the Incas called him Viracocha. Among the Mayans, he was known as Chac. H e was the divinity of the peasants because water was the essential factor for stability and organization for these indigenous peoples. T he calendar made it possible to forecast certain astrological events and rainstorms. VIRACOCHA For the Incas, he was all powerful.

T he main cause is an increase in carbon dioxide emissions by industrialized nations during the past 200 years. T his phenomenon has increased the greenhouse effect. It is estimated that the average global temperature has increased more than 1.1° F (0.6° C) between the end of the 19th century and the year 2000. T he consequences of this are already beginning to be noticed. Changes are observed in the global distribution of precipitation: there are regions where there is an increase of rain, and there are other regions where rain is diminishing. T his generates, among other things, a redistribution of fauna and flora, changes in ecosystems, and changes in human activities. WEATHER AND CLIMATE 83 Our planet is going through an accelerated process of global warming because of the accumulation in the atmosphere of a series of gases generated by human activity. T hese gases not only absorb the energy emitted by the surface of the Earth when it is heated by radiation coming from the Sun, but they also strengthen the naturally occurring greenhouse effect, whose purpose is to trap heat. One of the primary agents responsible for the growth of the greenhouse effect is CO 2 (carbon dioxide), which is artificially produced by burning fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, and natural gas). Because of the intensive use of these fuels, there has been a notable increase in the quantity of both carbon and nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. Other aggravating human activities, such as deforestation, have limited the regenerative capacity of the atmosphere to eliminate carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. T hese changes have caused a slow increase in the average annual temperature of the Earth. Global warming, in turn, causes numerous environmental problems: desertification and droughts (which cause famines), deforestation (which further increases climate change), floods, and the destruction of ecosystems. Because all these variables contribute to global warming in complex ways, it is very difficult to predict with precision everything that will happen in the future. Product of Human Activity With the changing patterns of precipitation and the shifting of air-pressure systems, some regions will become more humid, and others will suffer droughts. One of the areas that will become drier will be the western part of North America, where desertification is already affecting agriculture. According to current forecasts, areas in high latitudes, closer to the poles, will go through a rapid warming in the next 40 years. Populations of animals will be forced to emigrate from their habitat to avoid extinction, and other animals, such as the polar bear and emperor penguin, will have trouble subsisting as their habitats disappear. Ocean levels are rising between 0.4 and 0.8 inch (1 and 2 cm) per decade. Some Pacific island nations such as T uvalu have contingency plans for evacuation. Another affected region is the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. T he coral is very sensitive to changes in temperature. At temperatures above a normal 84° F [29 ° C], the coral begin to expel the algae on which they depend for food, and then they die. A Different World Activities, such as the burning of fuels and deforestation, increase the concentration of greenhouse gases. Increase of the natural greenhouse effect of the atmosphere T he modified atmosphere retains more heat emitted by the Earth and thus upsets the natural equilibrium. APPROXIMATE INCREASE Of the Earth's global average temperature from 1860 1.1º F (0.6º C) The discoloration of coral occurs when the temperature exceeds 84° F (29° C).

Barents Sea Bering Strait Hudson Bay Greenland North America Europe EFFECT T he Arctic heats up more rapidly than the global average because of the darkness of the soil and the water, which, once exposed, trap more heat from the atmosphere. Once exposed to the air, the CO 2 is absorbed by the atmosphere. POSSIBLE FLOOD ZONES In the period between 1993 and 2003, some coastlines were reduced by the rise in sea level. 164 feet (50 m) The amount of coastal area lost when sea level rises 20 inches (50 cm) 70% of the freshwater in the world is in Antarctica.

T hey absorb the radiation emitted by the Earth and heat up the atmosphere, further increasing the Earth's temperature. T he melting of glaciers puts more water in the oceans. Antarctica T he Antarctic loses 36 cubic miles (152 cu km) of ice per year, and the western ice sheet is becoming thinner at an accelerating pace. T his is contributing to increases in sea level. Over the long term, the effect on the climate could be disastrous for many regions of the planet. 5. T hese particles rise to the surface, converted into CO 2 . 4. Sunlight reflects from layers of ice. 1. Where the ice is the thinnest, or cracked, radiation penetrates to the ocean. 2. Ice absorbs the heat from sunlight and releases a great quantity of trapped carbon particles. 3. Particles of CO 2 Via cracks in the ice, new marine routes can develop. When ships pass, the cracks rarely close, increasing the process of heat absorption and the release of CO 2 . 80% of Greenland's ice is losing 3 feet (1 m) per year. TEMPERATURE INCREASE It is believed that the increased emission of greenhouse gases will cause an increase in average global temperature of between 3.2° and 7.2° F (1.8° and 4.0° C) over the next 100 years. -25 -15 -5 0 51525"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"WEATHER AND CLIMATE 87 86 C L IMA T E C H ANGE B urning fossil fuel releases into the air chemicals that mix with water vapor and produce acid rain.

This phenomenon is observed every year in polar regions (primarily in the Antarctic) between August and October. Because of this, the Earth is receiving more harmful rays, which perhaps explains the appearance of certain illnesses: an increase in skin cancer cases, damage to vision, and weakening of the immune system. UV RADIATION Ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a radiant form of energy that comes from the Sun. T he various forms of radiation are classified according to the average wavelength measured in nanometers (nm), equivalent to one millionth of a millimeter. T he shorter the wavelength, the greater the energy of the radiation. CFC GASES are a family of gases with multiple applications. T hey are used in refrigeration systems, air-conditioning equipment, and aerosols. WHEN? WHO? HOW? In 1974, it was discovered that industrial chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) affect the ozone layer. Chemists Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland demonstrated that industrial CFCs are the gases that weaken the ozone layer by destroying the ozone molecules. UV-A T hese rays easily penetrate the ozone layer. T hey cause skin wrinkling and aging. HUMAN BEINGS Skin cancer. Damage to vision. Weakening of the immune system. Severe burns. Skin aging. ANIMALS Diseases among farm animals. Destruction of links in the food chain. Increase of skin cancer. PLANTS Destruction of phytoplankton. Inhibition of the photosynthesis process. Changes in growth.

One of the released atoms combines with a molecule of oxygen. T ogether they form a molecule of ozone. T he process can start again with the new oxygen molecule. 1 2 3 4 HOW OZONE IS FORMED T he ozone layer functions as a natural filter, absorbing UV rays. It is popularly called the ozone hole—a decrease or abnormal thinning that occurs in the ozone layer. OZONE LAYER At an altitude of 12 to 19 miles (20 to 30 km), the Earth is surrounded by a stratospheric ozone layer that is of vital importance for life on the surface. T he layer is formed from oxygen molecules through the absorption of ultraviolet light from the Sun. T his reaction is reversible, that is, the ozone can return to its natural state, oxygen. T his oxygen is reconverted into ozone, beginning a continuous process of formation and destruction of these components.

They trap heat and increase the greenhouse effect. That is how the Arctic is warming up; the density of the ice is decreased by melting, and freshwater flows into the ocean, changing its salinity. THINNING OF THE OZONE LAYER The ozone layer protects us from ultraviolet rays, but, because of the release of artificial substances, it is thinning out. This phenomenon is observed each year over Antarctica between August and October and over the North Pole between October and May. Moreover, there is evidence that greater amounts of UV rays at the Earth's surface are destroying or altering vegetable cells and decreasing the production of oxygen. THE EFFECT OF POLAR MELTING The snow-covered sea ice reflects between 85 and 90 percent of the sunlight that strikes it, whereas sea water reflects only 10 percent. For that reason, as the ice and snow melt, many of today's coastlines will become submerged under water, which will cause yet more ice to melt. Rays that pass through the ozone layer The ozone layer stops ultraviolet rays. SURFACE OF THE EARTH Normal thickness of the ozone layer Hole in the ozone More than 10.8° F (6° C) From 9° to 10.8° F (5° to 6° C) From 7.2° to 9° F (4° to 5° C) From 5.4° to 7.2° F (3° to 4° C) From 3.6° to 5.4° F (2° to 3° C) From 1.8° to 3.6° F (1° to 2° C) ACCELERATION OF THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT Ice reflects solar radiation, whereas the soil of jungles, forests, and steppes absorbs the energy and radiates it as sensible heat. This artificially increases the greenhouse effect and contributes to global warming. Long-wave radiation emitted by the Earth is trapped by the atmosphere. Energy is integrated into the climatic system. SURFACE OF THE EARTH Incident rays ATMOSPHERE The Most Responsible The climate of the planet is constantly changing. At present, the average global temperature is approximately 59° F (15° C). Geologic and other types of evidence suggest that in the past the average could have been as low as 45° F (7° C) and as high as 81° F (27° C). Climate change is, in large part, caused by human activities, which cause an increase in the concentration of greenhouse gases. These gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen dioxide and are released by modern industry, by agriculture, and by the burning of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Its atmospheric concentration is increasing: atmospheric carbon-dioxide content alone has grown by more than 20 percent since 1960. Investigators indicate that this warming can have grave implications for the stability of the climate, on which most of the life on the planet depends. THE RISE IN TEMPERATURE In Alaska and western Canada winter temperatures have increased between 5.4° and 7.2° F (3° and 4° C) in the past 50 years. It has been projected that in the next 100 years the Earth's average temperature will increase between 3.2° and 7.2° F (1.8° and 4.0° C).

Acid Rain Rain resulting from the mixture of water vapor in the air with chemical substances typically released by the combustion of fossil fuels. Aerosol Aerosols are very small (liquid or solid) particles suspended in the atmosphere, with varied chemical composition. Aerosols play an essential role in the formation of clouds by acting as condensation nuclei. They are also important to the Earth's radiation balance since they help to increase the reflection and dispersion of radiation coming from the Sun. Air Mass Extensive volume in the atmosphere whose physical properties, in particular the temperature and humidity in a horizontal plane, show only small and gradual differences. An air mass can cover an area of a few million square miles and can have a thickness of several miles. Al b edo A measure of the percentage of radiation reflected by a surface. Altitude Height relative to sea level. Anemometer Instrument for measuring wind velocity. Anticyclone Region where the atmospheric pressure is relatively high compared with neighboring regions. Normally the air above an anticyclone descends, which prevents clouds from forming at medium and high levels of the atmosphere. Hence an anticyclonic system is associated with good weather. Atmosphere The gaseous envelope that surrounds the Earth. Atmospheric Pressure The pressure or weight exerted by the atmosphere at a specific point. Its measurement can be expressed in various units: hectopascals, millibars, inches, or millimeters of mercury (Hg). It is also called barometric pressure. Aurora A phenomenon that is produced in the higher layers of the atmosphere at polar latitudes. An aurora occurs when there is a collision between the electrically charged particles emitted by the Sun and the magnetic field of the Earth. In the Northern Hemisphere, the phenomenon is called the aurora borealis, and in the Southern Hemisphere, it is known as the aurora australis. Avalanche A large mass of snow that flows down the side of a mountain. Barometer An instrument for measuring atmospheric pressure. A decrease in pressure usually means that storms are on the way. Increasing pressure indicates good weather. Beaufort Scale A scale invented at the beginning of the 19th century by a British sailor, Francis Beaufort, for estimating and reporting wind velocity. It is based on the different shapes taken by water waves at different wind velocities, and its graduation goes from 0 to 12. There is also a Beaufort scale for application on land based on observations of the wind's effect on trees and other objects. Car b on Dioxide An odorless, colorless gas emitted in the engine Condensation The process by which water vapor is transformed into liquid by the effect of cooling. Conduction The transfer of heat through a substance by molecular action or from one substance to another it is in contact with. Continentality The tendency of the interior regions of the continents to have more extreme temperature changes than coastal zones. Convection The process by which a heated surface transfers energy to the material (air, water, etc.) above it. This material becomes less dense and rises. Cooler material descends to fill in the void. Air rising as a result of the heating of the ground by the Sun's rays. Coriolis Force A fictitious or apparent force that applies when the Earth is used as a reference frame for motion. It depends upon the latitude and the velocity of the object in motion. In the Northern Hemisphere, the air is deflected toward the right side of its path, and in the Southern Hemisphere, the air is deflected toward the left side of its path. This force is strongest at the poles and does not exist at the Equator. Cyclone A climatic low-pressure system. Desert A hot or cold zone where annual precipitation is less than 1 inch (25 mm).

This generally happens during the night. Dike An earthwork for containing or channeling a river or for protection against the sea. Drizzle A type of light liquid precipitation composed of small drops with diameters between 0.007 and 0.019 inch (0.2 and 0.5 mm). Usually drizzle falls from stratus-type clouds that are found at low altitudes and can be accompanied by fog, which significantly decreases visibility. Drought An abnormally dry climatic condition in a specific area where the lack of water is prolonged and which causes a serious hydrological imbalance. El Niño The anomalous appearance, every few years, of unusually warm ocean conditions along the tropical west coast of South America. Erosion Action in which the ground is worn down by moving water, glaciers, wind, or waves. Evaporation Physical process by which a liquid (such as water) is transformed into its gaseous state (such as water vapor). The reverse process is called condensation. Exosphere The outermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere. Flash Flood Sudden flooding caused by the passage of a large quantity of water through a narrow space, such as a canyon or a valley. Fog Visible manifestation of drops of water suspended in the atmosphere at or near ground level; this reduces the horizontal visibility to less than a mile. It originates when the temperature of the air is near the dew point, and sufficient numbers of condensation nuclei are present. Forecast A statement about future events. The weather forecast includes the use of objective models based on a number of atmospheric parameters combined with the ability and experience of the meteorologist. It is also called weather prediction. Front The transition or contact zone between two masses of air with different meteorological characteristics, which almost always implies different temperatures. For example, a front occurs at the area of convergence between warm humid air and dry cold air. Frontogenesis The process of formation or intensification of a front. This happens when wind forces two adjacent masses of air of different densities and temperatures together, creating a front. It can occur when one of the masses of air, or both, move over a surface that reinforces their original properties. This is common on the east coast of North America or Asia, when a mass of air moving toward the ocean has a weak or undefined boundary. It is the opposite of frontolysis. exhaust of automobiles, trucks, and buses. It is also produced by the combustion of coal and other organic material. Too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere contributes to global warming. Chlorofluorocar b ons Artificial chemical substances often contained in aerosols, refrigerants, and air conditioners. These chemicals are largely responsible for the damage to the ozone layer. Cirrus Wispy cloud formations at altitudes greater than 16,400 feet (5,000 m). Climate The average state of the meteorological conditions of a location considered over a long period of time. The climate of a location is determined by climatological factors: latitude, longitude, altitude, topography, and continentality. Cloud A visible mass of small particles, such as droplets of water and/or crystals of ice, suspended in the air. A cloud is formed in the atmosphere because of the condensation of water vapor onto solid particles of smoke, dust, ashes, and other elements called condensation nuclei. Coalescence The process of growth of drops of water in a cloud. Two drops collide and remain joined after the collision, constituting a bigger drop. This is one of the mechanisms that explains the growth of the size of drops in a cloud until precipitation (rain) is produced. Cold Wave A rapid drop in temperature to the point requiring special protective measures in agriculture, industry, commerce, or social activities."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"94 G L OSSARY WEATHER AND CLIMATE 95 Frost A covering of ice crystals on a cold object. Glo b al Warming The heating of the atmosphere caused by increased concentrations of greenhouse gases due to human activities. Greenhouse Effect A phenomenon explained by the presence of certain components in the atmosphere (primarily carbon dioxide [CO 2 ], water vapor, and ozone) that absorb a portion of the infrared radiation emitted by the surface of the Earth and simultaneously reflect radiative energy back to the surface. This process contributes to the increase in the average temperature near the surface. Gust A rapid and significant increase in wind velocity. The maximum velocity of the wind must reach at least 16 knots (18 miles per hour [30 km/h]), and the difference between the peaks and calm must be at least 10 knots (12 miles per hour [18 km/h]). It generally lasts less than 20 seconds. Hail Precipitation that originates in convective clouds, such as the cumulonimbus, in the form of masses or irregular pieces of ice. Typically hail has a diameter of 0.2 to 2 inches (5 to 50 mm) but may grow significantly larger. The smallest ice fragments—whose diameter is 0.2 inch (5 mm) or less—are called small hailstones, or graupel. Strong upward currents are required inside the clouds for hail to be produced. Heat Wave A period of abnormally hot and uncomfortable weather. It can last from a few days to a number of weeks. Hectopascal A pressure unit equal to 100 pascals and equivalent to 1 millibar—a millibar being equivalent to 0.031 inch (0.8 mm) of ordinary mercury. The millibar (mb) was the technical unit used to measure pressure until recently, when the hectopascal was adopted. The pascal is the unit for pressure in the MKS system, corresponding to the pressure exerted by the unit force (1 newton) on a unit surface (1 square meter—11 square feet); 1,000 hPa = 1,000 mb = 1 bar = 14.5 pounds per square inch. High A prefix describing cloud formations at an altitude between 6,560 and 16,400 feet (2,000 and 5,000 m). Humidity The amount of water vapor contained in the air. Hurricane The name for a tropical cyclone with sustained winds of 64 knots (74 miles per hour [119 km/h]) or more, which develops in the North Atlantic, the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Pacific Northeast. This storm is called a typhoon in the western Pacific and a cyclone in the Indian Ocean. Hygrometer An instrument used to measure humidity. Ice The solid state of water. It is found in the atmosphere in the form of ice crystals, snow, or hail. Jet Streams Air currents high in the troposphere (about 6 miles [10 km] above sea level), where the wind velocity can be up to 90 meters per second (200 miles per hour). This type of structure is seen in subtropical latitudes in both hemispheres, where the flow is toward the east, reaching its maximum intensity during the winter.

Ozone Layer A layer of the atmosphere situated 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 km) above the Earth's surface between the troposphere and the stratosphere. It acts as a filtering mechanism for ultraviolet radiation. Polar Front An almost permanent and very large front of the middle latitudes that separates the relatively cold polar air and the relatively warm subtropical air. Precipitation A liquid or solid, crystallized or amorphous particle that falls from a cloud or system of clouds and reaches the ground. Radiation The process by which energy propagates through a specific medium (or a vacuum) via wave phenomena or motion. Electromagnetic radiation, which emits heat and light, is one form of radiation. Other forms are sound waves. Seaquake An earthquake at the bottom of the ocean, causing a violent agitation of ocean waves, which in some cases reach coastal areas and cause flooding. Snow Precipitation in the form of white or transparent frozen ice crystals, often in the form of complex hexagons. In general, snow falls from stratiform clouds, but it can also fall from cumulus clouds, usually in the form of snowflakes. Stratosphere The layer of the atmosphere situated above the troposphere. Stratus Low clouds that form layers. They often produce drizzle. Synoptic Map A map that shows weather conditions of the Earth's surface at a certain time and place. Thermal Inversion An inversion of the normal reduction in temperature with an increase in altitude. Thermometer An instrument for measuring temperature. The different scales used in meteorology are Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin (or absolute). Tornado A column of air that rotates with great violence, stretching between a convective cloud and the surface of the Earth. It is the most destructive phenomenon in the atmosphere. Tornadoes can occur, under the right conditions, anywhere on Earth, but they appear most frequently in the central United States, between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains. Tropical Cyclone A cyclone without fronts, it develops over tropical waters and has a surface circulation organized and defined in a counterclockwise direction. A cyclone is classified, according to the intensity of its winds, as a tropical disturbance (light ground-level winds), tropical depression (maximum ground-level winds of 38 miles per hour [61 km/h]), tropical storm (maximum winds in the range of 39 to 73 miles per hour [62 to 112 km/h]), or hurricane (maximum ground-level winds exceeding 74 miles per hour [119 km/h]). Troposphere The layer of the atmosphere closest to the ground, its name means “changing sphere,” and this layer is where most changes in weather take place. This is also where most of the phenomena of interest in meteorology occur. Tur b ulence Disorderly motion of air composed of small whirlwinds that move within air currents. Atmospheric turbulence is produced by air in a state of continuous change. It can be caused by thermal or convective currents, by differences in terrain and in the velocity of the wind, by conditions along a frontal zone, or by a change in temperature and pressure. Weather The state of the atmosphere at a given moment, as it relates to its effects on human activity. This process involves short-term changes in the atmosphere in contrast to the great climatic changes that imply more long-term changes. The terms used to define weather include cloudiness, humidity, precipitation, temperature, visibility, and wind. Windward The direction from which the wind is blowing. north and south and the Equator at 0° latitude. Lightning A discharge of the atmosphere's static electricity occurring between a cloud and the ground. Mesosphere The layer of the Earth's atmosphere that lies above the stratosphere.

Some gestures communicate more than words ever could, like these clasped hands, which seek comfort in the face of fear of the unknown. The picture was taken Oct. 8, 2005, when aftershocks were still being felt from the strongest earthquake ever to strike Kashmir, in northern India. Those clasped hands symbolize terror and panic; they speak of fragility and helplessness, of endurance in the face of chaos. Unlike storms and volcanic eruptions, earthquakes are unpredictable, unleashed within seconds, and without warning. They spread destruction and death, forcing millions to flee from their homes. The day after the catastrophe revealed a terrifying scene: debris everywhere, a number of people injured and dead, others wandering desperately, children crying, and over three million survivors seeking help after losing everything. Throughout history Earth has been shaken by earthquakes of greater or lesser violence. These earthquakes have caused great harm. One of the most famous is the earthquake that rocked San Francisco in 1906. Registering 8.3 on the Richter scale, the temblor left nearly three thousand dead and was felt as far away as Oregon to the north, and Los Angeles in southern California. T he purpose of this book is to help you better understand the causes of fractures and the magnitude and violence of the forces deep within the earth. The full-color, illustrated book you hold in your hands contains shocking scenes of cities convulsed by earthquakes and volcanoes, natural phenomena that, in mere seconds, unleash rivers of fire, destroy buildings, highways and bridges, and gas and water lines and leave entire cities without electricity or phone service. If fires cannot be put out quickly, the results are even more devastating. Earthquakes near coastlands can cause tsunamis, waves that spread across the ocean with the speed of an airplane. A tsunami that reaches a coast can be more destructive than the earthquake itself. On Dec. 26, 2004, the world witnessed one of the most impressive natural disasters ever. An undersea quake with a magnitude of 9 on the Richter scale shook the eastern Indian Ocean, causing tsunamis that reached the coastal areas of eight Asian nations, causing about 230,000 deaths. The earthquake was the fifth strongest since the invention of the seismograph. Satellite images show the region before and after the catastrophe. T hroughout history, nearly all ancient peoples and large societies have thought of volcanoes as dwelling places of gods or other supernatural beings to explain the mountains' fury. Hawaiian mythology, for instance, spoke of Pele, the goddess of volcanoes, who threw out fire to cleanse the earth and fertilize the soil. She was believed to be a creative force. Nowadays, specialists try to find out when a volcano might start to erupt, because within hours after an eruption begins, lava flows can change a lush landscape into a barren wilderness. Not only does hot lava destroy everything in its path, but gas and ash expelled in the explosion also replace oxygen in the air, poisoning people, animals, and plants. Amazingly, life reemerges once again from such scenes of destruction. After a time, lava and ash break down, making the soil unusually fertile. For this reason many farmers and others continue to live near these “smoking mountains,” in spite of the latent danger. Perhaps by living so close to the danger zone, they have learned that no one can control the forces of nature, and the only thing left to do is to simply live. The Power of Nature Kashmir, 2005 Farmer Farid Hussain, 50, grasps the hand of his wife, Akthar Fatma, after the earthquake that rocked the Himalayas on the Indian subcontinent. Eighty thousand people were killed, and thousands of families were left homeless."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"OCEAN TRENCHES 16-17 WRINKLES IN THE EARTH 18-19 FOLDS 20-21 WHEN FAULTS RESOUND 22-23 Continuous Movement I n the volatile landscape of Volcano National Park in Hawaii, the beginning and end of life seem to go hand in hand. Outpourings of lava often reach the sea. When the molten rock enters the water, the lava quickly cools and hardens into rock that becomes part of the coastline. By this process, volcanic islands grow constantly, and nothing stays the same from one moment to another. One day rivers of lava blaze down the volcano's slopes, and the next day there are new, silver- colored rocks. The ongoing investigation of lava samples under the microscope helps volcanologists discover the rock's mineral composition and offers clues about how the volcano may behave.

This vast mass of molten rock contains dissolved crystals and water vapor, among other gases, and it is known as magma. When part of the magma rises toward the Earth's surface, mainly through volcanic activity, it is called lava. As soon as it reaches the surface of the Earth or the ocean floor, the lava starts to cool and solidify into different types of rock, according to its original chemical composition. This is the basic process that formed the surface of our planet, and it is the reason the Earth's surface is in constant flux. Scientists study lava to understand our planet better. is the average temperature of liquid lava. 1,800º F (1,000º C) TYPES OF LAVA Basaltic lava is found mainly in islands and in mid-ocean ridges; it is so fluid that it tends to spread as it flows. Andesitic lava forms layers that can be up to 130 feet (40 m) thick and that flow very slowly, whereas rhyolitic lava is so viscous that it forms solid fragments before reaching the surface. Streams of Fire Lava is at the heart of every volcanic eruption. The characteristics of lava vary, depending on the gases it contains and its chemical composition. Lava from an eruption is loaded with water vapor and gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. As these gases are expelled, they burst into the atmosphere, where they create a turbulent cloud that sometimes discharges heavy rains. Fragments of lava expelled and scattered by the volcano are classified as bombs, cinders, and ash. Some large fragments fall back into the crater. The speed at which lava travels depends to a great extent on the steepness of the sides of the volcano. Some lava flows can reach 90 miles (145 km) in length and attain speeds of up to 30 miles per hour (50 km/hr). Rock Cycle Once it cools, lava forms igneous rock. This rock, subjected to weathering and natural processes such as metamorphism and sedimentation, will form other types of rocks that, when they sink back into the Earth's interior, again become molten rock. This process takes millions of years and is known as the rock cycle. Mineral Composition Lava contains a high level of silicates, light rocky minerals that make up 95 percent of the Earth's crust. The second most abundant substance in lava is water vapor. Silicates determine lava's viscosity, that is, its capacity to flow. Variations in viscosity have resulted in one of the most commonly used classification systems of lava: basaltic, andesitic, and rhyolitic, in order from least to greatest silicate content. Basaltic lava forms long rivers, such as those that occur in typical Hawaiian volcanic eruptions, whereas rhyolitic lava tends to erupt explosively because of its poor fluidity. Andesitic lava, named after the Andes mountains, where it is commonly found, is an intermediate type of lava of medium viscosity. INTENSE HEAT Lava can reach temperatures above 2,200º F (1,200º C). The hotter the lava, the more fluid it is. When lava is released in great quantities, it forms rivers of fire. The lava's advance is slowed down as the lava cools and hardens. SOLID LAVA Lava solidifies at temperatures below 1,700º F (900º C). The most viscous type of lava forms a rough landscape, littered with sharp rocks; more fluid lava, however, tends to form flatter and smoother rocks.

COOLING The first crust formed as it was exposed to space and cooled. Earth's layers became differentiated by their density. WARMING Earth warmed again, and the glaciers retreated, giving way to the oceans, in which new organisms would be born. The ozone layer began to form. METEORITE COLLISION Meteorite collisions, at a rate 150 times as great as that of today, evaporated the primitive ocean and resulted in the rise of all known forms of life. The oldest rocks appeared. CONTINENTS The first continents, made of light rocks, appeared. In Laurentia (now North America) and in the Baltic, there are large rocky areas that date back to that time. Hypothesis of a first, great glaciation. 1.8 BILLION YEARS AGO FOLDING IN THE TERTIARY PERIOD The folding began that would produce the highest mountains that we now have (the Alps, the Andes, and the Himalayas) and that continues to generate earthquakes even today. 60 MILLION YEARS AGO The Long History of the Earth T he nebular hypothesis developed by astronomers suggests that the Earth was formed in the same way and at the same time as the rest of the planets and the Sun. It all began with an immense cloud of helium and hydrogen and a small portion of heavier materials 4.6 billion years ago. Earth emerged from one of these “small” revolving clouds, where the particles constantly collided with one another, producing very high temperatures. Later, a series of processes took place that gave the planet its present shape. Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago. In the beginning it was a body of incandescent rock in the solar system. The first clear signs of life appeared in the oceans 3.6 billion years ago, and since then life has expanded and diversified. The changes have been unceasing, and, according to experts, there will be many more changes in the future. From Chaos to Today's Earth When the first crust cooled, intense volcanic activity freed gases from the interior of the planet, and those gases formed the atmosphere and the oceans. 3.8 BILLION YEARS AGO 2.3 BILLION YEARS AGO THE AGE OF THE SUPER VOLCANOES STABILIZATION The processes that formed the atmosphere, the oceans, and protolife intensified. At the same time, the crust stabilized, and the first plates of Earth's crust appeared. Because of their weight, they sank into Earth's mantle, making way for new plates, a process that continues today. “SNOWBALL” EARTH ARCHEAN EON PROTEROZOIC EON FRAGMENTATION The great landmass formed that would later fragment to provide the origin of the continents we have today.

Volcanoes on land and volcanic activity in the mid-ocean ridges generate new rock, which becomes part of the crust. The rocks at the bottom of the crust tend to melt back into the rocky mantle. Earth's crust The air and most of the weather events that affect our lives occur only in the lower layer of the Earth's atmosphere. This relatively thin layer, called the troposphere, is up to 10 miles (16 km) thick at the equator but only 4 miles (7 km) thick at the poles. Each layer of the atmosphere has a distinct composition. The Gaseous Envelope Composed mainly of molten iron and nickel among other metals at temperatures above 8,500º F (4,700° C). The inner core behaves as a solid because it is under enormous pressure. Composition similar to that of the crust, but in a liquid state and under great pressure, between 1,830° and 8,130° F (1,000° and 4,500° C). THE MID-OCEAN RIDGES The ocean floor is regenerated with new basaltic rock formed by magma that solidifies in the rifts that run along mid-ocean ridges. THE CONTINENTAL SHELF In the area where the oceanic crust comes in contact with a continent, igneous rock is transformed into metamorphic rock by heat and pressure. KEY Sedimentary Rock PLUTONS Masses of rising magma trapped within the Earth's crust. Their name is derived from Pluto, the Roman god of the underworld. INTERNAL ROCK The inside of a mountain range consists of igneous rock (mostly granite) and metamorphic rock. GRANITIC BATHOLITHS Plutons can solidify underground as masses of granite. COASTAL ROCK Lithified layers of sediments, usually clay and pebbles, that come from the erosion of high mountains. OCEANIC ISLANDS Some sedimentary rocks are added to the predominantly igneous rock composition. MOUNTAIN RANGES Made up of the three types of rock in about equal parts.

To reach the Earth's center—which, in spite of temperatures above 12,000° F (6,700° C), is assumed to be solid because of the enormous pressure exerted on it—a person would have to burrow through four well-defined layers. The gases that cover the Earth's surface are also divided into layers with different compositions. Forces act on the Earth's crust from above and below to sculpt and permanently alter it.

The Atlantic Ocean was formed in this way. Continental granite The number of years it will take for the continents to drift together again. 2 inches (5 cm) Typical distance the plates travel in a year. The Journey of the Plates W hen geophysicist Alfred Wegener suggested in 1910 that the continents were moving, the idea seemed fantastic. There was no way to explain the idea. Only a half-century later, plate tectonic theory was able to offer an explanation of the phenomenon. Volcanic activity on the ocean floor, convection currents, and the melting of rock in the mantle power the continental drift that is still molding the planet's surface today. Convection currents of molten rock propel the crust. Rising magma forms new sections of crust at divergent boundaries. At convergent boundaries, the crust melts into the mantle. Thus, the tectonic plates act like a conveyor belt on which the continents travel.

That idea proved inaccurate. The seven tectonic plates contain portions of ocean beds and continents. They drift atop the molten mantle like sections of a giant shell. Depending on the direction in which they move, their boundaries can converge (when they tend to come together), diverge (when they tend to separate), or slide horizontally past each other (along a transform fault). PANGEA African Plate"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Inside and Outside the Ridge The abyssal (deep-ocean) plains of the Atlantic are the flattest surfaces on Earth; for thousands of miles, the elevation varies by only about 10 feet (3 m). The plains are made mostly of sediment. Variations in the ocean's depth are mainly the result of volcanic activity, not just within the mid- Atlantic Ridge but elsewhere as well. A spongy layer of rock several dozen miles wide rises above the rift. As the layer fractures and moves away from the fissure, it solidifies into angled blocks that are parallel to the fissure and separated by dikes. Thus the ocean widens as the ridge spreads. The magma exists in a fluid form 2 miles (3.5 km) below the crest of the ridge. Magnetic Reversals The Earth's magnetic field changes direction periodically. The magnetic north pole changes places with the magnetic south pole. Rock that solidified during a period of magnetic polarity reversal was magnetized with a polarity opposite that of newly forming rocks. Rocks whose magnetism corresponds to the present direction of the Earth's magnetic field are said to have normal polarity, whereas those with the opposite magnetic polarity are said to have reversed polarity. The constant generation of new ocean crust along rift zones powers a seemingly endless process that generates new lithosphere that is carried from the crest of the ridges, as if on a conveyor belt. Because of this, scientists have calculated that in about 250 million years, the continents will again join and form a new Pangea as they are pushed by the continually expanding ocean floor. Ocean plates are in contact with land plates at the active boundaries of subduction zones or at passive continental boundaries (continental shelves and slopes). Undersea subduction zones, called ocean trenches, also occur between oceanic plates: these are the deepest places on the planet. AFRICA EUROPE SOUTH AMERICA OCEAN MOUNTS Isolated volcanic cones.

Formation of the Himalayas The highest mountains on Earth were formed following the collision of India and Eurasia. The Indian Plate is sliding horizontally underneath the Asiatic Plate. A sedimentary block trapped between the plates is cutting the upper part of the Asiatic Plate into segments that are piling on top of each other. This folding process gave rise to the Himalayan range, which includes the highest mountain on the planet, Mount Everest (29,035 feet [8,850 m]). This deeply fractured section of the old plate is called an accretion prism. At that time, the Asian landmass bent, and the plate doubled in thickness, forming the Tibetan plateau. A portion of the crust subjected to a sustained horizontal tectonic force is met by resistance, and the rock layers become deformed. The outer rock layers, which are often more rigid, fracture and form a fault. If one rock boundary slips underneath another, a thrust fault is formed. 1 2 3 430 Million Years CALEDONIAN OROGENY Formed the Caledonian range. Remnants can be seen in Scotland, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and Canada (which all collided at that time). HERCYNIAN OROGENY Took place between the late Devonic and the early Permian periods. It was more important than the Caledonian Orogeny. It shaped central and western Europe and produced large veins of iron ore and coal. This orogeny gave rise to the Ural Mountains, the Appalachian range in North America, part of the Andes, and Tasmania. Trilobites 300 Million Years MATERIALS Mostly granite, slate, amphibolite, gneiss, quartzite, and schist. MATERIALS High proportions of sediment in Nepal, batholiths in the Asiatic Plate, and intrusions of new granite: iron, tin, and tungsten. Distortions of the Crust The crust is composed of layers of solid rock. Tectonic forces, resulting from the differences in speed and direction between plates, make these layers stretch elastically, flow, or break. Mountains are formed in processes requiring millions of years. Then external forces, such as erosion from wind, ice, and water, come into play. If slippage releases rock from the pressure that is deforming it elastically, the rock tends to return to its former state and can cause earthquakes.

This phenomenon is seen along Cardigan Bay on the ancient coast of Wales. SANDSTONE 20 CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT Folds T he force that forms the mountains also molds the rocks within them. As the result of millions of years of pressure, the layers of crust fold into strange shapes. The Caledonian Orogeny, which began 450 million years ago, created a long mountain range that joined the Appalachian mountains of the United States to the Scandinavian peninsula. All of northern England was lifted up during this process. The ancient Iapetus Ocean once lay between the colliding continents. Sedimentary rocks from the bed of this ocean were lifted up, and they have kept the same forms they had in the past. THREE CONTINENTS The Caledonian orogeny was formed by the collision of three ancient continents: Laurasia, Gondwana, and Baltica. In between them, the Iapetus Ocean floor contained sediments that now form the bedrock of the coast of Wales. 1.

Following the great earthquake that leveled San Francisco in 1906, this system has been studied more than any other on Earth. It is basically a horizontal transform fault that forms the boundary between the Pacific and North American tectonic plates. The system contains many complex lesser faults, and it has a total length of 800 miles (1,300 km). If both plates were able to slide past each other smoothly, no earthquakes would result. However, the borders of the plates are in contact with each other. When the solid rock cannot withstand the growing strain, it breaks and unleashes an earthquake. Fatal Crack F aults are small breaks that are produced along the Earth's crust. Many, such as the San Andreas fault, which runs through the state of California, can be seen readily. Others, however, are hidden within the crust. When a fault fractures suddenly, an earthquake results. Sometimes fault lines can allow magma from lower layers to break through to the surface at certain points, forming a volcano. VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 23 22 CONTINUOUS MOVEMENT When the Faults Resound Streambeds Diverted by Tectonic Movement Through friction and surface cracking, a transform fault creates transverse faults and, at the same time, alters them with its movement. Rivers and streams distorted by the San Andreas fault have three characteristic forms: streambeds with tectonic displacement, diverted streambeds, and streambeds with an orientation that is nearly oblique to the fault. Fault borders do not usually form straight lines or right angles; their direction along the surface changes. The angle of vertical inclination is called “dip.” The classification of a fault depends on how the fault was formed and on the relative movement of the two plates that form it. When tectonic forces compress the crust horizontally, a break causes one section of the ground to push above the other. In contrast, when the two sides of the fault are under tension (pulled apart), one side of the fault will slip down the slope formed by the other side of the fault. Relative Movement Along Fault Lines Fault plane 350 miles (566 km) The distance that the opposite sides of the fault have slipped past each other, throughout their history. 140 years NORTH AMERICAN PLATE PACIFIC PLATE The average interval between major ruptures that have taken place along the fault.

Displaced Streambed The streambed looks “broken” along its fault line. 1 Normal Fault This fault is the product of horizontal tension. The movement is mostly vertical, with an overlying block (the hanging wall) moving downward relative to an underlying block (the footwall). The fault plane typically has an angle of 60 degrees from the horizontal. 2 Reverse Fault This fault is caused by a horizontal force that compresses the ground. A fracture causes one portion of the crust (the hanging wall) to slide over the other (the footwall). Thrust faults (see pages 18-19), are a common form of reverse fault that can extend up to hundreds of miles. However, reverse faults with a dip greater than 45° are usually only a few yards long. 3 Oblique-Slip Fault This fault has horizontal as well as vertical movements. Thus, the relative displacement between the edges of the fault can be diagonal. In the oldest faults, erosion usually smoothes the differences in the surrounding terrain, but in more recent faults, cliffs are formed. Transform faults that displace mid-ocean ridges are a specific example of oblique-slip faults. Strike-Slip Fault In this fault the relative movement of the plates is mainly horizontal, along the Earth's surface, parallel to the direction of the fracture but not parallel to the fault plane. Transform faults between plates are usually of this type. Rather than a single fracture, they are generally made up of a system of smaller fractures, slanted from a centerline and more or less parallel to each other. The system can be several miles wide.

A volcano's shape depends on its origin, how the eruption began, processes that accompany the volcanic activity, and the degree of danger the volcano poses to life in surrounding areas. LAVA DOME The sides are formed by the accumulation of “hard” lava, made viscous by its high silicon content. Instead of flowing, it quickly hardens in place. STRATOVOLCANO (COMPOSITE VOLCANO) Nearly symmetrical in appearance, formed by layers of fragmented material (ash and pyroclasts) between lava flows. A stratovolcano is structured around a main conduit, although it may also have several branch pipes. This is usually the most violent type of volcano. SHIELD VOLCANO The diameter of these volcanoes is much greater than their height. They are formed by the accumulation of highly fluid lava flows, so they are low, with gently sloping sides, and they are nearly flat on top.

CALDERA VOLCANO Large basins, similar to craters but greater than 0.8 mile (1 km) across, are called calderas. They are found at the summit of extinct or inactive volcanoes, and they are typically filled with deep lakes. Some calderas were formed after cataclysmic explosions that completely destroyed the volcano. Others were formed when, after successive eruptions, the empty cone could no longer hold up the walls, which then collapsed. THE MOST COMMON Stratovolcanoes, or composite cones, are strung along the edges of the Pacific Plate in the region known as the “Ring of Fire.” FISSURE VOLCANOES Long, narrow openings found mainly in mid-ocean ridges. They emit enormous amounts of highly fluid material and form wide slopes of stratified basaltic stone. Some, such as that of the Deccan Plateau in India, cover more than 380,000 square miles (1 million sq km). CHAPEL OF ST.

The most potent explosions often result from thousands of years of accumulation of magma and gas, as pressure builds up inside the chamber. Other volcanoes, such as Stromboli and Etna, reach an explosive point every few months and have frequent emissions. u THE ESCAPE When the mounting pressure of the magma becomes greater than the materials between the magma and the floor of the volcano's crater can bear, these materials are ejected.

Local terms for lava include “aa,” viscous lava flows that sweep away sediments, and “pahoehoe,” more fluid lava that solidifies in soft waves. STROMBOLIAN The volcano Stromboli in Sicily, Italy, gave its name to these high- frequency eruptions. The relatively low volume of expelled pyroclasts allows these eruptions to occur approximately every five years. HAWAIIAN Volcanoes such as Mauna Loa and Kilauea expel large amounts of basaltic lava with a low gas content, so their eruptions are very mild. They sometimes emit vertical streams of bright lava (“fountains of fire”) that can reach up to 330 feet (100 m) in height. FISSURE Typical in ocean rift zones, fissures are also found on the sides of composite cones such as Etna (Italy) or near shield volcanoes (Hawaii). The greatest eruption of this type was that of Laki, Iceland, in 1783: 2.9 cubic miles (12 cu km) of lava was expelled from a crack 16 miles (25 km) long. VULCANIAN Named after Vulcano in Sicily. As eruptions eject more material and become more explosive, they become less frequent. The 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz expelled tens of thousands of cubic yards of lava and ash. VESUVIAN Also called Plinian, the most violent explosions raise columns of smoke and ash that can reach into the stratosphere and last up to two years, as in the case of Krakatoa (1883).

None of this served to warn of the terrible explosion to come, and some even took trips to see the volcano's “pyrotechnics.” AFTER A crater nearly 4 miles (6.4 km) in diameter was left where the volcano had been. About 1927, new volcanic activity was observed in the area. In 1930, a cone emerged. Anak Krakatoa (“daughter of Krakatoa”) appeared in 1952; it grows at a rate of nearly 15 feet (4.5 m) per year.

Days or weeks may pass between eruptions. Most of these spectacular phenomena are found in Yellowstone National Park (U.S.) and in northern New Zealand. CONVECTION FORCES This is a phenomenon equivalent to boiling water. The heat of a magma chamber warms water in the cavity, the chamber fills, and the water rises to the surface.

SPURTING SPRAY The water spurts out of the cone at irregular intervals. The lapse between spurts depends on the time it takes for the chambers to fill up with water, come to a boil, and produce steam. 3. BURSTING FORTH The water rises by convection and spurts out the main vent to the chimney or cone. The deepest water becomes steam and explodes outward. 2. MOUNTING PRESSURE The underground chambers fill with water, steam, and gas at high temperatures, and these are then expelled through secondary conduits to the main vent. 1. HEATED WATER Thousands of years after the eruption of a volcano, the area beneath it is still hot. The heat rising from the magma chambers warms water that filters down from the soil. In the subsoil, the water can reach temperatures of up to 518° F (270° C), but pressure from cooler water above keeps it from boiling.

They are formed from coral reefs that grew along the sides of ancient volcanoes that are now submerged. As the coral grows, it forms a barrier of reefs that surround the island like a fort. How does the process work? Gradually, volcanic islands sink, and the reefs around them form a barrier. Finally, the volcano is completely submerged; no longer visible, it is replaced by an atoll. FORMATION OF AN ATOLL WHAT ARE CORALS? FORMATION OF A VOLCANIC ISLAND ATOLLS AND VOLCANIC ISLANDS AROUND THE WORLD Corals are formed from the exoskeletons of a group of Cnidarian species.

VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 43 Split Down the Middle Part of Iceland rests on the North American Plate, which is drifting westward. The rest of Iceland is on the Eurasian Plate, drifting eastward. As tectonic forces pull on the plates, the island is slowly splitting in two and forming a fault. The edges of the two plates are marked by gorges and cliffs. Thus, the ocean bed is growing at the surface. The magma that emerges at the surface comes from a series of central volcanoes separated by fissures. Birth of an Island On Nov. 15, 1963, an undersea volcanic eruption off the southern coast of Iceland gave rise to the island of Surtsey, the newest landmass on the planet. The eruption began with a large column of ash and smoke. Later, heat and pressure deep within the Earth pushed part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge to the surface. The island kept growing for several months, and today it has a surface area of 1.0 square mile (2.6 sq km). The island was named after Surtur, a fire giant from Icelandic mythology.

Volcanologists study eruptions from airplanes and satellites, and they film volcanic activity from far off. However, to study the inner workings of a volcano up close, they must scale near-vertical cliffs and face the dangers of lava, gas, and mudslides. Only then can they take samples and set up equipment to detect tremors and sounds. VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 49 Field Measurements Monitoring a volcano includes gathering and analyzing samples and measuring various phenomena. Seismic movements, varying compositions of gases, deformations in the rock, and changes in electromagnetic fields induced by the movement of underground magma can all provide clues to predict volcanic activity. SAMPLING OF VOLCANIC GASES Gas and water vapor dissolved in magma provides the energy that powers eruptions. Visible emissions, such as sulfur and steam, are measured, as are invisible gases. Analyzing the gases' composition makes it possible to predict the beginning and end of an eruption. TEMBLORS OR EARTHQUAKES Portable seismographs are used to detect movements in the ground within 6 miles (10 km) of the volcano that is being studied. These tremors can give clues about the movements of the magma. GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (GPS) Movements in the magma cause hundreds of cracks in the cone. A GPS system records images continuously and analyzes the deformation over a period of time. LAVA COLLECTION The study of lava can determine its mineral composition and its origin. Lava deposits are also analyzed because the history of a volcano's eruptions can give clues about a future eruption. LAVA TEMPERATURE is measured with a thermometer called a Thermopar; glass thermometers would melt from the heat. Temperatures of water and of nearby rocks are other variables to take into account. TILTOMETERS These are placed on the slopes of a volcano to record soil changes that precede an eruption. Points are determined (A-B) to monitor how pressure from the magma deforms the surface between them.

One danger is posed by the volcanic material that flows down the sides of the volcano (lava flows and mudslides), and the other danger is from the volcano's pyroclastic material, especially ash. Ash fallout can bury entire cities. Experts have developed an effective series of prevention and safety measures for people living in volcanic areas. These measures greatly reduce the highest risks. VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 51 Preparations for Disaster Before an Eruption It is best to get informed about safety measures, evacuation routes, safe areas, and alarm systems before a volcanic eruption. Other safety measures include stocking up on nonperishable food, obtaining gas masks and potable water, and checking the load-bearing capacity of roofs. Evacuation of Nearby Areas In the immediate area (within 12 miles [20 km]) of the volcano, evacuation is the only possible safety measure. Returning home will be possible only when permission is given. Keep in mind that it takes a long time for life to return to normal after an evacuation. Areas of Falling Ash Most of the population lives outside the volcano's range, but ash from an eruption can become highly volatile and fall over wide areas. Wind can carry ash to other areas, so the best preventive efforts are focused on warning people about what to do in case of falling ash. 12 miles (20 km) 60 miles (100 km) 12 miles (20 km) Considered to be the critical distance from a volcano in emergency relief efforts. HIGHER ELEVATIONS These are the preferred sites for evacuations from volcanic eruptions. High ground is safe from lahars and lava flows, and if there is shelter there, it is also safe from rains of ash. AT HOME It is best to stay indoors during an ashfall. One of the main precautions is to provide for potable drinking water, because the usual water supply will be interrupted because of pollution risks, especially if the water supply comes from lakes or rivers in the area. WIND AND RAIN Wind is a risk factor that spreads volatile ash over a large area so that settlements at a distance greater than 60 miles (100 km) can be affected. The greatest danger posed by falling ash is that it can mix with rain falling on the roofs of houses and form a heavy mass that will collapse the buildings. LAHARS AND PYROCLASTIC FLOWS Lahars (mudflows) can form from rainwater or melting snow. Volcanic danger zones often have strategies to divert rivers and reduce the volume of water in dams and reservoirs. ASH ON THE ROOF Ash should be removed immediately (before it rains) so the roof does not collapse. DO NOT WASH WITH WATER. After the ashfall, washing with water will form a sticky and heavy paste that will be very hard to remove. WATER TANK Roof-mounted water tanks should be disconnected and covered until the roof has been cleared of ashes. DOORS AND WINDOWS It is best to always leave doors and windows shut tightly, as airtight as possible, for as long as the ashfall continues. MASKS Use masks and special ash-protective clothing when outdoors. AVOID DRIVING If you must drive, do so slowly and turn on your headlights. It is best to leave the car parked in an enclosed space or under cover. CHILDREN If children are at school, do not go to pick them up: they will be safe there. STAY CALM To breathe, cover your face with a handkerchief soaked in water and vinegar. INFORMATION Listen to the radio at all times.

Most of the deaths during this tragedy were originally blamed on the ash that buried parts of the neighboring settlements (Herculaneum and Stabiae, as well as Pompeii). Now, though, the eruption is believed to have produced the typical “burning clouds” of a Plinian eruption: Flames of incandescent ash and gases were expelled at high speeds by the eruptive pressure. Suspended moist particles charged the air with electricity, causing an intense electric storm, whose flashes of lightning would have been the only source of light under the ashfall. Since then Vesuvius has had a dozen other important eruptions. The worst killed 4,000 people in 1631. The first volcanology observatory in the world was installed at Vesuvius in 1841. The Violent Awakening A t noon on Aug. 24, AD 79, Mount Vesuvius erupted near the coast of Naples Bay. The Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum were completely buried in ashes and pyroclasts, in what would become one of the worst natural tragedies of ancient times. Many details from that day have reached us thanks to the narrative of Pliny the Younger. His well-known description of the eruption column as “shaped like a pine” caused this type of eruption to be named after him: a “Plinian eruption.” Buried in One Day 10 A.M.

Because these things happened about once a year without any consequences, the inhabitants of Pompeii continued with their normal lives. The public forum was filled with people. The festivities of Isis were celebrated in the temple of Apollo. THE ERUPTION. Suddenly Vesuvius spewed out a huge column of smoke, lava, and ash that formed a pyroclastic flow moving toward Pompeii. People ran in all directions seeking refuge in houses. The roughness of the sea made escape by water impossible. POMPEII'S FORUM This was the political, religious, and commercial heart of the city. Every day the forum was alive with Pompeii's citizens, as it was on August 24. 2 1 P.M.

When the plaster hardened, the surrounding layers of ash were removed, leaving the outlines or molds of the bodies. There were frescoes on the walls showing obscene images and pictures of drunken customers. Food included large quantities of nuts, olives, bread, cheese, and onions. The funnel-shaped roofs were used to collect rainwater. Wine was served in small cups called “carafes.” Slaves worked in the kitchens, and there were utensils similar to those we use today. Clients seeking protection or favors were received in the atrium or central patio. Romans were more than fond of feasts. A dinner for the whole family, which normally began at four in the afternoon, could last for more than four hours. Meals were sumptuous affairs, and no one left until completely satisfied. Pompeii's wine was famous throughout Rome. Kept in pitchers, it was always served watered down. The Romans sometimes added flavorings, commonly including honey and pepper. Good Eating and Drinking THE THERMOPOLIUM The typical bar had a long marble tabletop with embedded containers in which food could be kept warm. Objects and human bodies were found under Pompeii's ashes, preserved in the position in which the disaster surprised them. These valuable testimonies to the past have made possible the reconstruction of daily life in ancient Rome. The House of the Faun was one of the most luxurious villas in Pompeii. In the House of the Faun 3 THE FORM, UNTOUCHED Making plaster casts allowed precise reconstructions of the people's postures at the time of the disaster, and we have been able to learn details such as the hairstyles and dress of these people. Animal forms and other organic objects have also been reconstructed. Today the use of resins and silicones makes it possible to obtain even greater detail. In 1709, some of Pompeii's artifacts were found buried under volcanic ash, and that started a treasure hunt. It was not until 1864, though, that reconstruction and conservation of materials began with the work of Giuseppe Fiorelli. The exhibits that are the most fascinating to people who visit Pompeii's ruins today (about two million people every year) are his reconstructions of the bodies. As in That Moment 1 THE CATASTROPHE Several corpses were covered by volcanic ash, which had accumulated in layers and later hardened. The bodies had decomposed, but their forms were molded in the volcanic rock. There were several types of food and drink establishments in Pompeii, from food vendors in the streets to luxury services. These food places served many different social purposes but acted primarily as places for businessmen to meet. They were run mostly by slaves, men as well as women.

Until that day, it was not known that the mountain was a volcano because it had been inactive for over 300 years. This was one of the first eruptions to be recorded: Pliny the Younger stated in one of his manuscripts that he had seen how the mountain exploded. He described the gas and ash cloud rising above Vesuvius and how thick, hot lava fell. Many people died because they inhaled the poisonous gases. AD 79 370 miles (600 km) away from the epicenter of the eruption, and it was so thick that it hid the Sun for two days. The ashfall covered an area of 193,051 square miles (500,000 sq km).

The eruption caused the deaths of about 2,000 people who lived in the surrounding area, and it destroyed nine settlements. It was the worst volcanic disaster in Mexico's history. Also known as the Mount Fuji of the American continent. During the 1980 explosion, 1,315 feet (401 m) of the mountain's top gave way through a fault on its side. A few minutes after the volcano began its eruption, rivers of lava flowed down its sides, carrying away the trees, houses, and bridges in their path. The eruption destroyed whole forests, and the volcanic debris devastated entire communities. Even though Krakatoa began to announce its forthcoming eruption with clouds of vapor and smoke, these signs, instead of preventing a disaster, became a tourist attraction. When the explosion took place, it destroyed two thirds of the island. Stones shot from the volcano reached a height of 34 miles (55 km)- beyond the stratosphere. A crater 4 miles (6.4 km) in diameter opened a chasm 820 feet (250 m) deep. Land and islands were swept bare. The lava advanced, and it appeared that it would take everything in its path. Volcanologists decided that Heimaey Island, south of Iceland, should be evacuated. But a physics professor proposed watering the lava with seawater to solidify or harden it. Forty-seven pumps were used, and, after three months and 6.5 million tons (6 million metric tons) of water, the lava was stopped, and the port was saved. The eruption began on January 23 and ended on June 28. A burning cloud and a thick mass of ash and hot lava were shot from this small volcano that completely destroyed the port city of Saint-Pierre. Most striking is the fact that this destruction took place in only a few minutes. The energy released was so great that trees were uprooted. Almost the entire population died, and only three people survived, one of them because he was trapped in the city jail. After giving off fumes for seven months, Tambora erupted, and the ensuing catastrophe was felt around the globe. The ash cloud expanded to more than the previous one in 1906, caused severe material damage. The eruptions were responsible for more than 2,000 deaths from avalanches and lava bombs. Additionally, the 1944 eruption took place during World War II and caused as much damage as the eruption at the beginning of the 20th century had, because it flooded Somma, Atrio de Cevallo, Massa, and San Sebastiano. With this last activity, the Vesuvius volcano ended the cycle of eruptions it began in 1631. This explosion, along with T he lava falls and flows, sweeping away everything in its path. This happens in a slow, uninterrupted way, and the lava destroys entire cities, towns, and forests and claims thousands of human lives. One of the most famous examples was the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, which wiped out two cities and two cultures, those of Pompeii and Herculaneum. In the 20th century, the eruption of Mount Pelée destroyed the city of Saint-Pierre in Martinique in a few minutes and instantly killed almost its entire population. Volcanic activity also seems to be closely related to changes in climate. Historic Eruptions There is a strongly supported theory that relates climate changes to volcanic eruptions. The idea of linking the two phenomena is based on the fact that explosive eruptions spew huge amounts of gases and fine particles high into the stratosphere, where they spread around the Earth and remain for years. The volcanic material blocks a portion of solar radiation, reducing air temperatures around the world. Perhaps the most notable cold period related to volcanic activity was the one that followed the eruption of Tambora in 1815. Some areas of North America and Europe had an especially harsh winter.

The Earth's crust does not give outward signs of all the movement within it. Rather energy builds up from these movements within its rocks until the tension is more than the rock can bear. At this point the energy is released at the weakest parts of the crust. This causes the ground to move suddenly, unleashing an earthquake.

At a certain point along the fault, they catch on each other. Tension begins to increase between the plates. 2 Tension Versus Resistance Because the force of displacement is still active even when the plates are not moving, the tension grows. Rock layers near the boundary are distorted and crack. 3 Earthquake When the rock's resistance is overcome, it breaks and suddenly shifts, causing an earthquake typical of a transform-fault boundary. SEISMIC WAVES transmit the force of the earthquake over great distances in a characteristic back-and- forth movement. Their intensity decreases with distance.

Ninety percent originate in the first 62 miles (100 km). Those originating between 43 and 190 miles (70 and 300 km) are considered intermediate. Superficial earthquakes (often of higher magnitude) occur above that level, and deep- focus earthquakes occur below it. BASED ON FOCUS DEPTH High-speed waves that travel in straight lines, compressing and stretching solids and liquids they pass through. Primary Waves The seismic station registers both waves. SPEED IN DIFFERENT MATERIALS Trepidatory Located near the epicenter, where the vertical component of the movement is greater than the horizontal. Oscillatory When a wave reaches soft soil, the horizontal movement is amplified, and the movement is said to be oscillating. Types of Earthquakes Although earthquakes generally cause all types of waves, some kinds of waves may predominate. This fact leads to a classification that depends on whether vertical or horizontal vibration causes the most movement. The depth of the epicenter can also affect its destructiveness. TRAJECTORY OF P AND S WAVES The Earth's outer core acts as a barrier to S waves, blocking them from reaching any point that forms an angle greater than 105° from the epicenter. P waves are transmitted farther through the core, but they may be diverted later on. Thus they are detected at points that form an angle of greater than 140° from the epicenter. The ground is compressed and stretched by turns along the path of wave propagation. Speed of surface waves in the same medium. 1.9 miles per second (3.2 km/s) appear on the surface after the P and S waves reach the epicenter.

The forces produced by these waves can be broken down into simpler wave types to study their effects. Elastic Waves Different Types of Waves There are basically two types of waves: body waves and surface waves. The body waves travel inside the Earth and transmit foreshocks that have little destructive power. They are divided into primary (P) waves and secondary (S) waves.

Measuring an Earthquake EMS 98 SCALE In use since 1998 throughout the European Union and other countries that use the protocol, including those of northern Africa. This scale describes the intensity of earthquakes in European contexts, where the most modern construction may be found side by side with ancient buildings. Earthquakes there can have widely varying effects. The scale has 12 points that combine magnitude readings with levels of destruction. Richter Scale In 1935, seismologist Charles Richter designed a scale to measure the amplitude of the largest waves registered by seismographs. An important feature of this scale is that the levels increase exponentially. Each point on the scale represents 10 times the movement and 30 times the energy of the point below it. Temblors of magnitude 2 or less are not perceptible to humans. This scale is the most widely used in the world because it can be used to compare the strength of earthquakes apart from their effects.

The waves, however, are barely 1.5 feet (0.5 m) high, and a boat may cross over them without the crew even noticing. A large earthquake or volcanic eruption can cause a tsunami, which means “wave in the harbor” in Japanese. Tsunamis travel very fast, up to 500 miles per hour (800 km/h). On reaching shallow water, they decrease in speed but increase in height. A tsunami can become a wall of water more than 33 feet (10 m) high on approaching the shore. The height depends partly on the shape of the beach and the depth of coastal waters. If the wave reaches dry land, it can inundate vast areas and cause considerable damage. A 1960 earthquake off the coast of Chile caused a tsunami that swept away communities along 500 miles (800 km) of the coast of South America.

Earthquake records, called “seismograms,” are produced by instruments called “seismographs,” which basically capture the oscillations of a mass and transform them into signals that can be measured and recorded. An earthquake is usually analyzed by means of three seismographs, each oriented in a unique direction at a given location. In this way one seismograph detects the vibrations produced from north to south, another records those from east to west, and a third detects vertical vibrations, those that go up and down. With these three instruments, a seismic event can be reconstructed. Precision Instruments WILMORE PORTABLE SEISMOMETER A sensitive mass vibrates and moves to the rhythm of the seismic energy inside this tube-shaped mechanism. An electromagnet translates this vibration to electric signals, which are transmitted to a computer that records the data. 1980 W Seismic Wave Seismometers in History Modern seismometers have digital mechanisms that provide maximum precision. The sensors are still based on seismic energy moving a mechanical part, however, and that is essentially the same principle that operated the first instrument used to evaluate earthquakes. It was invented by a Chinese mathematician almost 2,000 years ago. Beginning with his invention, the mechanism has been perfected to what it is today. JOHN MILNE British geologist and engineer (1850-1913), created a needle seismograph, a forerunner of current seismographs, and related earthquakes to volcanism. ROBERT MALLET From Dublin, Ireland (1810- 81). Carried out important studies on the speed of the propagation of earthquakes, even before having experienced one. RICHARD OLDHAM British (1858-1936). Published a study in 1906 on the transmission of seismic waves, in which he also proposed the existence of the Earth's core. Pioneers of seismology The defining principle of modern seismology emerged from relating earthquakes to the movement of the continents, but that did not take place until well into the 20th century. Starting in the 19th century, however, many scholars contributed elements that would be indispensable. BOSCH-OMORI SEISMOMETER Is a horizontal pendulum with a pen that makes a mark directly on a paper roll. With it, Omori, a Japanese scientist, registered the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. 1906 SPRING Allows the pivot and mass to move vertically (vibrating movement). ROTATING DRUMS Move the roll at a constant and precise speed. CLOCK AND RECORDER Take the signal, synchronize it, and convert it. PIVOT Supports and maintains an axis. It can have a hinge. HOW IT WORKS The oscillating mass vibrates when an earthquake takes place. The “dragons,” joined to the pendulum by a rigid bar, hold small balls in a delicate equilibrium. OSCILLATING PENCIL Moves to the rhythm of the vibrations amplified by the mechanism.. SEISMOGRAM The record of amplitude on the paper strip. SUSPENDED MASS Moves according to the direction of the waves of the earthquake and in proportion to their strength. MOVEMENT SENSOR The floating mass is displaced and moves a part inside an electromagnet. Variations produced in the magnetic field are converted into signals. CONNECTING CABLE Transmits the electric signals that are generated. SUSPENSION The small vibrations of the ground will move the base more. HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT HENG'S SEISMOSCOPE The first known seismometer was Chinese. The metallic pendulum mass hung from the cover of a large bronze jar. The small balls fell from the mouths of the dragons to the mouths of the frogs, depending on the direction of the seismic movement. Some of these models were 6 feet (2 m) tall. 123 ZHANG HENG Chinese mathematician, astronomer, and geographer (AD 78-139), also invented the odometer, calculated the number pi as the square root of 10 (3.16), and corrected the calendar. PORTABLE SEISMOMETER Their strong structure allowed these seismometers to be installed in the field. This model translated movement to electric impulses so the signal could be transmitted over some distance. 1950 How a Seismograph Works The Earth's tremors produce movements in the mass that serves as a sensor. If the pivot is hinged, it allows movements in only one direction: horizontally or vertically, depending on the sensitivity and calibration of the spring. These movements are transformed into electric or digital signals to give versatility in processing and recording the data. HORIZONTAL MOVEMENT ANCHORED BASE The greater the degree of suspension, the greater the sensitivity of the mechanism."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"80 STUDY AND PREVENTION Continuous Movement H umankind has tried throughout history to find a way to predict earthquakes. Today, this is done through the installation of seismic observatories and of various field instruments that gather information and compare it to the data sent by scientists from other locations. Based on these records, it is possible to evaluate the chances that a great earthquake is developing and act accordingly. SEISMOMETER Registers ground vibrations, their amplitude, and the direction in which they are produced. A seismometer can detect even the smallest tremor. Some, such as those pictured here, are powered by solar energy. Placement of a Creep Meter To measure the relative movement between the ends, two posts are fixed, one at each side of the fault, 6 feet (2 m) under the ground, or over the concrete base, at a fixed angle (but not at a right angle). Placement of the Seismometer The movement of the sensor mechanism, located under the ground, is converted into electric signals that are transmitted either to the recording module located on the surface or to computers. Earthquakes cannot be predicted For a prediction system to be acceptable, it must be accurate and trustworthy. Therefore, it must have a small level of uncertainty regarding location and the timing, and it must minimize errors and false alarms. The cost of evacuating thousands of people, of providing lodging for them, and of making up for their loss of time and work for a false alarm would be unrecoverable. At this time there is no trustworthy method for predicting earthquakes. CREEP METER Measures the movement between earthquakes or time interval between the two boundaries of a fault. It includes a tension system with a calibrated mechanism. Any movement between the ends alters the magnetic field. NETWORK OF NETWORKS Findings in an area can have repercussions at a great distance. The immediate availability of data allows for linked work. VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 81 GPS The global positioning system (GPS) receiver picks up signals from the satellites and transmits them to the observatories. Because these signals register the receivers' exact locations, a change in their position over time indicates a movement in the crust. Observing from a Distance Seismologists place instruments at fault lines in earthquake-prone areas. Later, at the seismologic observatory, the information taken by field instruments is compiled, and any significant change is noted. If anything suggests that an earthquake is about to take place, emergency services are alerted. Most of these instruments are automatic, and they send digital data through the telephone system. Seismologic Networks Installing complex detection systems would not be of much use if the systems worked in an isolated manner and were not able to share the information they generated. There are national and international seismologic networks that, by means of communications technology, send their observations to other areas that might be affected. LABORATORY Networking at the research centers allows for the comparison of data and provides a global vision that broadens the predictive power of science. SATELLITES Some are used by the GPS systems, but others are critical because they take photographs with extreme accuracy, and they are thus able to record indicators that can be communicated quickly to the base. MAGNETOMETER The magnetic field of the Earth changes when the tensions between rocks vary. Therefore, a change in magnetism can indicate tectonic movement. The magnetometer can distinguish between these changes and those that are more general.

During an earthquake, the ends opposite the eaves act as a counterbalance to achieve equilibrium. Suspension System So that a building will suffer only small oscillations during an earthquake, it is isolated and built in a large trench, separated by special devices. In addition, because the higher floors move more than the lower ones, mechanical dampers are emplaced diagonally so as to be more highly tensioned on top than on the bottom. This makes the structure as a whole more flexible, but it also offers resistance to sudden variations. VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 83 82 STUDY AND PREVENTION Stable Buildings I n cities located in seismic areas, buildings must be designed and constructed with an earthquake-resistant structure that can adequately withstand the movements caused by an earthquake. Foundations are built with damping so that they can absorb the force of the seismic movement. Other buildings have a large metallic axis, around which the stories of the building can oscillate without falling. Currently the amount of knowledge on the effect of earthquakes on structures, as well as knowledge on the behavior of different materials, allows for the construction of less-vulnerable buildings. CEMENT STEEL TUBE There are many ways to design an earthquake- resistant structure: the distribution of walls, the joints between beams and columns, and geometric simplicity. There are also earthquake simulators, large platforms that shake a structure to test it. The simulators are used to test materials and study the forces that act on them. A building's true earthquake resistance, though, can be proven only when it has been built and has survived actual earthquakes.

They are five stories tall, and higher sections of the building are smaller than lower parts. The pagodas are held up by a central pillar that acts as the only support for the building. During a quake, each floor balances independently, without tr ansmitting the oscillating force to the other floors. GOJU Fifth floor SHIJU Fourth floor SANJU Third floor NIJU Second floor SHOJU First floor SHINBASIRA Central pillar THE INTELLIGENT BUILDING When an earthquake is detected, a computer-controlled system provides variable compression to the dampers, which absorb the movements according to the height of the floor and the intensity of the vibrations. BASE ISOLATION A system made of steel disks, interspersed with plates made of a soft material, softens the transmission of seismic movements from the ground to the building. DAMPERS Are made of pistons filled with oil. They reduce the force of horizontal movement. STRUCTURE To avoid imbalances, the upper elements of a structure must be located over only a few axes, without any isolated vertical segments. AVOIDANCE OF OFF-CENTER JOINTS If the beam remains still when the wall moves, the joint breaks. Forces spread out over an axis with flexible material.

Disaster seems inevitable, but, though it is inevitable, much can be done to diminish the extent of the catastrophe. Residents of earthquake-prone areas have incorporated a series of preventive measures to avoid being surprised and to help them act appropriately at home, at the office, or outdoors. These are basic rules of behavior that will help you survive. VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 85 On Guard Prevention If you live in an earthquake- prone area, familiarize yourself with the emergency plans for the community where you live, plan how your family will behave in the event of an earthquake, know first aid, and know how to extinguish fires. LIGHTS Have emergency lighting, flashlights, a transistor radio, and batteries on hand. SECURING OBJECTS Secure heavy objects such as furniture, shelves, and gas appliances to the wall or to the floor. BREAKERS Have a breaker installed, and know how to shut off the electricity and the gas supply. FIRST AID Learn first aid, and participate in community earthquake-response training. FOOD AND WATER Store drinking water and nonperishable food. FIRST-AID KIT Keep a first-aid kit, and keep your vaccinations up to date. AT HOME It is essential that the home be built following regulations for earthquake-resistant construction and that someone be in charge of shutting off the electricity and gas supplies. AT THE OFFICE Offices are usually located in areas conducive to bringing large groups of people together. Thus it is recommended that you remain where you are and not rush to the exits. When people panic, there is a greater probability of their being crushed by a crowd than by a building, especially in buildings that contain a lot of people. IN PUBLIC PLACES When you are outside, it is important to keep away from tall buildings, light poles, and other objects that could fall. The safest course of action is to head to a park or other open space. If the earthquake takes you by surprise while you are driving, stop and remain in the car, but make sure you are not close to any bridges. Do not drink tap water because it might be polluted. Toxic or flammable materials must not be in danger of spilling. Objects that could fall because of movement should be attached to the wall. Determine safe spots under doorframes, next to a pillar, or under a table. Do not light matches or flames: use flashlights. If you are near an exit, leave the building and walk away. Do not block doorways. Know where emergency equipment, such as fire extinguishers, hoses, and axes, is located. Stay away from buildings, walls, utility poles, and other objects that could fall. Fires are frequently more dangerous than the earthquake itself. They can easily get out of control and spread through the city. If you are in a vehicle, stop in the safest place possible (away from large buildings, bridges, and utility poles). Do not leave your car unless it becomes necessary to do so. Head toward open spaces such as squares and parks, and move away from any trees to the extent possible. Stay away from windows and balconies. Fixing breaks in water and gas lines is a priority. Do not use elevators: the electricity might be cut off. In case of evacuation, stairs are the safest place, but they could become filled with people. Mark escape routes and keep them free of obstacles. Follow the instructions of civil defense officers. Do not approach the coastline because of the possibility of a tsunami. Also avoid rivers, which could develop strong currents. TRANSPORTATION It is important to keep access routes to affected areas open to ensure entry by emergency teams. RESCUERS The first priority after an earthquake is to search for survivors.. DOGS Specially trained animals with protective helmets and masks can search for people under the rubble. It is good to designate a leader who can guide others. Form a human chain to prevent getting lost and to prevent accidents. Do not run on the street; doing so will cause panic. During an earthquake As soon as you feel the earth under your feet begin to move, look for a safe place, such as beneath a doorframe or under a table, to take cover. If you happen to be on a street, head to an open space such as a square or park. It is important to remain calm and to not be influenced by people who panic. Rescue Tasks Once the earthquake ends, rescue tasks must begin. At this stage it is imperative to determine whether anyone is injured and to apply first aid. Do not move injured people who have fractures, and do not drink water from open containers. Seek protection under a table or desk to avoid being hurt by falling objects.

Built in the second half of the 19th century, it represented a time of accelerated growth, powered by the gold riches of the state of California. Construction began on Feb. 22, 1870, and ended 27 years later, after many revisions to architect Auguste Laver's original project. While it stood, City Hall was said to have been constructed with bricks held together with corruption, typical of a time of easy money and weak institutions. The total cost of the work rose to a little more than $6,000,000 of that time, and, according to current calculations, it is estimated that it was prepared to withstand an earthquake up to a magnitude of 6.6. Only the dome and the metal structure were left standing. The remnants of the building were demolished in 1909. History of City Hall T he earthquake that shook San Francisco on April 18, 1906, was a major event: in only a few seconds, a large part of one of the most vital cities of the United States was reduced to rubble. Suddenly, centuries of pent-up energy was released when the earthquake, measuring 8.3 on the Richter scale, devastated the city. Though the earthquake destroyed many buildings, the worst damage was caused by the fires that destroyed the city in the course of three days, forcing people to flee their homes. San Francisco in Flames 3 THE GREAT FIRE Two days later, what had begun as a localized fire had become an inferno that consumed the city. There were mass evacuations of people to distant areas, while the army dynamited some buildings. Firefighters had to control the flames using seawater. April 20 4 REBUILDING The city reemerged from the ashes, powered by its wealth and economic importance. Losses are estimated to have reached $5,000,000,000 in present-day dollars, and, until Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005, the 1906 earthquake was the greatest natural disaster the United States had experienced. 3 years 2 5:12 a.m. April 18 THE FACE OF THE BUILDING COLLAPSED. The facade collapsed completely on top of the rotunda at its base. CITY HALL The facade was crowned by a dome that was supported by a system of columns on a steel structure. It was considered one of the city's most beautiful buildings.

EVERYTHING STARTED LIKE THIS. On April 18, 1906, at 5:12 a.m., the Pacific Plate experienced movement of approximately 19 feet (6 m) along its 267- mile (430-km) length along the northern San Andreas fault. The earthquake's epicenter lay 39 miles (64 km) north of San Francisco. In seconds, the earth began to move, and the majority of the city's buildings collapsed. The trolleys and carriages that were moving through the cobblestoned streets of the city were reduced to rubble. THE EARTHQUAKE Not only was the earthquake extremely violent, but it oscillated in every direction for 40 seconds. People left their houses and ran down the streets, completely stunned and blinded by fear. Many buildings split open, and others became piles of rubble. A post office employee related that “The walls were thrown into the middle of the rooms, destroying the furniture and covering everything with dust.”"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 89 The great fire that followed the earthquake expanded quickly. Firefighters, in a desperate attempt to block the spread of the fire, used explosives to make firebreaks because there was no water supply available. The army evacuated the area, and people could not take anything with them. During the three days when the city burned, it is speculated that many homeowners burned their houses that had been partially destroyed by the earthquake, in order to be able to collect insurance money. Other things that contributed to the fire were the intentional explosions that, at first badly implemented, spread the fire. By the fourth day, the center of the city was reduced to ashes. Three Days of Fire It is calculated that some 3,000 people died in the 1906 catastrophe, trapped in their destroyed homes or burned by the fire the earthquake started. In the following weeks, the army, firefighters, and other workers deposited the rubble in the bay, forming new land, which is today known as the Marina District. Little by little, traffic resumed in the major streets, and the trolley system was reestablished. Six weeks after the earthquake, banks and stores opened for business. Clearing the Rubble 88 STUDY AND PREVENTION WORKERS By Saturday, April 21, some 300 plumbers had entered the city to reestablish services, mainly the water system. During the following weeks, thousands of workers tore down unstable buildings, prepared the streets for traffic, and cleared the city of rubble. Nearly 15,000 horses were used to haul rubble. SHORTLY AFTERWARD This panoramic photograph shows the destruction of the city. Despite the destruction, many buildings were left standing. 1 The fire began in the Market Street area, south of the city in the worker's district, where many houses were made of wood. 2 On the second day, the fire spread west. About 300,000 people were evacuated from the bay in ferries. 3 During the third day, the fire swept through Chinatown and North Beach, causing heavy damage to the Victorian homes on North Beach hill. 4 Once the fire was extinguished, Russian Hill and Telegraph Hill (shown as white spots) were still intact, as was the port. Army tents to house refugees. Workers pose while they demolish a house. The firefighters tried to extinguish the fire. 18,000 BUILDINGS OF THAT PERIOD are still standing, despite the 1906 earthquake and the tremors that passed through the city afterward. 28,000 BUILDINGS DEMOLISHED The damage calculated to have been caused by the great earthquake. Many of these buildings, such as City Hall, were famous for their lavish architecture. Day 3 Day 2 Day 2 Day 1 FIELD LUNCH The army set up kitchens in the camps. There was always food in these field kitchens, and there was even a free ration of tobacco for every person. REFUGEE CAMPS The army set up field camps in the parks to house those who had lost everything. Months later, the government built temporary homes for about 20,000 people. CHINATOWN Was completely destroyed by the fire. MILLS BUILDING This building in the financial district had been built in 1890. MERCHANT EXCHANGE Built in 1903, it remained standing and was later refurbished.

The quake was the result of the rupture of more than 40 miles of the San Andreas fault. It is the greatest earthquake in the history of the United States: 300,000 people were left homeless, and property losses reached millions in 1906 dollars. Buildings collapsed, the fires spread for three days, and the water lines were destroyed. 1906 Magnitude Fatalities Material losses 6.8 (Richter) 6,433 $100 billion SUMATRA, INDONESIA Magnitude Fatalities Material losses 9.0 (Richter) 230,507 incalculable An earthquake whose epicenter crossed the island of Sumatra, Indonesia, took place on December 26. This earthquake generated a tsunami that affected the entire Indian Ocean, primarily the islands of Sumatra and Sri Lanka, and reached the coasts of India, Thailand, the Maldives, and even Kenya and Somalia. This was a true human tragedy, and the economic damages were incalculable. 2004 VALDIVIA, CHILE Magnitude Fatalities Material losses 9.5 (Richter) 5,700 $500 million Known as the Great Chilean Earthquake, this was the strongest earthquake of the 20th century. The surface waves produced were so strong that they were still being registered by seismometers 60 hours after the earthquake. The earthquake was felt in various parts of the planet, and a huge tsunami spread through the Pacific Ocean, killing more than 60 people in Hawaii. One of the most powerful earthquakes in memory, its aftershocks lasted for more than a week. More than 5,000 people died, and nearly two million people suffered damage and loss. 1960 KOBE, JAPAN 1995 MEXICO CITY, MEXICO Magnitude Fatalities Material losses 8.1 (Richter) 11,000 $1 billion The city shook on September 19. Two days later, there was an aftershock measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale. In addition to 11,000 deaths, there were 30,000 injured, and 95,000 people were left homeless. As the Cocos Plate slid under the North American Plate, the North American Plate fractured, or split, 12 miles (20 km) inside the mantle. The vibrations of the ocean floor off the southwestern coast of Mexico provoked a tsunami and produced energy 1,000 times as great as that of an atomic bomb. Strong seismic waves reached as far east as Mexico City, a distance of 220 miles (350 km). 1985 KASHMIR, PAKISTAN LISBON, PORTUGAL Magnitude Fatalities Material losses Magnitude Fatalities Material losses 7.6 (Richter) 80,000 $595 million 8.7 (Richter) 62,000 unknown Also known as the Indian Subcontinent Earthquake, the North Pakistan Earthquake, and the South Asian Earthquake. It occurred on Oct. 8, 2005, in the Kashmir region between India and Pakistan. Because schools were in session when the earthquake struck (9:20 a.m.), many of the victims were children, who died when their school buildings collapsed. It was the strongest earthquake experienced by the region for a century. Three million people lost their homes. The most-heavily affected areas lost all their cattle. Entire fields disappeared under earth and rock. The epicenter was located near Islamabad, in the mountains of Kashmir, in an area governed by Pakistan. It was the Day of the Dead, and, at 9:20 in the morning, almost the entire population of Lisbon was at church. While mass was celebrated, the earth quaked, and this earthquake would be one of the most destructive and lethal in history. The earthquake unleashed a tsunami that was felt from Norway to North America and that took the lives of those who had sought shelter in the river. 2005 1755 T he Earth is alive. It moves, it shifts, it crashes and quakes, and it has done so since its origin. Earthquakes vary from a soft vibration to violent and terrorizing movements. Many earthquakes have gone down in history as the worst natural catastrophes ever survived by humanity. Lisbon, Portugal, 1755; Valdivia, Chile, 1960; and Kashmir, Pakistan, 2005, are only three examples of the physical, material, and emotional devastation in which an earthquake can leave a population. AN INFERNO The great earthquake of Hanshin that occurred on Jan. 17, 1995, in Kobe, a Japanese port, left behind more than 6,000 dead, 38,000 injured, and 319,000 people who had to be housed in more than 1,200 emergency shelters. The Nagata District was one of the hardest-hit areas. Almost 80 percent of the victims died because the old wooden homes crumbled in the generalized fires that followed the earthquake. AFTER THE HORROR. The world was shaken, looking at the horrendous images of how Kobe, the city by the sea, had been painfully broken to pieces."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"92 GLOSSARY VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 93 Glossary Aa Type of lava flow that presents sharp projections on its surface when it hardens. Abrasion Modification of rock surfaces by friction and by the impact of other particles transported by wind, water, and ice. Active Volcano Volcano that erupts lava and gas at regular intervals. Aerosol Small particles and drops of liquid scattered in the air by volcanic gases. Aftershock Small temblor or quake produced as rock settles into place after a major earthquake. Aseismic The characteristic of a building designed to withstand oscillations, or of areas with no seismic activity. Aseismic Region Tectonically stable region of the Earth, where there are almost no earthquakes. For example, the Arctic region is aseismic. Ashfall Phenomenon in which gravity causes ash (or other pyroclastic material) to fall from a smoke column after an eruption. The distribution of the ash is a function of wind direction. Asthenosphere Internal layer of the Earth that forms part of the mantle. Avalanche Rapid movement of enormous volumes of rock and other materials caused by instability on the flanks of the volcano. The instability can be caused by the intrusion of magma into the structure of the volcano, by a large earthquake, or by the weakening of the volcano's structure by hydrothermal variation, for example. Ballistic (Fragment) A lump of rock expelled forcefully by a volcanic eruption and that follows a ballistic or elliptical trajectory. Baltic Of or pertaining to the Baltic Sea, or to the territories along it. Batholith Massive body of magma that results from an intrusion between preexisting layers.

Liquefaction Transformation of ground from solid to fluid state through the action of an earthquake. Lithosphere Rigid part of the outer layer of the Earth, formed by the crust and the outer layer of the mantle. This is the layer that is destroyed in subduction zones and that grows in mid-ocean ridges. Magma Mass of molten rock deep below the surface, which includes dissolved gas and crystals. When magma has lost its gases and reaches the surface, it is called lava. If magma cools within the Earth's crust, it forms plutonic rocks. Magma Chamber Section within a volcano where incandescent magma is found. Mantle Layer between the Earth's crust and the outer core. Its lower part, the asthenosphere, is partially molten. The more superficial and less-fluid outer part is called the lithosphere. Mid-Ocean Ridge An elongated mountain range on the ocean floor, which varies between 300 and 3,000 miles (500 and 5,000 km) in breadth. Neck Column of lava that has solidified inside a volcano. Crater Depression on the peak of a volcano, or produced by the impact of a meteorite. Crust Outermost, rigid part of the Earth, made up mostly of basaltic rocks (underneath the oceans) and of rocks with a higher silicate content (in the continents).

Ocean Trench Long, narrow, extremely deep area of the ocean floor formed where the edge of an oceanic tectonic plate sinks beneath another plate. Pahoehoe Lava Lava with a smooth surface that has a ropelike form. Pelean Eruption Type of volcanic eruption with a growing dome of viscous lava that may be destroyed when it collapses because of gravity or brief explosions. Pelean eruptions produce pyroclastic flows or burning clouds. The term comes from Mount Pelée in Martinique. Permeable Layers Strata of the Earth's crust that allow water to reach deeper layers. Plate Tectonics Theory that the Earth's outer layer consists of separate plates that interact in various ways, causing earthquakes and forming volcanoes, mountains, and the crust itself. Plinian Eruption Extremely violent and explosive type of volcanic eruption that continuously expels large quantities of ash and other pyroclastic materials into the atmosphere, forming an eruption column typically 5 to 25 miles (8 to 40 km) high. The term honors Pliny the Younger, who observed the eruption of Mount Vesuvius (Italy) in AD 79. Plume Column of hot rock that rises from within the mantle, inside of which the rock may melt. Primary (P) Wave Seismic wave that alternately compresses and stretches the ground along its direction of travel. Pumice Pale volcanic rock full of holes, which give it a low density. Its composition is usually acidic (rhyolitic). The holes are formed by volcanic gases that expand as volcanic material rises to the surface. Pyroclastic Flow Dense, hot mix of volcanic gas, ash, and rock fragments that flows rapidly down the sides of a volcano. Reverse Fault Fractures in rock layers where the ground is being compressed, which generally causes the upper edge to rise above the lower part in a plane inclined between 45 and 90 degrees from the horizontal. Richter Scale Measures the magnitude of an earthquake or of the energy it releases. The scale is logarithmic, such that an earthquake of magnitude 8 releases 10 times as much energy as a magnitude 7 quake. An earthquake's magnitude is estimated based on measurements taken by seismic instruments. Rift Zone Area where the crust is splitting and stretching, as shown by cracks in the rock. Such areas are produced by the separation of tectonic plates, and their presence causes earthquakes and recurrent volcanic activity. Scale of Intensity Scale used to measure the severity of movement of the ground produced by an earthquake. Degrees of intensity are assigned subjectively depending on how the tremor is perceived and according to the damage caused to buildings. A widely used scale is the Mercalli scale. Secondary (S) Wave Transverse or cross-section wave with motion perpendicular to the direction of its travel. Seismic Event Shaking of the ground caused by an abrupt and violent movement of a mass of rock along a fault, or fracture, in the crust. Active volcanoes cause a wide variety of seismic events. Seismic Gap Fault zone, or zone of a segment at the boundary between tectonic plates, with a known seismic history and activity, which records a period of prolonged calm, or of seismic inactivity, during which large amounts of elastic energy of deformation accumulate, and that, therefore, presents a greater probability of rupture and occurrence of a seismic event. Seismic Hazard Calculation Process of determining the seismic risk of various sites in order to define areas with similar levels of risk. Seismic Risk The probability that the economic and social effects of a seismic event will exceed certain preestablished values during a given period, for example, a certain number of victims, an amount of building damage, economic losses, etc. Also defined as the comparative seismic hazard of one site relative to another. Seismic Wave Wavelike movement that travels through the Earth as a result of an earthquake or an explosion. Seismic Zone Limited geographic area within a seismic region, with similar seismic hazard, seismic risk, and earthquake-resistant design standards. Seismograph Instrument that registers seismic waves or tremors in the Earth's surface during an earthquake. Seismology Branch of geology that studies tremors in the Earth, be they natural or artificial. Shield Volcano Large volcano with gently sloping flanks formed by fluid basaltic lava. Silicon One of the most common materials, and a component of many minerals. Subduction Process by which the oceanic lithosphere sinks into the mantle along a convergence boundary. The Nazca Plate is undergoing subduction beneath the South American Plate. Subduction Zone Long, narrow region where one plate of the crust is slipping beneath another. Surface Wave Seismic wave that travels along the Earth's surface. It is perceived after the primary and secondary waves. Swarm of Earthquakes Sequence of small earthquakes that occur in the same area within a short time period, with a low magnitude in comparison to other earthquakes. Symmetry Correspondence that exists in an object with respect to a center, an axis, or a plane that divides it into parts of equal proportions. Tectonic Plates Large, rigid sections of the Earth's outer layer. These plates sit on top of a more ductile and plastic layer of the mantle, the asthenosphere, and they drift slowly at an average rate of 1 inch (2.4 cm) or more per year. Thrust Fault A fracture in rock layers that is characterized by one boundary that slips above another at an angle of less than 45 degrees. Transform Fault Fault in which plate boundaries cause friction by sliding past each other in opposite directions. Tremor Seismic event perceived on the Earth's surface as a vibration or shaking of the ground, without causing damage or destruction. Tsunami Word of Japanese origin that denotes a large ocean wave caused by an earthquake. Viscous Measure of a material's resistance to flow in response to a force acting on it. The higher the silicon content, the higher the viscosity. Volcanic Glass Natural glass formed when molten lava cools rapidly without crystallizing. A solid-like substance made of atoms with no regular structure. Volcanic Ring Chain of mountains or islands located near the edges of the tectonic plates and that is formed as a result of magma activity associated with subduction zones. Volcano Mountain formed by lava, pyroclastic materials, or both. Volcanology (Vulcanology) Branch of geology that studies the form and activity of volcanoes. Vulcanian Eruption Type of volcanic eruption characterized by the occurrence of explosive events of brief duration that expel material into the atmosphere to heights of about 49,000 feet (15 km). This type of activity is usually linked to the interaction of groundwater and magma (phreatomagmatic eruption). Water Spring Natural source of water that flows out of the crust. The water comes from rainwater that seeps into the ground in one place and comes to the surface in another, usually at a lower elevation. Because the water is not confined in waterproof chambers, it can be heated by contact with igneous rock. This causes it to rise to the surface as hot springs."},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"96 INDEX VOLCANOES AND EARTHQUAKES 97 Index A aa lava flow , 30 abyssal plain , 16 Africa, 15, 16, 72 African

From the most remote of times, people have been curious about what lies hidden beyond the celestial sphere. This curiosity has led them to build telescopes that show with clarity otherwise blurry and distant objects. In this book you will find the history of the cosmos illustrated with spectacular images that show in detail how the cosmos was formed, the nature of the many points of light that adorn the night sky, and what lies ahead. You will also discover how the suns that inhabit space live and die, what dark matter and black holes are, and what our place is in this vastness. Certainly, the opportunity to compare the destiny of other worlds similar to ours will help us understand that for the time being there is no better place than the Earth to live. At least for now. I n the Milky Way—according to mathematical and physical calculations—there are more than 100 billion stars, and such a multitude leads to the question: Is it possible that our Sun is the only star that possesses an inhabited planet? Astronomers are more convinced than ever of the possibility of life in other worlds. We just need to find them. Reading this book will let you become better acquainted with our neighbors in the solar system—the other planets—and the most important characteristics that distinguish them. All this information that explores the mysteries of space is accompanied by recent images captured by the newest telescopes. They reveal many details about the planets and their satellites, such as the volcanoes and craters found on the surface of some of them. You will also learn more about the asteroids and comets that orbit the Sun and about Pluto, a dwarf planet, which is to be visited by a space probe for the first time. Less than a decade ago, astronomers began observing frozen worlds, much smaller than a planet, in a region of the solar system called the Kuiper belt. We invite you to explore all of this. The images and illustrations that accompany the text will prove very helpful in studying and understanding the structure of all the visible and invisible objects (such as dark matter) that form part of the universe. There are stellar maps showing the constellations, the groups of stars that since ancient times have served as a guide for navigation and for the development of calendars. There is also a review through history: from Ptolemy, who thought the planets orbited around the Earth, and Copernicus, who put the Sun in the center, and Galileo, the first to aim a telescope skyward, up to the most recent astronomical theories, such as those of Stephen Hawking, the genius of space and time who continues to amaze with his discoveries about the greatest mysteries of the cosmos. You will find these and many more topics no matter where you look in this fantastic book that puts the universe and its secrets in your hands.

T he universe, marvelous in its majesty, is an ensemble of a hundred billion galaxies. Each of these galaxies (which tend to be found in large groups) has billions of stars. These galactic concentrations surround empty spaces, called cosmic voids. The immensity of the cosmos can be better grasped by realizing that the size of our fragile planet Earth, or even that of the Milky Way, is insignificant compared to the size of the remainder of the cosmos. Originating nearly 14 billion years ago in an immense explosion, the universe today is too large to be able to conceive. The innumerable stars and galaxies that populate it promise to continue expanding for a long time. Though it might sound strange today, for many years, astronomers thought that the Milky Way, where the Earth is located, constituted the entire universe. Only recently—in the 20th century—was outer space recognized as not only much vaster than previously thought but also as being in a state of ongoing expansion. The Universe NEAR STARS Found closer than 20 light-years from the Sun, they make up our solar neighborhood. 2.

Region 1 Region 3 Region 2 Region 4 Region 5 Galaxy 1 Galaxy 2 Galaxy 5 Galaxy 4 Galaxy 3 The Instant of Creation I t is impossible to know precisely how, out of nothing, the universe began to exist. According to the big bang theory—the theory most widely accepted in the scientific community—in the beginning, there appeared an infinitely small and dense burning ball that gave rise to space, matter, and energy. This happened 13.7 billion years ago. The great, unanswered question is what caused a small dot of light—filled with concentrated energy from which matter and antimatter were created—to arise from nothingness. In very little time, the young universe began to expand and cool. Several billion years later, it acquired the form we know today. 10 -43 sec 10 -12 sec 3 min Scientists theorize that, from nothing, something infinitely small, dense, and hot appeared. All that exists today was compressed into a ball smaller than the nucleus of an atom. TIME TEMPERATURE Cosmic Inflation Theory Although big bang theorists understood the universe as originating in an extremely small, hot, and condensed ball, they could not understand the reason for its staggering growth. In 1981, physicist Alan Guth proposed a solution to the problem with his inflationary theory. In an extremely short period of time (less than a thousandth of a second), the universe grew more than a trillion trillion trillion times. Near the end of this period of expansion, the temperature approached absolute zero. HOW IT DID NOT GROW Had the universe not undergone inflation, it would be a collection of different regions, each with its own particular types of galaxies and each clearly distinguishable from the others. HOW IT GREW Cosmic inflation was an expansion of the entire universe. The Earth's galactic neighborhood appears fairly uniform. Everywhere you look, the types of galaxies and the background temperature are essentially the same. FROM PARTICLES TO MATTER The quarks, among the oldest particles, interact with each other by forces transmitted through gluons. Later protons and neutrons will join to form nuclei.

Before the universe's inflation, a superforce governed everything. 2 The universe is unstable. Only 10 -38 seconds after the big bang, the universe increases in size more than a trillion trillion trillion times. The expansion of the universe and the division of its forces begin. 3 The universe experiences a gigantic cooldown. Gravity has already become distinguishable, and the electromagnetic force and the strong and weak nuclear interactions appear. 4 5 sec 9x10 9 ° F (5x10 9 ° C) The electrons and their antiparticles, positrons, annihilate each other until the positrons disappear. The remaining electrons form atoms. 6 10 -4 sec 10 12 ° F (and C) Protons and neutrons appear, formed by three quarks apiece. Because all light is trapped within the web of particles, the universe is still dark. 5 The nuclei of the lightest elements, hydrogen and helium, form. Protons and neutrons unite to form the nuclei of atoms. 7 WMAP (WILKINSON MICROWAVE ANISOTROPY PROBE) NASA's WMAP project maps the background radiation of the universe. In the image, hotter (red-yellow) regions and colder (blue-green) regions can be observed. WMAP makes it possible to determine the amount of dark matter. THE SEPARATION OF FORCES Before the universe expanded, during a period of radiation, only one unified force governed all physical interactions. The first distinguishable force was gravity, followed by electromagnetism and nuclear interactions. Upon the division of the universe's forces, matter was created. Energetic Radiation The burning ball that gave rise to the universe remained a source of permanent radiation. Subatomic particles and antiparticles annihilated each other. The ball's high density spontaneously produced matter and destroyed it. Had this state of affairs continued, the universe would never have undergone the growth that scientists believe followed cosmic inflation. 1 sec 1 A gluon interacts with a quark. 2 Quarks join by means of gluons to form protons and neutrons. 3 Protons and neutrons unite to create nuclei. Electron Negatively charged elemental particle ELEMENTARY PARTICLES In its beginnings, the universe was a soup of particles that interacted with each other because of high levels of radiation. Later, as the universe expanded, quarks formed the nuclei of the elements and then joined with electrons to form atoms. The neutrinos separate from the initial particle soup through the disintegration of neutrons. Though having extremely little mass, the neutrinos might nevertheless form the greatest part of the universe's dark matter.

Electrons orbit the nuclei, attracted by the protons. The universe becomes transparent. Photons travel through space. 8 Galaxies acquire their definitive shape: islands of millions and millions of stars and masses of gases and dust. The stars explode as supernovas and disperse heavier elements, such as carbon. 9 FIRST ATOMS Hydrogen and helium were the first elements to be formed at the atomic level. They are the main components of stars and planets. They are by far the most abundant elements in the universe. The vast span of time related to the history of the universe can be readily understood if it is scaled to correspond to a single year—a year that spans the beginning of the universe, the appearance of humans on the Earth, and the voyage of Columbus to America. On January 1 of this imaginary year—at midnight—the big bang takes place. Homo sapiens appears at 11:56 P.M. on December 31, and Columbus sets sail on the last second of the last day of the year. One second on this timescale is equivalent to 500 true years. 1 Hydrogen An electron is attracted by and orbits the nucleus, which has a proton and a neutron.

THE SOLAR SYSTEM is created on August 24 of this timescale. BIG BANG occurs on the first second of the first day of the year. JANUARY DECEMBER 13.7 billion -454° F (-270° C) The universe continues to expand. Countless galaxies are surrounded by dark matter, which represents 22 percent of the mass and energy in the universe. The ordinary matter, of which stars and planets are made, represents just 4 percent of the total. The predominant form of energy is also of an unknown type. Called dark energy, it constitutes 74 percent of the total mass and energy. 11 DARK MATTER The visible objects in the cosmos represent only a small fraction of the total matter within the universe. Most of it is invisible even to the most powerful telescopes. Galaxies and their stars move as they do because of the gravitational forces exerted by this material, which astronomers call dark matter. THE UNIVERSE TODAY TIMESCALE The Transparent Universe With the creation of atoms and overall cooling, the once opaque and dense universe became transparent. Electrons were attracted by the protons of hydrogen and helium nuclei, and together they formed atoms. Photons (massless particles of light) could now pass freely through the universe. With the cooling, radiation remained abundant but was no longer the sole governing factor of the universe. Matter, through gravitational force, could now direct its own destiny. The gaseous lumps that were present in this process grew larger and larger. After 100 million years, they formed even larger objects. Their shapes not yet defined, they constituted protogalaxies. Gravitation gave shape to the first galaxies some 500 million years after the big bang, and the first stars began to shine in the densest regions of these galaxies. One mystery that could not be solved was why galaxies were distributed and shaped the way they were. The solution that astronomers have been able to find through indirect evidence is that there exists material called dark matter whose presence would have played a role in galaxy formation. 9.1 billion THE EARTH IS CREATED Like the rest of the planets, the Earth is made of material that remained after the formation of the solar system. The Earth is the only planet known to have life. EVOLUTION OF MATTER What can be observed in the universe today is a great quantity of matter grouped into galaxies. But that was not the original form of the universe. What the big bang initially produced was a cloud of uniformly dispersed gas. Just three million years later, the gas began to organize itself into filaments. Today the universe can be seen as a network of galactic filaments with enormous voids between them. 1 Gaseous cloud The first gases and dust resulting from the Big Bang form a cloud. 2 First filaments Because of the gravitational pull of dark matter, the gases joined in the form of filaments. 3 Filament networks The universe has large-scale filaments that contain millions and millions of galaxies. 9 billion -432° F (-258° C) Nine billion years after the big bang, the solar system emerged. A mass of gas and dust collapsed until it gave rise to the Sun. Later the planetary system was formed from the leftover material. 10"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"UNIVERSE 15 14 WHAT IS THE UNIVERSE? Everything Comes to an End T he big bang theory helped solve the enigma of the early moments of the universe. What has yet to be resolved is the mystery surrounding the future that awaits. To unravel this mystery, the total mass of the universe must be known, but that figure has not yet been reliably determined. The most recent observations have removed some of this uncertainty. It seems that the mass of the universe is far too little to stop its expansion. If this is this case, the universe's present growth is merely the last step before its total death in complete darkness. Black hole Universe 1 Universe 1 Universe 4 Universe 3 Black hole Universe 2 Object in three dimensions Object that changes with time Universe 3 New universe Inflection point DISCOVERIES The key discovery that led to the big bang theory was made in the early 1920s by Edwin Hubble, who discovered that galaxies were moving away from each other. In the 1940s, George Gamow developed the idea that the universe began with a primordial explosion. A consequence of such an event would be the existence of background radiation, which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson accidentally detected in the mid-1960s. There is a critical amount of mass for which the universe would expand at a declining rate without ever totally stopping. The result of this eternal expansion would be the existence of an ever-increasing number of galaxies and stars. If the universe were flat, we could talk about a cosmos born from an explosion, but it would be a universe continuing outward forever. It is difficult to think about a universe with these characteristics. Flat Universe BIG BANG BIG CRUNCH HOW IT IS MADE UP Dark energy is hypothesized to be the predominant energy in the universe. It is believed to speed up the expansion of the universe. BLACK HOLES Some theorists believe that, by entering a black hole, travel through space to other universes might be possible because of antigravitational effects. 1 The universe expands violently. 2 The universe's growth slows. 3 The universe collapses upon itself, forming a dense, hot spot. 1 The universe continuously expands and evolves. TIME 2 The universe's expansion is unceasing but ever slower. 2 Expansion is continuous and pronounced. 3 Gravity is not sufficient to bring a complete stop to the universe's expansion. 4 The universe expands indefinitely. 1 Self-generated Universes A less widely accepted theory about the nature of the universe suggests that universes generate themselves. If this is the case, universes would be created continuously like the branches of a tree, and they might be linked by supermassive black holes. According to this theory, universes continuously sprout other universes. But in this case, one universe would be created from the death or disappearance of another. Each dead universe in a final collapse, or Big Crunch, would give rise to a supermassive black hole, from which another universe would be born. This process could repeat itself indefinitely, making the number of universes impossible to determine. Baby Universes 5 Closed Universe If the universe had more than critical mass, it would expand until reaching a point where gravity stopped the expansion. Then, the universe would contract in the Big Crunch, a total collapse culminating in an infinitely small, dense, and hot spot similar to the one from which the universe was formed. Gravity's pull on the universe's excess matter would stop the expansion and reverse the process. 2 Open Universe The most accepted theory about the future of the cosmos says that the universe possesses a mass smaller than the critical value. The latest measurements seem to indicate that the present time is just a phase before the death of the universe, in which it goes completely dark. 4 1 After the original expansion, the universe grows. 3 reaches a point where everything grows dark and life is extinguished. 3 74 % dark energy 22% dark matter 4% visible matter GALACTIC EXPANSION By noting a redshift toward the red end of the spectrum, Hubble was able to demonstrate that galaxies were moving away from each other. 1920s GAMOW'S SUSPICION Gamow first hypothesized the big bang, holding that the early universe was a “cauldron” of particles. 1940s BACKGROUND RADIATION Penzias and Wilson detected radio signals that came from across the entire sky—the uniform signal of background radiation. 1965 THE HAWKING UNIVERSE The universe was composed originally of four spatial dimensions without the dimension of time. Since there is no change without time, one of these dimensions, according to Hawking, transformed spontaneously on a small scale into a temporal dimension, and the universe began to expand."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"UNIVERSE 17 16 WHAT IS THE UNIVERSE? The Forces of the Universe T he four fundamental forces of nature are those that are not derived from basic forces. Physicists believe that, at one time, all physical forces functioned as a single force and that during the expansion of the universe, they became distinct from each other. Each force now governs different processes, and each interaction affects different types of particles. Gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear interactions, and weak nuclear interactions are essential to our understanding of the behavior of the many objects that exist in the universe. In recent years, many scientists have tried with little success to show how all forces are manifestations of a single type of exchange. The universe, if it were empty, could be pictured in this way. The universe is deformed by the mass of the objects it contains. MOLECULAR MAGNETISM In atoms and molecules, the electromagnetic force is dominant. It is the force that causes the attraction between protons and electrons in an atom and the attraction or repulsion between ionized atoms. NEWTON'S EQUATION BENDING LIGHT Light also bends because of the curvature of space-time. When seen from a telescope, the real position of an object is distorted. What is perceived through the telescope is a false location, generated by the curvature of the light. It is not possible to see the actual position of the object. The biggest contribution to our comprehension of the universe's internal workings was made by Albert Einstein in 1915. Building on Newton's theory of universal gravitation, Einstein thought of space as linked to time. To Newton, gravity was merely the force that attracted two objects, but Einstein hypothesized that it was a consequence of what he called the curvature of space- time. According to his general theory of relativity, the universe curves in the presence of objects with mass. Gravity, according to this theory, is a distortion of space that determines whether one object rolls toward another. Einstein's general theory of relativity required scientists to consider the universe in terms of a non- Euclidian geometry, since it is not compatible with the idea of a flat universe. In Einsteinian space, two parallel lines can meet. General Theory of Relativity UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION The gravitation proposed by Newton is the mutual attraction between bodies having mass. The equation developed by Newton to calculate this force states that the attraction experienced by two bodies is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Newton represented the constant of proportionality resulting from this interaction as G. The shortcoming of Newton's law, an accepted paradigm until Einstein's theory of general relativity, lies in its failure to make time an essential component in the interaction between objects. According to Newton, the gravitational attraction between two objects with mass did not depend on the properties of space but was an intrinsic property of the objects themselves. Nevertheless, Newton's law of universal gravitation was a foundation for Einstein's theory. The strong nuclear force holds the protons and neutrons of atomic nuclei together. Both protons and neutrons are subject to this force. Gluons are particles that carry the strong nuclear force, and they bind quarks together to form protons and neutrons. Atomic nuclei are held together by residual forces in the interaction between quarks and gluons. Strong Nuclear Force 3 The weak nuclear force is not as strong as the other forces. The weak nuclear interaction influences the beta decay of a neutron, which releases a proton and a neutrino that later transforms into an electron. This force takes part in the natural radioactive phenomena associated with certain types of atoms. Weak Nuclear Force 4 Electromagnetism is the force that affects electrically charged bodies. It is involved in the chemical and physical transformations of the atoms and molecules of the various elements. The electromagnetic force can be one of attraction or repulsion, with two types of charges or poles. Electromagnetism 2 Gravity was the first force to become distinguishable from the original superforce. Today scientists understand gravity in Einstein's terms as an effect of the curvature of space-time.

Today we know that they are gigantic spheres of incandescent gas—mostly hydrogen, with a smaller proportion of helium. As a star radiates light, astronomers can precisely measure its brightness, color, and temperature. Because of their enormous distance from the Earth, stars beyond the Sun only appear as points of light, and even the most powerful telescopes do not reveal any surface features.

Calcium Hydrogen Hydrogen Hydrogen Sodium Wavelength longest on the red side When a star moves toward or away from an observer, its wavelengths of light shift, a phenomenon called the Doppler effect. If the star is approaching the Earth, the dark lines in its spectrum experience a blueshift. If it moves away from the Earth, the lines experience a redshift.

The most massive stars are those with greatest intrinsic luminosity. They include blue stars, red giants, and red supergiants. Stars spend 90 percent of their lives in what is known as the main sequence. Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) Diagram In measuring the great distances between stars, both light-years (ly) and parsecs (pc) are used. A light-year is the distance that light travels in a year— 5.9 trillion miles (10 trillion km). A light- year is a unit of distance, not time. A parsec is equivalent to the distance between the star and the Earth if the parallax angle is of one second arc. A pc is equal to 3.26 light- years, or 19 trillion miles (31 trillion km). Light-years and Parsecs When the Earth orbits the Sun, the closest stars appear to move in front of a background of more distant stars. The angle described by the movement of a star in a six-month period of the Earth's rotation is called its parallax. The parallax of the most distant stars are too small to measure. The closer a star is to the Earth, the greater its parallax. Measuring Distance The electromagnetic waves that make up light have different wavelengths. When light from a hot object, such as a star, is split into its different wavelengths, a band of colors, or spectrum, is obtained. Patterns of dark lines typically appear in the spectrum of a star. These patterns can be studied to determine the elements that make up the star. Spectral Analysis Dark lines deviate toward the blue end of the spectrum. BLUESHIFT of a star moving toward the Earth.

UNIVERSE 23 S tars are born in nebulae, which are giant clouds of gas (mainly hydrogen) and dust that float in space. Stars can have a life span of millions, or even billions, of years. The biggest stars have the shortest lives, because they consume their nuclear fuel (hydrogen) at a very accelerated rate. Other stars, like the Sun, burn fuel at a slower rate and may live some 10 billion years. Many times, a star's size indicates its age. Smaller stars are the youngest, and bigger stars are approaching their end, either through cooling or by exploding as a supernova. Stellar Evolution Nebula Small star Less than 8 solar masses STAR A star is finally born. It fuses hydrogen to form helium and lies along the main sequence. 2. The evolution of a star depends on its mass. The smallest ones, like the Sun, have relatively long and modest lives. Such a star begins to burn helium when its hydrogen is depleted. In this way, its external layers begin to swell until the star turns into a red giant. It ends its life as white dwarfs, eventually fading away completely, ejecting remaining outer layers, and forming a planetary nebula. A massive star, because of its higher density, can form elements heavier than helium from its nuclear reactions. In the final stage of its life, its core collapses and the star explodes.

When the star's helium is depleted, fusion of carbon and oxygen begins, which causes the star's core to contract. The star continues to live, though its surface layers begin to expand and cool as the star turns into a red giant. Stars similar to the Sun (solar-type stars) follow this process. After billions of years, they end up as white dwarfs. When they are fully extinguished, they will be black dwarfs, invisible in space. UNIVERSE 25 24 WHAT IS IN THE UNIVERSE? Red, Danger, and Death DIAMETER All stars go through a red-giant stage. Depending on a star's mass, it may collapse or it may simply die enveloped in gaseous layers. The core of a red giant is 10 times smaller than it was originally since it shrinks from a lack of hydrogen. A supergiant star (one with an initial mass greater than eight solar masses) lives a much shorter life. Because of the high density attained by its core, it eventually collapses in on itself and explodes. Red Giant HERTZSPRUNG-RUSSELL When a white dwarf leaves the red-giant stage, it occupies the lower-left corner of the H-R diagram. Its temperature may be double that of a typical red giant. A massive white dwarf can collapse in on itself and end its life as a neutron star. HYDROGEN Hydrogen continues undergoing nuclear fusion in the exterior of the core even when the inner core has run out of hydrogen. HELIUM Helium is produced by the fusion of hydrogen during the main sequence. CARBON AND OXYGEN Carbon and oxygen are produced by the fusion of helium within the core of the red giant. 1 2 3 SUN Convection Cells Convection cells carry heat toward the surface of a star. The ascending currents of gas eventually reach the surface of the star, carrying with them a few elements that formed in the star's core.

After going through the red-giant stage, a solar-type star loses its outer layers, giving rise to a planetary nebula. In its center remains a white dwarf—a relatively small, very hot (360,000° F [200,000° C]), dense star. After cooling for millions of years, it shuts down completely and becomes a black dwarf. White Dwarf On leaving the main sequence, the star enlarges to 200 times the size of the Sun. When the star begins to burn helium, its size decreases to between 10 and 100 times the size of the Sun. The star then remains stable until it becomes a white dwarf. SPECTACULAR DIMENSIONS HERTZSPRUNG-RUSSELL When the star exhausts its hydrogen, it leaves the main sequence and burns helium as a red giant (or a supergiant). The smallest stars take billions of years to leave the main sequences. The color of a red giant is caused by its relatively cool surface temperature of 3,600° F (2,000° C).

THE FUTURE OF THE SUN Dust Grains Dust grains condense in the star's outer atmosphere and later disperse in the form of stellar winds.

In general, planetary nebulae are symmetrical or spherical objects. Although it has not been possible to determine why they exist in such diversity, the reason may be related to the effects of the magnetic field of the dying central star. Viewed through a telescope, several nebulae can be seen to contain a central dwarf star, a mere remnant of its precursor star.

In other words, each cubic meter of a white dwarf star weighs a million tons. The mass of a star is indirectly proportional to its diameter. A white dwarf with a diameter 100 times smaller than the Sun has a mass 70 times greater. M2-9 The Butterfly Nebula contains a star in addition to a white dwarf.

A white dwarf is very massive in spite of the fact that its diameter of 9,300 miles (or 15,000 km) is comparable to the Earth's. The astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, winner of the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1983, calculated the maximum mass a star could have so that it would not eventually collapse on itself. If a star's mass exceeds this limit, the star will eventually explode in a supernova. CHANDRASEKHAR LIMIT 1.44 SOLAR MASSES is the limit Chandrasekhar obtained.

Supernovae A supernova is an extraordinary explosion of a giant star at the end of its life, accompanied by a sudden increase in brightness and the release of a great amount of energy. In 10 seconds, a supernova releases 100 times more energy than the Sun will release in its entire life. After the explosion of the star that gives rise to a supernova, the gaseous remnant expands and shines for millions of years. It is estimated that, in our Milky Way galaxy, two supernovae occur per century. Supernova GAS AND DUST Gas and dust that have accumulated in the two visible lobes absorb the blue light and ultraviolet rays emitted from its center. FUSION The nuclear reactions in a dying star occur at a faster rate than they do in a red giant. GASEOUS FILAMENTS Gaseous filaments are ejected by the supernova at 620 miles (1,000 km) per second. THE END Either a neutron star or a black hole may form depending on the initial mass of the star that has died. Stellar Remnant When the star explodes as a supernova, it leaves as a legacy in space the heavy elements (such as carbon, oxygen, and iron) that were in the star's nucleus before its collapse. The Crab Nebula (M1) was created by a supernova seen in 1054 by Chinese astronomers. The Crab Nebula is located 6.5 light-years from Earth and has a diameter of six light-years. The star that gave rise to the Crab Nebula may have had an initial mass close to 10 solar masses. In 1969, a pulsar radiating X-rays and rotating 33 times per second was discovered at the center of the nebula, making the Crab Nebula a very powerful source of radiation. The explosion that marks the end of a supergiant's life occurs because the star's extremely heavy core has become incapable of supporting its own gravity any longer. In the absence of fusion in its interior, the star falls in upon itself, expelling its remaining gases, which will expand and shine for hundreds—or even thousands—of years. The explosion of the star injects new material into interstellar space and contributes heavy atoms that can give rise to new generations of stars. The Twilight of a Star Supergiant The diameter of the star may increase to more than 1,000 times that of the Sun. Through nuclear fusion, the star can produce elements even heavier than carbon and oxygen. When a star's iron core increases in density to 1.44 solar masses, the star can no longer support its own weight and it collapses upon itself. The resulting explosion causes the formation of elements that are heavier than iron, such as gold and uranium. Other Elements Core A star's core can be seen to be separated into distinct layers that correspond to the different elements created during nuclear fusion. The last element created before the star's collapse is iron. DENSE CORE CRAB NEBULA Explosion The star's life ends in an immense explosion. During the weeks following the explosion, great quantities of energy are radiated that are sometimes greater than the energy emitted by the star's parent galaxy. A supernova may illuminate its galaxy for weeks. ETA CARINAE SUPERMASSIVE The mass of Eta Carinae is 100 times greater than that of the Sun.

The Final Darkness T he last stage in the evolution of a star's core is its transformation into a very dense, compact stellar body. Its particulars depend upon the amount of mass involved in its collapse. The largest stars become black holes, their density so great that their gravitational forces capture even light. The only way to detect these dead stars is by searching for the effects of their gravitation. Discovery of Black Holes The only way of detecting the presence of a black hole in space is by its effect on neighboring stars. Since the gravitational force exerted by a black hole is so powerful, the gases of nearby stars are absorbed at great speed, spiraling toward the black hole and forming a structure called an accretion disk. The friction of the gases heats them until they shine brightly. The hottest parts of the accretion disk may reach 100,000,000° C and are a source of X-rays. The black hole, by exerting such powerful gravitational force, attracts everything that passes close to it, letting nothing escape. Since even light is not exempt from this phenomenon, black holes are opaque and invisible to even the most advanced telescopes. Some astronomers believe that supermassive black holes might have a mass of millions, or even billions, of solar masses. When a star's initial mass is between 10 and 20 solar masses, its final mass will be larger than the mass of the Sun. Despite losing great quantities of matter during nuclear reactions, the star finishes with a very dense core. Because of its intense magnetic and gravitational fields, a neutron star can end up as a pulsar. A pulsar is a rapidly spinning neutron star that gives off a beam of radio waves or other radiation. As the beam sweeps around the object, the radiation is observed in very regular pulses. tons is what one tablespoon of a neutron star would weigh. Its small diameter causes the star to have a compact, dense core accompanied by intense gravitational effects. 1 billion RED GIANT A red giant leaves the main sequence. Its diameter is 100 times greater than the Sun's. 1 SUPERGIANT A supergiant grows and rapidly fuses heavier chemical elements, forming carbon, oxygen, and finally iron. 2 EXPLOSION The star's iron core collapses. Protons and electrons annihilate each other and form neutrons. 3 DENSE CORE The core's exact composition is presently unknown. Most of its interacting particles are neutrons. 4 Pulsars The first pulsar (a neutron star radiating radio waves) was discovered in 1967. Pulsars rotate approximately 30 times per second and have very intense magnetic fields. Pulsars emit radio waves from their two magnetic poles when they rotate. If a pulsar absorbs gas from a neighboring star, a hot spot that radiates X-rays is produced on the pulsar's surface. Devouring gas from a supergiant Located within a binary system, the pulsar can follow the same process as a black hole. The pulsar's gravitational force causes it to absorb the gas of smaller, neighboring stars, heating up the pulsar's surface and causing it to emit X-rays. CURVED SPACE THE SUN forms a shallow gravitational well. 1 A WHITE DWARF generates a deeper gravitational well, drawing in objects at a higher speed. 2 Accretion Disk An accretion disk is a gaseous accumulation of matter that the black hole draws from nearby stars. In the regions of the disk very close to the black hole, X-rays are emitted. The gas that accumulates rotates at very high speeds. When the gases from other stars collide with the disk, they create bright, hot spots. Bright gases Since the accretion disk is fed by gases spinning at high speed, it shines intensely in the region closest to its core but at its edges is colder and darker. Rotation axis Radio-wave beam Magnetic field Possible solid core Neutron star Strong Gravitational Attraction The gravitational force of the black hole attracts gases from a neighboring star. This gas forms a large spiral that swirls faster and faster as it gets closer to the black hole. The gravitation field that it generates is so strong that it traps objects that pass close to it. LIGHT RAYS BLACK HOLE The objects that approach the black hole too closely are swallowed by it. The black hole's gravitational well is infinite and traps matter and light forever. The event horizon describes the limit of what is, and is not, absorbed. Any object that crosses the event horizon follows a spiral path into the gravitational well. Some scientists believe in the existence of so- called wormholes—antigravity tunnels, through which travel across the universe is hypothesized to be possible. By taking advantage of the curvature of space, scientists think it could be possible to travel from the Earth to the Moon in a matter of seconds. 4 WORMHOLE ENTRANCE EXIT Neutron Star STRUCTURE OF A PULSAR X- RAYS As gases enter the black hole, they are heated and emit X-rays. Total escape Rays of light that pass far from the center of a black hole continue unaffected. A NEUTRON STAR attracts objects at speeds approaching half the speed of light. The gravitational well is even more pronounced. 3 The theory of relativity suggests that gravity is not a force but a distortion of space. This distortion creates a gravitational well, the depth of which depends on the mass of the object. Objects are attracted to other objects through the curvature of space. Close to the limit Since the rays of light have not crossed the event horizon, they still retain their brightness.

In 1926, he pointed out that the spots, or patches, of light visible in the night sky were actually distant galaxies. Hubble's discovery put an end to the view held by astronomers at the time that the Milky Way constituted the universe. In 1929, as a result of various observations of the spectrum of light radiated by the stars in the galaxies, Hubble noted that the light from the galaxies showed a redshift (Doppler effect). This effect indicated that the galaxies were moving away from the Milky Way Galaxy. Hubble concluded that the 32 WHAT IS IN THE UNIVERSE?

Acting in response to gravitational force, they can form clusters of galaxies of anywhere from two to thousands of galaxies. These clusters have various shapes and are thought to expand when they join together. The Hercules cluster, shown here, was discovered by Edmond Halley in 1714 and is located approximately 25,100 light-years from Earth. Each dot represents a galaxy that includes billions of stars. Anatomy of Galaxies COLLISION 300 million light-years from the Earth, these two colliding galaxies form a pair. Together they are called “The Mice” for the large tail of stars emanating from each galaxy. With time, these galaxies will fuse into a single, larger one. It is believed that in the future the universe will consist of a few giant stars. MILKY WAY Seen from its side, the Milky Way looks like a flattened disk, swollen at the center. Around the disk is a spherical region, called a halo, containing dark matter and globular clusters of stars. From June to September, the Milky Way is especially bright, something that would make it more visible viewed from above than from the side. 1.2 BILLION YEARS ago, the Antennae (NGC 4038 and NGC 4039) were two separate spiral galaxies. 1 300 MILLION YEARS later, the galaxies collided at great speed. 2 300 MILLION YEARS go by until the collision takes place and the shapes of the galaxies are distorted. 3 300 MILLION YEARS later, the stars in the spiral arms are expelled from both galaxies. 4 NOW two jets of expelled stars stretch far from the original galaxies. 5 universe is expanding. But the expansion of the universe does not imply that galaxies are growing in numbers. On the contrary, galaxies can collide and merge. When two galaxies collide, they can distort each other in various ways. Over time, there are fewer and fewer galaxies. Some galaxies exhibit very peculiar ELLIPTICAL These galaxies are elliptical in shape and have little dust and gas. Their masses fall within a wide range. SPIRAL In a spiral galaxy, a nucleus of old stars is surrounded by a flat disk of stars and two or more spiral arms. Galaxies are subdivided into different categories according to their tendency toward round shape (in the case of elliptical galaxies), as well as by the presence of an axis and the length of their arms (in the case of spiral and barred spiral galaxies). An E0 galaxy is elliptical but almost circular, and an E7 galaxy is a flattened oval. An Sa galaxy has a large central axis and coiled arms, and an Sc galaxy has a thinner axis and more extended arms. IRREGULAR Irregular galaxies have no defined shape and cannot be classified.

Even though astronomers now know that galaxies are held together by gravitational force, they have not been able to decipher what reasons might be behind galaxies' many shapes. The various types of galaxies range from ovals of old stars to spirals with arms of young stars and bright gases. The center of a galaxy has the greatest accumulation of stars. The Milky Way Galaxy is now known to be so big that rays of light, which travel at 186,000 miles (300,000 km) per second, take 100,000 years to cross from one end to the other."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"1 A small number of galaxies differ from the rest by emitting high amounts of energy. The energy emission might be caused by the presence of black holes in its core that were formed through the gravitational collapse accompanying the death of supermassive stars. During their first billion years, the galaxies might have accumulated surrounding gaseous disks with their corresponding emissions of radiation. It is possible that the cores of the first galaxies are the quasars that are now observed at very great distances. The Force of Gravity Gravitational force begins to unite vast quantities of hot, gaseous clouds. The clouds attract one another and collide, forming stars. A large amount of gas accumulates at the center of the galaxy, intensifying gravitational forces until a massive black hole comes into being in the galaxy's core. 2 The Quasar in the Core The quasar in the core ejects two jets of particles that reach speeds approaching the speed of light. The quasar stage is thought to have been the most violent stage in the formation of galaxies. The gases and stars arising from the jets are introduced as spirals into the black hole, forming a type of accretion disk known as a quasar. 4 Stable Galaxy Nine billion years after its formation, with a supermassive black hole at its core, the galaxy drastically slows its energetic activity, forming a low- energy core. The stabilization of the galaxy allowed the formation of stars and other heavenly bodies. Active Galaxies Astronomers believe that active galaxies are a direct legacy from the beginning of the universe. After the big bang, these galaxies would have retained very energetic levels of radiation. Quasars, the brightest and most ancient objects in the universe, make up the core of this type of galaxy. In some cases, they emit X-rays or radio waves. The existence of this high-energy activity helps support the theory that galaxies could be born from a supermassive black hole with a quasar that became inactive as stars formed and it was left without gas to feed it. This process of formation might be common to many galaxies. Today quasars represent the limit of what it is possible to see, even with specialized telescopes. Quasars are small, dense, and bright. Energetic Activity A theory of galaxy formation associated with active galaxies holds that many galaxies, possibly including the Milky Way, were formed from the gradual calming of a quasar at their core. As the surrounding gases consolidated in the formation of stars, the quasars, having no more gases to absorb, lost their energetic fury and became inactive. According to this theory, there is a natural progression from quasars to active galaxies to the common galaxies of today. In 1994, astronomers studying the center of the Milky Way discovered a region that may contain a black hole and could be left over from early galactic activity. Galaxy Formation GAS As two jets are expelled from the core, radio waves are emitted. If the waves collide with clouds of intergalactic gas, they swell and form gigantic clouds that can emit radio waves or X-rays. CENTRAL RING The core of an active galaxy is obscured by a ring of dust and gas that is dark on the outside and bright within. It is a powerful source of energy. GASEOUS CLOUDS Gaseous clouds appeared from the gravitational collapse of immense masses of gas during the early stages of the universe. Later, in the clouds' interior, stars began to form. 3 Black Hole A black hole swallows the gas that begins to surround it. A hot, gaseous spiral forms, emitting high-speed jets. The magnetic field pours charged particles into the region around the black hole, and the exterior of the disk absorbs interstellar gas. UNIVERSE 35 34 WHAT IS IN THE UNIVERSE? The classification of an active galaxy depends upon its distance from Earth and the perspective from which it is seen. Quasars, radio galaxies, and blazars are members of the same family of objects and differ only in the way they are perceived. CLASSIFICATION QUASARS The most powerful objects in the universe, quasars are so distant from Earth that they appear to us as diffuse stars. They are the bright cores of remote galaxies. RADIO GALAXIES Radio galaxies are the largest objects in the universe. Jets of gases come out from their centers that extend thousands of light-years. The cores of radio galaxies cannot be seen. BLAZARS Blazars may be active galaxies with jets of gas that are aimed directly toward Earth. The brightness of a blazar varies from day to day. PARTICLES ejected from the black hole have intense magnetic fields. The jets of particles travel at speeds approaching the speed of light when they leave the core. Dark clouds of gas and dust on the outer edge of a black hole are gradually swallowed up. ACCRETION DISK Formed by interstellar gas and star remnants, the accretion disk can radiate X-rays because of the extreme temperature of its center. 100 MILLION DEGREES Celsius is the temperature that the core of a black hole can reach. 4 The center of the black hole radiates charged particles. 3 The strong gravitational force of the disk attracts and destroys stars. 2 As the gases move inward, their temperature increases. 1 INCREASING GRAVITY"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"UNIVERSE 37 36 WHAT IS IN THE UNIVERSE? Stellar Metropolis F or a long time, our galaxy (called the Milky Way because of its resemblance to a stream of milk in the night sky) was a true enigma. It was Galileo Galilei who, in 1610, first pointed a telescope at the Milky Way and saw that the weak whitish strip was composed of thousands and thousands of stars that appeared to almost touch each other. Little by little, astronomers began to realize that all these stars, like our own Sun, were part of the enormous ensemble—the galaxy that is our stellar metropolis. GASES SWIRL outward because of forces in the Sagittarius A region. Because the gas rotates at high speed but remains concentrated, it could be trapped by gravitational forces exerted by a black hole. BRIGHT STARS Bright stars are born from gas that is not absorbed by the black hole. Most of them are young. Central Region Because the Milky Way is full of clouds of dust and rock particles, its center cannot be seen from outside the galaxy. The Milky Way's center can be seen only through telescopes that record infrared light, radio waves, or X-rays, which can pass through the material that blocks visible light. The central axis of the Milky Way contains ancient stars, some 14 billion years old, and exhibits intense activity within its interior, where two clouds of hot gas have been found: Sagittarius A and B. In the central region, but outside the core, a giant dark cloud contains 70 different types of molecules. These gas clouds are associated with violent activity in the center of our galaxy and contain the heart of the Milky Way within their depths. In general, the stars in this region are cold and range in color from red to orange. The core of the Milky Way galaxy is marked by very intense radio-wave activity that might be produced by an accretion disk made up of incandescent gas surrounding a massive black hole. The region of Sagittarius A, discovered in 1994, is a gas ring that rotates at very high speed, swirling within several light-years of the center of the galaxy. The speed of its rotation is an indication of the powerful gravitational force exerted from the center of the Milky Way, a force stronger than would be produced by the stars located in the region. The hot, blue stars that shine in the center of the Milky Way may have been born from gas not yet absorbed by the black hole. The Exact Center The brightest portion of the Milky Way that appears in photographs taken with optical lenses (using visible light) is in the constellation Sagittarius, which appears to lie in the direction of the center of the Milky Way. The bright band in the nighttime sky is made up of stars so numerous that it is almost impossible to count them. In some cases, stars are obscured by dense dust clouds that make some regions of the Milky Way seem truly dark. The objects that can be found in the Milky Way are not all of one type. Some, such as those known as the halo population, are old and are distributed within a sphere around the galaxy. Other objects form a more flattened structure called the disk population. In the spiral arm population, we find the youngest objects in the Milky Way. In these arms, gas and interstellar dust abound. A Diverse Galaxy ROTATION The speeds of the rotation of the various parts of the Milky Way vary according to those parts' distances from the core of the galaxy. The greatest number of stars is concentrated in the region between the Milky Way's core and its border. Here the speed of rotation is much greater because of the attraction that the objects in this region feel from the billions of stars within it. THE MILKY WAY IN VISIBLE LIGHT THE CONSTELLATION SAGITTARIUS Close to the center of the Milky Way, Sagittarius shines intensely. SECTORS Many different sectors make up the Milky Way. STARS So many stars compose the Milky Way that it is impossible for us to distinguish them all. DARK REGIONS Dark regions are produced by dense clouds that obscure the light of stars. HOT GASES The hot gases originating from the surface of the central region may be the result of violent explosions in the accretion disk. BLACK HOLE Many astronomers believe that a black hole occupies the center of the Milky Way. Its strong gravitational force would trap gases in orbit around it. MAGNETISM The center of the Milky Way is surrounded by strong magnetic fields, perhaps from a rotating black hole. SAGITTARIUS B2 The largest dark cloud in the central region of the Milky Way, Sagittarius B2 contains enough alcohol to cover the entire Earth. OUTER RING A ring of dark clouds of dust and molecules that is expanding as a result of a giant explosion. It is suspected that a small object in the central region of the Milky Way might be its source. Andromeda Galaxy MILKY WAY The Milky Way, containing more than 100 billion stars, has two spiral arms rotating around its core. The Sagittarius arm, located between the Orion arm and the center of the Milky Way, holds one of the most luminous stars in the galaxy, Eta Carinae. The Perseus arm, the main outer arm of the Milky Way, contains young stars and nebulae. The Orion arm, extending between Perseus and Sagittarius, houses the solar system within its inner border. The Orion arm of the Milky Way is a veritable star factory, where gaseous interstellar material can give birth to billions of stars. Remnants of stars can also be found within it. 100,000 LIGHT-YEARS The diameter of the Milky Way is large in comparison with other galaxies but not gigantic.

To ancient peoples, the Sun was a god; to us, it is the central source of energy that generates heat, helping life exist. This star, together with the planets and other bodies that spin in orbits around it, make up the solar system, which formed about 4.6 billion years ago. The planets that rotate around it do not produce their own light. Instead, they reflect sunlight. After the Earth, Mars is the most explored planet.

They are enormous gas spheres with small solid cores. They have very low temperatures because of their great distance from the Sun. The presence of ring systems is exclusive to these planets. The greatest of them is Jupiter: 1,300 Earths could fit inside of it. Its mass is 2.5 times as great as that of the rest of the planets combined. Inner Planets Planets located inside the asteroid belt. They are solid bodies in which internal geologic phenomena, such as volcanism, which can modify their surfaces, are produced. Almost all of them have an appreciable atmosphere of some degree of thickness, according to individual circumstances, which plays a key role in the surface temperatures of each planet. Asteroid Belt The border between the outer and inner planets is marked by millions of rocky fragments of various sizes that form a band called the asteroid belt. Their orbits are influenced by the gravitational pull exerted on them by the giant planet Jupiter. This effect also keeps them from merging and forming a planet. ORIGIN Remains from the formation of the Sun created a disk of gas and dust around it, from which the planetesimals formed. Early ideas suggested that the planets formed gradually, beginning with the binding of hot dust particles. Today scientists suggest that the planets originated from the collision and melding of larger-sized bodies called planetesimals. 1 COLLISION Through collisions among themselves, planetesimals of different sizes joined together to become more massive objects. 2 HEAT The collisions produced a large amount of heat that accumulated in the interior of the planets, according to their distance from the Sun. 3 BUILDING PLANETS ORBITS NEPTUNE DIAMETER MOONS 30,775 MILES (49,528 KM) 13 URANUS DIAMETER MOONS 31,763 MILES (51,118 KM) 27 SATURN DIAMETER MOONS 74,898 MILES (120,536 KM) 50+ JUPITER DIAMETER MOONS 88,846 MILES (142,984 KM) 60+ SUN EARTH DIAMETER MOONS 7,926 MILES (12,756 KM) 1 VENUS DIAMETER MOONS 7,520 MILES (12,103 KM) 0 Venus's orbit Jupiter's orbit Saturn's orbit Uranus's orbit Neptune's orbit Earth's orbit Mercury's orbit Mars's orbit Main belt In general, the planets orbit in one common plane called the elliptic.

In the 17th century, astronomer Johannes Kepler proposed a model to interpret the dynamic properties of the bodies of the solar system. According to this interpretation, the planets complete elliptical trajectories, called orbits, around the Sun. In every case, the movement is produced by the influence of the gravitational field of the Sun. Today, as part of a rapidly developing field of astronomy, it is known that planet or planetlike bodies also orbit other stars.

For that reason, they appear dark. MACROSPICULES This type of vertical eruption is similar to a spicule, but it usually reaches up to 25,000 miles (40,000 km) in height. CORE The core occupies only 2 percent of the total volume of the Sun, but in it is concentrated about half the total mass of the Sun. The great pressures and temperatures in the core produce thermonuclear fusion. 27,000,000º F (15,000,000º C) Very Gassy The Sun is a giant ball of gases with very high density and temperature. Its main components are hydrogen (90%) and helium (9%). The balance of its mass is made up of trace elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, among others. Because of the conditions of extreme temperature and pressure on the Sun, these elements are in a plasma state. Surface and Atmosphere The visible portion of the Sun is a sphere of light, or photosphere, made of boiling gases emanating from the solar core. The gas flares form plasma, which passes through this layer. Later the gas flares enter a vast gas layer called the solar atmosphere. The density of this layer decreases toward its outermost region. Above the photosphere lies the solar atmosphere—the chromosphere and the corona. The energy generated at the core moves through the surface of the photosphere and solar atmosphere for thousands of years in search of an exit into space.

PHOTOSPHERE The visible surface of the Sun, a boiling tide, is thick with gases in a plasma state. In its uppermost layer, its density decreases and its transparency increases, and the solar radiation escapes from the Sun as light. The spectrographic study of this layer has allowed scientists to confirm that the main components of the Sun are hydrogen and helium. CHROMOSPHERE Above the photosphere, and of less density, lies the chromosphere, a layer 3,110 miles (5,000 km) thick. Its temperature ranges from 8,100° F (4,500° C) to 900,000° F (500,000° C) with increasing altitude. The temperature of the corona can reach 1,800,000° F (1,000,000° C). CORONA Located above the chromosphere, it extends millions of miles into space and reaches temperatures nearing 1,800,000° F (1,000,000° C). It has some holes, or low- density regions, through which gases flow into the solar wind.

The Sun loses approximately 1,800 pounds (800 kg) of matter per second in the form of solar wind. SPICULES Vertical jets of gas that spew from the chromosphere, usually reaching 6,200 miles (10,000 km) in height. They originate in upper convection cells and can rise as high as the corona. SOLAR PROMINENCES Clouds and layers of gas from the chromosphere travel thousands of miles until they reach the corona, where the influence of magnetic fields causes them to take on the shape of an arc or wave. T he Sun at the center of the solar system is a source of light and heat. This energy is produced by the fusion of atomic hydrogen nuclei, which generate helium nuclei. The energy that emanates from the Sun travels through space and initially encounters the bodies that populate the solar system. The Sun shines thanks to thermonuclear fusion, and it will continue to shine until its supply of hydrogen runs out in about six or seven billion years. UMBRA Central region.

For every four hydrogen nuclei, a series of nuclear reactions produce one helium nucleus. RADIATIVE ZONE This portion of the Sun is traversed by particles coming from the core.

UNIVERSE 45 44 THE SOLAR SYSTEM Like the Earth, Mercury has a magnetic field, although a much weaker one. The magnetism results from its enormous core made of solid iron. The mantle that surrounds the core is believed to be a fine layer of iron and sulfur. Composition and Magnetic Field Mercury rotates slowly on its axis and takes approximately 59 Earth days to complete a turn, but it only needs 88 days to travel in its orbit. To an observer in Mercury, these two combined motions would give a combined interval of 176 days between two sunrises. A person observing the sunrise from position 1 would have to wait for the planet to make two orbits around the Sun and make three rotations on its own axis before seeing the next sunrise.

Due to its proximity to the Sun, Mercury moves at great speed in its solar orbit, completing an orbit every 88 days. It has almost no atmosphere, and its surface is dry and rugged, covered with craters caused by the impact of numerous meteorites; this makes it resemble the Moon. Numerous faults, formed during the cooling of the planet when it was young, are also visible on the surface.

The current one is some 500 million years old, but the rocky landscape visible today was formed by intense volcanic activity. Volcanic rock covers 85 percent of the planet. The entire planet is crisscrossed by vast plains and enormous rivers of lava, as well as a number of mountains. The lava flows have created a great number of grooves, some of which are very wide. The brightness of Venus's surface is the result of metallic compounds. The overwhelming presence of carbon dioxide in the Venusian atmosphere induces a greenhouse effect, increasing the surface temperature to 864° F (462° C). Because of this, Venus is hotter than Mercury, even though Venus is farther from the Sun and reflects all but 20 percent of the Sun's light. The surface temperature of Venus is relatively constant, averaging 860° F (460° C). The atmospheric pressure on Venus is 90 times greater than that on the Earth. Composition VENUS'S PHASES As Venus revolves around the Sun, its solar illumination varies as is seen from the Earth depending upon its position in relation to the Sun and the Earth. Thus Venus has phases similar to the Moon's.

Venus has no magnetic field—possibly because of its slow axial rotation. The surface of Venus is rocky and dry. Most of the planet is formed by volcanic plains and other, elevated regions. CRUST Made up of silicates, it is thicker than the Earth's crust. Venus lacks water. A U.S. robot probe sent to Venus in 1978 found some evidence that water vapor could have existed in the atmosphere hundreds of millions of years ago, but today no trace of water remains. MANTLE Made of molten rock, it constitutes most of the planet. It traps the solar radiation and is between 37 and 62 miles (60 and 100 km) thick.

The thick clouds of dust, sulfuric acid, and carbon dioxide that constitute Venus's atmosphere reflect the remaining light, leaving Venus in permanent darkness. SOLAR RADIATION Venus is kept hot by its thick atmosphere, which retains the energy of the Sun's rays. INFRARED RAYS The surface of Venus radiates infrared radiation. Only 20 percent of the Sun's rays pass through Venus's thick clouds of sulfuric acid. ISHTAR TERRA One of the raised plateaus of Venus, it is similar in size to Australia and is located close to Venus's north pole. It has four main rocky mountain ranges called Maxwell Montes, Freyja Montes, Akna Montes, and Dam Montes. APHRODITE TERRA Larger than Ishtar Terra, it is the size of South America. Aphrodite Terra lies near the equator and consists mostly of mountainous regions to the east and west, which are separated by a low-lying region. ATMOSPHERE Venus's glowing appearance is caused by the planet's thick, suffocating atmosphere, which is made up of carbon dioxide and sulfuric clouds that reflect sunlight. 97% Carbon dioxide Venus, Our Neighbor V enus is the second closest planet to the Sun. Similar in size to the Earth, it has a volcanic surface, as well as a hostile atmosphere governed by the effects of carbon dioxide. Although about four billion years ago the atmospheres of the Earth and Venus were similar, the mass of Venus's atmosphere today is 100 times greater than the Earth's. Its thick clouds of sulfuric acid and dust are so dense that stars are invisible from the planet's surface. Viewed from the Earth, Venus can be bright enough to be visible during day and second only to the moon in brightness at night.

Temperatures on Mars range from -220° F to 62° F (-140° C to 17° C). Composition Mars, a rocky planet, has an iron-rich core. Mars is almost half the size of the Earth and has a similar period of rotation, as well as clearly evident clouds, winds, and other weather phenomena. Its thin atmosphere is made up of carbon dioxide, and its red color comes from its soil, which is rich in iron oxide. Surface It is a place of geologic extremes, shaped by volcanic activity, meteorite bombardment, windstorms, and floods (though there is little or no water on Mars today).

The bands' small differences in temperature and chemical composition give the planet its multicolored appearance. Jupiter's inclement environment, in which winds blow at more than 370 miles per hour (600 km/h), can cause large storms, such as the Great Red Spot in the southern hemisphere of the planet. The Great Red Spot, which is 16,155 miles (26,000 km) long, is believed to be composed mainly of ammonia gas and clouds of ice. The Moons of Jupiter Jupiter's magnetic field is 20,000 times stronger than the Earth's. Astronomers believe the field is caused by the electrical currents that are created by the rapid rotation of metallic hydrogen. Jupiter is surrounded by a huge magnetic bubble, the magnetosphere.

They have been called double planets—the diameter of Charon is about that of Pluto. One theory hypothesizes that Charon was formed from ice that was torn from Pluto when another object collided with the dwarf planet. In addition to Charon, which was discovered in 1978, Pluto is orbited by two additional moons, Nix and Hydra, first observed in 2005. Unlike the surface of Pluto, which is made of frozen nitrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide, Charon appears to be covered with ice, methane, and carbon dioxide. One theory holds that the matter that formed this satellite was ejected from Pluto as a result of a collision, an origin similar to that ascribed to Earth's moon. Composition Scientific calculations have deduced that 75 percent of Pluto consists of a mixture of rocks and ice. This frozen surface is made up of 98 percent nitrogen, as well as traces of solidified carbon monoxide and methane. Recently scientists have concluded that Pluto is an object that belongs to the Kuiper belt, a group of objects left over from the formation of the outer planets. In addition to large amounts of frozen nitrogen, Pluto has simple molecules containing hydrogen and oxygen, the building blocks of life. Surface Only a little is known about Pluto, but the Hubble Space Telescope showed a surface covered by a frozen mixture of nitrogen and methane. The presence of solid methane indicates that its temperature is less than -333° F (-203° C), but the dwarf planet's temperature varies according to its place in orbit, ranging between 30 and 50 astronomical units from the Sun.

F arther even than Neptune, the eighth planet, we find frozen bodies smaller than the Earth's Moon—the more than 100,000 objects forming the Kuiper belt, the frozen boundary of our solar system. Recently astronomers of the International Astronomical Union decided to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf planet because of its size and eccentric orbit.

STONY UNIVERSE 63 62 THE SOLAR SYSTEM Construction Debris: Asteroids and Meteorites E ver since the formation of the solar system, the melting, collision, and rupture of various materials played an essential role in the formation of the planets. Remnants of this process remain in the form of rock debris, which serves as witnesses to the formation of the solar system. These objects are also associated with episodes that influenced subsequent evolutionary processes on Earth. They are a possible cause of the mass extinction of dinosaurs more than 60 million years ago. Extraterrestrial One of the main goals of scientist who study meteorites is to understand their nature. Meteoric material holds extraterrestrial solids and gases. Scientific tests have confirmed that some meteorites are from the Moon or Mars, but most meteorites are associated with asteroids. The samples obtained from meteorites are analyzed and classified by their composition. Asteroids Also called minor planets, they are the millions of rock and metal fragments of various shapes and sizes that orbit the Sun. They are mostly located in a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but a few, such as those that belong to the Amor, Apollo, and Aten asteroid groups, orbit closer to Earth. Tighten Your Belt More than a million asteroids at least a mile in diameter are distributed in the main asteroid belt. Ceres was the first asteroid discovered (in 1801). It is the largest known asteroid, with a diameter of 580 miles (932 km). 7 miles per second (12 km/s) IMPACT VELOCITY TYPES OF METEORITES EXPLOSION The friction created as a meteorite falls through the air increases its temperature. This is how an ignition process is started. 1. DIVISION The fragmentation of a meteorite causes a visual effect called a shooting star. 2.

This material gradually grew into a larger and larger body that became a red-hot ball of rock and metal. Later the rocky crust formed, its surface cooling enough to allow the continents to appear. Even later the oceans arrived, as well as the tiny organisms that released oxygen into the atmosphere. Although much of this gas was initially consumed in chemical reactions, over time, it allowed the development of multicellular organisms and an explosion of life that took place at the start of the Paleozoic Era, 542 million years ago. Chronology Geology is the study of rocks in the Earth’s crust. It divides the Earth’s history into different eras, periods, and epochs lasting millions of years. Geology also helps us catalog the processes of evolution—changes in generations as species adapt to their environment and their competitors. Through the study of fossils—remains of creatures buried in the Earth’s various sedimentary layers and consequently at different times in the past– geology helps us trace the timeline of evolutionary history. Continental Drift We live on the continents, which are part of movable plates that drift across the Earth’s surface at the rate a fingernail grows. 250 million years ago, India, Africa, Australia, and Antarctica were part of the same continent. When tectonic plates rub against each other, land and oceanic crust earthquakes occur. Where the plates separate, a rift forms. The mid-ocean ridges that run beneath the oceans are formed by lava that emerges from the rifts between tectonic plates. Where plates collide, a process called subduction takes place, in which the rocks of the oceanic floor are drawn under the continent and melt, reemerging in the form of volcanoes. Origin of the Earth The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of dust and gas. In the beginning, it was a molten, constantly active, mass.

The Earth rotates on its axis while simultaneously orbiting the Sun. The natural phenomena of night and day, seasons, and years are caused by these movements. To track the passage of time, calendars, clocks, and time zones were invented. Time zones are divided by meridians and assigned a reference hour according to their location. When traveling east, an hour is added with each time zone. An hour is subtracted during west-bound travel. The Earth’s Movements Night and day, summer and winter, new year and old year result from the Earth’s various movements during its orbit of the Sun. The most important motions are the Earth’s daily rotation from west to east on its own axis and its revolution around the Sun. (The Earth follows an elliptical orbit that has the Sun at one of the foci of the ellipse, so the distance to the Sun varies slightly over the course of a year.) JET LAG The human body’s biological clock responds to the rhythms of light and dark based on the passage of night and day. Long air flights east or west interrupt and disorient the body’s clock, causing a disorder known as jet lag. It can cause fatigue, irritability, nausea, headaches, and difficulty sleeping at night. Time Zones The Earth is divided into 24 areas, or time zones, each one of which corresponds to an hour assigned according to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), using the Greenwich, June 20 or 21 Summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere and winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere. Solstices exist because of the tilt of the Earth’s axis. The length of the day and the height of the Sun in the sky are greatest in summer and least in winter.

Without the Earth’s atmosphere, during each lunar eclipse, the Moon would become completely invisible (something that never happens). The totally eclipsed Moon’s characteristic reddish color is caused by light refracted by the Earth’s atmosphere. During a partial eclipse, on the other hand, part of the Moon falls in the shadow cone, while the rest is in the penumbra, the outermost, palest part. It is not dangerous to look at a lunar eclipse directly. TOTAL The Moon is completely in the shadow cone. Moon Earth Sun PARTIAL The Moon is only partially inside the shadow cone. PENUMBRAL The Moon is in the penumbral cone. ALIGNMENT TYPES OF ECLIPSES During a solar eclipse, astronomers take advantage of the blocked view of the Sun in order to use devices designed to study the Sun’s atmosphere. Solar Eclipse Solar eclipses occur when the Moon passes directly between the Sun and the Earth, casting a shadow along a path on the Earth’s surface. The central cone of the shadow is called the umbra, and the area of partial shadow around it is called the penumbra. Viewers in the regions where the umbra falls on the Earth’s surface see the Moon’s disk completely obscure the Sun—a total solar eclipse. Those watching from the surrounding areas that are located in the penumbra see the Moon’s disk cover only part of the Sun—a partial solar eclipse. TOTAL The Moon is between the Sun and the Earth and creates a cone- shaped shadow. ANNULAR The Sun appears larger than the Moon, and it remains visible around it. PARTIAL The Moon does not cover the Sun completely, so the Sun appears as a crescent. THE ECLIPSE CYCLE Eclipses repeat every 223 lunations—18 years and 11 days. These are called Saros periods.

Today, thanks to advances in new technologies, such as the giant telescopes installed in various locations around the planet, we have discovered many new things about the universe.

The Sun, the Moon, and the planets were thought to orbit it. To study the sky and calculate its movements, people began to build instruments, such as the astrolabe, armillary sphere, and telescope. The telescope revolutionized the conception of the universe. Instead of the Earth being at the center of the universe, it was suggested that the Earth and other planets travel around the Sun. The Roman Catholic Church opposed the idea and, for a time, persecuted dissident astronomers and banned their theories. In 1543, a few months before his death, Nicolaus Copernicus published the book De revolutionibus orbium coelestium , inaugurating what is now known as the Copernican Revolution. The Polish astronomer developed the heliocentric theory (from helios , the Greek word for “the Sun”), which contradicted the geocentric theory. Copernicus’s new postulate inverted the traditional relationship of the Sun and the Earth, identifying the Sun as the center of the universe and the Earth as one of many solar satellites. Copernicus argued that spheres moved in endless, circular orbits. Since the universe and all the celestial bodies were thought to be spherical, he argued that their movements must also be circular and uniform (the Ptolemaic system considered the planets’ circuits to be irregular). Copernicus reasoned that, since the movements of the planets appeared to be irregular, the Earth must not be the center of the universe. These discoveries were contrary to the views promulgated by the Roman Catholic Church. In fact, both Roman Catholics and Protestants suppressed any writings advocating these beliefs. When Galileo Galilei was brought to trial by the Roman Catholic Church for advocating the Copernican theory, he was forced to renounce his views. Heliocentric Model GALILEO’S TELESCOPE The telescope is thought to have been invented in 1609 by the Dutch optician Hans Lippershey but had no real scientific application until Galileo Galilei improved and adapted it to observe celestial bodies. Galileo’s first telescope, made of a leather tube covered by a lens at each end (one lens convex and the other concave), magnified objects up to 30 times. Using the telescope, Galileo discovered that the Sun’s surface had imperfections (sunspots), that the Moon had mountains and craters, and that there were four moons, or satellites, that traveled around Jupiter. MEASUREMENTS Noticing that the Sun, the Moon, and the stars moved in cycles, ancient civilizations found they could use the sky as both a clock and a calendar. However, ancient astronomers had difficulties performing the complex calculations needed to predict the positions of stars accurately enough to create a truly precise calendar. A useful tool developed to perform this task was the astrolabe. Its engraved plates reproduce the celestial sphere in two dimensions, allowing the elevations of the celestial bodies to be measured. THE TRAVELERS After many years and great advancements in technology, scientists decided that space observation conducted only from the Earth’s surface was insufficient. In 1959, the first space probe was launched, an automatic vehicle that flew to the Moon and photographed its hidden face. The space probes Voyager 1 and 2 explored the planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, a milestone in space exploration. In 2005, Voyager 1 reached the region called Termination Shock, the frontier of the solar system, representing the farthest region explored by humanity. Both probes carried with them golden discs, named Sounds of Earth, containing sounds and images portraying the diversity of life on Earth. 2nd Century Claudius Ptolemy 100-170 Resurrected and compiled the works of great Greek astronomers into two books. His postulates held undisputed authority for centuries. 16th Century Nicolaus Copernicus 1473-1543 In his De revolutionibus orbium coelestium , the Polish astronomer postulated that the Sun—not the Earth—was the center of the universe. This concept is the foundation of our own astronomy.. 20th Century Edwin Hubble 1889-1953 In 1929, he began to investigate the expansion of the galaxies, allowing scientists to obtain an idea of the true scale of the universe as well as refine the big bang theory. 17th Century Isaac Newton 1642-1727 He built upon the ideas of Galileo and developed the theory of universal gravitation, asserting that the movements of the Earth and the celestial bodies are governed by the same natural laws. Astronomical Theories 17th Century 17th Century Galileo Galilei 1564-1642 Built the first telescope, a primitive device with which he discovered sunspots, four of Jupiter’s moons, the phases of Venus, and craters on the Moon’s surface. Before telescopes, binoculars, and modern observatories existed, little was known about the Earth. Many believed that the Earth was fixed and that the Sun, the Moon, and the five known planets orbited it in circles. This geocentric model was promoted by the Egyptian astronomer Claudius Ptolemy, who in the 2nd century AD compiled the astronomical ideas of the ancient Greek astronomers (in particular, those of Aristotle, who had proposed the Earth as the center of the universe, with the celestial objects revolving around it). Although other ancient astronomers, such as Aristarchus of Samus, proposed that the Earth was round and rotated around the Sun, Aristotle’s ideas were accepted as true for 16 centuries, and at times Aristotle’s ideas were defended and preserved by the Roman Catholic Church. Geocentric Model TIME This astrolabe was used by ancient Persians. To them, astronomy functioned as a kind of agricultural calendar. Johannes Kepler 1571-1630 The German astronomer, believer in Copernicus’s heliocentric model, formulated three famous laws of planetary movement, which encouraged Galileo to publish his research.

Saiph ORIGIN The history of western culture’s constellations begins with the first astronomical observations made by ancient Mesopotamian peoples. Because we inherited the constellations from Greco- Roman culture, most of the constellations are named after figures in classical mythology. All of the earliest constellations were named by the 16th century. Constellations discovered more recently bear names drawn from science or technology or from exotic fauna discovered in various places across the globe. Xi Orionis Sprinkled with Stars Mu Orionis Rigel UNIVERSE 85 Mythological Characters Since ancient times, animal figures have been seen represented in the sky by groups of stars. The constellation of Taurus takes its name from its resemblance to a bull. Orion, Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Perseus were named after characters of Greek tragedies. The Sky Changes The Earth takes one year to orbit the Sun. As the planet advances in its orbit, the nighttime sky changes, allowing different parts of it to be seen. This is why some constellations can only be seen during certain seasons of the year. In addition, different constellations can be seen from different latitudes. Only near the equator is it possible to see all 88 constellations. Different Cultures In antiquity, each culture recognized certain constellations that other civilizations did not. The Chinese see smaller, more detailed patterns in the stars, allowing for more precise positional information. Various cultures also tend to use varied names for the same constellation. Scorpius is recognized by the people of Mesopotamia, Greece, Rome, Mesoamerica, and Oceania—under different names. The Constellations of the Zodiac The 13 constellations located within the elliptical plane— through which the Sun passes as seen from Earth—are called the constellations of the zodiac. Twelve of these constellations have long formed the foundation of astrology, but Ophiuchus, the 13th, is ignored by astrologers as a new addition. URSA MAJOR The bear represented by this constellation is unusual because of its long tail. The constellations’ shapes rarely agree perfectly with their namesakes. SCORPIUS In Greco-Roman mythology, Orion and Scorpius are closely linked. Orion is the giant, handsome, seductive hunter. THE CENTAUR is a creature from Greek mythology, half man and half horse. The centaur accompanied Orion during his quest to recover his sight. OBSERVING THE CONSTELLATIONS Observers in both hemispheres can see the constellations of the zodiac. In the Northern Hemisphere, the southern constellations, such as Scorpius, are difficult to see, and in the Southern Hemisphere, northern constellations, such as Gemini, are difficult to study.

Just as terrestrial maps help us find locations on the surface of the planet, star charts use a similar coordinate system to indicate various celestial bodies and locations. Planispheres, or star wheels, are based on the idea of a celestial sphere (an imaginary globe on which the stars appear to lie and that surrounds the planet). Two common types are polar and bimonthly star maps. M A P O F T H E S T E L L A R N O R T H P O L E M A P O F T H E S T E L L A R S O U T H P O L E UNIVERSE 87 Different Types of Charts Throughout the year, different constellations are visible because the Earth moves along its orbit. As the Earth’s place in its orbit changes, the night side of the planet faces different regions of space. To compensate for this shifting perspective, there are various kinds of planispheres: north and south polar maps and bimonthly equatorial maps. Stellar Movements The visible regions of the celestial sphere and the ways in which stars move through the sky depend upon the observer’s latitude. As an observer moves north or south, the visible portion of the celestial sphere will change. The elevation of the north or south celestial pole above the horizon determines the apparent motion of the stars in the sky. Measuring Distances Once a star or constellation has been located in the sky, hands and arms can serve as simple measuring tools. A single extended finger, shown in the first illustration, can form a one-degree angle from the observer’s line of sight and is useful for measuring short distances between stars. The closed palm of the hand forms a 10° angle, and the open hand measures 20°. THE CELESTIAL SPHERE The celestial sphere is imagined to extend around the Earth and forms the basis for modern star cartography. The sphere is divided into a network of lines and coordinates corresponding to those used on the Earth, allowing an observer to locate constellations on the sphere. The celestial equator is a projection of the Earth’s equator, the north and south celestial poles align with the axis of the Earth, and the elliptic coincides with the path along which the Sun appears to move. POLAR The celestial sphere is generally divided into two polar maps: north and south. AT THE POLES At the North Pole, the stars appear to rotate around the observer’s head. The effect is the same at the South Pole but in the opposite direction. IN MIDDLE LATITUDES some stars can be seen all year long, but others are only visible during certain months. AT THE EQUATOR stars can be seen throughout the year, rising in the east and setting in the west. EQUATORIAL Six bimonthly maps depict all 88 constellations, which can be seen over the course of the year. ONE FINGER FULL MOON BIG DIPPER THE SQUARE OF PEGASUS CLOSED HAND OPEN HAND Star magnitudes Constellations Milky Way HOW TO READ A MAP OF THE SKY Astronomers divide the celestial sphere into sections, allowing them to study the sky in detailed, systematic ways. These maps can show a particular region observed from a certain place at a certain time, or they can merely concentrate on a specific location. To specify the position of a point on the surface of the Earth, the geographic coordinates called latitude and longitude are used. With the celestial sphere, declination and right ascension are used instead.

Planets, stars, and galaxies have magnetic fields that extend into space. Magnetosphere Sphere that surrounds a planet with a magnetic field strong enough to protect the planet from the solar wind. Mantle Layer that lies between the crust and the core of a planet. Mass Measure of the amount of matter in an object. Matter The substance of a physical object, it occupies a portion of space. Meteorite Rocky or metallic object that strikes the surface of a planet or satellite, where it can form a crater. Milky Way The galaxy to which the Sun and the solar system belong. It is visible as a pale band of light that crosses our night sky. Molecule Smallest unit of a pure substance that has the composition and chemical properties of the substance. It is formed by one or more atoms. January 4, when it is 92,000,000 miles (147,500,000 km) from the Sun. Photon Elemental particle responsible for electromagnetic radiation. Photons are the most common particles in the universe. Planet Roughly spherical object made of rocks or gas orbiting a star. A planet cannot generate its own light but reflects the light of its parent star. Polestar Polaris, a star that lies near the celestial north pole. Polaris is commonly called the North Star. Over thousands of years, other stars will become the polestar. Proton Subatomic particle with positive electrical charge. It forms part of the nucleus of an atom. Radio Galaxy Active galaxy emitting energy as both radio waves and light. Most of the radio emission originates at the core of the galaxy. Solar Flare Immense explosion produced on the surface of the Sun by the collision of two loops of the solar magnetic field. Solar Mass Standard unit of mass against which other objects in the universe can be compared. The Sun has 333,000 times as much mass as the Earth. Space The medium through which all celestial bodies move. Space-Time Four-dimensional conception of the universe in which length, width, and height constitute three dimensions and time acts as the fourth. Spectral Analysis Study of spectral lines that provide information about the composition of stars or galaxies and their redshifts. Spectrum The result of dispersing the electromagnetic radiation of an object so that the wavelengths of which it is composed can be seen. Dark lines that originate from elements that are present and punctuate the spectrum at specific wavelengths reveal the composition of the object. Speed of Light The distance traveled by light in a vacuum in one second (approximately 186,000 miles, or 300,000 km). No object can move faster than the speed of light. Star Enormous sphere of gas (generally hydrogen) that radiates light and heat. The Sun is a star. Star Cluster Group of stars linked together by gravity. Open clusters are scattered groups of several hundred stars. Globular clusters are dense spheres of several million old stars. Sunspots Dark, relatively cool spots on the surface of the Sun. They tend to be located on either side of the solar equator and are created by the solar magnetic field. Supernova Explosion of a massive star at the end of its life. Tide The effect of the gravitational pull of one astronomical object upon the surface of another. Ocean tides on Earth are an example. Unstable Tendency to change from one state into another less energetic one. Radioactive elements decay into more stable elements. Vacuum Space occupied by little or no matter. Van Allen Belt Radiation zone surrounding the Earth, where the Earth's magnetic field traps solar particles. Wavelength Distance between the peaks of any wave of electromagnetic radiation. Radiation with a short wavelength (such as X-rays) has more energy than radiation with a longer wavelength (such as radio waves). Zenith Point in the sky 90° above the horizon (that is, immediately above an observer). Zodiac Twelve constellations through which the Sun, the Moon, and the planets appear to move. Moon The Earth's natural satellite is called the Moon. The natural satellites of other planets are commonly known as moons and have their own proper names. Nebulae Clouds of gas and dust in space. Nebulae can be seen when they reflect starlight or when they obstruct light from sources behind them. Neutron Electrically neutral subatomic particle. It makes up part of an atom's nucleus (with the exception of ordinary hydrogen). Neutron Star Collapsed star consisting mostly of neutrons. Nova Star that increases greatly in brightness for several days or weeks and then slowly fades. Most novae probably occur in binary-star systems in which a white dwarf draws in matter from its companion star. Nuclear Fusion Nuclear reaction in which relatively light elements (such as hydrogen) form heavier elements (such as helium). Nuclear fusion is the source of energy that makes stars shine. Oxygen Chemical element vital to life and to the expansion of the universe. Oxygen makes up 21 percent of the Earth's atmosphere. Particle In particle physics, a tiny, individual component of matter with characteristic mass, electrical charge, and other properties. Perihelion The point in a celestial body's orbit closest to the Sun. The Earth reaches perihelion on or about"},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"96 INDEX UNIVERSE 97 Index A accretion disc, 30, 34, 35, 37 active galaxy, 34-35 adaptive optics system, 91 annular solar
