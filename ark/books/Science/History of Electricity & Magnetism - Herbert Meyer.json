We now stand in awe of the space age, andin fear we face the nuclear age. From electricity, however, has been drawn an ever growing abundance of light, power, warmth, intelligence, and medical aid-ail beneficent, silent, and ready Electricity is the one force in the arsenal of man that found no precedent in carlier history, nor was it drawn frorn classical times. It is fully the fruit of the Enlighten- ment, in timc and place, and it generated its own enlighten- ment by extending man’s waking hours and making him master of his own dawn and night. With no more than the touch of his finger he cari summon energy ahnost without limit and cari as readily cancel his summons. He cari control bis environment, he cooled when he wishes it or be warmed when needed. H C cari, in an instant, speak to anyone in any location where the fine filaments that carry this new force bave been extended. Ile ca”, at Will, observe and lista to public figures presenting problems of state or be enter- tained by whatever his choice of talent might be. No czar or emperor could command more. With this new force mari has probed the universe around him and has been compelled to change his estimates of its size exponentially. With radio astronomy he has penetrated distances measured in billions of light-years. He bas probed the elemental nature of matter and energy; his genius challenged by their complexity, he devised new electronic probes and analytical instruments. His networks of com- puters bave extended his intellectual powers (if not"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"xii Forcword his wisdom) beyond a11 philosophie dreams. His weapons of destruction are diffused in hundreds of locations in the ground, in the sea, and in the air, each weapon’s destructive strength measured in the equivalent megatons of explosive and a11 controlled by electrical energy equiva- lent to the power of a flea, the signal traveling over a hot line. With such knowledge, such power, such control of envi- ronment, and su& fleet means of communication, man has demonstrated his ability to reach the moon, travel its harsh surface, and return to earth-recording and televising his position, observations, and thoughts during the entire jour- ney. This, and more, was realized in only a little more than a decade from the decision to attempt such a difficult mis- sion. Admittedly, the acquisition of electricity as an instrument of power and control in the inventory of man’s abilities was no small addition. One cari therefore stop and inquire about the circumstances that brought this acquisition about and review the events and personalities whose labors revealed the characteristics of a force unknown throughout the ear- lier millenia of work and study. Two events ushered in the interest that blossomed into the arcane realm of electricity and magnetism. The first was the publication in London of a book on electricity and magne- tism written by the physician to Queen Elizabeth who had devoted his leisure time and much of his fortune to investi- gating the properties of magnets and electrified bodies. Dr. William Gilbert’s book, De Magnete, was published in Latin in 1600; its strength lay in the thoroughness with which the author examined each claim made in earlier writ- ings on electrical phenomena, magnets, and compasses and in the exhaustive experimentation that separated the undis-"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Porewurd xiii puted results of his observations from the accumulated superstitious clairns of the past. This launched the science of electriçity and magnetism Gem a firm bais of perfor- mance derived from objective experimentation. The second event of significance that pushed electricity ou its way toward usefulness was an announcement made in 1800 by Alessaudro Volta that a new forrn of electricity could be drawn from a pile of altemating zinc and silver disks stacked oue on the other, eaçh pair separated from thc adjoining pair by a cloth or papa disk saturated in brine. From the ends of this pile, Volta could draw a con- tinuously flowing electric current, which he and others soon uscd 10 decompose water, to cause charcoal to glow with intense light in au electric arc, and, later, to deposit met& by electrolysis. These two events-Gilhert’s book on magnetisrn (1600) and Volta’s constant-current clectric cell (1800)-represent two çenturies that neatly bracketcd the naseent phase of electrical development. ‘I‘he one formulated more accurate kuowledge about a force thcn useful for navigation in an era of voyaging and exploration; thc other çhanged the con- cept of electric generation from frictional clectricity, giving off bigger and bigger sparks, into an eleçtric source of vast potential. However, the period must not be closed without tribute being paid to Franklin, an intrepid experimenter, who ideutified lightning as electricity and with his lightning rod helpcd rescue mankind from the terrer of destroyed homes, steeples, and other structures. At the same time he helped guide man’s faith to the trurr character of natural forces sud away from the ancient superstitions about light- ning and the gods’ intentions. Tbe next important step on the ranrp of electrical progress was Lhe discovery by Oersted in 1820 that a wire connect-"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"xiv Foreword ing the ends of a voltaic pile was enveloped by a magnetic field. It was then found that if such a wire were looped into a coi1 the magnetic strength was greatly intensified. With such a magnetic field Faraday showed, in 1831, that a moving electrical conductor had an electric current induced in it; the electric generator and its important adjunct, the transformer, were thus born. The generator supplied elec- trie current in abundance and with this and auxiliary cur- rent from electric batteries the electric telegraph devel- oped-the first important instantaneous disseminator of human intelligence over long distances. There followed the laying of the first transatlantic table, the telephone, the electric lamp, and the electric motor. Each development generated a family of by-products-electroplating, the elec- trie tramway, the moving picture-and each created a cor- responding major industry. As the drama of electrical development unfolds, we relate each forward step to the genius and perseverance of some experimenter, some inventor, some innovator. T O him should go a11 the honor of a grateful people, for these are the true heroes of the modern world. The pages that follow Will unfold their story, their struggles and attainments. May the telling never end. Bern Dibner"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"PREFACE PURPOSE OF BOOK It is the purpose OC this book to attempt to give to the reader, who bas arrived upon the wortd scene in the midst of a scientific explosion, a sense of perspective and direc- tion. The word explosion as it is used here is not entirety accurate because it implies a sudden, violent, and instanta- mous event. Ttre burgeoning of science resembtes more nearly the propagation of a new grain Crom a few seeds, to a few bushets, and finatly to a tremendous harvest. A history such as tbis might be presented as a collection of biographies or as a series of stories concerning inventions and discoveries. It could discuss tbc unfotding of events from the standpoint of pure science or it might be weighted on the side of technotogy. Att of these considerations bave played a part in tbe writing of this story. Hopefutty the book has blended these differing viewpoints in such a way as to stimutate the interest, not onty of the student of science, but atso that of the casuat reader, who finds him- self surrounded by the fruits of science and technotogy, knowing not from whence they came. EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL RESEARCH During the earty period of the devetopment of etectrical and magnetic science, beginning witb William Gilbert and Otto van Guericke, discoveries were the resutt of experi- ment coupted with observation and interpretation.

Maxwell, an ardent admirer of Faraday’s great genius, in- terpreted Faraday’s discoveries mathematically and contrib- uted his own mathematical findings, but credit for some of Maxwell’s discoveries must be shared with Helmholtz, whose versatility in science has rarely been equaled. After Maxwell and Helmholtz followed a period of twenty or more years of fruitful experimentation. As a result of the Michelson-Morley experiment, Lorentz and Einstein brought forth new concepts of length and time that seri- ously upset the Newtonian system. Under the new theory length and time were no longer absolutes but were relative, and Newton’s laws were valid only as special cases. Even more upsetting was the suggestion that matter and energy were convertible, one into the other. These great triumphs of theoretical science were only a beginning, and there was much more to corne. The nature of matter and energy became the primary abject of physical research with most astonishing results. This type of research began with the work of J. J. Thomson, Planck, Lenard, Moseley, Rutherford, and Bohr, followed a few years later by the astonishing revelations of A. H. Compton, C. T. R. Wilson, de Broglie, Schrodinger, Heisenberg, Pauli, Born, Dirac, Davisson, Germer, G. P. Thomson, and Kikuchi. MERGING OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES As the nature of matter and its relationship to energy be- came clearer, the gaps between the branches of physical science began to close, and the lines of demarcation became indistinct. It is therefore difficult in a work such as this to avoid being drawn into byways only remotely connected with the subject matter."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"xvii Prefaee ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author wishes to express his appreciation for the en- couragement and suggestions given by Dr. R.

Prehistoric mari fashioned weapons, ta&, uiensils: and clothing from stone, shells, bone, wood, skins, and sinews. Later he learned to use met&, such as copper and gold, which were foond in their native state and required no smelting. Bronze, which is usually an alloy of çopper and tin. carne into use in Europe by the year 2000 B.C., or perhaps earlier, and gave rise to the period known as the Bronze Age. There is no reliable record as to the date when the smelt- ing of the ores of copper, tin, lead, and zinc began, but these met& were definitely in use before the beginning of the Christian Era. The Romans mined copper or copper ores in Cyprus and later obtained tin from Gxnwall in England. It is difficult to determine the date of the earliest iron implements, but iron artifacts bave been iound in Egypt dating back to 4000 B.C. Iran in its native state occurs only in meteorites and in tiny needles sometimes found in ba- salta. Little is known as to the date when mari first pro- duced iron from ores, but there is evidence that by 1350 B.C. the Hittites in Asia Miner succeeded in reducing the oxides of iron. MAGNETITE AND TIfE LODESTONE There are probably few natural rnaterials known today that were not also known to prehistoric mari, although he had"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"2 Chapter One little knowledge of their uses. Among the rather widespread and fairly abundant minerals of the earth is a very useful ore of iron called magnetite, which has the composition Fes04. It is a crystalline minera& very dark in color, having a metallic luster, and a specific gravity equal to about five- sevenths of that of iron. Unlike any of the other iron ores it is magnetic, and this property gives it its name. There are occasional pieces of magnetite, as found in nature, which are permanently magnetized, and such pieces are known as loadstones or lodestones. In some specimens the magnetism is sufficiently strong to enable them to lift several times their weight of iron from one pole. There is good reason to believe that the attractive powers of lodestone had been observed as much as 3000 years before the Christian Era, but the directive properties of freely suspended pieces were probably not known until much later. We are told that Huang-ti, or Hwang-ti, or Hoang-ti, an emperor of China in the year 2637 B.C., had a chariot upon which was mounted the figure of a woman, pivoted or sus- pended SO that it was free to turn in any direction. The outstretched arm of the statue pointed always to the south under the influence of concealed lodestones. Similar magnetic cars are mentioned by Chinese historians at various times down to the early centuries of the Christian Era. The Chinese also discovered that steel needles could be permanently magnetized by the lodestone and used as com- passes. According to Humboldt, Tcheou-Koung, Chinese minister of state in 1110 B.C., used a compass employing a steel needle, and the same authority relates that Chinese mariners with the aid of compasses navigated the Indian Ocean, in the third Century A.D. Unlike the ancient civilizations of the West which per- ished, the Chinese civilization has continued in an almost"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"unbroken line down-to the present time, SO that its recorded history is fa more comptete than that of Babyton or Egypt. ‘There is some disagreemerrt among sçhotars as to whether or not the stories conccrning thc use of magnetic chariots or magnetic needtes, by the Chinese, is façt or fiction. Sinçe, however, such devices are possible, and since such stories recur from time to time in Chinese history and leg- end, there seems ta be little rcason to rcject them. THALES OF MILETUS In 600 H . C . Greek çivilization and commerce were flouri& ing. On the Grecian peninsula the City-states of Athens and Sparta hûd grown ta greatuess and power. Nurnerous Greek colonies had beerl planted on tbe shores of the Mediter- ranean and Aegean seas, amorrg whicb was Ionia in Asia Miner. Miletus was a thriving seaport in lonia, in and out of which sailed ships from all of the ports of the Mediter- ranean. Its inhabitants, througb their trade with other coun- tries, became well-ta-do and acquired much of the culture of olher civilizations o f the Mediterranean basin. Philos- ophy, astronomy, mathcmatics, poetry, and art were culti- vated atong with commerce. One of thc inhabitants of Miletus in the year 600 B.C. n-as the philosopher Thales (64OL546 B.C.). A contemporary of Draco, Soton, and of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, he was the founder of the Io&n school of philosophy from which Socrates came. Thales traveled extensively and re- ceiwd an important part of his çducation from the priests at Memphis and Thebes in EQpt. Froln them he learned a great deal about thc physical sciences and geometry, andin the latter he S<><>I~ exce II e d bis tcachers. Thales’s life was devoted to teaching, discussion, philosophy, and statecraft. Ilnforturlately for posterity hc left no writings, and all that"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"4 Chapter One we know of him was transmitted orally until Aristotle re- corded his teachings. Thales is important in electrical history because he was the first person who is said to have observed the electrical prop- erties of amber. He noted that when amber was rubbed it acquired the ability to pick up light abjects, such as straw, dry grass, and the like. He also experimented with the lode- stone and knew of its power to attract iron. He apparently associated the two phenomena, although more than twenty- four hundred years elapsed before any actual relationship was proved. We do not know whether Thales discovered these facts for himself or learned of them from the Egyp- tian priests or from others. He apparently did not know of the directive power of the lodestone. It is from the Greek that our terms electricity and magne- tism are derived; the Greek word for amber is EXEKT~OU (elektron), and the word magnet is thought to have corne from Magnesia, a district in Thessaly, in which lodestones were found. According to Pliny, however, the word is de- rived from Magnes, the name of a shepherd who observed that the iron on the end of his crook was attracted by certain stones on Mount Ida that proved to be lodestones. ANCIENT AND MEDIEVAL RECORDS AFTER THALES The earliest written record that mentions the electrical prop- erties of amber came from Theophrastus (about 300 B.C.). Later, various other Greek and Roman writers alluded both to the electrical properties of amber and the magnetic prop- erties of the lodestone. Pliny the elder (23-79 A.D.), a Roman naturalist whose untimely death occurred on the seashore at Retina not far from Pompeii, in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, referred to the attractive powers of amber several times in his Natural History. He wrote that"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"the Etruscans, about 600 B.C., were ablc to draw lightning from the clouds and to turn it aside. We learn from others that the Temple of Solomon may bave been protected from lightning hy nurnerous Sharp points of metal that covered the roof and that were connected by means of pipes to çaverns in a hill. The temple of Juno is said to bave been similarly protected. Lucretius, the poet and author of De Rerum Natura, noted the ability of the lodestone to attract several iron rings, onc adhering to the other, and marveled at the peculiar behavior of iron filings in a brass bowl when a magnet was moved ahout heneath,it. As the gxat Roman Empire declined, the culture of Greece and Rome gradually vanished; Learning almost dis- appeared and for centuries was confined largely to the monks and prie& ib the Christian çhurch. After the rise of Islam, in the early part of the seventh Century, there was a great upsurge in learning among the Arab peoples, who, even though they destroyed the library at Alexandria, trans- lated the works of the great pagan philosophas. Arab cul- ture flourished during the Dark Ages when Western learning was at low ebb, where it remained until the beginning of the Renaissance. There is an interesting item from Chinese history during the early part of our era. Koupho (295-324 A.D.), a dis- tinguished Chinese naturalist, compared the attractive power of the magnet with the ability of excited amber to attract mustard seeds. From his mariner of writing, it ap- pears that this property of amber was no new discovq, but it is tbe first time the phenomenon was mentioned in Chinese history. During the Middle Ages the properties of amber and the lodestone were not forgotten, but no new knowledge was added. St. Augustine in 426 A . D . expressed wonder at the"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"6 Chapter One ability of the lodestone to hold several iron rings suspended from it, and he mentioned an experiment in which a bit of iron laid on a silver plate is made to follow the movements of a magnet beneath the plate. That long and dismal period of European history, gener- ally called the Dark Ages, or the Middle Ages, came to an end sometime during the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries. In the world of science there may be some disagreement as to who was the first real scientist in the revival of learning, but surely Albertus Magnus (1206?-1280) was among the earliest. He taught at the University of Paris, where he was a distinguished professor of theology and philosophy and was also among the most learned in the science of the day. Also at the University of Paris at the same time was Roger Bacon (1214?-1294), who had first studied at Oxford. He became well versed in the scientific works of the Greek philoso- phers and the Arab scholars. It was Roger Bacon, more than anyone of his time, who insisted that human progress de- pended upon research and scientific education. His re- searches carried him into the fields of alchemy, medicine, optics, and mathematics. He is sometimes credited with the invention of the telescope and of gunpowder, although the former is generally ascribed to Lippershey of Middleburg, Holland and the latter to Berthold Schwartz. In Roger Bacon’s greatest work, his Opus Mujus (1268), he reversed the manner of thinking of the Greek philosophers, which was largely subjective, to reasoning based on experi- ment. His writings and experiments, however, got him into trouble with the Church and he was accused of practicing black magie. He had become a Franciscan monk upon his return to England in 1250 but was soon enjoined by his order from writing or teaching and thereupon returned to Paris, where later the ban was lifted by a new pope."},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"THE MAGNETIC COhtPASS One of Koger BacOn’s teachers was Petrus Peregrinus, or Pierre de Maricourt, who had carricd on numerous experi- nxmls in rnagnetism. Petrus Peregrinus M-as net only a teachcr but also a soldier attached LO ~he engineer corps of the Frencb army. During thc year 1269, while he wa with the armies of Charles of Anjou, which were besieging Lucera in southern Italy: he wrote a lengthy lelkr from bis camp to a friend named Sigerus de Foucancour~, at his old home in Picardy. ‘Thc letter described in detail bis experi- ments with magnetü, lhe construction of a floating com- pas, and also a pivoted compas employing a steel ncedlc. This compas was provided with a tard net unlike the mari- ner’s compass of today. An excellent translation of Pere- griuus’s Ieller has been made by Professor Silvanus P. Thompson. The Italian historian Flavius Blondus writcs that Italian rnariners, sailing out of the harbor at Amalfi, used a floating magnet as a compas before 1269. Its invention was attrib- uted to a fiçtitions person named Flavio Gioia of Amalfi. Therr is an inconsistençy, however, in this account because the alleged invention oçcurred in 1302. Blondus asserts that the real origirr of the magnetic compass is unknown. There seems to be litlle doubt that thr Italiaos learned about lbe compas from the Arabs. The magnetic compas wâs the first device having practical value that came from experiments with magnetism. After the tirne of Petrus Peregrinus the compas soon carne into general use and led to many theories as tu the rasons for its behavior. Its variations in diffcrcnl longitudes were noted, togçther with other changes of short duration. IJn- doubtedly the voyages of Columbus and Vasço da Gama were greatly aided by its use."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"8 Chapter One With the invention or rediscovery of the compass came a greatly increased interest in magnetism. Many believed that magnetism was a cure for various diseases, and others claimed to be able to use compass needles, separated by great distances, as a means of telegraphic communication. Still others, among whom was Petrus Peregrinus, claimed to have made perpetual motion machines using magnets. Robert Norman of Wapping, England, a maker of compass needles, was the first to make a dipping needle. He found the inclination of the needle at London to be 71 degrees, 50 minutes. During the Renaissance epoch human progress was more rapid than at any earlier period. It was far more than a rebirth of the classical learning of Greece and Rome. Not only did art and literature flourish, but great new lands were discovered; printing, gunpowder, and the telescope were invented; and Copernicus gave the world a new con- cept of the universe. The Church was shaken, and auto- cratic government began to lose its despotic power. There was, however, little further progress in the science of elec- tricity and magnetism until about the year 1600. WILLIAM GILBERT William Gilbert was born at Colchester in England in 1544. He studied medicine at St. John% College, Cambridge. After graduation he traveled about Europe for a time and re- turned to London in 1573, where he practiced medicine very successfully. At the same time he carried forward a series of experiments in electricity and magnetism and also studied a11 of the available writings of others on the subject. Gilbert devoted seventeen years of his life to compiling the results of his researches into a Latin volume entitled De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"Figure 1.1 William Gilbert Demonstrates Electrostatic Attraction at the Court of Queen Elizabeth (Courtesy Burndy Library) Tellure;Physiologia Noua, Pluribus et Argumentes et Expr- imentis Lkmonstrata.

From his experiments in magnetism Gilbert deduced many ideas concerning the magnetic field, magnetic induction, polarity, and tbe effects of tempera- turc on magnets.

Gilbert’s ski11 as a physician and his genius as a scientist were recognized by Queen Elizabeth, who appointed him as her court physician in 1601. He died in 1603. Gilbert has been honored by the use of his name as the unit of magnetomotive force. In his De Magnete, Gilbert reiterated the plea of Roger Bacon for more intensive re- search. By a queer coincidence another Bacon, this time Sir Francis Bacon, who followed soon after Gilbert, pub- lished in 1620 a great work of science entitled Nouum Or- ganum. As far as we know, Sir Francis Bacon never carried on any original scientific research, but he set forth the sci- entific achievements up to his time SO clearly and presented the case for research SO eloquently that the book was, and still is, a source of inspiration for scientists."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"I 2 Electrical Machines and Experiments with Static Electricity Sçientific progress during thc later years of thç sixteenth and throughout the seventeentb Century was astonishing. Among the great names of science of that period were Co- pernicus, Gilbert, Brahc, Napier, Francis Bacon, Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, van Gueriçke. Torriçelli, Hoyle, Iluygens, Mariotte, R’ewton, and Leibniz. During this period Aso, the first experiments on the steam engine wcre made by de Caus, Papi”, and Savery. These experiments were carried to suçcessful conclusions in the eighteenth Century by New- comen and Watt. It is only fitting that in this recital of grcat men of science, special mention be made of Sir Isaac Newton, who is re- garded by many as thc greatest of scient&. His contribu- tions to human knowledge were largely in the fields of rnathematics, optics, astronomy, and in tbe laws of mechan- ics and gravitation. H C made sornc miner experiments in electricity also, but his importance in this history lies prin- cipally in the effeçt of his work on research. His Principin was the third great scientific work published in England in the seventeenth century. OTTO VON GIJERICKE In electriçnl science there was again a considcrable lapse of time alter Gilbert’s De Magnete until Otto van Gueriçke, the burgomaster of Magdeburg, constructed the first elec- trical machine in 1660. Von Guericke is also distinguished as the invcntor of the air pomp and as the one who deviscd the spectaçuhw Magdeburg hemispheres experiment."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"12 Chapter Two F@ure 2.1 Von Guericke’s Electrical Machine (From Bumdy Library) Von Guericke’s electrical machine marked the most sub- stantial advance yet made in electrical knowledge. In this machine a sulfur bal1 that had been cast in a glass globe was mounted on a shaft which passed through its tenter. The bal1 was rotated by means of a crank at the end of the shaft. In later models the shaft was driven at higher speed by means of a belt that passed over a larger driving wheel and over a smaller pulley on the shaft carrying the sulfur bah. The rotating bal1 was excited by friction through the application of the dry hands or a cloth. This machine produced far greater quantities of electricity than had hitherto been available and made possible new and interesting experiments. Von Guericke noted the attraction"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"and repulsion of feathers, the crackling noises and sparks, and the odor that pernreated the air when the machine was excited. He found also that the electrification of the bal1 produced a tingling sensation when any part of the body approached it. There is reason to believe that van Guericke noted that electricity from his machine could be trans- mitted several feet over a piece of string. These experiments were witnessed by many persons with lively interest, and news of the device soon spread to all parts of Europe. Within a short time similar machines with variations and improvements were constructed by others. Sir Isaac New- ton became interested in the experiments and is credited with the construction of an electrical machine hsving a glass globe about the year 1675. OT\"ER EXPERIMENTS WITH STATIC ELECTRICITY Jean Picard, a French sstronomer, noted in 1675 that when a Torricellian barometer was agitated in thc dark, flashes of light appeared in the evacuated space above the merçq. The mercury barometer was invented by Evangelista Ton% celli of Italy in 1643. It consisted of a vertical glass tube closed at one end and filled with mercury. When the mer- cury-filled tube was inverted with the open end below the surface of the mercury in a cup, the level of the rnercury in the tube dropped to a point at which it was sustained by atmospheric pressure, leaving a vacuum in the tube above the mercury. Francis Hawksbee pondered this phenomenon and in 1705 carried on a series of experiments to determine the cause of this light. He used glass vessels containing mercury, some of whicb had been exhausted while others had net. Wben the vessels were shaken, the light appeared in the evacuated vessels but only faintly in those containing air. Thc appearancc of tbe light was also different in the"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"14 Chapter Two exhausted vessels from that in the vessels containing air. In the vacuum the light was in the nature of a glow that per- meated the evacuated space, whereas in the vessels con- taining air the light appeared as weak flashes. Hawksbee discovered that similar effects could be pro- duced on glass vessels,without mercury simply by rubbing the exterior surfaces, and thereby proved the electrical na- ture of the phenomenon. He also showed that an evacuated glass globe could be made to glow by bringing it near an- other globe that had been electrified by rubbing. He per- formed many beautiful experiments showing colors and striations with varying degrees of evacuation and various shapes of glass vessels. He may have noted the similarity between these effects and the aurora borealis. Following these experiments, Hawksbee proceeded to build electrical machines using revolving glass globes. Some of his machines were powerful and produced sparks of considerable inten- sity. Among other experimenters was Professor Johann Hein- rich Winckler of the University of Leipzig who, about the year 1733, substituted a fixed cushion for the hand or cloths which had previously been used as rubbers. Georg Matthias Boze (1710-1761) of Wittenberg about 1745 added a prime conductor, with which greater quantities of electricity could be collected. At Erfurt a Scottish monk named Gordon constructed a machine using a glass cylinder rather than the previously common glass globe. About the year 1670, Robert Boyle, whose chief fame rests on his work with gases, made some additions to Gil- bert’s list of substances that could be electrified and also found that the attractions between electrified and nonelec- trified bodies were mutual. In the Philosophical Transac- tions in 1708, Dr. William Wall published his observations"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"on the sparks and crackling noises emanating frorn electri- fied bodies, which he compared with lightning and thunder. Winckler made similar observations sornewhat later, and suggested the use of conductors for protection against lightning. STEPHEN GRAY ANI) 'THE TRANSMISSIOX OF ELECTRICITY Stephen Gray (16Y5-1736), a pensioner at Charter House in London, some time prior to 1728 began a series of elcc- trical experiments with very lirnited equipment. His carlier experiments were of a miner nature, which included the disçovery of the electrification by warming and rubhing of such materials as feathcrs, hair, silk, linen, wool, cloth, paper, leather, wood, parchrncnt, and goldheaters skin. Ile found also that lincn and papa could he made to give off light in the dark. His most notable discovery, however, was that electricity could be transmitted. In 172Y he had made many fruitless efforts to electrify met& by the same methods he had uscd on other materials when it occurred to him that perhaps he could transfer a charge frorrr an electrified glass tube to a piece of metal. He used for this purpose a glass tuhe l’/~ inches in diarneter and 3 feet, 5 incbes long. A Cork had been fitted into each end of the tube to keep out the dust. He tried first ta determine whether or net there was any appreciable difference in the electrification of the tube with and without the corks and found none. He did find, how- ever, that when the tuhe was electrified the Cork would attract and repel a feather. In his next experiment he attached an ivory bal1 to the end of a fir stick about four inches long and inserted the other end of the stick in the Cork. When the tube was"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"16 Chapter Two rubbed, he found that the bal1 was electrified as the cork had been. Carrying the experiment further, he attached the bal1 to longer sticks and to brass and iron rods, with similar results. As the sticks and metal rods became longer, he experi- enced difficulty due to bending, and he conceived the idea of using a piece of packthread or string attached to the cork and to the ivory ball. With the longest packthread he could manage by suspending the bal1 over the edge of a balcony he was still able to transmit electrical charges to the ball. He then tried suspending a longer packthread over a nail in a beam to the ivory ball, but this time the experiment failed. He surmised correctly that the charge had been led off through the nail into the beam. On June 30, 1729, Gray visited Granville Wheeler in the country to demonstrate his experiments. Together they worked to transmit the electrical charges over the greatest possible distance. Mr. Wheeler suggested suspending the packthread on silk threads, and this arrangement worked admirably. They had transmitted the charge over 80 feet of packthread. In order to increase the distance still further, they looped the packthread back through the same gallery, a total distance of 147 feet. In further experiments they finally reached a distance of 765 feet. In still other experi- ments they discovered that hair, rosin, and glass made suit- able supports for their packthread line. On the same day, which was July 2, 1729, Gray and Wheeler electrified larger surfaces such as a map and a tablecloth. In August of the same year, Gray found that he could produce charges at the end of an insulated packthread line merely by bringing the electrified glass tube near the other end of the line without touching it and that the electrifica- tion was greatest at the far end of the line."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"Gray made another notable discovery in which he found that an iron rod, pointed at both ends and suspended from silk lines, gave off cones of light in the dark when it was approached by an electrified glass tube. He also commented on the similarity between electrical sparks with the noises they produced and flashes of lightning with peals of thun- der. No better example of the value of rescarch and obser- vation may be found than in Gray’s experiments with sim- ple apparatus and an inquiring mind. Gray made the important discovery in 1729 that some substances were conductors and others were nonconduc- tors. He may bave been the first to use wires as conductors. The art of wiredrawing was not discovered until the four- teenth Century and did not reach England until thc seven- teentb century, SO that in the time of Gray, wire was still a comparatively new item. DU FAY'S EXPERIMENTS AND 141s DISCOVERY OF TWO KINDS OF ELECTRICITY In Paris Charles Du Fay (169%I73Y), a retired military officer and a member of the French Academy of Sciences, reported the results of his experirnents to tbe Academy during the years 1733 and 1734. H C disproved the state- ment by Jean Desaguliers that all bodies could be classified as electrics or nonelectrics by showing that ail bodies could be electrified. In the case of conductors it was necessary that they be insulated. IIe showed that a string was a better conductor when it was wet and succeeded in conduçting electricity over such a line a distance of 1256 feet. Among his other interesting experiments was the electrification of the human body when il was insulated from the ground. He noted that when another person approached the one who was electrified, he experienced a prickling sensation, and in"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"18 Chapter Two a dark room there was an emission of sparks. Du Fay rediscovered an effect which had been observed by von Guericke, namely, that a charged body attracts another body, which after contact receives a similar charge and is then repelled. Du Fay’s most important discovery, however, was that there were two kinds of electricity, which he called vitreous and resinous. The first, he said, was produced on glass, rock crystal, precious stones; hair of animais, and wool. The second was produced on amber, copal, gum-lac, thread, and paper. He announced also that these electricities repel simi- lar charges and attract opposite kinds. IMPROVEMENTS IN ELECTRICAL MACHINES In 1746 Dr. Ingenhousz made a glass plate machine, but the same invention has also been attributed to Jesse Ramsden, although this was not until 1768. Benjamin Wilson about 1746 invented a collecter for an electrical machine some- what resembling a comb. It consisted of a metallic rod with a number of fine points, SO mounted that the points were close to the revolving electrified surface. THE LEYDEN JAR A very important discovery was made on November 4, 1745 by E. G. von Kleist of Kammin, Pomerania, Germany, which was first credited to Professor Pieter van Musschen- broek and his assistant Cunaeus of Leyden, Holland, but priority belongs to von Kleist. Nevertheless, the invention has since been known as the Leyden jar. It was found that a bottle partly filled with water and containing a metal rod which projected through the neck would, when held in the hand and the rod presented to an electrical machine, receive"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"a powerful charge. S O great was the charge that after the bottle was removed from the electrical machine the person holding the bottle would reçeive a severe shock when a finger of the free hand touched the central rod. The news of this discovery spread SO rapidly through Europe that within a very short time it had been repeated everywhere, and some individu& traveled throughout the continent demonstraling the new discovery, and gaining a good livelihood thereby. In England Sir William Watson showed the Leyden jar to Dr. Uevis, a colleague, wbo sug- gested coating the outside with sheet lead or tin foi1 to replace the human hand. Another experimenter, John Smeaton, applied tin foi1 to both sides of a pane of glass and obtained excellent results, whrreupon Watson coated both the inside and the outside of several large glass jars with leaf silver arrd succeeded in storing powerful charges. THE SPEED OF ELECTKICITY ‘The Leyde” jar provided a new and useful tool for carrying on electrical research, especially experiments in the trans- mission of electricity. By this time the use of wires as con- ductors was commcmplace. In France electricity from charged Leyden jars was transmittcd a distance of 2% miles. Pierre Charles Lemmonier, the French astronomer, at- tempted to measure the velocity of electricity but fond that the time required to travel a distance of 5700 feet was inappreciable. In England Sir \\Villiam Watson, together with Henry Cavendish, Dr. Ilevis, and others, conducted similar experiments using the ground as one side of the circuit. Baked or dried sticks were used as supports for the wires. On August 5, 1748, at Shooters Hill, these men set up a cir- cuit of 12,276 feet through which they discharged a Leyden jar and decided that transmission was instantaneous."},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"20 Chapter Two SIR WILLIAM WATSON3 THEORIES In another experiment, Watson observed that bodies un- equally charged with the same kind of electricity tend to equalize their charges when they are joined. Watson was also the first to apply the terms plus and minus to electrical polarities; therefore, he may have shared Franklin’s view that there was, in fact, only one kind of electricity and that there appeared to be two kinds due to a relative excess or deficiency. Watson was the author of several books on elec- tricity, one of which, published in 1746, entitled Nature ad Properties of Electricity, first aroused Franklin’s in- terest in the subject. MISCELLANEOUS DISCOVERIES Probably the first attempt to use electricity for telegraphic purposes over long circuits was made by Johann Heinrich Winckler of the University of Leipzig in 1746. In some of his experiments he used the river Pleisse for a portion of the return circuit. Following the work of Gray and Du Fay on the transmission of electricity, the idea of using electricity for telegraphic purposes occurred to a number of men. Be- fore the discovery of voltaic electricity and electromagne- tism the kinds of signais were limited in number. Winckler probably used sparks. Pierre Lemonnier of France discovered that the quantity of electricity communicated to a body is not in proportion to its volume but in proportion to its surface. He also dis- covered that the shape of a body influenced its ability to receive a charge. The Abbé Nollet (J ean Antoine 1700-1770), who was the friend and co-worker of Du Fay, made numerous discov- eries and observations. He found that when an uninsulated body was introduced into an electrical field of influence it"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Experimenls with Statk Klectricity 21 became electrified. This effect had also been noted hy Gray. Nollet observed that when sbarp points were brought into such a ficld, the sharpest were first to give off brushes of light. He may also have been the inventer of an electro- scope consisting of two threads attached to a conductor, which diverged when electrified. ‘The Abbé also performed numerous experiments on the influence of electricity on the flow of liquids from capillary tubes. Nollet called attention to the similarity between elec- tricity and lightning, as Dr. Wall, Stephen Gray, Winckler, and others had done. There had heen little interest in magnetism since the time of Gilbert, but there was one new development. Knight and Michel1 in England, and Duhamel in France, during the years 1745 ta 1750, had constructed several powerful steel magnets by new processes of heat treatment and by the use of a number of smsller bars to build up a single larger magnet. The principal source of magnetism, however, was still the lodestone, except that some rather weak magnets had been made by striking steel bars held in the magnetic meridian. The discovery had been made about this time that a cor- rent of air issued from an electrified point at the same time that such a point gave forth a brush discharge. Hamilton of Dublin used tbis discovery to construct the first electrically operated motor, wbich consisted of a wire stuck through a Cork with the pointed ends bent in opposite directions. The axis was a needle that was suspended from a magnet SO that it could turn almost without friction. When the points were electrified the device rotated SO long as the electrification continued. Benjamin Wilson made a somewhat similar device, except that he provided vanes on thç Cork set in motion by a"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"22 Chapter Two stream of air issuing from an electrified point placed just outside them. Hawksbee, Nollet, and others had observed the similarity between electrical discharges in a vacuum and the aurora borealis. Perh Vilhelm Margentin, secretary of the Swedish Academy of Sciences, addressed a letter to the Royal Soci- ety, dated February 21, 1750, in which he mentions his observations concerning the effect of the aurora borealis on the magnetic needle. If, as some believed, the aurora bore- alis was an electrical phenomenon, this discovery by Mar- gentin established a relationship between electricity and magnetism. The discovery had also been made that pieces of steel that had been struck by lightning were sometimes magnetized. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN3 EXPERIMENTS Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790) of Philadelphia was the first American who made a notable contribution to elec- trical science. His fame in science rests chiefly on his dem- onstration that lightning was an electrical discharge, but this discovery had been anticipated by others, both in theory and in experiment. His well-known kite experiment was performed in June 1752, during a thunderstorm in a field at the outskirts of Philadelphia. He succeeded in charging a Leyden jar from the kite string as it began to rain and a heavy thundercloud passed over. Franklin had written at some length concerning his theo- ries regarding lightning and his proposed methods of prov- ing them. These writings were published abroad before he was able to perform his experiment, with the result that others were soon engaged in similar endeavors. In France, Dalibard and Delor proved the electrical nature of lightning"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"Figure 2.2 Benjamin Franklin (Iirom Smithsonian InstitutionJ"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"24 Chapter Two about a month before Franklin’s kite experiment, by means of elevated rods from which Leyden jars were charged. Canton and Wilson, in England, carried on similar experi- ments with good results, and in St. Petersburg, Professor Richmann was killed by lightning while experimenting with an elevated rod during a thunderstorm. Other experiments performed by Franklin were probably of greater lasting importance. He began his work in elec- tricity in 1746, at which time he had purchased some simple pieces of equipment after reading a book on the subject by William Watson. Perhaps his earliest discovery was the fact that when a piece of glass was rubbed with a cloth, the glass received a charge of the same strength as the charge on the cloth but opposite in kind. He concluded that a11 bodies contain electricity, and that when two dis- similar substances are rubbed together the one receives an excess of electricity and the other a deficiency. From this supposition he reasoned further that there was but one kind of electricity rather than two, as Du Fay and others had supposed. Dr. Watson in England may have corne to the same conclusion when he spoke of plus and minus electric- ity, terms that were very similar to Franklin’s positive and negative. Franklin demonstrated his theory concerning a single kind of electricity by having two people stand on insulated plat- forms, one of whom rubbed a glass tube with a cloth and took the charge from the cloth, while the other took the charge from the glass. When they brought their fingers close together a strong spark passed between them and both were completely discharged, showing that the charges had neu- tralized each other. Another demonstration of the same principle was made by hanging a Cork bal1 between two knobs connected to the inner and outer linings of a Leyden"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"jar. The hall would vibrate between the two knobs until the Leyden jar was eompletely discharged and hoth coatings wcre neutral with respect to the earth. When a Leyden jar is charged, thc outer coating must be connected to ground or to some other eyuivalent body. Franklin showed that the inner coating Will receive only as much electricity as is driven from the outer ooe. He notcd that a linen thread, suspended near the outer coating, was unaffected until the eyuilibrium was disturbed by bringing a finger ncar the knob connected to the inter coating. Franklin showed also that, apparently, the charge held by a Leyden jar was on the glass and not in the coatings. He demonstrated this theory with a jar in which water formed tbe inner coating. When the water was poured off, he found that tbe water was not charged. Upon filling the jar with fresb water he was able to discharge it. Franklin performed similar expetiments using glass plates with removable coat- ings. Later research has shown that although the facts of the experiment werc correct, the interpretation is slightly different. It is now known that the charge is of the nature of a strain in the dielectric. In 1748, Franklin descrihed an electrostatic jack, or mo- tor. H C attached two metal knobs to diametrically opposite sides of an insulating wheel and placed tbe wheel SO that it would rotate between two stationary insulated knobs, with a vcry small clearance between the rotatiog and stationary oncs. When the stationary knohs wcre electrified, onc posi- tively and the otber ncgatively, the wheel was caused to rotate. The knobs on the wheel were fiat attracted, and as they approached tbe stationary knohs a spark passed, making the charge on both of the samc sign. The result was that they repelled one another and caused the wheel to rotate."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"26 Chapter Two ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY On April 12, 1753, F ranklin succeeded in causing an alarm bel1 to ring by means of atmospheric electricity. He had installed an insulated iron rod at his house, which projected some distance into the air. The rod was connected to a device in which there were two bells, with a lightly hung, insulated clapper between them. One of the two bells was connected to the elevated rod and the other to ground. When the rod became sufficiently electrified, the clapper was attracted first to one bel1 and then to the other. The elevated rod served for various other experiments in- volving atmospheric electricity. He found that the charge on a cloud might be either positive or negative and that a cloud could change the polarity of its charge. Franklin ob- served strong electrification of the atmosphere during a snowstorm and even when the sky was entirely clear. In another series of experiments, Franklin became inter- ested in the nature of the electric field surrounding a charged body. In order to visualize the shape of the field, he suspended electrified bodies in still air, and then filled the air with smoke from rosin, which he had dropped on hot plates. The smoke, much to his amazement and gratifi- cation, formed beautiful patterns about the charged body. Franklin had a friend at Boston, a Mr. Kinnersley, who was also interested in electricity. They corresponded fre- quently concerning their experiments. Kinnersley redis- covered Du Fay’s findings concerning two kinds of elec- tricity by the use of two electrical machines, one with a sulfur ball, and the other with a glass globe. Neither of the two men knew of Du Fay’s work. Franklin repeated Kinnersley’s experiment, and observed that the sparks from the glass and sulfur balls were different in appearance. The brush discharge from the prime conductor of the glass globe"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"machine was large, long, and divergent, and made a snap- ping noise, whilc that from the sulfur machine was short, small, and made a hissing noise. Kinnersley also experi- mented with tbe thermal effects of electricity, and by using a battery of Leyden jars he succeeded in melting fine iron wires. For his many achievements in electrical science, Franklin was awarded the Copley Medal, Enghmd’s greatest scientific award, hy tbe Royal Society of London in 1753. EXPEKIMENTS IN EUROPE WlTH ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICI'I'Y Lemonnier, the Abbé Mazeas, and Beccaria, during the years 1752 and 17.53, performed many experiments on atmospheric electricity using botb kites and elevated rods. ‘They found evidences of electrification at most tirnes, but especially when them were thunderclouds in the sky. Usu- ally there was Little electrification at night, but it increased grcatly after sunrise and diminisbed after son&. Canton discovered tbat the air in a room could be electri- fied, as did Heccaria also. Canton showed that the air in a zoom acquired the same kind of electricity as a charged body in that room and that the divergence of two threads attached to the charged body gradually decreased as tbe air became electrified, even though the charge on the body was maintained hy an electrical machine. Beccaria produced sparks under water and noted tbe formation of buhbles accompanying the sparks hut did not suspect that the bub- hles were due to the decolrlposition of the water ELECTRICAL INDUCTION Elwtrical induction is the phenomenon in which a body becomes electrified when it is approached hy another body"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"28 Chapter Two carrying an electrical charge. Its effects had been noted by Hawksbee, Stephen Gray, Nollet, and probably by many others. It was now under investigation by Franklin, Wilke, Canton, and Aepinus. Experiments had shown that when a charged body was brought near an insulated conductor, a charge similar in kind to that of the charged body appeared at the remote end of the insulated conductor (repelled charge), and that if this charge were led off to ground and the original charged body removed, there remained on the insulated conductor a charge (bound charge) of sign oppo- site to the original one. Stephen Gray had in part discov- ered similar effects with his packthread line but had not observed the relationship of kinds, nor that there were two distinct induced charges. The discovery of inductive effects led to the invention of the electrophorus in 1775 by Ales- sandro Volta. It consisted of a flat metallic disk, or shallow pan, which was covered with sealing wax or rosin and pro- vided with a removable disk of metal, of slightly smaller size, having an insulating handle at the tenter. When the sealing wax or rosin was electrified by rubbing with a cat- skin and the removable disk was brought down near the surface of the charged electrophorus, induced charges were produced in the disk. By touching the finger to the remov- able disk before it was lifted, the repelled charge was led off, after which the finger was removed and the disk lifted, which then had on it a free charge. The electrophorus was a useful instrument, because it provided rather large quanti- ties of electricity with little effort. ELECTROSCOPES The Reverend Abraham Bennet described in the Philosoph- id Transactions for 1787 two inventions of great impor- tance. One was the gold leaf electroscope that, with subse-"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Figure 2.3 Coulomb’s Torsion Balance (Courtey Burndy Library)"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"30 Chapter Two quent improvements by William Hasledine Pepys, became the most sensitive detector of electricity, and the other was his electric doubler, a device that by induction was capable of building up a small charge to a large one. In connection with the gold leaf electroscope, mention should be made at this time of the various other electro- scopes and electrometers which came into use. The earliest was probably Gilbert’s versorium, a pivoted needle. Von Guericke, Stephen Gray, and others had used feathers to indicate electrification. Nollct, Beccaria, and Franklin used two threads hung close together, which separated when electrified. It is not clear who invented the pith bal1 electro- scope, but such instruments were in use by the middle of the eighteenth Century. Daniel Gralath, of Danzig, about this time, had constructed an electrical balance. William T. Henley, in 1772, invented the quadrant electrometer, using a pith bal1 suspended at the tenter of a graduated arc. By far the most important device of this kind was the torsion balance, invented about the year 1784 by Charles Augustin de Coulomb (1736-1807). John Michell, whose name was mentioned previously in connection with mag- nets, had described a torsion balance earlier which Caven- dish used to determine the mean density of the earth. Coulomb used the instrument to prove the inverse squares laws governing electric and magnetic fields. This law had been announced for magnetic fields by Johann Tobias Mayer at Gottingen in 1760, and for electrical fields by Cavendish in 1762, but in each case with only partial proof. Coulomb demonstrated with great accuracy that the force between two magnetic poles is proportional to the product of the pole strengths and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, and that the force between two electrical charges is proportional to their prod-"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"uçt and inversely proportional to the.square of the distance between them. These laws are expressed in later terms by the equations f = mm’/($) and f = qq’/(K?), in which fis thç force, m and m’ are thr magnetic polc strengths, p (the Greek letter mu) is the permeability of the interven- ing medium, r is the distance between the magnetic poles or electrical charges, q and q’ are the electrical charges, and K is thç dielectric constant. Coulomb’s use of the torsion balance marked the begin- ning of quantitative work in electricity and magnetism. Coulomb also devised a magnetometer for measuring the intcnsity of the earth’s rnagnetic field. Charles Borda, a E‘rencb astronomcr, had made certain magnrtic measure- ments with some success in 1776, and still carlier George Graharn had suggested methods of measurement but had net carried them out. OTHEK DISCOVERIES IN ‘~LIE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY During the closing years of tha eighteenth Century there were many discoveries of varying degrees of importance. Georg Christoph Lichtenberg, professor of experimental philosophy at Gottingen notrd in 1777 that when fine powders, such as lycopodium spores, were electrified and dusted upon surfaces electrified with the opposite kind of electricity, the particles arranged themselves in beautiful configurations. The positively charged powders showed fig- ures resembling feathers, while thosc negatively electrified arrangcd themselves in starlike figures. Thcse are known as Lichtenberg figures and are at present produced more clearly on photographie plates. In 1781 Lavoisier, the gxat French chemist, showed that electrification was produced when solids or liquids were"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"32 Chapter Two converted into gases or when gases were released during effervescence caused by chemical action. Martin Van Marum, of Holland, about 1785 constructed the most powerful frictional electrical machine built up to that time. It was a plate machine, having two circular glass plates 65 inches in diameter, each of which was excited by four rubbers. S O powerful was this machine that a pointed conductor at a distance of 28 feet showed a brush dis- charge. Van Marum also constructed a battery of Leyden jars with a total surface of 225 square feet. The discharge from this battery magnetized steel bars l/iz inch by 1 inch in cross section and 9 inches long. The magnetic properties of cobalt and the diamagnetic properties of bismuth and antimony were discovered in 1778 by Sebald Justin Brugmans of Holland. A diamagnetic substance is one that has a permeability in air or in a vac- uum of less than one. A bar or needle of such a substance when free to move would tend to take a position at right angles to the lines of force in a magnetic field. Before concluding the portion of this history preceding the epochal discovery of the voltaic cell, mention must be made of Joseph Priestley (1733-1804).

This book of 736 pages was published in 1767, and notwithstanding the fact that electrical science had scarcely been born at this time the book is still well worth reading.

The long list of experimenters, already mcntioned, had transformed electrical knowledge from a natural curi- osity into a science.

Up to that time a11 known electrical phenomena originated solely from electri- cal charges produced by friction, heat, or induction, and currents of electricity were of a transitory nature, resulting from the discharges of accumulated electrical charges. In the period now under consideration, new contrivances were discovered which were capable of producing, by chem- ical means, steady currents of electricity. The quantities of electricity available from the various electrical machines previously in use were minute, and therefore the chemical, heating, and magnetic effects were difficult to observe, al- though a11 of them, as a matter of fact, had been noted. On numerous occasions, important electrical discoveries had been made without recognition of their value, and only after one or more rediscoveries of such phenomena did they lead to new advances. Such was the case in the discoveries made by Galvani and Volta. In 1700, Joseph, a Frenchman, and Caldani, an Italian, had noted the contractions of the muscles of a frog under the influence of electrical discharges. In 1752 Swammer- dam, a Dutch physicist, published his account of an experi- ment in which a muscle was made to contract when touched at two points, one of which was a nerve, with the free ends of a silver and copper couple, the other ends of which were joined. Johann Georg Sulzer, of Switzerland, published in Berlin, in 1762, the discovery which showed that when unlike met-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"ais such as silver and lead were held together on the tangue, a taste like that of iron sulfate was produced, and when one was held on the tangue and the other below it, there was no sensation until the outer edges of the met& came in con- I tact. GALVANI’S FROG EXPERIMENTS Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), professor of anatomy at the Llniversity of tlologna, was not ordy a skilled anatomist but he was also familiar with chernical and physical sciences. During the year 1780, while he was dissecting a frog in his laboratory hefore a group of people including his wife Lucia (daughter of Domeniço Galeazzi, Galvani’s professor of anatomy) and Giovanni Aldini, his nephew, Galvani laid the frog on the table near an electrical machine that was being used at the time in performing electrical experiments. It was noted that when tlrere was a spark, while at the same time a scalpel was held with its point at a nerve center, the legs of thc frog contracted. According to one version of the story, it was Galvani’s wife that called his attention to the unexpected happening. Galvarri bccame greatly interested in this rather astonish- ing phenomenon, especially sincc there was no direct con- nection between tbc machine and the scalpel or tbe frog. He did not attempt to explain the latter circumstance, but he recognizcd tbe fact that the contractions werc due to electricity. Galvnni tried various met&, other than the steel knife, with similar results. Ile also obtained the same results witb a charged Leyden jar, witb tbe electrophorus, and with atmospberic electricity.

Before the publication of bis experiments, however, others had tcarned of Gatvani’s discovery and re- peated them. VOLTA AND THE VOLTAIC PILE Among those who hecame interested in this matter was Atessandro Votta (1745-X27), professor of natural history at the University of Pavia, wbose name was mentioned pre- viousty in connection with the etectrophorus.

Other experimenters, however, went ta work immediately, and by October 1800 Sir Humphry Davy hsd proved that the electricity was due to chemical action and tbat the voltaic cell would not oper- ate with pure water. Ca&le and Nicholson diseovered the decomposition of water on May 2, 1800, using a voltaic pile. In Juty 1800, William Cruikshank decomposed salts by similar means. In November 1800, Volta went to Paris, wbere he lectured on galvanism and illustrated his lectures with erperirnents. Among other things he decomposed water with curent from his cetls. Nspoleon recognized the importance of Volta’s diseovery and awarded him a gotd medal, the cuxs of the Legion of Honor, and a prix of 6000 francs. EVOLUTION OF THE BATTERY AND DISCOVERIES WITH ELECTRIC CURRENTS In 1801 Johann Ritter developed the idea of a series of met& from which the relative electrical pressures pro- duced by various pairs when immersed in a sait or acid solution could be determined. Volta conceived the same idea independentty at a later date, and the series came to be known as Volta’s etectromotive series. These ideas indicated that the notion of electromotive force was already estab- lished, although a quarter of a Century was yet to elapse before the emmciation of Ohm’s law. Kew developments came with great rapidity, and Volta himself had scarcety dreamed of the immense field tbat his discovery had opened.

This battery produced very strong currents of electricity, with which it was possible to burn iron wires, heat charcoal to incandescence, and vaporize gold and silver leaf. The effects were, in many ways, much more powerful than those of the older electrical machines and Leyden jars, while in other ways the effects were not SO great and less spectacular. The batteries produced only small sparks and had little effect on the nervous system; they did, however, produce very great heating and chemical effects. Since the electricities of the voltaic cells, and the older electric ma- chines seemed totally unlike, the electricity obtained from the machines was for a time called common electricity while that of batteries was called voltaic electricity. Experiments with the new voltaic cells were carried for- ward in many places. Sir Humphry Davy (1778-1829), one of the most brilliant scientists of his age, in his first lecture at the British Royal Institution, delivered on April 25, 1801, discussed the history of galvanism. In a paper pre- sented in June of that year, he showed that galvanic action could be produced from plates of a single metal in different fluids, which were, however, in contact with each other. Nicholas Gautherot, in 1801, discovered that when a cur- rent of electricity from a voltaic battery was sent through two copper plates in sulfuric acid, for a short time these plates became capable of supplying a current in the oppo- site direction.

Several learned societies, among thcm the Koyal Socicty, appropti- ated funds for the construction of such batteries, sorne of which were huge things, weighing tons. William Haslcdine Pepys constructed several very large hat- teries for the Royal Socicty between the years 1802 and 1808, using copper and zinc plates in a nitric acid solution.

This great electroehçmical pile was built by the Royal Institution in London with funds provided by public subscription in 1813.

There were also batteries of great size at Paris and smaller ones at most of the universities of Europe. Nearly a11 of these batteries were constructed of the same simple elements, and they were a11 subject to the defect called polarization. Polarization refers to the collection of hydrogen gas bubbles on the positive electrode, causing the interna1 resistance of the ce11 to increase, and setting up a counter electromotive force, thereby diminishing the out- put. After Davy had proved the chemical nature of the voltaic ce11 and other experimenters had succeeded in decomposing water, there developed a great interest in the chemical action of the voltaic current. Berzelius of Gotland, Sweden, between the years 1802 and 1806, published a number of important papers on his electrochemical researches. These papers undoubtedly laid the foundation for the brilliant series of electrochemical discoveries by Davy. On November 20, 1806, Davy delivered his first Bakerian lecture before the Royal Society, on the subject, “On Some Chemical Agencies of Electricity,” and thereby provided the basis for the ionization theory. Then followed that not- able series of discoveries in which Davy isolated sodium and potassium in 1807 and barium, boron, calcium, and stron- tium in 1808. Funds for a powerful new battery for the Royal Institu- tion were subscribed in 1809. With this battery Davy sepa- rated the halogens, iodine, chlorine, and fluorine.

As early as 1812 he expressed the helief that magnetic fields were associated with electricity, but this statement was by no means a new doctrine, for electricity and magnetism had long been considered as having something in common, probably as far back as Thales. There was already much evidence that the two were related, such as the fact that pieces of steel had been magnetized by strokes of lightning and steel needles had been magnetized by discharges from electrical machines. Boze, in a letter to the Royal Society, stated that he had reversed polarities in a magnet and had destroyed magnetism by means of electricity. Beccaria had commented that the earth’s magnetism might be due to the circulation of the electric fluid about the earth. Franklin knew that lightning produced magnetic effects. Romagnosi, in 1802, had observed the deflection of a magnetic needle in the presence of a conductor carrying an electric current, but he seemed to have attached no impor- tance to his discovery at the time, and certainly no results came of it. Romagnosi himself made no claims to priority in the discovery of electromagnetism. In 1819, Oersted was lecturing before a science class where he demonstrated the heating effects of voltaic elec- tricity. During the demonstration he noted the oscillations of a nearby compass needle, which corresponded with the opening and closing of the electrical circuit. Oersted spent some months with further experiments on this phenome- non, using stronger batteries in order to obtain greater de- flections of the needle. He found that not only was a com- pass needle deflected by the electric current, but a wire"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"Figure 3.6 Oersted’s Diseovery (Courtesy Bumdy Librwy)"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"48 Chapter Three carrying a current of electricity, when free to move, was deflected by a magnet.

The effect on the scientific world was like that of von Guericke’s electric machine or von Kleist’s Leyden jar, for it was news of the greatest importance, and Oersted’s experiments were repeated by men of science everywhere. AMPÈRE André Marie Ampère (1775-1836) discovered that there were forces between two wires carrying electric currents. He supported a loop of wire with its terminals dipping into mercury cups. When a current of electricity was sent through this loop and an adjacent stationary loop, the sus- pended loop was deflected through an angle. Between Sep- tember 18 and November 2, 1820, Ampère delivered a series of lectures at the French Academy, describing new discoveries in electromagnetism. He defined the relationship between the direction of current flow and the deflection of a magnetic needle, and he showed that parallel conductors carrying currents in the same direction attracted each other, while those carrying currents in opposite directions were mutually repelled. He also constructed a lightly suspended helix of wire and showed that when an electric current passed through it, the helix behaved like a compass needle and like a magnet with respect to other magnets. He devel- oped the astatic needle, in which the effect of the earth’s magnetism is neutralized, advanced the theory that the magnetism of permanent magnets might be due to electric currents in their ultimate particles, and suggested that elec- tromagnetism might be used for telegraphy."},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"ARAGD, BIOT AND SAVART Arago discovered, in 1820, that a wire carrying a current of electricity would attract iron filings. lie and Ampère both discovered that a wire helix carrying an electriç curent was capable of magnetizing a soft iron bar around whiçh it was wound. In the same year Biot and Savart announced the law governing the force between a long straight conductor and a magnetic pale which is expressed by the equation H = 2i/r, in which H is the magnetic field strength, i is the current, and r is the perpendicular distance Crom the point of mea- surement to the conductor that caries the current. FARADAY'SROTATINGCONDUCTOR ANDMAGNETANDBARLOW'SWHEEL On September 3, 1821, Michael Faraday discovered tbat a conductor çarrying a curent would rotate about a magnetic pale and that a magnetized needle would rotate about a wire çarrying an electric current. For the first experiment, he used a metal cup containing mercury in thc tenter of which was a vertical bar magnet, one of whose pales pro- truded above the surface of the mercury. The conductor was lightly suspended above the cup, with the lower end dipping into the mercury. When a current was sent through the conductor, it revolved about the magnetic pale. For the second experiment, Faraday used substantially the same equipment except that the conductor was held in a fixed position, touching the mercury at the çenter of the cup, and the magnet was a magnetic needle, one end oî which was weighted with platinum, so that one pale restcd upon the bottom while the other end floated freely in the mercury, with the pale projecting above the surface of the mercury. $Vhen a cunent was sent through the conductor into the mercury, the magnetic needle rotated about the conductor."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"50 Chapter Three At about the same time Faraday discovered that a metal disk mounted on an axis through its tenter with its lower edge placed between the poles of a horseshoe magnet would revolve when a current passed between the axis and a trough of mercury into which the lower edge dipped. Peter Barlow had made a similar motor a little earlier, and the device was therefore called Barlow’s wheel. STURGEON’S ELECTROMAGNET Sturgeon is credited with making the first electromagnet in 1821, although Ampère and Arago had noted the magnetic fields of helices and their ability to magnetize soft iron. Professor Joseph Henry, of Albany, New York, was the first to make electromagnets with superimposed layers of insu- lated wire. His magnets were of high intensity and great lifting power. GALVANOMETERS Schweigger and Poggendorff, during the years 1820 and 1821, constructed the first crude galvanometers, using a wire helix and a compass needle. The earliest instrument of that type was called a multiplier, because the effect of a single wire on a compass needle was multiplied many times by the use of a helix. AMPÈRE3 AND OHM’S LAWS Except for Coulomb’s torsion balance, previous measuring instruments were scarcely more than indicators. Improve- ments were soon made in the Schweigger and Poggendorff galvanometers SO that they became measuring instruments of great accuracy. After Ampère published his fundamental law governing the relationship between an electrical circuit and a magnetic field, it became possible to use the galva-"},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"nometer for accurate measurements of electric currents. ‘This law, which was published in 1822, is as follows: f=i . m . dslr’,’ m which fis the force produced by a cur- rent i and a magnetic pale strength m; ds is an incremental length of conductor, which is perpendicular to the line join- ing the conductor and the magnetic pale and separated from it by a distance of r centimeters. From this law may be derived a definition of the absolute unit of current strength. Georg Simon Ohm (1787-1854) began his study of elec- trie currer~ts, flowing through conductors, in 1825. He pub- lished thc resutts of his studies in 1827, and in his papa, thc taw, which now bears his name, was presented for tbe first time.

His father, James Faraday, was a journeyman blacksmith. Michael’s formal education ended at the age of thirteen, at which time he took employment on a tria1 basis with a Mr. Riebau, a bookseller, in Bland- ford Street. After a year he became apprenticed to Mr. Riebau for a period of seven years. During his apprentice- ship, Faraday became a skilled bookbinder, and at the same time he developed an absorbing interest in the sciences, and particularly in chemistry. His bent toward science had its origin in certain books, which passed through his hands in the Riebau shop. As a youth Faraday read widely, not only in the sciences but also in other fields of literature. He developed a certain facility and beauty of expression that in later years became one of his great assets. Faraday’s career in experimental science began with the acquisition of a few pieces of chem- ical apparatus. He attended several courses of popular scien- tific lectures and there made the acquaintance of other Young men whose interests were much like his own. The event that changed the whole course of Faraday’s life was an invitation from a Mr. Dance, who visited the Riebau establishment frequently, to attend four lectures by the then famous Sir Humphry Davy. These lectures were de- livered on February 29, March 14, Apri18, and April 10, 1812. Faraday made careful notes of the subject matters, which he later transcribed, and then bound into a book.

Notwithstanding a deep affection for his master, Faraday had developed a dislike for his trade, but neverthe- less he took a position as a journeyman bookbinder with a certain De la Roche. The disagreeable nature of his new em- ployer caused Faraday to reach the definite decision that he had no desire to remain a bookbinder. He confided his longing for scientific work to Mr. Dance, who urged him to Write to Sir Humphry Davy. Faraday followed his friend’s advice, wrote a letter, and sent along the bound notes of Davy’s lectures. Davy was impressed, and asked Faraday to corne to him for an interview. FARADAY APPOINTED TO THE ROYAL INSTITUTION Davy urged upon Faraday the thought that science was a hard and penurious master, but Faraday was not dissuaded. Davy apparently liked the Young bookbinder, for he recom- mended his appointment as a laboratory assistant. Faraday was given the position at a salary of twenty-five shillings a week, together with living quarters at the Royal Institution. The appointment was made in March 1813, and on Octo- ber 13, 1813, Faraday left London to accompany Sir Humphry and Lady Davy on an extended tour of the Con- tinent. They visited France, Belgium, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany, and in the course of their travels they met Ampère, Arago, Gay-Lussac, Chevreul, Dumas, Volta, de La Rive, Biot, de Saussure, de Staël, Count Rumford, and Humboldt. Faraday gained greatly in knowledge and was very happy, except for the unpleasantness caused by Lady Davy who treated him as a servant. They returned to England on April23, 1815, and two weeks later Faraday was again engaged at the Royal Institu- tion, as a laboratory assistant at a salary of thirty shillings"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"per week. During several years that followed, he worked at the sidc of Sir Humphry in the laboratory, and also assisted him at the lecture table. Faraday aided Davy in tbe develop- ment of thç miner’s safety larnp and in nrany of the experi- rnents that Davy was pursuing. bot at the same time Fara- day carried on a certain amount of original research. In 1816 he presented a series of seven lectures before the City Philosophical Society on chemical srrbjects. Although he was becoming known in a limited way, hc was so close to the brilliant Davy that for a time his talents were obscured. On Jur~e 12, 1821, Faraday married Sarah Bernard, who was a member of a religious sect çalled Sandemanians, of wbich Faraday was also a member. Their marriage appears to bave bcen very happy for botb, throughout their long livcs. When Oersted’s discovery of electronlagnetisln waz an- nounced in 1820, Davy brought a copy of the paper to the laboratory immediately, where he and Faraday repeatcd the experiments. Faraday was occupied at the time with mauy special problerns, including alloy steels, but he seerns to bave been muçh impressed with Oersted’s discovery and during his leisure momcnti returned to the experiment many times. He made his first independent discovery after bis marriage, namely, the rotation about a magnetic pale of an etectrical conduçtor carrying a current. This discovery carne on Septcmber 3, 1821, and on Christmas Day of the same year he sbowed his wifc a conductor carrying a cm- rent rotating under the influence of thc earth’s magnetism. During the year 1821, whiçh had been an eventful onc for Faraday, he was made superinteodent of the Royal Institu- tion. In addition to bis lectures, experiments, administrative duties, and researches for thr government, Faraday began"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":", 56 Chapter Four to receive many requests for special research work, of a private nature, some of which he undertook. The fees he received for this work might have made him wealthy, but some years later he gave up such work altogether, because he felt that it was interfering with what he considered more important projects. Faraday’s mind reverted constantly to electrical and mag- netic problems. In 1822 he had written in his notebook the words, “convert magnetism into electricity.” During the years that followed, Faraday returned to this problem again and again. If his apparatus had been better, the discovery would probably have been made in 1824 or 1825. In the meantime important work in other fields was bringing him recognition. He had liquified a number of gases, including chlorine, and had read a paper on the subject in 1823. In 1824 he produced benzol, or benzine, and during that year he also began his researches on optical glass, which contin- ued until 1829. In 1825 Faraday was appointed to the post of director of the laboratory and professor of chemistry at the lnstitu- tion. In 1826 he began his Friday evening lectures, which were to continue for many years, and during that year also, he began his Christmas lectures for children. On Decem- ber 3, 1827, Faraday took as his assistant Sergeant Ander- son who, until his death in 1866, worked faithfully at Fara- day’s side. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION In 1824, Arago had noted that a certain very fine compass, which had had copper in the bottom of its cell, oscillated for only a short time when in its ce11 but when the needle was removed it oscillated over a longer period. The copper was tested and was found to contain no iron. Arago then"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"tried iotating a copper disk under a magnetic needle artd found that the needle tended to follow the rotation of the copper disk. It was found also that other met& exhibited similar effects. Silver showed a greater effect than copper, while lead, mercury, and bismuth were less effective. A copper disk was made to rotate by revolving a magnet near it. Faraday and other researchers were aware of these phe- nomena but none çould offer a satisfactory explanation. In September 1831 Faraday again attacked the problem of producing electricity from magnetisrn. His experiments at this time are described in his Ezperimental Researches in Electricity. His first apparatus consisted of a wooden spool, on which were wound twelve separate helices, insulated from one another with calice and the individu1 turns sep- arated by a winding of twine. He connccted the even nurn- bered coils into one series and thc odd numbered coils into another. The one set of coils he connected to a battery and and the other set to a galvanometer. With a current flowing from the battery, he saw no effect on the galvanometer. Later, with a much more powerful battery, consisting of a hundred cells, connected to a single pair of insulated coils, he noted slight effects on the galvanometer when the circuit was made or broken. The deflection was in one direction when the circuit was made and in the other direction when it was broken. As long as there was a steady flow of curent from the battery, the galvanometer showed no effect. His next experiment is generally considered as the one in which he proved conclusively that eleçtricity could be pro- duced from magnetism. HC used a welded iron ring 6 inches in outside diarneter, of T/a inch soft iron rod. On one sector of the ring he wound threc coils, covering about 9 inches of thc çircunderence, and on arrother part he wound a single coil containingabout 60 fcet of copprr wire, about ‘120 inch"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"58 Chapter Four in diameter. It should be noted that commercially insulated magnet wire did not exist until about twelve or fifteen years later. In Faraday’s description of his experiment, he designated the triple coi1 as “A,” and the single coi1 as “B.” The coi1 “B” was connected to a galvanometer, and the three coils were joined together, with the terminals connected to a battery through a switch. When the battery circuit was closed there was a powerful deflection of the galvanometer in one direction, and when the circuit was opened there was an equally strong deflection in the opposite direction. In his next experiment, Faraday dispensed with the bat- tery and instead made use of a very large compound mag- net. He mounted a helix on an iron bar, which extended out beyond the helix on either side. As the bar carrying the coi1 was brougbt near the magnet, it was drawn suddenly to the poles. The galvanometer, which was connected to the coil, was deflected violently as the bar was attracted to the magnet, SO that the needle spun around. When the bar was pulled suddenly away from the magnet, an equally violent deflection of the galvanometer needle occurred in the oppo- site direction. A single t-uï-Il uf cupper strip about the iron bar was suffi- tient to produce oscillations of the galvanometer needle. When the helix without the iron bar was moved across the field of the magnet, there were wide swings of the galva- nometer needle, but the effect was much weaker than with the iron tore. Faraday made many variations of these experiments, in one of which he produced a steady current through a cop- per disk when it was rotated between the poles of a rnagnet. The galvanorneter connection was made between the axis of the disk and its periphery, with a sliding contact on the"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"latter. This device will be recognized as a unipolar gencra- ter and the reverse of Barlow’s wheel described in the pre- vious chapter. Faraday used the current obtained by induction from his coils to produce a spark between charcoal points, and with the discharge from the same coils hc magnetized needles. He also coostructed a simple loop of wire: whose terminals were conneçted to two commutator segments, upon which tw hrushes rested. When the loop was turned upon its axis in a rnagnetic field, his galvanometer indicated a pulsating, unidirectional current. It now became clear to Faraday what the significance waa of the damped swings of Arago’s compass needle and the revolution of the needlc when placed near a revolving cop- per disk. Induced currents in the copper disk produced magnetic fields that opposed tbe relative motions of disk and needle. Most of this scries of experiments had required the short space of only a few days, and in a few weeks Faraday had a pretty complete notion of the processes of electromagnetic induction. His first paper on the subject was delivercd to the Royal Society on November 24, 1031, entitled “Experi- mental Researches in Electricity.” New of the discoverp caused a tremendous reaçtion throughout tbe world. The way now lay open Cor the conversion of meçhanical energy into electrical energy, but the production of practical ma- chines, by means of which this much-desired end was 10 be açcomplished, still lay in the future.

Whewell, established an important part of our present-day electrical nomenclature. Faraday brought into common use the fol- lowing terms: electrode ion diamagnetic anode cathode electrolyte electrolysis anion cation lines of force paramagnetic dielectric electrochemical equivalent specific induc- tive capacity Berzelius must be considered the father of electrochemis- try, and although Davy made many great new discoveries in this field, it was Faraday who established it as an exact, quantitative science. He developed the theory of ionization and discovered the relationships from which he determined the electrochemical equivalents of a large number of ele- ments. Faraday gave up his private practice about the year 1832. He had accumulated some money, and his needs were rela- tively simple. He did, however, continue to serve the British government in many ways. He became a lecturer at the Woolwich Royal Military Academy in 1829 and continued in this capacity until 1849. For a number of years he was a consultant to Trinity House on lighthouses, and in 1847 he proposed lighting buoys with incandescent lamps using plat- inum spiral filaments. No other man contributed SO much to electrical science as did Faraday, and his achievements were recognized during"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"his lifetime hy many learned societies and universities in many countries. He was humble, kindly, deeply religious, quiet, persevering, and had almost an intuitive insight into nrany of nature‘s secrets, and beheld the wonders of crea- tion with a reverent awc. His life ended in 1867. JOSEPH HENRY There is an amazing similarity between Faraday’s IXe and works and those of his American contemporary, Joseph Henry. The two rnen were very rnuch alike in many re- spects. Henry ws horn at Albany, IVew York, either on Decemher 17, 17Yî: or 17YY, probably the latter. The cor,- fusion is due to the fact that the record in the old register at Albany is not very distinct. He was of Scottish ancestry. At an early age he went to live with his materna1 grand- mother at Galway in Saratoga County where Ire attended the district school. At the age of ten hc began working hall days at a store in thc village and attended school only part- lime. While he was still at Galway, hc gainrd accç~s to a library in the village church, and as a result hc became a passionate reader. At the age of fifteen, Joseph left Galway and returned to his mother’s house in Albany. His father had died some ycars earlier, and I us mother supporte<1 hcrself and her SO,, by keeping boarders. For a lime, aîter his retwu to Alban)-, it seemed that Joseph might bccome an actor. Ile had CO~I- siderable talents in acting, in arranging scenery, and in plny- writing, but his interests were srrddenly shiftcd in another direction. At the agc of sixteen, hc wos confined tu the house for B bricf period due to an accident. While he was SO confined, he happened upon a book belonging to a gentle- man who was then a boarder nt his mother’s house. The book was entitled Lectures on Experimental Philosophy,"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"62 Chapter Four Astronomy, and Chemistry by Dr. Gregory. This book SO fascinated Young Henry that he resolved, forthwith, to devote his life to serious study. Upon his recovery, Joseph Henry appeared before the other members of “The Rostrum,” a dramatic organization of which he was then president, and tendered his resigna- tion. His next step was to enter a night school, whose facili- ties he soon exhausted. He then took up English grammar and rhetoric with a private teacher. These studies were fol- lowed by a brief period of tutoring, after which he entered Albany Academy as an advanced pupil. In order to meet his expenses, he began teaching in a neighboring school. Next he became an assistant at the Academy, and a little later he accepted a position in the family of S. Van Rensselaer as a private tutor. While he was in the Van Rensselaer house- hold, he had much leisure time, which he devoted to studies in the subjects which interested him most. He was at this time considering preparing himself for the medical profession, but it happened that he was offered a position as a surveyor with a party engaged in laying out a new road in southern New York, and he accepted the offer. A few months later, after the survey had been completed, Henry was offered a professorship at Albany Academy, which offer he quickly accepted. HENRY’!3 FIRST EXCURSIONS INTO SCIENCE The great series of electrical experiments and discoveries that soon brought fame to Joseph Henry began here at Albany Academy. For an American city of that period Albany was well suited to the development of scientific pursuits, because there were several societies whose purpose was to promote scientific experiments and discussion. Dr. Beck, who was president of Albany Institute, which"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"was one of these organizations, presented a series of lec- tures on chernistry, at whicb he was assisted by tlenry. Unfortunatcly Henry’s duties as a professor occupied SO much of his time that he had little leisorr for experiment. His teaçhing required seven hours of each day, eleven months of the year. Henry’s rarliest scientifiç papers dealt with the adiabatic expansion of steam aod with tbe cooling effects produçed by the expansion of gases. At this time, he was also assisting in compiling meteorological data for the Albany area. Ilis first electrical paper, delivered before the Albany Academy on October 10, 1827, dealt with the subject of electronlagnetisrn, and in this paper be described an electro- magnet made by William Sturgeon of London in 1825. Ilenry described this magnet as borscshoe shaped, wound with a single widety spaced layer of eightecn turns of wire over a wrnish-insulated iron tore. With a powerful battery this magnet WBS capable of lifting 0 pounds. Sturgeon’s magnet was the fi& to employ an iron tore. Ampère snd Arago in France had made helices that behaved like mag- nets in 1820 and 1821. Jobann Sçhweigger of Halle, Ger- many, aided by J.C. Yoggendorff, built their so-callcd multi- plier in 1820, in which çlosely spaced coils of wire insulated with fabric werc wound upon a nonmagnetic spool. By combining the ideas associated with tbe Sturgeon eleç- tromagnet and thç Schweigger multiplier, Ilenry began thç construction of clectromagoets in which he was the first to use superirnposed coils of insolated wire, wound upon horseshoe-shaprd iron cores. Tbe insulation, wbich was applied by hand, was cotton or silk. For a later electromag- net it was said that Henry used a silk dress belonging to bis wife. In 1820, be demonstrated an electromagnet using 400 torns of wire with a lifting power of many pounds, but"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"64 Chapter Four the exact figure is not known nor is the power of his bat- tery. Later in the same year he completed another magnet, with a %-inch iron tore wound with several coils. He be- lieved it was necessary to distribute the magnetizing force along the tore. Because his electromagnets had coils with many turns, he called them intensity magnets. This latter magnet, with a small battery, supported a weight of 39 pounds. HENRY PROPOSES THE ELECTROMAGNETIC TELEGRAPH After constructing a number of electromagnets, Henry be- came interested in operating an electromagnet at a distance. In 1830 he connected one to the end of a line 1030 feet long and was able to operate it successfully from the other end. Henry pointed out that it was possible to construct a telegraph in this way. With the aid of P. Ten Eyck, he next built an electromag- net with a tore weighing 21 pounds, wound with nine coils, each of which contained 60 feet of wire, insulated with waxed cotton. This magnet supported 750 pounds. In 1831 at Yale College Henry supervised the making of an electro- magnet that supported 2065 pounds. ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION Unlike Faraday, Henry did not keep a notebook to record his ideas and experiments, nor did he Write many papers at this period of his life. In a later paper he mentions an experiment, which he conducted in the early 183Os, in which he discovered independently the principle of electro- magnetic induction, but Henry credited Faraday with the discovery. The apparatus used by Henry consisted of an iron bar in the middle of which was a coi1 connected to a"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"galvanometer. He placed the iron bar carrying the coil across the poles of an electromagnet connected to a battery and found that when he raised and lowered the plates of the battery into and out of the electrolyte, the galva- nometer needle was deflected, first in one direction and then in the other. SELF-INDUCTION Mile Faraday deserves the credit for the discovery of elec- tromagnetic induction, it was Henry who first discovered self-induction. Self-induction is that property of an eleçtri- cal circuit that causes a counter electromotive force when the circuit is made or broken and is designated by the symbol L. A little later, Faraday discovered self-induction independently. Henry was honored in the use of his name for the unit of self-induction. MARRIAGE AND PROFESSORWIP AT PRINCETON Henry had now become famous, but he remained a poor professor, and while money matters were of little concern to him, the lack of money undoubtedly hampered him in his experimental pursuits. Despite his poverty and the im- probability that he could ever hope to earn a comfortable living, he had married Ilarriet L. Alexander, his cousin, in 1830. The mariage appears to bave been a happy ont in which six children were born to them, three of whorn sur- vived Henry. Near the end of the year 1832, Henry was offered the chair of Natural Yhilosophy at Princeton Univcrsity, which he promptly accepted. As was the case at Albany, his teach- ing duties were arduous and afforded him little Lime for experiment. In addition to his regular courses, whicb io modem terms would probably be called physics, he also"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"66 Chapter Four taught chemistry, minerology, geology, astronomy, and architecture. His burdens of pedagogy notwithstanding, he found time to construct another magnet with a lifting power of 1 Yz tons. He also installed a telegraph signal, in- cluding a relay, between the college and his house, a dis- tance of about a mile, using the earth as one side of the circuit. During what were rather happy years for him in the aca- demie surroundings of Princeton University, he continued his experiments in electromagnetism, electromagnetic in- duction, and self-induction. He was loved and revered by his students and was regarded as perhaps the foremost scientist in his field in America. In 1837, the university sought to reward Henry in some measure for the extraordinary services he had rendered, both to the university and to the world at large. He was granted a one-year leave of absence to visit Europe, on which visit he was accompanied by A. D. Bache, a descen- dant of Benjamin Franklin. Henry was received with great courtesy by European scientists, including Faraday, Wheat- stone, Daniell, Arago, and de La Rive. He was also invited to speak before gatherings of the learned societies. ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Refreshed by his sojourn in Europe, Henry returned to his post at Princeton and to his experiments. I-le had discovered the essential principles of the transformer and experi- mented with coils placed at varying distances from each other. He also discovered the oscillatory nature of the dis- charge of a Leyden jar by discharging one across a gap through a circuit containing a small coil. In this coi1 he"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"placed an unmagnetized steel needle and found that after discharging the Leyde” jar the needle was magnetized, sometimes in one direction, and again in the opposite direc- tion. This small coil and needle became very important in other experiments, as for example in detecting the inductive ef- fects of lightning, whiçh Ire accomplished by connecting the coil between the met4 roof of his houx and the ground. Lightning flashes up to 20 miles away caused the needle to be magnetized. In a somewhat similar expcriment, he made a discovery whose grc‘eat importance was not recognized until fifty years later. For this experiment, nenry strung a circuit of wire about the pcrimrter of the uppcr floor of a building, and a similar closed circuit, containing the çoil and needle, around the walls of the çellar. The two circuits were about 30 feet apart. When a Leyden jar was discharged through the circuit on the upper floor, he found that the needle in the coil in the cellar had bcen magnetizcd. Frorn his dc- scription of this experiment it is clear that Henry recog- nizcd that he w’as dealing with a phcnomenor~ different from thc electromagnetic induction erperiments, in which the coils were close together and connected by magnetic circuits contnining iron. He compared the effects in the present expcriment with those of light and spoke of the disturhance being propagated wave-fashion. OTHER RESEARCHES \\Vhile still a professor at Princeton, Henry carried on re- searches in many other fields, notably in meteorology, but also in metallurgy, ballistics, light, and astronomy. The con- genial atmosphere at Princeton held Henry for fifteen years."},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"68 Chapter Four THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION In the year 1837 the United States government received a bequest of about $500,000 from the estate of James Smithson, an Englishman, for the purpose of founding “at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men. ” For ten years the bequest was tossed about in Congress, but an organization was formed and a board of re- gents appointed. After SO many years of deliberation the board of regents, in 1847, asked Joseph Henry to become the director of the Smithsonian Institution and to under- take its organization. The founding of the Smithsonian Institution brings up a very interesting parallel. The Royal Institution in London was founded in 1799, and the moving spirit in its founding was Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford), an American by birth, who had a most colorful career in Austria, En- gland, and France. It was he who first appointed Sir Humphry Davy as the head of the Royal Institution. The Smithsonian Institution was founded by an Englishman, but it was Joseph Henry who gave it purpose and direction. The offer of the regents was accepted by Henry, where- upon he resigned his professorship at Princeton and moved to Washington. He presented an outline of his conception of the organization and purposes of the Institution which the regents accepted. For thirty-two years Henry guided the Smithsonian Institution, writing, administering, planning, and experimenting. Under Henry’s administration, the original bequest was not, as might have been expected, dis- sipated but rather increased to more than double its original value.

Tbe purely researçh aspects of elcctricity were now blending inlo engineeriog problems. PIXII’S MACHINE The first small machine was built in 1832 by Hypolite Pixii of Paris, an instrument rnaker who had become interested in eleçtriçity. This machine was, in modem terms, a mag- neto and consisted of two coils ou a U-shapcd tore, thc polc faces of which werr opposite the poles of a revolving permanent magnet. In its original form the machine pro- duçed alternating çurrent, but Pixii also built machines in whiçh the coils revolved and whiçh were equipped with commutators. In the samc year, Dal Negro, an Italian, built a similar magneto clcctric machine independently of Pixii. Many others became interested in building small magneto machines over the next eighteen years, including Sax~on of Philadelphia in 1833, K. M. Clarke of England in 1834, and Page of Washington in 1835. I)uring tbis period, there were probably vast numbers of other suçh machines built by unknown scient&, professors, mechanics, and others.

(Courtesy Burndy Library) Brussels. With the aid of his assistant, Joseph Van Malderen, he built a large machine in which thirty-two permanent magnets were mounted on a stationary frame in longitu- dinal rows, spaced at equal angular distances. The rotor within this frame consisted of a number of coils equal to the number of pole faces of the permanent magnets on the stator. The magnet poles were, of course, arranged SO that they were alternately north and south, and the coils were con-"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"nected in such a mariner that tbe induced electromotive forces became additivc. The terminal wires were connected to insulated rings mounted on the shaft, which had brushes bearing upon them in much thc same manner as later alter- nating-curent machines. AL 400 rcvolutions per minute this machine produced 6400 alternations per minute, or 53l/3 cycles. Because voltage hod not yet beerr defined, the pres- sure is not known, but since a similar macbine was used later for arc lights, we may assume tbat it was in the vicin- ity of 50 volts or perhaps a littlc more. The exact date of Nollet’s machine is indefinite, but it was probably about 1849 or 1850. In 1853 a company was organized in Paris for the purpose of manufacturing ma- chines on the Nollet design. This company, called the Alli- ance Company, was probably the first electrical manufac- turing concern in the world. It produced several sizes of machines, having from thirty-two to forty-eight magnets, and from sixty-four to ninety-six coils. Originalty the Alli- ance machines were to be used for electrochemical work and, what now seems stranger still, for the decomposition of water to obtain oxygen and hydrogen for use with thc limelight or calcium light. For this purpose thc machines were equipped with commutators. Unfortunately, the use of the machine for tbe decomposition of water was a busi- ness faiturr. F. H. Holmes, of Engtand, adapted the Alliance machine to arc ligbting, using carbon points. Motive power was fur- nished by a steam engine, and it was found that it required 5 horsepower to supply the electrical energy for one 1100.candlepower arc lamp. This and similar machines were soon put to work in several British lighthouses and Faraday himself directed the fint installation at South Foreland in 1858."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"74 Chapter Five DYNAMOS In 1845 Wheatstone suggested the use of electromagnets in place of permanent magnets for the fields of the new ma- chines, and similar suggestions came from Soren Hjorth of Denmark and Varley of England. The first such machine was built by H. Wilde of Manchester. It was not self- exciting, but instead it was equipped with a small magneto used as an exciter. This arrangement was eminently success- fui, SO much SO that the machine overheated because of overload and also because of eddy-current losses in the solid iron cores of the armature and field magnets. Wilde’s machine employed the shuttle armature, which had been invented a short time previously by Dr. Werner Siemens of Berlin. The success of this machine was fol- lowed shortly by the construction of self-exciting machines at almost the same time hy Moses G. Farmer of Salem, Massachusetts, Alfred Varley and Charles Wheatstone of England, and Dr. Werner Siemens of Berlin. These were called dynamoelectric machines, or simply dynamos, as contrasted with the magnetoelectric machines, or magnetos. Antonio Pacinotti of Florence, Italy, developed a slotted ring armature in 1860, which was the prot.otype of most later machines. Lénobe Théophile Gramme of Belgium, who had been a patternmaker for the Alliance Company, in 1871 constructed a ring armature, in which the coils were wound on a smooth iron ring. Although the Gramme arrna- ture was a more recent development, it was later abandoned in favor of the Pacinotti type. ELECTRIC MOTORS Many experimenters had sought to convert electrical into rnechanical energy or, in other words, had sought to build an electric motor. Several such devices bave been men-"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"tioned previously in this work, such as tbe whirligigs of milson and Hamilton, Franklin’s electric wheel, Barlow’s wheel, and Faraday% revolving conductor, but none of tbese was of any practical value. In 3832 Sturgeon buill a small electric motor of a general type, of which there were many variations, in whicb con- tact is made at regular inlervals ta energize an electro- rnagnet, causing it to attract a revolving iron bar as it ap- proaches ~bc rnagnet’s polcs. Ilenry built n walking-bearn motor on this principle. The mosl notewortby attempt of this kind was made by Thomas LIavenport, a blacksmitb of Brandon, Vermont, in 1834. He built such a motor power- fui enougb to operate a small electric railway, and in 11140 he opcrated a printing press witb tbe power supplied by one of his motors. Professor Jacobi of St. Petersburg built a somwhat similar motor in 1834, and in 1839, witb tbe use of such a motor, propelled n boat carrying fourtren passcngers. 4 Scotch- rnan, Robert Davidson, in 1838 built an electric car weigh- ing 6 tons. Tbere wete witbout doubt bundreds of otber similar attcmpts, but until tbr last quarter of the nineteentb century tbere were two serious draw-backs: there ~8s as yet no satisfactory motor, and there was no cbeap source of eleetric power.

During tbe period under consideration many new forms of voltaic cetls appcared. In tbe lïrst tbirty years after Volta, practically att batteries KCX simple copper ond zinc couples in an acid solution. Volta himself bad compiled a list of elements, known as the clectromotive series; wbicb in- dicated tbc electricnt pressures that coutd be developed be- tween various couples.

The zinc electrode was in a porous cup, in a zinc sulfate solution, and the copper elec- trode in cylindrical form surrounding the cup was immersed in a copper sulfate solution, a11 of which was contained in a cylindrical glass jar. This battery did not polarize and used neutral salts that were only mildly corrosive, and it was not expensive. It delivered about 1.1 volts as we measure elec- tromotive force today. A modification of the Daniel1 cell, known as the gravity, crowfoot, or bluestone battery, was widely used on American telegraph lines for many years. In this battery, the two fluids were separated from each other by the difference in their specific gravities. The zinc sulfate, being lighter, floated above the copper sulphate. In its usual form the zinc, or negative, element was a heavy casting with radiating fingers (hence the name crowfoot) which was clamped over the top of the battery jar by a lug opposite the fingers. Th e copper element was made up of three or five copper leaves, held together by a copper rivet in the tenter, with the outer leaves bent outward in arcs to form a somewhat star-shaped figure. The copper element was laid on the bottom, immersed in the copper sulfate solution, and was connected to the outside by means of an insulated copper wire that ran up the side of the jar and was bent over the edge. In another modification of the Daniel1 cell, devised by J. H. Meidinger, a spherical glass flask with a long neck was filled with copper sulfate solution, with the neck immersed in the part of the Daniel1 ce11 outside the porous cup. When a battery of any of these types was in operation, copper from the copper sulfate solution was deposited on the cop- per electrode, while at the same time the zinc element was converted into zinc sulfate by chemical action of the free SO4 ions, released by the copper sulfate, attacking the zinc"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"electrodc. The cffect was to incrcasc tbe quantity of zinc sulfate and diminisb the quantity of copper sulfate; and tberefore, as the battery operated, some of tbe zinc sulfate solution had to he removed from time to time, and tbe copper sulfate replenisbcd. In the Meidingcr battery this was accomplished by means of the flask, and in the gravity battery copper sulfate crystals were placed in the bottom, zinc sulfate drawn off, and the watcr replenished. THE GROVE CELL Sir W. K. Grave, in 1839, devised a çell in which a zinc electrode was placed in a porous cup in a dilute sulfuric acid solution, and outside tbe cup was a platinum plate in conçentrated nitric acid. The Grave battery had a high electromotive force, about 1.9 volts, and it did not polarize, but it n’as objectionable because it gave off disagreeable brown fumes produced by nitric acid, and the strong acids were highly corrosive. Furthermore the platinum electrode was very expensive. Bunsen altered the Grave cell somewhat in 1842 by sub- stituting a carbon rod for the platinum element. This change reduced the cost, but tbe otber objections to the Grave battery still remained. The Bunsen cell was, never- theless, used rather extensively. Its voltage was the same as the Crove battery, about 1.9. THE LECLANCHÉ CELL The most widely used batteries wcre those invented by Georges Leclanché, whicb were known by that name. The elements in tbe Leclanché battery werc zinc and carbon in an electrolyte of ammonium cbloride (sa1 ammoniac). The earlier forms, called wet batteries, were made with a large carbon cylinder, in the çenter of which ~ILS a zinc rod"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"80 Chapter Six separated from the carbon by an insulator. These batteries polarized rather quickly, but this fault was partially over- corne by making the carbon electrode large and porous SO as to absorb and distribute the hydrogen that appeared on the positive electrode. A later form of the Leclanché ce11 was the dry battery, which was widely used in telephone work and for rnany othcr purposes, especially flashlights. In its usual form, the dry ce11 consists of a zinc container, which is also the nega- tive electrode, the inside of which is lined with paper and filled with a mixture of granulated carbon and manganese dioxide saturated with ammonium chloride, with a carbon electrode in the tenter. More recent dry cells have a steel jacket on the outside to prevent damage by efflorescence. Polarization is minimized by the manganese dioxide, which gives up oxygen to form water with the hydrogen. OTHER BATTERIES There were numerous other forms of batteries which were used at various times. Among these were the Fuller, Krüger, Lalande-Chaperon, Partz, Grenet, bichromate, and Smee. The Edison-Lalande battery is somewhat similar to the Lalande-Chaperon battery except that in the Edison- Lalande battery the positive electrode is copper oxide in- stead of iron, but the electrolyte in both cases is a solution of caustic potash. The Edison-Lalande battery was rather widely used in the United States for railway signal work, because, among other reasons, the battery did not freeze. Two standard cells have been introduced for use in the laboratory. One of these is the Weston ce11 which has elec- trodes of cadmium and mercury and an electrolyte of cadmium sulfate. Its voltage is 1.0183 at 20” Celsius. The other is the Clark ce11 with electrodes of zinc and mercury"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"and an electrolyte of zinc sulfate. lts voltage is 1.4328 at 15” Celsius. In recent years several types of dry cells have been pro- duccd in quantitics because of their special uses. ‘Thcy havc such advantages as geater discharge capacities and longer life; in some cases they are rechargeable. These batteries are not necessarily new. There is a rnercury battery that has a potassium hydroxide electrolyte. The nickel-cadmium battery is rechargeable. Another rechargeable battery is the manganese-zinc battery with a potassium-hydroxide electrolyte. If çompletely dis- charged this battery is ruined. Otherwise it may be charged up to about fifty times. The silver cbloride battery dates back to 1860 and is still used for special purposes. %ORAGE BATTERIES The principle of the secondary, or storage, hattery was dis- covered early, but for many years was of only scientific interest because there was nothing to be gained by charging one hattery with another; the situation changed greatly when the dynamo appeared. Gaston Planté, who had been investigating polarization, made the very important dis- covery in 1860 that lead plates imrnersed in a sulfuric acid solution and charged constituted an excellent secondary battery. When such a battery was charged, a thin layer of lead dioxide was formed on the positive plate, while the negativc plate was converted into sponge lead. Planté’s hat- teries were forrned by repcated charging and discharging, a process that was slow and expensivc. In his enrlier batteries he rolled together two sheets of lead, separated hy heavy linen, gutta-percha, or ruhher. Later he constructed hat- teries with multiple Clat Plates in which the positive and"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"82 Chapter Six negative elements were interleaved, as in a modern storage battery. Inspired by Planté’s successes, others began to experiment with secondary batteries, notably Camille Faure, also a Frenchman, who in 1881, patented a battery with lead plates to which had been applied a coating of red lead. The red lead was more easily converted to lead dioxide and sponge lead than the pure lead in Planté5 battery. The Faure battery also had more active material and hence greater capacity. A further improvement was made by Sellon and by Volckmar, who prepared the plates with grooved or per- forated faces, and the depressions were then filled with red lead paste before the forming process. Batteries of this type, with further improvements, were built by Swan in England and Brush in the United States. Another improve- ment that followed shortly was the use of cast grids con- taining a small yuantity of antimony. ELECTROSTATIC INDUCTION MACHINES Electrical currents of considerable magnitude were now available from batteries, magnetos, and dynamos, but there was still great interest in the older electrostatic machines. There were many of the old frictional machines in use for experimental purposes in laboratories, but Volta’s electro- phorus and Bennet’s doubler had shown that an original small charge could be increased many times by manipula- tion. Holtz and Toepler in Germany and Wimshurst in En- gland devised new electrical machines based on the induc- tion principle, SO arranged that after a few turns a small initial charge was increased to a very large one. In these machines, as well as in an earlier one by C. F. Varley, sec- tors of metal foi1 were mounted on glass disks, which"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"in turn were mounted on shafts SO that they could be revolved. Charges were built up by induction from disks on a neighboring plate. In the H&z and Toepler machine, the second disk was stationary, whereas in the Wimshurst nn- chine the plates revolved in opposite directions. These new electrostatic machines were built in great num- bers for experimental purposes and also for the medical profession, 10 be used for the treatment of disease. Vol- umes were written on the subjecl of eleçtrotherapeutics, and eleclrodes of ail conceivable shapes were designed to reach the various organs or tissues to be treated. no pro- gressive or prosperous physician’s office was without a Holtz or Wimshurst machine and a multitude of accessories. Some of these machines were of grcat sice, and they per- formed miracles, if the reports of the period could be be- lieved, but miracles notwithstanding the machines gradually disappearcd from the physiçians’ offices. We may douht thc testimon& regarding thc alleviation of human suffering, but these machines did çontrihute in a very substantial way to the inçrease of knowledge and af- forded muçh cntcrtainment. One of the most beautiful ex- pcriments thal could be performed with such a machine was with Geisslcr tubes. Heinrich C;e&ler was a glassblower at tbe university at Bonu, Germany. His tubes were made in many fantastic shapes; some were evacuated, while others containcd traces of various gases or mercury. Many of thr glass eovelopes çontained mctalliç salts that fluoresçed when excited by the electrical machine. In some respects, Geissler tubes anticipated modem tube or fluorescent light- ing. During thc early part of this period, tbe most important developrnent was the introductiou of the eleçtromagnetic telegraph, but this is a story in ilself and Will be told later."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"84 Chapter Six The electric bel1 was the first electrical device to be used extensively in homes. The inventor of the electric bel1 is not definitely known, but it may have been Miraud of Rouen, France, or his compatriot Leclanché, the inventor of the sal-ammoniac battery. Before the large-scale commercial use of electricity for lighting, there were electrical concerns manufacturing tele- graph instruments, insulated wire, table, batteries, in- sulators, bells, and many telegraph accessories. These con- cerns were often instrumental in the development of new apparatus such as annunciators, burglar alarms, fire alarms, and railway signals. As the scope of the industry widened, several of these firms took over the manufacture of dynamos, lighting equipment, switches, sockets, fixtures, fuses, and a hundred other items. Some of these companies became the nuclei of the great electrical manufacturing con- cerns of today."},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"7 Electrical Instruments, La~s, and Definitions of Units ~More electriçity could beçome an exact science, capable of mathematical analysis, it was essential that its properties be defined in terms of measurable units. Certain concepts regardirrg electrical power, pressures, quantitics, rates of flow, and those relating to circuits, such as reaistance, self- induction, capacity, and still others relating ta dielectrics and chernical action had already been well established be- fore the units of measurenrent were defined. Similar ideas regarding magnetism and magnetic circuits existed. TANGENT GALVANOMETER A great many instruments of various kirlds bave already been mentioned in previous chapters, some of whicb were nrere indicators, and others provided accurate quantitative measurements. A great improvement in the Scbweigger and Poggendorff multiplier was made by Pouillet in 1837, at wbich time he invented the tangent galvanometer. This iw strument had a relatively large coi1 with a diamcter of 30 centimeters or more, at the centcr of whicb was a short magnetic needle to which a pointer was attached at rigbt angles that moved over a scale divided into degrees. When no current flowed through thç coil, the needte came to rest in the magnetic meridian, but when a current was sent through tbe coi!, witb the plane of the toit in tbc magot-tic meridian, the needle took a position which was in the direc- tion of tbe resultant of tbe forces produced by tbe eartb’s magnetic field and the field produced by the carrent flow- ing through the coil.

Weber greatly improved this instru- ment in 1846 by attaching a small mirror to the needle, in which the reflections of a scale could be read through a telescope. In the same year Weber also built a moving coi1 galvanometer, as opposed to the stationary coi1 in the tan- gent galvanometer. This instrument depended only on the interaction between the field produced by the coi1 and the earth’s field. D’ARSONVAL GALVANOMETER The most reliable of a11 galvanometers was that invented by Deprez and d’Arsonva1 in 1862, known as the d’Arsonva1 galvanometer. In this instrument a small moving coi1 was suspended between the poles of a permanent magnet. The magnet was provided with concave pole faces. A cylindrical iron tore was mounted between the pole faces, leaving a gap on either side sufficient for the coi1 to swing without touching. Originally the coi1 was suspended on torsion wires that were also lead-in wires for the coil. Later the coi1 was mounted on jeweled bearings with hairsprings used as a restraining force and also used as conductors for the cur- rent. WHEATSTONE BRIDGE Wheatstone’s bridge, as it is commonly known, although according to Silvanus P. Thompson, it was invented by Christie, came into use about 1843. It was the first accurate device for comparing resistances. In it an unknown resis- tance could be inserted into a divided circuit that included three known resistances, a battery, and a galvanometer. When the known resistances, one of which was variable, were properly balanced SO that the galvanometer reading"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"88 Chapter Seven was zero, the unknown resistance could be calculated by a simple proportion. ELECTRICAL AND MAGNETIC LAWS The advent of accurate measuring instruments made it pos- sible to verify and extend electrical and magnetic laws that in many cases had been proposed on the basis of partial information. Some of these laws have already been men- tioned, such as the inverse square laws for electric and mag- netic fields by Coulomb, the law governing the force be- tween a conductor carrying a current and a magnetic pole by Ampère, and Ohm’s law, which was announced in a paper in 1827, entitled “Die Galvanische Kette.” Before units of measurement for electricity and mag- netism could be established, it was necessary to define cer- tain fundamental relationships by laws expressed in the form of equations. It is regrettable that we do not know the authors or the years for some of these laws, particularly the magnetic laws, but it is probable that many if not a11 of them were the work of Gauss. Between the years 1820 and 1862 electrical and magnetic laws, measurements, and units were firmly established through the efforts of a long list of workers including Ampére, Coulomb, Biot, Savart, Faraday, Henry, Ohm, Poisson, Pouillet, Gauss, Weber, Lenz, Rie- mann, Kirchhoff, Neumann, Kohlrausch, Green, Joule, Lord Kelvin, von Helmholtz, and Maxwell. The accomplishments of these men were greatly in- fluenced by the work of Newton as set forth in his Principia. Newton was the first scientist to apply mathe- matics to such general natural laws. Newton had established the inverse square law for gravitational fields, although Hooke had claimed credit for the principle.

Table 7.1 gives the fundamental electric and magnetic equations upon which the definitions of units were based. ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC UNITS Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Wilhelm Weber (1804- 1891) were the principal authors of the electric and magnetic units. Gauss developed a system of magnetic units in 1832, using the millimeter, milligram, and second as the units of length, mass, and time. In 1839 Gauss defined electric potential at a given point in the electrostatic system as the work required to move a unit charge from infinity to that point. Beginning in 1840, Weber developed the defini- tions of the electric units in the electromagnetic system. He also, as did Gauss, used the millimeter, milligram, second system. Other scientists generally preferred the centimeter, gram, second system, or, as it is generally known, the cgs system."},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"90 Chapter Seven For some years after Gauss and Weber there were no widely accepted units for electricity and magnetism. In 1861 the Committee on Electrical Standards of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, under the leadership of William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin), was given the task of formulating definitions that would be con- sistent with one another and would be reproducible. They recognized the work already accomplished by Gauss and Weber and proceeded from that point. In the committee’s report of 1864 it established values for the practical units of electromotive force and resistance, based upon the meter, gram, second system. This committee established the practical unit of electromotive force, which it called the volt, at lO* times the absolute electromagnetic unit. The practical unit of resistance, which this committee called the ohm, was established at 109 times the emu absolute unit. From these definitions of the volt and ohm the practical unit of current would become l/le the emu absolute unit. A later committee of the British Association recom- mended in 1873 the use of the cgs system instead of the mgs system. This committee also recommended the use of the terms erg and dyne for the absolute units of work and force. These recommendations met with general approval throughout the scientific world. The first International Electrical Congress met in Paris in 1881 and approved the cgs system as the basis for the definitions of the electric and magnetic units. The Paris International Congress confirmed the definitions estab- lished by the British A ssociation in 1864 and 1873. It also defined and named the coulomb and farad. Neither the British Association nor the International Con- gress gave any consideration to the esu absolute system of units.

Weber noted the numerical ratio between the two systems in 1846. In 1856 Weber and Kohlrausch found that the dimensions of this ratio constituted a velocity which equaled the velocity of light, within the limits of experimental error. The velocity of light was known approximately at that time from the observations of Roemer in 1676 on the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites. The first accurate, terrestrial measurements were made by Fizeau in 1849. The fourth International Electrical Congress met at the World’s Fair in Chicago in 1893. It confirmed the previous definitions of the absolute and practical units and defined a prototype of the standard ohm as the resistance of a col- umn of mercury 106.3 centimeters in length, and 1 square millimeter in cross section at a temperature of 0” Celsius. The prototype of the volt was given in terms of the voltage of the Clark standard ce11 whose voltage was given as 1.434 volts at O°Celsius. There were periodic meetings of the International Electri- cal Congress at which refinements in the definitions were discussed but in general the original absolute and practical units remained unchanged. Suggestions were made from time to time for modifications in the definitions of the units. In 1882 Heaviside suggested changing the definition of the unit magnetic pole SO as to eliminate the factor 4~ that occurs in certain of the fundamental equations. Foppl in 1894 proposed changes in the coefficients of the funda- mental magnetic and electric units for the sake of greater symmetry. Lorentz called this the Gaussian system. Giorgi in 1901 proposed a combination of these suggestions with the mks (meter, kilogram, second) system. These and other proposals Will be discussed later."},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"Electrical Instruments and Laws 91 Figure 7.2 Lord Kelvin (From Bumdy Library)"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"94 Chapter Seven than the practical, emu, or esu which have been introduced are the following: mks (meter-kilogram-second), mksa (meter-kilogram-second-ampere), Giorgi (Same as mksa), Heaviside-Lorentz (rationalized system that suppresses the factor, 47~), and Gaussian (electric units numerically equal to esu and magnetic units equal to emu). The IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission), which was organized in 1904, is now an arm of UNESCO in the field of electrical engineering. It and its committees are now responsible for the definitions of electric and magnetic units. In 1935 the EMMU committee of the IEC adopted the mks system, and in 1950 the U. S. Congress passed a law fixing the electric units for the United States as defined in the mksa system. The subject of electric and magnetic units has now be- corne SO involved that it would be impossible to discuss the matter fully in this history. Volumes have been written on this subject, but the best and most concise review of the present state of the matter is U. S. Bureau of Standards Monograph 56 written by the late Francis B. Silsbee, pub- lished in 1962, and reprinted in 1963."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"8 The Electric Telegraph The need for rapid communication between distant points has been felt from the beginnings of civilization. Many early methods were devised, some of which operated with a fair degree of success and are still in use. Among these devices are semaphores, smoke signals, drums, the firing of cannon, heliographs, blinker lights, bells, and others. In the time of Pierre de Maricourt it was proposed to use compass needles for signaling, on the theory that the movement of one compass needle would cause a similar movement in another needle, even at a great distance. Magnetic needles did in fact become part of certain telegraphic devices at a later date. After Stephen Gray’s discovery of the transmission of electricity over conducting threads and the experiments that followed, in which Leyden jars were discharged over great lengths of wire, the thoughts of many turned to the use of electricity for communication. Gray’s experiments were made in 1729, and in 1746 Winckler set up an electric telegraph in which there were as many wires as there were characters to be transmitted. Scots Magazine published in 1753 an anonymous letter, later ascribed to Charles Morrison, which proposed using many wires each of which would terminate in a metal bal1 corresponding with a letter of the alphabet. Near each bal1 was to be hung a strip of paper, properly labeled, which would be attracted when a charge was sent over the line. He also suggested the use of glass insulators for supporting the wires. Lomond proposed in 1787 using a single wire with a pith bal1 electroscope at the receiving end and, presumably, using some sort of code.

Sommering built a multiple-wire telegraph at Munich in 1809, using Volta’s recently discovered batteries and Carlisle and Nicholson’s discovery of the decomposition of water. Each of the wires in Sommering’s telegraph terminated in a cup of acidulated water, SO that when the circuit was closed, through the battery, bubbles of gas were liberated in the appropriate cell. EARLY ELECTROMAGNETIC TELEGRAPHS After Oersted’s discovery of electromagnetism and Schweig- ger’s invention of his galvanometer or multiplier, both Ampère and Laplace proposed electromagnetic telegraphs employing coils and magnetic needles at the receiving end, equal in number to the cliaracters to be transmitted, with a corresponding number of wires. Harrison Gray Dyar built a telegraph line on Long Island, New York, which operated during the years 1828 and 1829, in which messages were recorded on a moving strip of paper by electrochemical means. Joseph Henry’s line, built in 1830, has already been men- tioned. On this line he used the equivalent of a telegraph sounder. Weber and Gauss built a telegraph line at Gottingen in 1833, which was nearly a mile in length, in which the receiving device was a galvanometer. In the same year Baron Schilling constructed a telegraph line at St. Petersburg, using five needles in his receiving apparatus. Wheatstone’s telegraph of 1837 employed a single needle and was the first to be used commercially. A considerable amount of telegraph business developed in England during the ensuing years. In 1837 Steinheil constructed a telegraph line at Munich, more than 12 kilometers in length, using a"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 97 receiving apparatus that recorded the message on a paper tape by means of dots. Steinheil also discovered in 1838 that it was possible to use the earth for one side of the circuit. SAMUEL F. B. MORSE Many others were giving serious thought to the problem of the electric telegraph, among whom was Samuel F. B. Morse (1791-I872), who had acquired a limited scientific knowledge during his undergraduate days at Yale University. At this time, however, Morse was far more inter- ested in painting than in science, and to this end he spent the years 1811 to 1815 in England studying art. Upon his return to the United States he became a successful portrait painter, and in 1825 was one of the founders of the Na- tional Academy of Design. His interest in science was re- vived in 1827 when he studied electromagnetism under J. F. Dana of Columbia College. He was still, however, in- terested primarily in painting and in 1829 returned to Europe to study the great works of art in the galleries of England, France, and Italy. On his return voyage to the United States aboard the packet ship Sully, he met Dr. Charles S. Jackson, who de- scribed to Morse a number of electrical experiments he had witnessed a short time before in Paris. These conversations with Dr. Jackson renewed Morse’s interest in electromag- netism, whereupon he confided to Dr. Jackson his latent ideas about an electric telegraph. He soon became com- pletely absorbed in the matter to the extent that he could think of nothing else. He worked out in considerable detail the design of an electromagnetic telegraph recorder, a mechanical sending device, a code of dots and dashes for numbers, and perhaps also a relay."},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 99 Before the Sully reached port, Morse had made rather complete sketches and notes on the recording telegraph he intended to construct. The Sully docked at the wharf at the foot of Rector Street in New York on November 15, 1832. As he disembarked, Morse was met by his two brothers, Sidney E. and Richard C. Morse. Because he was almost without funds at the time, his brother Richard invited him to live at his house until such time as he might again be- corne self-supporting. Morse’s brothers were the publishers of a newspaper, the New York Observer, and were appar- ently comfortably well-off. The telegraph that Morse had in mind at this time was designed to send and receive by mechanical means. In his sending apparatus he planned to use a form of type consist- ing of dots and dashes. He was given a room at his brother’s house where he began immediately to work on his tele- graph. Here he cast type and in the process damaged the furniture and carpets. His brother then gave him the use of a room of the fifth floor of the newspaper building, at the corner of Nassau and Beekman Streets. This room became his shop, studio, kitchen, living room, and bedroom. Here he worked, ate, slept, and lived in the direst poverty. It is not clear how his three children were cared for. They had been living with relatives since the death of their mother some years earlier. Morse labored on his telegraph in these quarters for some time and then moved to Greenwich Lane. Here he eked out a bare living by painting an occasional portrait and by giv- ing lessons, but his primary concern was with his telegraph, which began to take shape in a very crude form. His trans- mitting instrument was made with a wood frame on which was mounted a pair of wooden rollers, one of which was provided with a crank. A belt made of carpet binding"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"100 Chapter Eight passed over the rollers and carried the portrule, a sort of typesetter’s stick, in which the lead type was placed. A lever was mounted above the rollers on a pivot near its tenter, one end of which was provided with a rounded tooth that engaged the projections on the type as the portrule was carried forward. At the other end of the lever, a wire bent into the form of an arc was attached with its ends dipping into two mercury cups. The receiving apparatus of this first Morse telegraph was also built on a wood frame. It carried three wooden rollers, over which passed a strip of paper. One roller was driven by clockwork that moved the paper strip lengthwise. Over the middle roller was a pendulum whose swing was limited by two stops. On its lower end, it carried a pencil that was made to move crosswise of the paper strip under the in- fluence of an electromagnet. The circuit passed from one pole of the battery through the mercury cups, to the line, to the electromagnet and returned to the battery over the other side of the line. Impulses corresponding to the dots and dashes, set up in type on the portrule, were sent through the circuit, causing the pendulum to swing and causing the pencil at the lower end of the pendulum to draw an irregular sawtooth line. The mark on the paper could then be translated into dots and dashes and, by means of the code, into numbers. Morse’s code at this time was not alphabetical but contained only numbers, which could be translated into words by means of a dictionary. In 1835 Morse was appointed professor of the Literature of the Arts of Design at New York City University, and was assigned to quarters in the university building on Washing- ton Square. He moved his belongings to the new quarters, including, of course, his telegraph. Progress up to this time had been painfully slow, but"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 101 within a short time, perhaps with the help of Professor Page, he succeeded in getting his telegraph to operate, and late in 1835 was able to exhibit his invention to a group of friends. Professor Page was Charles Grafton Page, a native of Salem, Massachusetts, and a physician turned physicist and inventor. He contributed greatly to the development of the induction coil. He built several motors of the inter- mittent impulse type, one of which he used to operate a small locomotive. He was also the author of several books on induction. In 1836 Morse continued his work on the telegraph in order to improve its operation. He also experimented with recording by chemical means, a method that had previously been carried out by Dyar, and later by Bain, but Morse decided against it. Also during this period, Morse gave further thought to the matter of relays and in 1835 or 1836 designed such a device. DEMONSTRATION OF THE FIRST MORSE TELEGRAPH On Saturday, September 2, 1837, Morse exhibited his tele- graph, operating over 1700 feet of wire, to a group which included Professor Daubeny of Oxford University, Profes- sor L. D. Gale of New York City University, Professor Torrey, and Mr. Alfred Vail, who was a recent graduate of the university and whose family owned the Speedwell Iron Works of Speedwell, New Jersey. The Vail business in- cluded a brass and iron foundry and a machine shop.

He was convinced that the telegraph"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"102 Chapter Eight was practical and entered into a partnership agreement with Morse under which the Speedwell Iron Works would under- take the construction of an improved instrument.

GOVERNMENT INTERESTED IN TELEGRAPH On March 10, 1837, the secretary of the treasury, Levi Woodbury issued a circular letter to collectors of customs, commanders of revenue cutters, and other interested per- sons regarding a resolution passed by the House of Repre- sentatives, which requested information on a system of tele- graphs for the government of the United States. Morse, who had received a copy of the circular letter, sent a detailed description of his telegraph and its mode of operation to the secretary, dated September 27, 1837, and on Novem- ber 28, 1837 sent a second letter giving the secretary the results of the demonstration at New York City University in September. The Speedwell Iron Works was in the process of making an improved Morse telegraph, which was completed late in 1837 and was demonstrated in a room at the Speedwell shop on January 6, 1838, over a 3-mile circuit of insulated copper wire. It is not clear whether the new instrument used a fountain pen or merely a stylus to indent the paper, but both methods were used in Morse telegraph instru- ments. The new receiving instrument made four separate lines of dots and dashes on the paper, probably on the theory that at least one would be legible. The code in use was still the early one, using only numbers that were trans- lated into words by means of a specially prepared dic- tionary ."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 103 DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE IMPROVED MORSE TELEGRAPH The telegraph was now ready for a public demonstration, and such a demonstration was held before a large gathering in the Geological Cabinet of the University of the City of New York on January 24, 1838. Ten miles of wire were used in this test, and for the first time what is now known as the Morse code was employed. In other words, messages were composed of characters representing letters and not numbers. There is some evidence to indicate that Vail rather than Morse may have been responsible for this new telegraphic alphabet, although Morse was undoubtedly con- sulted in the matter. Whether or not the portrule for mechanical sending was still in use at this time cannot be determined definitely. Vail had improved the Morse tele- graph greatly and had t ransformed it from a crude working mode1 to an instrument that in appearance and per- formance was of commercial quality. A more important demonstration was given on Feb- ruary 8, 1838, before the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia, perhaps the foremost scientific body in the United States at the time. Its Science and Arts Committee was greatly im- pressed by what it saw. From Philadelphia, Morse took his telegraph to Washing- ton, where on February 21, 1838, President Van Buren and his cabinet witnessed the transmission of telegraphic messages over 10 miles of wire. Preceding this demon- stration, Morse had written a letter to F. 0. J. Smith, chair- man of the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives, in which he proposed building an under- ground line 100 miles long and offered the telegraph for the sole use of the government because he foresaw a possible misuse of the facility in private hands. After the demonstra-"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"104 Chapter Eight tion, Morse, in a second letter, reduced the suggested dis- tance to 50 miles and requested an appropriation of $26,000, excluding contingencies, to finance the construc- tion of an experimental line. Following Morse’s letter to Smith, the Commerce Com- mittee reported to the House of Representatives on the demonstration and recommended an appropriation of $30,000. Mr. Smith then decided that he would like to join the telegraph venture and offered to resign his position in Congress. A partnership was agreed upon between Morse and his associates in which sixteen shares were divided as follows: Morse nine shares, Smith four shares, Vail two shares, and Professor Gale one share. PATENT APPLICATIONS On April 7, 1838, Morse applied for a United States patent. The partners believed that foreign rights to the invention should be protected by patents as well as the rights at home, and accordingly Morse and Smith sailed for England on May 16, 1838. After spending seven weeks of frustrating effort with British officiais, they were refused a patent, partly on the grounds that a telegraph had already been patented by Wheatstone and Cooke, and partly because the claim was made that the details of Morse’s telegraph had already been published. Both arguments appear to have been insincere, and the truth was probably that the British government did not wish to have an American firm invade the British telegraph business. Although Morse was greatly disappointed in his efforts to obtain a British patent, he found pleasure in being able to attend the coronation of England’s great Queen Victoria as the guest of the Ameri- cari minister, Andrew Stevenson. Morse and Smith left England on July 26, 1838, on their way to Paris. In Paris Morse exhibited his telegraph to a"},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 105 distinguished gathering which included Arago, Baron Hum- boldt, Gay-Lussac, and others. In describing the apparatus exhibited in Paris, Morse again referred to the portrule, indicating that he had still not given up the idea of mechan- ical sending. Morse remained in Paris until March of the following year, during which time he exhibited his apparatus to many groups and individuals. There was at this time much politi- cal unrest in France involving King Louis Philippe, and as a result the patent application was delayed. He did, however, receive a patent eventually, but it had little value because of certain oddities in the French patent law, which provided that an actual installation must be made within two years. Since the telegraph was to be a government monopoly, and since the French government was not disposed to make the necessary expenditures, nothing came of the patent. While in Paris, Morse made application for a Russian patent through the Russian minister, Baron Meyendorf. Shortly thereafter, he returned to England and held further demonstrations before members of the House of Lords, af- ter which he sailed back to the United States aboard the steamer Great Western, which arrived in New York on April 15, 1839. Because Morse and his partners lacked funds and because Congress had not acted on the bill providing money for building an experimental line, there was little progress dur- ing the next several years. After more than two years a United States patent was issued to Morse on his telegraph on June 20, 1840. The delay was not SO much the fault of the patent office as it was Morse’s failure to supply a11 of the necessary information. There was no action by Con- gress on the appropriation bill during the sessions of 1840, 1841, and 1842."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"106 Chapter Eight SUBMARINE CABLE During this rather dismal period for Morse and his partners there was one interesting new development. Morse some- how got together enough money to have two miles of sub- marine table manufactured, which he laid between the Bat- tery and Governor’s Island in New York harbor in the summer of 1842. A test of this table was made on Oc- tober 19, 1842, during which four characters were received when transmission was suddenly interrupted. A ship’s anchor had fouled the table, and when it was drawn to the surface the ship’s crew tut it off because they had no idea as to its purpose. This table contained a single strand of copper wire, insulated with rubber and protected with spiral strands of tarred hemp. CONGRE% APPROPRIATES $30,000 FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL LINE On December 30, 1842, Charles G. Ferris, a member of the Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives, submitted a report on Morse’s telegraph together with a bill calling for the appropriation of $30,000 for the construc- tion of a telegraph line by Samuel F. B. Morse and his as- sociates. This bill passed the House on February 23, 1843, by a vote of eighty-nine to eighty-three. The Senate was preoccupied with many matters, but finally on the last day of the session, Marc11 3, 1843, just before midnight, the bill was approved by the Senate without opposition. Morse had been sitting in the gallery a11 day and into the evening, hoping that the telegraph bill would be called up. When he was told that there was no likelihood that the bill would be considered, he left the Senate Chamber with a heavy heart. He was informed of its passage early the next morning by"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 107 Miss Ellsworth, the daughter of the commissioner of pat- ents, who had become a friend of Morse. CONSTRUCTION OF THE LINE Morse and his partners were jubilant and began immedi- ately to make preparations for the construction of a tele- graph line between Washington and Baltimore, to be laid underground in lead pipe. Vail began the manufacture of new telegraph instruments. Professor L. D. Gale was put in charge of construction. Professor J. C. Fisher supervised the manufacture of the insulated wire, and Ezra Cornell, who had invented a machine for laying pipes underground, was put in charge of laying the lead pipe. It became evident after some miles of pipe had been laid that the underground system would not work. Apparently the difficulty lay in the fact that the joints in the pipe were being made with the insulated wire in place, and the heat used in splicing charred the insulating material and caused it to break down. The lead pipe was probably in short lengths, and no junction boxes were used. Two-thirds of the appropriation had been spent when the underground project was abandoned, but some of the ma- terials purchased could be salvaged. It was then decided to erect poles along the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad right-of- way. Morse referred to the poles as spars, and they were described as 30 feet high, probably the overall length. They were placed at intervals of 200 to 300 feet, a distance which was too great for the small-sized copper wire used. The wire was probably no larger than No. 14, and with these long spans there was difficulty later with the breaking of wires and of wires swinging together in high winds. Sufficient wire had been purchased to span four times the distance between Baltimore and Washington, but it is unlikely that"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"108 Chapter Eight a11 of the wire was used. The wire was attached to in- sulators, but there is no description of them. Later it was the practice on American telegraph lines to use glass in- sulators, whereas on European lines porcelain was used. In earlier experiments with the telegraph, Morse had used Cruikshank batteries, with which he experienced consider- able difficulty because of polarization, but on this project he turned to the Grove battery, which was expensive but did not polarize. On his latest European trip Morse had learned of the Daniel1 cell, which he admired greatly but which for some unknown reason he did not use on this line. Later a modification of the Daniel1 cell, known as the grav- ity cell, became the American standard for telegraph use. As the line progressed, constant testing was carried on from various points along the line to the terminal in Wash- ington. When the line reached the railway junction near Baltimore, a temporary station was established from which messages could be exchanged with Washington. Work had then been in progress for about a year, and it was decided that the line must be in operation by May 1, 1844, at which time the National Whig Convention was to meet in Balti- more. When Henry Clay was nominated for president by the Convention, the news was carried by messenger to the terminus of the then-existing line and sent to Washington by telegraph. Similarly, the nomination of Theodore Frelinghuysen for vice-president was sent to Washington. Shortly thereafter the telegraph circuit was completed to Mount Clare depot in Baltimore and to the Supreme Court building in Washington. “WHAT HATH GOD WROUGHT!” On May 24, 1844, the first officia1 test of the line was to be made. On the morning of that day Morse, his friends, and"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 109 other observers gathered about the instrument in the Su- preme Court building in Washington while Alfred VaiI was at the instrument in Baltimore. Morse had agreed to allow Miss Ellsworth to Select the message to be sent, as an acknowledgment of his gratitude for her service in bringing him the news of the passage by the Senate of the appropria- tion bill. Miss Ellsworth chose a short passage from the Book of Numbers in the Bible, “What hath God wrought!” The message was sent by Morse and received by Vail in Baltimore, who promptly repeated the message back to Washington. Morse was congratulated by his friends and soon by officia1 Washington as the news of his success spread. It is impossible to say precisely how the operation was carried out, but it seems clear that Morse had abandoned his portrule and had changed to some form of key. In de- scribing a later test, Mr. Holmes of South Carolina, a brother of a representative in Congress, described the opera- tion in a room beneath the Senate Chamber in these words, “saw him operate by dipping into a phial of quicksilver the end of one wire from the battery.” This method of operat- ing was very crude, but with the aid of Alfred Vail the telegraph key soon came into existence. After the first officia1 message on May 24, 1844, the Washington instrument was moved to the lower level of the Capitol in readiness for messages from Baltimore in connec- tion with the Democratic National Convention, which as- sembled there on May 26, 1844. After nominating James K. Polk for president, the Convention nominated Silas Wright, a senator from New York for the vice-presidency. Mr. Wright was not present at the Convention but had remained in Washington. When the news of his nomination was sent to Senator Wright by telegraph, he refused to accept it. His"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"110 Chapter Eight refusa1 was promptly sent back to Baltimore and an- nounced to the unbelieving delegates, who adjourned until the following morning in order to confirm the rejection, if such was indeed the case. The telegraphic message was con- firmed by Senator Wright, and thereafter the messages be- tween Baltimore and Washington were given full credence. COMMERCIAL OPERATION OF THE TELEGRAPH During the following year the telegraph operated without charge to its users. Expenses were covered by an appropria- tion by Congress of $8000, and the telegraph was placed under the supervision of the postmaster general. Alfred Vail became the operator at Washington, and H. J. Rogers at Baltimore. Beginning April 1, 1845, a charge was made of one cent for each four characters transmitted, but the revenue was insufficient to caver the cost of operation. Morse tried to interest the federal government in the con- struction of a telegraph line to New York, by way of Balti- more, Wilmington, Philadelphia, and Trenton, but he was unsuccessful. He then organized the Magnetic Telegraph Company, which was incorporated in Delaware on May 15, 1845, by special act of the legislature. It was the purpose of this company to build the line to New York. Its stock- holders were Morse, Gale, Vail, Ezra Cornell, and twenty- three others. On August 6, 1845, Morse again sailed for England, and again failed in his patent application. From England he went to Holland, where the Wheatstone telegraph was in use but was now equipped with electromagnets. Morse noted that on the line between Amsterdam and Haarlem, No. 12 iron wire was being used, which had a much greater tensile strength than the smaller copper wire on his Wash- ington-Baltimore line."},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph II 1 From Holland Morse went to Hamburg by steamer and then back to Paris, where he exhibited his telegraph before the French Chamber of Deputies on November 10,184s. CONSTRUCTION OF NEW TELEGRAPH LINES In 1846 Morse’s United States patent was reissued with improvements up to that time. Telegraph lines were now under construction in many directions, and in June 1846 the line between Washington and New York was completed. By 1847 a line was completed to St. Louis, and in 1848 one was constructed to Louisville and Nashville. The latter line was built by Henry O’Reilly and was soon involved in a patent suit brought by Morse, in which after some years of litigation, Morse was upheld by the United States Supreme Court. This was only one of many such suits that followed. WESTERN UNION By 1851 there were over fifty telegraph companies in the United States. The Western Union Telegraph Company was organized originally as the New York and Mississippi Valley Printing Telegraph Company on April 1, 1851, for the pur- pose of building a line from Buffalo to St. Louis. This com- pany bought progressively the lines and equipment of other smaller companies until after twenty years it had unified most of the entire telegraph system of the country. Many of the smaller telegraph companies had been in serious financial difficulties and were more than willing to sel1 their holdings to the larger and stronger Western Union. PRINTING TELEGRAPHS The original New York and Mississippi Valley Telegraph Company did not use the Morse telegraph but rather the House Printing Telegraph System, which had been devel- oped by Royal E. House of Vermont. This system, unlike"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"112 Chapter Eight the Morse recorder, printed the message in plain letters and numerals. Similar instruments using the so-called step-by- step method had been worked out by Cooke and Wheat- stone in England and improved by Stroh. These latter in- struments did not, however, print but merely showed the letters to the receiving operator, whereas House’s instru- ment printed the message on paper. The House system was first used on lines between boston and New York and be- tween New York and Philadelphia. It continued in use on certain lines until 1860 when it was replaced by the simpler Morse telegraph with key and sounder. The sounder was first used in 1858, much to the chagrin of Morse himself, whose operators had learned to read the messages coming into his recording machine by sound. In later years one of the stock tickers was devised on somewhat the same principle as the House printing tele- graph, but there were at least half a dozen stock tickers using various schemes. The key and sounder remained the standard on both American and European telegraphs for many years, but eventually the high-speed printer was developed and replaced the key and sounder altogether. RELAYS, DUPLEX AND MULTIPLEX SYSTEMS Many auxiliary devices and improvements were produced as the telegraph business grew. The relay, which Morse had invented at an early stage, was greatly improved and was made very sensitive. In order to reduce the capital invest- ment in lines, ways were sought to increase the capacity of the lines by speeding up the rate at which messages could be sent and by sending simultaneous messages over the same circuit. Gintl of Vienna was the first to invent a duplex telegraph in which a message could be sent in each"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"The Electric Telegraph 113 direction at the same time. This telegraph came in 1853, and was followed the next year by other duplex telegraphs by Frischen, and Siemens and Halske. None of these was very successful, and it was not until 1871 that J. B. Stearns invented a successful telegraph of this type. Many others had worked on the problem including Stark, Edlund, Preece, Nedden, Farmer, Maron, and Muirhead. In 1874 Edison invented his quadruplex telegraph, which made possible the sending of two simultaneous messages in each direction over the same circuit. The first multiplex system was invented by M. G. Farmer of Salem, Massachu- setts, in 1852, using a commutation method, but this device was not used until many years later, probably because of the difficulty in maintaining synchronism at the two ends of the line. A similar device was exhibited by Meyer at the Vienna Exposition in 1873. Harmonie telegraphs using tuning forks were invented by Elisha Gray, Edison, and Bell. RAILWAY TELEGRAPHS It is interesting to note that the development of the tele- graph and of the railroads took place at about the same time. In England the Wheatstone telegraph was used for train dispatching very early, probably before 1840. On American railways the use of the telegraph for this purpose did not occur until somewhat later, although Morse’s first line was built on a railroad right-of-way and the Baltimore instrument was in a railway station. Many of the later tele- graph lines were also built along railway lines, and the tele- graph office was often in the railway station. The railway telegraphs were usually independent of the commercial tele- graphs."},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"114 Chapter Eight THE FIRST TRANSCONTINENTAL TELEGRAPH LINE The New York and Mississippi Valley Telegraph Company changed its name to Western Union Telegraph Company on April 7, 1856. Its telegraph lines were spreading across the continent at an amazing rate. On October 24, 1861, the first transcontinental line was in service, an event which was of great importance to the federal government, because the Civil War was then in progress. It was almost eight years later, on May 10, 1869, that the first transcontinental rail- way line was completed. During the Civil War the telegraph played an important role in many campaigns, and this was the first major war in which either the telegraph or the railroad was used. ELECTRICAL MANUFACTURING The telegraph was the first electrical industry, and it brought with it the organization of numerous manufactur- ing concerns producing telegraph instruments, relays, line wire, insulated magnet wire, table, poles, cross arms, in- sulators, pins, lightning arrestors, linemen’s tools, and vari- ous other items. These industries grew to considerable size, and were in some cases the predecessors of companies that later produced dynamos, lighting equipment, and telephone supplies."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"9 The Atlantic Cable EARLY SUBMARINE CABLES Submarine tables were not new at the time the earliest attempts at laying an Atlantic table were made. Morse had laid a 2-mile submarine table in New York harbor in 1842. In 1845, between Fort Lee and New York City, Ezra Cor- ne11 laid a table 12 miles long, which contained two copper wires insulated with cotton and India rubber and protected by a lead sheath. This table operated several months but was destroyed by ice. In 1849 a British company undertook the laying of a tele- graph table between Dover and Calais, but this table failed because the insulation consisted merely of tarred hemp, which could not withstand the penetration of seawater. The following year a new table insulated with gutta-percha was manufactured in England and was laid across the channel in six or seven hours by two small steamers. This table, how- ever, soon failed due to mechanical stress. Still another table was manufactured containing four wires, each insu- lated with gutta-percha and overlaid with hemp tords soaked in tar and tallow and protected against abrasion by an iron wire armor. This table, laid in 1851, operated suc- cessfully. In late May 1852, England and Ireland were connected by table, and a year later there was a table between Scotland and Ireland. In June 1853 a telegraph table was laid between Oxfordness in England and The Hague in Hol- land, a distance of 115 miles, the longest table SO far. NEWFOUNDLAND CABLE As early as 1849 or 1850, F. N. Gisborne, an English en- gineer who had previously been in charge of the construc-"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"116 Chapter Ybine tion of telegraph lines in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, proposed, to the Newfoundland House of Assembly, the construction of a telegraph line from St. John’s in New- foundland to the mainland. This line would cons& of over- land portions about 400 miles in length and an undersea portion of 85 miles. The route was to extend from St. John’s to Cape Ray, from Cape Ray to Cape Breton by submarine table, and across Cape Breton Island to the mainland of Nova Scotia, where connections could be made with existing telegraph lines. When Gisborne surveyed the rugged terrain in Newfound- land, he decided that it would be necessary to put the line underground, and thereby also avoid the difficulties in maintaining the line under adverse weather conditions. Ile had been granted &500 by the Newfoundland House of As- sembly for the survey and raised sufficient funds from other sources to begin construction. Ile had completed only 30 to 40 miles of the line when his funds were tut off and construction was halted. It was necessary to obtain new capital from other sources, and therefore, in 1854 he went to New York where he met Matthew D. Field, a civil engineer, who had been engaged in building railroads and bridges. Field became interested and called in his brother Cyrus CV. Field, who had retired the previous year from a successful business as a New York merchant and who, although only thirty-four years old, had acquired a substantial fortune. Cyrus Field invited Gisborne to his home to discuss the matter of the Newfoundland line, but Field soon had wider visions including a submarine table across the Atlantic. He arranged a meeting with Samuel Morse, who had long cher- ished the notion that communication by telegraph under the oceans was possible. In a letter to F. 0. J. Smith dated"},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"The Atlantic Gable 117 March 2, 1839, written in Paris, Morse said, “1 see now that a11 physical obstacles which may for a while hinder, Will inevitahly be overcome; the problem is solved; man may instantly converse with his fellow man in any part of the world.” THE ATLANTIC CABLE Both Field and Morse became enthusiastic over the possi- bility of establishing telegraphic communication with En- gland. Field set about raising the necessary capital immedi- ately. He organized a company of six partners called the New York, Newfoundland, and London Telegraph Com- pany. The original partners were Cyrus Field, David Dudley Field, an attorney and brother of Cyrus, Peter Cooper, Moses Taylor, M. 0. Roberts, and Chandler White. Later, after a charter had been granted by the Newfoundland House of Assembly, the names of Samuel Morse, Robert W. Lowber, Wilson G. Hunt, and John W. Brett were added to the list of partners. The new company acquired the Gis- borne properties. In the fa11 of 1854, Field went to England to order table for the 85-mile Cabot Strait crossing, between Cape Ray and Cape Breton. When the Cabot Strait table was de- livered, it was loaded aboard a small sailing vesse1 that en- countered a severe storm and foundered, with the loss of a11 of the table on board. A second attempt was successful, and the necessary land lines were completed, SO that by 1856 communication was established between St. John’s in Newfoundland and New York. The very difficult task of laying a table on the little- known ocean floor was now to begin. The first step was to take soundings to determine the most feasible route. Both the British and the American governments were deeply"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"118 Chapter Nine interested in the project, and each authorized its navy to undertake soundings. For the British navy, Lieutenant Commander Joseph Dayman was in charge, and for the United States Navy, Lieutenant Berryman. Berryman, sailing east, followed the great circle route out of Trinity Bay, Newfoundland, and Dayman followed a westward route out of Valentia in Ireland. Both found the existence of a great plateau, which received the name of Telegraph Plateau. The greatest depth encountered on the plateau was 2400 fathoms, and there appeared to be no serious prob- lems in the way of laying a submarine table. CABLE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED On September 26, 1856, the Atlantic Telegraph Company was incorporated in England by Charles Bright, John Brett, and Cyrus Field, with an initial capital of &350,000. There is no further mention of Gisborne’s original company, the Newfoundland Electric Telegraph Company incorporated in 1852, or the New York, Newfoundland, and London Tele- graph Company organized in 1854. It may be assumed that the useful assets of these companies were transferred to the new company and that they were then dissolved. Gisborne’s name does not again appear in connection with the table companies, but apparently he remained active in the Cana- dian telegraph business, for in 1879 he was appointed su- perintendent of the Canadian government telegraph and signal service. Field had left New York bound for England on July 19, 1856, to arrange for the manufacture of table and to con- sult with his British partners regarding other steps that might be required for the table project. With the or- ganization of the new company, control passed from American to British hands, but this change was probably"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"The Atlantic Cahle 119 for the good of the undertaking because more British cap- ital was available, the table manufacturing companies were in England, and the British government was willing to sub- sidize the project with money and with ships. The United States Congress later also voted to render assistance. CONTRACTS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF CABLE Early in 1857 the manufacture of 2500 miles of table was begun by two British firms, Glass Elliot and Company of London and R. S. Newall and Company of Birkenhead, near Liverpool. The specifications for the table called for a conductor composed of seven strands of No. 22 copper wire covered by three layers of gutta-percha. This portion of the table was furnished by the Gutta-percha Company, after which it was sent to the two table companies. At the table works the inner tore was wrapped with hemp tord that had been treated with tar and other compounds. Next, the outer armor was applied which consisted of eighteen, seven-strand No. 22 iron wires. The outside diameter of the completed table was a little more than 5/s inch, and it weighed approximately 2000 pounds per mile. In addition to the submarine table, some 25 miles of land table for the shore ends were manufactured. This table was nine times the weight per mile of the main table, and was more heavily armored to protect against abrasion on the rocky shores. The main table had been made in 2-mile lengths that were later spliced. Technical consultants for the Atlantic Cable Company in- cluded William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) of Glasgow, Michael Faraday, and Samuel Morse. The board of directors was made up of the three organizers, Brett, Bright, and Field, a number of British bankers and businessmen, and later Lord Kelvin. Dr. Wildman Whitehouse, a doctor of I"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"120 Chapter kine medicine, whose interests had turned to electrical pursuits, was engaged by the company to take charge of testing and other technical matters, and unfortunately he was the supe- rior of the very able consultants who had far more knowl- edge of telegraph problems. THE CABLE FLEET The United States Navy assigned the steam frigate Niagara of 5200 tons to the table-laying project, accompanied by the side-wheeler Susquehanna, and the British navy fur- nished the Agamemnon of 3200 tons, accompanied by the paddle-wheel steamer Leopard. Bot11 the Niagara and the Agamemnon had been specially equipped with tanks in their holds for storing the table, and with table-laying ma- chinery on their decks, including drums, guide wheels, brakes, dynamometers, and steam engines. On April 21, 1857, the Niagara sailed from New York with Samuel Morse on board. Morse no longer had any financial interest in the Atlantic table but had an intense persona1 interest. After his arriva1 in England, Morse went ashore to renew old friendships. LOADING AND TESTING THE CABLE The manufacture of the table was completed in June, but loading aboard the two ships was not finished until late July. The Agamemnon, because of its lighter draft, loaded its table at the Glass-Elliot works on the Thames, and the Niagara took its cargo aboard at the Newall works at Bir- kenhead, where there was deeper water. Before going on to Valentia in Ireland, where table-laying was to begin, the ships met in the quiet water of the Cove of Cork near Queenstown in order to make a final test of the table. Considering the fact that the table had been"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Atlantic Gable 121"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"122 Chapter 1Vine made in 2-mile lengths and spliced, such a test was very necessary. It was this matter of splicing which probably accounted for much of the delay in loading. When the ends of the table aboard the two ships were joined and a battery and galvanometer connected, it was found that the table was continuous and the insulation was good. The sluggish behavior of a long table, due to its capacity, was already known and was confirmed by these tests, in which three- quarters of a second was required for a signal to traverse the 2500 miles of table. From the Cove of Cork the ships sailed toward Valentia on the southwest toast of Ireland, where they arrived at three o’clock on the afternoon of August 4, 1857. By August 6 the land portion of the table had been placed and secured. LAYING THE CABLE It was agreed that the Niagara would begin laying its table, and in mid-ocean a splice would be made with the table on the Agamemnon, which would then continue the laying to the Newfoundland terminus. The ships moved out on the morning of August 6, but after only 5 miles of table had been laid it caught in the machinery on deck and snapped. The broken table end was retrieved in comparatively shal- low water and spliced. After a delay of less than a day the convoy again moved westward toward Newfoundland. During the laying, communication was maintained with the station at Valentia in order to keep a constant check on the condition of the table. At one point contact was lost for a period of 2% heurs but then resumed. After moving westward for two days, the ocean depth had reached 2000 fathoms and the strain on the table had increased proportionately, as this great length of table dangled into"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The Atlantic Cable 123 the depths of the ocean. It was necessary to keep the table taut as it passed over the sheave at the Stern of the ship, in order to prevent the weight of the table alone from pulling it out SO rapidly as to deposit it in coils on the ocean floor. Early in the morning of August 11, 1857, the engineer in charge of the drums that paid out the table found that it was moving out too fast and applied the brake, which grabbed SO quickly that the table broke. At that time 335 miles of table had been laid, and there was nothing to be done but to return to England. Both ships put ashore at Plymouth and unloaded their table. At this time the tech- nique of grappling the table on the ocean floor had not yet been perfected, SO that in this instance the table already laid was abandoned. PROJECT POSTPONED UNTIL THE FOLLOWING YEAR Th ’ e project was given up for the year 1857, but plans were immediately made to continue the project the following year. First of all, 700 miles of new table were ordered, and substantial improvements were made in the deck machinery for paying out the table. At this time Thomson developed his marine galvanometer that was to play such an important role in receiving table messages. With this device it was possible to receive twenty words a minute, or ten times the number previously received. Thomson5 galvanometer was very sensitive and consisted of a delicately suspended, short, steel magnet, placed inside a coi1 of fine, insulated, copper wire. Just above the movable magnet, a small mirror was mounted which reflected a beam of light on a scale placed some distance in front of it. Behind the scale was a lamp the light from which passed through a small opening in the scale to the mirror on the instrument. The reflected"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"124 Char)ter \\tine Figure 9.2 Thomson’s Marine Galvanometer (Courtesy Burndy Library) spot of light from the lamp appeared on the scale where the deflection could be read. It was then decided that on the next attempt at laying the table, the ships would meet in mid-ocean and proceed in opposite directions after making a splice. The winter months of 1857-1858 were devoted to fitting the ships with the new deck machinery, improving the table tanks in the holds, instructing the crews, and in general making use of experience ah-eady gained."},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Atlantic Gable 125 SECOND ATTEMPT In the spring of 1858, the ships arrived at Plymouth to take aboard the table deposited there the previous year and in addition the 700 miles of new table. Loading was com- pleted about the middle of May, and on May 29, 1858, the ships sailed out of Plymouth harbor to the Bay of Biscay, where various experiments and tests were conducted in table-laying, buoying, and splicing. On June 3, 1858, the ships returned to Plymouth harbor, and a week later sailed out for their mid-ocean rendezvous, where table-laying was to begin. Besides the Niagara and the Agumemnon, the sup- porting vessels, the Vulorous and the Gorgon of the British navy, made up the table-laying fleet. By the time the vessels were out on the high seas the greatest storm in the North Atlantic, in the memory of the experienced seamen aboard the ships, broke upon the four vessels. The high seas were particularly hazardous for the Agumemnon because she carried a deck load of table for which there was no room in the hold. After several days the storm abated, and the ships proceeded to their rendezvous without serious damage. When the ships met in mid-ocean on June 25 the weather was calm and a11 was in readiness. CABLE IS SPLICED IN MID-OCEAN On the following day the tables on the two ships were spliced and the joint lowered into the sea. The ships now moved apart; the Agumemnon toward Ireland, and the Niagara toward Newfoundland. After only 3 miles of table had been laid, the table on the Niagara caught in the deck machinery and snapped. The ships returned to their starting point, spliced the table once again, and once more set out toward their respective destinations. On June 27, when the ships were 80 miles apart, the circuit was interrupted by"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"126 Chapter Nine what was found to be two breaks in the insulation. Once more the ships returned to the starting point, and again the table was spliced. Al1 went well until June 29 when the table broke about 20 feet from the Stern of the Agumem- non. About 300 miles of table was lost, but there still re- mained a sufficient length to complete the line between the two terminals. The table fleet turned back and arrived at Queenstown early in July, where the vessels were refueled and loaded with a new stock of provisions. On July 17 the fleet sailed out once again toward the mid-Atlantic. Splicing of the tables was completed on July 29, after which the ships set out for Newfoundland and Ireland. This time only minor difficulties were encountered, and the table-laying was completed on August 5 by both ships. When the news of the successful table-landing was telegraphed to New York and from New York to a11 parts of the nation, cele- brations were held everywhere. INSULATION BREAKS DOWN This table continued to operate only until September 1, during which time less than four hundred messages had been transmitted. Various explanations were offered for the failure of the table. Undoubtedly the insulation had broken down, and some held that the fault lay with the manufac- turers, some believed the insulation was injured by expo- sure to sun and weather while it was stored at Plymouth, and others attributed the damage to the fact that Dr. White- house, in testing, had applied high voltage from an induc- tion coi1 to the table. The clouds of civil war were already hovering over the United States. Cyrus Field’s persona1 fortune was wiped out in a fire in 1859 and a business depression in 1860. In the interim the Atlantic table management had learned much from the failures, as had also the table manufacturers."},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Atlantic Gable 127 THE SECOND CABLE No further attempts were made to lay another table until the end of the Civil War in the United States. When work was resumed in 1865, a single vesse1 was employed, the British-owned Great Eustern, the largest vesse1 in the world. The new table was much improved over those used in the 1857 and 1858 attempts. Among other modifications the conductor was increased in size to seven strands of No. 18 copper wire, with nearly three times the cross section of the earlier table conductors. Four layers of gutta-percha were used instead of three, and the outer armor of stranded iron wires, of which there were ten, was covered with tarred hemp. The Great Eastern was equipped with three iron-plate tanks for storing the table and with much-improved paying- out machinery on deck. Below deck was an electrician’s room in the charge of Mr. de Sauty, which was equipped with batteries, Thomson’s marine galvanometer, clock, log- books, and such other paraphernalia as would be required. Among those on board to render technical assistance were William Thomson, C. F. Varley, and Cyrus Field. MOST OF THE CABLE IS LAID SUCCESSFLJLLY BEFORE IT BREAKS Early in July 1865 the table was loaded aboard the Grear Eastern, which then proceeded to the new terminus about 6 miles distant from the former landing place at Valentia. About 30 miles of shore table had already been placed by the Caroline, and attached to a buoy in the harbor. When the Great Eastern arrived, the splice was made to the shore table, and on July 23 she and two accompanying warships of the British navy steamed out of the harbor toward their destination at St. John’s, Newfoundland. There were only"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"128 Chapter hine minor difficulties until a point some 600 miles east of New- foundland had been reached. At that time a fault developed in the table after it had passed over the Stern of the ship, and an attempt was made to pull it back. As it was being pulled back the table broke and efforts to retrieve it were unavailing. Although the table had been grappled three times, in each case either the grappling table or some of its attachments had failed. Further efforts to retrieve the table were abandoned and the ships returned to England. There was of course great disappointment in the minds of a11 who were connected with the project as well as in the general public. Because of the many failures it became in- creasingly difficult to raise capital for the table enterprise. A new company called the Anglo-American Telegraph Com- pany was formed at this time, but it is not entirely clear whether this company was a reorganization of the Atlantic Telegraph Company or merely a holding company to ar- range the necessary finances. In any case a new table was ordered and made ready. This table again differed some- what from the earlier ones in that it was stronger, and the armor was made of galvanized wire. THE THIRD CABLE The new table was aboard the Great Eastern by the end of June 1866. Two additional ships, the Albany and the Med- way were chartered by the company to accompany the Great Eastern. The Medway carried what was left of the 1865 table in addition to 90 miles of heavier shore table. It was about July 12, 1866, after the shore table had been laid, that the convoy began its westward journey. Every- thing worked smoothly until the sixth day out when the table became badly fouled in the after tank. The ship was stopped quickly, and after several heurs the snarl was dis-"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Atlantic Cable 129 entangled. No further mishaps occurred, and the table was safely landed in a small inlet in Trinity Bay, where there was a tiny village called Heart’s Content. The landing of the table occurred on July 28, 1866, but the work of the ex- pedition was not yet finished. After a brief rest the ships again steamed out into the Atlantic to recover the end of the 1865 table, a task which was accomplished on Au- gust 31. A splice was made, and the second table was brought ashore on September 7. There were now two tables in good operating condition. Commercial service on the tables was begun soon after the first table was brought ashore, using the Thomson marine galvanometer. Reading the messages received by this instru- ment was necessarily slow, because it depended entirely on observing the deflections of the spot of light on the scale, to the right and to the left. At first the rate of transmission was only eight words per minute, but this rate soon in- creased to sixteen or seventeen. There was great need for a recording device, but the difficulty lay in the very feeble currents that could be transmitted over the table. In order to trace a record of the message on paper a frictionless pen was needed. THE SIPHON RECORDER In 1867 Thomson, then Sir William Thomson, obtained a patent on what was called the siphon recorder, which was a very different instrument from his mirror galvanometer. In- stead of a stationary coil, a very light movable coi1 was suspended by means of metallic torsion wires between the poles of a strong permanent magnet. Connected to the coi1 was a small glass siphon tube, one end of which dipped into a bottle of ink and the other end, drawn out to a fine capillary tube, was held a short distance above a brass plate,"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"130 Chapter Rine over which passed the paper strip on which the message was recorded. The ink bottle was insulated and was kept charged by an electrostatic machine. As the coi1 moved to and fro, under the influence of the currents from the table, carrying with it the siphon tube, tiny drops of ink were deposited on the paper in the form of a wavy line, pulled out by electrostatic attraction. The record was very similar to that in Morse’s original recording telegraph. There was nothing new in the moving coi1 principle since it had been applied earlier by Weber and d’Arsonva1. The siphon recorder with improve- ments and modifications became the standard receiving device for table messages, and was used for many years. At first the charge for a message between New York and London was five dollars per Word, but as the speed of trans- mission increased and experience was gained in the opera- tion of the table, the cost was reduced until at the present time such a message costs in the neighborhood of twelve to twenty-three cents per Word, depending on the kind of ser- vice."},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"10 The Telephone BOURSEUL AND REIS In the August 26, 1854, issue of L>Illustration of Paris there appeared an article, written by Charles Bourseul, on the electrical transmission of speech. Bourseul did not claim that he had built an apparatus such as he described. The de- vice that he envisioned had a transmitter consisting of a stretched membrane, to which was attached a metallic con- tact at its tenter. When the membrane was caused to vibrate by a sound, its contact would open and close a circuit througb a fixed contact in close proximity to the first. The circuit was completed through a battery and a receiver. The receiver consisted of an electromagnet whose poles were very close to a thin iron diaphragm. Johann Philipp Reis, professor of physics at Friedrichs- dorf, Germany, delivered a lecture in 1861 before the Physical Society of Frankfurt in which he described an in- strument he had built, which he called the telephone, and which he said would reproduce sounds. Reis’s telephone was essentially the same type of instrument described by Bourseul except that the receiver was a knitting needle, wound with fine wire, and attached to a light wood box which acted as a resonator. Reis himself said that he had been unable to reproduce human speech sufficiently dis- tinctly to be intelligible. Others claimed that the instrument would transmit speech, and considered Reis the inventor of the telephone. Reis and others who worked on this problem apparently did not realize that in order to reproduce speech it was necessary to do more than open and close a circuit very rapidly, but rather that the electric current had to be modu- lated SO as to correspond as closely as possible with the"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"132 Chapter Ten Figure 10.1 Reis’s Telephone (Courtesy Burndy Library) complex wave form as well as the volume of the impressed sounds. Helmholtz had shown that the quality of a sound was due to a combination of tones and not to a single pure tone. The Reis transmitter was incapable of transmitting the complex combination of tones that give the human voice or a musical instrument its quality. Furthermore, the Reis instrument could not reproduce the variations in loud- ness. At best such a transmitter might reproduce a pure tone, but more often the effect on the receiver was merely a rattle. ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL It is generally acknowledged that Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) was the inventor of the telephone, but there"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Telephone 133 were numerous contributions by others. Bell was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on March 3, 1%7, to Alexander Mel- ville Bell and his wife Eliza Grace (Symonds). Besides Alex- ander there were two brothers, Melville James, who was older, and Edward Charles, who was younger than Alex- ander. The father had achieved recognition as a teacher of correc- tive speech and elocution, and also as a lecturer at the University of Edinburgh and at New College. He and his brother published a book in 1860, called Z’he Standard Elocutionist, which eventually ran through several hundred editions. Alexander and his two brothers received their early educa- tion from their mother, including lessons in music. At the age of ten Alexander entered a private school in Edinburgh, where he remained for a year, after which he attended the Royal High School, f rom which he graduated at the age of fourteen. After graduation Alexander spent a year with his grandfather in London, who taught him something of the gracious living of a gentleman and encouraged him in the study of speech and acoustics. Alexander, at this time, had ambitions to become a concert pianist, after having studied the piano in Edinburgh under the tutelage of Signor Au- guste Benoit Bertini, but his grandfather discouraged this idea. When he returned to Edinburgh, Alexander began a more serious study of his father’s speech methods and particu- larly of the applications of Visible Speech, which was a method of producing the various speech sounds by means of ten basic symbols involving the positions of the tongue and lips. Combinations of these symbols could produce any speech sound in any language. At the age of sixteen Alexander became a pupil-teacher at"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"134 Chapter Ten a school in Elgin. The following summer he studied Greek and Latin at the University of Edinburgh. When he was seventeen he returned to Elgin, where he taught elocution and music at Weston House Academy. Grandfather Alexander Bell died in London in 1864 or 1865, after which event Bell’s father moved to London, leaving his eldest son Melville James in charge of his pupils in Edinburgh. While Alexander was still at Elgin, he wrote a long letter to his father describing some experiments he had conducted with tuning forks, electromagnets, and resona- tors, in complete ignorance of the experiments of Helm- holtz. The elder Bell became well known in London, and his speech methods were in demand. He was made professor of elocution at the University of London, and altogether had achieved considerable success. In 1868 he was invited to lecture at Lowell Institute in Boston, which invitation he accepted. Alexander, his son, now twenty-one years of age, was left in charge of the London classes, lectures, and les- sons. THE BELL FAMILY MOVES TO CANADA In 1870 the older brother, Melville James, died of tubercu- losis, a disease which earlier had taken the younger brother. Alexander was given a medical examination that disclosed that he too was in some danger. The father, now thor- oughly alarmed, decided to abandon bis successful London career and to move to Canada. They settled near Brantford, Ontario, where Alexander soon recovered his health, and resumed his experiments with tuning forks and electromag- nets. CLASSES IN BOSTON In 1871 Alexander was asked to corne to Boston to work with the pupils at the School for the Deaf, using his father’s"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Telephone 135 method of Visible Speech. After a time he returned to Brantford, but in 1872 he went once more to Boston where he opened a School for Vocal Physiology. Among his pupils was Mabel Hubbard, the daughter of Gardiner Greene Hub- bard, a prominent Boston attorney. Mabel had become deaf at the age of four and one-half years after an attack of scarlet fever, and had been sent to Germany to learn lip- reading. THE HARMONIC TELEGRAPH From his tuning-fork experiments Bell had conceived the idea of applying the principles he had developed to a device he called his harmonie telegraph. In general the principle of the harmonie telegraph lay in the use of various frequen- cies, which could be sent over a telegraph line simultane- ously and received on separate instruments, each of which was tuned to receive only a single frequency. During the winter of 1872-1873 he carried on a series of experiments with such an apparatus, but he became il1 and returned to Brantford in May to recover his health. BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND GEORGE SANDERS He did not return to Boston until October 1873 at which time he was appointed professor of vocal physiology in the School of Oratory of Boston University, but despite the new activity he continued his private lessons. At that time also, he became the tutor of a small boy named George Sanders, who lived with his grandmother in a spacious house in Salem. The boy, whose father was Thomas Sanders, had been born deaf. Thomas Sanders was a well- to-do leather merchant in Boston, and was to become Bell’s most important supporter, together with Gardiner Greene"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"136 Chapter Ten Hubbard. Bell was asked to live at the Sanders home in Salem, where he was given ample room for his experimental equipment. He commuted to Boston by train each day and devoted his evenings to teaching the Sanders boy, and after the boy had gone to bed he spent the remaining hours working on his harmonie telegraph. A fine friendship devel- oped between Bell, the Sanders, and the Sanders boy. THOMAS A. WATSON Bell was still a British subject at this time and believed that on this account he would be unable to apply for a United States patent. He felt that his harmonie telegraph had reached the stage of development at which it was patent- able, but his efforts to secure a British patent at this time were unsuccessful. His models of the harmonie telegraph were rather crude, and he felt that it was necessary to construct a more work- manlike device. T O this end he engaged the services of the Charles Williams shop at 109 Court Street, in Boston. It was here that he first met Thomas A. Watson, a Williams em- ployee, who was to become his assistant and lifetime friend. Watson served Bell in much the same way that Alfred Vail had served Morse. The year was 1874. Bell was twenty- seven years of age and Watson was twenty. THE PHONAUTOGRAPH AND THE REIS TELEPHONE Although Bell’s primary interest at this time was in the harmonie telegraph, his mind was still occupied with im- proving his methods of teaching the deaf to speak. He per- formed experiments with a form of phonautograph, a recent development at the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- nology. This instrument traced the form of a sound wave"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Telephone 137 on a glass plate coated with lampblack. While conducting these experiments at the Institute, he saw there for the first time a reproduction of the Reis telephone. Whether or not he was influenced in his thinking by this mode1 is not known. From his experiments with the phonautograph, the har- monic telegraph, and even some experiments with human ears obtained from the Harvard Medical School, he gradu- ally evolved the idea of transmitting speech electrically. He knew already that to transmit sounds accurately it would be necessary to produce an undulating current which would follow exactly the complicated waveform of the sound, and that a make-and-break current would not do. These ideas were further developed during a visit to the family home in Brantford in the summer of 1874. Upon his return to Boston, Bell described his ideas con- cerning the telephone to Sanders in some detail. Sanders shared Bell’s enthusiasm, but Hubbard was not at a11 ex- cited and wanted Bell to get on with his harmonie tele- graph, which he had helped to finance. Bell was now deter- mined to pursue his experiments with renewed vigor, and to that end took over the top floor of the building in which the Williams shop was located. Bell and Watson worked feverishly during the evenings and at such other times as they might be free from other duties. In 1875 Bell received a United States patent on his har- monic telegraph, a device on which Elisha Gray of Chicago had also been working. Gray was the chief electrician of the Western Electric Manufacturing Company, which at that time produced telegraph equipment and related electrical apparatus for the Western Union Telegraph Company. Gray and Bell were both working on very similar ideas, but Gray had a great advantage over Bell because of his connections"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"138 Chapter Ten with the Western Electric Manufacturing Company, the largest producer of electrical apparatus in the United States. MEETING WITH JOSEPH HENRY While Bell was in Washington to obtain his patent on the harmonie telegraph, he met Joseph Henry, the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution who had been the mentor of SO many experimenters in electricity, including Morse. Bell mentioned his ideas for the telephone to Henry, but ex- plained that his knowledge of electricity was too meager for the problems involved, whereupon Henry advised him to get the knowledge he needed. The Western Union Telegraph Company showed an inter- est in the harmonie telegraph and offered the use of its facilities in New York for further development, but Bell declined the offer. Neither Bell’s nor Elisha Gray’s har- monic telegraph was developed commercially. AGREEMENT WITH SANDERS AND HUBBARD Early in 1875 Bell entered into an agreement with Sanders and Hubhard under which they were to contribute one-half each of the expenses Bell would incur in the development of his telegraph apparatus. No mention was made of any compensation for Bell’s time and his living expenses. Bell believed that this agreement covered his work on the tele- phone as well as the harmonie telegraph, although it ap- peared later that the other two men who were parties to the agreement thought it covered only the telegraph. Bell’s income from teaching dwindled rapidly as he gave more and more time to his experiments, with the result that he was reduced to great poverty. He had hoped for the sale of his harmonie telegraph to the Western Union Telegraph Company, but in this, as in other things, he was disap-"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"The Telephone 139 pointed. His spirits had fallen to a very low ebb, but with Watson’s encouragement they worked long hours to im- prove the harmonie telegraph and a new device, the auto- graph-telegraph, as Bell called it, or the telautograph, as it was known later. BELL% GREAT DISCOVERY After much fruitless work in April and May 1875, there occurred on June 2, 1875, one of those fortunate accidents that SO often have resulted in great discoveries. Bell and Watson were at work on the harmonie telegraph in the attic of the Williams shop with Watson plucking the steel reeds on the transmitter, and Bell tuning the corresponding reeds on the receiver, when Bell became suddenly excited over what he had heard. He ran to Watson to find out what Watson had done. The contacts on one of the reeds of the transmitter had been welded together by the arc SO that they failed to open, and when Watson plucked the reed an induced current was produced in the circuit, because the electromagnet under the reed was energized, and an undu- lating current was produced by electromagnetic induction. This induced current caused the receiving reed to give off a sound unlike that produced when the circuit was made or broken through the contacts. Bell recognized at once that he had discovered the means of producing the undulating current needed to transmit speech. Bell made a sketch for Watson showing the details of a new apparatus he wanted Watson to build, and by the next day his first telephone was ready. It consisted of two iden- tical instruments, each of which had a membrane of gold- beaters’ skin stretched over an opening in a box on the back of which rested a button attached to a hinged iron or steel arm. This arm formed part of a magnetic circuit with a"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"140 Char)ter l’en small gap between it and one pole of an electromagnet. The electrical circuit for the two instruments was completed through a battery to energize the electromagnets. After the Williams shop had closed for the day, the first tests were carried out between the attic and the first floor of the shop over a pair of wires that Watson had strung. Bell had been unable to hear Watson, but almost immediately Watson came running up the stairs exclaiming, “1 could hear your voice; 1 could almost make out what you said.” Throughout the mont11 of June, Watson made one instru- ment after another according to the sketches which Bell prepared, as he sought to make an instrument that would transmit the human voice clearly and distinctly. Bell felt elated by his meager success, but Hubbard was unimpressed and wanted Bell to Perfect his harmonie tele- graph and his autograph-telegraph, which in his opinion, were far more likely to produce tangible results and finan- cial returns. Sanders, on the other hand, believed in Bell’s ability to make something of real value out of the present flood of confused ideas and projects. DESPAIR The summer of 1875 was a wretched one for Bell because in addition to his lack of funds he was in love with Mabel Hubbard, his former pupil. Hubbard was rather put out with him, and his parents disapproved of his neglect of his speech classes. With these burdens pressing in upon him he again fell ill, and once more sought to recuperate at his parents’ home in Brantford. As his health returned, his chief concern was the condition of his finances, but he felt that he could not or would not ask Hubbard or Sanders for more assistance. His thoughts turned to some of his father’s wealthier neighbors. He caïled upon George Brown who"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"The Telephone 141 became interested in Bell% telephone, with the result that he and his brother Gordon Brown agreed to lend Bell the money he needed on the condition that they would be entitled to any foreign patents they might obtain, and that Bell was not to file for a United States patent until such foreign patents, especially the British patent, had been filed, and that Bell would prepare the necessary patent specifications as soon as possible. Bell returned to Boston and the patent specifications were soon ready, but the written agreement and the money from the Browns did not arrive. Things were getting SO desperate that Bell was compelled to return to his teaching in order to live, but he still stood by his agreement not to file for a United States patent until the British patent papers had been filed. The year 1875 slipped away, and there was still no word from the Browns. Hubbard and Sanders urged Bell to file his patent application regardless of his verbal agree- ment with the Browns. On November 25, 1875, Bell and Mabel Hubbard became engaged, and as the prospective son-in-law of Hubbard his relations with that gentleman improved. Bell arranged to meet the Browns at Toronto after Christ- mas, and on December 29 an agreement was concluded under which each of the Browns was to pay Bell twenty- five dollars a month for six months for a half interest in any foreign patents they might obtain. Bell was working on improving the language of his specifi- cations. One very important modification later saved his patent, namely a clause having to do with a variable resis- tance, presumably in a transmitter. George Brown finally sailed for England on January 25, 1876, and Bell as well as Hubbard were in New York to see him off. They waited two weeks, during which time there"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"142 ChapterTen was no word that the British patent application had been filed. Hubbard’s patience had run out, and, without the consent of Bell, he filed for a United States patent on Feb- ruary 14, 1876. It was none too soon, for only a few heurs later Elisha Gray filed a caveat with the Patent Office on an almost identical invention. NEW QUARTERS At this time Bell moved his equipment from the top floor of the Williams shop building to his living quarters at 5 Exeter Place where he and Watson now carried on their experiments. By this time Bell began to experiment with the electrolytic transmitter, in which a wire attached to a diaphragm dipped into acidulated water contained in a metal cup. On the evening of March 10, 1876, they tried out this transmitter for the first time with excellent results. The transmitter was in one room and the receiver in an- other, when Bell suddenly shouted into the transmitter, “Watson, corne here 1 want you.” Bell had spilled acid on his clothing and wanted Watson to help him. When Bell discovered that Watson had heard his words distinctly on the receiver the spilled acid was forgotten. They changed places back and forth, talking and listening, and both were filled with enthusiasm. TELEPHONE PATENT GRANTED Bell’s telephone patent was granted on March 7, 1876, and fortunately for Bell he had written his specifications in broad enough language to caver not only his original elec- tromagnetic transmitter but also such other types as the electrolytic. THE TELEPHONE AT THE CENTENNIAL EXPOSITION The year 1876 was the centennial of the nation’s founding, and in commemoration of that event a great World’s Fair"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Telephone 143 was held in Philadelphia. Bell had not entered his tele- phone, but Hubbard, who was in charge of the Massachu- setts educational exhibit, persuaded Bell to exhibit his tele- phone in that section. When the judges had reached the exhibit nearest that in which the telephone was shown, it was late on a hot day, and the judges were about to leave. Dom Pedro, the Emperor of Brazil, who was with the judges saw Bell, whom he had met previously in connection with his work on deaf mutes, and greeted him warmly. The judges followed Dom Pedro, who, when he learned of Bell’s exhibit, insisted that the judges inspect it. One after an- other of the judges, headed by Sir William Thomson, lis- tened while Bell recited from Hamlet into the transmitter on the opposite side of the hall. At first they were aston- ished and then became enthusiastic, as they alternately lis- tened and spoke into the apparatus. They requested Bell to have the telephone moved to the Judges’ Hall for further tests. The day was Sunday, and on Monday Bell was to be in Boston for the annual examina- tion of his speech classes, SO that it was necessary for some- one else to look after the demonstrations. With some mis- givings on the part of Bell, William Hubbard was assigned to the task. The Young Hubbard acquitted himself very well, SO that at least from the judges’ point of view the telephone was the most important exhibit at the fair. TESTING THE TELEPHONE Late in July Bell went to Brantford once again, taking with him two telephone sets. He made arrangements with the Dominion Telegraph Company for the use of a telegraph line between Brantford and Paris, a distance of 8 miles, for a test of his apparatus. At first he used low-resistance re- ceivers, but the voices were obscured by line noises. When"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"144 Chapter l’en he used high-resistance receivers, the voices came through clearly. The battery that supplied the energy in this case was in Toronto, 68 miles distant, SO that the circuit was in reality more than 70 miles in length. On August 4 Bell’s father held a reception at his house in Tutelo Heights, outside of Brantford, and arrangements were made for the use of a telegraph line into Brantford, the last leg of which consisted of iron stove-pipe wire tacked on wooden fente posts to bring the circuit into the Bell home. This test was also eminently successful and de- lighted the assembled guests. Apparently a11 of these tests were made with the original electromagnetic telephone in which the transmitter and receiver were one and the same. During that summer Bell offered Watson a one-tenth inter- est in the telephone if Watson would devote a11 of his time to further work on its improvement. Watson was reluctant to accept the offer because he, like Bell, was in need of money, and his job at the Williams shop provided a steady income. After several weeks, however, he did accept and moved into Bell’s quarters on Exeter Place. Here the work continued and soon resulted in an important improvement, the substitution of a thin iron disk for the membrane used in previous instruments. A second great improvement, made by Watson, was the use of permanent magnets in the re- ceivers in place of the soft iron cores of the electromagnets. With this instrument batteries were unnecessary. WESTERN UNION REFUSES TO BUY THE TELEPHONE Despite his successes Bell felt frustrated, because he wanted to get married and he wanted to repay those who had SO generously supported him. With these thoughts in mind he"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Telephone 145 offered his telephone to the Western Union Telegraph Com- pany for $100,000 but was refused. S O far Bell’s telephone had brought him no financial re- turns except for such fees as he collected for his lectures and demonstrations before various organizations, of which there were many. The first actual telephone installation was made between the Williams shop in Boston and the Williams home in Somerville, a distance of three miles. BELL IS MARRIED Alexander Graham Bell and Mabel Hubbard were married on July 11, 1877, and early in August they embarked on a steamship bound for England, where they remained for fif- teen months. In England, Bell gave demonstrations before scientific and other gatherings, and finally before Queen Victoria. While he was still in England the Electric Tele- phone Company was organized, and began installing tele- phones in London, using the Bell inventions. As was the case with Morse, Bell was unable to obtain a British patent because of prior publication. Riva1 telephone companies sprang up, including one promoted by Fred Gower, whom Bell had employed earlier in connection with his American demonstrations. ORGANIZATION OF TELEPHONE COMPANIES In the United States Bell’s partners had formed a company called the Bell Telephone Association in which Hubbard, Sanders, and Bell each owned a three-tenths interest, and Watson one-tenth. The company appointed agents in vari- ous parts of the country whose duty it was to make tele- phone leases and make telephone installations. At first these were only private lines, sometimes on the same prem- ises and sometimes between office and home."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"146 Chapter Ten Thomas Sanders had invested large sums of money in Bell’s telephone up to the point that his credit was be- coming stretched, and he was in danger of losing his leather business. In the spring of 1878 Sanders’s relatives came for- ward with the funds needed to organize the New England Telephone Company, which was licensed by the Bell Tele- phone Association to engage in the telephone business, using Bell equipment. The Bell telephone at this time was still the simple electro- magnetic device in which the same instrument served as both transmitter and receiver. In order to cal1 the person at the other end of the line it was necessary to tap the dia- phragm of the instrument SO as to produce a faint noise at the other end. Watson made a mechanical device to accom- plish the same purpose, which was called Watson’s thumper. Shortly thereafter, however, he invented the polarized bell, actuated by a small magneto. The first crude exchange was installed by the Holmes Burglar Alarm Company in Boston in May 1877. Tele- phones in various financial institutions that had burglar alarms could be connected through the Holmes central office. The first commercial exchange was put into service in New Haven, Connecticut, on January 25,1878. INFRINGEMENT BY THE WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH COMPANY In December 1877 the Western Union Telegraph Company, which earlier had refused to buy Bell’s patent, organized the American Speaking Telephone Company. It owned the patents on the Edison carbon transmitter, Gray’s inven- tions, and the Page induction coi1 patent. For the Western Union Telegraph Company to engage in the telephone busi- ness was a relatively simple matter because it already owned"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"The Telephone 147 the necessary lines, the manufacturing facilities, and had ample capital. With the Edison transmitter and the induction coi1 West- ern Union had a telephone far superior to that of Bell and soon made great inroads into the telephone business. The Bell company by this time had about three thousand tele- phones in service. Hubbard and Sanders brought suit against the Western Union Telegraph Company for patent infringement. With Bell still in England it was necessary to communicate by table many times to clarify disputed points. Bell became convinced that it was useless to fight the powerful Western Union Telegraph Company and was completely discour- aged. He left England late in October 1878 with his wife and a small daughter, born to them in May 1878, with the inten- tion of going to Brantford for an indefinite stay. Bell was, however, badly needed to testify at the tria1 in the infringe- ment suit against Western Union. Watson, who had gone to Quebec to meet the ship which docked on November 10, 1878, succeeded in persuading the reluctant Bell to return to Boston, where he entered Massachusetts General Hospi- ta1 for an operation. While he was there he made several important depositions of great importance to the infringe- ment proceedings. BELL PATENT UPHELD The tria1 lasted about one year, at the end of which time a settlement was agreed upon under which the patent rights relating to the telephone were to be pooled; the Western Union was to receive a one-fifth interest in the Bell com- pany rentals and four-fifths were to be retained by the Bell company. This settlement was a clear victory for the Bell"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"148 Chapter Ten company in that it established beyond doubt the validity of its patents. One of the factors influencing the outcome was the acquisition by the Bell company of the Blake transmit- ter in October 1878, making the competitive positions of the two companies more nearly equal. TRANSMITTERS Although Bell had experimented with the liquid transmitter in 1876 and found that it yielded much better results than his electromagnetic transmitter and receiver, he clung to his original invention tenaciously until the Bell company was compelled by competition to adopt the Blake transmitter. There were many forms of transmitter in the early history of the telephone, including Reis’s metallic contacts, the liquid transmitter, the Emile Berliner transmitter of 1877, the Edison carbon transmitter, the Blake carbon and plati- num transmitter, the Hunnings granular carbon and plati- num transmitter and its later improvements, and the solid back transmitter invented in 1890 by A. C. White, using carbon disks and granules. The Dolbear electrostatic trans- mitter was never used in actual practice. THEODORE N. VAIL While this book is a history of electricity and magnetism, it is also inevitably bound up with persons and corporations. Up to the time of Bell’s sojourn in England the moving spirits behind the Bell companies were Bell, Hubbard, Sand- ers, and Watson. In May 1878, Theodore N. Vail, who had been general superintendent of railway mails for the United States Post Office, was given the position of general superin- tendent of the Bell company. It was his hard-nosed attitude which was to a large extent responsible for the favorable settlement with Western Union."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"The Telephone 149 Figure 10.2 Alexander Graham Bell (From Smithsonian Insti- tution)"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"150 Chapter Ten EVOLUTION OF THE BELL COMPANIES The Bell Telephone Association and the New England Tele- phone Company have already been mentioned. On July 30, 1878, the Bell Telephone Company was incorporated in Massachusetts, with a capital of $450,000, to succeed the original Bell Telephone Association. On March 13, 1879, the National Bell Telephone Company was incorporated with a capital of $850,000, and it controlled the New En- gland Telephone Company and the Bell Telephone Com- pany. Early in 1880 the American Bell Telephone Company was incorporated in Massachusetts with a capital of $10,000,000, and its stock was exchanged for that of the National Bell Telephone Company, on the basis of six shares for one, after which transaction the latter company was dissolved. Finally the American Telephone and Tele- graph Company was incorporated in New York on March 3, 1885, to take over the long lines of the Bell companies, and it eventually became the owner of the majority stock inter- est in the various regional telephone systems. Its first presi- dent was Theodore N. Vail. Colonel William H. Forbes, together with his brother J. Malcom Forbes, H. L. Higginson, and Lee, Higginson and Company had by May 1, 1880, acquired a controlling inter- est in the American Bell Telephone Company. Colonel Forbes, who was a close friend of Sanders, had purchased a large block of stock through Sanders in 1879, and in that year became president of the National Bell Telephone Com- pany. When the American Bell Telephone Company was organized, Forbes became its president, with W. R. Driver as treasurer and Theodore N. Vail as general manager.

BELL LABORATORIES AND WESTERN ELECTRIC COMPANY Many inventions and discoveries with uses in and outside the telephone industry, such as the transistor and the solar cell, have been made by the Bell Telephone Laboratories. The Western Electric Company, successor to the Western Electric Manufacturing Company of Chicago and the Wil- liams shop of Boston, a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, has pro- duced telephones, switchboards, tables, and the many other kinds of equipment required in the telephone business. OTHER TELEPHONE SYSTEMS The telephone has become almost universal. In most coun- tries outside the United States telephone systems have been largely government-owned and have been connected with the post office. In some countries telephone systems have been installed by foreign private corporations such as the International Telephone and Telegraph Company. There are numerous telephone manufacturing companies in other countries, especially in Sweden, England, France, Holland, and Germany. In the United States there are sev- eral manufacturers other than the Western Electric Com- pany, producing telephone equipment used by independent telephone companies. Although the Bell system controls the greater part of the telephone business in the United States, it is by no means a complete monopoly."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"11 Electric Lighting Three forms of electric lighting have been known for a long time. The electric spark, which later became the electric arc, was the first to be observed. Next came the glow in partially exhausted glass globes excited by an electrical dis- charge, and finally came the glow of a wire heated by the passage of an electric current. Hawksbee performed a series of beautiful experiments in partially exhausted glass globes in 1705. Some of these were globes that he used as part of his frictional electric machines. Jean Picard had noted similar effects in the evac- uated portion of a Torricellian tube in 1675 but did not know that they were due to electricity. Sir Humphry Davy first exhibited the electric arc at a lecture at the Royal Institution in London in 1809. Current for the experiment was supplied by a large battery that had recently been in- stalled. The dazzling light of the carbon arc made a deep impression upon the gathering. After the invention of the Leyden jar it was discovered that a discharge from a battery of such jars would heat or even fuse small wires. Soon after Volta’s invention of his pile, the heating effects of electric currents were observed. Many of the batteries were sufficiently powerful to fuse iron rods. It is not known who first proposed using such heated conductors as sources of light. ARC LAMPS As long as the voltaic battery remained the only source of current electricity it was impracticable to use electricity for illumination because of the expense involved. With the development of magnetoelectric machines and later of dynamoelectric machines, interest in electric lighting sprang"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"Electric Lighting 153 up almost immediately. The first practical arc lighting in- stallation, as was previously mentioned, was made at South Foreland Lighthouse in England in 1858, using a Nollet magnetogenerator. Beginning in the middle 1870s arc lamps and arc lamp machines were produced in great num- bers and varied forms. ARC LAMP MECHANISMS There were literally hundreds of different arc lamp feed mechanisms. The arc lamp required that the electrodes be in contact for starting and then be separated by a sufficient space to maintain a steady arc of maximum brightness. Usu- ally arc lamps were operated .in series SO that the same current passed through a11 of the lamps in the circuit. In order to prevent the entire circuit from being interrupted by the outage of a single lamp, a short-circuiting device was an essential part of the lamp. Some of the control mechanisms were simple, while others were complicated and ingenious. In general the feed mecha- nisms employed electromagnets, racks and pinions, ratch- ets, and gears. Sometimes the Upper carbon dropped by gravity as it burned, and in some cases both carbons were moved together mechanically as they became shorter. In most instances the power was supplied by electromagnets, but there were some that contained a clockwork that re- quired winding. Between the years 1841 and 1844 Deleuil and Archereau devised an arc lamp regulating mechanism that they applied to two lamps installed in Paris. Because these lamps were supplied by Bunsen batteries, the expense of operation proved to be prohibitive. In 1846, however, an arc light was used in a presentation of the opera The Prophet in Paris, using a lamp mechanism made by Duboscq. Several inven-"},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"154 Chapter Eleven tors in England were also engaged in the design of arc lights, notably Wright and Staite. Staite’s lamps were used for lighting a large hall, but the great cost of batteries made a11 of these attempts impracticable. CARBONS The carbons used in the early period of arc lighting were tut from pieces of coke. More satisfactory carbons were made later from a carbon paste molded under pressure. The paste consisted of f mely divided coke mixed with a carbonaceous binder. After forming under pressure, the rods were heated to drive off the unwanted gaseous ma- terials and to form a hard carbon rod. A later improvement was made by copper-plating most of the length of the car- bon rod to increase its conductivity. MANUFACTURERS In Europe the machines of Nollet, Siemens, Wilde, Ladd, Gramme, Schuckert, Ferranti, Hefner and Alteneck, Gulcher, Jablochkov, and others were used for arc lighting. In the United States the principal machines were those of Brush, Thomson-Houston, Weston, and Wallace-Farmer. Each of the American firms mentioned manufactured a complete arc lighting system including lamps, generators, regulating devices, switchboards, and other accessories. STREET LIGHTING For twenty years the only arc lamp installations in regular service were the British lighthouses previously mentioned. In 1876 Jablochkov, a Russian, invented a very simple form of arc lamp known as the Jablochkov candle. In this lamp two carbon rods were placed parallel to each other and about 7s inch apart.

At the top of the candle was placed a powdered carbon mixture or a loose bit of carbon bridging the gap between the rods, SO that when the current was turned on an arc was established at each lamp. The Jablochkov system used an alternating-current generator SO that the two carbon rods were consumed at the same rate. This was the first commer- cial use of alternating currents. The Jablochkov candle gave a soft pleasing light and be- cause of its simplicity gained favor for street lighting pur- poses. An installation of Jablochkov candles, which oper- ated successfully for three years, was made on the Avenue de l’Opéra in Paris about 1877. Alternating current for these lamps was supplied by Gramme machines. Each lamp contained four candles that were switched on in turn auto- matically as the preceding candle was consumed. Each candle burned about 1% hours. In the United States Charles F. Brush installed arc lamps in the show Windows of the Wanamaker store in Philadel- phia in 1878. Twenty lamps were employed for this pur- pose, supplied by five Brush dynamos. Crowds of people gathered to see the new lights, and to them it was a demon- stration of a new wizardry of which they had little concep- tion. Charles F. Brush was a resident of Cleveland, and his lamps, dynamos, and other equipment were manufactured by the Cleveland Telegraph Supply Company. The Wana- maker installation excited the admiration of two youthful professors at the Philadelphia Central High School: Elihu Thomson and Edwin J. Houston. Inspired by the success of the Brush installation, they set about building an arc light machine, with the financial assistance of George S. Garrett."},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Electric Lighting 157 The Thomson-Houston machine and lamps were successful, and installations of these followed soon thereafter. An experimental street lighting installation, consisting of twelve Brush arc lamps, was turned on in Cleveland on April 29, 1879. During the same year a company was orga- nized in San Francisco known as the California Electric Light Company, which proposed to go into the business of furnishing arc light service for the streets and buildings of the City. The company’s first installation consisted of two Brush dynamos, one with a capacity of six lights and the other sixteen lights. Business grew rapidly SO that additions to the plant were needed almost immediately. The first lamps were hung in business places, but within a short time contracts were made for the lighting of streets. As news of the success of arc lighting spread, there was an immediate demand for electric lights from a11 parts of the country, SO that for several years Brush, Thomson-Houston, Weston, and Wallace-Farmer were unable to keep up with the demand for equipment. By 1884 or 1885 arc lighting for streets was in general use throughout the United States and also in Europe. One interesting application, developed by the Brush company, was the use of ta11 steel towers, on which were mounted from four to eight arc lights to serve as a sort of artificial moon. Although a great many of these installations were made, they were abandoned within a short time. Arc lights were well suited to street lighting and for many years were also used successfully for the lighting of large buildings. They were not, however, well adapted to the lighting of homes and smaller buildings, because the light was too intense, it was not of the proper quality, and it flickered considerably.

ENCLOSED ARC LAMPS There was little change in arc lighting for some years until 1893, when the enclosed arc was introduced by Louis B. Marks. The enclosed arc was used extensively for the inte- rior lighting of stores and larger halls, but it was less ef- ficient than the open arc light. One of its more important advantages was that the carbons lasted ten to twelve times as long as in the open arc. FLAMING ARCS In 1898 Bremer of Germany invented the open flaming arc, in which the carbons were impregnated with various metal- lit salts. It produced intense illumination with colors de- pending upon the salts used. This lamp had an efficiency of about 35 lumens per watt as compared with 5 to 8 lumens per watt in the enclosed arc and about 15 lumens per watt in the ordinary open carbon arc. A lumen is the quantity of light which falls on a square foot of area of a sphere of 1 foot radius at the tenter of which is a 1 candlepower light source. Since the area of such a sphere is 12.57 square feet, the theoretical lumens would be 12.57 per candlepower. In practice, because some of the light of any actual light source is blocked off by the lamp itself, the total lumens are sometimes taken to be 10 times the horizontal candle- power. INCANDESCENT ELECTRIC LIGHTS Methods of lighting by electricity other than the arc lamp had been tried by various experimenters beginning in the early part of the nineteenth Century. The glow emitted by a wire heated by an electric current had been observed soon"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"Electric Lighting 161 after the invention of the voltaic battery, and in fact iron and platinum wires had been heated to incandescence or even volatilized by the discharge of Leyden jars. Sir William Grove, the inventor of the battery bearing his name, devised a lamp in 1840 in which a platinum wire was heated to incandescence by an electric current, while en- closed in a glass tumbler inverted over water. Apparently the first incandescent lamp for which a patent was granted was that of Frederick de Moleyns of Chelten- ham, England. He received a British patent on August 21, 1841, for a lamp in which finely divided carbon was fed into a gap between two coils of platinum wire connected to opposite poles of a battery. The platinum wires and a glass tube containing a supply of powdered charcoal were en- closed in an exhausted glass globe. J. W. Starr of Cincinnati, Ohio, sought a British patent in 1845 covering two incandescent lamps. In one lamp the light source was a platinum strip enclosed in a glass globe. The length of the platinum strip was variable SO as to adapt the lamp for different battery voltages. In the second lamp the substance to be heated to incandescence was a short piece of carbon rod which was held by clamps at each end. This assembly was placed in an expanded chamber at the Upper end of a T orricellian tube and therefore operated in a vacuum. Such a lamp could be used for only a short time before the glass became blackened, and like its predecessors it proved impracticable. Other incandescent lamps were devised by Staite, Nollet, Roberts, Way, Shepard, de Changy, Gardiner, Morris, Farmer, Swan, Lodyguine, Konn, Sawyer and Man, and many others. Moses G. Farmer lighted the living room of his home in Salem, Massachusetts, during the month of July 1859 by means of incandescent electric lights, the current"},{"pageNumber":180,"pageContent":"162 Chapter Eleven for which was supplied by Bunsen batteries. These lamps, which burned in open air, were merely strips of platinum, tapered at both ends and clamped to terminal pieces. Sir Joseph Swan’s lamp of 1860 had a horseshoe-shaped filament made of a strip of carbonized paper, operating in a vacuum. With the air pumps available at that time the vac- uum was rather imperfect, and this fact led to the failure of these lamps. In 1865 the Sprengel mercury pump was in- vented which made possible high vacuums. In 1878 Swan made lamps with carbon filaments which gave good results. There is considerable justification for the claim that Swan rather than Edison was the inventor of the incandescent lamp, except that Edison produced the first commercially acceptable incandescent lamps and accessories. EDISON’S INCANDESCENT LAMP In the United States the same problem was attacked with great energy by Farmer, Sawyer and Man, Maxim, and Edi- son. Farmer, Sawyer, and Maxim each produced graphite lamps in 1878 a11 of which operated successfully, but as was the case with a11 other lamps SO far produced they had short lives. The globes soon became black, and they were expen- sive. Edison began work on the incandescent lamp in his labora- tory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, in 1877. In his first lamps Edison experimented with carbon, then with platinum, with metallic alloys, and then returned to carbon. Several patents were granted to him on the metal filament lamps. In 1877 and 1878 Edison was for the most part occupied with his work on the phonograph. In July 1878 he accom- panied an expedition to Wyoming to view an eclipse of the sun. On his return late in August, he went first to Ansonia, Connecticut, to visit the Wallace Brass works.

When Edison returned to Menlo Park, he brought with him one of the small dynamos. At Menlo Park Edison now attacked the problem of the incandescent light in earnest. For more than a year he ex- perimented with a11 sorts of materials, including metals, car- bonized thread, paper, wood fiber, bamboo, palm leaves, and whatever else seemed to hold any promise of fulfilling the conditions required for a durable filament. Finally on October 21, 1879, he made a lamp with a carbonized thread filament that burned for forty-five hours before it failed. He applied for a patent on November 4, 1879, which was granted on January 27, 1880. EDISON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY Edison was not only a great inventor but also an excellent businessman and an organizer. On October 17, 1878, more than a year before he made his first successful incandescent lamp, The Edison Electric Light Company was organized with a capital of $300,000. The stockholders and directors included some of the most important New York bankers and financiers. After his successful carbonized thread lamp, Edison con- tinued his experiments and made rather a large number of lamps with carbonized paper filaments. Incidentally, the name filament was first applied by Edison. Before that time the glowing elements in the lamps had usually been desig- nated as burners, to correspond with gas burners. On Sunday, December 21, 1879, the New York Herald printed a full-page description of Edison’s lighting system, which by this time included not only his incandescent lamp but also his dynamo and auxiliary equipment.

MENLO PARK On New Year’s Eve 1879, an experimental installation of lamps with carbonized paper filaments was made at Menlo Park. Special trains were run from New York City to ac- commodate the crowds of people who came to see the new lights. Edison had succeeded in “subdividing” the electric light according to the queer expression that had become current during the preceding period. For some unaccount- able reason people had the notion that the electric light was the arc light, and it was argued with great vehemence that the light could not be subdivided, that is, produced in smaller units of lower intensity than the familiar arc lamp. THE SEARCH FOR BETTER FILAMENT MATERIALS Despite his successes Edison was not satisfied that he had obtained the best possible material for his lamp filaments, and continued his experiments with various vegetable fibers. He dispatched emissaries to Japan, China, Burma, Ceylon, and South America to obtain specimens of bam- boo, grasses, palms, and wood. His greatest success was with bamboo, and for nine years his lamps were made with car- bonized bamboo filaments. IMPROVEMENTS IN LAMP SEALS AND IN DYNAMOS He was also working on various other problems connected with the incandescent lamp such as improving the seal around the lead-in wires, obtaining a better vacuum by ex- pelling the occluded gases in the filament, and making a"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"166 Chapter Eleven Figure 11.5 An Edison Bipolar Dynamo.

Edison was engaged also in developing a constant-voltage dynamo, with low interna1 resistance and greatly improved efficiency.

This installation included four dynamos, three of which oper- ated in parallel, with the fourth used as an exciter. This plant went into operation on May 2, 1880. Early in January 1881 an Edison lighting system was installed in the litho- graphing plant of Hinds, Ketchum and Company at 229 Pearl Street, New York. About 150 installations in pri- vate plants were made during the following two years with more than 30,000 lamps. Edison’s lamps by this time were equipped with the now familiar screw base. As the production of lamps increased in quantity, the quality improved and the cost was greatly reduced. The growth of the lamp business soon made the facilities of the Menlo Park laboratories inadequate. A fac- tory building was purchased in Menlo Park in 1880 for use as a lamp factory, but this also soon became too small, SO that in 1881 a group of factory buildings in Harrison, New Jersey, was taken over by Edison for the manufacture of lamps. This plant was operated by the Edison Lamp Com- pany, a separate company that had been organized in 1880. PEARL STREET, THE FIRST CENTRAL STATION FOR INCANDESCENT LIGHTING Edison had realized for some time that substantial econo- mies were possible through pooling the generating facilities for a large number of customers in a single plant, or in other words through the construction of a central station.

The plant was constructed at 257 Pearl Street, with boilers at the street level and engines and dynamos on the floor above. Engines and boilers were purchased from the manu- facturers of such equipment. Dynamos were built by the Edison Machine Works on Goerck Street in New York City. Sockets, switches, and other equipment were produced by Bergmann and Company on Wooster Street. Bergmann had been associated with Edison at Menlo Park. Underground conduits and fittings were made by the Underground Tube Company at 65 Washington Street. The Pearl Street plant and distribution system were com- pleted and put into operation on September 4, 1882. The system was an unqualified success notwithstanding many misgivings of Edison and his associates. This was the first incandescent central station in the United States, but there had been many earlier stations supplying arc lamp service.

In 1886 the Edison Machine Works moved to Schenectady, New York, where it later became the nucleus of the great General Electric Company works. Harrison, New Jersey, re- mained the site of one of the greatest lamp factories. FOREIGN INCANDESCENT LIGHT INSTALLATIONS The Paris exposition of 1881 gave great impetus to the adoption of incandescent lighting. At this exposition Edi- son exhibited a complete lighting system, including gener- ators, conductors, switches, fuses, lamps, sockets, and fix- tures. Other exhibitors were Swan and Lane-Fox of England, and Maxim of the United States. In 1882 there was an electrical exposition in the Crystal Palace in London that included many electric lighting exhibits and a complete installation by Edison of his generating equipment, lamps, sockets, and accessories. At about the same time the Edison Electric Lighting Com- pany of London Ltd. was constructing a plant in a building at Holborn Viaduct to serve nearby customers, among whom was the British Post Office. This plant began opera- tion in March 1882, about six months earlier than the Pearl Street station. Early Edison lamps had no base, but the lead-in wires were merely bent back over the neck of the lamp and made contact with two spring clips in the socket. In the latter part of the year 1880 the first Edison screw base lamps appeared, followed by improvements in 1881."},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"manufacturers used a different lamp base and socket. Grad- ually, however, there was a shift to the Edison screw base, and in many cases, in which a different socket had been in- stalled originally, adapters were provided SO that Edison lamps could be used. In the early 1900s the Edison base became the standard for the United States except for spe- cial applications. Many European manufacturers also adopted the Edison base, but some, even to the present day, use a bayonet type of base, similar to that used on automobile lamps. IMPROVED LAMPS The bamboo filament lamp was produced in great numbers and was found to be rugged, but its efficiency was only about 1.7 lumens per watt when new, and only half that amount when the bulb had become blackened. With con- stant research and consequent improvements the efficiency reached 2.5 lumens per watt in 1881. There was also a grad- ual improvement in manufacturing methods, in lamp con- struction, in lamp life, and a substantial decrease in cost. In 1890 or thereabouts, there was a significant change when the squirted filament was introduced. This filament, as the name implies, was made by squirting a carbonaceous paste through a die, after which the soft thread was carbonized. Lamps of this type and the improved Gem lamp of 1905 were manufactured until about 1918, but long before that time metal filament lamps had taken over the great bulk of the market."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"Electric Lighting 173 OTHER TYPES OF LAMPS Many new types of lamps came into existence begimiing at the turn of the Century. Aside from the arc lamp improve- ments previously mentioned, came the low-pressure mer- cury arc lamp invented by Peter Cooper Hewitt in 1901, and with it the mercury arc rectifier. Also in 1901, H. W. Nernst of Germany invented the Nernst lamp in which the light source was composed of one or more rods of molded oxides of zirconium and yttrium. This material was prac- tically a nonconductor when cold but had an increased conductivity with increase in temperature. It was necessary therefore to provide a heating coi1 to raise the temperature sufficiently SO that current would flow through the glower itself. This lamp was used for only a few years for indoor and outdoor lighting. The osmium lamp was developed in 1905 by Dr. Auer von Welsbach, followed by the tantalum lamp in 1906 by Dr. Werner von Bolton, both of Germany. The sintered tungsten lamp was patented in Germany by Just and Hana- man of Vienna in 1903, and a United States patent was applied for in 1905, but because of other claims the patent was not granted until 1912. While tungsten was an excellent material for lamp filaments, the metal was SO brittle that it had not been possible to draw it into wire. The filament produced by the Just and Hanaman method was formed by taking finely divided tungsten, mixing it with a binder, squirting the paste through a die, and sintering the particles of tung- sten together by passing a current of electricity through the thread that had been formed. Lamps made by this method were far more efficient than carbon lamps, but the filament was weak and easily broken, and the lamps were expensive. Nevertheless the sintered tungsten lamps went"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"In a relatively short time drawn-wire tungsten filament lamps were produced for the market. In 1913 Dr. Irving Langmuir, also of the General Electric Company, perfected the gas-filled tungsten lamp. This lamp was a great step forward because the filaments in these lamps could be oper- ated at considerably higher temperatures and consequently higher efficiencies, particularly in the larger sizes, where efficiencies of 20 lumens per watt were reached. TUBE LIGHTING Geissler tubes, which were mentioned previously, were pro- duced in great numbers around the middle of the nine- teenth Century. Some of these tubes contained mercury or various of the rare gases in small amounts, which gave off their characteristic color spectra when excited by the dis- charge of an electrostatic machine or an induction coil. Many of the tubes were also made with glass containing salts that fluoresced in beautiful colors when they were excited. About the year 1895, D. McFarlan Moore of the United States began experimenting with long glass tubes filled with carbon dioxide gas, which gave off a good quality white light when a crurent of electricity was sent through them at relatively high voltage. Beginning at about the year 1904, many installations of such tube lighting were made, espe- cially in stores. Geissler had used neon and other rare gases in bis tubes, but such gases were expensive to produce. Georges Claude of France discovered a method of obtaining neon cheaply,"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Electric Lighting 175 and about 1910 began making neon tube lighting, but it was not until 1922 that such lighting was introduced com- mercially, largely for advertising. The principle underlying sodium vapor lamps was dis- covered about 1910, but they were first used for highway lighting in 1933. High-pressure mercury lamps were developed in 1912, but these lamps, now widely used for highway and airport light- ing, were not introduced commercially until 1934. FLUORESCENT LAMPS The early research work on fluorescent lamps was done in Germany and in England. It had long been known that certain minerals would fluoresce under the influence of ultraviolet light, but no practical application was made of such phenomena until many years later. The first fluores- cent lamps were made in Europe in 1934. They were intro- duced commercially in the United States in 1938. The fluo- rescent lamp is essentially a low-pressure mercury arc lamp, producing ultraviolet light, which in turn causes a coating on the inside of the tube to fluoresce with a color depend- ing upon the kind of material used. LAMP EFFICIENCIES Efficiencies had increased enormously with the introduc- tion of new types of lamps. Sodium vapor lamps had effi- ciencies of about 70 lumens per watt. High-pressure mer- cury lamps yielded from 40 to 55 lumens per watt, and fluorescent lamps produced a lifetime average of 51 lumens per watt. These figures may be compared with the early Edison lamps that yielded less than 2 lumens per watt."},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"bulbs, automobile lamps, sterilamps, sunlamps, photo- graphie lamps, glow lamps, and a host of others."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"12 Alternating Currents The early electric lighting systems, bath arc light and incan- descent, used direct current with the notable exception of Jablochkov candles, which used alternating current SO that the electrodes might burn at the same rate. Some of the first magnetogenerators, such as the Nollet machines, had been built as alternators. Electrical designers and manufacturers of the early 1880s were not altogether ignorant of alternating currents, but from the viewpoint of that day direct current offered SO many advantages that alternating current had not been con- sidered seriously . Among other things there was no alternat- ing-current motor, and alternating-current generators could not be connected in parallel as Edison was doing with his dynamos. Direct current was suited to electroplating, elec- trolytic processes, and could be used for charging storage batteries. Arc lights performed better and more quietly on direct current, and many electromagnetic devices would not function satisfactorily on alternating current. Despite a11 of these disadvantages there was nevertheless one great advantage that was recognized after a time, namely that alternating currents could be readily and effi- ciently changed from one voltage to another, and since higher voltages were essential for transmission over dis- tances greater than about % mile, it was inevitable that al- ternating currents would be employed. THE TRANSFORMER The heart of the alternating-current system was the trans- former, and when the transformer had been brought to a satisfactory stage of development the alternating-current system was established.

During that same year, and following the path of Henry’s experiments, P ro essor f C. G. Page of Washington made up similar coils on which connections or taps were made at in- tervals throughout their length. Page found that when a battery circuit was made or broken through any two of these connections, sparks could be obtained through any other pair of connections. This arrangement was in effect an autotransformer. INDUCTION COILS The Reverend N. J. Callan of Maynooth College in Ireland constructed an electromagnet, as he called it, a description of which was published in 1836. It had a horseshoe-shaped iron tore upon which he wound two coils of wire, one upon the other. The inner coi1 was of heavy copper wire 50 feet long, and the outer coi1 was of fine iron wire 1300 feet long, each turn insulated from its adjacent turns. The two coils were connected and a tap was brought out from the junction between the coarse and fine wire coils. Callan found that by making or breaking a battery circuit through the inner coi1 strong shocks could be obtained from the outer coil. In the same year Callan constructed a much larger coi1 with two entirely separate windings, of which the inner one was copper wire ‘/binch in diameter, and the outer one also copper wire ‘/40 inch in diameter and 10,000 feet long. He provided this coi1 with an interrupter"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Alternating Currents 179 to produce an intermittent current. This coi1 produced sparks of considerable length. In 1837 Callan made several coils with separate primary and secondary windings, and he was able to increase the effect by connecting the secon- daries of several such coils in series. In the same year Sturgeon wound a double coi1 on a hol- low wooden spool into which he inserted iron cores. Profes- sor C. H. Bachhoffer, in working with a similar coil, dis- covered that a tore made up of a bundle of iron wires gave much better results than a solid iron tore. Page made several two-winding induction coils in 1838, using iron wire cores and magnetic interrupters. Page as- serted that he had used iron wire cores before February 1838, SO that there is some uncertainty as to whether he or Bachhoffer deserves the credit for the invention. The inter- rupter used on these coils was Page’s invention. It was ac- tuated by the magnetism in the tore and the break was made in mercury cups. Wagner and Neef made a modification of Page’s inter- rupter in which platinum contacts were substituted for the mercury cups. MacCauley of Dublin may, however, have made a similar interrupter at an earlier date than Wagner and Neef. In France Masson and Bréguet began to make induction coils of excellent workmanship in 1838. With them they charged Leyden jars and produced luminous discharges in evacuated tubes. Similar experiments had, however, already been performed by Page. H. D. Ruhmkorff of Paris began making induction coils about 1851. He was famiiiar with the work of Masson and Bréguet, and others who had already produced powerful coils. One of these built by Page in 1850 gave a spark of 8 inches. Ruhmkorff was an excellent craftsman, and made"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"from the primary winding. Fizeau, whose fame is due chiefly to his work with light, discovered in 1853 that the performance of an induction coi1 was greatly improved by connecting a condenser around the points of the interrupter. Such a condenser served to absorb the self-inductive discharge from the pri- mary and made the break more abrupt. It served also to reduce the burning of the points by minimizing the spark at that contact. Ruhmkorff adopted the condenser and made many im- provements in various details, SO that his coils were prob- ably the finest made anywhere. He engaged in their manu- facture on a large scale and was therefore often considered as the inventor of the induction coil. One of his largest coils made in 1867 gave sparks of 40 centimeters, or about 16 inches. Another Parisian, named M. Jean succeeded in obtaining a 30-inch spark by immersing his coi1 in turpentine. It is pos- sible however that Poggendorff may have originated the idea of oil immersion. Poggendorff improved the condenser by using mica in place of oiled silk or paper. He studied care- fully the proportions of coils that give the best results and the size of condenser required for coils of different sizes. Other important coi1 makers were Storer of Germany, Apps and Grove of England, and Ritchie of the United States. Ritchie made a coi1 in 1860 that gave a spark of 53 centimeters. The most famous coi1 was one built by Apps for Mr. Spottiswoode, known as the Spottiswoode"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"Alternating Currents 181 coil, which gave a spark of 42 inches, or nearly 107 centi- meters. Sir William Grove used alternating current from a small magneto machine to excite an induction coil. Up to this time the magnetic circuits of induction coils were open. The cores, except those of Callan, were almost invariably cylindrical in form. In 1856 C. F. Varley obtained a British patent for an induction coi1 with a closed magnetic circuit. The iron wires that made up the tore were considerably longer than the coil. When the coi1 had been completely wound and insulated, these wires were bent back over the coi1 from both ends SO as to encase it completely, and were then firmly secured by bands. Jablochkov had applied for a patent in 1877 for a coi1 to be used in connection with his arc lighting system in Paris. British patents were issued in 1878 to H. Wilde, C. W. Har- rison, C. T. Bright, J. B. Fuller, and de Meritens for induc- tion coils, or transformers to be used for purposes such as lighting and telegraphy. Marcel Desprez and Jules Car- pentier in France proposed in 1881 to use an induction coi1 to raise the potential at the generator for transmission to a more distant point and then to use a second induction coil, with connections reversed, to reduce the potential to a value suited to the purpose for which the energy was to be used. This proposa1 seems to have been the first to state clearly the use of transformers as we now know them. GAULARD AND GIBBS Gaulard and Gibbs began work in England in 1882 on the application of induction coils, or transformers, or sec- ondary generators as they called them, to long circuits for lighting. Their original coils had straight cylindrical cores of solid iron. They were used on series circuits with the pri-"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"energy for a group of incandescent lamps, and the other lighted several Jablochkov candles and incandescent lamps and also operated a small motor, probably a series com- mutator machine. Later in 1883 Gaulard and Gibbs made an installation along the Metropolitan Railway in London. Current was sent over a series circuit 16 miles in length through four transformers that served incandescent and arc lamps at four of the railway stations. At an exhibition held in Turin in 1884, they set up a circuit 50 miles in length with four of their secondary gen- erators along the route. Each of these served a group of arc and incandescent lamps. Gaulard and Gibbs were refused a British patent but were granted a United States patent in 1886. Their transformer had before this time been rede- signed with a closed laminated magnetic circuit. In the meantime, during the year 1885, Zipernowsky, Déri, and Blathy of Budapest exhibited a pair of trans- formers in London with closed magnetic circuits. These were operated at 1000 volts on the primary side and 100 volts secondary. Other more or less successful trans- formers with closed magnetic circuits, had been produced by Rankin, Kennedy, and Hopkinson. William Stanley had been experimenting with transform- ers, which he called converters, during the years 1884 and 1885. In the latter year, working independently of develop- ments abroad, he set up a circuit at Great Barrington, Mas- sachusetts, which included an alternator, a %-mile line, and a transformer, from which he operated 150 16-candlepower"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"Alternating Currents 183 lamps. Stanley’s transformer was of the shell type; that is, the iron tore to a large extent encircled the windings. The tore was made of sheet iron stampings, suitable for manu- facturing processes. WESTINGHOUSE ALTERNATING-CURRENT SYSTEM George Westinghouse had been watching the development of the alternating-current system with great interest and in 1885 purchased the Gaulard and Gibbs rights in the United States. He engaged William Stanley to work on rhe problem and to design a transformer that could be produced in quantities by ordinary manufacturing processes. The West- inghouse Company began the manufacture of alternating- current apparatus within a short time, including transform- ers, generators, and auxiliary equipment. The first large-scale installation was made in Buffalo in 1886. In the following two years a great many alternating-current installations were made by the Westinghouse Company in many cities throughout the United States. There was considerable opposition to alternating currents, especially by the Edison Company, based on the fact that high voltages were employed, which it was said were very dangerous, as they probably were at the time. The Thomson-Houston Company hesitated for several years, and then in 1888 brought out a competing alternating-cur- rent system. Professor Thomson had experimented with transformers while he was still teaching at Central High School in Philadelphia in 1879 and had delivered several lectures on the subject. ALTERNATING-CURRENT GENERATORS Little has been said about alternating-current generators. They developed quite naturally from the direct-current"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"mostly slow-speed steam engines, and even though genera- tors were belted, their speed was still slow. The speed of direct-current machines was kept low for another reason. In the early days, brush and commutator troubles were among the greatest difficulties experienced by the operators, and these troubles were greatly exaggerated at higher speed. When the carbon or graphite brush was introduced, some of the difficulties disappeared. FREQUENCIES Freyuencies at first were generally rather high; 133 cycles was common. With the coming of the induction motor, however, it was found that lower frequencies were far more suitable for power. Because of these conflicting require- ments the matter of frequencies was for a time in a chaotic state. Gradually the higher frequencies disappeared and most systems settled down to 50 or 60 cycles for lighting and 25 cycles for power, but there were some exceptions. AC-DC CONVERSION Most electric utilities started out with Edison or direct-cur- rent systems in their business sections, but as the demand for electric service for residential use developed, alter- nating-current systems were built to serve the more distant customers. These alternating current systems at first were single phase and were later replaced by two- or t,hree-phase installations. With this combination of direct- and alternating-current"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Alternating Currents 185 systems, it became desirable to shift the load from one to tbe other. For this purpose the rotary converter was the simplest answer, but with the knowledge then available rotary converters for the higher frequencies were impracti- table because of the high commutator speeds. It was not until about 1905 that 60-cycle rotary converters were intro- duced. Until that time tbey were used on 25-cycle or slightly higher frequencies, and motor-generators were used at higher frequencies. Street railway systems were changing from horse-drawn to electric traction during the late 1880s and the early 1890s under the leadership of Siemens and Hopkinson in Europe, and Edison, Sprague, Van Depoele, Bentley and Knight, and others in the United States. The advantages of alter- nating current generation, transformation, and transmis- sion, with conversion equipment in substations at various points soon became apparent. Here also, the lower frequen- cies were necessary because of the limitations of conversion equipment. In many cases the railway companies’ equip- ment was more modern than that of the electric utilities because the railway companies had the advantage of tbe experience gained by the electric companies. ALTERNATING-CURRENT MOTORS The direct-current motor was already well established when the alternating-current system came upon the scene. Series motors sometimes operated on series arc light circuits, and shunt or compound-wound motors were used on the incan- descent systems. It was found that some of the series mo- tors performed tolerably well on alternating current, but at reduced capacities. A form of induction motor was described by F. C. Bailey in 1879. Professor Galileo Ferraris of Turin, Italy, devel-"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"I 1 before a meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, his invention of the induction motor. George Westinghouse realized immediately the value of the new motor and acquired forthwith not only Tesla’s invention but also his services. Putting the new motor into com- mercial service was not without its difficulties. The early alternating-current systems were single-phase, 133 cycles- too high for a motor. The self-starting single-phase motor was not available at first, and without two- or three-phase circuits, the induction motor was useless. The coming of the induction motor, therefore, made nec- essary the overhaul and redesign of much of the existing apparatus and the scrapping of many machines only two or three years old. NIAGARA FALLS DEVELOPMENT There were widespread effects from the development of an alternating-current motor, most important of which was the power development at Niagara Falls. The original charter for power at Niagara Falls was granted in 1886. It was planned at that time to construct a tunnel to receive the water discharged from hydraulic turbines located at various poïnts in the city of Niagara Falls and discharge this water at a point below the falls. Industrial sites were to be pro- vided along a canal from which each lessee would take the water for which he contracted and discharge the tail water from his turbines into the tunnel."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Alternating Currents 187 Although the generation of electricity had been con- sidered, no serious thought had been given to converting large amounts of waterpower into electrical energy. The project was under discussion for several years, and many solutions were offered, including the transmission of power by compressed air. Fortunately the development of alter- nating-current apparatus had progressed sufficiently by this time SO that its use was considered practical. The solution finally adopted, after bitter debate and with considerable doubt and misgivings by many, was the plan offered by Professor George Forbes, which called for the installation of polyphase alternating-current generators. Work on the project was begun on October 4, 1890. The contracts for electrical equipment were awarded to the Westinghouse Company, and called for three 5000-horse- power, three-phase, 25-cycle, 2200-volt machines. This con- tract was let in October 1893, with delivery in about a year. Considering the fact that these were the largest machines built up to that time, and considering also that these were vertical machines in which the entire weight of the rotor was suspended from the top bearing, it was an engi- neering accomplishment of the first order. The first power was delivered in August 1895, and the first customer was the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which later became the Aluminum Company of America. This company produced aluminum hy the Hall process, which had been discovered in 1886. Operation of the first installation was eminently successful, and within a short time seven additional genera- tors were installed in Power House No. 1. TRANSMISSION LINES In the year 1891 a notable achievement was recorded in Germany with the construction of a llO-mile three-phase"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"about 1892 at 5000 volts, and from San Antonio, Califor- nia, to San Bernardino, also in 1892, 28 miles, with a 15-mile tap to Pomona. This second line operated at 10,000 volts single-phase. The succcss of these early lines encouraged the engineers at Niagara to undertake the transmission of power to Buf- falo in 1896. The first line was 22 miles in length and oper- ated at 11,000 volts, three-phase. After Power House No. 1, with a capacity of 50,000 horsepower, had been completed, Power House No. 2, with an identical 50,000 horsepower, was begun, but the electrical contracts were awarded to the General Electric Company. Following the success of the Niagara Falls development, power companies throughout the country began the instal- lation of two- and three-phase systems to replace the now- outmoded single-phase equipment. Other large-scale hydro- electric developments followed close upon the heels of the Niagara Falls installation. FREQUENCY AND VOLTAGE STANDARDS Because the electrical age had corne SO suddenly there were as yet no generally accepted standards. Not only were there direct- and alternating-current systems, but there were many voltages, two-phase and three-phase, 25 cycles, 35 cycles, 50 cycles, 60 cycles, and many types of equipment that were often incompatible with other equipment. With the passage of time direct current has almost disappeared; 60 cycles has become standard in the United States; volt-"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Alternating Currents 189 ages are generally multiples of 115, although 120 volts has become more common for residential service; and manu- facturers have adopted standards that make most types of equipment interchangeable.

Over- land transportation was limited until canais were con- structed to link up with natural waterways. RAILS AND RAILWAYS For some purposes it was found to be desirable to provide rails made of timber or stone to guide the wheels of wagons or carts. Some used flanged wheels riding on rails consisting of iron straps screwed to wooden stringers, and later iron rails attached to wooden ties were used. Installations of this sort became common around mines, quarries, and sawmills. The cars were sometimes drawn by horses, sometimes pulled by tables, and in other cases pushed by men. When the construction of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway had been nearly completed in 1829, the directors were undecided as to whether the motive power was to be the horse, the steam-driven table, or the steam locomotive. George Stephenson finally proved that his steam loco- motive was the most satisfactory method of propulsion. The steam locomotive proved its value, and from that time forward steam railroads were built in ever-increasing numbers. STREET RAILWAYS For urban transportation the horse-drawn coach or omnibus was widely used in larger cities and for interurban journeys. Construction of the first street railway, or tram- way, was begun in New York City in 1832. The cars were"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Electric Traction 191 home-drawn, provided with flanged wheels, rolling on iron straps screwed to wooden stringers. Operation of this line was begun in 1833, but the project soon failed due to lack of patronage. A similar project was undertaken in Boston in 1836. A second attempt was made in New York City in 1852, using grooved iron rails laid on timber stringers. This form of rail proved to be troublesome because it caught the carriage wheels. In Philadelphia, a step rail was used on a street railway in 1855 with somewhat greater success. The first British tramway was built at Birkenhead in 1860. Be- tween 1860 and 1890, home-drawn street railways were constructed in a11 of the larger cities of the United States, and a somewhat similar development occurred in Europe but at a slower rate, due, in part, to the many narrow, winding streets. The first elevated railroad began operation in New York City in 1867. Motive power at first was supplied by a table, but a short time later steam locomotives were substituted. This project, as was the case with the first surface line, became involved in financial troubles but was reorganized and continued to operate. Other elevated lines were built in New York City, and eventually a11 of these were con- solidated into one system. In some instances the steam locomotives built for use on the elevated lines were used on surface lines. These were not the same as those in use on main line railways but were lighter and resembled the cars in the train that they pulled. Such applications of steam locomotives were confined largely to interurban lines, where greater speed was re- yuired. ELECTRIC PROPULSION Horsecars, for a time, seemed to solve the public transporta- tion problem, but they were slow; and as the cities grew in"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"tion with his electric motor, built a small electric car which he operated on a circular track at Springfield, Massachu- setts, in 1835. Robert Davidson of Scotland, in 1838, built a five-ton car propelled by an electric motor of his own design. In 1847 Moses G. Farmer, whose name is already familiar because of his early experiments in electric lighting, con- structed and operated an electric car capable of carrying two passengers. Professor C. G. Page of Washington made a triai run of a small electric locomotive on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, between Washington and Bladensburg in 1851. The motor was of the walking-beam type. These and other experiments with electrically operated cars were interesting, but none of them was practical be- cause the motors were inefficient and the batteries used for power were much too expensive. After the dynamo had been brought to a reasonable state of perfection and had been found to be reversible, electric power for traction and other purposes took on an entirely different aspect. At the industrial exposition in Berlin in 1879, Dr. Werner Siemens exhibited and operated an electric locomotive and cars over a circular track about 900 feet long, with power supplied by a dynamo. The motors on the locomotives for the first time were commutator-type machines, which were capable of a steady and powerful pull. Current was supplied through a third rail. Two years later, in 1881, Dr. Siemens built an electric railway at Lichterfelde, a suburb of Berlin, as a regular"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Electric Traction 193 commercial ventrue. This electric railway went into opera- tion in the spring of 1881 and continued to carry passen- gers regularly thereafter. Following Siemen’s demonstration, numerous similar rail- ways were built. Applications for electric railway patents filed in the United States Patent Office by Thomas Edison and Dr. Werner Siemens in 1880 were denied because of a caveat filed by Stephen D. Field in 1879. The Field and Edison interests were, however, pooled, and a company called the Electric Railway Company of the United States was formed. Edison built a small experimental electric rail- way at Menlo Park in 1880 and another in 1882. Field also built an experimental electric railway at Stockbridge, Mas- sachusetts. At the Chicago Railway Exposition held in 1883, the Elec- trie Railway Company of the United States exhibited an electric railway. A third rail was used for this project, as was the case in the earlier Siemens exhibit, and the rail joints were bonded with heavy copper wire. Both the motor and the dynamo had been manufactured by the Weston Company. ELECTRIFICATION OF STREET RAILWAYS These demonstrations had shown that electric traction could become successful, and as a result street railway com- panies became deeply interested in electrification. There were many objections to horsecars and table cars, the most important of which was that they were too slow. Cities were spreading out, and there was great need for moving large numbers of people from their homes to their places of employment. In the United States those who became most active in this field, after Edison and Field, were Frank J. Sprague, Charles J. Van Depoele, Edward M. Bentley, Walter H."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":", able to Edison. After the installation of the Edison system at Brockton, Massachusetts, Sprague was put in charge. He continued his work with Edison but also devoted consider- able time to his own research on the electric motor. He succeeded in designing an excellent motor and at the same time began to take a serious interest in electric railways. In April 1883 he resigned from Edison’s organization and in November 1884 organized the Sprague Electric Railway and Motor Company. Van Depoele, who was a skilled cabinetmaker and wood- carver, came to Chicago from Belgium in 1869. He built up a successful business and with his surplus funds began to experiment with electrical equipment. Within ten years he was installing arc lighting systems of his own manufacture, and in 1880 the Van Depoele Electric Manufacturing Com- pany was established in Chicago. At about this time he became interested in electric railways, and in 1884 ex- hibited an electric railway in Toronto, which was equipped with overhead trolley wires. He received a United States patent covering this system a short time later, over the protests of Sprague, who had also invented overhead trol- leys but was out of the country at the time. Leo Daft installed and operated the Saratoga and Mount McGregor Railroad in 1883, using electricity for motive power. Later he electrified one of the New York elevated lines. Knight and Bentley, who were employed by the Brush Electric Company at Cleveland, developed an electric trac-"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Electric Traction 195 tion system that operated successfully. Their first experi- mental car was put in service on one of the Cleveland lines on July 26, 1884. Although the car was kept in operation, the difficulties encountered were enormous. They experi- enced troubles with the motor suspension, the main drive to the axles, the central station generators, the motors, and other equipment. Valuable experience was gathered, how- ever, and one by one the problems were solved. They abandoned the Cleveland experiment in 1887 and moved to Woonsocket, Rhode Island, where they had a contract with the street railway company for the electrification of the system. Equipment for this project was supplied by the Thomson-Houston Company. The first car on the Woon- socket lines was put in service in October 1887. Knight and Rentley entered into another contract with the Observatory Hi11 Passenger Railway Company of Allegheny City, Pennsylvania. This project involved problems that had not been encountered previously, such as a 12 percent grade on a Sharp curve. The work was completed in spite of the difficulties, and the first car was placed in service in January 1888. The problems that followed, for a time, seemed almost insurmountable. The motor brushes were laminated copper, and sparking was SO severe that brushes and commutators were sputtering and burning up in rapid succession, leaving a trail of copper along the entire route. The Sprague Electric Company undertook the electrifica- tion of the Richmond, Virginia, street railway system in 1887. After many construction difficulties, and after a case of typhoid fever, Sprague succeeded in getting portions of the electrified system into operation late that year. The Richmond undertaking was the most ambitious SO far, in that it involved more miles of track, more cars, and many grades, some of which were steep."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Depoele, who was then associated with the Thomson- Houston Company, recalled that he had once tried a carbon brush on a small motor and it had appeared to work satis- factorily.

Carbon brushes were tried and they worked.

When carbon brushes were substituted for copper and brass on the railway motors, peace and tranquillity settled down upon the sorely harassed railway shops. RAPID CONVERSION FROM HORSECARS TO ELECTRIC PROPULSION From that point forward electrification of the street rail- ways of the United States proceeded at a pace that taxed the ability of the manufacturers to supply the needed equipment. There was, of course, a steady evolution in mo- tors, cars, control equipment, rails, roadbeds, overhead con- ductors, and power supplies. Among the important develop- ments were the series-parallel controller, interpole motors, alternating-current distribution systems with rotary-con- verter or motor-generator substations, heavier rails, new methods of bonding, and higher speeds. SUBURBAN AND MAIN LINE ELECTRIFICATION The electric street railways developed into interurban lines, elevated railways, subway lines, and main line railways. Mention should be made also of trackless trolleys, which were buses equipped with electric motors fed from a double overhead trolley wire through a swiveled trolley pole. THE DECLINE OF ELECTRIC STREET RAILWAYS There are very few electric street railway systems remaining in the United States because of the lower cost and greater flexibility of buses powered by interna1 combustion en- gines. In Europe, however, where the automobile has not made such great inroads on the numbers of passengers carried, electric street railways are still operating success- fully."},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"In the one hundred years between the closing decade of the eighteenth Century and the late nineteenth Century, elec- tricity had progressed from a little-known, mysterious, natural phenomenon to a well-established science of great practical value. It had moved from the laboratory and lec- ture room into industry and commerce, where it touched the lives of all. The first giant step was taken by Volta, followed by Davy, Oersted, Faraday, Henry, Pixii, Ber- zelius, Ohm, Weber and Gauss, Ampère, Coulomb, Morse, Wheatstone, Swan, Edison, Bell, Maxwell, Helmholtz, and a host of others. The exploration of nature’s great house had indeed progressed at an amazing rate, but there were many doors that had not yet been unlocked. What lay beyond one of these had been guessed by Faraday, Henry, and Maxwell, but the key was found by a Young German profes- sor named Heinrich Hertz (1857-1894). HERTZ DISCOVERS ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES Hertz, as a Young man, had been an assistant to the great Helmholtz at Berlin. The researches of Helmholtz and the mathematical explorations of Maxwell had convinced him that certain electrical phenomena are accompanied by elec- tromagnetic waves in space. In 1887, at the age of thirty, when Hertz was professor of physics at the Technische Hochschule in Karlsruhe, he succeeded in proving the exis- tence of such waves by means of rather simple apparatus. He set up a circuit containing an induction coil, a wire loop, and a spark gap. At the other end of the table he had a"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic Waves and Radio 199 similar circuit containing only a spark gap. A discharge from the induction coi1 across the first gap was accom- panied by a weaker spark across the gap in the receiving circuit. In order to prove that this experiment did indeed demonstrate the existence of electrical waves, he carried on further experiments for several years, and succeeded in re- flecting and refracting these waves and in measuring their wavelength. Joseph Henry, many years earlier had nearly succeeded in proving what Hertz had found but had fallen a little short. He had even spoken of the phenomenon as resembling waves. Faraday had demonstrated that a mag- netic field rotated the plane of polarization of light waves, and Hertz proved that electromagnetic waves were not lim- ited to the very short ones. Maxwell’s mathematical genius had been vindicated. SIGNALING WITHOUT WIRES As has been SO often the case, great discoveries have been anticipated by others. In Galvani’s first frog experiment an electrical impulse had been transmitted from an electrical machine to a scalpel without wires. Morse performed an experiment in 1842, in which he buried two plates in the ground on one side of a canal, connected through a battery and a key, and on the other side he buried two similar plates, connected through a galvanometer. He succeeded in transmitting signals by means of this equipment, but the results here were due merely to conduction. Using somewhat similar equipment, Alexander Graham Bell performed experiments of the same kind on boats on the Potomac River in 1882 and succeeded in sending signals up to 1% miles.

The results were regarded at the time as merely the effects of induction, but the system certainly contained some of the elements of radio telegraphy. GUGLIELMO MARCONI Hertz and his colleagues were not greatly impressed with the importance of the discovery of electromagnetic waves, but others began to see the possibility that there could be practical applications for this newly discovered phenome- non. Near Bologna, Italy, a Young man only twenty years of age, named Guglielmo Marconi (1874-1937), began in 1894 working with apparatus similar to that used by Hertz, with the definite purpose of using electromagnetic waves for communication without wires. Marconi had one great advantage over Hertz because of the invention in 1890 by Branly of Paris of a device called a coherer. Branly had discovered that when certain metal filings were subjected to high-frequency alternating currents their direct current conductivity was thereby increased. Marconi found that the coherer could be used as a detector for electromagnetic waves. He was able to improve upon Branly’s original invention by using silver plugs in a glass tube with a small gap between them which was filled with a mixture of silver and nickel filings. Marconi was not alone in his search for a method of wire- less communication. A Russian named Alexander S. Popov"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic Waves and Radio 201 described his wireless telegraph apparatus before a gathering of the Russian Physical Society in St. Petersburg in 1895. His equipment was very similar to that which Marconi was using and included a coherer as a detector. Popov claimed that he had sent a wireless signal a distance of 600 yards. Because of Popov’s address before the Physical Society the Russians have claimed priority over Marconi. Whatever the merit of these claims it was Marconi who developed the wireless telegraph into a practical reality. FIRST RADIO PATENT During the year 1895 Marconi was able to transmit wireless messages over a distance of a mile. He received a British patent in 1896. In 1897 a group of wealthy Englishmen, at the suggestion of Sir William Preece, head of the British Post Office, formed a company called the Wireless Tele- graph and Signal Company, which gave Marconi about &60,000 in stock and &15,000 in money for the use of his invention and retained him to carry on further experiments. By the year 1900 wireless signals were transmitted a dis- tance of 200 miles, and on December 12, 1901, Marconi received a wireless signal at St. John’s, Newfoundland, which had originated at Poldu in Cornwall, England. Many improvements were introduced as the result of years of experimentation, including improved antennas and far more sensitive detectors. Marconi’s first detector was the coherer. For his transatlantic transmission in 1901, he used the mercury detector that had been invented a short time before by Lt. Solari of the Italian navy. Various forms of detectors had been invented over the brief early period of wireless telegraphy, including those already mentioned plus the electrolytic, the magnetic, and the hot-wire."},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"volving high frequencies. Joseph Henry may have had some inkling of the need for tuning two circuits to respond to the same frequency. Multiplex telegraphs had made use of tuning at lower frequencies in order to separate the differ- ent messages coming over the same line. When Marconi applied this principle to wireless telegraphy, he achieved success. He was granted a patent on tuned wireless circuits that for many years was the basic patent in that field. CONTINUOUS WAVES The spark used by Marconi for his wireless telegraph pro- duced a series of damped waves on a broad spectrum. Such a signal would be strongest in the region of the natural frequency of the transmitter circuit but would include many strong harmonies on both sides of the fundamental or natural frequency of the circuit. Each spark caused a group of electromagnetic waves of different frequencies that de- cayed to zero very quickly followed by another burst and another, at a rate determined by the interrupter on the coil. The effect on the receiver was a tone determined by the frequency of the interrupter. This tone was broken into dots and dashes by the key of the sender. As early as 1892 Professor Elihu Thomson had discovered that a direct-current arc could produce undamped electrical oscillations. W. B. Duddell of England discovered in 1900 what was called the singing arc. Valdemar Poulsen of Den- mark applied the discoveries of Thomson and Duddell to produce high-frequency oscillations for use in radio trans-"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic \\I aves and Radio 203 mitters for which he received a patent in 1903. Fessenden used the Poulsen arc a short time later for wireless transmis- sion. Despite the development of the Poulsen arc, most wireless stations were still using spark transmitters, but they had been greatly improved in the meantime SO that interfer- ence was diminished considerably. Poulsen formed his own company in 1910, and in the same year the Federal Telegraph Company bought his rights for the United States. The United States Navy adopted the Poulsen arc transmitter in 1912 or 1913 and used it until the end of World War 1. The German Telefunken began using a form of arc transmitter as early as 1906, and Ger- many was therefore further advanced in wireless transmis- sion than Hritain or the United States. DETECTORS The principal forms of detectors in the early period of radio development were coherer, mercury, magnetic, hot-wire, electrolytic, and crystal. The coherer and mercury detector were mentioned earlier in connection with Marconi’s work. It is rather surprising that a number of kinds of detectors had been invented before there was any serious effort at wireless communication. An early form of magnetic detec- tor was devised by Ernest Rutherford in 1895. Marconi made two improved forms of magnetic detector in 1902. Altogether there were about a dozen forms of this type of detector. R. A. Fessenden of the United States invented the elec- trolytic detector in 1902, and W. Schloemilch of Germany discovered the same principle a little later. The hot-wire detector goes back to the year 1890 when Rubens and Ritter made suc11 a device in the form of a Wheatstone bridge. Fessenden received a U. S. patent on an improved"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"also, General Dunwoody of the United States Army found that a combination of carborundum and carbon made a very stable detector. Many other crystals were found to be good detectors especially galena, which is lead sulfide. After World War 1, and especially after broadcasting was begun, amateurs built crystal receiving sets in great numbers. THE EDISON EFFECT Edison had noted the blackening of his light bulbs in the plane of the filament and particularly near the positive terminal. In trying to find the reason for this phenomenon he had provided one of his lamps with a small plate inside the bulb near the filament that was connected to a lead-in wire. He found that a galvanometer connected to this plate and to the filament showed a small current, when the lamp was in operation, and that the plate was negative with re- spect to the filament. He discovered also that when a bat- tery was connected to the filament and to the plate, a current could be made to flow in one direction but not in the other. He noted also that when the battery voltage was increased sufficiently, a blue glow appeared around the fila- ment. The phenomenon, relating to the conductivity of the evacuated space in the lamp, called the Edison effect, was discovered in 1883 and was patented by Edison. Elster and Geitel in Germany began an investigation in 1882 of ionization caused by incandescent metals. About the year 1888 they carried out experiments with evacuated bulbs and rediscovered the Edison effect.

THE FLEMING VALVE William H. Preece, who was at the head of the British tele- graph service, about 1888 conducted a series of experi- ments with an Edison bulb containing a plate, in which he verified Edison’s discovery. Similar experiments by J. A. Fleming about the year 1890 yielded the same results, con- cerning which he read a paper before the Royal Society in the same year and another in 1896. It was during this period that the discoveries of Mme Curie, J. J. Thomson, William Crookes, Rutherford, Lenard, Planck, and others were being made. J. J. Thomson in 1897 discovered and identified the electron, which he called a corpuscle. These discoveries served to clarify some of the mysteries surrounding the Edison effect, the Crookes tube, ionization of liquids, and the spontaneous emissions from certain elements. Fleming’s interest in the Edison effect was revived as a result of the new discoveries and because of the Marconi experiments. Realizing that what was needed for the wire- less telegraph was a more efficient detector, he set about the task of adapting the Edison bulb to this purpose. He made bulbs in which a part of the filament was surrounded by a metal cylinder connected to a separate terminal. This device, called the Fleming valve, served as a detecfor and rectifier, but as a detector it was very little better than a crystal. The Fleming valve was brought out in 1904 and was covered by a patent.

He filed patent applications for two-element tubes in November 1904 and in January, February, and April 1905. These tubes had two plates or wings. On Octo- ber 20, 1906, before a meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers held in New York, De Forest made his first announcement of the invention of the three-element tube containing a grid. He called his triode tube the “au- dion,” but he apparently had no notion at the time of what a giant this new tube was to become.

These were connected through transformers SO that the plate of the first tube was connected to the grid of the second, and SO on. ARMSTRONG3 OSCILLATOR TUBE In the year 1912 a Young mari twenty-two years of age, then a student at Columbia University, made a discovery that again completely transformed wireless communication and made possible most of the progress which followed. The Young man was E. H. Armstrong, and the discovery was the fact that when suitable connections were made from the grid of a tube to its plate the tube would oscillate and would generate high-frequency alternating currents that could be used as the source of continuous electric waves. De Forest made the same discovery at about the same time, but Armstrong was given priority, although his patent was not filed until October 29, 1913. Besides Armstrong and De Forest, it appears that Round and Franklin in En- gland and Meissner in Germany had approached very closely to the same discovery at about the same time. The European war began in August 1914, and radio be- came a matter of great military importance. New develop- ments in radio came very rapidly but were often cloaked in great military secrecy. The radio telephone soon came into use for ship to ship, and ship to shore communication, but for long-distance work radio telegraph was still used almost exclusively. For suc11 long-distance communication the sources of electric waves were still the spark for damped waves, and the Poulsen arc for continuous waves. THE ALEXANDERSON HIGH-FREQUENCY GENERATOR R. A.

The first trials of the Alexanderson high-frequency generators were made in 1906, with somewhat indifferent results. Little was heard of high-frequency alternators until 1918 when a 200-kilowatt machine was installed at the American Marconi Company station at New Brunswick. Signals from this new station were strong and clear. The Marconi Company offered to buy exclusive rights to the Alexanderson generator, but the General Electric Com- pany was dissuaded from taking such a step. Finally, in 1919, a new company called the Radio Corporation of America was formed under the sponsorship of the General Electric Company to exploit the new device. Later the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the Western Electric Company, the Westinghouse Electric and Manufac- turing Company, and the United Fruit Company were in- vited to participate. In 1932 RCA became an independent corporation, and its stock was widely distributed. AMATEUR RADIO AND RADIO BROADCASTING When the European war ended in 1918, radio was back in private hands, and with the change came a wonderful new interest on the part of amateur radio operators. Many of these had been radio operators in the various navies or armies and had sufficient knowledge to build sending and receiving sets. These amateurs were licensed by the federal government and were assigned station cal1 letters. At first their messages were in international Morse code, but later they changed to voice. Their work greatly accelerated the development of radio, especially shortwave. The amateurs"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"Company established the first broadcasting station in the world, station KDKA at Pittsburgh. Within a very short time there were hundreds of such stations throughout the United States and in Europe. The American stations, how- ever, were privately owned and depended upon advertising for their support, whereas European stations were owned by the various governments and expanded more slowly. The response of the public was immediate, and almost everyone that had any mechanical ability was building a crystal receiver equipped with headphones. A short time later they were building single-tube receivers with power supplied by a six-volt storage battery, and after another brief period came multitube radios with amplifiers and loudspeakers. The storage battery was messy and caused acid burns in clothing, rugs, and floors. As a substitute for batteries the manufacturers soon provided rectifiers called battery eliminators, but these were not entirely satisfac- tory. There was a great need for radio tubes that would operate on alternating current. This need was satisfied in 1926 by the invention of the alternating-current tube by H. NI. Freeman and W. G. Wade of the Westinghouse Com- PanY. The growth of the radio industry was phenomenal. By December 1922 there were 569 radio broadcasting stations in the United States and an estimated 1,500,OOO to 2,500,OOO receiving sets. The broadcast and other frequen- cies were soon becoming crowded SO that it became neces- sary to establish frequency bands for various purposes."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic Waves and Radio 211 Regulation of the radio broadcasting industry was essential, particularly in the matter of frequency allocation but also in the power allowed to any one station. REGULATION OF RADIO As early as 1910 Congress had passed the Wireless Ship Act, which set forth requirements for wireless on ships and regu- lated its use. An international conference on radiotelegra- phy, held in Berlin in 1906, had issued certain regulations governing wireless that were agreed to by a11 of the impor- tant countries. In 1912 Congress passed the Radio Act, under which the secretaries of commerce and labor were made responsible for the licensing of radio stations and radio operators. Experimental broadcasting was approved in 1919 for limited commercial stations on a wavelength of 360 meters. The first National Radio Conference, held in 1922, made certain recommendations as a result of which the secretary of commerce issued new regulations governing broadcasting stations. These regulations provided for a minimum power of 500 watts with a maximum of 1000 watts and permitted frequencies between 750 and 833 kilocycles. After the National Radio Conferences of 1923 and 1924, the Depart- ment of Commerce allocated the frequency band between 550 and 1500 kilocycles to radio broadcast and permitted power up to 5000 watts. Despite a11 attempts to tope with the tremendous increase in the number of radio broadcast stations, regulation was falling far behind the needs of the industry, SO that interference between stations was wide- spread, especially after sunset. The fourth National Radio Conference, called in 1925, asked for limitations on broadcast time and station power,"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"the LMI-White Act of 1927, which established the Federal Radio Commission. This commission had regulatory powers over radio, including the issuing of licenses, allocation of frequencies, and the control of station power. The act also empowered the secretary of commerce to inspect radio stations, to examine and license radio operators, and to assign station cal1 letters. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION In 1933 the secretary of commerce appointed an inter- departmental committee to study and report on the na- tional and international radio situation. The committee recommended that a commission be established with broad powers to regulate communications of a11 kinds. In 1934 the Congress passed an act establishing the Federal Com- munications Commission, or FCC as it is generally known. Although the commission was empowered to regulate a11 forms of communication, its most pressing problems were in the field of radio and television, which was just begin- ning. The new commission succeeded admirably in bringing order into what had long been a very confused situation. The discussion here has dealt only with the United States, but the problem was worldwide, and a11 other nations found it necessary to adopt regulations similar to those described for the United States. From time to time inter- national agreements regulating radio were made particularly in the matter of assigned frequencies."},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic Waves and Radio 213 FREQUENCY ALLOCATIONS At the present time the frequencies assigned to AM radio broadcast lie in the band between 535 and 1605 kilocycles, and for FM broadcast between 88 and 108 megacycles, with a total of 100 channels. Certain stations are permitted to broadcast during daylight hours only, whereas other large and important stations are assigned to clear channels and 24-hour service, with power up to 50,000 watts. Cal1 letters have been established by international agreement, and for the United States broadcast stations east of the Mississippi, in general, have cal1 letters beginning with W, and those west of the Mississippi beginning with K. FM stations carry the suffix FM after the cal1 letters. In addition to broadcast radio and TV the FCC has allo- cated frequency bands to a host of other applications in- cluding Safety Services (aviation, marine, police, fire, local government, forestry, highway, maintenance, special emer- gency, state National Guard, and disaster), Industrial Services (power, petroleum, forest products, business, manufacturers, relay press, motion picture, industrial radiolocation, and telephone maintenance), Land Trans- portation Services (railroad, motor carrier, taxicabs, and automobile emergency), Amateur Radio, and Citizens Radio. In addition to these there are such other frequency bands as Government Radio, Radar, Loran, Ramark, and Radio Relay Telephone. RADIO RECEIVERS The improvements in radio transmitters were accompanied by corresponding improvements in radio receiving sets and particularly in the quality of loudspeakers. In the early receivers headphones were used almost exclusively, and they were followed by loudspeakers that were essentially"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"- - used by the transmitting stations, SO that by the middle 1920s the quality of reception had improved tremendously. A similar improvement occurred in phonograph recordings with the advent of electrical transcription and later with the change from wire to tape recorders. In addition to the improvements in the sound system there were equally important changes in the electrical cir- cuits of receiving sets. The early crystal and single-tube receivers used a regenerative circuit patented by Major E. H. Armstrong in 1914. The regenerative circuit was in effect a low-power transmitter that caused howls and squeals, due to heterodyning other receivers or transmitting stations. Heterodyning refers to the superposition of one signal upon another of slightly different frequency resulting in a beat frequency signal equal to the difference between the two. In 1919 Armstrong invented the superheterodyne circuit for which he received a United States patent on June 8, 1920. Some time elapsed before this circuit was fully appre- ciated but eventually it became the most widely used of any of the circuits. Another somewhat similar circuit, which was widely used for a time, was the tuned radio- frequency circuit invented by Louis Alton Hazeltine in 1924. Improvements and modifications of the superhetero- dyne circuit were made by Hartley, Colpitts, and Meissner. At first the radio-frequency stages of receiving sets were tuned by separate knobs and required a great amount of patience as well as luck in tuning in a particular station. It was thought that it was impossible to construct the variable"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic Waves and Radio 215 condensers and other components with sufficient accuracy to mount them on a single shaft, but this result was accom- plished after a time with the aid of small trimmer conden- sers. One of Armstrong’s greatest accomplishments was his invention of the FM system of radio broadcast. In the FM system the frequency of the signal is modulated rather than the amplitude. FM . is practically free from interference from static or other radio signals. FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION Before discussing television it Will be helpful to trace the development of facsimile transmission, which, in some re- spects, was the forerunner of television. About the year 1840 Alexander Bain of Scotland invented a crude method of sending facsimile over telegraph wires that contained cer- tain elements used in later facsimile and television, espe- cially the scanning principle. In the Bain invention, the characters to be sent were first set up in metal and were connected to one side of a battery. A pendulum carrying a metal stylus was set to swinging over the metal characters SO that the stylus made light contact with them. The other side of the battery and the pendulum were connected to the line. At the other end of the line was a similar pendu- lum and stylus, which traced the characters on a chemically treated paper. Th e pendulums served to synchronize the sending and receiving apparatus. Clockwork was used at both ends to advance the metal characters and the paper SO as to scan successive lines. There was great difficulty, how- ever, in maintaining synchronism, and because of the cum- bersome methods involved the scheme had no practical value."},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"lac covering a thin metal sheet and was picked up by a metal stylus. At the receiving end the message was tran- scribed on a sheet of chemically treated paper wrapped around a metal cylinder. Both cylinders were revolved by clockwork at the same speed, but synchronism was almost impossible. COMMERCIAL FACSIMILE Giovanni Caselli built an apparatus on much the same prin- ciples but with much greater mechanical refinement and operated his apparatus commercially over a telegraph line between Paris and Lyons for five years from 1865 to 1870. D’Alincourt made improvements upon the Caselli devices by using tuning forks for synchronizing. Further improve- ments were made about 1875 by Francis de Hondt of Chicago and William Sawyer of New York. PHOTOELECTRIC DEVICES Noah S. Amstutz of Cleveland demonstrated a facsimile apparatus in 1891 in which the transmitting device con- tained a selenium ce11 and the receiver reproduced the pic- ture in halftone by means of dots. The photoelectric properties of selenium had been discovered by Willoughby Smith in 1873, and its applications were improved upon by Shelford Bidwell, both of whom were from England. In the late years of the nineteenth Century, Dr. Arthur Korn of Germany improved upon the Amstutz apparatus"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic Waves and Radio 217 by introducing a selenium ce11 in the receiving set which acted as a relay or amplifier to reinforce the incoming signal and to overcome to some extent the sluggishness of the selenium ce11 in the transmitting device. This system was successfully demonstrated in 1902. After the invention of the vacuum tube, it became pos- sible to amplify the incoming signals even more. As a next step the selenium ce11 was replaced by the photoelectric cell, or photocell as it is now more commonly called. In the photocell various compounds of cesium, potassium, rubid- ium, tantalum, thorium, or zirconium were used as the light-sensitive material. These were deposited on a metal plate that was then enclosed in an evacuated glass tube with suitable connections to the outside. Some of the later tubes were gas-filled The new photocells responded much more quickly to changes in light intensity and covered a greater portion of the visible spectrum than had been the case with the older selenium cells. Another improvement of great importance to facsimile was the change to synchronization by means of alternating currents or radio signals. PICTURES BY CABLE H. G. Bartholomew and M. L. D. MacFarlane of England invented an apparatus that made possible sending pictures by table. The impulses from the photocell were first re- corded in the form of perforations in a paper tape that was then fed into a standard telegraph transmitter. A similar tape was made at the receiving station, which could then be put into a machine that reproduced the picture. By 1924 the Western Union Telegraph Company was fur- nishing regular picture service to newspapers. In the same year RCA sent pictures by radio to Europe."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"apparatus in which the sendmg station had a mosaic OI small selenium cells, each of which was connected by wire to a small shutter in a corresponding mosaic at the receiving station. When an image was focused through a lens on the selenium mosaic, each ce11 responded according to the in- tensity of light falling upon it. The corresponding shutters at the receiving end were deflected accordingly and pro- duced a crude reproduction of the original image. THE SCANNING DISK AND MECHANICAL TELEVISION Dr. Paul Nipkow of Berlin invented the first mechanical scanning disk in 1884, which was the forerunner of the various mechanical scanners used in television transmitters for many years thereafter. In general, it consisted of a metal disk having a series of holes arranged in a short spiral. As the disk revolved at rather high speed, light impulses were received through the holes, scanning the various parts of the picture to be transmitted. These momentary light impulses fell upon a selenium ce11 that was excited in accordance with the intensity of the light falling upon it. The small and rapidly changing electrical impulses from the selenium ce11 caused a neon light at the receiving station to change its light output accordingly. The light from the neon bulb passed through the holes of a scanning disk like that at the transmitter, revolving in synchronism with it. The light coming through the holes in the scanner fell upon a ground-"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic \\I;aves and Radio 219 glass screen and produced an image of the original picture. Television sets of this same general type with various improvements were in operation until 1933, but none of these was satisfactory or commercially useful. These me- chanical television sets operated at twenty-four frames per second, with sixty lines per frame. THE ICONOSCOPE Modern television had its beginning with the invention of the iconoscope by Dr. V. K. Zworykin, who at that time was employed by the Westinghouse Company but who later joined the staff of RCA. Zworykin’s patent was filed in the United States Patent Office on December 29, 1923, but was not granted until December 20, 1938. The iconoscope was the essential part of the television camera and was the first such device to scan a picture entirely by electronic meth- ods. The receiving apparatus, called a kinescope and now generally called a picture tube, was a modification of the cathode-ray oscilloscope invented by Karl F. Braun of the University of Strasbourg in 1897. In 1923, shortly after his invention of the iconoscope, Zworykin set up a transmit- ting and receiving station, connected by wires, operating at 60 cycles, with which he was successful in transmitting tele- vision pictures. On January 7, 1927, Ph’l F 1 o arnsworth filed a patent appli- cation covering an electronic camera tube, called the dis- sector tube, which in some respects was an improvement over Zworykin’s iconoscope. Although the essential parts and technique were at hand for electronic television, it had not yet been established that electronic television was superior to the older mechan- ical equipment. On April 7, 1927, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company demonstrated the transmission of"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"vision and took place between New York City and Whip- pany, New Jersey, about 27 miles distant. IMPROVEMENTS ON THE ICONOSCOPE Various improved forms of television tubes followed the iconoscope, beginning with the dissector tube of Philo Farnsworth in October 1934, the emitron by John Baird in November 1936, the orthicon by RCA in June 1939, fol- lowed by the image orthicon and the vidicon. There were similarities in a11 of these, but the later tubes were much more sensitive and covered a greater part of the light spec- trum. Al1 of them employed a stream of electrons from an electron gun to scan the image. This process of scanning is accomplished with remarkable accuracy by moving the elec- tron stream from side to side and downward line by line by means of electrostatic and magnetic fields. In the earlier tubes, including the iconscope and dissector tube, the light from the scene to be televised and the electron stream impinged on the same photosensitive surface. In the later camera tubes the electrons are directed toward a metal sur- face in back of the light-sensitive mosaic. This mosaic screen is made up of a deposit of microscopic globules of a cesium-silver compound on a sheet of mica. Although the coating of tiny globules appears to the naked eye to be continuous, the individual globules are actually separated and insulated from one another. The cesium-silver com- Pound has the property of emitting electrons when light falls upon it, and the quantity of electrons emitted varies"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Electromagnetic baves and Radio 221 with the light intensity. When electrons are lost, the glob- ules become positively charged. In the iconoscope and dis- sector tube, there is a metal plate attached to the back of the mica that behaves like a condenser plate. As the elec- tron beam moves back and forth across the cesium-silver mosaic, the positive charges on the globules are partly or wholly neutralized thereby, changing the potential of the back plate and causing it to give up a tiny alternating cur- rent of high frequency. This alternating current is then amplified and becomes the video signal. Other types of television camera tubes operate in a similar fashion except that the electron stream strikes a plate on the back of the mosaic, changing its potential to correspond with the changes in potential of the globules in the mosaic. It must be remembered that each charged globule holds a bound charge of the opposite sign on the metal plate di- rectly opposite its position, SO that there is a mosaic of bound charges on the metal plate and not merely a charge on the plate as a whole. In the image orthicon the electron beam is reflected back to an electron multiplier that serves to amplify the signal greatly. The image orthicon is about one hundred times as sensitive as the iconoscope and cari therefore be used in ordinary or subdued light, whereas the iconoscope required intense illumination. TRANSMISSION BY RADIO WAVES In order to transmit the information from the television camera by radio, the carrier wave must be modulated to correspond with tiny impulses received by the light-sensi- tive mosaic. Transmission of the signal is complicated by the need for sending out another signal at the same time to carry the sound. Roth signals are sent out by the same"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"spects resembles the camera tube, and reproduces the pic- ture on a fluorescent screen. Synchronism between the transmitter and receiver is maintained by means of a special signal at the end of each line and frame. Audio reception is of course exactly like ordinary FM reception except for the frequencies employed. While ordinary black-and-white television was perhaps the most sophisticated mass-produced electronic apparatus devised up to the time of its inception, color television is far more complex. In general, color television uses combina- tions of red, green, and blue to synthesize approximations to the colors of the spectrum. The camera for color television has three separate tubes, one each for the colors red, green, and blue. In the receiver there are three scanning guns, working in synchronism, which cause the red, green, and blue phosphors to glow in their characteristic colors. REGULATION OF TELEVISION AND CHANNEL ALLOCATIONS In 1941 the Federal Communications Commission estab- lished 525 lines per frame and 30 frames per second as the standard for the United States.

From it, directly or indirectly, came the X-ray tube, the cathode-ray tube or oscilloscope, the radio vacuum tube, the iconoscope and its successors, the kine- scope, a number of accelerators, the electron gun, and the electron microscope. The Crookes tube might properly be called a cathode-ray tube, but that term has for some rea- son been applied to the Braun oscilloscope. The Crookes tube, in addition to its importance as the ancestor of SO many other devices, led to the discovery of radioactivity. Essentially the Crookes tube is an evacuated glass vesse1 containing a cathode or negative electrode and an anode or positive electrode. The construction of such a tube requires only a skilled glassblower and a good air pump. Glassblowing is an ancient art, but the making of chemical and other scientific apparatus did not develop until the fourteenth or fifteenth centuries. The glassblowers of that period were hampered because of the lack of gas or liquid fuels. By the nineteenth Century glassblowing was far ad- vanced, as exemplified by the work of Geissler. Von Guericke produced the first air pump in 1654; con- structed of glass, it resembled a syringe. Similar pumps by Boyle, Hawksbee, and Smeaton had improved efficiencies. Later, still more efficient pumps, such as the oil-air pump, were made of metal. In the oil-air pump the space below the piston was filled with oil which served to eliminate the air that would otherwise be trapped."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 225 Figure 15.1 A Diagram of the Crookes Tube (Courtesy Burndy Library) The first mercury pump was made by Swedenborg in 1722, followed by mercury pumps by Baader in 1784, Hindenberg in 1787, Edelkrantz in 1804, and Patten in 1824. Geissler’s mercury pump of 1855 was capable of pro- ducing a vacuum of 0.05 millimeters of mercury. Topler improved the Geissler pump somewhat, but the Sprengel pump of 1865 was a great improvement in that it reduced the labor and attention required and speeded UP the rate of evacuation. The Gaede pump of 1907 was a rotary pump, mechanically operated, which produced a vacuum of 0.00004 millimeters. VACUUM TUBES BEFORE CROOKES The earliest experiments in vacuum tube phenomena were those of Picard and Hawksbee. Picard observed flashes of light in the space above the mercury in a Torricellian tube when the tube was shaken, and Hawksbee noted the fluo- rescence in an evacuated glass globe when it was electrified."},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"sure of about 2 millimeters. When a discharge from an elec- trical machine was sent through the tube, Faraday observed a purple glow near the anode and a dark space nearer the cathode. This dark space has since been called the Faraday dark space. Masson of France, who was one of the early induction coi1 makers, constructed a vacuum tube with two electrodes in 1853 and discovered that when a discharge from an induc- tion coi1 was sent through the partially evacuated tube a bright pink glow filled it. This phenomenon occurs with a pressure of about 5 millimeters of mercury. Theoretically the discharge from an induction coi1 should be a pulsating alternating current that would not be well suited for use in a vacuum tube. Actually, however, the secondary voltage is SO much higher when the circuit is broken by the inter- rupter than when the circuit is closed that the secondary output is almost unidirectional. Heinrich Geissler of Bonn made a great number of vacuum tubes that were shipped to schools, colleges, and other laboratories everywhere, where they were used for instruc- tion and entertainment. Most of these contained air at about 5 millimeters of mercury and exhibited the character- istic pink glow for that pressure. Others contained gases other than air, and some were made of glass containing metallic salts that fluoresced in various colors. Julius Plücker, also of Bonn, discovered in 1858 and 1859 that as the vacuum is increased the Faraday dark space be- cornes larger, and he noted the greenish phosphorescence of"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the .4tom 227 the glass. He also observed the effect of a magnetic field upon the discharge. J. W. Hittorf, one of Plücker’s students, found in 1869 that an opaque abject placed in front of the cathode cast a shadow upon the glass. Eugen Goldstein of Germany performed a long series of experiments with vacuum tubes of many shapes, having a variety of electrodes. He found that the cathode rays are emitted perpendicularly to the surface of the cathode, SO that a concave cathode would tend to focus the rays, but the sharpness of the focus was influenced by the residual pressure and the potential difference. He found that the properties of the rays were independent of the material used in the cathode, and he found also that the rays could produce chemical reactions. Cromwell Varley advanced the idea in 1871 that the cathode rays were negatively charged particles but with only partial proof. SIR WILLIAM CROOKES AND HIS EXPERIMENTS We have very little information about Crookes’s early ex- periments with the vacuum tube that now bears his name, but it appears that he must have begun his work during the 1860s because it was reported that he demonstrated his paddle wheel experiment in 1870. In this experiment he provided two rails inside the tube on which the axle of the paddle wheel could roll. In this experiment the paddle wheel, which had four vanes, was made to turn by the bombardment of what Crookes later called molecular light or radiant matter, emanating from the cathode. Crooke’s later tubes were constructed by a skilled instru- ment maker named Gimingham and were undoubtedly the finest SO far produced.

In addition to the facts already known, Crookes found that the character of the discharge changed as the degree of exhaustion increased. The first discharge occurred in the form of bluish streamers when the pressure reached about 10 millimeters of mercury. At about 5 millimeters the tube was completely filled by a pink glow. At about 2 millimeters the Faraday dark space appeared near the anode, and there was a bluish negative glow near the cathode. At successively lower pressure steps, striations appeared in the vicinity of the anode stretching out toward the cathode, and another dark space, now called the Crookes dark space, appeared surrounding the cathode. The dark space was in turn surrounded by the blue negative glow. As the pressure was further reduced, the Crookes dark space increased in size until finally it encompassed the en- tire tube. Crookes speculated that the dark space near the cathode was a region in which the cathode rays had a free path before colliding with gas molecules. The blue negative glow was caused by these collisions. This theory was later confirmed, and it was found that the cathode-ray particles, later called electrons, had enormous velocities of some tens of thousands of miles per second as they were shot out from the cathode. Other inventions or discoveries by Sir William Crookes included the radiometer in 1875 and the spinthariscope in the early 1900s. He also observed the fluorescence of var- ious minerals under the influence of ultraviolet light from his tube. Crookes was above a11 a chemist of considerable stature and was the discoverer of the element thallium. LATER DEVELOPMENTS IN CATHODE RAYS Jean Perrin of Paris in 1875 confirmed Varley’s hypothesis that cathode rays were negatively charged particles. Hein-"},{"pageNumber":248,"pageContent":"230 Chapter Fifteen rich Hertz and his assistant P. Lenard succeeded in passing cathode rays through an aluminum window at the end of the tube opposite the cathode and found that the rays were capable of producing fluorescence outside the tube. J. J. Thomson in 1897 found the ratio of the charge e to the mass m of the corpuscle, as he called the electron, and he found also that after leaving the cathode these particles travel at a speed of about one-fifth of the velocity of light, depending upon the applied voltage and the degree of ex- haustion of the tube. In 1906, Millikan, by means of his oil drop experiments, was able to determine the value of e as -1.609 X 10-19 coulombs. When this value was substi- tuted in Thomson’s value for e/m Millikan found the mass of the electron to be 9.1072 X lO-‘* gram. The term electron was first suggested by Dr. G. Johnstone Stoney as a name for the natural unit of electricity in 1891. Later he applied the term to the cathode-ray particles that J. J. Thomson called corpuscles. It was not until the year 1900, or a little later, that the name came into general use. X RAYS Among the many descendants of the Crookes tube was the X-ray tube. On November 8, 1895, Wilhelm Conrad R&it- gen, a professor of physics at Würzburg University, was experimenting with a Crookes tube when he discovered that a screen coated with a thin layer of barium platinocyanide lying nearby fluoresced when the tube was operating. He found that abjects placed between the tube and the screen cast shadows upon the screen that were darker for abjects of greater density . When the hand was interposed, the bones cast darker shadows than the flesh.

For several years after Rontgen’s discovery, there was a difference of opinion among scientists as to whether X rays were particles or very short electromagnetic waves. It be- came clear after a time that they were probably electromag- netic waves, but the matter was not definitely settled until about 1912, when Max von Laue of Berlin with his associ- ates Friedrich and Knipping performed the crucial experi- ment in which X rays in a small beam were allowed to fa11 upon a thin crystal where they were diffracted. The dif- fracted rays falling upon a photographie plate exhibited symmetrical patterns about a dark central spot. Von Laue’s experiment led W. H. Bragg and his son W. L. Bragg of London University to extend the experiment by using a crystal lattice to obtain an X-ray spectrogram. lnstead of sending the X rays through a small hole in a lead plate to obtain a fine beam, they used slits; and instead of sending the X rays through a crystal, they reflected them from the face of a crystal. The crystal was mounted SO that it could be rotated about an axis at the point at which the X rays were incident upon the crystal face. A strip of pho- tographic film was arranged in an arc of a circle whose tenter was the axis upon which the crystal rotated. The spectrogram obtained by this method was similar to that made by a spectroscope with ordinary light. The lines on the spectrogram were due to X rays of different wave- lengths reinforced by reflections from deeper layers of the crystal lattice. Since the thickness of the layers could be determined, it became possible to find the wavelengths of the X rays. Even more important was the fact that an ar- rangement of this kind made it possible to study the struc- ture of crystals."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 233 Many improvements were made in X-ray tubes, some of which came soon after Rontgen’s discovery, but the most important improvement was made by William D. Coolidge of the General Electric Company in 1913, when he substi- tuted a hot filament cathode for the cold cathode used previously. The Coolidge X-ray tube provided many more electrons than the older tubes and was much more efficient. The source of electrons in the cold cathode tubes was prin- cipally the small amount of residual gas. Since the Coolidge X-ray tube had no need of this gas it could be evacuated to the highest degree possible. X rays were used in the Vienna hospitals within a few weeks after Rontgen’s discovery and were soon in use for medical purposes everywhere. Many other uses were found such as metallography, crystallography, detection of hidden abjects, and a very important use in the advancement of research in atomic physics. RADIOACTIVITY After the discovery of X rays, there was great interest in the possibility that other still unknown kinds of radiation might exist. Scientists were spurred on also by Hertz’s dis- covery of radio waves and by the particles known to exist in a Crookes-tube stream. Henri Becquerel of Paris tried wrapping various minerals in black paper and placing them on photographie plates to determine whether or not there was natural radiation from such minerals. He found that uranium compounds did cause a blackening of the plates. On February 24,1896, he delivered a lecture on the subject before the French Académie des Sciences in which he men- tioned the facts that, not only the compounds of uranium, but the metal itself caused the plates to darken and that"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"234 Chapter Fifteen the radiation, whatever its nature, would discharge either a positively or negatively charged electroscope. Within a short time G. C. Schmidt and Mme Marie Curie discovered that thorium produced effects similar to ura- nium and that other elements showed slight radioactivity. In Bohemia, at Joachimsthal, there was a mining operation in which pitchblende was extracted, from which uranium was recovered. Mme Curie had found that the residue, after the extraction of uranium, was radioactive and ar- ranged with the Austrian government to obtain about a ton of the material. She and her husband Pierre set to work on a long chemical process of refining and re-refining the pitch- blende to produce an increasing concentration of the radio- active substance. In 1898 they discovered the element polo- nium (atomic weight 210) and five months later discovered radium (atomic weight 226). Polonium, named after Mme Curie’s native country, is highly radioactive but has a half- life of only 140 days. Radium, on the other hand, has a half-life of 1600 y ears. Various other radioactive substances were found within a short time including radon and actin- ium. Radon was an emanation from radium but was found to be an element with an atomic weight of 222. The radia- tion from radioactive elements was found to be of three kinds, called alpha, beta, and gamma rays. Becquerel found that beta rays were negatively charged particles moving at high velocity. Ernest Rutherford identified the alpha rays in 1899 as slower-moving, positively charged particles. The gamma rays, as was the case with X rays, were not deflected by a magnetic field, and their nature was still a mystery. Gamma rays were far more penetrating than X rays and could be detected after passing through 30 inches of iron.

Only after von Laue in 1912 proved the electro- magnetic nature of X rays did it become apparent that gamma rays were also electromagnetic. SCATTERING OF ELECTRONS About the year 1903, Lenard had used thin metal foils to allow electrons from a Crookes tube to escape to the out- side and had noticed a scattering of the rays as they emerged from the foil. The scattering was different for each of the metals used and the rays formed patterns that varied with the kind of metal and the velocity of the particles. He deduced from these experiments that most of the mass of the atom was concentrated in a small part of the total volume of the atom. In 1911 Ernest Rutherford, who was at that time profes- sor of physics at Manchester University, announced the results of a long series of experiments on the scattering of alpha rays, later identified as helium nuclei, after passing through metal foils. Rutherford’s associates during these experiments, who carried out most of the work, were H. Geiger and E. Marsden. The source of the alpha rays was a bit of radioactive radon enclosed in a block of lead with only a small aperture on one side through which the rays could emerge as a narrow beam. A piece of metal foi1 was placed in the path of the rays, and behind the foi1 was a small microscope mounted on an arm whose axis was the tenter line of the foil. At the end of the microscope was a fluorescent screen that showed scintillations when struck by the alpha particles. The experimenters counted the number of scintillations per unit of time at various angles from the line of the beam, deriving a pattern in which the dots representing observed scintillations were more or less symmetrically placed"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"236 Chapter Fifteen Figure 15.4 Ernest Rutherford (From Smithsonian Institution)"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 237 around the tenter, Most of tbe rays were not deflected at a11 or very slightly. Rutherford assumed that the widely deflected rays had collided with one or more atoms. By means of very complicated reasoning and calculations Rutherford concluded that an atom is largely empty space and that most of its mass is confined to the positively charged tenter, later called the nucleus, which he calculated had a radius of less than 10-l* centimeter. He concluded that the positive charge on the tenter was exactly equal to the sum of the negative charges on the associated electrons. PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT The term photoelectric effect is somewhat ambiguous. Usually the expression means the photoemission effect, in which electrons are freed from metallic surfaces by the action of light. There are, however, two other photoelectric effects, called the photovoltaic effect and the photoco.nduc- tive effect. The photovoltaic effect was discovered in 1839 by Alex- andre E. Becquerel, fatber of Antoine Henri Becquerel. He had immersed two electrodes of the same material in an electrolyte and found that when light shone upon one of them there was a difference of potential between them of about 0.1 volt. In 1878 R. E. Day found that selenium exhibited a photo- voltaic effect. The photovoltaic properties of cuprous oxide were discovered in 1930 by B. Lange, L. 0. Grondahl, and W. Schottky. Photovoltaic light meters using silicon were introduced in 1954 by D. M. Chapin, G. S. Fuller, and G. L. Pearson, following a suggestion by Paul Rappaport. Willoughby Smith was the first to observe photoconduc- tivity in 1873; he found that small rods of selenium became better conductors of electricity when they were"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"238 Chapter Fifteen exposed to light. Other materials, such as cadmium sul- fide, were found to have similar properties by B. Gudden and R. Pohl in the 1920s. Heinrich Hertz of Karlsruhe, Germany, observed in 1887 that ultraviolet light falling on the electrodes of a spark gap would cause the spark to jump a greater distance. Hallwachs found, in the following year, that ultraviolet light falling on a negatively charged body would cause that body to lose its charge very rapidly, whereas a positively charged body was not affected. Ten years later J. J. Thomson and P. Lenard, one of Hertz’s students, discovered independently that light falling on a metal surface would cause the emission of negatively charged particles, later identified as electrons and called photoelectrons. For most metals only ultraviolet light Will cause photo- emission. The exceptions are the alkali metals such as so- dium, potassium, lithium, cesium, and rubidium. PLANCK% CONSTANT The same period that produced the important findings of cathode rays, radioactivity, and photoemission also brought forth a new concept relating to the energies of electrons or photoelectrons. Max Planck of Berlin had been studying blackb d o y radiation during the year 1900, and in the course of these studies he derived a theoretical formula that fitted his graphs of experimental results, giving the distribu- tion of radiated energy over a11 wavelengths for different temperatures. In the derivation of this equation he found it necessary to assume that radiant ehergy was emitted in very small dis- crete bundles called quanta and that the magnitude of a quantum of energy was hv, in which v was the frequency of the radiation and h was a new universal constant that he"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 239 called the quantum of action. The value of this new constant was determined by Robert A. Millikan to be 6.62 X 10mz7 erg second. PHOTOELECTRONS AND EINSTEIN’S EQUATION During the period from 1897 to 1905, a number of experi- menters made measurements of the velocities of cathode rays, Lenard rays, photoelectrons, beta rays, and rays from heated metals. Foremost among these experimenters was J. J. Thomson. Ethers were Lenard, Becquerel, Seitz, Stark, and Reiger. In carrying out these experiments, various indi- rect methods were used including magnetic deflection, elec- trostatic deflection, heating effects, and acceleration or retardation in electric fields. Albert Einstein, whose fame rests chiefly on his theory of relativity and his hypothesis regarding the mutual convert- ibility of rnatter and energy, made an important contribu- tion to the theory of photoelectrons in the year 1905. His proposition in this regard is expressed by the equation E = hv = W + ‘/mu’ . In this equation the energy E equals the product of the Planck constant h and the frequency of the photon v (the Greek letter nu), which equals the sum of W, the work required to free the electron from the metal, and its kinetic energy %mv2. Here m is the mass of the electron, and u is its speed after being freed by the photon. The value of v is determined by one or more of the rnethods men- tioned in the previous paragraph. The work W is a variable depending on the kind of metal used. It is least for the alkali metals and greatest for the heavier metals, as might be expected, because of the greater force holding the electrons in the heavier metals. The veloc- ity of the photoelectron increases with the energy of the photon.

Adding to the intensity of the light does not change the velocity of the photoelectrons but increases their number. HYDROGEN SPECTRA In 1885 J. J. Balmer studied the visible spectrum of hydro- gen and derived the formula h = 3645.6 [rz’/(n’ - 4)] in which h (the Greek letter lambda) is the wavelength of a bright line in angstrom units (one angstrom = 10-* centi- meter), and n is a whole number 3, 4, 5, . . . . It was shown that the empirical formula also applied with considerable accuracy to lines in the ultraviolet region. These lines of the hydrogen spectrum have since become known as the Balmer series. Rydberg modified the formula by expressing it in terms of frequency rather than wavelength giving the fol- lowing expression: l/h = 109,678 ](I/L’) - (l/n*)] in which l09,678=R, the Rydberg constant. STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM John Joseph Thomson (1856-1940), head of the Caven- dish Laboratory at Cambridge University (not to be con- fused with William Thomson, Lord Kelvin), mentor of Ernest Rutherford, had conceived of the atom as a posi- tively charged mass in which the electrons were embedded. This concept is sometimes referred to as the plum-pudding model. Such a mode1 failed to explain many of the known facts SO that Rutherford was forced, rather reluctantly, to the conclusion that the negatively charged electrons could be kept away from the positively charged tenter only by centrifugal force. This concept, however, led to another problem that was not resolved until some years later;"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 241 namely, a revolving electron, according to Maxwell’s equa- tions, should radiate energy. At this Point Niels Bohr (1885- 1962), a native of Copen- hagen, studied for one year at Cambridge under J. J. Thomson and the following year (1912) at Manchester under Rutherford. He returned to Copenhagen in 1913, where he completed and published his epochal theory con- cerning the structure of the hydrogen atom. Bohr’s mode1 of the hydrogen atom was based on Rutherford’s proposa1 that the electron revolves about a positively charged nu- cleus. He assumed that in any atom there were as many orbiting electrons as there were positive charges on the nu- cleus, and in order to overcome Rutherford’s objection, he postulated that as long as an electron remains in a given orbit there is no radiation of energy. He theorized further that an electron may jump from one orbit to another. If it moves to the next higher orbit, one quantum of energy is absorbed, and if it jumps to the next lower orbit, one quan- tum of energy is radiated. Bohr showed that in the hydrogen atom, which had only one positive charge and one electron, the electron had five or more possible orbits in which the forces within the atom were in momentary equilibrium. The radii of these orbits were related to one another in the ratio of their squares or as 1, 4, 9, 16, and 25. Normally the electron in the hydro- gen atom is in the lowest orbit, or ground state. When it is in a higher orbit, the atom is said to be excited. If sufficient energy is supplied to the atom from the outside, electrons are not only sent into higher orbits but may be freed from their atoms altogether as is the case in photoemission. By inserting the value of h in his equations Bohr deter- mined that the innermost orbit of the hydrogen electron had a radius of 0.5 X lO-’ centimeter and the higher orbits"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"242 Chapter Fifteen had dimensions in proportion to the squares of their orbit numbers. Furthermore Bohr was able to determine mathe- matically the wavelengths of the emission liAes in the hydrogen spectrum. His calculations agreed with the experimental results obtained by Balmer, and in addition Bohr calculated the wavelengths of the Lyman series of spectral lines in the ultraviolet and the Paschen series in the infrared, both of which had been determined experimen- tally in 1908. The Brackett and Pfund series in the infrared were found later. In a11 cases Bohr’s calculations agreed with the experimental results and established the truth of the Bohr theory almost beyond doubt. HEAVIER ATOMS, ELLIPTICAL ORBITS, AND SPIN For atoms more complex than hydrogen, theoretical solu- tions for spectral lines are a11 but impossible, because of the interactions of the orbiting electrons and such further com- plications as elliptical orbits and spin. In the heavier atoms the radii of the orbits are smaller because of the greater positive charge on the nucleus. Despite these difficulties there could be little doubt as to the validity of the Bohr theory and its applicability when it was extended to include the heavier atoms. Close examination of the spectral lines of hydrogen and other elements, particularly those of the alkali metals, re- vealed that many of the lines were multiples, SO close to- gether that it was difficult to separate them. Sommerfeld advanced the theory that in some instances these multiple lines were due to elliptical orbits of the electrons. In 1925 Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck proposed the idea that some of the lines, which were doublets, could be accounted for by assuming that some of the electrons were spinning about their axes."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 243 THEORETICALANDEXPERIMENTAL PHYSICSOFTHE1920s The period of the 1920s was one of tremendous progress in the development of atomic physics and quantum mechan- ics. In 1921 A. H. Compton discovered what is called the Compton effect. He found that when X rays were allowed to strike a carbon block other X rays of lower frequency appeared. These new X rays had different frequencies in different directions. Their lower frequency resulted from the loss of energy caused by each collision between an X ray, which behaved much like a particle, and an electron of a carbon atom. Louis de Broglie of France in 1922, advanced the theory that atomic particles have wave properties. C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer expanded de Broglie’s theory in 1927. The year 1925 was filled with announcements of new theories in the field of atomic physics and quantum me- chanics. W. Pauli set forth a rule in that year called the Pauli exclusion principle which stated that in any atom no two electrons may have the same quantum numbers. E. Schrodinger of Germany developed the theory that an orbiting electron is a wave packet made up of standing waves pulsing within the atom. The Schrodinger picture of the atom was extended by W. Heisenberg in 1925, by Born in 1926, and by P. A. Dirac in 1928. The theories devel- oped by this group were expressed in mathematical terms and were found to be consistent with the Bohr theory. More than forty years have passed since these theories were announced, and they are still generally accepted as valid. Bohr’s original concept of the atom was rather simple, but with the passage of time the picture has become more and more complicated. In 1912, about a year before the publi- cation of Bohr’s theory, H. G. Moseley, a Young Oxford"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"244 Chapter Fifteen graduate, using the X-ray spectrograph, found a relationship between the X-ray spectra of various elements and their atomic weights. On the basis of this discovery he deduced that the electrical charges on the nuclei of atoms were of the same order as their atomic weights. It had long been suspected that most of the mass of an atom was concen- trated in its nucleus. No longer was the nucleus of the atom thought to be made up entirely of positively charged pro- tons, but it was believed to contain neutrons as well. This new concept of the atom was soon to become very impor- tant. OTHER SUBATOMIC PARTICLES Theories as to the nature of matter were changing rapidly, especially after the finding of new particles. In 1932 J. Chadwick of England discovered the neutron, and in the same year C. D. Anderson discovered the positron. The neu- tron was described as a particle similar to the proton but without a charge. Chadwick’s discovery was aided by earlier research by Bothe and Becker of Germany and Irène Curie and her husband, Frédéric Joliot. The positron was a very small particle, similar to the electron but with a positive charge. Soon after the discovery of the positron, J. R. Oppenheimer succeeded in producing an electron pair, posi- tive and negative electrons, by the use of powerful gamma rays. A great number of other subatomic particles have been postulated to explain various phenomena, some of which perhaps exist and others of which may be different manifestations of more familiar particles. Awareness of the existence of cosmic rays started around the beginning of the Century. Their source is in outer space, but their exact origin is unknown. They consist of protons, alpha particles, and a smaller number of the nuclei of heav-"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 243 ier atoms. They have exceedingly high energies much of which is lost as the rays travel through the atmosphere. As they collide with air molecules thousands of secondary cos- mit rays are produced. In the course of this bombardment, positive and negative electron pairs are produced that re- unite immediately and are annihilated. A very interesting particle that is a product of cosmic ray collisions is the pi meson. The pi meson may be positively or negatively charged or neutral. It has a mass 275 times that of an elec- tron, and it may achieve a velocity close to that of light. Charged pi mesons disintegrate in a small fraction of a sec- ond to form charged mu mesons and a particle called a neutrino. The mu meson, in turn, decays in another small fraction of a second, producing an electron and two neu- trinos. The neutral mesons are very unstable and disinte- grate even more quickly than the charged mesons into two gamma rays. Since this is a history of electricity and magnetism, it would not be appropriate to pursue the subjects of atomic physics and quantum mechanics in great detail. Although these studies had their origins in electrical phenomena, they have now extended into regions only remotely connected with the purposes of this book. The remaining discussion of these matters Will therefore be brief and Will be in the nature of an outline. THE ELECTRON MICROSCOPE De Broglie’s and Schrodinger’s hypotheses of the early and middle 1920s indicated that electrons behave in some re- spects like particles and in other ways like waves. Hans Busch of Germany showed in 1926 that an electron beam could be focused by an electrostatic or magnetic field. Ernst Bruche and H.

Siemens and Halske built an electron microscope in 1935 based on a design by von Borries and Ruska, which had a resolving power of 100 angstroms. In North America, work on the electron microscope was begun in 1935 at the University of California and at Bell Laboratories. RCA Laboratories began its work in 1936 under the direction of Dr. V. K. Zworykin. In the same year work was also started at the University of Toronto. Electron microscopes may use either magnetic or electro- static lenses, but very few have been built with electrostatic lenses. Electron microscopes have been built commercially by Siemens and Halske and several other European manu- facturers. In the United States they have been produced by RCA and General Electric. In an electron microscope the entire system is enclosed in a chamber that has been exhausted to a pressure of 10-’ at- mosphere. Since the specimen to be observed is also en- closed in the vacuum chamber, its moisture must be re- moved. Because of this, biological specimens are greatly altered, and the usefulness of the instrument is thereby diminished. The electron microscope is one of the descendants of the Crookes tube. The source of the electrons in the micro- scope is a hot cathode that furnishes many more electrons than the cold cathode of the Crookes tube. In order to propel the electrons toward the lower end of the tube, it is necessary to provide a potential difference of from 10 to 100 kilovolts between the cathode and the target. The electron beam is brought to a focus at the specimen by"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 247 means of a toroidal magnet that behaves somewhat like a lens. The beam, after passing through the specimen, is brought to a focus at the screen, which is a plate coated with a fluorescent material. A photographie film may be substituted for the screen. An ordinary optical microscope is capable of magnification up to 2000 diameters, while an electron microscope may magnify up to 200,000 diameters, with a resolving power of about 10 angstroms. RADIATION DETECTORS Research in the field of radiation of both particles and electromagnetic waves was largely dependent upon the in- vention of suitable devices for the detection of such radia- tion and the showing or measurement of its effects. There is now a long list of such devices including the electroscope, the photographie film, the spinthariscope, the ionization chamber, the Geiger-Müller counter, the cloud chamber, the fluorescent screen, the scintillator, the bubble chamber, radio wave detectors, the radiometer, the thermometer, and the phototube. Al1 of these and others have played an im- portant role in the amazing list of discoveries which fol- lowed the invention of the Crookes tube and the discovery of radio waves, the X ray, and radioactivity. Radio wave detectors were mentioned in an earlier chap- ter, and others such as the electroscope, the radiometer and the thermometer have been used for many years. One of the most useful detectors for radioactivity has been the cloud chamber, invented by C. T. R. Wilson of Cambridge University in 1912 or perhaps somewhat earlier. In the cloud chamber, the tracks of moving charged particles be- come visible as they cause the formation of tiny droplets of water in a cloud of water vapor in a glass vessel. A cloud is formed in the vesse1 above the water in the bottom when"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"248 Chapter Fifteen the pressure is suddenly decreased by means of a bulb at- tached to the vessel. An ionization chamber is a small box or glass tube into which electrified particles are introduced, causing the en- closed gas to become ionized. When a battery and galva- nometer are connected between the two electrodes, a weak current Will flow through the ionized gas. This current Will be proportional to the amount of ionization and the bat- tery voltage and Will indicate the amount of ionization. The Geiger counter was originally invented by Hans Geiger between 1908 and 1913 and later was much improved by Geiger and H. Müller. The Geiger-Müller counter consists of a partially evacuated glass tube containing a short copper tube through the tenter of which a wire is stretched. The positive terminal of a high-voltage battery is connected to the copper tube, and the circuit is completed through a galvanometer and the central wire. In more modern instru- ments, the galvanometer is replaced by an amplifier and telephone receiver in which every ray that reaches the coun- ter is registered by a click. The bubble chamber is a much later modification of the cloud chamber, in which a liquid heated to near its boiling point is used in place of saturated water vapor. An electri- fied particle passing through the liquid leaves a trail of bub- bles. One of the better and more recent detectors is the scintil- lation counter; it is a combination of a screen that Will emit flashes of light when struck by alpha, beta, or gamma rays or by a11 three and a photomultiplier tube. The screen is placed in close proximity to the cathode of a photomulti- plier tube that is highly sensitive to light, especially in the blue or violet region. A tiny flash on the screen Will liberate one or more electrons from the cathode, depending on the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Crookes Tube, Structure of the Atom 249 intensity of the flash. Below the cathode is a series of screens arranged in zigzag fashion, positively charged, and coated with a material that Will give up electrons freely when struck by other electrons. As its name indicates, the photomultiplier tube produces many more electrons than the original number, SO that the collecter at the bottom of the tube receives an avalanche of electrons. A scintillation counter is a very sensitive detector that is also very fast, with a resolving time ranging from 10-’ to 10s9 seconds. ACCELERATORS AND ATOMIC RESEARCH Prior to 1932, the only method available for the disruption of atoms was bombardment with alpha rays from radio- active materials. Physicists generally were convinced that far better results could be obtained by accelerating atomic particles by artificial means. The energy of alpha rays from radioactive substances was limited, and the particles were projected in random directions, SO that they could not be concentrated on a desired target. Rutherford, who had observed nuclear disruption with the use of alpha rays in 1919, laid plans in 1930 for the con- struction of a million-volt generator, to be built at the Cav- endish Laboratory for use with an accelerator. Two of Rutherford’s assistants, Cockroft and Walton, became im- patient and in 1932 completed a smaller accelerator, using 150,000 volts. With it they succeeded in projecting protons from hydrogen at a velocity sufficient to disrupt the nu- cleus of a lithium atom, an event which was accompanied by the release of energy. Similar activities were under way at other universities. At Princeton, R. .J. Van de Graaff in 1931 completed a belt- type electrostatic generator that produced a potential of 1.5 million volts. Van de Graaff transferred to M.I.T. the"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"250 Chapter Fifteen following year, where he collaborated with K. T. Compton in the construction of a larger machine. They completed a 5.1-MV generator in 1936 that was immediately put to work on nuclear research. In order to overcome corona and moisture difficulties, more powerful generators were later housed in pressurized steel buildings. The highest voltage achieved in a Van de Graaff generator was 12 MV. At the University of California, at the same time as these other projects, work was in progress on a different type of accelerator, called the cyclotron. This project began in 1930 under the direction of E. 0. Lawrence. The cyclotron consisted of a flat, circular vacuum chamber inside of which were two hollow semicircular electrodes, called dees. The vacuum chamber was mounted between the poles of a powerful electromagnet. Inside the chamber, near the cen- ter, was a source of hydrogen ions that were accelerated by the high-frequency electrostatic field from the dees. The magnetic field caused the ions to travel in a spiral of in- creasing radius at enormous velocities until they were fi- nally ejected through an aluminum window. The first cyclo- tron was completed in 1932 and yielded only 0.8-MeV ions, but a 60-inch machine, completed in 1939, produced 40-MeV ions. The abbreviation MeV stands for million electron volts. One electron volt is the energy acquired by one electron when accelerated through a potential difference of 1 volt. At the University of Illinois, D. W. Kerst conceived and built an accelerator called the betatron because it produced a powerful beam of electrons, or beta rays, whereas the cyclotron yielded a beam comparable to alpha rays. Several previous attempts had been made to construct an electron accelerator, the earliest of which was made by J. Slepian in 1922, followed by Breit and Tuve in 1927, and Wideroe in"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Croohes Tube, Structure of the Atom 251 1928. Still other attempts were made by Walton, Jasinsky, and Steenbeck. The Illinois betatron was compl&ed in 1940 and produced 2.3-MeV electrons. The betatron consists of a doughnut-shaped vacuum cham- ber made of glass or porcelain, containing an electron gun, a11 of which is mounted between the poles of a strong alter- nating magnet operating at 60 to 180 cycles per second. Short bursts from the electron gun are timed to correspond with the proper phase of the magnetic cycle. Al1 of the electrons travel in a single path at the tenter of the tube, and herein lay the difficulty experienced by the earlier experimenters, who were unable to keep the electron stream stable. The electrons may spin around through the tube as many as 200,000 times in a quarter cycle of the magnetic field and travel at velocities approaching that of light. Not only is the betatron a source of high-speed elec- trons, it is also used to produce hard and very penetrating X rays. The largest betatron was built by the General Electric Company about the year 1946. It had a magnet weighing 400 tons and produced electrons with energies of 340 MeV. Another accelerator called the synchrotron is a cross be- tween a cyclotron and a betatron. It has a doughnut-shaped evacuated tube like the betatron, but inside the tube, in addition to the electron gun, are tubular electrodes corres- ponding to the dees of the cyclotron. Acceleration of the electron is begun on the betatron principle using the alter- nating electromagnet after which further acceleration is produced by the electrostatic field from the electrodes on the cyclotron principle. Some of these machines accelerated electrons to 99.99 percent of the speed of light with an increase in mass of 600 times the rest mass. A modification of the synchrotron, built at the CERN laboratory in Geneva in 1959, was used for accelerating pro-"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"232 Chapter Fifteen tons and was capable of energies up to 28 BeV (billion elec- tron volts). Another such machine, called the cosmotron, was put into service at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1960 and was capable of producing 33 BeV. The fifth important type of accelerator is called the linear accelerator because, as the name implies, the accelerated particles move in a straight line. Ising of Sweden proposed such a device in 1925 but did not actually build one. E. Wideroe, of Brown Boveri in Switzerland, built a small linear accelerator with three electrodes in 1928. It was fol- lowed a short time later by a machine with ten electrodes built by D. H. SI oan of the University of California. Others who worked on the problem were J. W. Beams of the Uni- versity of Virginia, who built a linear accelerator yielding 1.3 MeV. W. W. Hansen of Stanford University began his work on linear accelerators in 1930 and as a by-product invented the rumbatron, from which Russell and Sigurd Varian developed the klystron oscillator tube in 1937. After World War II, L. Alvarez and W. K. H. Panofsky of the University of California attacked the problem, and work was also resumed at Stanford University. On Septem- ber 9, 1967, a lO,OOO-foot linear accelerator became opera- tional at Stanford University. It was built by the university under the sponsorship of the U. S. Atomic Energy Com- mission."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"16 Microwaves, Radar Radio Relay, Coaxial Cable, Computers MICROWAVES Microwaves are radio waves with wavelengths lying in the electromagnetic wave spectrum between 1 meter and l/ie centimeter. They have properties quite unlike the radio waves used for broadcasting. These short waves are much more directional, are propagated in straight lines like light, and cari be confined within a tube or waveguide. Because of their very short wavelengths, microwaves require special equipment for their generation and reception. Ordinary radio circuits have components of capacity and inductance that render them entirely unfit for microwaves. Microwaves have been put to various uses, the most im- portant of which are radar and radio relay telephone cir- cuits. RADAR Radar was very largely a development resulting from de- fense requirements in World War II, although early forms of radar were in existence as early as 1934 and were in use along the British east toast several years later. The conception of radar was not the invention of any single individual or group but rather came into existence by steps with contributions by many research scientists. The pioneers in microwave development were Dr. Irving Wolff of RCA and 1. E. Mouromtseff of the Westinghouse Com- pany in the early 1930s. An essential part of pulse radar, the most common form, was the cathode-ray tube, whose ancestor was the Crookes"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"254 Chapter Sixteen tube. As was mentioned previously in connection with tele- vision, the cathode-ray tube was the invention of Karl F. Braun, who applied it to his oscilloscope in 1897, and it was this tube that became the receiving screen of radar and of television. The word radar was coined by S. M. Tucker of the United States Navy from the name Radio Detection and Ra+ng. Radar is essentially a method of detecting the presence of, and the direction and distance of, abjects not ordinarily visible because of darkness, fog, or distance. It also has the capability, in another form, of determining the speed of moving abjects and the direction in which they are moving. These results are accomplished by reflecting microwaves from the abjects under observation and receiving the re- flected signal by suitable means. In wartime use, radar served not only to detect enemy ships and planes but was used also to direct gunfire with incredible accuracy. The first discovery leading to the development of radar was made in 1922 by engineers of the U. S. Naval Research Laboratory when they observed that radio waves were re- flected back to the transmitter by a ship passing between a sending and receiving station. Beginning with that observa- tion and continuing until 1930, the laboratory performed many experiments on the same phenomenon and con- structed primitive forms of radar using ordinary radio waves. EARLY BRITISH DEVELOPMENTS AND INSTALLATIONS During the 1930s when Britain was already aware that it might be vulnerable to attack from the continent, early forms of radar were installed along the eastern and southern toasts of the island. In 1936 there were five such stations;"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Ca})le, Computers 25.5 in 1937 there were twenty, and more were added in 1938 and 1939. These installations used a wavelength of 1.5 me- ters, the shortest length which was possible by the then- existing equipment. The person chietly responsible for this work was Robert Alexander Watson-Watt. The British realized that to be most effective radar required much shorter wavelengths, especially for airborne radar. The prob- lem was submitted to a research team at the University of Birmingham, which about the year 1940 produced an early form of the magnetron oscillator. AMERICAN WARTIME RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT When the war began in 1939, various of the research labora- tories of American companies took up the radar problem in earnest. Among those working on this problem were RCA, General Electric, Westinghouse, Bell Laboratories, Western Electric, Philco, Raytheon, Hazeltine, Sperry, Federal Tele- phone, Bendix, and others. In 1940 the Radiation Laboratory was established at M.I.T., which had on its roster most of the men in the United States who had knowledge of microwaves. This or- ganization worked closely with its British counterparts and with the various radio manufacturers to develop and pro- duce as quickly as possible the most effective radar equip- ment within their capabilities. The British contributed their version of the magnetron tube, which was improved upon and was soon produced in quantity by the General Electric Company. Between the work of the Radiation Laboratory and the research organizations of the manu- facturing companies, progress was little short of miraculous, SO that what might have taken years to develop was done in months. The elapsed time between laboratory experi-"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"256 Chapter Sixteen ment and operation on the war front was sometimes a matter of weeks. NEW OSCILLATORS AND OTHER TUBES Radar made necessary the production of hundreds of new types of vacuum tubes unlike anything previously manu- factured. The reason was, of course, that the inherent capacitance and inductance of the older tubes rendered them unfit for microwaves. Furthermore, the transit time of electrons moving from cathode to plate in an ordinary tube was SO great that the grid voltage might be reversed before the electron had traversed more than a part of the required distance, and the tube would become inoperative. The parts of the microwave tubes had to be made much smaller and closer together than in the standard tubes. There was an even greater problem involved in the manu- facturing of oscillator tubes because these were required to put out rather large amounts of power and still have in- ternal characteristics suitable for microwave operation. Three general types of such tubes were made: the light- house tube, so-named because of its shape, for smaller power output; the magnetron for large power output; and the klystron, a versatile kind of tube with a wide frequency range, used for both transmitters and receivers. The lighthouse tube cari operate up to 4000 megacycles, at relatively low power. The magnetron, which uses a strong permanent magnet to cause the electrons issuing from the cathode to move in circular orbits within several chambers, is capable of producing waves with wavelengths of 1 centi- meter or less and cari reach peak outputs measured in mega- watts. The klystron like the magnetron has cavity reson- ators but is adjustable over a much wider range and is there-"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Gable, Computers 257 fore suitable as an oscillator tube for FM as well as micro- wave transmission and reception. TYPES OF RADAR In the earliest radar sets the pulse system was used, and this system is still the most common. Signals from the trans- mitter are beamed toward the target in pulses only a few microseconds in length, each of which is followed by a pause of much greater duration. The pulse repetition fre- quency (PRF) may vary from 60 to 4000 per second. The pulse repetition time (PRT) may therefore vary between 16,667 and 250 microseconds (millionths of a second). The duration of a single pulse is often only a fraction of 1 per- cent of the time between pulses, which means that the peak output of an oscillator tube may be several thousand times its average power. In most cases radar is used to scan the entire 360 degrees around the transmitter, and for that reason a rotating or sweep antenna is used. The return signal is generally re- ceived by the same antenna, which in the meantime has rotated through a small angle depending upon the distance of the target. The received signal is heterodyned, amplified, and demodulated, after which the pulses are fed into a cathode-ray tube where the target Will appear in white against a greenish background. The screen is provided with suitable markings, to indicate distance and orientation. Two other types of radar have been developed called FM, and frequency shift radar. In FM radar the frequency changes constantly through a predetermined range, cor- responding to the pulse in pulse radar. The distance of the target is determined by the beat frequency between the incoming and outgoing signals, and may be read directly on suitably calibrated instruments."},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"258 Chapter Sixteen Frequency shift radar is of the pulse type, designed specif- ically to measure the speed of a moving target by utilizing the Doppler effect. The reflected signal from the moving target is received by the same antenna as the outgoing sig- nal. The received signal is then compared with the constant frequency of an oscillator other than the transmitter, and by means of suitably calibrated instruments the speed of the target cari be read directly. This is the type of radar used by highway police. OTHER USES OF RADAR The use of radar during World War II helped save England and contributed to the destruction of the enemy. Since that time the military uses of radar have been greatly expanded and refined. Many peacetime applications have been intro- duced, such as marine navigation, airport landing devices, police radar, and weather forecasting. TELEPHONE RADIO RELAY Perhaps the most important peacetime application of microwaves was in the telephone industry for what is called Telephone Radio Relay. Ordinary long radio waves had been used for a number of years for voice communication, facsimile transmission, teletypewriter service, network tele- vision and radio, and telemetering. Telephone Radio Relay was first introduced in the United States by the Bell System in 1947, using the 4000-mega- cycle band. In such a system microwaves are sent from a terminal, through a directional antenna, to a tower some miles distant. Here the signal is amplified and may be changed in frequency, after which it is sent on to a second tower, and SO on, until it is received at the distant terminal. The relay towers are about 30 miles apart and are purposely"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Gable, Computers 259 set in zigzag fashion to prevent what is called overreach, which means the picking up of a signal by a more distant tower instead of the nearer one for which it was intended. FREQUENCY BAND ALLOCATIONS In 1949 the Federal Communications Commission allocated three frequency bands for telephone radio relay communi- cation: 4000, 6000, and 11,000 megacycles, each of which was 500 to 600 Mc in width. In the early experimental use of the 4000-Mc band there were six channels each of which was capable of providing 480 circuits. In 1959 the same frequency band was divided into twelve channels, and more recently each of these channels was made capable of provid- ing 900 circuits, making a total of 10,800 circuits in the 4000-Mc band alone. In practice two of the channels are reserved for standby, leaving 9000 working circuits. Still more recent improvements, involving the use of transistors, Will increase the capacity of each channel to 1200 circuits. When the 4000-Mc band began to approach the limit of its capability, work was begun on the use of the 6000-Mc band, which was divided into eight channels, two of which were standby. Each h c annel furnished 1800 circuits, making a total of 10,800 working circuits. Both the 4000-Mc and 6000-Mc bands have been used principally for 1 ong-distance service, between important terminals, but more recently a portion of the 6000-Mc band has been used for what is called short-haul service. The capabilities of the ll,OOO-Mc band have probably not been fully developed up to this time. This band is less ef- ficient than either the 4000- or 6000-Mc band for the rea- son that the very short waves have a shorter range and are weakened by the presence of raindrops in the atmosphere. The ll,OOO-Mc band has therefore been used primarily for"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"260 Chapter Sixteen short-haul service, especially in dry areas. It cari supply 600 circuits over distances of 200 miles in dry regions and 100 miles elsewhere, but repeater stations are much closer than with the longer wavelengths. T O provide the large number of circuits per channel the microwave is modulated by the signal and by a carrier wave, and in addition the outgoing signals are polarized horizon- tally and vertically. At the receiving end the signals are filtered out and reappear as ordinary telephone messages in the telephone exchange. The relay towers have two sets of antennas, one for sending and one for receiving, and a two- way telephone conversation follows two different paths be- tween stations. COAXIAL CABLE Coaxial table was invented by two Bell System engineers in the 1920s: Herman A. Affel and Lloyd Espenschied, who applied for a patent in 1929. The capabilities of such a table were demonstrated experimentally in 1936 by a line between New York and Philadelphia. In 1941 the first com- mercial coaxial table was laid between Minneapolis and Stevens Point, Wisconsin, a distance of 195 miles. This in- stallation originally provided 480 two-way telephone cir- cuits. This table contained four coaxial tubes; two of which were for standby. A coaxial tube consists of a 3/s -inch copper pipe in the tenter of which is a No. 10 copper wire. The wire is held in place by perforated plastic disks spaced about 1 inch apart. At least two coaxial tables are required for a line: one for outgoing and the other for return signals. At the present time tables containing up to twenty tubes are being manu- factured. The sheath for such a table is made up of layers of polyethylene and lead and is sometimes protected by an"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Gable, Computers 261 outer armor of steel tape. Inside the table and alongside the coaxial tubes insulated wires are placed for use by main- tenance crews to enable them to communicate with stations along the route. Generally the tables are buried in trenches, but sometimes they are carried overhead for short dis- tances. The trench also contains ground wires placed on either side of and above the table for lightning protection. The original Minneapolis-Stevens Point line operated in the 68- to 2788-kilocycle range with repeater stations 7.8 miles apart. This line had a capacity of 480 voice cir- cuits, later increased to 600. In 1953 a table was completed between New York and Philadelphia operating in the 312- to 8224-kilocycle range that had a eapacity of 1860 voice circuits for each pair. In this installation repeater stations were 4 miles apart. A more recent development was a 20-tube table, a test installation of which was made be- tween Dayton and Rudolph, Ohio, in 1965. A 20-tube table was put into service between Washington and Miami in 1967. It has a total capability of 32,400 circuits and operates in the 564- to 17,548-kilocycle range, with re- peater stations 2 miles apart. Experimental work is under way for the use of what is called pulse code modulation for use on coaxial tables, which is expected to increase the capability of these tables still further and Will eliminate distortion. There are at the present time about 15,000 miles of coaxial tables in the United States. Although radio relay handles almost a11 intercity television program transmission and about two-thirds of other long-distance communica- tion, coaxial table is growing more rapidly and presumably Will in the future account for a larger proportion of tele- phone traffic.

The Bell System is also conducting research on the use of laser beams for communication.

The earliest form of desk calculator was intro- duced by Pascal in 1642 and was used only for addition. A modification of the Pascal machine was made by Leibniz in 1671, and this machine was capable of performing multipli- cation. Charles Xavier Thomas of Colmar in 1820 was the first to make calculating machines commercially. The Thomas machine was not altogether reliable and therefore was not a success. The Brunsviga calculator, invented by Bohdner in 1876, was produced commercially several years later and was very successful. This machine, manufactured in Germany, could add, subtract, multiply, and divide and was the prototype of the many desk calculators of later years. The slide rule had its beginning with Gunter’s logarithmic scale in 1620. The sliding scale was introduced by Wingate of England in 1672. Lieutenant Amédée Mannheim of the French army introduced the modern form of slide rule in 1850. Probably the earliest integrator device was Amsler’s planimeter, which dates back to about the year 1854. It had been preceded by somewhat similar contrivances made by Conradi and Fleischauer. Computer development was aided by the invention of tab- ulating machines, using punched cards. The first such ma- chine was invented by Dr. Herman Hollerith of the United States Census Bureau in the middle 1880s. The 1880 census reports were delayed several years because of the vast amount of clerical work involved. Dr. Hollerith foresaw the possibility that future reports, because of their increasing complexity, could not be completed before the beginning of the next census. He conceived the idea of using punched çards to expedite tabulating the information gathered in the census. The idea"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"264 Chapter Sixteen was borrowed from the Jacquard loom, in which long sheets of punched cardboard were used to instruct the loom in the weaving of intricate patterns. Even the use of punched cards for statistical purposes was not new, because Charles Babbage, of England, had made such a suggestion as early as 1840 but had not carried out the idea. Hollerith began work on the punched tard system in the middle 1880s and within a few years had produced the equipment that was used successfully in tabulating the 1890 census returns. Business concerns began to adopt the system, and to meet their demands Dr. Hollerith formed a company in the 1880s called EAM for Electric Accounting Machines. The company was reorganized in 1911 as the Computing Tabulating Recording Company, and in 1924 it became International Business Machines, or IBM. Another company that played an important part in com- puter development was Remington-Rand Inc., which was formed by the merger in 1927 of the Remington Type- writer Company and the Rand Kardex Corporation. Rem- ington-Rand Inc. acquired the Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation in 1949. In 1955 Remington-Rand and the Sperry Corporation merged to form the Sperry-Rand Corpo- ration. Among the many products of the new company are UNIVAC computers, punched tard systems, tape, and other computer supplies. Beginning in the early 1950s many other American firms entered the computer field, including General Electric, Con- trol Data Corporation, Honeywell, Digital Equipment Cor- poration, National Cash Register, Philco, RCA, Raytheon, and Burroughs.

COMPUTER DEVELOPMENT Charles Babbage, who was born at Totnes in Devonshire, on December 26, 1792, was the son of a banker. He entered Cambridge University in 1810, where he became an out- standing student of mathematics. He was distressed by the fact that many of the mathematical tables of the time were full of errors. In 1812, with an open book of logarithm tables before him, he conceived the idea of building a com- puting machine that could be used to produce such tables and that would be free of human errer. For some years he spent much of his time in an effort to des@ such a ma- chine. As a result of his labors he produced a machine in 1822, which he called a Difference Engine, SO named because it was designed to calculate such quantities as loga- rithms and trigonometric functions for use in tables, based upon differences. This machine was capable of calcu- lating the values of simple equations to six decimal places. Babbage’s next effort was to build a larger Difference En- gine capable of making calculations of such quantities up to twenty decimal places, but he found that machine shop tools and technology of the time were not sufficiently ad- vanced to build a machine of this degree of complexity. In 1833 Babbage designed a different type of machine, which he called his Analytical Engine. This machine, to which Babbage devoted the remainder of his life but which he never succeeded in building, was a mechanical computer. It had four basic parts comparable with those of a modern computer. One of these he called the store, which was a limited mechanical memory. Another part he designated as the mil1 in which the calculations were carried out.

Babbage’s design called for having the machine print the results. In 1876 Lord Kelvin described an analog type of com- puter that was designed to solve differential equations, but this too was never built. The first computer to be com- pleted and put to use, excluding Babbage’s Difference En- gine, was built by Dr. Vannevar Bush and his associates at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This machine, begun in the middle 192Os, was completed in 1930. It was entirely mechanical, cumbersome, and slow, but it was capable of solving complex problems. Its greatest fault was that the time required to set up the machine, or in more modern terms, to program it, was very long. Copies of this machine were built in the 1930s: one for the Aberdeen Proving Ground and another for the Moore School of Elec- trical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. During the 1930s Dr. George R. Stibitz of Bell Telephone Laboratories designed and built a computer for use in the calculation of alternating-current problems involving the use of complex numbers. This machine used telephone re- lays instead of gears, cams, and levers employed by the earlier computers. Input to the machine was by means of a keyboard, and the output was delivered by a teletypewriter. Dr. Vannevar Bush and his co-workers completed a greatly improved computer in 1942 in which many of the opera- tions were carried out by means of electrical relays and switches but which still contained mostly mechanical counting devices.

M."},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Cahle, Computers 267 Durfee, and F. E. Hamilton of IBM. The project was fi- nanced by the U. S. Navy. This machine, called the Auto- matic Sequence Controlled Calculator, or Mark 1, was com- pleted in 1944. It contained electrical relays and switches but was still mostly mechanical. Input and control of the machine were accomplished by the use of punched paper tape, and the output was recorded by means of automatic typewriters. The Mark 1 computer operated successfully over a period of about fifteen years before it was retired, but compared with later machines it was slow. The calcula- tion of a logarithm, for example, required 90 seconds. A second computer, called Mark II, was begun by this group in 1945 and completed in 1947. It contained some 13,000 electrical relays and could store 100 numbers of 10 digits each in addition to a sign for each number. Input to the machine was by means of punched paper tape, and paper tape was also used as supplemental intermediate storage. Output from Mark II was recorded by automatic printers or typewriters. Its speed was much greater than that of Mark 1, but it was still very slow in comparison with later machines. DIGITAL AND ANALOG COMPUTERS Computers are of two general types, digital and analog, but the distinction is now rapidly disappearing. A digital com- puter, as the name implies, operates upon discrete numbers and performs arithmetic computations. An analog com- puter is capable of calculating transcendental functions or of solving differential equations. As its name indicates, an analog computer uses analogs such as voltages, resistances, angles, revolutions, lengths, or other measureable quantities to represent the actual amounts. A digital computer is"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"268 Chapter Sixteen exact, but an analog computer, because of the nature of the quantities involved and the kinds of measurements made, cannot be absolutely accurate. ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS The first electronic computer, called Mark III, or ENIAC for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator, was built for the U. S. Army under the direction of Drs. J. P. Eckert and John Mauchly of the Moore School of Electrical En- gineering. This machine, begun in 1942, was completed in 1945. It contained 18,000 vacuum tubes and 6000 switches and required about 150 kilowatts of electrical power for its operation. ENIAC was the first computer to use the binary system for a11 of its operations except the storage section. The storage or memory section consisted of energized vacuum tubes and was capable of storing 200 ten digit num- bers. Following the ENIAC the next important development was the IBM Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator completed in 1948. This machine also used vacuum tubes and relays and operated on the binary system. In England, where the earliest computer ideas originated with Babbage and Lord Kelvin, work on computers was going on also but at a somewhat slower pace. The EDSAC was completed at Cambridge University in 1949. This was the first computer to use a storage system other than vacuum tubes or mechanical devices and consequently needed far fewer vacuum tubes and therefore less power than its predecessors. Its memory system consisted of acoustic mercury delay lines. The EDSAC contained only 3000 vacuum tubes. The National Physical Laboratory in London completed the Automatic Calculating Engine or ACE in 1950. It used"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Gable, Computers 269 mercury delay lines and contained only 1000 vacuum tubes. A similar larger machine was built in the late 1950s. Back in the United States, the Moore School of Electrical Engineering built the EDVAC for the Ordnance Depart- ment of the U. S. Army in the early 1950s. It had mer- cury delay lines for its memory and contained about 3500 vacuum tubes. The EDVAC was designed to handle 44-digit binary numbers. Eckert and Mauchly formed a company called the Eckert- Mauchly Computer Corporation, which produced the first UNIVAC in 1951. This machine was equipped to use eight- channel metallic magnetic tape for its input, on which the instructions were encoded by means of a typewriter key- board. Its storage section had both mercury delay lines and magnetic tape. Output was recorded on magnetic tape from which the results could be reproduced in printed form by a special typewriter. The first computer to use transistors instead of vacuum tubes was the SEAC (Standards Eastern Automatic Com- puter) built by the U.S. Bureau of Standards at Washington in 1950. Except for the fact that transistors replaced vac- uum tubes, the SEAC followed to a large degree the logical design of EDVAC. The SEAC was constructed in place at the bureau, and was put in service in April 1950. Transistors had not reached the degree of reliability in 1950 that they attained later, and it was therefore not until 1958 or 1959 that computer manufacturers generally adopted the transistor. After the adoption of transistors, it became possible to reduce the size of computers very greatly, and power requirements were tut to a fraction of those of the earlier computers. Until the early 1950s nearly a11 computers had been built for government agencies or for universities. Later in the decade and especially after the advent of transistors, indus-"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"270 Chapter Sixteen tria1 and commercial concerns began to purchase computers in increasing numbers. The early computers were custom- built and were often designed for a specific purpose. With the widespread use of these devices came mass production and the designation of computer types by manufacturer’s mode1 numbers. MEMORY SYSTEMS Every calculating machine must have some sort of memory. It may consist merely of certain mechanical settings, as in the early machines, or energized vacuum tubes, punched cards, punched tape, electrical or acoustic delay lines, minute electrostatic charges, or, most commonly in modern computers, some form of magnetic memory. Magnetic re- cording had its beginning in a patent issued to Valdemar Poulsen of Denmark on December 1, 1898, covering a method of recording a telephone message on a steel wire by magnetizing the wire in tiny spots along its length to cor- respond with the undulations of the telephone crurent. Poulsen had little commercial success with his invention at the time. Following World War 1, wire recording apparatus came on the market, but the quality of reproduction was poor. Magnetic tape began to replace steel wire for record- ing in the late 1930s. Magnetic tape consists of a plastic base of Mylar or cellulose acetate 0.0007 inch to 0.0015 inch thick. The magnetic coating consists of a finely divided oxide of iron mixed with a plastic binder applied to the base to a thickness of from 0.0004 inch to 0.0007 inch. Magnetic disks or drums are made in a somewhat similar way; a binder mixed with an oxide of iron is applied to the surface of a disk or drum. In order to encode information magnetically on any one of these devices, a small electromagnet called the writing"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Gable, Computers 271 head is used, which is energized by electric currents under the control of punched cards, punched tape, or by other means. The same or a similar small electromagnet, called the reading head, is used to reproduce the encoded infor- mation. Magnetic cores are different, both in composition and method of application, from the other magnetic memory devices. Magnetic cores were invented by Dr. Jay W. For- rester and were first used around 1950. They are very small beads of ferrite material, strung on lattices of intersecting wires. When currents of sufficient strength are sent through these wires, the selected cores are magnetized in the desired direction. A current less than a certain threshold value Will not produce a magnetomotive force sufficient to change the direction of magnetization of a tore. In order to “pulse” a tore a current of slightly more than one-half the threshold amount is sent through each of two wires that intersect at the desired tore. The two electromagnetic fields combine at the one particular tore resulting in a change in its magneti- zation. The other cores along both wires receive less than the threshold current and are not affected. This process is called the “coincidence current selection system” and was invented by Dr. Forrester. The ferrite material used in the cores is an important dis- covery of Dutch scientists employed by the Philips Com- pany in Holland during the Second World War. Since that time ferrites have found many important applications, not only as cores, but also in high-frequency transformers. Per- haps the simplest way of describing a ferrite of the kind most useful in computer and other applications is to say that it is a compound in which one of the iron atoms in magnetite (FesOJ) has been replaced by a different metal- lit atom such as Mn, Cd, C O , Zn, Ni, C U , or Mg. The result-"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"272 Chapter Sixteen ing compound is one having the composition MnFe2 04, or NiFe 04, or other similar compounds with other metals, or in some cases mixtures of metals. Ferrites are not metallic but resemble ceramic materials in appearance, brittleness, and hardness. They are shaped by molding and grinding. The characteristics of ferrites that make them desirable for use in memory devices and for other purposes are that they have a nearly rectangular hysteresis loop, have high elec- trical resistance and therefore low eddy current losses, have high permeability, and have low coercive force. Their re- sponse to magnetic impulses may be measured in micro- seconds. The various kinds of memory systems have inherent ad- vantages and disadvantages involving such things as cost, space required, and most important what is called access time, or the time required to retrieve a given bit of informa- tion. Paper tapes, punched cards, and magnetic tapes are relatively cheap, but access time is rather long, because in the case of tapes the entire tape must be scanned for the desired information. Magnetic disks are also inexpensive but are limited in capacity, and access time is rather long. Mag- netic drums have shorter access time but are more expen- sive, and they are bulky. Magnetic cores are the most ex- pensive but have by far the shortest access time, and a vast amount of information cari be stored in limited space. INPUT AND OUTPUT SYSTEMS The input to a computer may be for the purpose of giving instructions or programming, or may be designed to give information to the interna1 storage or memory system. The method used may take many forms such as keyboard, punched cards, punched paper tape, magnetic tape, drums, disks, cores, or any number of other methods. In program-"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"Microwaves, Coaxial Gable, Computers 273 ming a computer it may be given new information, or it may be called upon to make use of its interna1 memory system. The output from a computer may also take many forms such as those mentioned for input, or the results may be printed or shown on a screen. The computer may also be used to perform such tasks as check sorting, check writing, directing the operations of a machine or process, billing, bookkeeping, on-line teller service, and hundreds of other operations under the general heading of automation or cybernetics. Utility meter readers now use special pencils to record meter readings, a process called mark sense. Such records cari be read by a computer that then prepares the bills and at the same time makes totals of whatever figures are desired. NUMERATION Calculators and the earlier computers used the decimal system. As work progressed on these devices it became ap- parent that a computer using the binary system was con- siderably less complicated and less expensive to build than one using the decimal system. Computers employ such things as switches, vacuum tubes, transistors, and many magnetic devices, a11 of which generally have only two states: on or off, positive or negative, or in general what is called flip-flop. Because these devices, as they are used in computers, have only two positions, they are therefore best adapted to the binary system, which uses only the numbers 1 and 0 in a very large number of combinations to represent any rational number. Each binary 1 or 0 in the memory system or elsewhere is called a bit. The number 9 in binary notation is 1001 and therefore consists of four bits. Dr. Stibitz employed the biquinary system (a combination"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"274 Chapter Sixteen of binary and quinary used to produce the equivalent of decimal numbers) in his 1937 computer. Some of the ear- lier computers had made limited use of the binary system. The ENIAC, which was the first electronic computer, still used the decimal system in its memory, but practically a11 later computers were entirely binary. At the time the ENIAC was under construction, Dr. John von Neumann, who was then at Los Alamos, Dr. Herman H. Goldstine, who was at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, and Arthur W. Burks of the Philosophy Department of the University of Michigan wrote jointly a series of reports on the subject of computers that became classics in computer history. The first of these appeared on June 28, 1946. This series of reports greatly influenced the course of develop- ment of computers, as for example, in the matter of stored programs and the use of the binary system."},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"17 Plasmas, Masers, Lasers, Fuel Cells, Piezoelectric Crystals, Transistors The behavioral characteristics of free electrons in the three states of matter have similarities as well as differences. A fourth state in which electrical phenomena may occur must be added, namely, a partial or complete vacuum. PLASMAS The term plasma has been applied in recent years to ionized gases. A wide range of conditions is embraced under the general term, ranging from gases in the sun and stars, whose temperatures are measured in millions of degrees, to the frigid outer atmosphere of the earth. Plasmas may exist at high temperatures and pressures or at lower values of both, but most of the familiar phenomena occur in the lower ranges. There is nothing new about the phenomena themselves since they include such things as the experiments of Hawks- bee with partially evacuated electrified glass globes, the glow of mercury vapor in the Torricellian tube, the electric arc, flames, lighting tubes using gases, the aurora, and many other examples. Plasmas are usually electrically neutral in that they contain equal numbers of positive and negative ions. MASERS AND LASERS A maser is an amplifier or generator of electromagnetic waves. The name is an acronym derived from the descrip- tive title Microwave Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. A laser is a similar device except that ordinary light waves are used instead of microwaves. Masers employ"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"276 Chapter Seventeen gases as a medium, while lasers may use gases, liquids, or solids. It is characteristic of masers and lasers to emit coher- ent radiation, that is, radiation that is almost entirely of a single frequency and that is of the same phase. The beam consists of rays that are SO nearly parallel that the diver- gence is only about one second of arc. The explanation of maser or laser action is to be found in Planck’s quantum hypothesis, Bohr’s theory of the energy levels of electrons in different orbits, and Einstein’s postula- tion in 1917 that it is possible to cause electrons to jump from one orbit to another and in the process to absorb or give up energy in discrete quanta or photons. As an exten- sion of these theories it occurred to several scientists that it should be possible to excite the atoms of a confined gas by applying outside stimulation in the form of electromagnetic waves. The stimulated atoms would then radiate electro- magnetic waves of a frequency characteristic of the gas being used. &y reflecting these waves back and forth there would be an increasing excitation of the atoms until the action ,became strong enough to deliver part of the energy externally. The external energy is supplied by the stimula- tion, and there is therefore no violation of the law of the conservation of energy. Among those who had been considering such matters were Nicholaas Bloembergen of Harvard, N. G. Basov and A. M. Prokhorov of Lebedev Institute of MOSCOW, and C. H. Townes of Columbia University. It was Townes who first succeeded in producing an operational maser in 1953. He and his students were already familiar with the microwave emission characteristics of ammonia gas. By stimulating the atoms of ammonia gas contained in a metal box, whose dimensions were such as to produce resonance at the re- quired microwave frequency, they succeeded in producing a"},{"pageNumber":295,"pageContent":"Masers, Fuel Cells, Transistors 277 strong microwave beam of a single frequency. The action was similar to that which occurs in cavity resonators such as the magnetron and klystron. In 1952 while Townes and his associates were at work on the ammonia maser, Basov and Prokhorov pointed out the possibility of constructing a “molecular generator” to a conference on radio spectroscopy. In 1954 they published the theory underlying a device such as the maser built by Townes, and in late 1955 or early 1956 they operated such a device. For their accomplishments in this field the Rus- sians shared a Nobel Prize with Townes in 1964. Maser or laser action depends upon the ability of the ap- paratus in use to propel a majority of the electrons, in the atoms of whatever medium is employed, into higher orbits. This process is called population inversion. The electrons in the excited state may have been lifted one step to the next higher orbit or two steps to the second higher orbit. In the first case we have a two-level device and in the second case, three-level. The original ammonia maser was two-level. In 1955 Basov and Prokhorov proposed a three-level gas maser, and the following year Bloembergen announced his ideas on a three-level solid state maser. Following the original ammonia gas maser, there were sev- eral years during which there appeared to be little progress in this field, but there was nevertheless considerable re- search, and many papers were written on the subject. In 1957 H. E. D. Scovil and his associates developed a para- magnetic maser, and in 1958 Makhov, Kikuchi, Lambe, and Terhune obtained maser action in ruby. The most impor- tant paper published during this period appeared in the December 1958 issue of Physical Reuiew written by Dr. Arthur Schawlow and his brother-in-law, Dr. Charles H. Townes, entitled “Infrared and Optical Masers.” The term"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"278 Chapter Swenteen optical maser was replaced by laser in 1960. The paper dealt with optical masers in general and also proposed the construction of a maser in which the medium was to be potassium vapor. A maser of this type was constructed but it failed. At a symposium on quantum electronics held at High View, New York, in September 1959, Schawlow proposed an optical maser in which the medium would be a solid in the form of a rod with polished ends and open sides. He used as an example a ruby rod and discussed its possible use in an optical maser. The actual construction of the first ruby laser was the work of T. H. Maiman of the Hughes Aircraft Company. It contained a synthetic ruby rod only 4 centimeters in length and )/2 centimeter in diameter. It was pumped by a spiral xenon flash lamp that emitted short bursts of light of about l/icee second duration followed by intense flashes of red laser light from the rod with a momentary power out- put of 10,000 watts. This achievement was announced by Dr. Maiman at a news conference in New York on July 7, 1960. After the first ruby laser there was feverish activity in many laboratories. More powerful ruby lasers were built within a few months, and the field of experiment widened to include many new types. For solid state lasers such mate- rials as neodymium-doped glass, neodymium-doped cal- cium, calcium tungstate, and dysprosium-doped calcium fluoride were used successfully in place of ruby. Other types of masers and lasers included semiconductor and single- and two-gas types. Liquids were used also. GAS LASERS At the Bell Laboratories three Young scientists, Ali Javan, Donald R. Herriott, and William R. Bennett, Jr., were en-"},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"Masers, Fuel Ce&, Transistors 279 gaged in research on a two-gas laser at the time the ruby laser was announced. The American Telephone and Tele- graph Company’s immediate interest in laser work was the possibility of using such devices in communications. The theory underlying this research had been conceived by Javan, and Herriott and Bennett developed the design of the apparatus, which consisted of a quartz tube 40 inches long filled with a gas mixture, at low pressure, containing ten parts helium and one part neon. Inside the tube at each end were adjustable mirrors to reflect the light back and forth. Pumping was accomplished by means of three elec- trodes on the outside of the tube that were energized by a radio-frequency generator. This laser first became operative on December 13, 1960, about six months after the ruby laser announcement. Other combinations of the noble gases were tried success- fully and also carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and cesium vapor. The gas lasers operate at low temperatures and are especially suited to communications work. They are generally very inefficient, but for the uses to which they have been put the low efficiency is not very important. APPLICATIONS Laser applications have been growing at a tremendous rate, and it would be difficult to foresee what the future may hold. Lasers have been built that have momentary power out- puts as high as a billion watts and are capable of welding, piercing, or fusing the hardest materials. They cari produce temperatures far exceeding those on the surface of the sun. Lasers are finding uses in surgery, dentistry, and biochem- ical research. One such use is in welding a detached retina. They are also used for making measurements of extreme accuracy, both microscopic and macroscopic, as for ex-"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"280 Chapter Seventeen ample the measurement of earth movements for predicting earthquakes. The frequency rate of lasers is SO precise that they cari be used to make time measurements that would be almost free of error over periods of many years. It is believed that in the field of communications it may be possible to transmit millions of messages simultaneously over a single laser beam, but there are still great difficulties to be overcome. Lasers Will very probably be another pow- erful tool in the physics laboratory as well as in chemical and biochemical laboratories. There cari be no doubt that mankind Will reap rich rewards from laser research and technology. ELECTROLYTIC AND ELECTROCHEMICAL PHENOMENA Electrochemistry had its beginning with the invention of the electric battery by Alessandro Volta. That discovery was followed shortly by the important researches of Ber- zelius of Sweden and the work of Sir Humphry Davy and of Faraday. Since that time great industries have been built upon these discoveries, and there has been steady progress due to the efforts of thousands of researchers. There have been no spectactular new developments in this field in recent years but rather a constant refinement of older methods. The most noteworthy recent developments have been the production of better types of primary bat- teries for longer life and greater reliability and new experi- ments with the fuel cell. . . The prmcrple of the fuel ce11 is not new, because as early as 1839 William Grove of England made such a ce11 using oxygen and hydrogen for fuel. What is new is the develop- ment of fuel cells into practical forms, suitable for certain limited applications. Up to this time the cost has been too great to compete with other forms of electrical generation."},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"Masers, Fuel Ce&, Transistors 281 Fuel ce11 efficiency is high as compared with that of steam or interna1 combustion engine plants, running as high as 60 to 70 percent, compared with 40 percent or less for the best modern steam plants. Fuel cells resemble other primary batteries in some re- spects but differ from them in other ways. Various materi- als are used for plates in fuel cells such as platinum or platinum-plated carbon. The plates are immersed in an acid, Salt, or alkaline electrolyte. Oxygen and hydrogen are fed into the ce11 where these gases combine to form water and in the process produce an electric current. The action is the reverse of that which takes place in the electrolysis of water. Other fuels such as propane, natural gas, methyl alco- hol, kerosene, and gasoline have also been used but at much higher temperatures. Fuel cells using acid or salt electrolytes operate at ordinary temperatures, but cells using certain alkalies may operate at the melting point of the elec- trolytes. Up to this time the fuel ce11 has had very limited applica- tions, the most noteworthy of which has been its use in space capsules, beginning about 1966. The Allis-Chalmers Company experimented with fuel cells in the 1950s for driving a tractor, but not on a commercial basis. Experi- mentation in this field is still in progress by many com- panies in the United States and Europe, but nowhere has the fuel ce11 reached the production stage. Because of its high efficiency there is hope that it may be possible to produce a low-cost design. An inexpensive fuel ce11 would have a multitude of applications, not the least of which would be the propulsion of vehicles. PIEZOELECTRICITY piezoelectricity is the name given to a phenomenon in which a crystal becomes electrified by pressure. The prefix"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"282 Chapter Seventeen piezo is from a Greek verb meaning to press. The effect was discovered at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1880 by Pierre and Jacques Curie. Piezoelectricity is closely related to pyro- electricity, a phenomenon discovered by Aepinus in 1756 and defined as electrification by heat that often occurs simultaneously with piezoelectricity. For many years piezoelectricity was merely an interesting phenomenon, and no practical applications were made of it until 1916 when Langevin attempted to use the principle as a submarine detection device but with little success. During World War 1 Walter G. Cady of Wesleyan University in Mid- dletown, Connecticut, discovered that mechanical reso- nance of vibrating crystals produced weak alternating cur- rents of corresponding frequency. This discovery led shortly to the quartz crystal frequency control devices used by radio stations. Beginning in 1925 the Bell Telephone System used crystals to control frequencies for its multi- channel lines. Piezoelectric crystals were applied to microphones and phonograph pickup cartridges, for which purpose it was found that Rochelle salts were admirably suited. Much of the research on these applications was carried on by the Brush Development Company of Cleveland, beginning in 1930. Around the year 1940 Arthur von Hippel and his col- leagues at Massachusetts Institute of Technology discovered the strong piezoelectric properties of crystals of barium titanate (BaTiOs), lead metaniobate (PbNb*Ob), and lead titanate zirconate (Pb(TiZr)Os). These crystals were soon put to use for many of the more common applications, but for frequency control and for wave filters the preferred material was still quartz."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"Masers, Fuel Ce&, Transistors 283 SOLID STATE DEVICES Some of the most noteworthy accomplishments in elec- trical science have corne in this field in recent years. The term solid state device is often incorrectly used as a syno- nym for semiconductor. The correct concept is much broader and includes besides semiconductor devices and ox- ide rectifiers such things as resistors, transformers, reactors, and such other devices as cari control electrical currents without moving parts, heat, light, or vacuum gaps. SEMICONDUCTORS The distinction between conductors and insulators has been a long-accepted fact, but the reasons for the differences have not been understood until recently, and even today there is a great deal of mystery surrounding them. Exactly how a current of electricity flows through a wire still pre- sents problems. It seems clear that there is a migration of free electrons from atom to atom, impelled by an electro- motive force. A displacement of one electron in an atom by another occurs, but it is also clear that this movement of electrons cannot take place at the speed of light, a fact which leads to the conclusion that the electromagnetic field is the real carrier of electrical energy. Semiconductors, as the name indicates, may be conduc- tors or nonconductors, depending upon the temperature in intrinsic semiconductors or upon the electrical bias imposed upon the crystals from without in impurity semiconduc- tors. Among the most commonly used semiconductor mate- rials are germanium, silicon, and gallium arsenide. In the pure state these substances are nonconductors, but with the addition of very small amounts of certain impurities they cari become semiconductors."},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"284 Chapter Seventeen The theory behind this behavior may be stated briefly as follows: The binding force that holds atoms together to form molecules and molecules together to form crystals resides in the outer ring of electrons in the atom, and the number of such charges determines the valence of the atom. Normally, when the valence bonds to other atoms are satis- fied, the atom has no loosely held electrons in its outer ring. If, however, an impurity is added that has a different number of electrons in the outer orbit, there Will be either an excess or a deficiency of electrons in the valence bonds of the crystal. When there is an excess the semiconductor is said to be n-type, and when there is a deficiency the semi- conductor is p-type. In the region where the latter condi- tion exists there is said to be a hole. A junction between n-type and p-type semiconductors Will pass a current in only one direction. The impurities are different for various kinds of crystals. Those most commonly used are arsenic and aluminum. TRANSISTORS Bell Telephone Laboratories had been working on the prob- lem of providing a cheaper and better electronic switching device than the vacuum tube for some years with little success. In 1947 two of the researchers at Bell Laboratories, Walter H. Brattain and John Bardeen, succeeded in produc- ing a low-frequency amplifier using a piece of silicon im- mersed in a Salt solution. A month later they substituted a bit of germanium for the silicon and again succeeded in producing amplification. Research continued at an acceler- ated pace until in June 1948 the first transistor was made by inserting three pointed wires into a piece of germanium. Two of these wires were part of an external circuit, and the third, when connected to a battery, provided a bias voltage"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Masers, Fuel Cells, Transistors 285 in much the same manner as is used with the grid of a vacuum tube. The bias voltage must be sufficient to over- corne the counterpressure, or barrier within the crystal. With the required bias voltage a current cari be made to flow through the crystal as through any other conductor. A third member of the Bell Telephone Laboratories team was William 0. Shockley, who had developed the theory underlying transistor behavior. In 1949 he published an article in the Bell System Technical Journal entitled “The Theory of p-n Junctions in Semiconductors and p-n Junc- tion Transistors.” The term junction as it was used in the article and as it is generally understood is the contact area between regions in a crystal having p and n characteristics. Such a junction has the properties of a rectifier. The original transistors were not satisfactory, because it was not possible to make them by inserting wires in a crystal with any degree of uniformity, and they were noisy and mechanically weak. In Shockley’s article he proposed that the transistor could be much improved by using a single crystal into the faces of which the necessary im- purities were introduced. Firm connections could then be made at the required points, eliminating the unreliable wire contacts. The first such transistors were introduced com- mercially in 1951, but production in quantity was still not possible because silicon and germanium contained traces of unwanted impurities that interfered with satisfactory per- formance. These were later found to be gold in silicon and copper in germanium, in such small quantities as to defy chemical analysis. The impurities problem was solved in 1954 when Wil- liam G. Pfann, a metallurgist at Bell Laboratories, discovered a new method of refining silicon and germanium that yielded products of very high purity. T O accomplish this re-"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"286 Chapter Seventeen suit a long piece of the material was heated in a narrow zone by means of a high-frequency field. The molten zone was moved slowly along the length of the bar. It was found that the impurities were swept along ahead of the melted sub- stance, leaving almost perfectly pure material behind. When the entire length of the bar had been covered in this man- ner, the impurities were concentrated at one end and could be removed. With these purified materials transistors of excellent qual- ity were produced in 1955. There were further improve- ments in manufacturing following one upon another, such as producing a junction in a single crystal during growth. Slices tut from such a crystal could be made into transis- tors. A more common method was to form junctions by putting small dots of the required impurity on opposite sides of a thin piece of crystal and baking at a temperature high enough to cause the impurities to penetrate the surface of the semiconductor material. Later in 1955 the diffusion technique was introduced in which a slice of germanium or silicon was heated in an atmosphere containing a vapor of the desired impurity, with the result that a very small amount of the impurity was deposited upon the semicon- ductor and penetrated into it. This method, far superior to any previously employed, was used in the production of uniform commercial transistors. What was even more im- portant, it was possible to manufacture transistors that were capable of operating at frequencies in the hundreds of megacycles. THE TRANSISTOR INDUSTRY Practically a11 of the early development work on transistors was done at Bell Laboratories or at Western Electric Com- pany. In 1949 the Bell Company was under pressure from"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"Masers, Fuel Cells, Transistors 287 the federal government to divorce the Western Electric Company, its subsidiary. Partly because of this pressure and partly for other reasons, Western Electric Company offered to license other manufacturers to produce transistors by paying a flat fee of $25,000. Later the field was thrown wide open without the payment of a fee. This wide-open situation in the transistor industry caused a rapid growth, SO that by 1954 there were twenty-five or more manufacturers in the field in the United States who were carrying on research. Although the Western Electric Company had a big lead at first, some of the competitors soon developed advanced technologies that caused the in- dustry to progress at a tremendous rate. Among those who made significant contributions to transistor science and technology were Texas Instruments, RCA, Philco, Transi- tron, General Electric, Westinghouse, Hughes, Sylvania, and Raytheon. Electrical manufacturers and research laboratories in for- eign countries were soon engaged in transistor work and made contributions of immense value. Dr. Leo Esaki, the Japanese physicist, invented the tunnel diode, in which gal- lium arsenide was used as a semiconductor. European labo- ratories in Holland, Germany, England, and France were also engaged in meaningful research at an early date. As a result of Dr. Esaki’s work the General Electric Com- pany produced a gallium arsenide transistor that was capa- ble of frequencies of 4000 to 5000 megacycles. Experi- ments have been conducted with many other semiconduc- tor materials including bismuth telluride, tungsten carbide, silicon carbide, and even diamond.

Transistors have replaced vacuum tubes to a large extent for such varied uses as radio, television, telephone equipment, and computers. The transistor has led to the development of miniaturization by the use of integrated circuits in which entire circuits including transistors, resis- tors, capacitors, and their connections are etched on tiny chips. A whole new field called microelectronics has been born making possible not only a reduction in size and cost but also increased reliability and an extension of the Upper frequency range."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"18 Atomic Energy, Government Research, Nuclear Fusion ATOMIC ENERGY Scientists had suspected since 1898 that the atom con- tained large amounts of energy that in some cases could be released, and they also surmised that matter and energy were mutually convertible. It was in 1898 that the Lorentz transformations based on the Michelson-Morley experi- ments were announced. The equivalence of matter and energy was further emphasized by Einstein in 1905, at which time he made public his now-famous equation E = mc2 Actual proof of the availability of such energy came with the experiments of Rutherford in 1919 and again in 1932 by Cockroft and Walton, when they succeeded. in splitting the lithium atom. In 1932 also, N. Feather, an- other British scientist, succeeded in splitting the nitrogen atom by bombardment with neutrons. Enrico Fermi, professor of physics at Rome, discovered in 1934 that when uranium atoms were bombarded with neu- trons the uranium became radioactive, and in 1937 he found that the radioactivity was due to the creation of several isotopes of uranium. Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassman of Berlin discovered in 1939 that in the Fermi experiment not only were isotopes produced, but uranium atoms were split to form pairs of other elements having atomic weights about half that of uranium. Accompanying this split there was the release of a large amount of energy. The various isotopes of uranium were found to be fission-"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"290 Chapter Eighteen able in varying degrees. A slow neutron is sufficient to split a U-235 atom, whereas to split a U-238 atom requires a fast neutron. Based on the knowledge that vast amounts of energy were available from the atom, it became evident that under the proper conditions a chain reaction would be pro- duced. In order to test these theories, it was necessary to obtain a quantity of one or more of the readily fissionable isotopes of uranium. The separation of a small quantity of U-235 was first accomplished by A. 0. Nier of the Univer- sity of Minnesota in 1939, using a modified Aston mass spectrograph. Experiments with this material proved be- yond a doubt that such fissionable isotopes could indeed provide energy in undreamed of amounts. Nuclear research using accelerators, or atom smashers, as they were called at the time, began to yield important re- sults in the transmutation of elements and in the produc- tion of isotopes. As early as 1919 Rutherford produced oxygen and hydrogen from helium and nitrogen with the use of natural radiation by alpha particles from a radioac- tive source. In 1932 Cockcroft and Walton, who were re- searchers in the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge under Rutherford, obtained helium from hydrogen and lithium in the first accelerator experiment. Their apparatus was a puny affair compared with the many-million-volt accelera- tors of a few years later. Powerful accelerators were re- quired to reach the nuclei of the heavy elements such as uranium. Within a very short time after the completion of these accelerators, very significant results began to appear. In 1937 Perrier and Segrè discovered the element technetium, which had been produced by the bombardment of molyb- denum with neutrons or deuterons."},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Atomic Energy, Government Research, Nuclear Fusion 291 Francium was discovered by Mlle Marguerite Perey in 1937 as a disintegration product of actinium. Neptunium was first identified by P. H. Abelson and Ed- win M. McMillan in 1939. It was produced by the bombard- ment of U-238 with slow neutrons and was the first of the new transuranium elements. Astatine was found in 1940 as the result of the bombard- ment of bismuth with alpha particles by Corson, MacKen- zie, and Segrè. Plutonium, one of the more important new elements, was discovered in 1940 by Kennedy, McMillan, Seaborg, Segrè, and Wahl. It is formed by the decay of neptunium. Other elements discovered during this period or a little later included americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, and mendelevium. Nearly a11 of these new elements were discovered at Berkeley by re- searchers who in addition to those already mentioned in- cluded Glenn T. Seaborg, Joseph W. Kennedy, Ralph A. James, Leon 0. Morgan, and Albert Ghiorso. NUCLEAR RESEARCH FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT Hahn and Strassman of Germany split the uranium atom in 1939, the year in which World War II began. Scientists who were familiar with the possibilities presented by this dis- covery feared that Germany might put together an atomic bomb which would have terrible consequences for the Al- lied cause. The fears were presented to President Roosevelt in a letter written by Albert Einstein on October 11, 1939, but the problem was already under attack in many laboratories throughout the United States and also in England. At the beginning of the year 1940 the only readily fissionable ma-"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"292 Chapter Eighteen terial was U-235 and the problem was to find methods of concentrating the 0.7 percent of U-235 that occurs natu- rally in uranium. By the end of the year a new fissionable element, plutonium, was discovered. Altogether four possible methods of separating U-235 were under consideration. These were the gaseous diffusion process, begun at Columbia University; the thermal diffu- sion process, invented by P. H. Abelson and under test at the Naval Research Laboratory, near Washington; the cen- trifugal process at the University of Virginia; and the mass spectrograph, electromagnetic, or calutron process at Berke- ley. In order to coordinate these scattered efforts, the National Defense Research Committee was appointed in June 1940, under the leadership of Dr. Vannevar Bush who was suc- ceeded a year later by Dr. James B. Conant. Progress was slow, and it was not until May 1942 that the committee met to decide which method would produce the greatest quantity of U-235 in the shortest time. The committee was unable to make a choice and decided, therefore, to build facilities using three of the available methods: gaseous dif- fusion, centrifuge, and calutron. Before the plant was built, however, the centrifuge method was dropped. The committee’s recommendation was accepted by the War Department and Colonel James C. Marshall of the Man- hattan Engineer District was selected to head the project, which came to be known as the Manhattan Project. Within a short time Brigadier General L. R. Groves succeeded Colo- nel Marshall; his principal assignment was the construction of the facilities needed for the large-scale production of U-235 and later of plutonium. A group of leading nuclear scientists was assembled at the University of Chicago where the new Metallurgical Labora-"},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"Atomic Energy, Government Research, Nuclear Fusion 293 tory had been completed. The primary purpose of this group was to build an atomic pile or self-sustaining reactor. This group was headed by Dr. Arthur H. Compton and in- cluded Enrico Fermi, Glenn Seaborg, Isadore Perlman, Leo Szilard, Eugene Wigner, Herbert Anderson, Walter Zinn, and Samuel Anderson. The Argonne National Laboratory, which was under construction at this time, was to house the proposed reactor, but when construction of Argonne was delayed it was decided to build a smaller one under the stands at Stagg Field. Work on this reactor was begun on November 7, 1942, and it went into service on the after- noon of December 2,1942. The Oak Ridge, Tennessee, plant for the separation of U-235, which included a new town for its workers, was rushed to completion. At first it contained only the gaseous diffusion and calutron separation facilities. The calutron portion was first to go into operation, and although it did produce U-235 it was found to be inefficient. The gaseous diffusion plant went into operation January 20, 1945, and it, too, was rather disappointing at first. After it was found that production fell short of the de- sired quantities, it was decided that if partially enriched uranium could be fed into the production lines the process would be speeded up considerably. The decision was made, therefore, to build a thermal diffusion plant that would yield uranium enriched to at least double the natural amount of U-235. The new plant was ready in late 1944. A plutonium plant, called the Hanford Engineering Works, was built in the State of Washington. It was begun in March 1943 and, in addition to the plant, included housing for thousands of workers. In the production of plutonium on a large scale, as in the laboratory, U-238 is bombarded with slow neutrons to form neptunium that then decays to pro-"},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"294 Chapter Eighteen duce plutonium. In order to carry out this process on a production basis, a very large reactor was built. After only eighteen months spent on construction, Hanford was ready. The reactor went critical a few minutes after midnight on September 27, 1944, but it had operated only a few hours when it gradually failed. Some time passed before the trouble was found, when it was discovered that the reactor was poisoned by xenon 135. Fermi finally determined that the difficulty could be overcome by operating the reactor at a higher rate. Production was resumed on Christmas Day of 1944. LOS ALAMOS LABORATORY AND THE ATOMIC BOMB The Los Alamos (New Mexico) Laboratory was begun in March 1943, at which time scientists from many universi- ties in the United States were brought together under the leadership of J. R. Oppenheimer. The purpose of this group was to construct an atomic bomb. While they knew, in a general way, what was required to put together such a de- vice, no one had any precise information as to what consti- tuted a critical mass of uranium or how the components could be brought together in the exceedingly brief time of a few millionths of a second. These problems were solved, one by one, with the greatest of tare. The first experi- mental bomb was exploded at Alamogordo, New Mexico, at 5:30 A.M., July 16, 1945. On August 6, 1945, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan, and three days later a second bomb obliterated Nagasaki. ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION In July 1946, b t a ou a year after the end of the war, the Congress of the United States established the Atomic En-"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"Atomic Energy, Government Research, Nuclear Fusion 295 ergy Commission, which since that time has had the respon- sibility of providing radioactive materials, not only for mili- tary purposes, but more importantly for peacetime uses. In twenty years atomic energy became competitive with coal and other fossil fuels, and there has been a tremendous expansion in medical uses of radioactive materials, opening an entirely new field in medical practice. The use of radio- active materials as tracers has found wide applications, not only in medicine, but also in plant genetics and even in industry. NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS Nuclear power plants are electric generating stations that use radioactive materials for fuel. They produce heat by atomic fission and generate steam for the operation of tur- boelectric generators. Eight basic types of reactors for use in these plants have been operated or tested experimentally. These are pressurized water, boiling water, sodium graphite, fast breeder, homogenous, organic cooled and moderated, gas cooled, and high temperature gas cooled. Reactor assemblies, in addition to the fuel tore, contain a coolant such as water, gas, liquid metals, or other materials to carry the heat from the atomic pile to a heat exchanger. In the case of a boiling wat& reactor, however, steam is generated directly in the reactor tank. Reactor assemblies also include a moderator, which is most commonly water or graphite, and finally there must be provision for control, which is usually accomplished by means of control rods. The moderator is designed to change the fast neutrons, with velocities averaging 10,000 miles per second, to slow (or thermal) neutrons, having velocities of about 1 mile per second. The slow neutrons are much more effective in split- ting U-235 atoms than the fast neutrons. Control rods are necessary to hold the rate of fission at"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"296 Chapter Eighteen the level required for power demands or to shut down the reactor. There are other methods of controlling the produc- tion of heat but control rods are the most commonly used. They may be composed of boron steel, boron carbide, gadolinium, samarium, or other materials. In the United States the fuel used in nuclear reactors is most often enriched uranium containing from 1.5 to 5 per- cent U-235. In B&ain natural uranium metal is used in most cases because the facilities for the production of U-235 are not sufficient for the purpose. When a U-235 atom is split, about 2.5 neutrons are re- leased on the average, but some of these are lost. At least one of the neutrons must be available for splitting another atom if the chain reaction is to be maintained. Most of the nuclear power generating stations in the United States are of the pressurized-water or boiling water type. In England, which at present has most of the world’s nuclear generating capacity, gas-cooled reactors have been used exclusively. The gas employed has been mostly carbon dioxide, but with higher temperatures in the newer plants it has become necessary to change to helium. The first large-scale nuclear power plant in the world was Calder Hall in England, which began operating in October 1956. In the United States the first nuclear power plant designed solely for power generation was the Shippingport station in Pennsylvania, which began the production of electricity on December 2, 1957. Calder Hall was a gas- cooled plant using carbon dioxide and Shippingport was a pressurized-water plant. At the end of 1966, England had 4,048,OOO kilowatts of nuclear generating capacity in operation, and the United States had 1,956,OOO kilowatts. At that time, new capacity under construction or planned was 5,290,OOO kilowatts in"},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"Atomic Energy, Government Research, Nuclear Fusion 297 England and 9,285,OOO kilowatts in the United States. At the end of the year 1969, the United States had 5,235,OOO kilowatts of nuclear capacity in operation and had 65,365,OOO kilowatts under construction or planned, with the latest completion date set at 1977 but with most of the capacity to be ready by 1974. NUCLEAR FUSION Although the energy liberated in nuclear fission is very great, the energy available from nuclear fusion is even greater but much more difficult to achieve. Fission occurs in the heavier elements, whereas fusion is possible only in the lighter elements, notably hydrogen and tritium (the triple mass isotope of hydrogen). Helium apparently cannot be used in the fusion process, but it is an end product of fusion. It is possible that lithium may be suitable for this purpose. The great difficulty in achieving fusion is that it requires temperatures in the millions of degrees and very high pressures. Such conditions prevail in the interior of our sun and in the stars, but SO far a controlled fusion process has been impossible. Hydrogen bombs have been exploded with the use of an atomic bomb to trigger the reaction. Much work has been done in seeking a method of using the fusion process for the production of useful energy, but it is evident that no substance on earth could contain a fusion reaction at the required temperatures and pressures. S O far the most promising method is one in which the required conditions are obtained by confining the process within a powerful magnetic field (pin& effect), but the solution seems a long way off. WHITHER When Joseph Priestley, back in the eighteenth Century, wrote his book, The History and Present State of Electric-"},{"pageNumber":316,"pageContent":"298 Chapter Eighteen ity, he predicted that new developments in electrical sci- ence would far outstrip anything yet conceived, but some of his contemporaries were sure that nothing more could be learned about the subject. Considering the advanced state of electrical science today, we might be forgiven if we be- lieved that man had reached the limit of his capabilities in this direction, but we must recognize that each new step has uncovered more questions than it has provided answers. Therefore, if the past is in any way a guide to the future, we may be sure that still greater achievements lie ahead. As we view the accomplishments of the last half Century we are amazed at the ability of men of science to learn of things which the “eye hath not seen nor ear heard.” At the same time every truly great scientist must view with awe, wonder, and admiration the great works of creation, whose mysteries he has explored."},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"BIBLIOGRAPHY 1 Davis, Sir J.
