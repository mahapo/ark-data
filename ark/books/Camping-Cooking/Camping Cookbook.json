Juicy grilled hotdogs and gooey toasted marshmallows,right? But you may also be wondering if that’s all there is, becauseafter several days in the wilderness, you’ll probably be cravingsomething a little more nutritious, diverse, and flavorful. The goodnews is that your culinary options at the campsite aren’t as limited asmany people assume. There are many different outdoor cookingoptions to explore, and the Dutch oven (or cast iron cooking, as it’salso called) is one of the best. Dutch ovens have been around for hundreds of years. In fact, theywere the primary means of cooking for European settlers of NorthAmerica. Their sturdiness and durability made them ideal for cookingout in the elements, but the true beauty of cast iron/Dutch ovencooking is the even heat distribution, which makes preparing eventhe most finicky of dishes a breeze. With your Dutch oven you will beable to create an incredible range of breakfasts, savory meals, sweettreats, and snacks. Within the pages of this book you will findeverything that you need to expertly craft an array of campfire Dutchoven dishes. This book is the volume 2 of the Dutch Oven Camping Cookbook inthe series Camping cookbooks with even more recipes made forDutch oven camping cooking. The introduction is the same as in thefirst book where we go over the basics of cooking with a cast ironDutch oven at the campsite. If you would like to go directly to therecipes, just click here. Please note that all recipes can also be made at home by replacingthe campfire by the oven or the stovetop. Let’s get started!"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Choosing Your Cast Iron Dutch Oven There are many types of Dutch ovens available, and the choicesmay seem overwhelming at first. No matter what brands and pricepoints you’re looking at, though, there are some basic features youshould always consider before choosing your Dutch oven. The first is size. For camping purposes, a good size is 12–16 inches.Smaller ones don’t have enough space to cook meals for multiplepeople. However, if you are a solo or couples-only camper, you maybe able to get away with a smaller model. A 12-inch Dutch ovenprovides enough room to prepare medium-sized meals, fits in nicelyat most campsite heat sources, and is not so large and heavy thatit’s overly cumbersome to transport. The next feature is the type of lid. Most Dutch ovens are intended forhome use and therefore don’t have the kind of lid you need forcooking at your campsite. Choose a Dutch oven with a lid that is tightfitting, concave, and has at least a small rim around the edge. Thiswill provide a secure surface for placing hot coals on top of youroven. Also make sure that the lid has a solid handle that is largeenough to be lifted with a lid lifter device. Finally, choose a Dutch oven with good legs. It should have threeevenly spaced legs that raise it at least an inch off of the ground.Good legs provide a stable cooking surface and allow plenty of roomfor hot coals to be placed underneath."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Cast Iron How-To Cooking with cast iron requires a few extra steps for maintenance,but there’s no doubt that the results are worth it! Here are a fewpieces of advice concerning care, upkeep, and use of your cast ironDutch oven. Seasoning your cast iron cookware The first thing you need to know about cast iron care is seasoning.Seasoning is the process of applying oil to your cast iron, initially toremove contaminants, and then to prevent rust, corrosion, andbaked-on food particles from degrading your cookware. The onlytime you ever need to use dish detergent on your cast iron is the firsttime you season it. To do that, scrub the inside and the outside of theoven with a hot, soapy mixture. Dry it thoroughly with a cloth, andthen place it on a very hot heat source to finish drying the surface.Once it is completely dry, rub oil or fat (not butter) into the surface,both inside and out. Once the oven has been coated, take anothercloth and continue to rub and polish the oven until it appears thatthere is no oily residue left. Place the oven back on the heat sourcefor about an hour, flipping it over halfway through. Remove from theheat and let cool before handling. Depending on the oven, you maywant to repeat this process several times before using it for the firsttime; repeated seasonings help to condition the cast iron and providean attractive surface sheen. Season the oven again periodicallythroughout its life as you see fit. Cleaning Cleaning cast iron is a little different from cleaning other cookware.After using your Dutch oven, remove as much food from it as youcan. While it’s still warm, add about an inch or more of water and letit sit with the lid on. After 15–20 minutes, remove the lid and scrapeoff any remaining food bits. Discard the dirty water and repeat the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"process with clean water until the oven is free of food residue. Drythe inside thoroughly with a cloth and place the oven back on thewarm coals to help drive off the remaining moisture. Once the ovenis dry and cool, apply a very light layer of vegetable oil to the surfaceinside and out. Cooking with a Cast Iron Dutch Oven at the Campsite When using a cast iron Dutch oven at your campsite, you will usuallybe applying heat to both the top and the bottom by means ofcharcoal briquettes. The recipes in this book assume a temperatureof approximately 350°F. In order to achieve this, you will usebriquettes in numbers that are proportional to the size of your oven.A general rule is to use twice as many briquettes as the diameter ofyour oven. For example, if you have a 12-inch oven, you will use 24pieces of charcoal. A 16-inch oven would require approximately 32.This, however, is a very generalized rule that should only serve as aguideline. Always use a thermometer when you are learning togauge the temperature of your oven, especially if you are usingwood rather than coals. Where you place the coals, and in what numbers, also depends onthe method of cooking. Different quantities and configurations canhelp distribute the heat properly or concentrate it to a critical area.For sautéing, boiling, frying, or open lid cooking, you will place all ofthe coals underneath the oven. For methods of cooking that requireboth a top and bottom heat source, distribute the coals between thebottom and the top of the lid. Depending on the proportion of heatthat you need from each heat source, you can divide them up withhalf on top and half on the bottom, or ¾ on the bottom and ¼ on top.Give yourself a little time to practice adjusting the heat on your Dutchoven before creating more involved meals. Cooking with your Dutch oven outside is a little different from using itindoors, and it requires a few pieces of additional equipment. First ofall, you definitely want a good, reliable lid lifting device. Cast iron can"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"get very hot, especially if you have hot coals placed on the lid. Toprotect yourself from burns, use a heat protective glove or mitt alongwith a lid lifting device to remove the lid. A lid stand is also a goodidea. This will provide a heat-proof resting place for your lid so youwon’t have to set it down on the dirty ground. You may also find along pair of tongs helpful for moving hot coal briquettes. If you spenda great deal of time cooking in the great outdoors, at some point youmay wish to invest in either a tripod or a Dutch oven cooking table.These devices are a little more cumbersome than the Dutch ovenalone, but they provide a more stable, safer cooking environment."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"Prep Early to Make Camping More Fun One of the charms of Dutch oven cooking is the way it streamlinesmeal preparation while camping. Most dishes are “one pot” dishesthat require little more than the assembly of ingredients and theproper adjustment of heat. After that, you just leave it alone and letthe cast iron work its magic. You can make cooking at the campsite even easier by doing some ofthe food prep at home. Plastic food storage bags with secureclosures are great for carrying premade ingredients. They come inwashable and disposable varieties, they can easily be labeled, andthey are the most compact way of storing food in small spaces. With some dishes, you can prepare all of the ingredients andcombine them together in one bag so that all you need to do is dumpthem in the Dutch oven. If you’ll be preparing a number of differentdishes with the same ingredients, you can prepare larger quantitiesof those ingredients and store them in separate plastic bags,retrieving only what you need for each meal. You can also prepare aset of ingredients for each dish separately, bag and label them, andthen assemble them at the campsite. Camping doesn’t mean that you have to give up homemade flavor infavor of convenience foods. However, certain premade, canned, andfrozen foods will save you time, and they can be easily enhancedwith just a few small additions. For example, a jarred sauce with afew added spices will taste heavenly and save you the trouble of making it from scratch. Always pack a little extra. You never know when you will wantseconds or meet a new mouth to feed. Welcome others into yourcampsite and make new friends and memories around your cast ironDutch oven."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Food Safety and Other Things to Consider When cooking outdoors, it is especially important to be diligent aboutfood safety. Whether you have a portable refrigerator in your camperor you’re depending upon your trusty cooler and ice or ice packs,keeping perishable foods at a temperature of 40°F or lower is prioritynumber one. It takes barely any time at all for food-borne bacteria toinvade your perishables. It is a good idea to bring along a couple offood thermometers to monitor the temperature of foods both duringrefrigeration and during cooking. Also, never leave cooked foodsitting out too long. Once you are finished eating, any leftoversshould be properly packaged and refrigerated. Double-bag any raw meat or prepared meals that contain raw meat.Do not store any ingredients that may be eaten raw in the samecontainer as uncooked meats. Leakage of meat juices maycontaminate produce and other food items, turning a fun campingtrip into a very unpleasant one. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of meatbefore eating it. All poultry and ground meat mixtures should becooked to an internal temperature of 165°F. Beef has a slightly widerrange of acceptable temperatures based on how well done you likeit; it should be cooked to at least 145°F (safe rare to medium-raretemperature) up to 170°F (well done all of the way through).Theseguidelines also need to be followed for any ingredients that havebeen in contact with raw meat within the packets. Keep in mind that the recipes in this book have been created to becooked at a temperature of approximately 350°F, unless otherwisestated. The actual temperature of your Dutch oven may sometimesbe higher or lower, and your cooking times should be adjustedaccordingly. Always check the temperature of your meats beforeconsuming, and never rely solely on cook times for doneness."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Dutch ovens can become very hot.
