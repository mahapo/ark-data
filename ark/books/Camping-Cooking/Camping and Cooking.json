For one, we get to totally unplug from everything, which is an excellent way of dealing with everyday stress. It is also a very good way to experie nce things we can’t just do at home or in urban areas like campfires and peeing anywhere we want to. And for older people like me, camping is a perfectly good excuse to hit the sack by 9 PM latest! Others find that food cooked in the great outdoors seem to taste much better than the standard urban fare. To that extent, camping and cooking have become a great tandem like Batman and Robin, the Wonder Twins, Yogi and Booboo, and Boo and Buddy. It has become a marriage of equals. Each person will find his or her own specific reasons for going camping. What is yours? What, you don’t have a reason yet? You haven’t even tried camping yet? Well, don’t worry. That’s why I wrote this book and that’s why you are reading it: To experience first hand the joy and beauty of camping and cooking.

Y ou don’t all of a sudden do a grand jete and pirouette. Y ou start with first position, second, third.” – Rita Rudner Camping is a great outdoor activity usually done outside of urban areas that lasts from overnight to a few days. Some of the more popular reasons why people love camping according to Reader ’s Digest are the chance to escape the hectic city life, the opportunity to develop a newfound appreciation for Mother Nature, chance to spend quality time with the family , have fun cooking outdoors, a chance to teach and learn new skills, have a pet-friendly vacation and af fordability . Camping comes in dif ferent forms from basic to specialized types such as adventure camping, glamping (glamorous camping), historical camping, minimalist camping, survivalist camping and winter camping. Adventure camping is one where campers who engage in adventurous activities during the day , like adventure racing or mountain biking, and camp minimally at night using just the very basic camping equipment. Glamping is the high-end type of camping that combines camping with home or hotel-like luxuries – it is camping in style and comfort. Historical is a history- themed type of camping where the campsite is set up to resemble a particular historical event’ s settings like the Wild W est, Medieval T imes or the Civil W ar. Minimalist camping requires as little equipment or gear as possible and is often done in places where it is practical to bring less gear . Survivalist camping is one where campers learn basic outdoor survival skills and is often akin to minimalist camping in the sense that campers bring only the basic necessities. Winter camping is, as the name implies, camping outside during the winter . T he best way for us to experience camping is by being prepared and successful preparation requires that we know the important basics of camping. The essentials of campi ng include the campsite, the tent, the sleeping bag, and other equipment.

On the other end are campsites with various facilities and amenities that cater to less-experienced campers’ needs and preferences like fire rings, barbeque grills and shared bathrooms.

No matter how good our equipment is, it can never make up for a safe and enjoyable place of stay. We should consider our level of camping experience, safety, comfort, view and solitude in choosing a campsite. Different campsites have dif ferent features. Ideally, we should choose a campsite that is at least 200 feet or 61 meters from both a water source and the trail. Being that far from a water source minimizes the risk of us campers contaminating it with our waste. The same distanc e between campsite and the trail gives us campers and people using the trail greater solitude. We should also consider weather conditions in choosing a campsite. If it’s hot, we should consider a campsite in a shaded forest to minimize intense sun exposure. If it’s windy, it’s best to set up camp behind a boulder or bush that can act as windbreakers. We must check if our potential campsite has what are called widowmakers such as dead trees and broken limbs that pose risks of falling on our tents while we’re asleep at night and injuring us. Ideally, our campsite should be clear of or is far from widowmakers. Another thing to consider is the site’s elevation. It’s best to set up camp on a site that’s located at an elevated area. Camping at a low spot exposes us to risk of getting caught in flash floods as these tend to act as catch basins. Elevated camping spots also tend to be warmer at night compared to lower lying ones because cool air tends to descend. We should also avoid camping at very high places to minimize the risk of exposure to lightning storms. Only Frankenstein would benefit from camping at the highest point of a campsite. If we’re very particular with comfortable facilities, it’s best to set up camp in commercial camps ites as these offer facilities familiar to us like common bathrooms as well as other camping facilities that make our experience easier such as existing fire rings for creating campfires. For those who want to challenge themselves, natural or non-commercialized sites are the way to go. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3: EQUIPMENT - TENT The tent is our home away from home while camping. That being said, we should take great care in choosing which tent to use for our camping advent ures. Not all tents are created equal and there’ s no such thing as a one-kind-works-for-all tent. How do we go about this business of choosing the right tent for us? We should consider our budget and our campin g preferences to be able to choose the best tent for our buck. In this regard, we should look at a tent’s features to determ ine if it is the right one for us. "},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"SIZE The primary consideration for size is if it will fit in our vehicle. If it doesn’t, then how can we bring it to the campsite and use it? Next to consider is how many people will be able to fit in it. A tent’s capacity is expressed in square footage and the number of sleeping bags that will fit inside. A 4-person tent, therefore, will be able to fit 4 people, though there’s little room for anything else like our gear. David Sweet of camping.about.com suggests using a tent whose capacity is at least 2 people higher than the actual number who will use it so that there is room to spread ourselves out as well as to store our gear in. For some privacy , we can consider using multi-room tents . These are available in 2- room models, each separated within by a tent wall with a zippered door, or even in 3- room variants that offer an extra room for either changing clothes or for putting tables and chairs in case of rainy weather . "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"TENT POLES Tent poles are our tents’ skeletons and are made of different types of materials such as carbon fiber, aluminum, fiberglass, steel, wood and plastic. Although it’s often used for fishing rods, carbon fiber is increasing in popularity as a material for tent poles. Its main advantage is weight: it’s very light. Carbon fiber tent poles are the tent poles of choice for campers going on long trips or camps and who will be setting up their tents more often than the regular camping Joe. And as expected, the lightweight durability comes with a higher price tag. Aluminum and aluminum alloys are the most popular variety of t ent poles today because of its Trinitarian combination of strength, lightweight and durability . Part of its durability is its resistance to cold temperatures. Some of the higher quality aluminum poles are even made from aircraft-gr ade aluminum. But as all superheroes have their own kryptonites, corrosion is the aluminum pole’s chief nemesis. To neutralize this, however , many such poles have a thin protective coating. Fiberglass used to be the poster boy for tent poles, but has been replaced by aluminum and its alloys. That doesn’t mean, however , that tent poles made from it are already passé. Such poles are still very much around, usually at bargain prices because aside from being cheaper to make than most types of poles, it is not as sturdy as aluminum ones. There are concerns that fiberglass poles are prone to breaking if bent too much. Wood poles are lighter than steel poles but not as strong. Wood poles are also heavier than aluminum and carbon fiber ones and are not bendable. Last but not the least, we have the plastic tent poles. These are the lightest and cheapest of all types of poles but isn’t as durable nor as flexible. These tend to break when bent too much and can become brittle when expose d to extreme temperatures. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"RAINFLY The rainfly is the outer wall or layer of our tent, which serves as our tent’s umbrella. The bigger our rainfly is, the more coverage our tent has, the better. Rainflies are waterproof and the best ones for any season are those that go all the way to the ground, circling the entire perimeter of our tent. Some tents feature rainflies and inner walls that are already hooked together , allowing for simultaneous pitching to the ground. This feature is a great time saver, cutting down pitching time in half and preventing rain from seeping into the inner tent. One thing to consider in choosing our tent is a rainfly that goes down well on the tent’ s sides rather than just across its top. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"SEAMS AND STITCHING A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. In the same manner , a tent’s ability to keep water from leaking inside is as good as how its seams are stitched together . If we pull on on both ends of a seam and we see through the stitches, chances are high that it will leak when it rains. This is bad unless we want a built-in shower room for our tents. Double stitching reinforces the connection of each seam and reduces the risk of leaks during rain. When choosing tents, it’s best to go with those that have seams with double-stitches, which aren’t visible even when the seams are pulled apart. "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"FLOORING Most tents’ floors are what are called tub floors, where the waterproof material of the floor extends up to 6-8 inches up the sides of each wall. This type of design prevents water from seeping through the sides of the floor. Seamless or one-piece tub floors are best for tents because no seams mean there's no space for water to leak in. To protect our tent’s tub floor, we should use good tent pads or ground cloths beneath it to protect against constant grinding against surfaces and extend our tent floor ’s life. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"GUY LINES A guy line is not some cheesy pick-up line. It refers to a rope used to keep a tent secure enough not to be blown away by the wind and tightens a tent’s walls to prevent it from flapping in the wind. A guy line is usually tied to rings located outside of a tent’s walls (guy points) and is anchored to the ground by a tent stake. We should choose tents with adequate guy lines and guy points. Many campers feel 3 meters worth of guy line is adequate for most tents. A useful rule of thumb to determine the ideal guy line length that some campers use to allow for differences in tent sizes is to measure the length from the top of the tent to the stake plus the length of a shoelace. For guy points, many campers feel 6 is adequate enough to secure the tent. "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"ROOF VENT A tent with a roof vent allows for good air circulation inside, eliminating air condensation. Breathing quality air inside our tents can go a long way in helping us sleep well during the night, making our camping experience more enjoyable. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"ZIPPERS Lastly , we want to get a tent with high quality and durable zippers that can stand the wear and tear of frequent use."},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 : EQUIPMENT – SLEEPING BAG A big part of our camping experience is influenced by the quality of our sleep . To this extent, choosing the right sleeping bag will go a long way towards a great camping experience. Sleeping bags are classified as either synthetic fill or down. The difference between the two is their ability to maintain warmth and loft when wet. Synthetic fills are able to maintain loft and warmth even under wet conditions while down ones become soggy and cold when wet. It is also very difficult to dry. Our best bet for a great camping sleep is a syntheti c fill sleeping bag, if our budget allows for it. With it, we don’t have to worry about camping under any weather condition. In choosing our sleeping bag, we need to check out certain features that will help us choose wisely . "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"TEMPERATURE RATING This refers to a sleeping bag’s threshold in terms of keeping the average sleeper warm. For example, a sleeping bag with a temperature rating of 15 degrees means that on average, a person sleeping inside the bag should feel warm and comfortable when the air temperature is no lower than 15 degrees. The higher the rating, the warmer a sleeping bag feels. For rating purposes, it is assumed that the person sleeping in the bag is using a sleeping pad under the bag and is wearing a layer of long underwear. A bag’s temperature rating should only be considered a guide and not a guarantee because other factors can also influence our overall warmth. These include the use of a sleeping pad (insulation between the sleeping bag and the cold ground), the tent itself (the dead air inside it results in additional 10 degrees Fahrenheit of warmth), our metabolism, gender , clothing and hydration (hydration adds warmth). A good guide when it comes to temperature ratings is to buy a sleeping bag with a rating that’s lower than the lowest temperature we expect to experience while camping. If we expect the lowest temperature to be 20 degrees Fahrenh eit, it’s better we choose a bag with a rating of less than that. Better to feel warmer than colder . Sleeping bags are normally categorized into summer season bags, 3-season bags, cold weather bags and winter/ex treme bags. Summer season bags have a temperature rating of +35 degrees Fahrenheit and higher, 3-season bags with ratings from +10 degrees to +35 degrees Fahrenheit, cold weather bags with ratings from -10 to +10 degrees Fahrenheit and winter/extreme bags with ratings ranging from -10 degrees Fahrenheit and lower . "},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"INSULATION Sleeping bags can be classified into 2 types according to insulation: synthetic and goose-down. Most campers prefer synthetic insulated sleeping bags because compared to goose-down insulated sleeping bags, synthetic ones are quicker drying, can insulate even when wet, less expensive and hypo-allergenic. Sleeping bags with goose-down insulation is a more durable alternative but is usually more expensive than synthetic ones and can’t insulate well when wet. An alternative insulating option known as water-resistant down combines goose-down with moisture protection for insulating feathers. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"SHAPE AND FIT Most sleeping bags are rectangular-shaped for optimal comfort and roominess. Semi- rectangular bags have a tapered shape design that offers more warmth than rectangular bags while still offering enough room for a good night’s sleep. Women’s sleeping bags are shaped to match a woman’ s body contour and are shorter , have wider hips, narrower shoulders more upper-body and foot box insulation. Rectangular sleeping bags are our bag of choice for more room over warmth while semi- rectangular ones get our nod for more warmth than roominess. For women who prefer a snugger fit and more insulation at the top and foot, a sleeping bag that’s tailor fit for women in general is the way to go. "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"ZIPPER COMPATIBILITY Some sle eping bags can be connected to other sleeping bags through compatible zippers and create bigger ones. Thi s is a good alternative to buying one big sleeping bag as it of fers flexibility in fitting the number of sleepers as needed. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"HOODS It is a kno wn fact that in cold temper atures, a significant amount of body heat escapes through our head. A semi-rectangular sleeping bag with a built-in hood that can be clinched with a draw cord can help prevent heat from escaping through our head. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"POCKETS Keeping valuables safe while camping can be a challenge. The best way to protect them is to put the m in our sleeping bags. Doing so, however , runs the risk of us damaging them as we toss and turn while sleeping. Bags with stash pockets inside can help us keep our valuables in place while inside our sleeping bags as we toss and turn during the night."},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5 : EQUIPMENT - OTHERS Apart from a tent and a sleeping bag, we need other equipment to make our camping experience a pleasantly memorable one. These include a first aid kit, clothes, personal hygiene items and cleaning items. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"FIRST AID KIT Accidents may or may not happen while we are camping. Either way , it’ s better to err on the side of caution and bring something that will enable us to properly handle possible camping-related injuries. However , it would be impossible to prepare for all possible mishaps that can happen while camping. T o do that would require us to bring along a whole hospital’ s worth of medical equipment and supplies! The best we can do is to bring a first aid kit to help us properly treat common camping related injuries. A good first aid kit should include personal medication, bandages, aspirin, medical tape, sterile gauzes, elastic wraps, antibiotic wipes, antiseptic cream, burn ointment, sunburn lotion, hydrogen peroxide, scissors, tweezers, eye wash, sanitary napkins and a snake bite kit. "},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"CLOTHING Dress codes are not just for formal events and corporate activities – they’re also for camping. Bringing or wearing appropriate clothing is an important ingredient for an enjoyable camping experience. Appropriate clothing includes t-shirts, shorts, jeans/pants, socks, shoes/boots, camp shoes, hat/cap, sweater , rain poncho, underwear , swim suit and laundry bag. This list assumes fair weather camping. "},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"PERSONAL HYGIENE KIT Cleanliness is next to godliness, as the saying goes. While being clean may not necessarily be as related to religion, it can contribute greatly to a heavenly camping experience. A good personal hygiene kit includes a toothbrush, toothpaste, washrags, towels, soap, deodorant/body spray , comb/brush, nail clippers, razor and toilet paper . "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"CLEANING ITEMS Being outdoors is doesn’t justify not cleaning up after our own mess. As a courtesy not just to other campers but also to the environment, we should clean up the site after using it. Cleaning items like brooms, dustpans, rakes, dishpans, detergents, dishrags and pot scrubbers are excellent items to consider in keeping campsites clean."},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6: SETTING UP CAMP After the long and arduous process of choosing our equipment, packing them and driving to the site, we have finally arrived. After taking a moment to rest our travel- weary bodies, it’ s time to get to work. First thing on our age nda is to check out the site and clear it of unwanted debris. After that, we can now pitch our tents. As mentioned earlier , we should first lay down the tent pad or ground cloth before pitching the tent to protect the tent’ s floor from being scratched and damaged by the ground when we move inside the tent. When pitching the tent, let us make sure to set up the rainfly just in case it rains. W e must also ensure that the guy lines are tight and snug to prevent parts of the tent not only from flapping but to ensure our tent won’t get blown away . After clearing the area and successfully setting up our tent, next thing we need to do is to secure food supplies against both wildlife (think Y ogi and Booboo) and spoilage. Wild animals, particularly bears, are both intelligent and have a very keen sense of smell. They are reported to be able to smell food from miles away and some of them, like the grizzly bear , are agile enough to climb trees so hanging them up high won’t do any good. For this reason, parks where bears are active require campers to store food in plastic, bear resistant containers or sealed in a locker . And if we plan to go fishing, it’ s best we clean the fish far away from the campsite because fish waste can attract bears or other wild animals. W e don’t want to wake up with wild animals breathing down our faces first thing in the morning, do we? The next item on our setting up camp agenda is to set up a fire and cooking area. Due to increased risk of forest fires, not all campsites allow open fires and even those who do implement risk-mitigating measures. It’ s best to check out our campsite’ s fire rules with local authorities even before going there so we can plan accordingly . Many campsites allow the use of portable gas stoves, as these pose significantly less risk of starting forest fires than open fires because the flame can be controlled. For campsites that allow for open fire, it is wise to use existing fire rings instead of creating new ones. If there is no existing fire ring, the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) recommends creating a 1-foot (0.30-meter) deep pit that’ s at least 15 feet (4.57 meters) away from trees, shrubs or tents. Prior to starting a fire, we should clear an area 10 feet (3.04 meters) in diameter around the fire ring and make sure the ground is damp if the fire ring is not on raw earth, sand or gravel. Once the fire is started, we must be cognizant of the weather to minimize the chances of strong and sudden gusts of wind spreading the fire beyond the ring. Before calling it quits, we should make sure to put out the fire completely to prevent accidental fires."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 : COOKING Our camping experience wouldn’t be as complete or as satisfying without great food and nothing beats good old fashioned outdoor cooking at the campsite. "},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"THE CHUCK BOX This is a cooking kit that contains common kitchen items that are useful in preparing great camp food. This includes a box of matches, some lighter fluid, salt, pepper , herbs and spices, cooking oil, pot holders, paper towels, napkins, plastic trash bags, tongs, spatulas, aluminum foils, measuring cups, plastic silverware, paper plates, bowls, a skillet, plastic cups, zip lock bags, knives, a cutting board and cork screw . "},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"COOKING TECHNIQUES The simplest way of cooking food is using direct heat from the campfire, which can be done in 2 ways. One is to put a grate over the open fire, using it as a grill to cook our food. The other is to wrap food items individually using aluminum foils and place them on hot coals or directly over the fire, which cooks food that require high heat very well. To cook soups, pasta and stews , we can use the pots and pans that we brought with us to camp. W e simply let the campfire die down to hot coals and place over them the pots and pans containing containing food items we want to cook. The key to successfully using this technique is ef fective management of the amount and concentration of hot coals because heat can quickly become volatile and this may take time and a bit of trial and error to get down to pat. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"OTHER USEFUL TIPS Measuring and preparing ingredients in advance and packing them in handy containers like ziplock bags, with appropriate labels, can help make cooking in campfires easier , faster and more enjoyable. Same can be said for preparing certain dishes like soups and stews ahead of time by cooking, freezing and packing them for reheating come eating time at the camp. When it comes to campfire cooking, the simpler and quicker it is, the better . Covering pots and pans while cooking outdoors, especially using campfires, helps cook food faster . This is because covering them minimizes the amount of heat esc aping said containers during cooking. It also keeps unnecessary ingredients like insects and dirt from our food."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"C HAPTER 8: CAMPING MEALS As with all food, camping meals have to be delicious to make the experience enjoyable!

"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"WATER ACTIVITIES If we’re fortunate enough to set up camp near a body of water such as a lake, river or the sea, we can do fun things like swimming, floating, kayaking, skipping stones, fishing, water volleyball, diving and snorkeling, among others. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"SPORTS Sports are a great and dry way of having tons of fun while camping. The beautiful thing about sports is that we can adjust our level of play to our respective fitness levels to avoid severe exhaustion while experiencing enough challenging fun to make our camping experience truly enjoyable. Samples of such sports activities are disc golf, horseshoes, blongo ball, ring toss, soccer , American football, baseball, kickball, lawn bowling and corn hole. Disc golf, as defined by the Professional Disc Golf Association or PDGA, is a game played much like traditional golf but instead of traditional balls and clubs, it uses a flying disc. Similar to traditional golf, the objective of the game is to complete each hole (or in this case, targets) in the fewest strokes or throws. Blongo ball, which also goes by the name ladder golf among others, is a multi- generational game that is played in open spaces that are as far from windows as possible, making it a great camping activity . The easiest option would be to buy a ready made set and just play away . To play the game, 2 small ladders 3 rungs high are placed 10 to 50 feet apart from each other . The object of the game is to get the balls, also called bolas, to wrap around the rungs of the ladder at the opposite, with the highest worth only 1 point, the middle rung worth 3 points and the lowest rung worth 5 points. The player who scores the most points wins. Cornho le also known as bean bag toss, is a game whose objective is to score as much points as possible by throwing bags of corn at a raised platform with a hole (the cornhole) at the end. Bags in the hole are worth 3 points while bags that just end up on the platform are worth a point. The player who scores the most points wins.

In this case, games are the perfect alternative. Among the great card games that can be played while camping are poker, blackjack, Uno, Fluxx, Rook, Five Crowns, Apples T o Apples, Phase 10 and Old Maid. Entertaining paper and pencil games include Hangman, T ic-Tac-Toe, Dots and Battleship.

As the saying goes, it’ s better to err on the side of caution so in terms of camping, it’ s better to arrive way too early at the campsite than at or near sunset. "},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"NO PRIOR PRACTICE One of the biggest mistakes camping neophytes make is to not practice pitching their newly acquired or borrowed tents prior to leaving for camp. This coupled with the arriving too late is a deadly combo that can suck the joy out of our camping experience. The obvious way for us to avoid committing this mistake is to practice with our tents before leaving for camp. "},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"CRAMPED IN TRANSLATION Occupancy number ratings are more of guides, not absolutes. Many neophyte campers fail to take into consideration that the standards used by manufacturers to measure the number of occupants that can fit in their tents may be dif ferent from theirs. In some cases, the campers’ idea of capacity is larger than what the manufacturers had in mind. The result: campers cramping inside the tent. T o avoid this mistake, we should choose a tent that is rated at least 2 people more than our expected capacity . If we are expecting 3 people, we should use a tent with a number rating of 5 people. "},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"CAMPFIRE SAVIOR Many neophytes who assume that campfires will provide for all their cooking-heat needs end up hungry because their savior , the campfire, let them down with erratic, and often short-lived flame.

Is the color of vegetable juice pleasing to the eye? I would say yes and no. Huh, it doesn’t make sense? Let me explain my answer . Some vegetables are green and some are red or yellow . Do both types of vegetables make similar juices? Of course no; green vegetables will produce dark or light green juice while red or yellow vegetables will produce red, yellow or orange colored juice. The latter is thus appealing to the eye and to the taste buds than the former . The trick to making a mouth-watering yet nutritious vegetable juice is the choice of ingredients. What do you mix with what? Here are tips of making a sweet vegetable juice. To your green vegetables, add in some fruit or carrot to sweeten it. Do not peel the carrots; peelings contain a lot of nutrients that should not be thrown away. In to your juicer, add in other vegetables such as celery and cucum bers. Want a sweeter juice? Add in an apple. An apple or a pear will improve your juice’s flavor and increase the mineral and vitamin content of your juice. "},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"CHOOSE FRESH AND ORGANIC PRODUCE Whenever you are preparing to make a vegetable juice, shop for fresh, organic fruits and vegetables. The fresher a vegetable or a fruit is, the more nutritious and tastier it is. Choos ing organic produce is choosing health! Organic produce do not have the slightest trace of a chemical in them. They do not have unbalanced nutrients that may interfere with the hormones and genes in your body. Alternatively , you could use a juicer that is able to separate chemicals such as pesticides from your juice. "},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"DO NOT PEEL YOUR INGREDIENTS Scientific research has shown that the highest amount of nutrients is found in the hard outer skins of fruits and vegetables rather than in the inside soft parts. The skins of vegetables are cut into tiny pieces by the juicer. This releases all the nutrients accumulated in skins and they become available for absorption by the body . "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"CHOOSE A QUALITY JUICER A good quality juicer should be able to make a nutritious juice and be easy to clean. A quality juicer should shred up skins of fruits to release most of the nutrients stocked up in skins. In addition, it should have the capability to juice leafy vegetables. The most superior juicers make the best quality of juices but are difficult to clean. When purchasing a juicer , choose one that juices leafy vegetables yet it is easy to clean. For instance, the vertical slow juicer is efficient and easy to clean. Some juicers are even able to separate inorganic substance s from the ingredients you use. The advantage of such juicers is that in the event that you are unable to find organic produce, you can still enjoy your juice from available produce.
