a somewhat crude beginning at WellingtonHouse, grew a sophisticated organisation that was to shape the destiny of theentire planet, and in the process, change the paradigm of modern society.In this revolutionary work, which undoubtedly will have the effect of a500-kiloton nuclear explosion, we uncover both the Tavistock network and themethods of brainwashing and psychological warfare being adapted then and now forapplication to large-scale social engineering projects.This is the “Aquarian Conspiracy” as the brainwashers refer to themselves,referring to a super secret 1974 Stanford Research Institute study entitledChanging Images of Man. You can think of this book as essentially ananti-brainwashing combat manual. Brainwashing depends on the ignorance of thevictims. It is all around us. We can all perceive disintegration of our nationsin terms of day to day, personal experiences. However, this is not acoincidence. It is not an accident. What we are witnessing all around us is aplanned disintegration of the world economy by the most powerful people in theworld. This book on the Tavistock Institute attempts to show that the conspiracyis real, who is behind it, what are its final long term objectives and how wethe people can stop them from taking us to Hell.Beyond utter rage and indignation, the conclusion you, the reader will reach isthat the moral, material, cultural and intellectual decay that we are witnessinghelplessly every day across the globe, is not accidental, not an act of God whois punishing us for our Earthly misdeeds, but a deliberately induced socialcrisis.I repeat: this is not a test. This is real and what’s at stake is the future ofour planet. Welcome! Make yourselves at home! All the kooks of the world arecoming out in the most impressive Witch’s Sabbath yet!In the world of smoke and mirrors, there are no flukes, no coincidences and noaccidents. This, we prove beyond any reasonable doubt, just as we would have to,if we were disputing this case in a court of law. Only the highest standard ofexcellence and proof will serve our objectives. The stakes are too high and oddsagainst us are too great. What’s in the balance, is the future of the planet,the immortality of the human race and the survival of our species. We willprevail. We will succeed, no matter what the costs. There are no second chances,third options or fourth ways. This is it, and with this work that shall standthe test of time, I have drawn the line in the sand. They will not pass! We willnot surrender.During World War II, “Tavistock was the headquarters of the British Army’sPsychological Warfare Bureau, which, through the arrangements of the SpecialOperations Executive also dictated policy to the United States Armed Forces inthe matters of psychological warfare.”2Look around you! As the result of a frontal assault on our future by the world’sleading social scientists and behaviour engineers, the moorings of nationalmoral purpose collapsed. We the people have surrendered to a morally indifferentirrationality. Make no mistake, everything from the New Left to Watergate toVietnam to Pentagon Papers to the insane hippies, the anti-war movement and thedrug-rock counterculture were also pre-planned social engineering projects.I repeat, what’s under assault are not only our individual human rights, butrather the very institution of the “nation state” republic from the oligarchy’s“massive social engineering program conducted through Tavistock Institute forHuman Relations and other much larger, integrated network of centres of appliedsocial psychology and social engineering that emerged in the aftermath of WorldWar II.”3 These groups regard us and the principles of nation states as theiraxiomatic philosophical enemy.This interlocked juggernaut of evil consists of some of the world’s mostprestigious centers of knowledge and research such as Stanford Research Centerat Stanford University, Rand Corporation, MIT/Sloane, “the Advanced Center ofBehavioural Sciences at Palo Alto, the Institute of Social Research at theUniversity of Michigan, the Wharton School of Business at the University ofPennsylvania, the Harvard Business School,”4 London School of Economics, theNational Training Laboratories, the Hudson Institute, Esalen Institute, theNational Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Drug Abuse, theOffice of Naval Research. There are others, such as the Geneva-basedInternational Foundation for Development Alternatives and Executive ConferenceCenter, the first full-time Age of Aquarius graduate school, charged withteaching behaviour modification for high-level executives from Fortune’s top 500companies. Human zombies placed at top-level management positions to lead usinto the New Dark Age of transcendental consciousness. Two foci, first, changesneeded in the United States; and second, the global order.Over the period of half a century, tens of billions of dollars have beenallocated by the government of the United States with surreptitious help fromthink tanks and foundations aligned with Tavistock to fund the work of thesegroups.Every aspect of the mental and psychological life of people on the planet wasprofiled, recorded and stored in computer systems. Above the closelyco-operating groups of social scientists, psychologists, psychiatrists,anthropologists, think-tanks and foundations presides the elite of powerfulmembers of the oligarchy, comprised mostly of the old Venetian Black Nobility.What is the purpose of these behaviour modifications? It is to bring aboutforced changes to our way of life, without our agreement and without everrealizing what is happening to us. The ultimate goal being “the completeextirpation of mankind’s inner sense of identity, the tearing out of mankind’sinnermost soul, and the placement, in the vacant space, of an artificial,synthetic pseudo-soul.”5 However, in order to change mankind’s behaviour awayfrom industrial production into spiritualism and to bring us wilfully into theworld of post-industrial era zero growth and zero progress, one must force firsta change in mankind’s ‘self-image,’ its fundamental conception of what we are.Thus, the image of man appropriate to that new era must be sought, synthesizedand then wired into mankind’s brain.As Professor John McMurtry wrote in his 2001 opening address at the Science forPeace Forum held at the University of Toronto, “totality of rule is not the onlyparameter of totalitarianism. Limitlessness of power also proceeds from anomnipresent Center.”6 In the new totalitarian movement, “this omnipresentdirective force”7 communicates through behaviour modification and identitychange – the dominant nodes of the interlocked system.Psychological terror is not the essence, “but the punctuation mark of the newtotalitarianism’s meaning. The money-and-consumption command channel is thesecret of the movement’s success because it avoids responsibility for itsfailures. Wall Street prescribed market failures to provide for societies are,instead, always attributed to transcendental forces of “the invisible hand”punishing these societies for alleged sins against “market laws.” Thus ascatastrophes increasingly befall the majority of the world, the victims areblamed for their new deprivation, misery and oppression. This is a far moreeffective mode of rule than jackboot terror, which is more overt, but it exposesthe system to another form of resistance. To keep the majority in a continualstate of inner anxiety works because people are made too busy securing orcompeting for their own survival to co-operate in mounting an effectiveresponse. This too, has Tavistock’s signature all over it.“In the past decade, the entire population of the globe has been keptpermanently off-balance with one financial meltdown and transnational trade fiatafter another emptying national coffers and overriding rights of domesticself-determination. Populations have been so overwhelmed by the movingjuggernaut of economic and environmental crises that a rule of universalinsecurity has rendered social majorities paralysed by a low-intensity terror –the necessary condition for any totalitarian movement to continue its advance,because keeping its subjects perpetually off balance is its modus operandi.“In previous periods of history we have seen draconian measures put through atthe national level but we have never seen such an assault on peoples’ rights anddemocratic standards. Each new measure, viewed on its own, may seem anaberration but a whole host of changes as part on an ongoing continuumconstitutes a shift”8 towards total enslavement. Total power is a supraterrestrial correlative of global power, which can conceive of no limit toitself.There are many challenges for us to overcome. When presented with all the facts,when the evidence is neatly laid out on the table, when the conspirators havebeen unmasked and defrocked and their deeds shown for all the world to see,still, the ordinary citizen screams conspiracy, refusing to believe that such amonstrous, mind-boggling collusion is real... Until, it is too late. Be warned!We are at the crossroads. And the roads we take will now terminate whether wewill live in the XXI century as nation state republics or subjugated, culled anda dehumanized crop of slaves.Dear reader, the situation is extremely grave. We are fighting a combined effortof some of the most brilliant people in history who scheme against us for thepurposes of possessing us. But the human will is immortal. Tyrants have killedmillions and yet people fought and eventually won their freedom. Freedom stirsthe human heart and fear stills it. Amidst the deafening cacophony of patrioticsilence, insurgent voices command attention. Immortality has its moral basis intruth and incorruptibility. It deserves to be given all the support that it canget. It deserves to be fought and died for.Finally, history teaches by analogy, not identity. The historical experience isnot one of staying in the present and looking back. Rather it is one of goingback into the past and returning to the present with a wider and more intenseconsciousness of the restrictions of our former outlook.Francisco Goya’s Plate 79 of Disasters shows the fair maid of Liberty flat onher back, bosom exposed. Ghostly figures play about the corpse while monks digher grave. Truth has died. Murió la verdad. How is that for an alternative?Forewarned is forearmed. It is not up to God to save us, it is up to us. We willnever find the right answers if we can’t ask the proper questions.Daniel EstulinMadrid, May 26, 2011 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------1http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1980/eirv07n18-19800513/eirv07n18-19800513_022-tavistock_mother_of_planned_madn.pdf2 Ibid3 Ibid4 Ibid5 Ibid6 “Why is there a war in Afghanistan,” John McMurtry, Opening Address, Sciencefor Peace Forum and Teach-In, University of Toronto, December 9, 20017 Ibid8 Ibid"},{"pageContent":"Chapter OneCOUNTERINSURGENCYTechniques for psychological manipulation of society are about as old ashumanity itself. Feudal lords, to preserve and consolidate their power, foreverhave used punishment and torture as dissuasive agents of change. “Even thousandsof years ago, it was not the techniques per se, but their conscious applicationas divide-and-conquer tools, which aided the ruling classes. No matter howanti-human a particular technique or therapeutic approach may be, it is not initself counterinsurgency. Counterinsurgency cannot proceed merely on horrors; itrequires conscious and systematic application by the ruling class, or itsdupes.1 This was achieved by fusing psychology and psychiatry in the 1930s.“The first massive application of psychology as a conscious weapon took place,in Nazi Germany, especially in reference to eugenics, which played upon the mostbackward Aryan illusions held by and imposed on portions of the masses. Whilethe cause and development of Nazi butchery stemmed wholly from the worldeconomic collapse, its specific form, eugenics, was devised by the Nazi’sfavourite theoreticians and technicians – the psychiatrists.”2Since then, the “science of the mind,” has been converted into the craft of minddestruction. Legitimate, therapeutic approaches have given way tobehaviour-modifying pseudo-science in the name of aversion therapy.This conversion of the mind science was truly shaped by war – “the war of mentalgenocide waged by the bourgeoisie against the working class.”3 The essentialpremise of the work of Tavistock is the premise that certain kinds of democratic“institutions represent far more efficient instrumentalities for fascistdictatorship than the traditional, straightforwardly”4 authoritarian models.“From the great oil hoax and CIA-style brainwashing, the psychological scienceshave followed the route initially outlined in 1945 by Dr. John Rawlings Rees,grand master of psywar counterinsurgency, in his book, The Shaping of Psychiatryby War.”5 Rees called for the development of psychiatric shock troops in orderto develop “methods of political control based upon driving the majority of thehuman population toward psychosis”6 through procedures of so-called programmedbehavioural modification. He proposed this to render the population submissiveunder the post-World War II economic world order.Rees told a group of U.S. Army psychiatrists in 1945, “If we propose to come outinto the open and to attack the social and national problems of our day, then wemust have shock troops and these cannot be provided by psychiatry based whollyin institutions. We must have mobile teams of psychiatrists who are free to movearound and make contacts with the local situation in their particular area.”7Rees’ logic is clear. For true mental health, there must be a completetransformation of society along the lines of rational selection. But, as helaments in his book, “many don´t see reality this way, including most workerswho believe that any method of selection is a mechanism by which the wickedcapitalist aims to get more work out of the workers, and that argument dieshard.”8 In the Reesian world-view, such nay-sayers, along with anyone whoengages in “strikes” or “subversive activity,” are themselves neurotic,desperately “in need of treatment, but unfortunately unable to see that they areill. In such a world of unwitting neurotics, psychiatry, the only arbiter ofsanity, can be exercised only by a cabal in every country, groups ofpsychiatrists, linked to each other” prepared to muster all their weapons andinfluence for a move “into the political and governmental field.”9Only a “conspiracy of psychiatrists” – as Rees meant when he spoke of hismission – “could build a society where it is possible for people of every socialgroup to have treatment when they need it, even when they do not wish it,without the necessity to invoke the law.”10 For Rees, the construction of thatcabal became his lifelong ‘mission.’ As L. Marcus writes in his excellentinvestigative piece, “Reesian methods rely, completely and consciously, on thedestruction of the mental life of world society and a forced march intouniversal sadism.”11 Within this lies their affinity – men as beasts whoseminds, according to Tavistock, are something to be manipulated and destroyed.Since then, different methodologies of psychological warfare developed atTavistock Institute have been the central features of the activities of aworld-wide set of interlocking think-tanks in consultative capacity and specialcommissions, government agencies and corporations, their developmental studiesand pilot projects with the clear-cut objective of shaping political techniquesof social control. Rees and Tavistock organized their cabal according to publicdictum: we are not large but well placed.12 Rees had a clear understanding ofpower structures, of organizing key individuals who will in turn spread ideasand influence.When we speak of psychological warfare we are often speaking of ways to make theenemy afraid, and in order to do this we must understand an enemy’s psyche: whatmakes them love, hate, fight, run. That enemy might be foreign or domestic, anarmy of men or an enraged mass of workers. And in order to find an effectiveantidote, Tavistock and company need to understand how this enemy will reactunder stress: will he fight harder or simply surrender? Or will he start makingerrors in judgement, winning the war for the enemy, in a manner of speaking? Thecostliest mistakes of psychological warfare operations are always those made inignorance of an enemy’s mindset. This implies a deep knowledge of humanpsychology by Reesian “shock troops,” a knowledge which is itself a kind ofblack art. And since this is a war of perceptions, of “world views,” it isimportant that the psychologists and the psychiatrists and the sociologists andthe anthropologists, these unidentified little grey men in flannel suits workingfor Tavistock, understand the impact of art, music, literature and othercultural modes of expression and how world-views are represented by them...As Peter Levenda writes in Sinister Forces, “eventually, the temptation willarise to test some of these principles on the domestic population. After all,with whose mindset are we the most familiar but our own? What better place totest new theories of psychological warfare than among our native population?”13As Rees said in 1945, “Wars are not won by killing one’s opponents but byundermining or destroying his morale whilst maintaining one’s own.”14One of the key individuals involved in behaviour modification was psychologist,Kurt Lewin. Lewin was the father of group dynamics and one of Rees’s first cadreof recruits who began his career at Cornell University, “where he worked on asystematic series of studies of the effect of social pressure on the eatinghabits of children.”15 He came to the United States in 1933. A refugee from NaziGermany, Lewin, like many other German intellectuals was forced out of Germany“not because of any basic political differences but as a sacrifice to Hitler’sdivide-and-conquer anti-Semitism. Lewin, in fact, is noted for his refinement ofthe Nazi-formulated leaderless group technique into a sophisticated tool ofcounterinsurgency.”16 One of the lesser known facets of Lewin’s work is relatedto psychological warfare programs, especially showing proper relations betweenpsychological warfare, target-setting, field operations and evaluativereconnaissance. His first overt assignment was to utilize “groupdecision-making” in changing food preferences away from “meat” towards“whole-wheat bread” as substitutes.The following passage from his book Time Perspective and Morale, illustrates hisunderstanding of psychological warfare: “One of the main techniques for breakingmorale through a ‘strategy of terror’ consists in exactly this tactic – keep theperson hazy as to where he stands and just what he may expect. If in additionfrequent vacillations between severe disciplinary measures and promises of goodtreatment together with spreading of contradictory news, make the ‘cognitivestructure’ of this situation utterly unclear, then the individual may cease toeven know when a particular plan would lead toward or away from his goal. Underthese conditions even those who have definite goals and are ready to take risks,will be paralyzed by severe inner conflicts in regard to what to do.”17Lewin’s most significant proposal made during the period of World War II and itsimmediate aftermath, was his conception of ‘fascism with a democratic face.’ Thecommon psychopathological feature of all fascist’s demand is infantilism whodefines himself by his attempts to “impose the principle of the autonomousextended family, and to block out the reality”18 of the outer world. Forexample, “nationalism” (mother country), “racialism” (mother), “language group”(mother tongue), “cultural affinity group” (family traditions), “community”(extended family, neighbourhood).19Lewin was the first to realize through close observation of his tested cadresthat the imposition of fascist-like forms of small group organization andcorporatist “structural reforms” could induce fascist ideology in a subjectpopulation.In a sane and moral society, Lewin’s proposals would be used for toilet paperand Lewin himself would have been put under protective, psychiatric care.Instead, he was given a lot of money, U.S. citizenship and a grant from theRockefellers to craft social engineering projects.Lewin proposed that through a use of “small group” self-brainwashing techniques,a more efficient form of fascist dictatorship could be established. “The ratioand visibility of a horde of jackbooted enforcers characteristic of the Naziregime, could be reduced by creating fascist forms of small self-administering‘community groups.’ They see themselves as existing by means of their ability asindividuals to influence the behaviour of those immediately around them.”20 Theresult, thought Lewin, would be a more efficient form of fascist regime with thesuperficial appearance of special democratic forms. In other words, “if theatomised individual’s world is converted into a controlled environment whichconforms to such ‘fascist structural reforms,’ the victim’s mind will discoverthat only its potential paranoid self provides it with the means for agreementwith that controversial environment.”21 In other words, fascism is the worlddesired in the paranoid dreams of the “Id.”What is undeniable, is that Rees and Tavistock were seriously organizing “acabal to take over the councils of those who are attempting to re-establish theworld after the war.”22 Given the training of military, psychiatric and otherhard-core fascist cadres, the establishment of a fascist political order wouldproceed, according to Rees-Lewin Tavistockian model in the following steps: 1. Break down the existing democratic-constitutional institutions. The military and police forces would be reorganised for “civil action,” as they are now in the United States. One of the lesser known actions being readied by the government revolves around the “replacement of ordinary state and local police forces by a national counterinsurgency police force modelled on Hitler’s S.D. Gestapo, and such as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is in Canada.”23 At the same time, existing mass institutions would be destroyed by ‘spontaneously’ organized insurgency. ‘Local community control’ groups would be used to destroy broad-based political institutions. Among these recruits to fascist community control, gangs and counter-gangs of terrorists would propagate crime and mutual terroristic confrontations, with both sides under the control and direction of behind-the-scene intelligence operatives. This programmed insurgency of gangs and counter-gangs, mixed with doses of police-controlled terrorist gangs, create the political conditions in which the majority of the population more readily tolerates or even demands various degrees of military and police government, thus creating your “democratic” fascist regime. 2. Eliminate through subversion, assassination, military intervention, embargoes or popular and “spontaneous” uprisings the regime that has outlived its usefulness, and appoint “democratic” civilian government. The appointed “democratic” government can now function only within the limits defined for it by representatives of the supranational agencies.The specific topics towards the establishing of fascism with a democratic faceare as follows: 1. Area Population Psychological Studies. During World War II, the Anglo-American psychological warfare services developed a number of studies of specific neurotic susceptibilities of various national cultures. The most famous of these was the so-called Strategic Bombing Survey. It was conceived as a basis for co-ordinating allied bombing of Germany with propaganda and other psychological warfare campaigns against the morale of various enumerated strata of the Third Reich’s population,”24 and was the precursor of CIA-led Vietnam’s ‘Operation Phoenix,’ which was a genocide operation in South Vietnam against supporters of Vietcong. In a nutshell, Strategic Bombing Survey mapped out best ways to destroy the morale of the civilian population at the lowest cost. 2. The media. The use of control of major media news and cultural media as instruments of inducing desired forms of partial insanity among large populations. In general, by controlling the editorial policies, the news slant concerning national and international issues, the key news agencies and main mass circulating media determine what the population generally knows and considers credible. Deliberate and habitual falsification of the information is a way of creating “desensitization effects in the mass population by causing the socially-accredited interpretation of cause-effect relations to violate sensuous rational interpretation of experience. This is furthermore is supplemented by the introduction of programmed subliminal psychological material, whose predetermined effect is to accentuate infantile impulses among targeted portions of the population, such as ‘human interest’ stories which are relatively more gratifying to the infantile impulses and which de-emphasise a rational and scientific overview.”25 3. Local Community Control. “The object of ‘local community control’ as a fascist counterinsurgency tactic is to fragment the subject population into relatively hermetic political groupings,”26 narrowing the scale of the groups by separations according to race, sex, language background, regional background, national origin, recreational interests, age groups and neighbourhood. “Setting such groups into competition against each other under the conditions of general austerity is an effective Lewinite technique for inducing self-brainwashing among these groups and progressive psychological deterioration toward polymorphous perverse pseudo-families and outright clinical psychosis.”27 4. “The first degree of brainwashing is accomplished by setting ‘local community autonomy’ into principled opposition to ‘big business,’ technology, and progressive programs”28 meant to improve the lives of people within the community. “Programs with emphasis on technological advancement are denounced as efforts of ‘outsider elitist groups’ to interfere in the autonomous affairs of the local group. At that point, the ‘community group’ has become functionally semi-psychotic and clinically paranoid as a group. To the extent that the member restricts their social identity to within such a group, the effort to adjust to the group ideals induces corresponding pathological states in the member. 5. “By setting such groups into competition, and by splitting the group internally through sex, race, income, etc., the paranoia is intensified, the movement toward semi-psychotic is increased”29 as smaller and smaller sub groups within the community find themselves in cut-throat hostility toward one another. 6. The application of task-oriented small group brainwashing techniques to leaderless groups. “These groups operate on the basis of an environment”30 of reduction in real-income levels and working conditions. Under the conditions of austerity, the brainwashing consists in getting the workers “to make up for part of the lost standard income-rates by ingeniously speeding themselves up.”31 By recycling the employed and the unemployed and large-scale relocation programs and introduction of “group work incentives” and performance-reward competition among competing groups transforms the small production team into a potentially self-brainwashing group. “Under these conditions, semi-psychosis and psychosis cause the group to ‘voluntarily’ attain degrees of intensification of labor, which cannot be forced from sane labor. The members of such self-brainwashing leaderless group work teams emulate the ‘racehorse’ syndrome, driving hysterically toward literally suicidal work-paced. Tavistock Institute and University of Pennsylvania are two of the best-known centers where such experimental practices.”32One of the key areas of population control is counterinsurgency. Those familiarwith the adage that nobody ever leaves the CIA except six feet under the groundmay have wondered how such a control could come to be exerted. The answer liesin part due to the insidious methods of Dr. John Rawlings Rees and his Nazipredecessors. Peter Cuskie explains: “Before a potential agent has even beenaccepted for training by the CIA he has already been effectively brainwashedduring the selection. Rees’ ‘leaderless groups’ were, in reality, groups ofcandidates artfully manipulated by outside programmers in completely contrivedand controlled situations. In 1946, Nathan Kline who at the time served at WarShipping Administration of the United States, described an officer selectionprocess that Rees personally set up for the U.S. Marines shortly after the war.”Peter Cuskie in The Shaping of the Anglo-American SS by War explains, “Twentycandidates were gathered together in a group and told their future as a squad inthe Marines was dependent upon beating the record of all other marine units whohad tried to solve the problem they were about to be presented. Then, they weretold to imagine they were on a deserted island and the unassembled life raftbefore them had just drifted ashore. With suitable appeals to their ‘teamspirit’ they were instructed to break the record in getting the raft assembledand off the island.“Psychological warfare specialists standing on the sidelines observed carefullythe approaches of each individual in the group to the problem. Did heimmediately rush into trial and error mode of operation or stand back and sizeup an overall solution? Did he exhibit gung-ho enthusiasm and motivation orwithdraw in alienation from the situation? Which man would move for leadershipand manage to enforce group discipline and draw out ‘team spirit’?“When they had tabbed their ‘leader’ a ruse was used, such as an allegedinvasion on the other side of the island to pull him out together with three orfour others. This way, a new situation was developed where the psychologicalwarfare experts could observe the rise of a new ‘team leader.’”33One purpose of these insidious and artificial schemes was to encourage mindless‘team spirit’ and to select the most rabid and competent ‘team leaders.’ Anotheraim, when combined with the candidate’s Personal History questionnaire and otherwritten tests, was to compile a ‘psychological profile’ of each man for lateruse.Again, citing Peter Cuskie, “It was still necessary, however, to destroywhatever real ego strength the candidate still possessed. This was the intentionbehind Rees’ stress tests. One such test was used by John Gardner at the OSS...In this brainwashing scheme the candidate was given twelve minutes to constructa ‘cover story’ to be presented to interrogators who ‘caught him’ stealinggovernment documents marked SECRET from a Government office in Washington. Thecandidate was told that this was a make or break test encouraged to internalizea plausible new identity, and warned that his answers to his interrogators mustnot compromise OSS organisational security or blow his cover.“When the candidate was finished thinking up his cover story, he was broughtinto a dark room, a spotlight blinding him and three agents facing him. For thenext several minutes these brainwashing specialists would almost always tear toshreds the victim’s hastily concocted cover story by various ‘tough cop-softcop’ methods, well-prepared staccato catch questions, physical brutality, etc.Almost without exception, the candidate was left dazed and confused. Then thebrainwashing agents would abruptly break off the interrogation saying: ‘We nowhave abundant evidence that you have not been telling the truth. That’s all.’After the interrogation board had ostentatiously engaged in some whispering backand forth would come: ‘Your name is Jones, isn´t?...It is our decision, Jones,that you have failed this test.’“The crest fallen candidate was instructed to go upstairs. There a staff memberwould pretend to commiserate emotions and fear in this pleasant atmospherefollowing the earlier great tension. Most of the broken candidates would readilyopen up and talk about their childhood in response to questions like ‘As apsychologist I´ve been wondering whether there weren´t times in your childhoodsomewhat similar to this – when you concealed petty things from your mother whenshe questioned you.’ Usually, the candidate would naively and patheticallyramble on about his mother, his early sexual experiences, etc. By this time OSSnot only had its desired psychological profile – it also had crushed the lastvestiges of genuine ego strength in its victimized potential agent and was nowin a position to manipulate and program him almost at will to co-operate with‘the team.’“The most up-to-date utilisation of these Anglo-American SS brainwashing methodswas unwittingly revealed by the Sunday Times of London on January 27, in anarticle about the U.S. Army Special Forces entitled the “New Secret Service.”The Times describes the counter-interrogation techniques now used.“The four-stage brainwashing program starts with testing for sensitivity of thenervous system through flashing words or symbols on a screen for fractions of asecond – in order to find if physical torture or isolation in solitaryconfinement would better ‘break’ him; phase two is the breakdown of troops’identity by teaching him how to develop a ‘plausible alter ego’ (alibi); thethird phase involved brutal group attack or self-criticism sessions used tofurther destroy ego strength to supposedly ‘simulate’ enemy interrogation; andthe final phase instruction in beating lie detector involved amongst otherthings pairing strong electric shocks with ordinary everyday words. Thistechnique which would have obvious value for the CIA in preparing brainwashedveterans for hit squads is described under its counter-interrogation cover asfollows: These ordinary words acquire an emotional meaning for the man trainedfor a certain mission. Thus, in an interrogation, with a mixture of control andconditioning, the man’s response will appear chaotic and misleading.”34The OSS/CIA wasn´t the only one using the latest and most up-to-date systems andtechniques of counter-interrogation and agent indoctrination. Soon after,Tavistock developed newer, more and more sophisticated methods of mind control.Tavistock used various techniques of coercion, hypnosis, and the use ofmind-altering drugs to achieve brainwashing for their victims, “all of whichapplied the same basic format: Induce massive physical or psychological stressin an individual, and then relieve that stress.”35 Through repeated vacillationsbetween stress and relief, the subjects, be they army recruits, intelligenceagents or general population eventually became intensely suggestible.The OSS “pristine” interrogation “dark room” literally became the house ofhorrors for the newly selected recruits of the British MI6. One such secretlocation reserved for ‘Special Government Projects’ was at Powergen in Solihull,UK.The year is 1979. “The young British Intelligence recruits entering thisbuilding had no idea of the hell that lay before them,”36 writes RichardTomlinson, former MI6 spy who was part of the program. “No idea, that they wouldbe forced to become slaves to a demonic, mind control program run by MI6 andsanctioned by Royal Arch Freemasonry through Tavistock Institute.”37It was at Powergen in 1979, that a 21-year-old recruit, Richard Tomlinson,attending his first INSET British Intelligence, and was first shown a passportphotograph of Vladimir Putin, supplied to him by one of Oleg Gordievsky’scontacts. Gordievsky, the highest ranking KGB officer to escape to the West, wasa Royal Arch Freemason.The course was run by Stella Rimington (MI5), and John Scarlett, the overall MI6controller of the modules. The two Tavistock designed programs for BritishIntelligence Graduate Trainees were: 1. The ‘MI6 Beast’ programming. 2. ‘Smelly Cheeses’ programming in conjunction with ‘Jonathan Livinsgstone Seagull.’The first one refers to the ‘beast computer’ program, “placed into everyrecruit’s mind control programming during recruitment training at both MI5 andMI6. One of the tasks set the graduate trainees and mind-control programmers whowere running the Royal Arch Freemasonry course, was a ‘treasure hunt.’ Thetreasure hunt was to test their ‘spycraft’ skills and general sadism. Part ofthis course was based on an old Roman game, which the soldiers had played withtheir prisoners. The Rite of Saturn. In short, it was a sado-masochistic game,whereby the recruits were tortured and abused in a similar fashion to the Romanprisoners. This was called the ‘Via Dolorosa.’”38“Via Dolorosa was a Tavistock-designed water torture – the programmers inBritish Intelligence bring you to a near-death experience in order to make youobey. It is also a way of separating the weak from the strong. The programmerstorture the recruits repeatedly, in order to break their spirit. The key, aninitiate is worthless to them if they are capable of disobeying orders fromabove. Some people never recover from the experience. Symbolically, this is thebirth, death and resurrection process. The stages of the Cross; most initiatesare then taken to Jerusalem to walk the Via Dolorosa in order to reinforce thisprogramming, they have become ‘Christ-like.’”Smelly Cheeses is programmed in via the reading and enactment of Three Men in aBoat, a Jerome K. Jerome novel published in 1889. “Chapter 4 of Jerome’s novelrelates how it is most important whilst traveling and carrying ‘smelly cheeses’,not to touch the goods; nor afterwards, once one has arrived at one’sdestination! All smugglers are most worried about the safety of theirdrugs/contraband and therefore the importance of this part of theprogramming.”39In his self-published, unofficial biography, The Golden Chain, Tomlinson relatesthat “the other graduate trainee programmers were given huge electric shocksafter ‘training’ i.e. the enactment of this little drama, and would then beinstructed to sit on chairs facing a large window. This was ‘relaxation’ tode-stress the brain. The young men would sit there and grind their teeth (normalresponse to ECT) whilst gazing blankly at the sky. ‘Mr Blue Sky’ by ELO wassometimes played at this point, to ‘rejuvenate’ their spirits.”40“The main point behind MI6 ‘Smelly Cheeses’ programming was that prospectiverecruits to British Intelligence were sent on ‘gap years’ around the world onvarious ‘missions’ i.e. to courier contraband on British-dominated smugglingrings, which had their origins in the British Empire’s ‘snake-lines’”41 in clearreference to the Asian drug routes and especially African diamond routes.‘Smelley Cheeses’ programming was used in parallel with ‘Jonathan LivingstoneSeagull.’ Why? As Tomlinson writes, “to encourage and train those who had beenpicked to ‘remote view’ and then come back like ‘homing pigeons’ when called bythe programmer.”42Fast forward to late spring 1980: Russian Monastery Compound, Ein Kerem,Jerusalem property of Russian Orthodox Church. Back in 1980, it was run as anunnery but was known to be a KGB ‘spy-center.’ According to Tomlinson,“Vladimir Putin and the other KGB Royal Arch Freemasons, stayed within thishigh-security compound. The British Intelligence recruits mainly stayed at the‘Youth Hostel’ behind the St John Church in the center of Ein Kerem. It islocated partly up the mountain which overshadows the town and it backs onto apine forest.”43What is mind-boggling in this upside-down universe of smoke and mirrors is that,“In the evenings, the ‘graduates’ would sit on the verandah of these buildingswith their KGB Russian counterparts; to smoke, drink vodka and shoot thebreeze.”44 Tomlinson spoke Russian and acted as a de-facto translator for thegroup.Tomlinson explains that this was the first time that the future President ofRussia, Vladimir Putin and the now former MI6 agent had met.Fast forward to 1993. Poland. With the Soviet Union disintegrating intooblivion, Poland became the world’s largest flea market in the world ofintelligence. Possessing large mineral wealth, and large oil reserves, plus moretimber than the Amazon, not to mention an immense stockpile of Soviet eraweapons, the country was being asset-stripped. The strategy was intended totopple Russia into anarchy, towards the point where Russia could not opposeWestern military operations.“No one really knew who was working for which agency or which agency was alliedto whom, in what turned out to be a ‘smash and grab’ gun fight. One could nameMI5, MI6, the CIA and the IRA as but a few in this free-for-all; the desperatedash to acquire information, drugs, guns – you name it. Just about everyintelligence agency and mafia organization was in on the game.”45Everything was on sale. Truckloads of Soviet rubles motored down autobahns. Manywere used in complex swap operations in which billions of narco-dollars werelaundered on behalf of the Ndrangheta, the Calabrian Mafia. Numerous primewestern banks such as Bank of New York, Goldman Sachs, Fleet Financial and Bankof Boston looted up to $500 million.Tomlinson explains: “Vladimir Putin had lost his job as KGB controller of theStasi in East Berlin. There was a famine in St. Petersburg and the KGB owedtheir employees several months of salaries. Whole families were starving in thecities and Vladimir Putin’s own family was no exception to this rule.”46Putin needed help and reached out to the very people who supposedly were hisenemies, such as, John Scarlett, MI6 Moscow Station. Like Putin, Scarlett wasRoyal Arch Freemasons.Tomlinson is unable to shed any light on the deal that Scarlett struck withPutin but he does add several nuggets of information.Putin, according to Tomlinson, “had been under MI6/Royal Arch Freemasonry mindcontrol since 1979 and had been one of their operatives within the KGB until1994. Putin needed safe passage for himself and his family out of a situation inSt. Petersburg, which was rapidly deteriorating. Scarlett had agreed to set up anew identity for him in the UK as a teacher of German,”47 as Putin spoke Germanfluently.Putin’s two daughters and his wife would follow him at a later date. However,somewhere along the line, Scarlett reneged on the deal. Instead of a safepassage out of Russia, MI5, for reasons unknown, had decided to torture and thenmurder Putin as soon as he set foot on British soil.But British MI5 underestimated future Russian President, Vladimir Putin. Throughhis extensive network of contacts, he learned of MI5’s real agenda and calledthe deal off, returning to Russia instead.In 1994, Putin struck back. This year MI6 laptops began to disappear in Europe.Putin and his associates were tracking down the MI6 Senior Officers who held thecolor-coded information of the tailored mind-control programs for their officersand agents, within their laptops. Tomlinson explains that “once the codes arebroken, it is relatively simple to control any of the operatives listed as wellas guess how to control others who were ‘indoctrinated’ in a similar way andthen to turn them against their ‘masters.’”48The main clue was to be found on an antique British typewriter ’55 Imperial 55’at the Jerusalem prison museum. The code on the typewriter keys, runs asfollows: 1. $SV 2. XDM 3. KGB 4. RKK 5. AAN 6. TYM 7. ZKTZ 8. NLT 9. SKTZ 10. PF!The 10 sequences above accounts for 10 different branches of Royal ArchFreemasonry-infiltrated British Intelligence departments “from its inception(MI1) to the current, public form of MI5 and MI6.”49 For example, clue 7 is‘zygote’ (Zayin, Chet, Tzadik, in Hebrew) which stands for the Royal GenomaProject and clue 9 is sex kittens. These departments are all still in existencetoday.The KGB Royal Arch Freemasons were one of these departments, in thistarantula-like Masonic organization.The CIA wasn´t far behind the British MI6 in their approach to brainwashing. TheAgency realized that the more maverick approach involved the “role of socialfactors in skewing the minds of the agents to the Agency’s needs. In otherwords, individual brainwashing tactics, such as electroshock therapy or the useof drugs, though powerful, were no match for the power of suggestion inenforcing behavior.”50So Rees and his partners explored the deepest recesses of the human mind,adopting the object-relations approach of universal literature which emphasizedimagery and symbolism rather than instinctual drives and psychic energy. Throughthe use of associated theory, the idea was to recreate the imaginary world of animmortal piece of literature in the minds of the test subjects, using the workof art for immoral purposes. Under Rees and Tavistock, these techniques became atesting ground for new forms of institutionalized psychological control.THE BLUE BIRD OF HAPPINESSThe ‘Land of Memory’ has always been the primary objective of mind control andcounter insurgency operations. There is a phrase which is perhaps not used somuch these days as it was in the tender years of the twentieth century: “theblue bird of happiness.” What many people do not realize – and did not realizeeven then – was that this term had its origins in The Blue Bird (1909), the mostfamous work by the Belgian Nobel Prize-winning author and dramatist, MauriceMaeterlinck. In this play, two children set off on a search for the Blue Bird ofHappiness. This search leads them on many adventures – a kind of iniatic questfor the Holy Grail. Peter Levenda, in his brilliant book Sinister Forcesexplains that “many of the motifs of Maeterlinck’s play are repeated in theCIA’s search for perfecting mind control,”51 a search that began with ProjectBluebird.The story, “which begins on Christmas Eve, involved two children – Tyltyl andhis younger sister Mytyl – who set out on a quest to find the Blue Bird ofHappiness. Impoverished children of a woodcutter, who live across from a greathouse with very rich children, they understand that they are too poor to receiveChristmas presents that year. In the middle of the night, there is a knock onthe door, and an old woman – who later introduces herself as the Fairy Berylune– asks them if they have “the grass that sings, or the bird that is blue.”Berylune has a sick daughter who will not get well unless the Blue Bird ofHappiness is found. The children, eager to help, set off on a quest for themysterious Bird... and to visit their dead grandparents, with the Fairy’s help.In order to visit the dead, however, they have to pass through the Land ofMemory, which is on the way to the Blue Bird.”52I am taking my time to explain Maeterlinck’s work in order to help the readerunderstand how secret societies, intelligence agencies and government useliterature to indoctrinate their cadres into becoming mind control slaves to theelites. Blue Bird is one such program devised by Tavistock specifically for theCIA.Just as in Maeterlinck’s play, the recruits “are given a magic hat. On this hatis a diamond, set squarely in the center. When Tyltyl presses it, he will see“the Soul of Things”; if he turns it to his right, he sees the past; to theleft, the future; and as long as he wears the hat, it is invisible. Those whoread Eastern mysticism will no doubt grasp at once that the diamond is the‘adamantine substance’ and its position on the hat is a reference to the ThirdEye, which, when opened, gives the devotee access to secret information andoccult powers. The search for the Blue Bird will give Tyltyl (and mind controlrecruits) these powers as they walk through the Land of Memory, the Palace ofthe Night, a Graveyard, and an enchanted Forest. Eventually, of course, thechildren arrive back at their home on Christmas morning where they discover thatthe Blue Bird of Happiness has been there all along.”53However, for Tavistock, the play is full of occult and esoteric elements ofnecromancy treasure-quest. That children – virgins – are the ideal seersaccording to the occult texts of the Middle Ages goes unmentioned. The moral isuplifting and spiritual, conservative and charming. A fairy tale replete withtalking animals and trees and kindly grandparents. The quest itself, though, isenlightening for other reasons.The Land of Memory, of course, was the target of the BlueBird project: to enterthat Land in another person’s mind, to go through the drawers, rearranging thefurniture, and leave unnoticed. “Once the Korean War started, and American POWsbegan making bizarre, pro-Communist statements after a mysterious sojourn inManchuria, the world was introduced to the concept of ‘brainwashing,’ and theBlueBird took on enormous importance. If the Communists could alter theconsciousness of American soldiers, then the War took on a completely differentnature: it became a war of culture against culture, of atheism against religion,of race against race, of Darkness against Light.”54 This was a war not to befought by bullets alone; psychological warfare operations were ramped up at thesame time as BlueBird went into full swing, and what William Sargant would callin 1957 ‘The Battle for the Mind’ had began.Tavistock had obviously known of Maeterlinck’s creation, just as Lewin and Reeshad known of his other, more obscure works or of his studies of astrology,psychic phenomenon and mysticism. Maesterlinck’s description of the Land ofMemory had to strike deep resonances in the minds of the Tavistock team as theyembarked on their search for a key to the mysteries of human consciousness. Andso, the mind control programming begins.“In the Land of Memory – a strange land enshrouded in mist and darkness – thetwo seekers find their grandparents, long deceased. Their grandparents tellthem, ‘The last time you were here, let me see, when was it? ... It was on AllHallow’s, when the church bells were ringing.’55“All Hallow’s, of course, is the Day of the Dead. They find a Blue Bird, butwhen they return from the Land of Memory the bird has turned completely black.Only the first ‘trial’ has taken place, and Tyltyl and Mytyl have much fartherto go.“Next stage in mind control is The Palace of the Night. It is a somewhat moreeerie and forbidding place than even the Land of Memory. Night is depicted as akind of angel, a Dark Lady with wings in place of arms. The Palace of the Nightis the domain of Ghosts, Sickness and Wars. One goes directly from the Land ofMemory to the Palace of the Night, from unlocking the secrets of the memory tocommuning with the dead, controlling sickness and becoming victorious in war.Blue Bird, and its associate programs such as MK-ULTRA and OFTEN, becameinvolved in all aspects of behavior modification, hypnosis, drug-inducedpsychological states and the creation of amnesia.“Tyltyl finds a great door set in the rear of the Palace of the Night, and istold that he must never open it, the great dangers await those who rush in andthat no one who enters that room ever returns to the land of the living. Tyltyl,who is charged with the sacred quest of finding the Blue Bird, finally decidesto open the door. When he does so, he sees a beautiful garden, a waterfall, manywonderful things and ... of blue birds. He tries to grab as many as he can, andwhen he takes them out of the room they turn corpses in his arms. They cannotstand the light of day.”56The sessions continue. “Both, the brainwashing trainee and Tyltyl must continuetheir quest, leaving the Palace of the Night for their next destination, thePalace of Luxury. Here, they are confronted by a scene of outrageous depravity,as fat beings eat, drink, laugh and carouse, beatific in their willfulignorance. As always, Tyltyl – with his magic diamond (secret knowledge notavailable to others) – can see things as they really are, and by pressing thediamond he perceives that these beings are miserable fools and thus, exposed,they retreat to the Miseries, a special place from whence they may never return.Of course, the CIA specializes in “seeing things as they really are,” lookingbehind the curtain, behind the facade, and their entire program may be seen asTyltyl’s diamond: they put the magic diamond to use to see the human mind as itreally is, to strip away a human being’s conscious defenses so that everything,every secret – even highly classified government secrets that could cost thelives of many – would be revealed.“From the Luxury Palace, Tyltyl proceeds to the Kingdom of the Future. This iswhere he finds a land filled with children who are not yet born, dressedcompletely in blue and like little scientists. They are occupied with theinventions that they will produce once they have been born on earth. However,Tyltyl – as a living person – is not allowed in this Kingdom, which is under therulership of Time. From the Kingdom of the Future, then, to the Graveyard.“This is much like any other cemetery, with tombstones and grass and silence. Atmidnight, he is to use his magic diamond once again to see the Dead. In themidst of the darkness and impending horror, a clock in the distance chimes thehour. Tyltyl presses his diamond, frightened but willing to face the Dead as thenext in his series of trials before he can capture the Blue Bird. But instead ofghostly figures in shroud and clanking chains, the scene changes. The tombsopen, but instead of ghoulish entities only flowers emerge.“They had thought that ugly skeletons would rise from the earth and run afterthem. They had imagined all sorts of terrible things. And then, in the presenceof the Truth, they saw that all they had been told was a story and that deathdoes not exist.57The motto of the CIA, of course: ‘You shall know the Truth, and the Truth willset you free.’From the Graveyard, Tyltyl wanders into the Forest. During the quest, he hasbeen accompanied by various other creatures who have been observing Tyltyl froma distance. Many of these creatures – most especially the Cat – fear for theirlives should Tyltyl be successful. The Cat says: “It is better to rely on one’sself alone. In my cat-life, all our training is founded on suspicion. I can seethat it is just the same in the life of men. Those who confide in others areonly betrayed. It is better to keep silent and to be treacherous one’s self.”58This might well have been the personal motto of some of the sinister men whoworked behind the scenes at Tavistock and the CIA, men like John Rawlings Rees,Eric Trist, CIA director Richard Helms and the MK-ULTRA czar, Dr. SidneyGottlieb: Loners, desperately private men who guarded the secrets of the nationand the secrets of their lives with equal passion, since the two were so ofteninextricably intertwined, their training certainly founded on suspicion.In the story, the Cat leads Tyltyl into a trap in the forest, where he is setupon by the trees and the animals and has to fight for his life. He is saved atthe last minute by Light, who warns him that “man is alone against all theworld.”59Finally, the Leave-Taking occurs, as the hour has grown late and the childrenreturn to their cottage miraculously as the clock strikes eight on Christmasmorning. This is the Awakening, a constant theme for the CIA and Tavistock. Ofcourse, when they awaken, the children realize that the Blue Bird has been intheir home all along.Through an “innocent” child’s tale, Tavistock brainwashers have embarked on asacred quest that would lead them into humanity’s deepest secrets; by delvinginto the universal, macrocosmic secrets of the human mind, they hoped to uncoverthe specific, microcosmic secrets of their enemies. As above, so below.Tavistock used their understanding of psychiatric methods to formulate andimplement an action program based upon such beliefs. Once the neurotic map ofeach individual was determined, Tavistock was able to set up a “filtering”mechanism, that is different forms of brainwashing, to select various neurotictypes and place them in their appropriate settings.There is deeper symbolism involved in all of these Tavistockian processes.Tyltyl and Mytyl were innocent, virgin children, morally spotless, on aninitiatic journey in the company of Light. The men of Blue Bird and laterMK-ULTRA, could hardly be considered in the same way. From the point of view ofthe ancient mystery religions whose quest they were imitating, they wereplumbing the depths of the Abyss without having undergone the period ofpurification; thus their sins – their personal, private, specific sins – wouldcome to haunt them in the days and weeks and years that would follow, soilingtheir reputations and forbidding them entry into the Inner Temple.*****The psychopathic kernel of Tavistock’s long-range vision is therefore this. InCampaigner magazine’s ICLC Strategic Studies, L. Marcus explains, “The fascist‘structural reforms,’ local community control and ‘social contract,’ are theassertion of the unconscious infantile realm at the expense of the relativerationality of former socialising ego-ideals. Fascism is the world desired inthe paranoid dreams of the “Id.” Conversely, if the “automized individual’sworld is converted into a controlled environment which conforms to such fascist‘structural reforms,’ the victim’s mind will discover that only its potentialparanoid self provides it with the means for agreement with that controlledenvironment.”60On one level, the technique was applied to the world of intelligence, but a farmore hideous use was envisioned for it by the practitioners of the art ofbrainwashing. After the war, these techniques were put back into society andapplied to real lives and real people. Tavistock had understood that the familywas the most powerful psycho-active agent. One of their creations, “therapeuticgroups,” which we will analyse in this section, provided the opportunity to tapthe power of the family.The most advanced among the brutal practitioners of the new industrialpsychology was Dr. John Rawlings Rees. Rees discovered that an unreal realmcould be created: the social group. An individual is made to transfer his or heridentity to the group, wherein they become subjected to the most intense formsof suggestion. Provided the individual’s inner sense of real identity isdestroyed, he can be manipulated like a child.M. Minnicino in an article titled “Low Intensity Operations” explains: “Askilled group leader can use the group to create a powerful, albeit artificial,“family” environment. Once this environment is induced, a therapist canmanipulate a member of the group, not by direct attack, but by subtlymanipulating the other members of the group, for example through suggestion. Ifthe victim has been sucked into thinking of the group as something helpful(motherly), then, when that environment has been manipulated to turn againsthim, it will tend to have the impact of deep motherly rejection.”61Rees and Tavistock understood, through their extensive engagement in group work,that manipulation based upon bourgeois conceptions of the outside world asmagical (mother’s fears) was fundamental to mass control. In other words, theInstitute looked for methods by which to manage populations by exploiting theirideology. By first creating numerous social groups and then setting such groupsinto competition contingency, and making all gains contingent on winning theseat the expense of the contingency groups, a self-policing fascist social ordercould be established. It was merely necessary to atomize the subject population,employing an “armamentarium of sociological and psychiatric weaponry to theeffect of so dividing the people against itself,”62 setting race against race,language group against language group, women’s ‘self-interest’ against men as‘oppressors,’ further subdivide them by professional category and so on, and tofurther subdivide them into small territorial community ‘self-interest’ groups,that the military forces are “never confronted with more than a small materialforce represented by a hard core resistant to a generally effective combinationof sociological and psychiatric weapons of control.”63One of the ways in which such practices were encouraged and used by Tavistockbrainwashers involved increasing levels of productivity and the intensificationof labor at the expense of one’s health. In other words, Rockefeller inducedself-motivated destruction of the self, a society of brainwashed zombies,content to subsist on the brink of starvation, performing sadomasochistic actsof sodomy for a perceptibly irrational sort of psychotic holocaust. All of it isbased on a sort of perverse dionysian sodomic mindless fanaticism within thebroader framework of Rees’s Rockefeller model of fascist society. “The purposeis to function under a spiralling reduction in standard income and workingconditions.”64There is a method to this madness, however.For example, in an environment of downward spiralling standard income andworking conditions, higher and higher productivity is “suggested” as the group’sgoal, often at the expense of safety and the physiological well being of thegroup members. Anyone who protests is told they are maladjusted. “The idea wasto re-create a family dynamic, or a dynamic of peer pressure, in group therapy,where predetermined objectives were forced onto the group through consensus, or‘democracy,’ in the language of these social engineers. The idea was that byattacking someone’s sovereign identity in the group, that individual wouldforfeit their sovereignty to the group and become suggestible to thepredetermined objectives.”65 Such techniques play upon the “vulnerable person’sguilt, shame and regret with both sledgehammer and scalpel.”66 Humiliated by thegroup, with only the unreal realm to judge from, the individual further degradeshimself and accepts the verdict. He begins producing more.This is the malicious, disgusting kernel of co-participation, “quality of life,”co-determination, “humanization,” human relations or whatever other euphemismmay be mustered, all under the banner of ‘Post Industrial Society,’ a FordFoundation-sponsored piece of garbage whose particular point, as acounterinsurgency weapon of ideology, introduced the proto-fascist notion of‘Zero Growth.’As M. Minnicino explains, “The slave labor and death camp system of the Nazisare not quirks of Hitler and his associates, but an intrinsic expression of thefundamental policies of any ‘Zero Growth’ economy. It is impossible to have ZeroGrowth policies beginning today without mass genocide tomorrow.”67In fact, the idea for these programs came long before Tavistock was established.John D. Rockefeller Jr. began to push the savage “human relations” plans as thebest way to get more productivity in 1916 when he spoke at the YMCA IndustrialConference and then again in 1917, during his speech at Cornell UniversityFounder’s Day convention. One of the key proposals coming from the Rockefellercamp was to push a “democratic” employee stock ownership plan, because “it makesthe worker a capitalist in his viewpoint and this renders him a conservative andimmune from radical ideals,” and produces greater productivity, which is theaim.The 1940’s was the turning point for the Rockefeller strategy of behaviourmodification-brainwashing, co-determination, co-participation corporativism forthe takeover of the United States and world labor movement.68 As war wound down,Rockefeller changed the psychology of the workers in ways essential to the wayhe would rule the U.S. organized labor movement from then on. This was donesimultaneously on several levels.In 1946, Rees-Tavistock-Rockefeller was formalised in the RockefellerMemorandum, in which Brigadier General John Rawlings Rees exposed the full depthof his “cabal and offered it to the family. The Rockefeller Foundation, whichhad been heavily funding Tavistock and Tavistock members since 1934, readilyaccepted, and the Tavistock Clinic was transformed into the Tavistock Instituteof Human Relations.”69 The Institute developed national and internationaloperations under the heading “operation research.”First, Rockefeller took many of the social scientists who had been involved inthe bestial-fascist war intelligence services and set them up on campuses inLabor Institutes funded with Rockefeller Foundation, National Institute ofMental Health, Army, Navy, Air Force and large capitalist firm money, guidanceand projects. These Labor Institutes were created at the same time as the CIA,the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Council as part of the samenetwork that Rockefeller was building to rule the world, once the United Stateshad replaced Britain after the war as the world strongest power.One of the key Tavistock projects was Rockefeller-sponsored Labor Institute,where behaviour modification, inner group motivation, team-working, socialdynamics, productivity increasing, were all studied from the psychological pointof view of how to make them work to manipulate the great unwashed.By the early 1950sRockefeller had a network of labor institutes plus control ofthe Department of Labor to physically and psychologically control from top downthe United States labor movement.But Rockefeller’s greatest contribution to the “labor cause” has been thecomplete destruction of the labor movement, its perversion and control throughRockefeller-Tavistock orchestrated operations. From Civilian Conservation Corps(CCC) to Works Progress Administration (WPA), from National Civic Federation(NCF) and American Federation of Labor (AFL), labor movements in the UnitedStates were always firmly under the control of the Rockefeller financialinterests. For example, Samuel Gompers, the AFL’s first president, helped formin the early 1900’s the National Civic Federation. “It believed in the supremacyof employers and the benevolence of capitalism and helped break strikes, recruitvigilantes, and conduct attacks against working class. During the First WorldWar, Gompers championed the vicious War Labor Board that crushed labor. Amongthe NCF’s leaders were Mark Hanna of the U.S. Steel Corporation and suchRockefeller followers as Charlie Elliott, member of the Board of Trustees of theRockefeller Foundation and president of Harvard.”70 Another of the Rockefellerorganizations was Steel Workers Organizing Committee, whose director was PhilipMurray. Murray’s right hand man was Clinton Golden, who in 1947 joined theeditorial board of Tavistock’s Human Relations magazine and in the mid-1950sbecame a member of the Rockefeller controlled Ford Foundation.Yet another Rockefeller front was a Cornell ILR School created Coalition ofLabor Union Women, which held its first conference in Chicago in 1974. The groupwas intended to push Affirmative Action for women, pitting men against women invicious job fights with millions being laid off.“The three Rockefeller-formed and funded and directed labor institutes,Tavistock, the ISR and Cornell ILR, are only three of the more than two to threehundred that were started by the Rockefellers throughout the world after theSecond World War. They include the Center d´Etudes de Problemes Humaines deTravail and the Association pour la Recherche et L´InterventionPsycho-sociologiques in France; the Industrial Research Institute in Bonn,Germany and the DGB’s (German Trade Union) Department of Social RelationsInstitute, also in Germany; la Sociedad Argentina de Investigación Operativa(SADIO); the International Jewish Research Foundation on Human Relations inIsrael, and the Psychological Institute at Kyushu in Japan, to name a few.”71The list72 of Rockefeller influence is enormous. “Between the Rockefellerfamily’s long-standing control over the American Medical Association andAmerican Psychiatric Association, and the encroachment of the CIA establishmentinto all branches of government, various governmental, including military funds,were used to push the development of brainwashing and to plantRockefeller-Tavistock proteges in key positions and institutions. For example,B.F. Skinner’s position at Harvard was established in this way. Another Reesstudent, Dr. Kenneth Clark, moved into Rockefeller’s New York State Board ofRegents and also into the key black counterinsurgency post (MARC) of theRockefeller-inspired and Rockefeller-controlled Ford Foundation. Dr. Nathan S.Kline, one of the worst Reesian criminals, headed New York State’s RocklandState Hospital as well as held a key position at New York’s ColumbiaPresbyterian Hospital, where a broad and old tradition of brainwashingthrived.”73In fact, the techniques used in labor negotiations in Spain, France, Germany,the United States and most other western countries come straight out of theTavistock role-playing manual. It would do labor leaders some good to studyRockefeller-Tavistock techniques for labor negotiations. Or perhaps, with a winkand a nod, they already do. Is that why the Spanish labor movement is a badjoke? Let’s have a look.“First even before a strike a union is thoroughly surveyed. Rockefeller LaborInstitutes do psychological profiles on the union as a whole, collectinginformation on it through students who are sent out with questionnaire, bycounselling done on union members, by intensive questioning of union leaders, byattending set up discussion sessions of union members and attending unionmeetings, by evaluating the union’s past history such as its tendency to strike,for example, and by going over written tests and records of personal historiesof a significant number of individual members. Studies are done on racial andethnic subsections of the union. For every subsection, such as Italians, forexample, it is recorded whether they are from middle income, lower workingclass, newly immigrated, perhaps without citizenship papers, deeply religious,for a long time from a certain neighbourhood, very attached to one’s mother andso forth. Then the union and subsections are evaluated for how they react undercrisis situations: the pitiable psychological weaknesses, the neurotic guilts,the sort of horrifying images that produce fears in members, which will then beplayed on in the media, and subtly exploited on unconscious levels in governmentand other Rockefeller propaganda, such as the known fear of white middle incometeachers of attack from black gang youth, the points at which members crackunder stress, the methods to make them hysterically panic, at what point memberswill stop trusting each other, their intimidation by violence, what viciousoutside pressure will make them cave in and so on. As many as 100 or 200 studieson every union are done by Rockefeller Labor Institute.”74The methodology employed come straight out of a Behaviour Theory of LaborNegotiations, written by Walton and McKenzie for the Rockefeller-created CornellSchool of Industrial Relations. First step: The union is provoked by aparticularly low and insulting contract offer. The furious union comes out enmasse to the picket lines. Clenched fists and determined, stern faces areeverywhere. Rockefeller waits out the first few days. By the afternoon of thethird day, the union leader is spending most of his time in the union hall,chatting with his friends. By the afternoon of the fourth day, the shouts arenot half as energetic and few, if any faces hold the stern, determined look ofthe first morning.Tavistock enters the scene. The strike is to be crushed in stages. “The unionleadership is called into negotiations. Complete psychological profiles havebeen done on the personality structure, etc. of the union leaders. In meetings,structured like a group therapy session, unknown to the union leaders, thebehavioural modifier arbiter conducts psychological probes against the unionleaders. Most union leaders are schlemiels and can be easily manipulated. Thenegotiators and the capitalists know that the pressure of a media attacks, thetensions of the strike, the pressure from the rank and file, and the expiringstrike fund are operating on the leaders, making them internally wrecked.“Then, the leader is brought in for further negotiations. At this point, theyare close to begging for anything to take back to the membership.”75But, instead of better conditions for the workers, the union leaders are shownthe techniques to sell it to the membership so that they won´t think they arebeing cheated. How is it done? The union leaders and the shop stewards are givena course on negotiations at the nearby Labor Institute. Here behaviourmodification is performed. Guess who runs the seminars? You guessed it, loyalRockefeller psychologists and their staff members.However, the union penetration and eventual take-over doesn´t end there. Keyagents, behaviour modifiers, are placed into union positions, usually in theposts of educational secretary and attorney.“By the next contract negotiation session, the union leaders are more easilymalleable and will often agree to contracts in pre-contract negotiation therapysessions. Furthermore, attention is simultaneously turned to the membership.Psychological warfare techniques such as ‘cooling off periods’ betweennegotiations, smear campaign in the media, offers of conciliation, are used andare objective forces Rockefeller has at his disposal to break the remaining willof the strikers to crush them.”76WARTIME DEVELOPMENT OF BRAINWASHINGIn practical terms, Rockefeller and Tavistock technocrats used their knowledgeto break and then to control a powerful Coal Miners Union, who according totheir own propaganda, “occupied a position of unquestioned leadership in thehistory of American labor.”77 The project director was a Rockefeller man, EricTrist. Trist had written Social Structure and Psychological Stress, in Stressand Psychiatric Disorder – a piece of trash to be used in strikes and riots.With the post-war economy on a downslide and tensions amongst the trade unionsrunning high, an alternative was devised.Trist suggested that workers be appointed to the board of directors of majorcompanies. What was thought at the time to have been a major victory for labor,turned out to be a brilliantly schemed plan of the Tavistock Institute. “Theprofitability of the company – whether it stays afloat and the worker has a job– rests on outside world economic developments and internal affairs. The outsidematters, such as the global markets, are directed generally by commoditycartels’ control of money, raw materials, and so on. The inside affairs unlessthere is investment in technological improvements, rests almost exclusively onthe brutal speedup workers will subject themselves to at the expense of fatalaccidents and death. The operation to place workers on the board of directorsmeant tying workers to murderous speedups to insure profitability. This cameabout by inducing workers to internalise this ‘need,’ creating a whip in theirminds, and disarming other workers by pressure from their mates. In adepression, such schemes consummate in frantic, anxiety-ridden compulsion amongworkers.”78MARSHALL PLANThe Rockefeller plans for post-war Europe were already being shaped during theSecond World War. In 1946, Tavistock would become an important ally in theRockefeller fight to take over labor unions around the world. One of the keyevents that shaped that fight was the Marshall Plan.Named for the speech on June 5, 1947, by former General, and then-U.S. Secretaryof State, George Marshall, who proposed a solution to the disintegratingeconomic and social conditions that faced Europeans in the aftermath of WorldWar II. Under the program, the United States would provide “aid to preventstarvation in the major war areas, repair the devastation of those areas asquickly as possible, and invite European countries to join in a co-operativeplan for economic reconstruction.”79What is less generally acknowledged is that the “Plan” came with stringsattached. America made explicit requirements for trade liberalization andincreases in productivity, thus “ensuring the Americanization of Europe asEuropean political and economic elites became wedded to their Americancounterparts with no significant economic or political development taking placewithout U.S. approval.”80 Between the years 1948 and 1951, when the MarshallPlan was formally in operation, Congress appropriated $13.3 billion in aid tosixteen western European states. This credit was used to buy up Europeanindustry and the European working class extremely cheaply.As Mike Peters writes in “Bilderberg Group and the Project of EuropeanUnification”: “This unprecedented exercise of international generosity, dubbedby Churchill the ‘most sordid act in history,’ served direct economic purposesfor the internationally oriented U.S. corporations which promoted it.”81Kai Bird described the hidden aspects of the Plan in his book, The Color ofTruth, on the Bundy brothers. In 1949, “McGeorge Bundy, former Ford FoundationPresident took on a project with the Council on Foreign Relations to studyMarshall Plan aid to Europe... The Council’s study group included some of theforeign policy establishment’s leading figures. Working with young Bundy wereAllen Dulles (future CIA director), Dwight Eisenhower (future U.S. President)George Kennan (a key ideologue of the Cold War), Richard M. Bissell and FranklinA. Lindsay. Dulles, Bissell and Lindsay...would shortly become high-rankingofficials of the newly formed Central Intelligence Agency.… Their meetings wereconsidered so sensitive that the usual off-the-record transcript was notdistributed to Council members. There was good reason for the secrecy.Participants were privy to the highly classified fact that there was a covertside to the Marshall Plan. Specifically, the CIA was tapping into the $200million a year in local currency counterpart funds contributed by the recipientsof Marshall Plan aid. These unvouchered monies were being used by the CIA tofinance anti-Communist electoral activities in France and Italy and to supportsympathetic journalists, labor union leaders and politicians.”On the one hand, the origins of the Marshall Plan are, in fact, to be found inthe policy formation networks around the Rockefeller circles in 1942. “KeyRockefeller figures included Paul Hoffman, president of Studebaker Company.Hoffman was the leading economist for Committee for Economic Development, one ofthe Rockefeller controlled organizations. The CED devised some of the essentialwork for the Marshall Plan to loot Europe. Before this outright takeover beganin 1947, a torturous psychological softening up was conducted against theEuropean working class, including near starvation. In Germany, daily per capitaconsumption of calories fell to 1,300. Furthermore, the American MilitaryGovernment that was occupying the U.S. zone cut off the supply of home heatingfuel by diverting coal away from Germany. A systematic terror campaign began,with Reesian-trained death squads roaming Germany and murdering people... Partof the same operation was the selection procedure conducted by Reesianpsychologists to weed out the most loyal and true to the Tavistock creed as thefuture rulers of Europe. Workers rendered desperate, capitalists starved forcredits, rulers already chosen, the Marshall Plan machine for ‘reconstruction,’that is outright looting, began in 1948.“To guarantee that no trouble would come from the labor movement, theintelligence services, the CIA and the State Department along with TavistockInstitute, gathered key unionists to carry out the Rockefeller plan of reshapingand taking control over section of European labor movement.”82 These keyunionists were heavily recruited from the National Labor Relations Board, aRockefeller corporatist brainchild run by his loyal lapdog, Arthur Goldberg.“Goldberg was working with the social democrats within the European labormovement. He was funnelling OSS (CIA precursor) funds into the social democraticwing of the clandestine French federation of labor, preparing arrangements thatwould help U.S. intelligence take over the French movement after the war.”83On the other hand, the movement to form a united Europe was part of a largerplan to form a world government. The Hague Congress, held in May 1948, “calledfor a United Europe and issued seven resolutions on aspects of political union.Number seven stated, the creation of a United Europe must be regarded as anessential step towards the creation of a United World... The Marshall Plan,aside from helping put Europe back on its feet, led to the Schuman Plan in 1950,when the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman proposed that the entire coaland steel production of both France and Germany be placed under the authority ofone supranational body,”84 which in turn led to the European Coal and SteelCommunity, then to Euratom (the European Atomic energy Community), andultimately to the Common Market.ECSC was the first concrete step toward political unification, the first blockof the Empire building, the Empire being the One World Company Limited. With thesigning of the Treaty of Rome, paving the way for the European EconomicCommunity in 1957, the next step towards a future world company limited wastaken.*****What I have described in this chapter, as horrendous and unbelievable as it mayseem, is no myth. It is a hideous reality of the everyday encroachment offascism with a democratic face upon our society devised at Tavistock Institutewith financial help from the Rockefeller family going back over 100 years, tothe beginning of the 20th century. This ‘reality’, which if faced as reality andnot a figment of one’s overzealous imagination, can be wiped off the face of theearth. However, if that reality is not dealt with up front, then within arelatively short period of time, everything else we do as people, every hope wehave for a better world will come crashing down into a dustbin we call history.It is the Tavistock Institute or us, the people. There are no otheralternatives.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 1.

Abolishing our nation – step by step,” The New American, September 6,2004"},{"pageContent":"Chapter TwoTAVISTOCK AND THE UNHOLY ALLIANCEThe religious and mystical dimensions to the story of Tavistock are central toany study of the US government’s postwar interests in how psychology andparapsychology could benefit the intelligence agencies. It was Tavistock and thecabal of scientists who were the first to bring the potential uses of paranormalabilities in military applications, as well as the first in developing chemicalsubstances that would stimulate psychic abilities. This cabal included men, suchas Dr. Sidney Gottlieb, head of CIA’s Technical Services Staff, with shadowyconnections both to Operation Paperclip on the one side and to the Kennedyassassination on the other.As Peter Levenda explains in Sinister Forces, “swirling about the feet and handsof the Kennedy assassination was a sticky fog of occultists, wandering bishops,American intelligence and Nazi scientists. All were a handshake or two away fromJFK’s alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. They were all talking to ghosts,practicing ritual magic, holding hands around the séance table or sacrificingchickens in New Orleans apartments. And, in some cases, they were also membersof America’s ruling elite, the wealthiest and best-connected families in thecountry.”1The CIA was not the first organization to confront the task of probing the humanmind. Operations Bluebird, Artichoke and MK-ULTRA were designed to respond tosimilar practices of the Soviet Union and China, what was termed in the popularpress “brainwashing.” The show trials of Cardinal Mindszenty of Hungary was moreevidence that the Communists had managed to develop a technique for alteringconsciousness in their political prisoners; American GIs returning fromcaptivity in Korea were another example. That there might be a mysteriousOriental method to “cloud men’s minds” both frightened and excited the men ofthe CIA.In order quickly to learn as much as possible, they assigned psychiatrists,scientists and medical professionals to the task of finding out how the mind,and specifically memory, works. In doing so, they came across occult practices,demonstrations of psychic abilities, and the mind control techniques of yogis,shamans and witch doctors. Clearly, this was a realm of mind control that waswell worth pursuing, and which gave birth to some of the strangest projects everfunded by the US Government. It was in combination with the work of Lewin, Tristand Rees at Tavistock that these drugs, spiritual techniques and laboratorytests opened a Pandora’s Box of suffering, violence and perhaps even redemption,through transformation: the Black Box of consciousness. In this, Tavistock, theworld’s premier brainwashing institute, was unwittingly following in the stepsof magicians, sorcerers, gurus and cultists the world over. However, there wasone difference.Without meaning, there is no context for the experience; there is no way tointegrate the material into one’s psychological makeup. Tavistock’s director,Brigadier General John Rawlings Rees wasn’t interested in meaning, neither wasLewin or Trist or Adorno. That wasn’t their job. Their task was to open up themind to fast and easy manipulation, not to promote spiritual or psychicintegration, or what Jung calls “individuation.” Their job was to createassassins, turn agents, interrogate prisoners, obtain information, andmanipulate consciousness. Saving souls was for the priests.The CIA and the satanic cults; the mythology of the late twentieth century issurprisingly coherent even though the masks change from case to case, fromvictim to alleged victim. The CIA, of course, does exist; their mind controlprograms, from BlueBird to Artichoke to MK-ULTRA are a matter of public record.Their history of political assassinations and the overthrow of various foreigngovernments are also a matter of record. Satanic cults, or perhaps we shouldqualify that and say “occult secret societies,” also exist and are a matter ofpublic record; their attempts to contact higher spirits through arcane ritualsare also well-documented and well-known.Add all of this to espionage activities and you have a perfect fruit salad ofparanoia, power and prestige, mixing secret government work with secret ritualsand the manipulation of those sinister forces we have been looking at. Thesecret handshake of the cult and the secret code of the intelligence agency:they both evoke the power of relationship that is beyond the reach of ordinaryhuman beings.“Intelligence officers and cultists have a lot in common. Secrecy is a way oflife for both the spy and the sourcerer; they both use codes and code names;they both pretend to have access to mysteries not available to the generalpublic; they both claim to be able to influence events at a distance with theirspecial abilities and power. They both specialize in the manipulation ofreality; both are aware that things are not always what they seem to be; andthey are both ruthless and often amoral or immoral in the pursuit of theirgoals. And when one can so easily manipulate the perception of reality, oneeventually comes to the realization that Truth, itself, is a malleable thing. Soit was only natural that the cultist and the spy would gravitate towards eachother and would try to learn from each other.”2This control of reality, of the perception of reality and the creation of‘consensus reality’ is a powerful political tool, and has been since ancienttimes when the proverbial sorcerers could appear to create solar eclipses bysimply knowing when one would occur and act accordingly. To control andmanipulate the reality of the masses, one uses what is known as psychologicalwarfare. And it is but one step from controlling a person’s perception ofreality to getting that person to act on it.The CIA and Tavistock were opening a Pandora’s Box of demonic forces: the blackbox of consciousness. The techniques included drugs, various forms of hypnosisand even more extreme measures such as those developed by Dr. Ewen Cameron inMontreal, procedures known as “psychic driving,” which involves drastic sensorydeprivation sessions in an effort to wipe the consciousness clean and record anew consciousness over the old, much the same way we would record over a usedcassette tape. It is the story of modern day Frankenstein, or a laboratory fullof Frankensteins, and the monsters they made: monsters that wander the streetsof our cities today. Quoting Peter Levenda: “The complexity of the humanexperience is such that we can only wonder what trigger mechanisms exist inenvironment – on television, in newspapers and magazines, and even the Internet– that suggest modes of behavior to these victims that are dangerous tothemselves and to us.“It would be only a matter of time before the mind control researchers began toscour the records of occultists, magicians, witches, voodoo priests and Siberianshamans to isolate the techniques that were used since time immemorial tosupplant a person’s normal, comfortable, everyday consciousness and replace itwith a powerful, all-knowing and sometimes violent, and always deceptive alterpersonality; and to use those alters to uncover the action of deep memory, forMK-ULTRA was, at its core, an assault on the Land of Memory; the creation ofnew, false memories and the eradication of old, dangerous ones.“For intelligence purposes, in the search for the perfection, what was requiredof MK-ULTRA was the ability to manipulate memory. But in exploring the mind anddeveloping techniques for unlocking its secrets, the Agency unknowingly tread onareas that have been the domain of religion and mysticism for thousands ofyears. When the CIA incorporated drugs into the program and bizarre sensorydeprivation techniques, we had all the elements of a serious occult experience.Cults as disparate as that of Eleusis in Greece, Tantra in India, Siberianshamanism, Native American shamanism, Taoism in China, Jewish Qabalism, even therelatively modern phenomenon of European ceremonial magic – as represented inthe twentieth century by the Golden Dawn, the OTO, and individuals such asAleister Crowley. As mythologists such as Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade and othershave demonstrated, there is a great deal of similarity in ‘technology’ amongthese arcane practices, and that similarity exists for a reason.”3The arcane doctrine and methods of a discarded science are at the heart of thisstudy, because they reveal the mechanisms by which society in general, andindividuals in particular, have been manipulated by forces beyond theircomprehension.Again, quoting Peter Levenda’s Sinister Forces: “Magic was there when MK-ULTRAbegan its search for the secrets of the paranormal and interviewed witches andwizards in America and beyond. Ceremonial magic begins with the basic premisethat is sometimes formulated as the Hermetic axiom, ‘As above, so below,’ asimple phrase with ominous implications. Magicians believe that connections orlinks exist between perceived phenomena, and that to operate on one side of thelink is to cause change to occur on the other. The magicians operate in theworld of ‘non-locality,’ a world where the force may be an object, a wave may bea particle, and everything is in the immediate communication with everythingelse.“The magician pulls his strings, surrounded by an aura of deniability, an auracreated by Newtonian science, since science states that what the magician doesis impossible, the result of superstition and ignorance. ‘There is no such thingas the Mafia,’ stated J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the FBI. And the caposlaughed.”4Mind control and magic: not very far apart at all. “Thus, the magician is atonce an interrogator and interogatee; he is the one in charge of manipulatingand controlling the environment, but not for the effect it will have on someoneelse, but on himself alone. What the CIA has done in its interrogation manual –itself the product of MK-ULTRA – is to separate the magician from the ultimategoal of all occultism, which is the kind of spiritual perfection and elevatedconsciousness, and instead focus all the powers on occult techniques on anunwilling and uninformed subject, to manipulate him as well as the environment,to change the subject and transform him into something more useful to theinterrogators and of mortal danger to the subject’s own people. It is, in thejargon of occultism, black magic; and black magic in the service of the State.”5The doors of perception had been opened, not only by drugs like mescaline, LSDand psilocybin, but also by the séance, the shamans and the secret ritual. Allhad become tools of the trade for elements of the CIA, and their assault onmemory and consciousness threw open the doors of perception and, instead ofletting the Light in, they let Darkness out. Drugs, shamanism, and the occult.The dark domain of Charles Manson, of John Rawlings Rees, of Nazi doctors, ofHollywood and the music industry, the CIA and MI6 initiation sessions. Withpsychedelics, they disturbed the sleep of ancient forces, and the world wouldnever be the same again.ELIMINATION BY ILLUMINATIONPsychological warfare, although in existence for centuries, was really a“discovery” of the Second World War. Korea, the Philippines, Vietnam, Africa,the Middle East, Latin America, the roll call of psychological operations islong and, for the most part, classified. Taken individually, these psychologicalwarfare operations may have had a succinct political purpose, as defined andidentified by nameless men in grey flannel suits in the corridors of power, orby Presidents and National Security Advisors to further their own, hiddenagendas; but they were manifestations of something deeper, a spiritual war, awar of world views, a war we are still fighting, numbly, into the second decadeof the twenty-first century.By 1964, the use of occult themes and rituals became an accepted part ofpsychological warfare planning. The Special Operations Research Office atAmerican University “prepared a paper at the request of the U.S. Army on‘Witchcraft, Sorcery, Magic and Other Psychological Phenomena and theirImplications on Military and Paramilitary Operations in the Congo.’ The paperwas authored by James R. Price and Paul Jureidini. American University was nostranger to psychological warfare research, having seen the establishment thereof the Bureau of Social Science Research in 1950. Its African studies ofpsychological warfare were underwritten by the Human Ecology Fund, anorganization that was a front for the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program.”6 Some of thepeople involved in the research were the same Nazis who years earlier escaped tothe United States as part of Operation Paperclip. The relationship between theoccult and the Nazis shouldn’t surprise anyone who understands that the highestranking Nazis were contaminated with the ersatz paganism and popular occultismof the Thule Gessellschaft variety which had been absorbed into the SS withtorchlight processions and runic chants.OPERATION PAPERCLIPAs Levenda writes in Sinister Forces, “There had to have been a level at whichthe US government’s leaders identified with the Nazis, or at least admired them.There had to have been a point at which the crimes of the Holocaust wereconsidered a minor distraction, a kind of public relations nuisance, that wasovershadowed by the glamour of the perfectly-run superstate of the Third Reich.There must have been an understanding that the ideologies of America and NaziGermany were more alike than the ideologies of America and the Soviet Union.This is because there is just no other way to interpret what took place at theend of the war; morally, what transpired can only be considered a war crimeitself.“Policy makers in Washington knew that the next major conflict would be foughtbetween the United States and the Soviet Union. It was of utmost importance thattop level German scientists working on super secret V-1 and V-2 projects as wellas nuclear weapons technology, be brought to American shores, out of reach ofthe Russians and, more importantly perhaps, pressed into service to the UnitedStates.“To that end, several wartime intelligence operations were put in motion. Themost famous one was Operation Paperclip. Most people who have heard of Paperclipassume that it was a program to bring Nazi scientists to the United States toassist the space program. However, there was much more to Paperclip, and tosubsequent Nazi recruitment, than rocket science. Nazi medical personnel werealso recruited, as well as psychological warfare experts and, with the GehlenOrganization, spies, assassins and saboteurs.“The Paperclip story is long and very complex; it involves the alphabet soup ofintelligence agencies and programs, from CROWCASS (Central Registry of WarCrimes and Security Suspects) to CIC, SIS, OSS, CIA JIOA, and many more. Itdeals with dozens of countries, their intelligence agencies, armies, politicalparties, Roman Catholic Church, and criminal justice systems. By the timePaperclip was over, an entire division of Ukranian Waffen SS as well asthousands of Nazi scientists, many of them accused war criminals who hadparticipated in some of the war’s worst atrocities, had managed to find home inthe United States, South America and in the Middle East.”7Whatever the morality of the recruiting of German scientists, there was anotherdimension to the experiments that has gone virtually unnoticed by researchersdue to the near total lack of documentation and the lack of living witnesses.The evidence that does exist is largely circumstantial, but much of it can befound in the Captured German Documents section of the National Archives and thencollated with later testimony that turns up in memoirs, biographies of the waryears and its aftermath.The first evidence we have that anything like a mind control program existedwithin the Third Reich is the memoirs of Himmler’s astrologer, Wilhelm Wulff,“who talks about the Nazi desire to create a program within the Reich toduplicate the mental state of the Japanese soldier, a human being willing andeager to risk his life without question for his country, and the ChineseCommunist ‘human wave’ trooper, who would rush unthinkingly into certainslaughter. Thus, Paperclip scientists were involved with military and the CIAmind control programs, such as Friedrich Hoffmann, a Nazi chemist who advisedthe CIA on matters relating to psychotropic substances for use inbrainwashing.”8The Germans were among the first to study the use of psychological warfare; atthe same time, after the war, psychological warfare became inextricablyintertwined with propaganda and communications, and eventually bled over intoacts that can only be considered terrorism: assassinations, sabotage, tortureand interrogations, the domain of Tavistock Institute of Human Relations. Aspsychological warfare became more sophisticated, and the intelligence servicesat once more creative and more demanding, new techniques were developed andvirtually codified.All of these techniques share an ontological purpose: to manipulate perceptionsand to re-create reality. Once that Pandora’s box was open, there was no closingit again. The temptation was too great. For those who wanted to play God, therewas the next best thing: one could play with the elements of creation in such away that magical transformations would take place. As the men of the OSS, CIA,military intelligence and with Tavistock’s oversight developed from the armchairscholars that most of them were before the war years into soldiers fighting onall fronts of the Cold War, they became, in a very real sense, magicians. “TheCIA mind control projects themselves represented an assault on consciousness andreality that has not been seen in history since the age of the philosopher-kingsand their court alchemists.”9MIND CONTROLIn an extraordinary book, Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, MichaelHoffman writes, “looking into the subject of mind-control, one finds that thescope is wide and methods used are sophisticated. Mind control traces itsorigins to religious institutional use by priesthoods. Techniques of mindcontrol developed in our western culture were field-tested by the Jesuits,certain Vatican groups, and various mystery religions, secret societies andMasonic organizations. Methods tested during the Inquisition were refined by Dr.Josef Mengele during the reign of the Third Reich.“Soon afterwards, a mind control project called Marionette Programming importedfrom Nazi Germany was revived under the new name, ‘Project Monarch.’ The basiccomponent of the Monarch program is the sophisticated manipulation of the mind,using extreme trauma to induce Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD), now known asDisassociative Disorder. In public testimony submitted to the President’sCommittee on Radiation, there are amazing allegations of severe torture andinhumane programs foisted upon Americans and other citizens, especially aschildren.”10This wedding of the purely psychological with the purely physiological becamethe cornerstone of subsequent intelligence agency programs designed to uncoverthe secrets of the mind: the interface between the lump of grey matter we call abrain and the great beyond we call reality.THE CIA CONSPIRACYAs Peter Cuskie writes in The Shaping of the Anglo-American SS by War,“according to the OSS’s Assessment Staff’s post war report Assessment of Men, itwas Dr. John Rawlings Rees and his Tavistock crew at the British War OfficeSelection Board, who contacted the London office of the OSS to suggest that thespecial warfare organization adopt Tavistock’s selection and training methods.It was Rees who devised the OSS brainwashing ‘election’ procedures and Lewinhelped refine them. It was also Rockefeller-sponsored Rees who devised an U.S.financier-promoted insurgency-counter-insurgency project. The development of theCIA establishment has been essentially directed to a systematic infiltration ofall principal existing institutions, an infiltration, which is a deliberate,preparatory deployment, aimed at the establishment of a ‘quasi-legal’ fascisttakeover with the help of some of the leading families of America.”11Many of the future leaders of the CIA came from America’s ruling families, froma never-ending pool of bankers and industrialists, such as DuPont, Vanderbilt,Bruce, Mellon, Archbold, Morgan and Roosevelt. For example, Teddy Roosevelt’sgrandson Quentin Roosevelt was an OSS Special Operations officer in China as wasWinston Churchill’s cousin Raymond Guest. J.P. Morgan’s two sons Junius andHenry S., “were in charge of the laundering of all OSS funds and thecounterfeiting of all OSS identity papers.”12THE ROCKEFELLER CONNECTIONSOne of the people closely associated with the Rockefeller clan was John Gardner,an OSS psychologist in charge of “personnel assessment.” For over three decades,he headed Rockefellers’ most important organizations: The Rockefeller Brothers’Fund, the Carnegie Corporation, Education and Welfare Department and CommonCause, “a nationwide, independent, non-partisan organization for those Americanswho want to help in the rebuilding of the nation.”13 In fact, Common Cause was afront for a cabal to impeach and remove Nixon from the White House on the onehand and install David’s brother Nelson Rockefeller as the President on theother.Arthur Goldberg, another one of Rockefeller’s loyal servants, future U.S.Secretary of Labor and Supreme Court Justice under President John F. Kennedy,was placed in charge of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) Labor Desk. Alongwith Trist and Lewin, Goldberg would push counterinsurgency as a method of labormovement control.The list of Rockefeller supporters and representatives in key positions is awho-is-who amongst the “nation builders” of the XX century. Allen Dulles, formerdirector of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil Corporation, was OSS chief of SecretIntelligence for Europe and later head of the CIA. Dulles, a prototypicalEastern Establishment figure, is a perfect example of the invisible confluenceof fascist interests around the creation of new imperial dominion controlled byRockefeller through CIA-Tavistock corporate interests. For instance, Dulles wasput in charge of the CIA’s Bluebird mind control project, which he changed toArtichoke because he was fond of the vegetable. Furthermore, Allen and hisbrother John Foster were senior partners at Rockefeller’s Standard Oil’s chieflaw firm, Sullivan and Cromwell, a notorious CIA front with links to the mostimportant financial houses on Wall Street.Sullivan and Cromwell’s “twin” was a German law firm of Albert and Westrick, whowas simultaneously Hitler’s financial agent, “an Abwehr spymaster in the UnitedStates and Sullivan and Cromwell’s German representative. As a result, theDulles law firm acquired three major German concerns as Standard Oil cartelpartners. Among them was the murderous I.G.Farbenindustrie, which was, with theKruppwerks, the principal user of concentration camp slave labor for the Nazis’blitzkrieg economy.”14The Dulles family had long and extensive ties to the Nazi underground, and hadbeen laundering Nazi money for decades. “Both played major political rolesthroughout the 1920s and the 1930s in the ‘Rearming of Germany by Night’ policy,premised on using the Wehrmacht as a weapon against the Soviet Union andEuropean working class.”15 Allen Dulles was in an intelligence position inSwitzerland during the First World War, developing the contacts and the networkhe would use as the years went by. He would be one of the key people working theByzantine machinations of the post-war Operation Paperclip that formed the realstructure of resurgent fascism, of what became known in the intelligencecommunity simply as Blowback.16While Allen was employed in Switzerland, his brother John Foster was working atthe State Department in Washington. Their uncle, ultra-conservative RobertLansing, was President Woodrow Wilson’s Secretary of State. The Dulles brothersactively courted Nazi officials in the 1930s, as did the Rockefeller and WallStreet corporate interests, such as Ford Motor Company and IBM and helped themescape after the war, especially when Allen Dulles became CIA Director beginningin 1953. Dulles’ Chief of Counter Intelligence, James Jesus Angleton, later theCIA’s Vatican liaison, and Frank Wisner who oversaw Gehlen Organization’s‘Special Forces’ in 1952-1953, would be involved with various secretoff-the-books operations, among them Odessa, which helped relocate Nazis intoPeron’s Argentina and Die Spinne or The Spider, a loose designation of thepost-war remnants of the Nazi secret police and covert intelligence apparatus,whose US point man was a Rockefeller Republican Party supporter, Harold KeithThompson. We will come back to Die Spinne a bit later in the report.In 1945, Dulles, along with former Gestapo OSS agent Hans Bernd Gisevius wasaccused by the US Treasury Department of laundering Nazi funds from Hungary intoSwitzerland. The investigation was eventually dropped when the US StateDepartment claimed jurisdiction.If anyone still has any doubts about a close proximity of the Rockefeller clanto the Nazis, in 1945, President Truman fired Nelson Rockefeller for his role inengineering the creation of Peron’s fascist regime, which provided a ‘safehaven’ for over 100,000 Nuremberg criminals delivered by Allen Dulles fromEurope.In his national bestseller, Blowback, author Christopher Simpson wrote: “afterWorld War II, Nazi émigrés were given CIA subsidies to build a far-right-wingpower base in the U.S. These Nazis assumed prominent positions in the RepublicanParty’s ‘ethnic outreach committees.’ These Nazis did not come to America asindividuals but as part of organized groups with fascist political agendas. TheNazi agenda did not die along with Adolf Hitler. It moved to America (or a partof it did) and joined the far right of the Republican Party.”17From Richard Helms, a future CIA director and Dulles liaison man to Wehrmachtintelligence chief General Reinhard Gehlen to CIA director William Colby whoreceived his training as the OSS Special Operations officer from the SOE inLondon, the list of interlocking Rockefeller-Nazi-Tavistock interests isendless. The Tavistock techniques of gang, counter-gang, sabotage and politicalassassinations Colby “learned at SOE’s special training school were the verymethods he later used in directing the CIA’s Project Phoenix in South Vietnam”18which included the mass assassination atrocities at My Lai.It is one thing to generate a conspiracy during a period of aggravated wartimecrisis. It is another matter altogether to sustain and extend its dominionthroughout the period of apparent peacetime normalcy. As things settled down atthe end of the World War II, the Rockefeller-CIA set about to expand itsapparatus. In the process, they would try to permeate and dissolve the old order“to emerge as the hard core of a new imperial dominion.”19 The Tavistock – andthe Reesian method – that the class war should be waged with “weapons thataffect morale more than they take life” – has become, in the post-war period,the primary weapons system of the Rockefeller forces, including their own covertarm, the Central Intelligence Agency.For example, in 1977, the U.S. Senate Church Committee investigation exposedcriminal activities by the Central Intelligence Agency. Quoting Peter Cuskie,“among the most damning revelations was the CIA’s 25-year history of secretexperimentation with mind-altering drugs, mass psychological manipulation, NorthKorean-style brainwashing and torture techniques, under the rubric of OperationMK-ULTRA, and other programs. The New York Times ran a front-page story,singling out Dr. Louis West as one of the CIA’s top MK-ULTRA mind-destroyers.”20The Times obtained a West-authored memo advocating the use of LSD in socialcontrol. The memo, the paper reported, read in part, “This method, foreseen byAldous Huxley in Brave New World (1932), has the governing element employingdrugs selectively to manipulate the governed in various ways. In fact, it may bemore convenient and perhaps even more economical to keep the growing number ofchronic drug users (especially of the hallucinogens) fairly isolated and alsoout of the labor market, with its millions of unemployed. To society, thecommunards with their hallucinogenic drugs are probably less bothersome – andless expensive – if they are living apart, than if they are engaging inalternative modes of expressing their alienation, such as active, organized,vigorous political protest and dissent.”21Earlier, that is shortly after the war, Rees gave a speech in New York to agroup of military and civilian psychiatrists. “If we prepare to come out intothe open and to attack the social and national problems of our day, then we musthave the shock troops and these cannot be provided by psychiatry based wholly ininstitutions. We must have mobile teams of psychiatrists who are free to movearound and make contacts with the local area.”22 The overall theme of all ofRees’s known work is the development of the use of psychiatry as a weapon of theruling class. Rees’ 22-point program for the “application of military methods tocivilian life,” presented in his lectures that constituted the book The Shapingof Psychiatry by War, became an Anglo-American SS Bible.23 From Vienna in 1956,Rees, under the cover of his World Federation for Mental Health (WFMH) and FrankWisner, the CIA Deputy Director and chief of Special Operations coordinated thecounterinsurgency insurgency popularly known as the “Hungarian Revolution.”Rees emphasized the value of overt and covert operations through the use ofmilitary as a model of improvements in civil affairs institutions. One of thesecovert operations was the Die Spinee network.Through the period of the Cold War, the Die Spinne network was employed in acovert corporate and CIA-intelligence spiritual crusade to roll back the IronCurtain, such as the paramilitary operation known as the Hungarian Uprising in1956. After the 1963 JFK assassination, Die Spinne was de-activated in favor ofthe “Fascism With a Human Face” policy, championed by such left-fascist elementsas the Institute for Policy Studies.Executive Intelligence Review on Die Spinne operations makes an interestingobservation, “of Cold war operations, the Hungarian Revolt of 1956 was DieSpinne’s most famous. Amid a full deployment of British Fabian and similaroperatives to destabilise Eastern Europe’s Communist Parties followingKhrushchev’s ‘De-Stalinization’ speech, the Gehlen Organization’s special forcescomprised from former Waffen SS and Brandenburg Division Cadre, covertly invadedHungary and linked up with old fascists from the Arrow Cross Party which theNazis used during the occupation, to conduct a wave of sabotage andassassinations. It was these elements which formed the core of the so-called‘Hungarian Freedom Fighters.’ The command structure extended down throughscenario-design and policy-direction at the levels of National Security Council,the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, the Hudson Institute and the HooverInstitute of War.”24In the end, the CIA-directed liberation of Hungary failed because when push cameto shove, the Soviet Union was willing to undertake a nuclear war to preservetheir hold over the satellite states. The Americans, though rhetoricallycommitted to liberation, were not willing to fight World War III to achieve thatobjective. “Among the Nazis laundered through Allen Dulles’ Operation Sunriseand Operation Paperclip, for post-war use were SS Untersturmfuhrer Paul Dickopfwho would serve as Interpol’s head between 1968 and 1972. Interpol is aninternational private police agency which functions as a coordinating body forDie Spinne terrorism.”25A little known fact about Interpol is that it grew out of anticipation of theFirst World War, set up by the House of Rothschild in Vienna in 1923. The familyfelt it needed a special intelligence organization to watch over the interestsof bankers, who were financing both sides of the war. In order not to makethings look too suspicious, they called on Prince Albert I of Monaco to invitelawyers, judges and police officers from several countries to discussinternational co-operation against crime.With the abundance of proof, still most people would find it difficult to acceptthat the CIA is an adjunct of the Rockefeller-led organization that along withTavistock Institute is working diligently to change the paradigm of modernsociety. If we are to believe the United States Federal statutes and other mythsconcocted for the benefit of the credulous, the CIA is merely a key agency ofthe National Security Council, working with various intelligence agencies, theDefense Department, the Treasury and the FBI. The reality is quite different.The CIA apparatus has penetrated every key organization, including think tanks,universities, non-governmental organizations and foundations.For example, most major universities are either entirely or substantiallybranches of the CIA. At the University of Michigan, we have the most notoriousexample of the Institute for Social Research (ISR). Calling its work a“telescope on society,”26 ISR are notorious disciples of John Rees andTavistock. Then, there is Harvard’s ‘Russian’ institute, like Columbia’s, butalso Harvard’s psychology department is a covert CIA operation run for manyyears by another Reesian psychopath, B.F. Skinner, a psychologist who assertedthat men have no minds. Massachusetts Institute of Technology has always been aflourishing nest of CIA activity. The University of Pennsylvania’s WhartonSchool was home of Eric Trist, a Rockefeller-sponsored Reesian fascist, whodirected a series of social work projects. Cornell, Berkeley and Stanford arealso notorious CIA fronts.Through control of governmental and major foundations, the CIA has been able tohave a say “not only what programs are funded, but to control the selection ofinstructors who move into controlling positions”27 as honest academicians areweeded out and hounded into retirement.Then, there is the case of CIA’s control of private foundations. For example,the Rockefeller Foundation was established by the family on April 24, 1913. Thestatement of purpose cynically read, “To promote the well-being of mankindthroughout the world.” Another powerful Rockefeller controlled foundation isFord Foundation, whose head was a Rockefeller stooge and a CIA operative,McGeorge Bundy of the CIA Bundy family. McGeorge’s father, Harvey, married aLowell, one of the wealthiest American families and then worked under HenryStimson at the War Department. After helping Stimson write his memoirs, Bundyjoined Richard Bissell, his professor at “Yale during his undergraduate days, inEurope to help implement the Marshall Plan. When Bissell became head of SpecialOperations at the CIA, Bundy went with him again.”28 Bissell later would becomea Ford Foundation director and a member of theCouncil on Foreign Relations.What’s more, William Bundy, McGeorge’s older brother was not only one of themost powerful men in the CIA, but was also a member of theRockefeller-controlled Council on Foreign Relations and an editor of CFR’sForeign Affairs magazine.The Rockefellers also have interlocking control over the other most powerfulfoundation, The Carnegie Foundation. Leading directors of the Carnegiefoundations have for decades belonged to the Rockefeller-coordinated, Council onForeign Relations. In addition, twelve of the seventeen members on theCarnegie’s Board of Trustees are also associates of various Rockefellerfinancial institutions, including Richard Beattie, chairman of Simpson Thacher &Bartlett LLP law firm, a notorious CIA front and Susan Hockfield, President ofMassachusetts Institute of Technology. Another Rockefeller supporter is acurrent president of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Jessica TuchmanMathews who is also a regular member of the powerful Bilderberg organization.Carnegie is a foreign police think-tank interlocked with other Rockefellerthink-tanks and foundations such as Ford, Hoover Institute and Hudson Institute,whose senior fellow, Marie-Josée Kravis is also a member of the Bilderberggroup.When I think of this chapter, I think of Mona Lisa, or rather the smile of MonaLisa. Her grin is the grin of men and a few women who engage in the most viciousforms of psychological warfare against the human race. The knowing grin of menwho commit crimes against humanity. In this chapter, we have exhumed the corpseof Tavistock’s greatest architect, John Rawlings Rees and a few of his mostloyal henchmen, tracing the living trail of mind control and ritual killing andplacing them at the feet of some of our most important puppet masters.Let there be Light, He said. The skeleton key turned once, twice, three times.The door was pulled ajar with a squeak. Something moved. A shadow. Then, it wasgone.*****There is blood on our hands, and there are documents. This is history. You can´thave one without the other. Blood. Documents. Guilt. Innocence. Knowledge.Ignorance. Frustration. Fear. But you can´t know history unless you know fear.You can´t know history unless you feel the pulse of life under your fingers;unless you can stare the guns in the face. Unless you can stand in the prisons,and the death camps, and feel the gaze of informers and spies and soldiers onyour back in foreign countries … and on your own doorstep, your own driveway.History is not to be absent but to become absent; to be someone and then goaway, leaving traces. The rest is only bookkeeping.The world has always been like this, of course. It has always been run bypeople: superstitious, religious, fearful, paranoid, ugly, hateful, murderouspeople. That is nothing new. But at a specific point in the century we took thisa step further. “With JFK, we opened Pandora’s box, and the black box of humanconsciousness. We flipped open the lid, and rummaged around inside. And weloosed monsters on the earth. Monsters who feed on human flesh, and who drinkthe nectar of human souls.“With what we have seen here, one comes to the conclusion that there is nowhereto go, no one to trust. Everything we know, we see through a prism of a lens,cold, and calculating. For what else is a camera but a special device fortransforming and viewing our world? As any photographer who has slipped beneaththe dark cloth and focused a portion of the world upon their ground glass cantell you, the eloquent mirror of the lens inverts and reverses the world –optically, mathematically and magically. As we pose our subjects and view themthrough our lens we create our own special world and, emerging from the darkcloth are an array of characters who made the 20th century their own – JFK,Rockefeller, Rees, the little grey men in flannel suits and CIA badges, theirTavistock companions and all sorts of unsavory, crazy Nazis. It is The Wizard ofOz meets MK-ULTRA. We live in the most at the abnormal – even paranormal – oftimes. And unless we heed the reality that underlies the everyday, our failureto connect the dots will allow our denial to persist. With JFK front and center,we are awash not in the coincidental but in the subliminal, and the possibilitythat the mythic battle between demonic and angelic forces are yet beingrecreated on planet Earth. We could end this by saying, “We are not in Kansas,anymore.” Unfortunately, might I say, paraphrasing Mephistopheles, ‘Why, this isKansas. Nor am I out of it.’”29--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 1. Sinister Forces – The Nine, Book 1, Peter Levenda, Trineday Press, May 2011 2 2. Ibid 3 3.

Many of the mainstream songs youhear that make it to the top of the Billboard charts have very importantmeanings and significance. We tend to ignore things we don’t understand,focusing our attention on the words themselves instead of the deeper meaningbehind the words such as imagery, symbolism, historical references and theOccult within the lyrics. Combined with visual representation of the songs, oursenses are bombarded by a whole range of emotions that appeal to oursubconscious.What I am about to tell you may shock you so profoundly that you think twiceabout reading this. Be forewarned. You don’t have to believe it, but if you areprepared to disbelieve it, at least give me the benefit of reading it through,once.Words We UseMost people never remember the whole song but snippets of a song, mostly thechorus that consists of catchy words or play on words. We hum the song alongwith the radio until we come to the part of the chorus where for a few brieflines we happily sing along with the artist, mindlessly repeating the words wememorized. Let’s take a look at some songs. You will start to notice a pattern.We are in a crowded auditorium. Lights go out and the camera zooms in on twoindividuals on stage. A white man with a red baseball hat and a fouled-mouthedblack man in a white beret. “What the fuck are you talking about?” shouts theblack man. The white man, slowly walks across the stage, then pauses. “If I docome back, do you know what my new name is gonna be?” he spits back to hisfriend. “What’s your name gonna be?” asks the man in the white beret with anin-your-face attitude. “Rain Man,” replies the white rapper, whose stage name isEminem. There is a heavy drum roll, accompanied by piped in music from somewhereabove. “Put your hands in the air,” shouts Eminem, gesticulating wildly at theaudience gone numb from the noise and the excitement of the moment. “Say, RainMan,” shouts Enimen to the crowd. “Rain Man!” more than 50,000 people at YankeeStadium in New York shout back, hands in the air, waving back and forth. Overthe next 4 minutes, the words ‘Rain Man’ are repeated over 40 times by theperformers on stage and an equal number of times by the frenzied crowd. Inbetween, the two men sing in unisonYou find me offensive,I find you offensive for finding me offensiveI aim to be calm when I got to this level of famePossessed by this Devil, by the name...Rain ManLater, in Eminem’s “Old Time’s Sake,” he returns to the familiar theme.Speak of the DevilIt’s attack of the Rain Man.Chainsaw in hand.Blood stain on my apron.In fact, Eminem, is one of a large number of mainstream and highly popularperformers who sing about a someone called Rain Man. Others who use the samemotif in their performances are Rihanna in her song “Umbrella,” where the wordsRain and Umbrella, appear in the chorus and throughout the song, accompanied byimages of Rihanna and her dance troupe soaking wet with rain falling on theirheads. Others, such as rapper Fat Joe Feat and his “Make it Rain,” someonecalled Savage and his “Wild Out,” Black Stone Cherry and their popular renditionof “Blind Man” and Jamie Foxx with his particular version of “Rain Man.” Is it acoincidence that so many mainstream artists sings about a someone called RainMan? Or is there more to it? Let’s take a closer look at the words themselves.Foxx sings the following in the chorus:Release me.Ohhhhh uhh ohhhhhhh.Ohhhhh uhh ohhhhhhhRain Man, Rain Man, Rain ManRappers, The Game, in their song, “Cali Sunshine” sing:With more ass then delicious.That’s my flower of love.We make it rain like rain man.When we play with the glove.In Jay-Z Feat. Usher & Pharrell’s song “Anything,” we haveAmateur pole dancing.Come and get this cash from me.They call me Rain Man.She tried to rain dance.Rappers are not the only once to use the term Rain Man in their lyrics. Heavymetal band, W.A.S.P. in their song “The Burning Man,” also mention it. In BobDylan’s “Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again,” that appears onhis 1966 album Blonde on Blonde, he sings the followingNow the Rain Man gave me two cures.Then he said jump right inAnd again in “I Wanna Be Your Lover.”Well the Rain Man comes with his magic wandand the judge says Mona can´t have no bondHip Hop artist Ya Boy pays tribute to the Rain Man in his likewise titled track.Hey everybody say Mr. Rain Man can we have a rainy day?Bring an umbrella Please bring an umbrella ella ella ella ehh.Former country music superstar Tanya Tucker also sings up to the Rain Man in atrack titled “Lizzie and the Rain Man.”But there was one named Lizzy Cooper,Who said he was a lying cheat.She said you call yourself the Rain ManWell you ought to be ashamed.Then, things get really interesting and very explicit and in your face. Forexample, listen to Jay-Z’s D´evils.Dear God. I wonder can you save me?Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body...Dear God. I wonder can you save me?Secret Society. Tryin´ to keep their eye on me...And to Tupac who was killed in what is believed to have been an assassination.Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep.Niggas at the party with their shotties just as rowdy as me.A superstar rapper, Fatboy Slim also mentions them in his song titled,Illuminati.Illuminati, a secret society do exist, Illuminati-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti.And LLCool J in “I shot ya”Illuminati want my mind and my body. Secret SocietyTrying to keep their eye on me.Now, instead of reading these lyrics as a form of amusement, ask yourselves:what if what they are singing is for real? What if someone is trying to tell yousomething in such an unbelievable, Tavistockian way, in your face, where youcould best see it? What if the people who are trying to tell you something arethe very secret societies and brainwashing institutes who are trying to controlthe world from behind the scenes? And what if I told you that there is no suchthing as coincidences in the world of spies and secret societies, in the worldof smoke and mirrors, in the parallel universe where government work theirsecret agenda from behind the curtain? Now, read the next set of lyrics fromProdigy. The track is titled “Illuminati.”It took me 33 years for me to see the truth.Ever so clear IWas too youngI couldn´t articulate myself the right waySon, but now let me break it down, pass it all around, thisIs not a theory.The conspiracy is real.They wanna put me inA straight jacket in a padded room and tell the worldThere’s 12 monkeys so they can be confused.Illuminati want my mind soul and my bodySecret Society trying to keep their eye on me.So, why would all these allegedly uncooth rappers, country musicians and rockerssing about a something called the Illuminati, the New World Order, Rain Man andUmbrella? In fact, it is becoming even more widespread and common. Listen to arapper Puff Daddy in “Young G’s”:Niggaz that got killed in the field and all the babies bornKnow they ain´t fully prepared for this New World Order.And it’s not just lyrics that contain these references. Music videos are alsofull of occult symbolism such as Ankh (ancient Egyptian symbol for EternalLife), all-seeing Eye of God, Pentacles and pyramids, not to mention the Masonicblack and white checkered floor. We can imagine what a New World Order is and wehave heard of the Iluminati, thanks in part to Dan Brown’s popular fiction, butwho is this Rain Man?WHY IN PLAIN SIGHT?You might be wondering why, if a conspiracy of silence to control the worldtruly exists, the supposed Masters of the Universe, instead of hiding it, electto promote it through songs, videos and Hollywood film. The truth of the matteris that secret societies love to hide things in plain sight. And not onlythrough videos and lyrics. What if I told you that the JFK assassination was aritual slaying, what is known in the world of the occult as “the killing of theKing?” What if I gave you enough evidence to show you that this is so, despitethe official version of the events, wherein we are told a lone assassin killedthe President with a magic bullet?To understand the Kennedy assassination and place it within the realm ofTavistock mind control, secret societies, One World conspiracy and Nazi occult,you must open the doors of perception into a nether world of the unknown bychanging the way we look upon the details and the fantastic convergences oflife. This is the way ancient man perceived the world, “encompassing a visionthat detects every link and every symbol, beginning with the significance ofnames, then places, necessarily including lines of latitude and longitude andthe divisions of degrees in geography and cartography and then the obsessiveactions which stem from the confluence of the two and which have come to beknown as ritual.”1Symbolism and other types of references can be flagrant and subconsciouslypicked up, but on a conscious level will not be seen by the naked eye. In filmand videos, this type of subliminal messaging is achieved using scenes thatcontain brief flashes of light and dark in quickly alternating video frames.At times, the symbolism is blatantly clear and easily identifiable, but becausethe meaning or references behind it are unknown to most people, the brain simplyfilters it out as insignificant and meaningless. However, none of it ismeaningless. You will be shocked to see how nothing was left to chance in theJFK assassination, despite the apparent scenes of chaos and disconcert.In penetrating the secrets of secret societies and symbols, it would be helpfulto consider a dictum of Einsteinian physics, write James Shelby Downard andMichael A. Hoffman II: “Time relations among events are assumed to be firstconstituted by the specific physical relations obtaining between them.”2 Secretsocieties, Masonic lodges, cults and spooks use secret symbols to show theiraffiliation. The eternal pagan psychodrama is escalated under these ‘modern’conditions precisely because sorcery is not what 20th century man can accept asreal.In their underground bestseller, “King-Kill/33,” James Shelby Downard andMichael A. Hoffman II explain the mechanics of the assassination: “Keep in mindthat the ultimate purpose of John Fitzgerald Kennedy’s assassination was notpolitical or economic but sorcerous: for the control of the dreaming mind andthe marshalling of its forces is the omnipotent force in this entire scenario oflies, cruelty and degradation. Remember that once you spread the deadly virus,the disease will do the rest. Something died in the American people on November22, 1963 – call it idealism, innocence or the quest for moral excellence. It isthe transformation of human beings, which is the authentic reason and motive forthe Kennedy murder.”3The more one studies mind control, secret societies and the occult, “the moreone understands the subtlety and hidden symbolism, the so-called ‘science ofnames’ word wizardry behind the scenes of Kennedy assassination. The JFKassassination encounters this science in a decisive way and contains a veritablenightmare of symbol-complexes having to do with violence, perversion,conspiracy, death and degradation.”4 Let’s take a closer look.THE KILLING OF THE KINGJames Shelby Downard’s underground classic Sorcery, Sex, Assassination and theScience of Symbolism, links American historical events with a grand occult planof secret societies. His investigative work on the startling links within theKennedy assassination has remained unmatched long after his death. Downwardwrites,“President Kennedy and his wife left the Temple Houston and were met at midnightby tireless crowds present to cheer the virile ‘Sun God’ and his dazzlinglyerotic wife, the ‘Queen of Love and Beauty,’ in Fort Worth. On the morning ofNovember 22, they flew to Gate 28 at Love Field, Dallas, Texas. The number 28 isone of the correspondences of Solomon in kabbalistic numerology; the Solomonicname assigned to 28 is ‘Beale.’“On the 28th degree of latitude in the state of Texas is the site of what wasonce the giant ‘Kennedy ranch.’ On the 28th degree is also Cape Canaveral fromwhich the moon flight was launched – made possible not only by the President’svarious feats but by his death as well, for the placing of the Freemasons on themoon could occur only after the Killing of the King. The 28th degree ofTemplarism is the ‘King of the Sun’ degree. The President and First Lady arrivedin Air Force One, code-named ‘Angel.’“The motorcade proceeded from Love Field to Dealey Plaza. Dealey Plaza is thesite of the Masonic temple in Dallas (now razed) and there is a marker attestingto this fact in the plaza.“Important ‘protective’ strategy for Dealey Plaza was planned by the New OrleansCIA station whose headquarters were a Masonic temple building. Dallas, Texas islocated ten miles north of the 33rd degree of latitude. The 33rd degree is thehighest in Freemasonry and the founding lodge of the Scottish Rite in Americawas created in Charleston, South Carolina, exactly on the 33rd degree line.“Dealey Plaza is close to the Trinity River, which before the introduction offlood control measures submerged the place regularly. Dealey Plaza thereforesymbolises both the trident and its bearer, the water-god Neptune. To thistrident-Neptune site came the ‘Queen of Love and Beauty’ and her spouse, thescapegoat, in the Killing of the King rite, the ‘Ceannaideach’ (Gaelic word forUgly Head or Wounded Head). Now, get this: the “Queen” is Jackie and“Ceannaideach” is the Gaelic form of Kennedy. In Scotland, the Kennedy coat ofarms and iconography is full of folklore. Their Plant Badge is an oak and theirCrest has a dolphin on it. Now what could be more coincidental than for JFK toget shot in the head near the oak tree at Dealey Plaza. Do you call that acoincidence?“At 12:22 p.m. the motorcade proceeded down Main Street toward the TripleUnderpass, travelling first down Elm St. The latter was the scene of numerousgun fights, stabbings and other violence, and it is the location of the MajesticTheatre, the pawn shop/negro district, and industrial district.“Elm, Main, and Commerce form a trident pattern in alignment with the tripleunderpass as any Dallas map will show. Many analysts contend that at least threeassassins were involved in the crossfire ambush of Kennedy.“It is a prime tenet of Masonry that its assassins come in threes. Masonicassassins are known in the code of the lodge as the ‘unworthy craftsmen.’ HiramAbiff, architect of Solomon’s Temple and mythic progenitor of Freemasonry wasmurdered according to Masonic legend by three ‘unworthy craftsmen.’ BecauseMasonry is obsessed with earth-as-gameboard (tessellation, thus the checkeredMasonic floor) and the ancillary alignments necessary to facilitate the ‘game,’it is inordinately concerned with railroads and railroad personnel to the extentthat outside of lawyers and circus performers, no other vocation has a higherpercentage of Masons than railroad workers.“Minutes after John Fitzgerald Kennedy was murdered three ‘hoboes’ (‘unworthycraftsmen’) were arrested at the railyard behind Dealey Plaza.“No records of their identities have ever been revealed nor the ‘identity’ ofthe arresting officer. All that remains of those few minutes are a series ofphotographs, a ritual accompaniment of the Black Mass that was the ceremonialimmolation of a king, the unmistakable calling card of Masonic murder, theappearance of Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum, the three ‘unworthy craftsmen,’ ‘thatwill not be blamed for nothing.’ This ritual symbolism is necessary for theaccomplishment of the alchemical intention of the killing of the ‘King ofCamelot.’“Dealey Plaza breaks down symbolically in this manner: “Dea” means “goddess” inLatin and “Ley” can pertain to the law or rule in the Spanish, or lines ofpreternatural geographic significance in the pre-Christian nature religions ofthe English.“The systematic arrangement and pattern of symbolic things having to do with thekilling of Kennedy indicates that he was a scapegoat in a sacrifice. The purposeof such macabre ritualism is further recognizable in patterns of symbolismculminating in the final ‘making manifest all that is hidden.’LEE HARVEY OSWALD“Oswald means ‘divine strength.’ The diminutive form of the word is ‘os’ or‘Oz’: denoting strength. Divine strength is integral to the King-killing rite.The role which ‘Divine Strength’ played in the Dealey ‘Goddess Rule’ Killing ofthe King ritual should be given careful consideration.“One should also note the significance of (Jack) Ruby’s killing (destroying) of‘Ozwald’ in reference to the ‘Ruby Slippers’ of The Wizard of Oz which one mayderide as a fairy tale but which nevertheless symbolizes the immense power of‘ruby light,’ otherwise known as the laser.“Oswald may have undergone biotelemetry implantation in the Soviet Union while a‘volunteer’ at a Behavior Control Center at Minsk. Oswald roomed with Cubans andwas allegedly friendly with a Castro-man identified only as being a ‘key man.’The ‘key,’ of course, is one of the most important symbols in Masonry and thesymbol of silence.ARLINGTON NECROLOGY“The Kennedy and Oswald burials were both at ‘Arlington’: JFK at the NationalCemetery near Washington, D.C., and Oswald at Rosehill Cemetery near Arlington,Texas. ‘Arlington’ is a word of significance in Masonic sorcery and mysticismand it has a hidden meaning that ties in with necrolatry.“At the Kennedy gravesite there is a stone circle and in its middle a fire thatis called an ‘eternal flame.’ The fire in the middle of the circle represents apoint in the circle, the same type of symbolism that is recognisable inKennedy’s bier and coffin being in the Center of the rotunda in the Capitol. Apoint in a circle symbolized the sun in ancient sun worship. It was also asymbol of fecundity, with the point symbolizing a phallus and the circle avagina.FUNERARY RITES“In the ancient mysteries the aspirant could not claim a participation in thehighest secrets until he had been placed in the Pastos, bed or coffin. Theplacing of him in the coffin was called the symbolical death of the mysteries,and his deliverance was termed a rising from the dead; the ‘mind,’ says anancient writer quoted by Stobaeus, is afflicted in death just as it is in theinitiation in the mysteries. And word answers to word, as well as thing tothing; for burial is to die and death to be initiated. The coffin in Masonry isfound on the tracing boards of the early part of the last century, and hasalways constituted a part of the symbolism of the Third Degree, where thereference is precisely to the same as that of the Pastos in the ancientmysteries.5“President Kennedy sat at the head of a coffin table at the White House. To hisback, over a fireplace, hung a portrait of Abraham Lincoln, an assassinatedpresident. On either side of the picture were urns that resembled the typecalled ‘cinerary urns’ which are vessels in which the ashes of the dead arekept.“A book about JFK was called Three Steps to the White House. In Masonry are whatis known as the ‘three symbolical steps.’ ‘The three grand steps symbolicallylead from this life to the source of all knowledge.’6“It must be evident to every Master Mason without further explanation, that thethree steps are taken from the darkness to a place of light, either figurativelyor really over a coffin, the symbol of death, to teach symbolically that thepassage from darkness and ignorance of this life through death to the light andknowledge of eternal life. And this from earliest times was the true symbolismof the step.7“The body of President Kennedy was placed in a coffin, which was positioned inthe Center of a circle under the Capitol dome. The catafalque was “a temporarystructure of wood appropriately decorated with funeral symbols and representinga tomb or cenotaph. It forms a part of the decorations of a ‘Sorrow Lodge.’”This Masonic Encyclopedia entry refers to the ceremonies of the Third Degree inLodges of the French Rite.“Pictures taken of the Kennedy coffin and catafalque show these two props of thefunerary rite as a point in a circle. Fecundity is the symbolic signification ofthe Point within a circle and is a derivation of ancient sun worship.“In the lore of mystery cults and fertility religions was invariably the legendof the death of the hero god and the disappearance of his body. In thesubsequent search and supposed finding of the body we see the contrivance of anelaborate psychological ruse. The body was said to have been concealed by thekiller or killers of the hero god. The concealment of the body was called‘aphanism’ and is a rite of the Masonic 3rd Degree. Anyone interested incomprehending the mechanics of group mind control would do well to study the 3rdand 9th degrees in particular, and all the grades of Masonry in general. Thedisappearance of the body, this aphanism, is to be found in the assassination ofPresident Kennedy:“The President’s brain was removed and his body buried without it ... Dr. CyrilWecht, chief medical examiner of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, past presidentof the American Academy of Forensic Scientists, and a professor of pathology andlaw, received permission from the Kennedy family in 1972 to view the autopsymaterials (at the National Archives) ... When he routinely asked to see thebrain, Wecht was told it was missing, along with the microscopic slides of thebrain. Marion Johnson, curator of the Warren Commission’s material at theArchives said, “The brain’s not here. We don’t know what happened to it.”8“If and when the brain is recovered, the entire process will have been completedunder the term ‘euresis.’ In the Masonic Mysteries are ‘symbolical ladders.’ Onthe Masonic tracing board of 1776 there is a ladder with three steps, asignificant revision of the usual ladder in such references (seven steps).“There are of course all sorts of ladders: the Brahmanical Ladder (seven steps),the Kadosh Ladder (seven steps), Rosicrucian Ladder (seven steps), Jacob’sLadder (various numbers attributed), the Kabbalistic Ladder (ten steps); thenthere is old “Tim Finnegan’s Ladder” which is known to some as the ‘Ladder ofMisfortune,’ and it is seemingly comprised of one false step after another.“After the Kennedy coffin was removed from the Center of the Capitol rotundacircle, it was taken, with pageantry, to the street for viewing. The funeralprocession made an ‘unplanned stop’ on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the‘Occidental Restaurant’ and a picture was taken of the flag draped Kennedycoffin with the word ‘Occidental’ featured prominently over it. In Masonry andin the lore of the Egyptian jackal-god Anubis, a dead person is said to have‘gone west.’“Several months after the Kennedy funeral, ‘Occidental Life,’ an insurancebranch of the Transamerica Corporation, ran an advertisement for group lifeinsurance which it proclaimed to be ‘new’ but contained a turn that was indeedoriginal: the inferential weird claim was made that “Until now there was onlyone way to cash in on Group Insurance”; apparently some rather profound changeswere made in the manner of things-as-they-are after the ‘Killing of the King’had become a fait accompli.“Before JFK began his Jornada del Muerto (Journey of Death), he was photographedwith Yugoslavian dictator Tito on the winding stairs in the White House. Tito isa significant name in Masonry since it was the title given to Prince Harodim,the first Judge and Provost said to be appointed by King Solomon. The Tito was areputed favourite of Solomon, whose temple was a hotbed of thievery,money-changing, male and female prostitution and sorcery. This ancient Titopresided over the Lodge of Intendants of this temple and was one of the ‘twelveknights of the twelve tribes of Israel.’“President Kennedy preceded Tito down the stairs to a portrait of theassassinated President Garfield where he was photographed, and another picturewas taken on the stairs before a picture of Lincoln (the Lincoln Continentallimousine in which Kennedy was shot).“John F. Kennedy, the one and only Catholic president of the United States, wasa human scapegoat, a ‘pharmakos.’ ‘Pharmakos’ or ‘Pharmak-vos’ can mean“enchantment with drugs and sorcery” or “beaten, crippled or immolated.” Inalchemy, the Killing of the King was symbolised by a crucified snake on a taucross, a variant of the crucifixion of Jesus.“Jesus Christ was tortured and murdered as the result of the intrigue of the menof the Temple of Solomon who hated and feared Him. They were steeped inEgyptian, Babylonian and Phoenician mysticism.“Masonry does not believe in murdering a man in just any old way and in the JFKassassination it went to incredible lengths and took great risks in order tomake this heinous act of theirs correspond to the ancient fertility oblation ofthe Killing of the King.”Michael A. Hoffman explains that the three hoboes arrested at the time of theassassination in Dallas were at least as important symbolically as operationallyand that they comprise the ‘Three Unworthy Craftsmen’ of Masonry. “Thissymbolism is at once a telling psychological blow against the victim and hiscomrades, a sign of frustrated inquiry, the supposedly senseless nature of anyquest into the authentic nature of the murderers, and a mirror or doppelgangerof the three assassins who execute the actual murder.“‘Three Unworthy Craftsmen’ of Masonry, part of the rites of initiation for theMaster Mason, which is a third degree of masonry, are dramatic, as they “revealthe most enduring and most important mystery of all Masonic ritual: the legendof the murdered Master. After brief ceremonies, the candidate is blindfolded asthe Worshipful Master begins to tell him the story of the murder of Hiram Abiff,the master builder of Solomon’s temple. He explains that three assailants whodemanded they be told the secrets of a Master Mason attacked Abiff. After Abiffrefused to divulge the secrets, he is killed. Once King Solomon is told that theGrand Master has disappeared, Solomon orders that all the workers search for themissing Grand Master. Finally, King Solomon is told that three fellow craftsmen,Jubela, Jubelo and Jubelum are missing.”9 The three assassins are eventuallycaptured and killed on orders of King Solomon. “Thus ends the initiation of theMaster Mason, most interesting of the three degrees because it contains theunexplained allegory that gave Freemasonry its central identification with theconstruction of the Temple of Solomon.”10As for the three assassins themselves: Perry Raymond Russo told a New Orleansgrand jury that CIA agent David Ferrie said (regarding the assassination of JFK)that “there would have to be a minimum of three people involved. Two of thepersons would shoot diversionary shots and the third ... shot the good shot.”Ferrie said that one of the three would have to be the “scapegoat.” He also saidthat Ferrie discoursed on the availability of exit, saying that the sacrificedman would give the other two, time to escape.11THE WARREN COMMISSION“Mason Lyndon Johnson appointed Mason Earl Warren to investigate the death ofCatholic Kennedy. Mason and member of the 33rd degree, Gerald R. Ford, wasinstrumental in suppressing what little evidence of a conspiratorial naturereached the commission. Responsible for supplying information to the commissionwas Mason and member of the 33rd degree, J. Edgar Hoover. Former CIA directorand Mason Allen Dulles was responsible for most of his agency’s data supplied tothe panel.“Is it paranoid to be suspicious of the findings of the panel on these grounds?Would it be paranoid to suspect a panel of Nazis appointed to investigate thedeath of a Jew or to suspect a commission of Klansmen appointed to investigatethe death of a negro?“Dr. Albert Mackey, Mason, member of the 33rd degree, foremost Masonic historianof the nineteenth century, writing in the Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, definedHoodwink as ‘A symbol of the secrecy, silence and darkness in which themysteries of our art should be preserved from the unhallowed gaze of theprofane.’“That is how they see us, as ‘profane,’ as ‘cowans’ (outsiders), unclean and tooperverted to look upon their hallowed truths. Yes, murder, sexual atrocities,mind control, attacks against the people of the United States, all of thesethings are so elevated, so lofty and holy as to be beyond the view of merehumans.TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES“District Attorney for New Orleans, James Garrison, was supported by a ‘Truth orConsequences’ Club and is alleged to have been an ex-FBI agent and to have beenmentally disturbed at one time. Jim Garrison was an outsider in the SecretSociety machinations of the FBI and may very well have been pharmacologically orhypnotically induced to set up his ill-fated investigation and the position heacquired in the ‘Truth or Consequences Commission.’“Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, is a town located on the 33rd degree ofparallel latitude, and near the same latitude John Fitzgerald Kennedy became anoblation and on the same latitude is the chief Temple on this planet in theminds of sorcerers, namely the Temple of Solomon at Jerusalem, which was oncelocated there and is sworn to be rebuilt on this 33rd degree.“In a literal, alchemical sense, the Making Manifest of All That is Hidden isthe accomplishment of the 3rd Law of the Alchemists and is, as yet, unfulfilledor at least not completed; the other two have been: the creation and destructionof primordial mater (the detonation of the first Atomic Bomb at the TrinitySite, at White Sands, New Mexico, on the 33rd degree of parallel, breaking apartand joining together are the first principles of alchemy. The atomic bomb brokeapart the positive and negative (male and female) elements that composeprimordial matter, culminating untold thousands of years of alchemicalspeculation and practice), the Killing of the King (at the Trinity Site, atDealey Plaza, Dallas, near the 33rd degree of latitude).“Only the repetition of information presented in conjunction with knowledge ofthis mechanism of Making Manifest of All That is Hidden provides the sort ofboldness and will which can demonstrate that we are aware of all the enemies,all the opponents, all the tricks and gadgetry, and yet we are still notdissuaded, that we work for the truth for the sake of the truth. Let the resttake upon themselves and their children the consequences of their actions.”12The Alchemy of Ritual MurderMichael Hoffman, author of Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare, and anexpert on the Kennedy assassination explains: “What ought to be unambiguous toany student of mass psychology, is the almost immediate decline of the Americanpeople in the wake of this shocking, televised slaughter. There are manyindicators of the transformation. Within a year Americans had largely switchedfrom softer-toned, naturally coloured cotton clothing to garish-colouredartificial polyesters. Popular music became louder, faster and more cacophonous.Drugs appeared for the first time outside the Bohemian subculture ghettos, inthe mainstream. Extremes of every kind came into fashion. Revolutions incognition and behaviour were on the horizon, from the Beatles to Charles Manson,from Free Love to LSD.“The killers were not caught, the Warren Commission was a whitewash. There was asense that the men who ordered the assassination were grinning somewhere overcocktails and out of this, a nearly-psychedelic wonder seized the Americanpopulation, an awesome shiver before the realization that whoever could kill apresident of the United States in broad daylight and get away with it, could getaway with anything.“A hidden government behind the visible government of these United States becamepainfully obvious in a kind of subliminal way and lent an undercurrent of thehallucinogenic to our reality. Welcome to Oz thanks to the men behind Os-waldand Ruby.“There was a transfer of power in the collective group mind the American masses:from the public power of the elected front-man Chief Executive, to an unelectedinvisible college capable of terminating him with impunity.“For the first time in their history since the 1826 Masonic assassination ofwriter William Morgan, Americans were forced to confront the vertiginous realityof a hidden power ruling their world. Sir James Frazer writing in The GoldenBough: A Study in Magic and Religion, explains that when the “divine king” ismurdered by one who is himself stronger or craftier, those powers of “divinity”which were the king’s are “Sympathetically” and “Contagiously” transferred fromthe vanquished to the victor.“The entry of this awareness into the subconscious Group ‘Dreaming’ Mind of theAmerican masses instituted a new simulacrum. The shocking introduction of adiametrically different, new “reality” is a classic scenario of another phase ofalchemical programming known to the cryptocracy as ‘Clamores.’“Now the American people were forced to confront a scary alternative reality,the reality of a shadow government, over which they had neither control orknowledge. The shepherding process was thus accelerated with a vengeance.Avant-garde advertising, music, politics and news would hereafter depict(especially in the electronic media) -- sometimes fleetingly, sometimes openly-- a ‘shadow side’ of reality, an underground amoral ‘funhouse’ currentassociated with extreme sex, extreme violence and extreme speed.“The static images of the suit-and-tie talking heads of establishment religion,government, politics and business were subtly shown to be subordinate to theShadow State, which the American people were gradually getting a bigger glimpseof out of the corner of their collective eye. The interesting function of thisphenomenon is that it simultaneously produces both terror and adulation andundercuts any offensive against it among its percipients, which does not possessthe same jump-cut speed and funhouse ambience.“There is a sense of existing in a palace of marvels manipulated by beautifulbut Satanic princes possessed of so much knowledge, power and experience as tobe vastly superior to the rest of humanity. They have been everywhere. They havedone everything. They run the show that mesmerises us. We are determined towatch it. We are transfixed and desperate to see their newest production, theirlatest thrilling revelation, even when the thrills are solely based upon thefurther confirmation of our dehumanization.”13 As author and JFK investigatorJ.G. Ballard explains: “In this overlit realm ruled by images of the space raceand the Vietnam War, the Kennedy assassination and the suicide of MarilynMonroe, a unique alchemy of the imagination was taking place... The demise offeeling and emotion, the death of affect, presided like a morbid sun over theplayground of that ominous decade.“The role assigned to us is that of zombies called upon by our shadow masters toperform bit parts and act as stock characters in their spectacular show. Thismesmerising process produces a demoralised, cynical, double-mind.”14Double-mind, as in subliminal messages, as in mysterious synchronicities, as inoccult realm which swept through post-war events with a rapier as we looked downthe barrel of a gun, exposing the unctuous underbelly of a yet to be identifiedform. Perception changes … and we find ourselves back in the cave watchingshadows on the wall, believing them to be real.All the tradition tells us that some “experts” go the wrong way: the “brothersof the left-hand path” or “black magicians.” They use their hard-won knowledgeand insight to further their own, very personal, and often very sinister, ends.A program of propaganda, mass trauma, celebrity worship and murder …reconstituting our cultural archetypes into malleable imprints, an esoteric ridethat transcends our current slouching shadow play, nervously awaiting the nextshock.RIHANNAThe curtain is drawn and we are back in the real world. The coffin has beenremoved and the checkered floor scrubbed and polished. Lights, camera, music.So, what does a subliminal message look like? Here is one example. Robyn RihannaFenty and better known as simply Rihanna is a Barbadian born R&B recordingartist. Her 2007 album, Good Girl Gone Bad, which peaked at number two on theBillboard 200 chart, featured five top-ten hits, including three U.S. number onehit singles, amongst them “Umbrella.” She has also amassed over a billion viewson YouTube, becoming only the fourth artist to do so.15If you pay close attention to her video for “Umbrella,” you may notice somethingvery disturbing about it: A digitally mastered image that simply does not fitinto the video unless there was an ulterior reason to include it, like asubliminal message, for example. In one of the frames, Rihanna spread her arms,pushing away the rainwater falling on her. As a result, if you freeze-frame it,you can clearly see an image of a goat’s head. Or is it Baphomet’s head? Are wehallucinating? Is it trick photography? And if it isn’t, then, what’s it doingthere? Perhaps, it was an accident, a quirk of nature. Perhaps, we are makingtoo much of it. Or perhaps, not.Basic fluid dynamics will tell you that her body and arm movements can notcreate the liquid formation in the clearly visible form of goat’s head. Not onlythat, but the liquid clearly comes out from the location of Rihanna’s womb.Exaggerating? Keep in mind that music videos are created in a fully controlledstudio environment. Therefore, if something is in the music video, you can becertain that it was meant to be there.Let me give you another example. In Eminem’s “Mosh” video clip, there is animage of the Eye of Providence, an all-seeing eye that can be traced back toEgyptian mythology and the Eye of Horus. Many interpret it as the all-seeing-eyeof secret societies controlling the world from behind the scenes. It’s there,painted over an image of American soldiers, with the headline reading “CongressOKs $87 billion for Iraq.” Most people understand the Eye of Providence as theAll Seeing Eye, the symbol of Illuminati and One World Government. But it isalso the symbol of the Supreme Being, the Great Architect of the Universe,because it appears on every U.S. one-dollar bill, above a topless pyramid, aMasonic symbol for the unfinished Temple of Solomon. However, there are other,more sinister interpretations.THE CULT OF ISISThe eye of Horus formed part of an evil cult of Isis, “created as a syntheticreligion under the Ptolemaic conquerors of Egypt. The cult was created by thepriests of the Delphic cult of Apollo, who used preexisting deities of theEgyptian pantheon to construct a new religious cult based chiefly on BabylonianHellenic models. The creation of the cult of Stoicism by the same priests duringthe same Ptolemaic period represents the same ideology as the cult of Isis in asemi-religious form.“The Ptolemaic cults of Isis and the Stoic cults were the ruling pagan cults ofImperial Rome, introduced to Rome by the priests of Apollo. In creating the cultof Isis, the priests of the cult of Apollo at Delphi used the selected names ofdeities from the Egyptian pantheon to create a cult combining the Babyloniancultism of Apollo with the Orphic and Dyonisian cults of Greece. The orphic(death) cults of Greece were centered around the figure Osiris. The Egyptiangoddess Isis was given the legendary and personal properties of the mother ofDionysus, and the oedipal-incestuous mythology around the three combinedfigures, Osiris, Isis and Horus, was based on the mythology of the Phrygian cultof Dionysus,”16 or the Roman equivalent, the cult of Bacchus.There are other examples. In rapper Prodigy’s video clip, “The Life,” there is asplit second image of the ‘all-seeing-eye’ painted on the wall. What’s it doingthere and what does it have to do with the song? Nothing. In Lady Gaga’s“Alejandro” video clip, the lead male dancer had an imprint of a pyramid and anall-seeing-eye on the back of his jeans jacket, while Lady Gaga was making anall-seeing-eye sign with her right hand while bending over his outstretched leg.Not to be outdone, U2’s “Yahweh” is full of Masonic images, from theAll-Seeing-Eye on a cross to a pyramid with the Eye of Providence. In Rihanna’s“Umbrella,” she is walking on a checkered tiled Masonic floor. The Masonicmosaic pavement theme is also present in Jay Sean’s “Down” video clip.We now know that Freemasonry’s origins are linked to the once-powerful andwealthy Knights Templar order.17 The Knights Templar basis for this mosaicpavement is simple. The battle banner of the Knights, the “Beau Séant,” was avertical design consisting of a black block above a white block below. The blackblock signified the black world of sin the Templar had left behind, and thewhite block symbolizes the pure life he had adopted as a soldier for Christ.So, why do secret societies hide things in plain sight? Among many reasons,according to their belief system, to influence world politics at the most urgenttime through reverse psychology. Symbols, don’t forget, also representterritorial marks of ownership.By controlling all of the major corporations on Earth and embedding Masonic andoccult references in the media, subliminally or otherwise, secret societies areprojecting their strength. The power of the image is not only visual. It is asophisticated tool designed to convey meaning on the one hand and disorient onthe other. It is a form of psychological assault, with the number one target todestabilize the victim’s rational belief system.Given that the references make little reasonable sense to most people, we simplytend to assume that the symbols are a coincidence and reject out of hand theexistence of the occult. Needless to say Hollywood is the best tool available toproject their subliminal message across. In the movie, Angel & Demons, forexample, the Illuminati are referred to by name. Hollywood’s rendition of theIlluminati theme makes them look very evil and very … outdated, a sect of sortsfrom the bygone age, clinging on to their ancient rituals and quaint symbols,such as keys and maps. This is a clever tactic as the viewer scoffs at anyonewho mentions the Illuminati by name outside of the pre-arranged and controlledHollywood environment.Let’s take a closer look at the earlier mentioned “Rain Man” and “Umbrella.”They may be defined in the following way:Umbrella1. Collapsible canopy that protects from the rain or sun2. Object like an umbrella3. Something that gives support, protection, or authorityUmbrella in Latin also translate to “shadow” under the influence of “umbra.”18Umbra can also mean “Phantom” or “Ghost.”NECRONOMICONThe name “umbra” appears in the Necronomicon, which is a “Fictional” occult bookof demonology by H.P. Lovecraft. When the word “Rain” is used as an individual’sname, it takes on another meaning. The name “rain” means, “abundant blessingsfrom above.” By combining the different definitions of the word “rain,” we cancome up with other possible meanings:Someone who likes to make it rain (throwing a lot of money away)Someone who can give you any woman or man you desireSomeone who can make you rich and famousYou might be asking yourself if there is any physical proof of “Rain Man” inRihanna’s video? There is indeed, and your subconscious mind picked it up nearthe beginning of the video. The image in question is of Rihanna inside atriangle, bent on her knees, head bowed, body leaning forward, arms pulled backover her shoulder blades. However, several things immediately stand out aboutthis frame.First of all, it appears that Rihanna is bent over, her head bowed low, her faceagainst the floor, her legs are parted and her arms outstretched, angled behindher. The frame is dualistic in nature. It tells two stories at the same time.When you look at her hair, there are only a few strands falling towards theground. How is this possible if her head is fully bowed? Due to gravity,shouldn’t all of her hair be leaning down towards the ground?Secondly, there are anatomical impossibilities present in the image. Thedistance between Rihanna’s bowed head and shoulders is anatomicallydisproportionate. Given the relative position of her trapezius muscles andpectoralis major muscles, Rihanna’s neck would have to be eleven inches long inorder for her head to reach that low. From the position in the frame, her neckwould also have to be stretched downward at an anatomically impossible angle.But this is not all. The fact that we can simultaneously see the trapeziusmuscles and her pectoralis major muscles indicates that this frame has beendoctored, changed or digitally edited. Trapezius muscles and the pectoralismajor muscles are posterior and anterior respectively. In other words, they areopposite of each other. One existing at one’s back and the other, at one’sfront. Then, how is it possible that we are able to see both of themsimultaneously?Obviously, the image was altered, changed and adapted to show somethingdifferent. Look at the image again. Eyes, eyebrows, small forehead, snout,mouth, horns. As a result of this alteration, the image we are actually seeingis of ... a Rain Man, or the Devil.Why did we not see this in the first place? Because the frame, which creates thesubliminal stimuli, is located below an individual’s absolute threshold forconscious perception, which makes it only accessible on a subconscious level.Visual stimuli may be quickly flashed before an individual may process them, orflashed and then masked, thereby interrupting the processing. In the movieGladiator, for example, the character Maximus is taken to be killed and the word“Kennedy” flashes on the screen. At the end when Commodus stabs him, the wordappears again. But, you missed it, didn’t you. Why? Because the frame of filmwent by so quickly, the naked eye could not register it, but your subconsciousmind could have.In the end, one is left wondering whether it is possible for Hollywood and themusic industry to have been used as a tool of secret, special interests, andwhether the selection of themes, scripts, actors, studios, producers, directorswas, at times, and during certain periods of international or domestic tensions,politically motivated or the result of an intelligence agenda: a far-sightedpsychological warfare?--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 1. “Masonic Symbolism in the Assassination of JFK,” James Shelby Downard withMichael A.

Drugs had always been an ‘analytical tool’ of thenineteenth century Romantics, like the French Symbolists, and were popular amongthe European and American Bohemian fringe well into the post-World War IIperiod. But, in the second half of the 1950’s, the CIA and allied intelligenceservices began extensive experimentation with the hallucinogen LSD toinvestigate its potential for social control. It has now been documented thatmillions of doses of the chemical were produced and disseminated under the aegisof the CIA’s Operation MK-ULTRA. LSD became the drug of choice within the agencyitself, slowly making its way into academia, and from there into society atlarge.“For instance, it was OSS Research and Analysis Branch veteran Gregory Batesonwho ‘turned on’ the Beat poet Allen Ginsberg to an U.S. Navy LSD experiment inPalo Alto, California. Not only Ginsberg, but novelist Ken Kesey and theoriginal members of the Grateful Dead rock group opened the doors of perceptioncourtesy of the Navy.”1 Many young people became “Deadheads” following theGrateful Dead on tour. Veteran investigative journalist Jim Keith writes: “AnFBI internal memo from 1968 mentions the employment of the Grateful Dead as anavenue ‘to channel youth dissent and rebellion into more benign andnon-threatening directions.’ [They] performed a vital service in distractingmany young persons into drugs and mysticism, rather than politics.”2 The guru ofthe “psychedelic revolution,” Timothy Leary, “first heard about hallucinogens in1957 from Life magazine (whose publisher, Henry Luce, was often given governmentacid, like many other opinion shapers), and began his career as a CIA contractemployee; at a 1977 reunion of acid pioneers, Leary openly admitted, ‘everythingI am, I owe to the foresight of the CIA.’”3In his book, titled Understanding Understanding, Dr. Humphry Osmond wrote “theintroduction of the principal psychedelic drugs in the 1960s was a result of theCIA’s investigation into its possible military use.”4 The experiments, underdifferent code names, were conducted at more than eighty university campuses andinvoluntarily helped to popularize LSD. Thousands of university students wereused as unwitting Guinea pigs. Soon they [the students] started synthesizingtheir own acid.Beginning in 1962, the RAND Corporation National Defense Research Institute5 ofSanta Monica, California, also began a secret four-year study in experimentalpsychosis as a tool for psychiatric evaluation using LSD, peyote, and marijuana.RAND,6 an outgrowth of the wartime Strategic Bombing Survey, a ‘cost analysis’study of the psychological effects of the bombings of German population centers,is a federally-funded ‘think-tank’ sponsored by the Office of the Secretary ofDefense and the Council on Foreign Relations. The study was based on the work ofpsychiatrist W.H. McGlothlin, who conducted preparatory research on the “TheLong-Lasting Effects of LSD on Certain Attitudes in Normals: An ExperimentalProposal.”7Michael Minnicino explains this phenomenon in Fidelio Magazine’s, winter 1992issue: “Hallucinogens have the singular effect of making the victim asocial,totally self-centered, and concerned with objects. Even the most banal objectstake on the ‘aura’ which Benjamin had talked about, and become timeless anddelusionarily profound. In other words, hallucinogens instantaneously achieve astate of mind identical to that prescribed by the Frankfurt School theories.And, the popularization of these chemicals created a vast psychological labilityfor bringing those theories into practice. Thus, the situation at the beginningof the 1960’s represented a brilliant re-entry point for the Frankfurt School,and it was fully exploited. One of the crowning ironies of the ‘Now Generation’of 1964 on, is that, for all its protestations of utter modernity, none of itsideas or artefacts was less than thirty years old.“The political theory came completely from the Frankfurt School; LucienGoldmann, a French radical who was a visiting professor at Columbia Universityin 1968, was absolutely correct when he said of Herbert Marcuse in 1969 that‘the student movements ... found in his works and ultimately in his works alonethe theoretical formulation of their problems and aspirations [emphasis inoriginal].’ The long hair and sandals, the free love communes, the macrobioticfood, the liberated lifestyles, had been designed at the turn of the century,and thoroughly field-tested by various, Frankfurt School-connected New Agesocial experiments like the Ascona commune before 1920. Even Tom Hayden’sdefiant ‘Never trust anyone over thirty,’ was merely a less-urbane version ofRupert Brooke’s 1905, ‘Nobody over thirty is worth talking to.’ The socialplanners who shaped the 1960’s simply relied on already-available materials,taking the entire charade one step further, beyond sanity and into the world ofsuper-drugs to be used for behaviour modification and mind control tasking, akey that would eventually allow unfettered access to the human mind.”8To understand the roots of this charade, Jeffrey Steinberg of the ExecutiveIntelligence Review suggest that it is necessary to go back to the immediatepostwar period, “when there was a concerted effort launched, by the FrankfurtSchool and the London Tavistock Institute, to use the Marxist/Freudianperversion of psychology and other social sciences, as instruments for masssocial control and brainwashing. The two pillars of the assault on the Americanintellectual tradition were cybernetics and the drug counterculture.“Drug counterculture was precisely the weapon that the Frankfurt School andtheir fellow-travellers employed, over the next 50 years, to create a culturalparadigm shift away from the so-called ‘authoritarian’ matrix of man in theliving image of God, and the superiority of the republican form of nation-stateover all other forms of political organization. They transformed Americanculture toward an erotic, perverse matrix, associated with the present‘politically correct’ tyranny of tolerance for dehumanizing drug abuse, sexualperversion, and the glorification of violence. For the Marxist/ Freudianrevolutionaries of the Frankfurt School, the ultimate antidote to the hatedWestern Judeo-Christian civilisation was to tear that civilisation down, fromthe inside, by turning out generations of necrophiliacs.“If this statement seems harsh, consider the following. In his 1948 work on ThePhilosophy of Modern Music, Frankfurt School leader Theodor Adorno argued thatthe purpose of modern music is to literally drive the listener insane. “Hejustified this by asserting that modern society was a hotbed of evil,authoritarianism, and potential fascism, and that, only by first destroyingcivilisation, through the spread of all forms of cultural pessimism andperversity, could liberation occur. On the role of modern music, he wrote, ‘Itis not that schizophrenia is directly expressed therein; but the music imprintsupon itself an attitude similar to that of the mentally ill. The individualbrings about his own disintegration.… He imagines the fulfilment of the promisethrough magic, but nonetheless within the realm of immediate actuality.… Itsconcern is to dominate schizophrenic traits through the aesthetic consciousness.In so doing, it would hope to vindicate insanity as true health.’ Necrophilia,he added, is the ultimate expression of ‘true health’ in this sick society.“Erich Fromm, another leading Frankfurt School figure, devoted much of hisseminal 1972 work, The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness, to the analysis ofnecrophilia, which he pronounced to be the dominant trend in modern society.Fromm defined necrophilia as all forms of obsession with death and destruction,particularly those with intense sexual overtones. Ironically, his ostensible‘cure’ for this mass social perversion was the drug, rock, sex counterculture ofthe late 1960s.”9LIBERATION THROUGH DRUG ABUSEEarlier, in 1952, a proposal was issued to the Director of Central Intelligenceoutlining funding mechanisms for highly sensitive CIA research and developmentprojects that would study the use of biological and chemical materials such asLSD, in altering human behaviour. On April 13, 1953, MK-ULTRA, was establishedfor the express purpose of researching and developing chemical, biological, andradiological materials to be used in clandestine operations and capable ofcontrolling or modifying human behaviour.Again, quoting Jeffrey Steinberg, “As these monstrous notions of mass socialengineering were being presented as the ‘humanistic’ alternative to world war inthe age of the atomic and hydrogen bomb, crucial projects were being launched,that would shape the implementation of this Brave New World, and bring us,today, kicking and screaming to the world of the Aquarian Conspiracy. It isnoteworthy that one of the four directors of the Authoritarian Personalityproject, R. Nevitt Sanford, played a pivotal role in the 1950s’ and ’60s’experimentation and eventual mass usage of psychedelic drugs.”10The Authoritarian Personality project of the late 1940s, was responsible forengineered the Baby Boomer drug/rock/sex counterculture of the 1960s. “In 1965,Sanford wrote the forward to Utopiates: The Use and Users of LSD 25, which waspublished by Tavistock Publications, the publishing arm of Great Britain’spre-eminent psychological warfare agency, the Tavistock Institute. Tavistockdirected the Psychiatric Division of the British Army during World War II, anddispatched many of its top brainwashers to the United States in the immediatepostwar period, to work on the secret mind-control projects of the CIA and thePentagon, including the MK-ULTRA project, devoted to the study of LSD and otherpsychedelics. In his foreword to Utopiates, Sanford, who headed up the StanfordUniversity Institute for the Study of Human Problems, a major outpost forMK-ULTRA secret LSD experimentation.”11‘The nation,’ Sanford wrote, “‘seems to be fascinated by our 40,000 or so drugaddicts who are seen as alarmingly wayward people who must be curbed at allcosts by expensive police activity. Only an uneasy Puritanism could support thepractice of focusing on the drug addicts (rather than our 5 million alcoholics)and treating them as a police problem instead of a medical one, whilesuppressing harmless drugs such as marijuana and peyote along with the dangerousones.’”12Lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD, was developed in 1943 by Albert Hoffman, achemist at Sandoz A.B. – a Swiss pharmaceutical house owned by S.G. Warburg.LSD’s principal component is ergotamine tartrate, which Hoffman turned intosynthetic ergotamine, a powerful mind altering, and highly addictive drug.Looking deeper into the LSD history we discover that “While precisedocumentation is unavailable as to the auspices under which the LSD research wascommissioned, it can be safely assumed that British intelligence and itssubsidiary U.S. Office of Strategic Services were directly involved. AllenDulles, the director of the CIA when that agency began MK-ULTRA, was the OSSstation chief in Berne, Switzerland throughout the early Sandoz research. One ofhis OSS assistants was James Warburg, of the same Warburg family, who wasinstrumental in the 1963 founding of the Institute for Policy Studies, andworked with both Huxley and Robert Hutchins.”13All in all, there were 149 MK-ULTRA subprojects, many of them involved withresearch into behaviour modification, hypnosis, drug effects, psychotherapy,truth serums, pathogens and toxins in human tissues.For intelligence purposes, what was required of MK-ULTRA was the ability tomanipulate memory. Thus, what the Freudians call the “superego,” Peter Levendaexplains in Sinister Forces, “had to be bypassed, allowing the controller directaccess to the contents of an enemy agent’s mind. That was step one. Step twowould involve erasing specific pieces of information from the subject’s memoryand replacing those pieces with new bits of memory, thus permitting the Agencyto send that agent back into the field without any knowledge that he or she hadbeen interrogated and had given up sensitive information. Step three was apotential bonus: Could that enemy agent then ‘be programmed’ to commit acts onbehalf of the Agency, without knowing who gave the command or why? This was theessence of the Manchurian Candidate. It is also the essence of what we knowtoday as hypnotherapy and ‘depth’ psychoanalysis, for the psychiatrist islooking for access to the patient’s unconscious layers, to extract importantinformation, such as childhood trauma, and to neutralise the effects of thattrauma, in some cases replacing certain behaviour patterns with new, approvedpatterns.”14The proximate origins for these actions “go back to an overtly satanic turn inthe Nineteenth-Century Romantic movement. Notably, the exemplary connection ofBritain’s H.G. Wells, Bertrand Russell, and Theosophist leader Aleister Crowley,to the role of Aldous Huxley in the promotion of what were originally known aspsychotomimetic (“psychosis-imitating”), or psychedelic drugs. This connectionexposes the satanic quality of the work of Aldous Huxley et al. in thepreparation of what emerged as the “rock-drug-sex counterculture” of the1960s.”15Crowley and Capri resident Aksel Muenthe were the leading figures of theSatan/anti-Christ cult of Theosophy during the beginning of the 20th century.“The publication of the pro-satanic periodical, Lucifer, in Vienna, withparticipation of Crowley, is exemplary. The role of Maxim Gorky in the Grotto ofCapri, was part of the pre-World War I activity of these pro-satanic circles.The composer Richard Wagner and the existentialist Friedrich Nietzsche, were keyfigures of this anti-Christ movement. For Muenthe et al., the originalanti-Christ was the Emperor Tiberius whose son-in-law, Pontius Pilate, executedJesus Christ.”16 This was the circle into which Aldous and Julian Huxley wereintroduced, by H.G. Wells and Bertrand Russell, during the late 1920s and early1930s. “Notably, the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation of the 1940s and 1950s servedas one of the principal covens where the architects of the 1960s rock-drug-sexyouth-counterculture often met.”17MASS PSYCHOLOGY MODELThe counterculture model that the British had imposed on the United States wasbased on the pagan ceremonies of ancient Egyptian and Roman Empires. And thesehad a history of their own. The continuity of the cult of Apollo is important tothis point. There are “black nobility” families of Rome whose families andfamily political traditions trace back to the Roman republic. “The republic andempire under which their ancestors lived was in turn controlled by Rome branchof the cult of Apollo. That cult, was during that time, variously, the chiefusurious debt-farming institution of the Mediterranean region,”18 a politicalintelligence service, and both a cult and a creator of cults.From the death of Alexander the Great until the cult of Apollo dissolved itselfinto the cult of Stoicism it had created during the second century B.C., thebase of the cult was Ptolemaic Egypt, from which the cult controlled Rome. InEgypt, the cult of Apollo syncretized the cult of Isis and Osiris as the directimitation of the Phrygian cult of Dionysus and the Roman imitation, the cult ofBacchus. It was there that the cult of Stoic irrationalism was created by thecult of Apollo. It was the cult of Apollo that created the Roman Empire, whichcreated the Roman law on the basis of the antihumanistic AristoteleanNicomachean Ethics. That is the tradition which the old ‘black’ Roman familiestransmit. These roman families, over time, became known as the Venetian BlackNobility and today their members hold key positions within the inner circle oforganizations such as the Bilderberg group.That tradition persisted under various institutional covers, always preservingthe essential world-outlook and doctrine intact. The British monarchy, theparasitical aristocratic landlord class of Britain, and the British-dominated,feudalist factions of the Maltese Order, are the modern, concentrated expressionof the unbroken tradition and policies of the ancient Apollo cult.The Aristotelian knows that “generalised scientific and technological progress,given the conditions of education and liberty of innovation which progressdemands, produces in the citizen a dedication to the creative potential of thehuman mind which is antithetical to the oligarchical system.What the Aristotelians have hated and feared down through the millennia is theirknowledge that persistent, generalized scientific and technological progress, asthe dirigiste policy of society, means a republican hegemony which ends foreverthe possibility of establishing oligarchical world-rule.”19They have resorted to the same methods used by the ancient priests of Apollo –the promotion of Dionysian cults of drug-cultures, orgiastic-eroticcountercultures, deranged mobs of “machine-breakers” and terrorist maniacs – toturn such a combined force of demented rabble against those forces in societythat are dedicated to scientific and technological progress.The following description of cult ceremonies dating back to the Egyptian Isispriesthood of the third millennium B.C. could just as well be a journalisticaccount of a “hippie be-in” circa A.D. 1969: “The acts or gestures thataccompany the incantations constitute the rite (of Isis). In these dances, thebeating of drums and the rhythm of music and repetitive movements were helped byhallucinatory substances like hashish or mescal; these were consumed asadjuvants to create the trance and the hallucinations that were taken to be thevisitation of the god. The drugs were sacred, and their knowledge was limited tothe initiated.… Possibly because they have the illusion of satisfied desires,and allowed the innermost feelings to escape, these rites acquired during theirexecution a frenzied character that is conspicuous in certain spells: “Retreat!Re is piercing thy head, slashing thy face, dividing thy head, crushing it inhis hands; thy bones are shattered, thy limbs are cut to pieces!”20Firstly, Isis is a drug cult. It is a cult of high priests and secret rituals.These secret rituals have been kept inside the British Royal Family and theirruling class friends, for centuries. The Cult was practiced in Egypt during theThird Dynasty of the Old Kingdom circa 2780 B.C. Isis worship is essentiallypagan, primitive mother worship. The Isis priesthood is a closed circle and itsnobility, practiced social control, total subjugation of man’s free will,exploitation and subjugation of people. The Isis Cult was “popularised” minusits secrets, by Isis high priest Bulwer-Lytton’s work, The Last Days of Pompeii.Bulwer-Lutton’s son, Edward, was Viceroy and Governor General of India from 1876through 1880, when exports of Bengal opium to China were greatly stepped up.Bulwer-Lutton was the mentor of Lord Palmerston who led the British Parliamentduring the opium wars that forced an unwilling China to not only continue, butalso expand the sale of opium in that country. Russian occultist MadameBlavatsky further popularized the Cult of Isis through her book, Isis Unveiled.Lord Bertrand Russell, who joined with the Frankfurt School in this effort atmass social engineering for the purposes of destroying man’s creative powers aswell as wreck European and American cultures, spilled the beans in his 1951book, The Impact of Science on Society. He wrote:“Physiology and psychology afford fields for scientific technique which stillawait development. Two great men, Pavlov and Freud, have laid the foundation. Ido not accept the view that they are in any essential conflict, but whatstructure will be built on their foundations is still in doubt. I think thesubject which will be of most importance politically is mass psychology.… Itsimportance has been enormously increased by the growth of modern methods ofpropaganda. Of these the most influential is what is called ‘education.’Religion plays a part, though a diminishing one; the press, the cinema, and theradio play an increasing part.… It may be hoped that in time anybody will beable to persuade anybody of anything if he can catch the patient young and isprovided by the State with money and equipment.”Russell continued, “The subject will make great strides when it is taken up byscientists under a scientific dictatorship . . . The social psychologists of thefuture will have a number of classes of school children on whom they will trydifferent methods of producing an unshakable conviction that snow is black.Various results will soon be arrived at. First, that the influence of home isobstructive. Second, that not much can be done unless indoctrination beginsbefore the age of ten. Third, that verses set to music and repeatedly intonedare very effective. Fourth, that the opinion that snow is white must be held toshow a morbid taste for eccentricity. But I anticipate. It is for futurescientists to make these maxims precise and discover exactly how much it costsper head to make children believe that snow is black, and how much less it wouldcost to make them believe it is dark gray.”Russell concluded with a warning: “Although this science will be diligentlystudied, it will be rigidly confined to the governing class. The populace willnot be allowed to know how its convictions were generated. When the techniquehas been perfected, every government that has been in charge of education for ageneration will be able to control its subjects securely without the need ofarmies or policemen.”21The Russells, an English noble family, came into their own during the reign ofHenry VIII. Earl Bertrand Russell was the grandson of Lord John Russell(1798-1878), twice prime minister during the reign of Queen Victoria.ENTER ALDOUS HUXLEYIt was Lord Russell who proposed the development of mass drugging of populationsas method of social control, through decriminalization of marijuana and otherdangerous psychotropic drugs and the modification of the use of language toprovide methods of mass social manipulation (linguistics). The drug side of theRussell project was picked up chiefly by Aldous Huxley.Aldous Huxley was a grandson of the famous biologist, Thomas Henry Huxley, whoseoutspoken support of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution earned him thenickname, ‘Darwin’s Bulldog.’ It was Thomas Huxley, “a leading member of theMetaphysical Society, which was founded in 1869 in an attempt to forge a moreeffective intellectual elite out of the membership of the Oxford Essayists andCambridge Apostles”22 who coined the term ‘agnosticism.’ Huxley and his leadingcircles denied the ability of man to actually know anything, the so-called“no-soul” doctrine that was at the heart of Wells’ book, Open Conspiracy.Unlike his grandfather, Aldous Huxley was a novelist, who liked to experimentwith drugs to discover his inner creativity and spiritual connection. Drugs,more than evangelists, he believed, had the psychedelic power to tap into aspiritual well of visions. Even a fleeting experience of self-transcendencecould shatter society’s traditional way of thinking about religion in eachperson’s pursuit of a deeper and more meaningful spiritual life. Huxleypredicted that religion would be transformed from “an activity mainly concernedabout symbols” to “an activity mainly concerned with experience and intuition”driven by mystical inspiration.It all went back to Thomas Huxley’s basic teaching: “the unifying theme was thedenial of the nobility of man, as expressed in the provable power of the humanmind to create and discover new ideas.”23Aldous Huxley was a lifelong collaborator of Arnold Joseph Toynbee, an economichistorian whose twelve-volume analysis of the rise and fall of civilizationsexamined history from a global perspective. Huxley met Toynbee at Oxford, wherehe was tutored by H.G. Wells, who was T.H. Huxley’s protégé. While Wells went onto become the head of British Foreign Intelligence during World War I, Toynbeesat on the Royal Institute of International Affairs (RIIA) Council in ChathamHouse [interlocked with the CFR in the United States] for nearly fifty years.During World War I, he also headed the Research Division of the IntelligenceDepartment for the British Foreign Office and was a delegate to the Paris PeaceConference in 1919.24 From 1925 to 1955, he served as the Director of Studies atthe RIIA, and then during World War II, he became Prime Minister WinstonChurchill’s briefing officer.In an excellent investigative report on the Aquarian Conspiracy, ExecutiveIntelligence Review staff explain that Toynbee’s “theory” of history, “expoundedin his twenty-volume History of Western civilization, was that its determiningculture has always been the rise and decline of grand imperial dynasties. At thevery point that these dynasties – the ‘thousand year Reich’ of the Egyptianpharaohs, the Roman Empire, and the British Empire – succeed in imposing theirrule over the entire face of the earth, they tend to decline. Toynbee arguedthat this decline could be abated if the ruling oligarchy (like that of theBritish Roundtable) would devote itself to the recruitment and training of anever-expanding priesthood dedicated to the principles of imperial rule.”25Whereas Toynbee,appealed to the high-brow intellects of the British aristocracy,Wells’ science fiction stories had squarely positioned him as a ‘pop star’ ofthe time. According to Wells, world revolution was only attainable through anOpen Conspiracy: Blue Print for a World Revolution, using counterculture as abattering ram on an unsuspecting public. Wells wrote, “[it] will appear first, Ibelieve, as a conscious organization of intelligent and quite possibly in somecases, wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social and political aims,confessedly ignoring most of the existing apparatus of political control, orusing it only as an incidental implement in the stages, a mere movement of anumber of people in a certain direction who will presently discover with a sortof surprise the common object toward which they are all moving … In all sorts ofways they will be influencing and controlling the apparatus of the ostensiblegovernment.”26From his experience as one of the initiates in the “Children of the Sun,” aDionysian cult comprised of the children of Britain’s Round Table elite,27Aldous Huxley gained material to create his most famous novel, Brave New World28 published in 1931. Brave New World is a virtual blueprint of a true-life,future, one-world socialist government, or as his Fabian mentor, H.G. Wells,paraphrased the title for one of his own popular novels, The New World Order[1940], The Open Conspiracy: Blue Prints for a World Revolution [1928], openlyexamines how this New World Order could be attained, ostensibly for world peaceand human evolution.Remember, the goal of Wells, Russell, Huxley and company is the destruction ofthe sovereign power of the nation-state, and with it the elimination of aphilosophical, cultural, and religious tradition dating more than 2,500 years.So, what is it that makes an ‘open conspiracy’ open, as in placed there in plainsight for everyone to see? Larry Hecht explains: “what makes the ‘openconspiracy’ open, is not the laying out of some secret master plan, not therevealing of the membership roster of some inner sanctum of the rich andpowerful, which the typical deluded populist supposes to be the secret to powerin the world. It is, rather, the understanding that ideas, philosophy andculture, control history. What constitutes a conspiracy, for good or evil, is aset of ideas which embody a concept of what it is to be human, and a conceptionof man’s role in universal history.”29It was H.G. Wells who introduced Huxley to Satanist Aleister Crowley. Crowleywas a poster child of the occult that developed in Britain from the 1860s underthe influence of Edward Bulwer-Lytton – the colonial minister under LordPalmerston during the Second Opium War. In 1886, Crowley, William Butler Yeats,poet and Nobel Prize winner and several other Bulwer-Lytton proteges formed asatanic “Isis-Urania Temple of Hermetic Students of the Golden Dawn. This IsisCult was organized around the 1877 manuscript Isis Unveiled by Madame HelenaBlavatsky, in which the Russian occultist called for the British aristocracy toorganize itself into an Isis priesthood.”30Criton Zoakos explains that “among the other initiates in the Children of theSun were T.S. Eliot, W.H. Auden, Sir Oswald Mosley, and D.H. Lawrence, Huxley’shomosexual lover. It was Huxley, furthermore, who would launch the legal battlein the 1950s to have Lawrence’s pornographic novel Lady Chatterley’s Loverallowed into the United States on the ground that it was a misunderstood ‘workof art.’”31In Brave New World, Huxley centers on the scientific methodology for keeping allpopulations outside the elite minority in a permanently autistic-like conditionactually in love with their servitude. Speaking at the California Medical Schoolin San Francisco, Huxley announced: “There will be in the next generation or soa pharmacological method of making people love their servitude and producingdictatorship without tears, so to speak. Producing a kind of painlessconcentration camp for entire societies so that people will in fact have theirliberties taken away from them but will rather enjoy it, because they will bedistracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda, or brainwashing, orbrainwashing enhanced by pharmacological methods. And this seems to be the finalrevolution.” To Wells’ way of thinking, this wasn’t a conspiracy, but rather aone-world brain functioning as a police of the mind.In a speech on the U.S. State Department’s Voice of America, in 1961, Huxleyspoke of a world of pharmacologically manipulated slaves, living in a“concentration camp of the mind,” enhanced by propaganda and psychotropic drugs,learning to ‘love their servitude,’ and abandoning all will to resist. “This,”Huxley concluded, “is the final revolution.” Huxley’s cohort in the 1950sexperimentation with psychotropic drugs, Dr. Timothy Leary, of HarvardUniversity’s Psychology Department, “provided another glimpse into the pervertedminds of the Russell/Huxley/Frankfurt School crowd, in Flashback, hisautobiographical account of the Harvard University Psychedelic Drug Project.Leary quoted Huxley: ‘These brain drugs, mass produced in the laboratories, willbring about vast changes in society. This will happen with or without you or me.All we can do is spread the word. The obstacle to this evolution, Timothy, isthe Bible.’ Leary then added: ‘We had run up against the Judeo-Christiancommitment to one God, one religion, one reality, that has cursed Europe forcenturies and America since our founding days. Drugs that open the mind tomultiple realities inevitably lead to a polytheistic view of the universe. Wesensed that the time for a new humanist religion based on intelligence,good-natured pluralism and scientific paganism had arrived.’”32HUXLEY AT WORKIn 1954 Huxley published a study of consciousness expansion through mescaline,The Doors of Perception, the first manifesto of the psychedelic drug cult. TheDoors33 rock band borrowed their name from this psychedelic manifesto. Huxleyborrowed the title from William Blake’s poem: “If the doors of perception werecleansed / All things would appear infinite.”In 1958, Aldous Huxley assembled a number of essays that he had written forNewsday and published them collectively as Brave New World Revisited, in whichhe described a society where “the first aim of the rulers is, at all costs, tokeep their subjects from making trouble.” He described a likely future: “Thecompletely organized society … the abolition of free will by methodicalconditioning, the servitude made acceptable by regular doses of chemicallyinduced happiness…”He also predicted democracies would change their nature: “quaint old forms –elections, parliaments, Supreme Courts –will remain but the underlying substancewill be non-violent totalitarianism. Democracy and freedom will be the theme ofevery broadcast and editorial – but democracy and freedom, in a strictlyPickwickian [i.e. not literal] sense. Meanwhile, the ruling oligarchy and itshighly trained elite of soldiers, policemen, thought-manufacturers andmind-manipulators will quietly run the show as they see fit.”34How different is it from what we have today?THE ROOTS OF THE FLOWER PEOPLEBack in California, Gregory Bateson had maintained the Huxley operation out ofthe Palo Alto VA hospital. Bateson, one of the most colourful characters of theepoch, was former husband of anthropologist Margaret Mead. Bateson, himself arenowned anthropologist with the OSS, “became the director of a hallucinogenicdrug experimental clinic at the Palo Alto Veterans Administration Hospital.Under Bateson’s auspices, the initiating “cadre” of the LSD cult – the hippies –were programmed.“Through LSD experimentation on patients already hospitalized for psychologicalproblems, Bateson established a core”35 of ‘initiates’ into the ‘psychedelic’Isis Cult. Here is a bit of what Michael Minnicino in the The Campaigner’s April1974 issue had to say: “Foremost among his Palo Alto recruits was Ken Kesey. In1959, Bateson administered the first dose of LSD to Kesey. By 1962, Kesey hadcompleted a novel, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, which popularized the notionthat society is a prison and the only truly ‘free’ people are the insane.”36 Itis worth noting that during the 1960s, the Tavistock Clinic fostered the notionthat no criteria for sanity exist and that psychedelic “mind-expanding” drugsare valuable tools of psychoanalysis. Kesey subsequently organized37 a circle ofLSD initiates’ called ‘The Merry Pranksters.’”38This goofy band toured the United States spreading LSD and “establishing thepretext for a high volume of publicity on behalf of the still minuscule”39counterculture.Minnicino’s report continued: “By 1967, the Kesey cult had handed out suchquantities of LSD that a sizable drug population “flower children” had emerged,centred in the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. Here Huxleycollaborator Bateson set up a ‘free clinic,’ staffed by Dr. David Smith, later a‘medical adviser’ for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws(NORML) and Dr. Peter Bourne, formerly President Carter’s special assistant ondrug abuse.”PAGAN CONNECTIONYet, it was not until the Vietnam War and the “anti-war” movement that reallycreated the climate of moral despair and rot that spurred America’s youth torely on drugs. In other words, the war was used as a backdrop against which tocreate the anti-war movement. Their disillusionment with the war made theprotesters easy prey for their masters to condition them under the guidance ofthe Tavistock Institute and the CIA through the influence of the LSD drugculture.I am not suggesting that most anti-war protesters were paid agents for the elitecircles. On the contrary, as Criton Zoakos suggests, “the overwhelming majorityof anti-war protesters went into the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)organization on the basis of outrage at the developments in Vietnam. But oncecaught in the environment defined by the Tavistock Institute’s psychologicalwarfare experts, and inundated with the message that hedonistic pleasure-seekingwas a legitimate alternative to ‘immoral war,’ the protesters’ sense of valuesand their creative potential went up in a cloud of hashish smoke.“The outcome of this debacle was a major strategic withdrawal from Asia by theUnited States, spelled out in Henry Kissinger’s ‘Guam Doctrine,’ adoption of thespectacular failure known as the ‘China Card’ strategy for containing Sovietinfluence, and demoralization of the American people over the war to the pointthat the sense of national pride and confidence in the future progress of therepublic was badly damaged. ”40That moral despair is what the Frankfurt School had hoped for back when theywere looking for new cultural forms to increase the alienation of thepopulation. They found it in the newly created Rockefeller-Tavistock sponsoredand financed organization, IPS, Institute for Policy Studies.INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIESEstablished in 1963, IPS was run by President Kennedy’s National SecurityAdvisor and former President of Ford Foundation, McGeorge Bundy, one of thearchitects of U.S. policy toward Vietnam, particularly the notorious StrategicHamlet programs and the murderous Operation Phoenix program in the Mekong Deltaregion.IPS’s main assignment was to control and co-ordinate a wide array ofpseudo-organizations, from local community control and black nationalist groupsto anti-technology organizations, anti-war movement and terrorist operationssuch as the Weathermen, especially under the auspices of the anti-war movement,to zero growth and environmentalist freak shows – “operations of the sort whichwere pioneered by British intelligence agencies, which place major emphasis uponthe use of private institutions whose overall activity is inextricably linked toofficial government institutions.”41 In short, the entirety of what became knownin the 1960s as the ‘New Left Movement.’ In their well-laid-out deconstructionof Georgii Arbatov’s book, The War of Ideas in Contemporary InternationalRelations, the investigative team of EIR writes, “The FBI and sections of theCIA have provided the controllers and deployment managers of the ‘New Left.’ IPShas provided the ‘cover stories’ and the ‘ideological management.’”42Chief theoretician for the IPS was none other than Noam Chomsky, one of thefounders of the New Left. For Chomsky, the primary purpose for creating the NewLeft of the early 1960s was to pre-empt the radicalization of college youthstrata to two overlapping ends. Immediately, the purpose was to prevent theestablished socialist parties from effectively capturing the social ferment,which had erupted beginning in 1958, “which had come to focus around the CubanRevolution and Civil Rights movement up through mid-1961. At the same time, withsuch enterprises as the Peace Corps, Office of Economic Opportunity andfoundation-sponsored community action projects for radicals in development atthat time, to drain off student radicalism into staffing of an expandingcounterinsurgency apparatus around the Reesian fascist conception of localcommunity control.”43In an exclusive report on the Institutte for Policy Studies, the investigativeteam from Executive Intelliegence Review points out that “It is important tonote that these operations are the outcome of political intelligence operationsset up prior to World War I under the auspices of the National Civic Federationand the Russell Sage Foundation and which were officially institutionalizedfollowing World War II under the aegis of the CIA.”44The Institute for Policy Studies lists, among its lecturers and fellows, membersof the Weathermen group: a U.S. radical-left organization consisting ofsplintered-off members and leaders of the Students for a Democratic Society. Inanti-war activities, IPS members carried out a series of militant actions,including bombings and violent protests to achieve the overthrow of the U.S.Government. This group was also part of the counter-counterculture controlledfrom within by the U.S. Government.The Cambridge Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Transnational Institutein Amsterdam, Holland, and related organizations “such as the group of so-calledex-CIA and military intelligence personnel around CounterSpy promote suchpolicies to seed the political climate with the idea that many of these actuallycovert operations are really expressions of popular political will. With thehelp of the mass media and selected newspapers, many of the operations were madeto appear as legitimate expressions of a political point of view.” 45FUNDING OF IPS AND RELATED INSTITUTIONSThe foundations that provide the money to maintain the illegal activities of theInstitute can be divided into two basic categories. First, top level foundationsall linked to the Rockefeller family such as the Rockefeller Family Fund,Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Ford Foundation, serve as organizations that disbursefunds for the specific operations. What these ‘specific operations’ are, wereally do not know, as the official reports never identify their purpose;instead a ‘cover’ organization or activity is used to facilitate thedisbursement of funds. On the second level, foundations, such as the Kaplan Fundand Stern Fund, serve as conduits for political and covert functions.The Case of Marcus RaskinThe key individual involved with IPS was Marcus Raskin, intimately linked to thetop levels of Rockefeller’s political intelligence machine. Raskin’s earliertraining came at the University of Chicago Law School, a political factory forRockefeller agents and operatives.By the mid-1960s, Rockefeller and the founders of the Institute for PolicyStudies, Hans Morgenthau, a Rockefeller man and one of the founding fathers ofthe “realist school” of the 20th century and McGeorge Bundy, began to establisha cover for running anarchist-leftist operations via the co-opting andinfluencing of a vast international network of operatives for ‘blackoperations.’ This was done through the National Security Council’s secret unitknown as “Special Staff” that plan and coordinate the psycho-politicaloperations used to manipulate the American public, and through a vastintergovernmental undercover infrastructure that include the legislative,executive and judicial branches of government, such as the Secretary of State,the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of theCIA; those who control television, radio, and newspaper corporations; who headthe largest law firms; who run the largest and most prestigious universities andthink-tanks; who direct the largest private foundations and who direct thelargest public corporations. Within the Special Staff, Raskin became one of theoverseers of special covert operations and destabilization scenario planning – aunique experience in creating and developing terror.NSC Special Staff, on the one hand, was a part of strategic psycho-politicaloperations that focus propaganda at small groups of people, such as academics orexperts, capable of influencing public opinion and on the other, a part oftactical psycho-political operations that focus propaganda at the masses throughmass-communication media.A vital part of the operation was the creation of the umbrella of the studentanti-war movement, Students for a Democratic Society in the U.S. With the helpof the leading U.S. figures in the social democratic “Second International,”such as Michael Harrington and UAW leaderss Victor and Walter Reuther. The SDS,created by the League for Industrial Democracy, became the flagship “syntheticnew left” organization for spinning off phony ‘leftist’ operationsinternationally. In turn, the League of Industrial Democracy was financed andrun by the Institute for Policy Studies. “Through a process of splitting andthen regrouping such organizations, a selection procedure was established forcreating terrorist organizations. Raskin supervised this operation starting in1963 and including the period when the Weathermen and other terroristorganizations were set up.”46As a co-director of IPS, Raskin initiated a series of projects designed for theprofiling and eventual deployment of the various re-groupments of SDS and leftgroups internationally. “He supervised the Radical Education Project, created inpart by the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, the U.S.’sleading ‘conflict resolution’ think-tank.”47 Raskin had also been thoroughlytrained in psychological profiling through the National Training Laboratories, aproject set up for the Rockefellers by the German fascist psychologist KurtLewin. NTL specializes in brainwashing through various methods, “includingtransactional analysis and therapy and group therapy, as well as harderbrainwashing methods, all employed to create the social basis for runningterrorist operations.”48For example, the “second generation of the Baader-Meinhof gang came from thegraduates of the Heidelberg Patients’ Collective, an experimental program usingmental patients, in which the patients were indoctrinated according to R.D.Laing-Tavistock schizophrenia-reenforcing program and also, as part of theprogram, assigned to develop the capability to produce bombs.”49It was the same technique used by Francesca Alberoni, the University of Trento’sSchool of Sociology head, to create Italy’s “leftist” terrorist organization theRed Brigades. The Trento program was a social-work brainwashing program. Thesame modus operandi was used to create the Weathermen Underground as a terroristgroup.“Not only was there irrationalist anarchist indoctrination, largely under theguidance of IPS, but ‘sensitivity sessions,’ degraded sexual practices, andemphasis on the use of LSD and other drugs were dominant features of theconditioning process. The rock-drug counterculture, including sexually andotherwise degraded communal living conditions, is the general rule among thestrata from which terrorists are recruited.”50This is the true base of the “radical youth idealism” of the 1960s, known as thecounterculture movement, that spawned the Weathermen and every extreme left-wingorganization in the United States. Under the auspices of Tavistock Institute andthe assorted support structure, such as IPS, the indoctrination terroristprogram functioned in the following manner:The intake process began with a leftist-environmentalist profiling andrecruitment under the auspices of Amnesty International. It would last severalweeks, with drugs and wife swapping, apart from “leaderless group” approaches todeeper political indoctrination. The second principal stage involved amonths-long period, augmented with drug use and sexual degradation.The third stage was Longo Mai itself where would-be terrorists and“revolutionaries” would receive basic training in weapons, with instructionsgiven by ex-Legionnaires and professional terrorists. Thus, the“environmentalist” communalism of Longo Mai, made famous by the “generation of68” was only a cover for terrorist ‘basic training’ conditioning andpreparation.“The next stage is intake into a terrorist group, with further training atanother camp anywhere in the Mediterranean region, including Israel. It shouldbe noted that this intake-process for screening of potential terrorist recruitsis identical with the development of the hard-core of the environmentalistmovement. The terrorists are distilled from the environmentalists, Maoistmovements or recruited from among prison inmate, largely through eitherin-prison ‘therapy’ programs or through ‘half-way house’ programs. A convictwith a pre-established propensity for crimes of violence and a potentialpsychosis is the most easily deployed, expendable sort of recruit to terroristand related operations.“Neither the terrorist nor the typical terrorist support group in any waycorresponds to the ‘myth of the idealist’ misled into excesses in one way oranother. But, apart from the fully conscious controllers among them, arecriminalized psychotics or semipsychotics, either selected because of thosepreexisting qualities, or because various phases of conditioning bring aboutthese states.”51According to Tavistock profiling of the terrorists, “the individual is able toperform functions involving his immediate person and environment. He canfunction. Where his psychosis shows most clearly is in his inability to copesanely with abstractions concerning the world in general. In other words, helives at best within a very small world, a world defined by a very short span ofsocial distance surrounding his or her person.”52 Tavistock controllers thendelve deeper, giving a remarkable insight into the control mechanisms of thesubject. He functions within a scope of a “surrogate family,” more or less as adisturbed but functionally effective two-to-four year old might – to be moreexact, an adolescent or adult parody of such a two-to-four year old condition.The world outside his or her “family” is not real. His or her outer worldbehavior is biased toward the schizophrenic-symbolic, rather than the real. Hissense of that world of symbols is magical, not cause-and-effect. He or shecarries the infantile superstition of the believer in astrology toward anextreme.Now, if such a person once agreed that “bad” people ought to die, “so they can´thurt good people,” and if a “person is also dedicated to killing the ‘bad’people himself, it suffices – to make the point short – to insert a face, a nameand so forth in place of the symbol ‘bad,’ and say ‘we must kill that badperson,’ and there you have the gist of it.”53That’s where the controlled media comes into play. The key to aiding thesezombied terrorists’ deployment into action are certain “code phrases.” Forexample, the code phrase used in organizing the Baader-Meinhof assassination ofDresden Bank’s Jurgen Ponto in 1977 was the epithet “Nazi Communist.”How would such a label be used by the controllers to motivate a would-beterrorist to kill his intended target? “If one knows the doctrine of WinstonChurchill, Hugh Trevor-Roper, and John Wheeler-Bennett, the doctrine they setforth in defending their preference for Adolf Hitler to the insurgent Germangenerals of 1938 and during the war, one knows that the British not only have aspecial hatred for German industrialists and the old Catholic Center Party ofGermany, but that the British, who created Hitler, saw fit to accomplish twoobjectives with one argument, the argument that Nazism was a product of Germanindustry.“Although the myth that German industrialism created Hitler is in widecirculation, the myth has strong primary emotional significance only in twoprimary circles: British intelligence circles and a certain section of Zionistcircles. In Zionist circles it serves as a reaction-formation in respect toWarburg backing of Hjalmar Schacht, and of Schacht’s placing Hitler in theChancellery, and of various Rothschild, Oppenheimer and other involvement insupporting Hitler before and after 1933 into the 1936-1938 period.“This emotionally laden identification of German industrialism as beingaxiomatically ‘Nazism’ spills over from British intelligence and certain Zionistcircles into elements of the anarchist-environmentalist ultra-left, especiallyto those layers surrounding and including ‘left’ terrorist gangs . In thesecircles, ‘Nazi’ means essentially ‘German industrialism,’ and is extendable toany pro-industrial, pro-technological-progress personality of influence orpolitical current which is viewed as ‘practically the same thing as Germanindustrialist.’”54To leave no confusion concerning the significance of Zionism in this case, aninterpolated clarification respecting the command-structure coordinatinginternational terrorist operations should be made now. The key elementscontrolling international terrorism include the “fascist international,”coordinated by the “Eastern European branch of the Maltese Order, the SovereignOrder of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem. They also include British RoundTable and official intelligence organizations. They also include elements of theSocialist International and elements of international Zionism.”55CREATING THE COUNTERCULTUREThe undeclared cultural war against America’s youth began in earnest in 1967,when Tavistock began using open-air rock concerts to attract over four-millionyoung people to the so-called “festivals.” Unbeknownst, the youth became thevictims of planned, wide-scale drug experimentation.56 Hallucinogenic drugs suchas dimethoxyphenylethylamine (STP), phencyclidine (PCP), dextromethorphan,methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and theBeatles-promoted LSD57 and Blue Micro Dot LSD-25 were freely distributed atthese concerts. Before long, over 50 million of these attendees between the ages10 to 25 years old returned home to become the messengers and promoters of thenew drug culture, or what came to be called the “New Age.”Hallucinogenic drugs are psychomimetic, meaning that they mimic certain aspectsof psychosis. Through the use of hallucinogenic drugs, one can induce temporarysymptoms of psychosis and schizophrenia. Most users of hallucinogenic drugs atthe time experienced whole personality changes causing total alterations of thesenses.58The intention of the LSD drug scene and the controlled environment itrepresented wasn’t accidental, but completely intentional. The TavistockInstitute had extensively studied the relationship between brain and behaviourcaused by hallucinogenic drugs. “Later on, the knowledge gleaned from theresearch was channelled into marketing MTV and radio stations through ‘classicoldies’ songs from 15 to 25 years ago, which are targeted at the adultpopulation.”59Several Tavistock studies showed that a song or piece of music associated withone’s childhood, when heard later in life, could call forth memories andassociations of that earlier period. Encoded memories of popular music in thelistener were recalled when he or she heard the same piece of music. Thesememories triggered an emotional drug flashback that set off an infantileemotional state that brought the listener back to that time, in which he or sheexperienced either an identical or one mirroring the drug reaction itself.60MONTEREY POPThe first commercial American rock festival, officially dubbed “The First AnnualMonterey International Pop Festival,” was held in June 1967, two years beforeWoodstock, when over 200,000 young people gathered in and around the MontereyCounty Fairgrounds in Northern California for a three-day celebration. MontereyPop 1967 was the general rehearsal for the widespread distribution of a new typeof drugs, classified as psychedelics or hallucinogens, such as LSD, which wereto become prominent and wide-spread at later outdoor festivals like Woodstock.Author Robert Santelli, in his book, Aquarius Rising, writes: “LSD was inabundance at Monterey. Tabs of ‘Monterey Purple’ [LSD-type substance also calledPurple Haze] were literally given to anyone wishing to experiment a little.” Thetwo characters responsible for its distribution at Monterey Pop were a mysteryman from Coco Beach Florida called Peter Goodrich and the legendary CIA contractagent code-named “Coyote.”One of the organizers of the Monterey festival was John Phillips, a member ofthe Mamas and the Papas rock group61 and former press agent for the Beatles.Phillips was closely linked with Roman Polanski and his wife Sharon Tate, MamaCass [lead singer of the Mamas and the Papas], Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boysand many other Hollywood celebrities who in turn were linked with CharlesManson’s Family[82]. Manson Family members stabbed to death aneight-months-pregnant actress Sharon Tate on August 9, 1969 at her home in LosAngeles.Mama Cass and John Phillips were connected to Manson through “The Process Churchof the Final Judgment,” an offshoot of the Church of Scientology founded inEngland in the mid-60s by a couple of former Scientologists, Robert and Mary AnnDeGrimston. Formed sometime in 1963-64, PCFJ was a mixture of reincarnation,existentialism, an attempt to merge the worships of Jehova and Lucifer, and abit of neo-Nazi flavour. It is significant that “The Process’s” legal work washandled by an elite Wall Street law firm, Morris and McVeigh, whose main backerwas the American Family Foundation who used intelligence-connected‘mind-control’ experts such as LSD researcher Dr. Louis Jolyon West toorchestrate ‘cult-anti-cult’ hysteria. Dr. West was a major participant in theCIA’s MK-ULTRA, which came out of the Tavistock Institute’s studies of Nazisocial control techniques.People with only passing knowledge of the Manson case usually don’t realize that“the Beach Boys recorded one of Manson’s songs and released it as the ‘B’ sideof their cover of the old Ersel Hickey 1958 hit “Bluebirds Over the Mountain’” asong about lost love.”62 The title of the song was suggestive of the CIA mindcontrol operation. Bluebird was a program for exploring the uses of hypnosis andother means to protect the recently created CIA and its personnel from enemypsychic penetration – BLUEBIRD. Is there a reason Manson’s song was on theflipside of the “Bluebird” cover? Had the CIA’s “bluebird” escaped? Was Manson a“bluebird,” i.e., a mind-control subject, gone amok?As Peter Levenda explains in Sinister Forces, “The ‘land of memory,’ was thetarget of the Bluebird project: to enter that ‘land’ in another person’s mind,to go through the drawers, re-aranging the furniture, and leave unnoticed.Korean War was fought to a stalemate.”63 Vietnam was raging all around us.Africa was ablaze with ‘godless communists’ holding the upper hand. In America,the year 1968 was the pivotal year in the lives of most people of thegeneration. It was a time of multiple assassinations, civil unrest, the riots atthe Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and the election of Richard Nixonas President. For many, it signalled the death of a dream. For some the rebirthof a nightmare. It was the year when those things that are now so secret, soclassified and behind the scenes were up front and in your face: the Cold War,the CIA, Prague Spring.It was the year that Frankfurt School, Tavistock Institute, Institute for PolicyStudies and other like-minded organizations went to war against America. It wasthe year of Woodstock and the Age of Aquarius and the death of all that we helddear. It wasn´t only “flowers in their hair” that they got; they also gotscrambled brains and total dependency on narcotics, a shortened lifespan, adegraded life-style which tended to sink lower and lower into the mire.THE AGE OF AQUARIUS: WOODSTOCK MUSIC FESTIVALThe largest concert of all time, the open-air ‘Woodstock Music and Art Fair,’64was what Time magazine labelled an ‘Aquarian Festival’ and ‘history’s largesthappening.’ In the process, Woodstock became part of the cultural lexicon.Publicists carefully chose the term, ‘Aquarian.’According to astronomers, the Ages progress in retrograde motion, going in theopposite direction as the sun, which moves from the Age of Aquarius into the Ageof Pisces into the Age of Aries, and so forth. If you follow astrologicalbeliefs, the Age of Pisces, (an artefact of the Precession of the Equinoxes) isthe time span from about 200 B.C. until the current day. Approximately every2,160 years, the Precession of the Equinoxes appears to rotate the springequinox from one constellation to another. We appear to be ending the Age ofPisces and beginning the Age of Aquarius. Moving into the Aquarian age signifiesthat the Age of Pisces, which is the age of Christ, has come to an end.65“At Woodstock,” writes journalist Donald Phau, “nearly half a million youthgathered to be drugged and brainwashed on a farm. The victims were isolated,immersed in filth, pumped with psychedelic drugs, and kept awake continuouslyfor three straight days, and all with the full complicity of the FBI andgovernment officials.”Once again, it was the networks of British Military Intelligence and the CIA,who were the initiators.A man credited with Woodstock’s creation was Artie Kornfeld, the director ofCapitol Records, which is owned by EMI. EMI, led by aristocrat Sir JosephLockwood, stands for Electrical Music Industries, and unknown to most, is one ofBritain’s largest producers of military electronics and a key member ofBritain’s military intelligence establishment as a military contractor to theBritish War Office. Furthermore, EMI’s silent partner is another major recordlabel, RCA, which is also active in military and space electronics and satellitecommunications. It is a classic example of what President Dwight Eisenhowerwould have called the “military industrial complex,” but is really the One WorldGovernment solidifying everything into fewer and fewer hands. 66The money for Woodstock was supplied by John Roberts, the heir of the largePennsylvania-based Block Drugs pharmaceutical empire and toothpastemanufacturing fortune. Joel Rosenmann, one of the three partners, writes: “Asthe concert neared, food and water were clearly going to be in short supply,sanitary facilities overtaxed, tempers short, drugs overabundant. Worst of all,there was no way for anyone who wanted to, to leave.”67According to John Roberts, sitting in your own excrement was part of theoriginal plan. “We’re going to hand out bananas at the gate to bind ourpatrons.”Security for the concert was provided by a hippie commune called the Hog Farmtrained in the mass distribution of LSD. The Hog Farm’s connection to drugdistribution, however, was well known to concert organizers. John Roberts,Woodstock founder and director writes: “Their fee was simply transportation toand from the festival … a peace-keeping force that looked, talked, and smelledlike the crowd would be both highly credible and highly effective... and mostimportant, they were wise in the ways of drugs, knowing good acid from bad, goodtrips from bummers, good medicine from poison, etc.”68But, the famed undercover hippie commune, Hog Farm, was none other than the WestCoast psychedelic group called the “Merry Pranksters,” whose leader was noneother than Ken Kesey – the same Kesey who wove his experiences as a volunteer inmedical experiments into his book, One Flew over the Cockoo’s Nest.THE EXPERIMENT BEGINSDonald Phau, in his book the Satanic Roots of Rock, describes the event: “Twodays before the scheduled start of the concert, 50,000 kids had already arrivedin Woodstock. Drugs immediately began to circulate.” Phau, in the same book,continues: “For the next three days, the nearly half a million young people thatarrived were subjected to continual drugs and rock music. Because of torrentialrains, they were forced to wallow in knee-deep mud. There were no shelters, andno way to get out. Cars were parked over eight miles away.”Rosenmann writes that the key to the ‘Woodstock experiment’ was “keeping ourperformers performing around the clock...to keep the kids transfixed…” On August17, the New York Times reported: “Tonight, a festival announcer warned from thestage, that ‘badly manufactured acid’ [a term for LSD] was being circulated. Hesaid: ‘You aren’t taking poison acid. The acid’s not poison. It’s just badlymanufactured acid. You are not going to die.... So if you think you’ve takenpoison, you haven’t. But if you’re worried, just take half a tablet.’” Theadvice, to nearly 500,000 people, “just take half a tablet” was given by noneother than MK-ULTRA agent Wavy Gravy.”It would be another decade before the counterculture became part of the Americanlexicon. But the first seeds of what was a giant, secret project to turn thevalues of America inside out were sown. Drugs, sex, rock and roll, massivenation-wide demonstrations, hippies, communes, drop-out drug heads, the Nixonpresidency, the Vietnam War were tearing the fiber of American society apart.The old world and the new collided head on, unbeknownst to the “flower children”that it was all part of a secret, social and occult agenda69 designed by some ofthe most brilliant and diabolical minds in the world. Hidden away in prestigiousfoundations, corporations and think-tanks, these political and financialpuppeteers ruthlessly and cunningly used pop culture to foster alienation anddysfunction to achieve arrested development and family breakdown for personalgain.Through 1965-1969, the psychedelic movement gained much momentum and culminatedwith events like Woodstock. However, quick as it came, it was gone. LSD wasoutlawed. Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin died. Timothy Leary dropped off hissoap-box, and the United States, after failing miserably in Vietnam, driftedinto a depressing 1970s. Yet once again, Tavistock was waiting, ready to exploitthat apathy for their personal gain.THE AQUARIAN CONSPIRACYIn the spring of 1980, a book exploded on the scene called The AquarianConspiracy. It sold over one million copies and was translated into 10languages. Overnight, it became a manifesto of the counterculture. Defining thecounterculture as a cultural group whose values and norms are at odds with thoseof the social mainstream, and in practical terms as the youth rebellion thatswept North America and Western Europe in the 1960s and early 1970s, TheAquarian Conspiracy declared that it is “now time for the 15 million Americansinvolved in the counterculture to join in bringing about a radical change in theUnited States.”70In fact, this book was the first mass publication to promote teamwork, a concepthailed as a paragon of virtue and readily promoted by business management“gurus.” Teamwork, however, was a psychological technique the TavistockInstitute introduced as a way to control brilliant individuals through peerpressure. It was part of the experiment conducted by Brigadier-General andTavistock master John Rees in the field of group therapy. L. Marcus, writing forThe Campaigner magazine in April 1974, explains: “A skilled group leader can usethe group to create a powerful ‘family’ environment. Once this environment isinduced, it becomes possible for the therapist to manipulate a member of thegroup, not by a direct attack, but by subtly manipulating through suggestionsthe other members of the group. If the victim has been sucked into thinking ofthe group as something warm and helpful, then, when that environment has beenmanipulated to turn against him, it will tend to have the impact of deepmotherly rejection. Furthermore, if the victim is not completely aware of thetherapist’s chain of manipulation, he will tend to internalize their result,thinking that he himself is responsible for this new awareness about himself.”Marcus goes on to say: “…If the controllers can succeed in structuring astressed individual’s or group’s situation appropriately, the victim(s) can beinduced to develop for himself a special sort of ‘reaction formation’ throughwhich he ‘democratically’ arrives precisely at the attitudes and decisions thedictators wish to force upon him.”So, how did author Marilyn Ferguson see the entire Aquarian movement? “Whileoutlining a not-yet-titled book about the emerging social alternatives, Ithought again about the peculiar form of this movement: its atypical leadership,the patient intensity of its adherents, their unlikely successes. It suddenlystruck me that in their sharing of strategies, their linkage, and theirrecognition of each other by subtle signals, the participants were not merelycooperating with one another. They were in collusion. It – this movement – is aconspiracy!”71In fact, the counterculture revolution was a cleverly concealed conspiracy fromthe top down, created as a method of social control through the use ofdifficult-to-identify, silent-weapons technology and “used to drain the UnitedStates of its commitment to scientific and technological progress.”72Initially, The Aquarian Conspiracy was a secret U.S. government project assignedto Stanford Research Institute(SRI) and created in 1946 by the TavistockInstitute to study how newly created cultural and social trends affect societysuch as libertarianism, left-libertarianism, liberalism, socialism, anarchism,communism, materialism, naturism, mysticism, hedonism, spirituality,environmentalism, feminism, New Age and many other basic orientations onsociety.Never publicly released and secretly named, The Changing Images of Man,73 TheAquarian Conspiracy sprang from a Policy Report prepared by the StanfordResearch Institute Center for the study of Social Policy.74 The 319 pagemimeographed report was prepared by a team of fourteen researchers and directedby a panel of 23 controllers including Margaret Mead, B.F.Skinner, Ervin Laszloof the United Nations, Sir Geoffrey Vickers of British Intelligence. The entireproject was overseen by Professor Willis Harmon, a “futurist” whose specialitywas promoting a post-industrial social paradigm as a popular version of how totransform or “soften up,” according to Tavistock manuals, the United States intoAldous Huxley’s Brave New World.In a 1961 lecture, Aldous Huxley had described this police state as “the finalrevolution” – a “dictatorship without tears,” where people “love theirservitude.” He said the goal was to produce “a kind of painless concentrationcamp for entire societies so that people will, in fact, have their libertiestaken away … but … will be distracted from any desire to rebel by propaganda orbrainwashing ... enhanced by pharmacological methods.”The aim of the Stanford study, state the authors, is to change the desire ofmankind from that of industrial progress to one that embraces “spiritualism.”[War by non-violent or non-linear confrontation] “The study asserts that, in ourpresent society, the ‘image of industrial and technological man’ is obsolete andmust be ‘discarded.’“Many of our present images appear to have become dangerously obsolete, however… science, technology, and economics have made possible really significantstrides toward achieving such basic human goals as physical safety and security,material comfort and better health. But many of these successes have broughtwith them problems of being too successful – problems that seem insoluble withinthe set of societal value-premises that led to their emergence … Our highlydeveloped system of technology leads to higher vulnerability and breakdowns.Indeed the range and interconnected impact of societal problems that are nowemerging pose a serious threat to our civilization … If our predictions of thefuture prove correct, we can expect the association problems of the trend tobecome more serious, more universal and to occur more rapidly.”75Therefore, the SRI study concludes, “we must change the industrial-technologicalimage of man fast: Analysis of the nature of contemporary societal problemsleads to the conclusion that . . . the images of man that dominated the last twocenturies will be inadequate for the post-industrial era.”76The report concludes with the following set of predictions: “There are numerousindications that a new, anticipatory image of mankind may be emerging. 1. Youth involvement in political processes 2. Women’s liberation movement 3. Youth rebellion against societal wrongs 4. Emerging interest in social responsibility of business 5. The generation gap implying a changing paradigm 6. The anti-technological bias of many young people 7. Experimentation with new family structures and interpersonal relationships 8. The emergence of communes as alternative lifestyle 9. The emergence of conservative/ecology movement 10. A surge in interest in Eastern religious and philosophical perspectives 11. A renewed interest in ‘Fundamentalist’ Christianity 12. Labor union concerns with quality of the work environment 13. An increasing interest in meditation and other spiritual disciplines 14. The increasing importance of ‘self-realization’ processThese disparate trends do not, when taken individually, signify the emergence ofa new image of a human being; yet when they are considered collectively, theysuggest substantial societal stirrings which may eventually emerge into a newand guiding image.”77This was published in 1974. In retrospect, how many of these hideous, inhumanforms have become accepted by the mainstream? Each and every one of them.Investigative journalist Criton Zoakos called it “countercultural zombiizm.”78“Thus softened up,” the United States “was now deemed ripe for the introductionof drugs [especially cocaine, crack cocaine, heroin] to rival the prohibitionera in scope and the huge amounts of money to be made. This too was an integralpart of the Aquarian Conspiracy. The proliferation of drug usage was one of thesubjects under study at the Science Policy Research Unit [SPRU] at the TavistockInstitute’s Sussex University facility. It was known as the ‘future shocks’Center, a title given to so-called future oriented psychology designed tomanipulate whole population groups to induce ‘future shocks.’”79The Columbus Center at the University of Sussex is a Tavistock-frontorganization. The Center is involved only in one line of work: it publishes‘Studies in the Dynamics of Persecution and Extermination.’ In other words, “theUnited States were to be programmed to change and become so accustomed to suchplanned changes that it would hardly be noticeable when profound changes didoccur.”80In fact, this far-reaching initiative for silent-weapon technology was firstdiscussed and put into action as an official doctrine by the Policy Committee ofthe Bilderberg Group at their inaugural meeting in 1954. Then they used the term‘Quiet War’ [WWIII] to describe the overt tactical methodology to subjugate theHuman race. The document, titled TOP SECRET: Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, Anintroductory Programming Manual, was uncovered quite by accident on July 7th,1986, when an employee of the Boeing Aircraft Co. purchased a surplus IBM copierfor scrap parts at a sale and discovered inside details of a plan, hatched inthe embryonic days of the ‘Cold War.’ This manual of strategies called forcontrol of the masses through manipulation of industry, peoples’ pastimes,education and political leanings. It called for a quiet revolution, pittingbrother against brother, to divert the public’s attention from what is reallygoing on.Here is a partial quote from this document (TM-SW7905.1): “It is patentlyimpossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of a society, i.e.,the engineering of social automation systems (silent weapons) on a national orworldwide scale without implying extensive objectives of social control anddestruction of human life, i.e., slavery and genocide. This manual is in itselfan analog declaration of intent. Such writing must be secured from publicscrutiny. Otherwise, it might be recognized as a technically formal declarationof domestic war. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in aposition of great power and without full knowledge and consent of the public,uses such knowledge and methodology for economic conquest – it must beunderstood that a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or groupof persons and the public. The solution of today’s problems requires anapproach, which is ruthlessly candid, with no agonizing over religious, moral orcultural values. You have qualified for this project because of your ability tolook at human society with cold objectivity, and yet analyze and discuss yourobservations and conclusions with others of similar intellectual capacitywithout a loss of discretion or humility. Such virtues are exercised in your ownbest interest. Do not deviate from them.”As a side note, substantial chunks of the 3,000 pages of “recommendations” givento the newly-elected Ronald Reagan administration in January 1981 were basedupon material taken from Willis Harmon’s Changing Images Of Man.During the full moon, on December 8, 1980, John Lennon was killed by a man namedMark Chapman. A man who prayed to Satan hours before he pulled the trigger, whowalked robotically through the motions of murder, in a trance-like daze, andfound himself in police custody, staring bewilderedly out at the world fromwithin a tiny closet of darkened dreams. A carefully constructed multiplepersonality with a tightly focused purpose, a single target, and ultimatedeniability, who stood and waited for police to arrive, calmly reading TheCatcher in The Rye, that coming-of-age novel by former US Army intelligenceofficer J.D. Salinger. It is doubtful we shall ever learn whether Mark Chapmanwas definitively the victim of an artificially induced model psychosis,“Manchurian Candidate” type assassin deployed by the combined Tavistock/CIA/MI6to silence the increasingly unmanageable Lennon. In the end, it is the dreamerswho die by an assassin’s hand. Quite often, they are killed by men whothemselves are dreamers.Eight months later on August 1, 1981, a new concept was created in televisionthat was part of the Tavistock Institute-led Quiet War for silent weaponstechnology. It was a 24-hour per-day music station called MTV, Music Television.Popular fairy tales aside, MTV, too, was created by the controllers at theworld’s leading think-tanks and brainwashing institutes for the purpose offurther destroying the youth culture and permanently implanting another“generational shift” in modern society.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 1.

Over the past 50 years, research in the fields of psychology, sociologyand psychiatry has shown that “there are clearly marked limits to the amount ofchanges and the nature of them that the mind can deal with.” According toScience Policy Research Unit [SPRU] at Tavistock’s Sussex University facility,‘future shocks’ is defined “as physical and psychological distress arising fromthe excess load on the decision-making mechanism of the human mind.” In otherwords, “a series of events, which come so fast that the human brain cannotabsorb the information.” After continuous shocks, the large targeted populationgroup discovers that it does not want to make choices any more. Apathy takesover, often preceded by mindless violence such as is characteristic of the LosAngeles street gangs in the 1960s and the 1980s. “Such a group becomes easy tocontrol and will docilely follow orders without rebelling, which is the objectof the exercise.”70 70.

One form of dictatorship is being in aprison cell, seeing the bars. The other, a far more subtle form of control anddictatorship is when you can’t see the bars and you think you are free. Thebiggest hypnotist in the world is an oblong box in the corner of the room thattells people what to believe. Television, with its reach into everyone’s home,creates the basis for the mass brainwashing of citizens, as we will see in thischapter. You may not realize it, yet, but your mind is being shaped and mouldedevery time you turn the one eyed baby sitter on.When you watch TV, the right hemisphere is twice as active as the left, which initself is a neurological anomaly. “The crossover from left to right releases asurge of the body’s natural opiates: endorphins, which include beta-endorphinsand enkephalins. Endorphins are structurally identical to opium and itsderivatives (morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.).”1 In other words, your televisionworks as a high-tech drug delivery system, and we all feel its effects. Anothereffect of watching television is that the “higher brain regions such as themidbrain and the neo-cortex, are shut down, and most activity shifts to thelimbic system, your lower brain region. The lower or reptile brain simply standspoised to react to the environment using deeply embedded ‘fight or flight’response programs. Moreover, these lower brain regions cannot distinguishreality from fabricated images (a job performed by the neo-cortex), so theyreact to television content as though it were real, releasing appropriatehormones and so on. Studies have proven that, in the long run, too much activityin the lower brain leads to atrophy in the higher brain regions.”2 Now, you maynot have known this, but I bet you the people who brainwash you on daily basis,surely did. Don´t worry, we will come back to this a bit later.For the brainwashers in charge of this societal transformation, they have pulledoff the ultimate trick. They were able to persuade people that what they can seewith their eyes is all there is to see. Subsequently, people will laugh in yourface when you try to explain to them the bigger picture and the unseen realitybehind the curtain.In a 1981 interview, Hal Becker from a think tank called “Futures Group” inConnecticut said: “I know the secret of making the average American believeanything I want him to. Just let me control television.... You put something onthe television and it becomes reality. If the world outside the TV setcontradicts the images, people start trying to change the world to make it likethe TV set images....”You see, television is not the truth, for as much as people keep tuning in toits lies. Television is an amusement park, a group of jugglers, belly dancers,storytellers, singers and stripers. But you people, have been completelyhypnotised by the Tube. You sit there, day after day, night after night.… TV isall most of you know! Five percent of Americans read more than five books peryear, yet one billion people tune in to the Oscar awards. You dream like a tube,speak like a tube, smell, dress, act like your television. Most people feel theyare better acquainted with Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or Lady Gaga than withtheir own husband or wife. This is madness! Don´t you see? How many millions ofyou are prepared to believe anything the tube tells you? What’s more, hugenumbers of people at the top are prepared to tell you anything in the name of‘war against terror’, audience share and advertising dollars as long as you votefor them, buy their products and allow them to brainwash you. “Televisionprovided an ideal means to create an homogenous culture, a mass culture, throughwhich popular opinion could be shaped and controlled, so that everyone in thecountry would think the same.”3Why is it being done? To dumb you down. To brainwash you. To turn you into atouchy-feely adult with infantile tendencies. So you don’t get in the way ofimportant people by doing too much thinking on your own. Think about it! Over75% of people get all their information from the television. In fact, the onlytruth most people know is what they get over the television. There is an entiregeneration of people who did not know anything that didn´t come out of thistube. This tube has become the Gospel, the ultimate revelation. It can make orbreak presidents and Prime ministers. This tube is the most awesome force inthis God damn world. However, what would happen if it got into the hands of thewrong people? And when the largest company in the world controls the mostawesome propaganda force in the entire Universe, who knows what shit will bepeddled for truth on the networks?THE MAKING OF A FASCIST SOCIETYMost people think they have a pretty good idea about what fascist society is allabout. They have seen the pictures in the made-for-TV movies, of Nazi Germany inthe 1930s. The crowds, the frenzy, the glitter, the jackbooted troops. The hugerallies, the waving of the flags. Then, there were the speeches by Hitler madeto the cheering approval of enormous crowds of people, who raised their arms insalute at the beckoning of their Fuerher. Who can forget the terrifying imagesof Nazi thugs breaking windows in the Jewish ghetto, pulling frail old ladies bytheir hair onto the streets, the Gestapo and the SS troops using the butt end oftheir machine gun to beat someone into a pulp. Then there are other images: thedeath camps and the horrified world that didn´t know anything about them. Thebodies, the teeth, the bones, the walking dead, and the hair and the gold teethand the rings and the ovens.The greatest generation of the 20th century went to war to defeat the greatestevil man has ever seen. Twenty six million Soviets died in the war plus millionsof Europeans and half a million American soldiers. Never again. That’s what weall said once the war ended. Do you remember? The world would never toleratesuch inhumanity again. We would never have another Hitler in our midst. Neverwould human rights be so flagrantly trampled on. Yes, you say. Never again! Areyou sure about that? What if I told you we let the monster back in and you,reader are partially to blame? Would you believe me?Now, take yourselves back to the victorious US troops entering Baghdad andKabul. Think back to the war with Libya. Think back to Operation Desert Storm.Do you remember the parades, the confetti, the tickertape, the troops and thevery expensive equipment parading on television in front of the adoring masseswaving flags? Does that sound familiar? There were millions of people throughoutthe United States celebrating the great victory, waving the little plastic flagswhich were given out by the hundreds of thousands, the cheering approval ofenormous crowds of people, who raised their arms in salute at the beckoning oftheir President and the commanding General. Is it coming back now? I thought itmight. Yes, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. Except, this time, wereally kicked the butts of the stinking A-rabs. Didn´t we? Hi, mom, we arenumber 1!In fact, if you think back, these celebrations were organized by television.Come to think of, as was the scenario for the intervention, which was simplycopied and pasted from past historical events. Think back to Sudan and the SaveDarfur coalition, to Kosovo and the Balkans, to Somalia, Granada, the FalklandIslands. Television acted as a surrogate facilitator of a “largest patrioticcelebration in history” as they were called.As Keith Harmon Snow reports for GlobalResearch on February 7, 2007, inreference to Sudan Britain-inspired conflict. “First: Create instability andchaos that gives the appearance of Arabs fighting Africans (it’s always thoseother people over there killing each other). Second: Wage a media campaign thatfocuses a laser beam of public attention on the rising instability. Third: Whipup public opinion and fury among a highly manipulated Western population whowill, quite literally, believe anything. Fourth: Make sure the devil – this timeit’s the Janjaweed – comes on horseback. This latter point underscores thetight, unwavering narrative of good versus evil. Fifth: Demonize the “enemy”[read: dirty A-Rabs] and their partners [Chinese oil companies and Russian armsdealers]. Sixth: Send Christian soldiers and their “humanitarian” armies onward;Enter “Save Darfur!” and, voilà!, a movement is born. Seventh: Continue to chipaway the power of the enemy by chipping away at their credibility. Eighth: Underthe banners of high moral approbation, and with full support of a deeply caringWestern public, overthrow the malevolent forces [of Islam and the Orient] andinstil a benevolent, peace-loving, pro-democracy government. Last: Wipe away thesanctions, no longer needed, and bring much-needed ‘development’ to anotherbackward country. And there you have it: yet another civilizing mission toconquer those barbaric Arab hoards, and those starving, helpless, uneducated,diseased, AIDS-infested, tribal Africans.” Amen!This example shows the efficiency with which television can organise publicopinion on behalf of foreign military crusades that advance the cause of worldgovernment – without even explicitly stating that world government or One WorldCompany is the goal. Remember, it was the television that told you what you werecelebrating, and the why you must feel proud to be an American or at least beenvious of others who are American. This doesn´t apply solely to the world ofpolitics. Think back to Spain’s 2010 “glorious” world football cup victory. Thecelebration wouldn’t have been the same without TV reaffirming our right to feel“proud.”What you might not have realised, because you were not told this littleunimportant fact, is that prior to media’s “humanitarian” propaganda campaigns,neither Somalia nor Kosovo and certainly not Sudan figured prominently among thetypical American’s concerns. In fact, over 85% of American public could not findSudan on the world map. The same could be said for Somalia and certainly Kosovo,not to mention Iraq prior to the Desert Storm invasion in 1991. 87% of Americansdidn’t know where Iraq was on the map and had no idea who Saddam Hussein wasuntil CNN’s diligent, relentless efforts to indoctrinate the American publicmade those military campaigns possible.Nevertheless, what’s absolutely mind-boggling is that the public neverquestioned any of it. Instead, people chose to participate in the celebration,either directly, lining the streets and waving US flags or through nationaltelevision newscasts.By the end of 2010, more than one and a half million innocent Iraqis are dead,along with Saddam Hussein, 5,000+ American troops and unknown tens of thousandsmaimed for life who are “liberating” the country on behalf of British Petroleum,Royal Dutch Shell, Halliburton, Blackwater, Chase Manhattan Bank, Bank ofAmerica, CitiGroup and an unending plethora of multinational corporations, allvying for a piece of an Iraqi sweepstakes and wealth. Hi mom!Do you think Afghanistan is any different? Another war, another dollar, anotherlist of unsavoury statistics. Between Afghanistan and Iraq, tenths of thousandsof dead children, hundreds of thousands maimed for life. And for whom did wefight? US government overthrew the filthy Taliban, only to replace them with oneof the most corrupt leaders the world has ever seen – Hamid Karzai, a major drugtrafficker in bed with the same unsavoury forces we came to fight against. Himom! Are we still number one? Number one in stupidity is what we are. So, how doyou feel now? This is what you celebrated.And believe me, there is no difference between the jackbooted Nazi thugs fromthe 1930s and the jackbooted democratic liberators from 2011. Without evenrealizing it, you became part of a mob, a fascist mob organized entirely bytelevision.Still don´t believe me? Have you traveled to the United States recently? Theairport personnel, part of the Homeland Security Department, are the samejackbooted Nazi goons who dragged little old Jewish ladies out of their homesand beat them to death with the rifle butt for pleasure and in the name ofsecurity. While you, the model citizen stood and stands idly by, speechless andhelpless. Did it ever occur to you to step in and help? No, because you and yourfellow citizens have been brainwashed by television to never question authority,no matter how shocking and anti-humane their behaviour might be. Or do youreally think you became this way on your own? Think back thirty years. Didpeople behave this way towards their fellow men? Hardly, right? So, whathappened? Along the way, somewhere, we lost our consciousness.Consciousness is something we each develop to the degree we feel and think forourselves. Insofar as we merely accept the emotional and intellectualcommonplaces of others, we remain dead.Let’s put it this way: “The advent and mass dissemination of televisiontechnology has rendered the Nazi model for a fascist society obsolete; it hasprovided a better, more subtle, and more powerful means of social control thanthe organized terror of the Nazi state.”4To most people, this may sounds absolutely shocking. After all, what does aninnocent celebration of democracy or football victory have to do with Nazism,right?THE FASCIST CONCEPT OF MANInvestigative journalist Lonnie Wolfe succinctly tells the story: “The Nazistate was created by the same oligarchical financial and political interests whotoday control what we call the mass media and television. Forget about whateverstories you have seen on television about how Hitler came to power: his path topower was cleared by the same oligarchs who employ the brainwashers that programyour television. Over a period of years, following the First World War, Germanywas brutalised by the economic policy of this international elite. Hitler’sNazis were funded and promoted as a political option, and then steered intopower in 1932-1933.Once in power, the Nazis maintained their hold through the use of terror as partof mass brainwashing. In many ways it were proper to view the Nazi period as anexperiment in methods of mass brainwashing and social control. At the root ofthis experiment was the desire to create a New World Order based on reversing afundamental premise of western Christian civilisation: that man is created as ahigher and distinct species from animals, created in the image of the living Godand by Divine grace, imparted the Divine Spark of reason.”5What makes man human is our power of reason. The only thing greater than life isthe power of the human mind. This is how mankind is measured. What separates usfrom animals is our ability to discover universal physical principles. It allowsus to innovate, which subsequently improves the lives of people. Development ofmankind, the development of the power of the individual and the nation dependsupon scientific developments, upon seeking and discovering the truth as ourhighest goal, thus perfecting our existence. Truth always lies in the higherorder of processes. True sovereignty lies not in popular opinion, but in thecreative powers of the individual human mind.So, it’s a moral problem. Problem of mankind’s destiny. As Lyndon LaRouche oftenstated, “every generation must advance beyond that of the preceding generation.And that hope, that that will happen, should be what’s on the mind of the personwho is dying of old age: that their life has meant something, because it laidthe foundation for a better life than they knew.”6There is a fundamental clash of ideals: Those who measure up to a Renaissanceview of a man and those who see themselves, by birthright above other men, whosee mankind as an animal, whose worst impulses must be repressed by the state.This is the view of the Enlightenment movement, and in its extreme form, thefascist state. “For mass brainwashing to work it must attack the Renaissanceview of man,”7 for no person with a strong moral compass seeking Truth can bebrainwashed.Until we can bring mankind into a real Age of Reason, into the age of progressand human knowledge, history will be shaped in actuality, not by the wills ofmasses of humanity, but by the mere handfuls who, for purposes of good or evil,steer the fate of mankind generally as herds of cows are steered to and from thepasture – and, occasionally, also to the slaughter-house.FREUDIAN MASS BRAINWASHINGAs much as it may surprise many, Nazi Germany was an experiment in Freudian masspsychology. What it means is that both Freud and the Nazis shared the beliefsystem of man as a sinful beast who is allowed to exist under strictly imposedlaws.Man is not made in the image of the living God, says Freud; man has made god inhis image, for the purpose of easing the pain of his existence. Freud calledpast intellectuals “infantile” for their defense of religious doctrine: “Weshall tell ourselves that it were very nice of there were a God who created theworld and was a benevolent Providence...Yet you defend the religious illusionwith all your might. If it becomes discredited – and indeed the threat to it isgreat enough – then your world collapses. There is nothing left for you butdespair of everything, of civilization, of the future of mankind. From thatbondage, I am, we are free. Since we are prepared to renounce a good part of ourinfantile wishes, we can bear it if a few of our expectations turn out to beillusions.”8Freudian psychology, as preached by either Freud or by neo-Freudians like CarlJung, became the rage in the 1920s. It was promoted into the popular culturethrough the mass media of its day, newspaper and magazine articles. “It’smorally insane system of ‘id’, ‘ego’ and ‘superego’ became part of the popularculture as did its belief that creativity stems from sexual drives.”9One of the key elements of Freud’s work on mass psychology stems from ThePsychology of the Crowd of the French psychologist Gustav LeBon who claimed thatman regressed to a primitive mental state as part of a crowd. “People in a crowdlose their inhibitions and moral standards, and become highly emotional.”10LeBon describes this as a return to man’s primitive nature. “Man,” says LeBon,“has returned to his animal roots.” This is what mass mobilization of people isall about. The victory parade is just one example of this phenomenon. The notionthat all good citizens should rally around the flag to attack, is in itself justanother form of social dictate.But there is another side effect to this development. “While he has become atonce more primitive, more animal-like and infantile, mass man, the man in thecrowd, also has a heightened sense of power, while his individual responsibilityfor action – a key factor in all moral judgement – diminishes.”11On the other hand, far from accepting that everything should be directed towarda common purpose, Freud and LeBon ignore the right of minds to follow their owncuriosity wherever it may lead. After all, curiosity...is insubordination in itspurest form, an attitude that in today’s United States would draw you a prisonterm for anti-American activity. The heritage of western Christian civilizationdefends the freedom of the individual mind against the coercion of mass culture,mass propaganda or mass mobilization.“It is just as impossible to do without control of the masses by a minority asit is to dispense with coercion in the work of civilization,” Freud writes inhis 1927 attack on religion, The Future of an Ilusion. “For the masses are lazyand unintelligent.”12 Such thoughts are not far separated from the writings ofHitler; they form the core of Nazi-thinking.Long before Hitler published Mein Kampf, Freud, in his Mass Psychology wroteabout a leadership principle around which the Nazi State was organized. “Anymass, be it a nation, or a randomly created group, must have a leader,” hewrote, adding “someone who gives it its ‘I ideal’ or value. The leader becomesthe individual member’s common ‘I ideal’ and takes over all his criticalfaculties, just as the hypnotised individual surrenders his self-determinationto the hypnotiser. It is the leader,” says Freud, “who provides the common bondfor a mass of people; their common attachment to the leader, enables each memberto identify with each other, giving form and direction to the mass.”Was Hitler a Freudian? “It is known that Hitler read LeBon,” writes Lonnie Wolfein his piece on “The Making of a Fascist Society”: “It cannot be establishedthat he read Freud, especially Mass Psychology. But it is clear that those whoput Hitler in power and those who steered his movement read Freud, as did mostof the ruling elite of the day: it was they who were promoting the Freudiancraze and its propaganda throughout the world.”13CARL JUNG AND HITLEROne key neo-Freudian who became an overt supporter of the Nazis was the Swisspsychoanalyst Carl Jung, whose friendship with Freud ended over the latter’srefusal to see value in Gnostic mysticism. Freud, who was opposed to integratingmystical ideas into psychoanalysis, associated the word mysticism with séances,voices from other worlds, noises, apparitions, levitation, trances andprophecies.“Jung saw in Hitler the apotheosis of Jung’s own search for a kind of pagancommunion with the Beyond, a search that began in 1915, with Jung’s colossalnervous breakdown.”14In his 1997 essay on the subject of Hitler and Jung, Wolfe believes there is thestrongest possible connection between Jung’s psychoanalytic theories, which formone of the conceptual bases of “New Age” ideology today, and his fascinationwith Hitler. “For Jung was obsessed by the notion that the deepest reality, thegreatest truth, lay buried in the unconscious, mystical, psychotic aspects ofMan’s mind, as opposed to the rational, outward, scientific, Judeo-Christianview of the world.”15 That was the basis of Jung’s decades long search throughhimself, “attempting to find a pre-existing myth or mythic system which aptlyillustrated his ideas about the human psychology of religion.”16 He began withGnosticism, then went on to study astrology and then speculative alchemy as asymbolic system.To Jung, there is a deep substratum of consciousness that lies beneath thelayers of mechanical instincts and the measurable phenomena of clinicalpsychology. Jung called it the “collective unconscious.” These images becomevisible under certain circumstances, such as in political rallies or religiousrituals or on the movie screen or in advertising and propaganda, and we takethem for granted without realizing the power they represent or the extent towhich they may be manipulating our consciousness. And in turn, these images,this pattern or matrix underlying the observed universe, a kind of grid ofconnections linking events according to a system we can only barely perceive,are manipulated by the unseen hand of the brainwashers at Tavistock Instituteand Frankfurt School.Tavistock Institute for Human Relations is the psychological warfare arm of theBritish Royal family, located in a suburb of London. It is the world’s mostimportant institution for manipulation of population. According to the officialhistory of the Tavistock Clinic: “In 1920, under its founder Dr. HughCrichton-Miller’s leadership, the Clinic made a significant contribution to theunderstanding of the traumatic effects of ‘shell shock’”17 In the 1930s, theTavistock Institute developed a symbiotic relationship with the FrankfurtInstitute for Social Research. Their collaboration led them to analyze theculture of a population from a neo-Freudian standpoint. Nazism, just happened tohave been one of its ‘patients on a psychiatric couch.’In a nutshell, Hitler was the prototype of Jungian man, who surrendered hisreason to his unconscious, and who welcomed divine madness as Jung himselfadvised.Jung had been impressed by Hitler’s meteoric rise to power and recognised thatthe dictator “must have tapped some extraordinary energy in the Teutonicunconscious.”18 For example, in March 1934, Jung was writing of the “formidablephenomenon of National Socialism on which the whole world gazes withastonishment19 Jung goes on to suggest that the Aryan unconscious has a “higherpotential than the Jews.” Hitler, Jung wrote, “had literally set all Germany onits feet.” In a 1932 essay, Jung had celebrated the “leader personality” of theFuehrer, as against the “ever-secondary, lazy masses, who cannot take the leastmove in the absence of a demagogue.” In 1936, Jung perceived Hitler to be of thepreviously repressed Wotanic (Ancient Germanic God) elements: “The impressivething about the German phenomenon is that one man, who is obviously possessedhas infected a whole nation to such an extent that everything is set in motionand has started rolling on its course towards perdition.”20Was Jung unaware of the Nazi’s true nature? Hardly. In 1938, five years afterHitler’s rise to power, Jung classified Hitler as “visionary” and “a trulyinspired shaman or medicine man” whose power was “magical rather thanpolitical,” a “spiritual vessel,” the “first man to tell every German what hehas been thinking and feeling all along in his unconscious about German fate.”21Jung added that “Hitler’s power is not political, it is magic.”As France surrendered to Germany in June 1940 – the date, the summer solstice,did not pass unnoticed by Jung and other Nazi mystics – Jung cried ecstatically,“It is the dawning of the Age of Aquarius!” It is rather fine irony that it wasCarl Jung, of all people, who coined that phrase made current so much later,with the rise of the “New Age.”Needless to say, the Nazis represented but a minority of the German population,even when they were in power. What about the so-called “good Germans” who wentalong with Hitler’s terror? How was it done? The same way, it is being done tous today, and every day, through the mass media dissemination of “information.”And the most universal of the mass media was radio. In fact, once in power, theNazis ordered the production and mass dissemination of cheap radio receivers forthe entire population of the country. This is the real meaning of “massaudience.” The concept behind it was the same as discussed by Freud in MassPsychology, that is “individuals participating in the mass phenomenon aresusceptible to suggestion, to losing his moral conscience – thus becomeoverwhelmed by the mass experience.” Brainwashers call it “institutional humanaggressiveness,” what people like Freud say proves that people, us, are animalsdriven towards destruction. According to Freud, these aggressive destructivedrives are “part of man’s animal nature.” The purpose of society, according toFreud, is to “regulate and control through various forms of coercion theoutbursts of this innate bestiality against which the human mind is ultimatelypowerless.” Freud’s principal point was that “masses of people can be organizedaround appeals to the emotions. The most powerful such appeals are to theunconscious, which has the power to dominate and throw aside reason.”“The mass has never thirsted for truth,” Freud wrote, referring to crowds of rawminds swayed by elementary needs. “They demand illusions and cannot do withoutthem. They constantly give what is unreal precedence over what is real; they arealmost as strongly influenced by what is untrue as what is true. They have anevident tendency not to distinguish between the two.”Freud, in his Mass Psychology stated that an individual’s moral inhibitions andoutlook can be broken down as parts of a mass. Lonnie Wolfe succinctly tells thestory of Freud’s so-called powerful mass experience which can gratify emotions:“Freud further stated that under this condition, with man’s reason dominated byemotionalism and unable and unwilling to look for Truth, the individual in acrowd loses his moral conscience, or what Freud calls his ego ideal.” To Freud,this is not necessarily a bad thing, “since the moral conscience or thesuperego, causes man to unnaturally repress his basic animal instincts; ThisFreud claims produces neurosis. In a crowd organized around people’s emotions,the individual will exhibit a tendency to ‘let himself go,’ to free himself ofall moral and social inhibitions. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual;in a crowd, he is a barbarian – that is creature acting by instinct.” Therefore,the key to mass brainwashing is to create an organized, controlled environmentin which “stress and tension can be applied to break down morally informedjudgement, thereby making an individual more susceptible to suggestion.”22The point to be made here is that co-participation in a crowd causes a person torespond to situation from an emotionally-non-thinking set of reference points.In the case of Nazi Germany, coming across the radio, into millions of homes,was the voice of one man, Adolf Hitler. The fact that all of Germany was hearinghis voice at the same time gave an enhanced power to the message. The listenerwas literally part of a mass-experience, taking it all in from anemotionally-non-thinking set of reference points. Hitler’s speeches were some ofthe first mass-media events in history, as carefully staged as any event inmodern history.Both Tavistock and the Frankfurt School paid close attention to Nazi propagandatechniques, which they willingly incorporated into their research. The aim ofthis project, as stated in Adorno’s Introduction to the Sociology of Music, wasto “program a mass culture as a form of extensive social control that wouldsteadily degrade its consumers.” The application of their research into humanbehaviour was set to launch a decade later in a major irreversible CulturalRevolution in America.“The brainwashers concluded that mass media events had caused people to suspendtheir belief in reality, that they had in fact been willing to acceptuncritically things being said, which if they had heard in another context theywould most probably had rejected.” Now, think back to today. How insane are someof the things we have been told by our leaders? Weapons of mass destruction inIraq, Iranian mullahs allegedly threatening the security of the United States,Libyan leader Mu’ammar al-Qaddafi supplying his troops with viagra in order torape women participating in the rebellion, Usama bin Laden’s death. ExplainsWolfe: “During the Second World War, Bruno Bettleheim, a neo-Freudian, publisheda psychological analysis of the Nazi period at the behest of the network ofbrainwashers associated with the Tavistock Institute. Bettleheim describes howunder extreme doubt and terror, the individual will regress to an increasinglymore infantile state. In that condition, the inmates of the nazi concentrationcamps started to mirror the personalities and mannerisms of their oppressors,the SS guards. In a widely circulated version of his work, The Informed Heart,he indicated that life outside the concentration camps mirrored thepsychological disintegration taking place inside: all German citizens werebecoming more infantile, less able to act as reasonable adults.”23In The Informed Heart, Bettleheim writes: “the ‘good German’ had to be unseenand also dumb...It is one thing to behave like a child because one is achild...It is quite another thing to be an adult and have to force oneself toassume childish behaviour. It was not just coercion by others into helplessdependency. It was also the clean splitting of the personality. Man’s anxiety,his wish to protect life, forced him to relinquish what was ultimately his bestchance of survival: his ability to react and make appropriate decisions. Butgiving this up, he was no longer a man, but a child. Knowing that for survival,he should decide and act, and trying to survive by not reacting – these in theircombination overpowered the individual to such a degree that he was eventuallyshort of all self respect and all feelings of independence.”24In the end, the Nazi experiment failed and the Nazis themselves, a group ofgnostic psychotics, had to be destroyed by the same forces who put them in powerin the first place. In the meantime, the Third Reich caused a massive shift ofconsciousness in the planet, a paradigm shift, if you like. Although occultismand politics have long been bedfellows, since the days of Joseph interpretingdreams for Pharaoh, or King Saul consulting the witch of Endor, or even earlierin the astral temples at Nineveh and Babylon, the world came very close toenduring a massive and industrialised ‘cult-ocracy’ in the form of the ThirdReich. It is worth repeating here that the Nazi Party was not a political party,as we commonly understand it, but a cult.“Nazi appropriation of the occult was a weird farrago of astrology, Freemasonry,racism rooted in occultism and popular European folklore (the Cathars, the HolyGrail, the Knights Templar, the Arthurian legends). Sinister Forces at workagainst humanity. In Morning of the Magicians, one of the most explosive booksof the 1960s, the authors identified these forces in paranormal terms, butalways linking them back to the fascist fantasies of Hitler, Himmler, Rosenberg,Darre and Hess: blatant occult fantasies that became government policy and whichled to the Holocaust and World War II.”25 That millions of innocent people diedbecause of this twisted dream is the greatest tragedy of the XX century. But theauthors insisted that there was something there, below the surface of the ThirdReich: a sinister force that had been successfully, for a time, evoked by theNazi magicians of the SS. The phenomenon of ‘coincidence’ or what Carl Jungcalled “synchronicity” was the most obvious evidence of the operation of thisforce and one which the authors suggested could be the basis of a whole “newconception of history.”26And when it was all over, those who imposed this horror on the world attemptedthrough mass media to blame their victims for the crimes committed. The Germans,whom the oligarchy through their Nazi tools, had tortured in mass brainwashingwere told that they were collectively guilty for all that happened. As a result,the entire nation was put in the dock, and tried as criminals, rapists and massmurderers. And while we were told that it must never happen again, thebrainwashers at such places as Tavistock Institute were already secretly workingbehind the scenes on a new and far more powerful brainwashing tool – television,to help them organize their fascist ‘superstate’ without the now sociallyunacceptable Nazi superstructure.Now, how many people actually understand this? How many people realize that themajority’s perception of reality, especially in political arenas, is not theirown. It is shrewdly manipulated and imposed upon them by the Men behind theCurtain. Many certainly do not and brainwashing has a lot to do with it.CONTROLLING THE ENVIRONMENTWhat became obvious to the brainwashers is that a new system, based on appeal toemotionalism, was needed. And in order to break through the population’s moralcompass, society needed to be reduced to infantilism. Writing in 1972,Tavistock’s leading media expert, Dr. Fred Emery, reported on television’simpact on Americans: “We are suggesting that television evokes a basicassumption of dependency. It must evoke (this) because it is essentially anemotional and irrational activity...television is the non-stop leader whoprovides nourishment and protection.”In his informative report on television’s impact on cognitive powers of anindividual, investigative journalist, Lonnie Wolfe says that both Emery and EricTrist, who until his death in 1993 headed Tavistock’s operations in the UnitedStates, noted that “all television had a dissociative effect on mentalcapabilities, making people less able to think rationally. Viewers, as theybecome habituated to watching six hours or more of television daily, surrendertheir powers of reason to the images and sound coming from the tube.”27Tavistock recognised that habituated television watching destroys the ability ofa person for critical cognitive activity. In other words, it makes you stupid.For to bring society down to the level of a beast is especially important fromthe point of view of Tavistock, if they are to control the planet Earth. “Sincethe only source of increase of mankind’s power, as a species, within and uponthe universe, is that manifold of validated discoveries of physical principle,it follows, that the only form of human action that distinguished man frombeast, is that form of action, which is identified as cognition, by means ofwhich the act of discovery of accumulated validatable universal physicalprinciples is generated. It is the accumulation of such knowledge for practice,in this way, from generation to generation, which defines the provable evidenceof the absolute difference between man and beast.”28However, dissociative effect is but one of the aspects of overcoming resistanceand changing the established paradigm of society, according to brainwashers atTavistock Institute. Listen to Theodore Adorno of Frankfurt School: “It seemsobvious, that the modification of the potentially fascist structure cannot beachieved by psychological means alone. The task is comparable to that ofeliminating neurosis, or delinquency, or nationalism from the world. These areproducts of the total organization of society and are to be changed only as thatsociety is changed. It is not for the psychologist to say how such changes areto be brought about. The problem is one, which requires the efforts of allsocial scientists. All that we would insist upon is that in the councils orround tables where the problem is considered and action planned the psychologistshould have a voice. We believe that the scientific understanding of societymust include an understanding of what it does to people, and that it is possibleto have social reforms, even broad and sweeping ones, which though desirable intheir own right would not necessarily change the structure of the prejudicedpersonality. For the fascist potential to change, or even to be held in check,there must be an increase in people’s capacity to see themselves and to bethemselves. This cannot be achieved by the manipulation of people, however wellgrounded in modern psychology the devices of manipulation might be.… It is herethat psychology may play its most important role. Techniques for overcomingresistance, developed mainly in the field of individual psychotherapy, can beimproved and adapted for use with groups and even for use on a mass scale.”29SOCIAL TURBULENCEAs a point of interest, at Tavistock, Eric Trist and Frederick Emery developed atheory of “social turbulence,” a so-called “softening up effect of futureshocks” – wherein a population could be softened up through mass phenomena suchas energy shortages, economic and financial collapse, or terrorist attack. “Ifthe ‘shocks’ were to come close enough to each other and if they were deliveredwith increasing intensity, then it was possible to drive the entire society intoa state of mass psychosis,” claimed Trist and Emery. They also stated that“individuals would become disassociated, as they tried to flee from the terrorof the shocking, emerging reality; people would withdraw into a state of denial,retreating into popular entertainments and diversions, while being prone tooutbursts of rage.”In fact, we are talking about two sides of the same coin here. On one side,guiding the covert, subtle manipulation and control of thought and humanconsciousness through the power of television; while on the other side, directlyand overtly shifting the paradigm, changing the basic concepts, widening theparameters, and changing the rules by which society defines itself.One of the key individuals involved in psychological warfare against thepopulation through manufactured social turbulence is Kurt Lewin, a pioneer ingroup dynamics who was part of the early Frankfurt School and fled Germany whenHitler took power. This passage from his book Time Perspective and Morale, showshis understanding of psychological warfare: “One of the main techniques forbreaking morale through a ‘strategy of terror’ consists in exactly this tactic –keep the person hazy as to where he stands and just what he may expect. If inaddition frequent vacillations between severe disciplinary measures and promisesof good treatment together with spreading of contradictory news, make the‘cognitive structure’ of this situation utterly unclear, then the individual maycease to even know when a particular plan would lead toward or away from hisgoal. Under these conditions even those who have definite goals and are ready totake risks, will be paralyzed by severe inner conflicts in regard to what todo.”30Over the past 50 years, research in the fields of psychology, sociology andpsychiatry has shown that the human mind is capable in dealing with a limitednumber of changes around it. According to Science Policy Research Unit [SPRU] atTavistock’s Sussex University facility, ‘future shocks’ is defined “as physicaland psychological distress arising from the excess load on the decision-makingmechanism of the human mind.” In other words, “a series of events, which come sofast that the human brain cannot absorb the information.” One scenario is calledsuperficiality. After continuous shocks, according to Emery and Trist, “thelarge targeted population group discovers that it does not want to make choicesany more, reducing the value of his intentions... This strategy can only bepursued by denying the deeper roots of humanity that bind...people together on apersonal level by denying their individual psyche.”Apathy takes over, often preceded by mindless violence such as is characteristicof the Los Angeles street gangs in the 1960s and the 1980s, what Emery and Tristcall organized social response to dissociation, as described in the pages ofAnthony Burgess’ novel A Clockwork Orange, a society dominated by infantileanimal-like rage. “Such a group becomes easy to control and will docilely followorders without rebelling, which is the object of the exercise,”31 add Trist andEmery. What’s more, “the dissociated adults cannot exert moral authority overtheir children, because they are too involved with their own infantilefantasies, brought to them through their television set.”32 And if you doubtwhat I am saying, look at the older generation today as they have accepted themoral decadence of the no-future generation of its children, rather than seekconflict, and in the process, the adults have come to accept a lower moralstandard.Just as in Huxley’s drug-controlled Brave New World, there are no moral oremotional choices to make here, the ‘flower children’ and the drug-soakedrebellion of the Vietnam era is a perfect example of how this scenariofunctions.These ‘frequent vacillations’ pass through several scenarios: Stable, at whichpoint, people more or less are able to adapt to what is happening to them, or itis turbulent, “at which point people either take actions to relieve the tension,or they adapt to accept tension-filled environment.”33 If the turbulence doesnot cease, or is intensified, then “at a certain point people cease being ableto adapt in a positive way.”34 According to Trist and Emery, “people becomemaladaptive – they choose a response to tension that degrades their lives. Theystart to repress reality, denying its existence, and constructing increasinglymore infantile fantasies that enable them to cope. Under the conditions ofincreasing social turbulence, people change their values, yielding to newdegraded values, values that are less human and more animal-like.”35The second scenario is segmentation of society into smaller parts. In thisscenario, “it is every group, ethnic, racial, and sexual against the other.”36Nations break apart into regional groups, those smaller areas in turn fissureinto even smaller areas, along ethnic lines. Trist and Emery refer to it as“enhancement of in-group and out-group prejudices as people seek to simplifytheir choices. The natural lines of social divisions emerge to becomebarricades.”Society’s response to such a psychological and political disintegration is theOrwellian fascist state, modelled on his book 1984. In the book, “Big Brother”regulates the lives and conflicts of people within a society; a never endingconflict “is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the objectof the war is not to make or prevent conquest of territory, but to keep thestructure of society in tact.”37“The third scenario is the most intense, involving a withdrawal and retreat intoprivate world and a withdrawal from social bonds that might entail being drawninto the affairs of others.”38 How is this level of dissociation different fromtoday’s 15-24 age group? How far removed are we from this moral and socialoutlook? Almost there, aren’t we? Trist and Emery are convinced that men will bewilling to accept “the perverse inhumanity of man that characterised Nazism.”Not necessarily the structure of the Nazi state, but the moral outlook of Nazisociety.To survive in such a state, people will need to create a new religion. Wolfestates that “the old religious forms, especially western Christianity, demandthat man be responsible for his fellow humans. The new religious forms, will bea form of mystical anarchism, a religious experience much likened to satanicpractice of the Nazis or the views of Carl Jung.”39 This is the “New Age,” the“Age of Aquarius” preached by Tavistock and Frankfurt School with its eastern,mystical religious cults that had young, brainwashed converts flocking toembrace this degeneracy. Again, it is television that provides the “social glue”that binds the minds of the population to their new religious forms.NEWSSPEAKMost Americans and Europeans alike believe that there is such a thing as a freepress, one of the key areas in brainwashing the population. Most Americans andEuropeans get most of their news from state-controlled television, under themisconception that reporters are meant to serve the public. In fact, reportersdo not serve the public. Reporters are paid employees and serve the mediaowners, whose company’s shares are traded on Wall Street. Of the six to eight hours per day Americans spend watching television,40 forexample, a couple of hours is spent watching current affairs programming.Control over the media has been a long-term objective of the globalist elite. InFebruary 1917, Congressman Oscar Callaway placed a statement in theCongressional Record describing the origins of what he called the “newspapercombination.” According to that account, the J.P. Morgan Banking interests andtheir allies “got together 12 men high up in the newspaper world and employedthem to select the most influential newspapers in the United States and thesufficient number of them to control generally the policy of the daily press inthe United States.” Today, the New Media Monopoly puts the number at fivecorporations controlling America’s Fourth Estate.As I explain in my book on the Bilderberg Group, in 1993 August/Septemberedition, the prestigious Dutch magazine Exposure outlined disturbing detailsabout how the Tavistock Institute for Behavioural Analysis, planned to controlthe boards of the three major and most prestigious television networks in theUnited States: NBC, CBS and ABC. All three television networks came as spin offsfrom the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). These organizations andinstitutions that theoretically are in “competition” with each other – this ispart of the “independence” that ensures Americans enjoy unbiased news – are infact closely interfaced and interlocked with countless companies and banks,making it an almost impossible task to untangle them.Take NBC, for example. NBC has been affiliated with RCA, a media conglomerate,and is now a subsidiary of Morgan-controlled General Electric. On RCA’s boardsits Thornton Bradshaw, president of Atlantic Richfield Oil, and member of theWorld Wildlife Fund, the Club of Rome, the Aspen Institute for HumanisticStudies, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Bradshaw is also chairman of NBC.Council on Foreign Relations is part of the Royal Institute for InternationalAffairs. RIIA, is a front organization for The Round Table Group, “stemmed froma secret society created by British magnate Cecil Rhodes to unite the world –beginning with the English-speaking dominions – under ‘enlightened’ elitistslike himself.” (Quigley, Tragedy and Hope) This front organization, the RoyalInstitute for International Affairs, had as its nucleus in each area theexisting submerged Round Table Group. In New York it is known as the Council onForeign Relations.RCA’s most legendary role, however, was the service it provided to BritishIntelligence during World War II. Of particular note: RCA’s President DavidSarnoff moved to London at the same time Sir William Stephenson (of Intrepidfame) moved into the RCA building in New York. Today, RCA’s directorate is madeup of British-American establishment figures that belong to other organizationssuch as the CFR, NATO, the Club of Rome, the Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg,Round Table, etc.Among the NBC directors named in the Exposure article were John Brademas (CFR,TC, Bilderberg), a director of the Rockefeller Foundation; Peter G. Peterson(CFR), a former head of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. (Rothschild), and a former U.S.Secretary of Commerce; Robert Cizik, chairman of RCA and of First City Bancorp,which was identified in Congressional testimony as a Rothschild bank. Clearlythe NBC board is considerably influenced by the Rockefeller-Rothschild-Morgantroika, leading exponents of the One World Company Ltd.ABC is owned by Disney Corporation. It has 153 TV stations. Chase Manhattan Bankcontrols 6.7% of ABC’s stock – enough to give it a controlling interest. Chase,through its trust department, controls 14% of CBS and 4.5% of RCA. Instead ofthree competing networks called NBC, CBS and ABC, what we really have is theRockefeller Broadcasting Company, the Rockefeller Broadcasting System, and theRockefeller Broadcasting Consortium.On the ABC board of directors is Ray Adam, director of J.P. Morgan, MetropolitanLife (Morgan), and Morgan Guarantee Trust; Frank Cary, chairman of IBM, anddirector of J.P. Morgan and the Morgan Guarantee Trust; John T. Connor (CFR) ofthe Kuhn Loeb (Rothschild) law firm; George Jenkins, chairman of MetropolitanLife (Morgan) and Citibank (Rothschild connection); Martin J. Schwab, directorof Manufacturers Hanover (Rothschild).Isn´t it strange how the same Rockefeller-Rothschild-Morgan characters on theboard of the ABC network, which we are told, is independent of NBC, appear torepresent the competition? ABC was taken over by Cities Communication, whosemost prominent director is Robert Roosa (CFR, Bilderberg), senior partner ofBrown Brothers Harriman, which has close ties with the Bank of England. Roosaand David Rockefeller are credited with selecting Paul Volcker to chair theFederal Reserve Board. Selection of Volcker formed part of Tavistock’s plan fora permanent condition of social turbulence, such as the CFR’s Project 1980s andits “controlled disintegration” of the U.S. economy: a pre-planned collapse,carried out by Volcker and his high interest rate policy of the 1979-82 period.CBS is owned by Viacom, which has over 200 TV and 255 radio affiliatesnationwide. This huge media conglomerate owns, among other companies, MTV,Showtime, VH1, TNN, CMT, 39 broadcast television stations, 184 radio stationsand Paramount Pictures. As an American intelligence officer, CBS founder WilliamPaley was trained in mass brainwashing techniques during World War II at theTavistock Institute in England.The financial expansion of CBS was supervised for a long time by Brown BrothersHarriman and its senior partner, Prescott Bush (father and grandfather toPresidents), who was a CBS director. The Board includes Chairman Paley, for whomPrescott Bush personally organized the money to buy the company; Harold Brown(CFR), executive director of the Trilateral Commission, and former Secretary ofthe Air Force and of Defense of the U.S.; Roswell Gilpatric (CFR, Bilderberg)from the Kuhn, Loeb (Rothschild) law firm; Henry B. Schnacht, director of theChase Manhattan Bank (Rockefeller/ Rothschild), CFR, Brookings Institute;Franklin A. Thomas (CFR), head of the Rockefeller-controlled Ford Foundation;Newton D. Minor (CFR), director of the RAND Corporation and, among many others,the Ditchley Foundation, which is closely linked with the Tavistock Institute inLondon and the Bilderberg Group. The former president of CBS was Dr. FrankStanton (CFR), who is also trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation and CarnegieInstitution. So are the Rothschild and Rockefeller families, who are the leadinggroups in the tightly controlled field of communications working closely withTavistock Institute in London.Fox News, part of News Corp, with their daily Nuremberg rallies for couchpotatoes, is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns a significant part of the world’smedia, amongst them his flagship publication, the Wall Street Journal, MySpaceand 20th Century Fox movie studio. Murdoch’s Media Empire has been the mainpropaganda outlet for the perpetual war of the neo-cons and their Nazi minions.Then, there is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. PBS, supposedly is apublic institution. According to its web site, “PBS, is a non-profit mediaenterprise owned and operated by the nation’s … public television stations. Atrusted community resource, PBS uses the power of non-commercial television, theInternet and other media to enrich the lives of all Americans through qualityprograms and education services that inform, inspire and delight. Available to99 percent of American homes with television and to an increasing number ofdigital multimedia households, PBS serves nearly 90 million people each week.”41The cornerstone of PBS’s programming was, unti a few tears ago, the eveningtelevision news program, The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. Jim Lehrer is a member ofthe Council on Foreign Relations. For most of PBS’s history, funding wasprovided by AT&T (A CFR company); Archer Daniels Midland, whose Chairman DwayneAndreas was a member of the Trilateral Commission; PepsiCo (a CFR company),whose Chief Executive Officer, Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi, is a Bilderberg andTrilateral Commission Executive Committee member; and smith Barney (a CFRcompany), one of the world’s leading financial institutions. Furthermore, SmithBarney is interlocked with Citigroup Inc., a global financial services companythat is a member of the Bilderberg Group, CFR and the Trilateral Commission.Journalists who participate in The NewsHour are some of the best-known politicalpundits in the United States, such as Paul Gigot, David Gergen, William Kristoland William Safire. All of them are members of Bilderberg Group, CFR or theTrilateral Commission.Would it be reasonable for us to suspect that PBS might not be quite asimpartial in certain delicate matters of public interest, such as the U.S.Constitutional crisis envisioned by Brzezinski, the future of nation-staterepublics, and of national sovereignty?Still not convinced? “American media elites practice a brutal, albeitwell-concealed, form of ‘wartime’ news censorship, but the mechanisms of thiscontrol are now openly acknowledged. John Chancellor, the longtime NBC-TV newsanchorman, in his recent autobiographical account of life in the news room, TheNew News Business,42 admitted that, through formal structures such as theAssociated Press, informal ‘clubs’ such as the New York Council on ForeignRelations, decisions are made, on a daily or weekly basis, about what theAmerican people will be told, and what stories will never see the light ofday.”43David Rockefeller specifically identified the New York Times and the WashingtonPost as key media organs of the power elite.As Michel Chossudovsky explains on the pages of globalresearch.com,“historically, the New York Times, with utterly unwarranted self-assurance,designates itself the arbiter of ‘All the News that’s Fit to Print,’ has servedthe interests of the Rockefeller family in the context of a longstandingrelationship. The current New York Times chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. is amember of the Council on Foreign Relations, son of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger andgrandson of Arthur Hays Sulzberger who served as a Trustee for the RockefellerFoundation. Ethan Bronner, deputy foreign editor of the New York Times as wellas Thomas Friedman among others are also members of the Council on ForeignRelations (CFR).”44America’s corporate media are an integral part of the economic establishment,with links to Wall Street, the Washington think-tanks, Club Bilderberg and theCouncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) and through them to the world’s premierbrainwashing center, Tavistock Institute. CFR is “the premier U.S. foreignpolicy think-tank in the United States, and is one of the central institutionsfor socializing American elites from all major sectors of society (media,banking, academia, military, intelligence, diplomacy, corporations, NGOs, civilsociety, etc.), where they work together to construct a consensus on majorissues related to American imperial interests around the world. As such, the CFRoften sets the strategy for American policy, and wields enormous influencewithin policy circles, where key players almost always come from the rank andfile of the CFR itself.”45CFR’s former President, Sir Winston Lord, made an interesting observation whenhe said that “The Trilateral Commission doesn’t secretly run the world. TheCouncil on Foreign Relations does that.”46In his October 30, 1993 “Ruling Class Journalists” essay, Washington Postombudsman Richard Harwood candidly discussed how the CFR dominates the newsmedia. Harwood described it as the “the closest thing we have to a rulingEstablishment in the United States.… Its members are the people who, for morethan half a century, have managed our international affairs and ourmilitary-industrial complex.” After listing the executive branch positions thenoccupied by CFR members, Harwood continued: “What is distinctly modern about thecouncil these days is the considerable involvement of journalists and othermedia figures, who account for more than 10 percent of the membership.“The editorial page editor, deputy editorial page editor, executive editor,managing editor, foreign editor, national affairs editor, business and financialeditor and various writers as well as (the now deceased) Katherine Graham, thepaper’s principal owner, represent the Washington Post in the council’smembership,” observed Harwood. These media heavyweights “do not merely analyseand interpret foreign policy for the United States; they help make it,” heconcluded. Rather than offering an independent perspective on our rulers’actions, the Establishment media act as the ruling elite’s voice – conditioningthe public to accept, and even embrace “insider” designs that otherwise mightnot be politically attainable.PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGNEven in the age of internet, blogaspheres and other new generation contraptionsof mass dissemination of information, the Times and the Post, both Bilderbergand CFR companies, set the tone for most news coverage, defining issues andsetting the limits of “respectable” opinion.Consider, for example, Sudan or Libya to illustrate how the mainstream rulingclass journalists “help make” foreign policy through a blatant propagandacampaign.“Saturation reporting from a crisis region; emergency calls for help broadcaston the electronic media (such as the one recently on the CFR run PBS); televisedpictures of refugees (such as the one recently on CFR run Fox and CNN); luridstories of ‘mass rapes,’ which are surely designed to titillate as much toprovoke outrage; reproachful evocations of the Rwandan genocide; demands thatsomething must be done (‘How can we stand idly by?’, etc.); editorials (in theCFR run New York Times, Washington Post, Newsweek, Time magazine and in CFR’sown Foreign Affairs magazine with long winded opinion pieces by Bilderberg-CFRmember Zbiegniew Brzezinski), calling for a return to the days of RudyardKipling’s benevolent imperialism; and, finally, the announcement that plans areindeed being drawn up for an intervention.”47Now, let’s turn on the television and see for ourselves how the news is packagedfor our consumption. All ‘news items’ are told in short bits, most running nolonger than 30 seconds; a major news item may run up to a minute or a minute anda half. Voice over pictures. Short interviews, usually only a few sentences, afew snippets of disjointed thought. The average half an hour segment may reportup to 40 items, all presented in a seamless style, followed by sports, weather,entertainment and idle banter between the newsreaders.But, are we witnessing real events from the real world? Is that how complexworld issues are seen in situ? Libya shoehorned into a 30-second sound bite?Afghanistan’s 2,000 years of history into a 45-second interview dissected intothree shorter interview bits, each consisting of three sentences of six words?Or is it a badly distorted picture that the newsreader tells you is reality?Given the way the news is presented, does your mind ever engage in deliberativethought about any single item? No, it doesn´t. Rather, you watch, merely take inthe information, in the format it is presented to you. Would it surprise youthen, if I told you that within two hours, most viewers could only remembervague summary about what they saw? Middle East is on fire. More civilians werekilled somewhere. Floods wiped out a large chunk of land in...yes, where?European economy is weak and another country has asked to be rescued. There wasan earthquake in Japan and miraculously someone survived a nine-day ordealburied under rubble. Wow! Cool! Get that person on the Oprah Winfrey Show! Himom, I am on TV!In his article on the “Cartelization of the News Industry,” Jeffrey Steinbergexplains that “even the live coverage of car crashes, gang murders, rapes,natural disasters, wars, terrorist acts, is served up on the basis of carefulstudies conducted at the neurological divisions of the leading medical schools.In recent decades, psychological warfare experts have unveiled a newpseudo-science called ‘victimology,’ developed by the London TavistockInstitute, which is premised upon the theory that individuals can be put throughtrauma by being exposed to shockingly graphic visual accounts of violence.”48This type of brainwashing, according to Lonnie Wolfe, is called “selectiveretention. Television causes people to suspend their critical judgementcapabilities because the combination of sound and images places the individualin a dream-like state, which limits cognitive powers.”49If you were to summarize the news items, what would you say? That we are livingin a violent and degraded society. In other words, a degraded view of man asanimal, killing, murdering, raping innocent people the world over. Secondaryimage: economic collapse, fear and hopelessness. You are left with this vividimage of society planted in your head. It is painted thus because no cognitivethought process was used to arrive at the real story behind the events.Hal Becker from the Futures Group contends that through the control oftelevision news programming, he can create popular opinion by manipulating theway you think and act. “Americans think they are governed by some bureaucrats inWashington who make laws and hand out money. How wrong they are. Americans areruled by their prejudices and their prejudices are organized by publicopinion... We think that we make up our minds about everything. We are soconceited. Public opinion makes up our minds. It works our herd instinct, likewe are frightened animals.”But there is a very big difference between a beast and a man. This differencelies in our search for eternal Truth and for the meaning of Life. Truth alwayslies in the higher order of processes and in the creative powers of theindividual human mind. So, it’s a moral problem. The problem of mankind’sdestiny that no animal can ever solve. Every generation must advance beyond thatof the preceding generation. And that hope, that that will happen, should bewhat’s on the mind of the person who is dying of old age: that their life hasmeant something, because it laid the foundation for a better life than theyknew.On the other hand, people like Freud, Bertrand Russell, Eric Trist, Emery,Adorno who believe there is no significant difference between man and animal,must deny the existence and relevance of eternal Truth and our search for themeaning of Life, to render all men morally insane.“Television, with its overwhelming presence in your life, both creates popularopinion and simultaneously validates it.”50 How is it done, exactly? That’sbecause your identity, thanks to television, is shaped by what others thinkabout them – “a constant and unending desire to act as you perceive others wouldwant you to act.”51For example, “America is saying ‘NO’ to drugs,” according to the latest polls byGallup, says a smiling face of a young journalist on CNN. Is that right? Are wesupposed to believe this nonsense just because a poll says so? Or because CNNsays so? As Becker says, “the world is in that box. And it’s there every night.Well, it’s really there a lot more than that: 6-8 hours per day.”In a sense, the ‘news’ media generally tell one story: The saga of Government asSavior. On nearly every conceivable issue, domestic or foreign, news stories aredesigned to encourage readers and viewers to look to government intervention asa solution. In other words, the establishment media are guilty of conscious andwilling accomplices in the power elite’s drive for global control. Because, inorder to control the world, the power elite must conquer the public mind. And asWalter Lippmann reminds us, “News and the truth are not the same thing…”Wikileaks and the Role of the Corporate MediaLet’s have a look at one very recent example of media manipulation. Wikileaks.Wikileaks was started up in December of 2006. Wouldn’t you say it was ratherstrange how an alleged upstart ‘leak’ site, was given star-studded attentionfrom corporate media such as the Washington Post and Time magazine? What’s more,Time magazine immediate did a lot more than give credibility to Wikileaks bygiving the audience tips on how best to decipher the site in such a way thatseemed eerily familiar to George W. Bush’s rhetoric immediately after 9/11.This is what Time magaizine had to say about it in January 2007. “By March, morethan one million leaked documents from governments and corporations in Asia, theMiddle East, sub-Saharan Africa and the former Soviet Bloc will be availableonline in a bold new collective experiment in whistle-blowing. That is, ofcourse, as long as you don’t accept any of the conspiracy theories brewing thatWikileaks.org could be a front for the CIA or some other intelligence agency.”52What makes this whole thing so incomprehensible is that the Time article waswritten before Wikileaks’ first big “leak,” in March of 2007. Why would Timeeven mention them if Wikileaks were two months away from their coming out party?Why would they expose themselves in such a risky way, unless of course they knowsomething we don´t. Are we to believe that Time magazine, an establishementmedia, would independently praise an alleged anti-establishment leak site which,in the near future will expose all kinds of “conspiracy theories” while at thesame time telling its audience that these conspiracy theories circulating on theweb are all crazy? Just so long as you believe the “correct” conspiracytheories, you’ll be all right I guess.Now, read the following from Time magazine. “Instead of a couple of academicspecialists, Wikileaks will provide a forum for the entire global community toexamine any document relentlessly for credibility, plausibility, veracity andfalsifiability,” its organizers write on the site’s FAQ page.53 “They will beable to interpret documents and explain their relevance to the public. If adocument is leaked from the Chinese government, the entire Chinese dissidentcommunity can freely scrutinize and discuss it… ”54 Does this sound like apublic relations propaganda piece written by the boys at Madison Avenue?Sounds like a Wikileaks “How To” guide. Please understand you are being toldwhat to think and how to interpret the information. Of course, in order tointerpret it “correctly” you must have the right mindset. But, in order to getthe unsuspecting public into the right mindset, Wikileaks needed the officialblessing of the leading mainstream corporate media publications. Without thepublic’s support, this little project looked doomed to fail before it even gotoff the ground. Is that why you had Ruppert Murdoch’s public relations guy onthe board of directors of Wikileaks? Is that the reason both Time magazine andthe Washington Post had to come out with supportive articles about Wikileaksbefore anyone knew anything about them?Please understand, mainstream news limits your understanding of the world bywhat it chooses not to report and ignore.POLLING BY NUMBERSIn the early 20th Century, the words “propaganda” and “war” became synonymouswith one another. This was no accident. It was all part of the effort toundermine the Judeo-Christian legacy through an ‘abolition of culture.’ Two menshowed how to link the concepts of propaganda and war into one technique. Onewas Walter Lippmann, one of the most influential of political commentators ofhis time. It was Lippmann who in 1922 gave us the concept of “stereotype,” whichwas basically a continuation of the Jungian concept of the archtype by othermeans. Stereotypes can be created, and manipulated, by the gurus of masscommunication and psychological warfare. The idea is not to make the targetthink too clearly or too profoundly about the images received but instead toreact, in a Pavlovian manner, to the stimulus it provides.The other was Edward Bernays, Freud’s nephew and one of the founders of publicopinion manipulation techniques. In Bernays’ own words: “It was, of course, theastounding success of propaganda during the [First World] war that opened theeyes of the intelligent few in all departments of life to the possibilities ofregimenting the public mind….We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastesformed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. Whateverattitude one chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that inalmost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics orbusiness, our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by arelatively small number of persons, a trifling fraction of our hundred andtwenty million [U.S. citizens at the time], who understand the mental processesand social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires, which controlthe public mind, and who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bindand guide the world.”55During WWI, as a young lad, Bernays served on the U. S. Committee on PublicInformation (CPI), an ingeniously named American propaganda apparatus mobilizedby the U.S. government in 1917 to sell the wonders of ‘righteous’ war to theunaware population as one that would ‘Make the World Safe for Democracy.’ Eventhough millions were killed on the battlefields of Europe, there was hardly anyresistance to the carnage. By 1917, shortly before the U.S. entered the war, 94%of the British working class, an overwhelming majority of those who perished onthe battlefields of Europe in the name of their King, had no idea what they werefighting for, other than the distorted image generated by the corporate media ofthe time that the Germans wanted to kill their King and destroy their country.Every war since then, including the current “war on terror,” has used identicalmass communications propaganda techniques.“The manipulators then played upon this to undermine and distract the grasp ofreality governing any given situation and, the more complex the problems of amodern industrial society became, the easier it became to bring greater andgreater distractions to bear so that what we ended up with was that theabsolutely inconsequential opinions of masses of people, created by skilledmanipulators, assumed the position of scientific fact.”56Today, public opinion polls are completely intertwined with current affairstelevision shows that offer the public ready-made McNews items in easy toswallow bite-size pieces. A ‘scientific survey’ of what people are said to thinkabout an issue can be produced in less than twenty-four hours. Most of the pollsannounced by the world’s leading media groups, such as CBS-NBC-ABC-CNN-Fox, theNew York Times, the Washington Post, Time, Newsweek, Financial Times, WallStreet Journal in fact are co-ordinated at the National Opinion Research Centerwhere, as much as it will amaze most people, a psychological profile wasdeveloped for every nation on Earth.The idea of ‘public opinion’ is not new, of course. Plato warned against it inhis Republic over two thousand years ago as did Alexis de Tocqueville on itsinfluence over America in the early 19th century. But, until the 1930’s, no onethought of using it to sway the masses towards a particular vision fordecision-making.As Michael Minnicino explains at length, “The belief that public opinion can bea determinant of truth is philosophically insane. It precludes the idea of therational individual mind. Every individual mind contains the divine spark ofreason, and is thus capable of scientific discovery, and understanding thediscoveries of others. The individual mind is one of the few things that cannot,therefore, be ‘averaged.’ Consider: at the moment of creative discovery, it ispossible, if not probable, that the scientist making the discovery is the onlyperson to hold that opinion about nature, whereas everyone else has a differentopinion, or no opinion. One can only imagine what a “scientifically-conductedsurvey” on Kepler’s model of the solar system would have been, shortly after hepublished the Harmony of the World: 2% for, 48% against, 50% no opinion.“Despite its unprovable central thesis of “psychoanalytic types,” theinterpretive survey methodology of the Frankfurt School became dominant in thesocial sciences and essentially remains so today. In fact, the adoption of thesenew, supposedly scientific techniques in the 1930’s brought about an explosionin public-opinion survey use, much of it funded by Madison Avenue.”57 That’sbecause opinions can be easily counted. You can ask a group of people how they‘feel’ about something or whether they think that such and such a statement istrue. You add the ‘yes’ and subtract the ‘no’ with the larger number becomingthe consensus, which apparently represent the opinion of the ‘majority.’ Thus,“America is saying NO to drugs” is a manufactured consent by the pollsters onbehalf of the financial elite, who are in fact, the world’s biggest drug pushersas I have repeatedly shown in all my books. But, no matter how many people agreeor disagree with something, it doesn’t make it true. After studying Americanpolling numbers, Emery and Trist have come to a conclusion that “people behaveaccording to consensus.” The masses of great unwashed, are so directed andinfluenced by the polls that “they wouldn´t dare break this social contract:they must do what others perceive that they should do; to do otherwise wouldcause psychological pain.” They conclude that polls, “give meaning to theirlives.”58After World War II, Paul Lazarsfeld, the director of the Bureau of AppliedSocial Research at Columbia University and who especially pioneered the use ofsurveys to psychoanalyze American voting behaviour, and by the 1952 Presidentialelection along with Madison Avenue advertising agencies were firmly in controlof Dwight Eisenhower’s campaign, utilising Lazarsfeld’s work. The power oftelevision and its hypnotic influence on the electorate became a reality in the1952 elections. “Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborne – the fabled ‘BBD&O’ adagency – designed Ike’s campaign appearances entirely for the TV cameras, and ascarefully as Hitler’s Nuremberg rallies; one-minute ‘spot’ advertisements werepioneered to cater to the survey-determined needs of the voters.“This snowball has not stopped rolling since. The entire development oftelevision and advertising in the 1950’s and 1960’s was pioneered by men andwomen who were trained in the Frankfurt School’s techniques of mass alienation.Frank Stanton went directly from the Radio Project to become the singlemost-important leader of modern television.”59The whole idea behind this type of ‘social brainwashing’ is to better understandthe electorate’s response to policy dictates of the elite. “If you want peopleto believe something, then all you have to do is get a poll taken that says thatit is so and get it publicized, preferably on television.” The speaker is HalBecker of the Future’s Group.We are elite’s test cases, to be nudged and prodded in the right directions, allalong making us believe that our decisions are based on our solid understandingof the body-politics around us, whereas in reality, we are a ‘targetedpopulation groups’ whose messages are adjusted to the apparent needs of themasses. The results of the carefully constructed polls, fed back to thepopulation through the mass media, provide the basis for shaping opinion. Thisprocess is created at Tavistock and described in one of the Tavistock manuals as“the message reaching the sense organs of persons to be influenced.”It was this juggernaut that transformed most Americans who had never heard ofSaddam Hussein and could never dream of showing you Iraq on a map, into a viledemonstration of hatred for an unknown ‘enemy’, who, we were told, wanted tokill our President and exterminate us as a country. Sound familiar?How could this be, you ask? Because these images of Saddam, world enemy numberone became an image of evil through the power of television. Just as Hitler andStalin visually represented evil. How about a little test? Who, in your opinion,is the enemy today? Putin? Or is it your fellow man? We have become the enemy,the source of destruction of society. If you believe the evil Freud, “not allmen are worthy of love.” The sinister environmentalist movement with theiranti-human view of man explicitly states this very fact in their degeneratepropaganda. “Save the little animals. Kill the people.”Still, we don’t seem to get it. Why?Because the methodology of polling hasn’t changed since its inception.Complicated issues are reduced to simple sets of choices. [Saddam Hussein is abad man. Do you agree?] However, what is this assertion based on? On whosevision? How do you define badness? From the perspective of Iraqi’s population,the invading U.S. troops were bad and Saddam was good. These types of questionsfit directly into the profile of Western Europe and North America: “Keep itsimple, stupid.”We are talking about Freudian mass psychology and its appeal to infantilist,animal-like behaviour, the touchy-feelie thing, designed to bypass creativereasoning powers of every individual, informed by moral judgement and theeternal search for universal Truth.In fact, when it comes to television, the issue of truth has never, in fact,been an issue. Television is not about the ‘truth,’ it is about creatingreality. It does not matter one bit whether the images you see on television arereal or copied and pasted from past events, because people believe them to bereal, immediate and thus true. For example, in the March 2010 earthquake inJapan, mass media showed images of empty supermarket shelves stating brazenlythat Japan was undergoing the worst water rationing since World War II. However,the images of empty shelves were taken from stock photography and had little todo with the earthquake or lack of bottled water. In this way, reality, asconveyed by the nightly news, obliterates Truth every night. Emery and Tristindicated that “the more a person watches television, the less he understands,the more he accepts, the more he becomes dissociated from his own thoughtprocess... television is much more magical than any other consumer productbecause it makes things normal, it packages and homogenises fragmentary aspectsof reality. It constructs an acceptable reality (the myth) out of largelyunacceptable ingredients. To confront the myth would be to admit that one wasineffective, isolated and incapable... It (television images) becomes and is thetruth.”In this manner, the nightly stories on your favourite television news show serveto reinforce your opinion of what the world around you looks and smells like.And what is that opinion? That we live in a world of unspeakable violence andperversion; that human beings are degrading and violent creatures who murder,rape, destroy and spread hatred everywhere they go in the name of whatever –ismhappens to be in vogue at the moment.IDIOTSPEAKHave you ever paid attention to the level of language used in newscasts? Youhaven´t, have you? In fact, every newscast in the western world follows the samelanguage pattern: simple verbs, oodles of nouns and very few long sentences.Short sentences, simple vocabulary. In other words, sound bites. “Presidentwon´t run for re-election,” says the newsreader, “details in half an hour.” Thistoo, is deliberate. Through language, its beauty and complexity, “mancommunicates the ideas and principles of his culture from one generation to thenext.”60 The language of television is Aristotelian, through the mere naming ofobjects, as in a fixed, counted universe: Man, dog, criminal, president, carbomb, economy, bad, good. “There is no creative thought going on, no attempt toengage the mind, merely to imprint an image in a person’s brain.”61 And that’swhat you call brainwashing. However, brainwashing by television is not anovernight thing, rather it is a cumulative effect over a long period of timethat succeeds in changing the paradigm of our society. Don´t believe me? Lookaround and think back a generation.The language of television news has its roots in linguistic work during WorldWar II as part of H.G. Wells’ Ultimate Revolution; the elimination of allnational languages in favour of ‘Basic English’, future world language, whichhad a vocabulary of only 850 words. This degenerate concept was created by aBritish linguist, C.K. Ogden. Some people in the highest levels of the Britisholigarchy, including Churchill, saw the potential brainwashing value in whatOgden had done. By using ‘Basic,’ coupled with the mass media, a large number ofpeople could be given a simple message without complicated thoughts getting inthe way.In Wells’ future world: “The English most speak and write today is verydifferent from the English of Shakespeare, Addison, Bunyan or Shaw: it has shedthe last traces of such archaic elaborations as the subjunctive mood.”However, human powers of hypothesis and creative reason become a force forimprovements in the order of nature, and thus cannot be encased into an 850 wordvocabulary. Through languages, nation states were given meaning and through themour quest for Truth. In ancient Greece, in Plato’s Meno dialogue, “Socratesbrings out the innate genius in the slave boy, by encouraging him to solve theproblem of doubling the square. He thus proves that slavery is unjust, byshowing the creative nature of the human species. Plato’s pro-imperial opponentAristotle, assuming that man has no soul, declared that nature has destined someto be slaves, and has made others their masters.”62Tavistock knows that ideas are more powerful than any standing army. To getpeople to accept their imperial ideas, Tavistock seeks to control the way peoplethink, especially science, the area where human powers of hypothesis andcreative reason become a force for improvements in the order of nature. If youcan control how we think, you control how we respond to events around us, nomatter what these events might be. This process is called ‘paradigm shift,’ anoverturning of existing sets of assumptions about society.Historically, the fight to preserve language as the cornerstone of nation-staterepublics goes back to Italian playwright, Dante Alighieri.As sociologist Dennis Speed writes on the pages of Fidelio Magazine, “It isimportant to identify the fact that the people of the Italian Renaissance spokea language that did not exist two hundred years earlier, but was invented by thepoet Dante Alighieri. Dante, who lived from 1250 to the early 1300s’, struggledto invent a language that could resurrect the most profound ideas of humanthought even if his own era should ultimately commit suicide. This suicide, infact, did occur through the banking collapse caused by the Bardi and Peruzzifamilies.“Without Dante’s gift of the Italian language, which was shaped by him from overa thousand local dialects, there could not have occurred the Renaissance.Dante’s Divine Comedy refined the canto form of sung poetry. His followers,Francesco Petrarca, sought to advance language further with the invention of thesoneto or sonnet. But, Petrarca’s friend Giovanni Boccaccion was assigned byPetrarca to a different project, called the Decameron. The Decameron was writtenin order to prevent the whole of Italian society from sinking into culturalpessimism and dying out during the Black Death of the 1340’s and later. Itconsists of satirical stories, many quite risqué, which recount the tragedy ofEurope’s suicide in a way designed to make people laugh at themselves and repeatthe stories, and hopefully not the behaviour which had destroyed them. Thus,they would learn Dante’s Italian.“Geoffrey Chaucer, attended a lecture by Boccaccio on Dante in 1375, and got theidea to do the same thing in English. Thus was born The Canterbury Tales, whichrecount the hilarious tales told on a religious pilgrimage to the church ofCanterbury. The English, being every bit as licentious as the Italians, alsorepeated the stories and thus learned how to speak English. Later, Shakespeareimported the sonnet of Petrarca into English. Your literate English, is in largemeasure Italian, a sort of grandson of Dante’s Italian. Later, the Christianhumanist figure Erasmus of Rotterdam inspired his student, Francois Rabelais, todo for France what was done by Boccaccio for Italy and Chaucer for English. Thuswas born the astounding character Gargantua and with it, the French language.And in Spanish, we have the great example of Don Quixote.”63In this way, languages, created by poets, lifted the populations that had beendominated by ignorance and thereby ruled over. In fact, the languages createdthe nations, not the other way around.WAR ACROSS GENERATIONAL DIVIDEPeople in their sixties are called the Baby-Boom generation. The values commonto the Baby Boomer generation are synonymous with the paradigm shift in societybeginning with the 1960s. That policy change is de-industrialization of America.De-industrialization society is a no-future society because any self-respectingnation-state can only be truly independent if it can provide welfare for itscitizens. How were the people who run the world able to impose thisde-industrialization on society? Think about the profile of the Americanpopulation.The generation with the strongest set of moral values in American history is thegeneration that fought in World War II. They were born before the advent oftelevision. They were the hardest generation to brainwash. Their children, thebaby boomers, became the targets of the brainwashers. In fact, with the adventof television, the baby boomers have spent their entire lives being brainwashed.Think back to the goal of brainwashers: to make each succeeding generation moreinfantile, more animal-like, more amoral, thus easier to control. The world weare part of today is more conventional, less concerned, more sensationalist andmore spiteful. The impetus of modern thought has been towards reducing thesphere of individual moral responsibility. Human behavior is seen increasinglyas the product of impersonal forces.And how could it be different? Our parents were brought up on a ‘healthy’ doseof television diet. We were also reared by television. Our children are educatedthrough mainstream TV. In other words, three successive generations subjected totelevision brainwashing, have no conscious memory of anything different.Think about it. People have never quite digested television. The mystique whichshould grow stale grows stronger. Our moral compass has shifted to such anextent that we make celebrities not only of the men who cause the events but ofthe men who act them out on the screen, who lipsync old songs for hand-pickedstudio audience and of those out-of-work actors who sell cheap trinkets, yogurtsand deodorants during commercial breaks of old film re-runs.And once our moral compass shifted something happened to us and with us. The TVset became the moralizer. It began telling people what to do. Suddenly, thebehavior of the children – the drugs, the sex, the anti-social behavior doesn´tseem as shocking as it once did. It became easier to rationalize it, to explainit away with the help of the messages contained in television programming. “Andwhen the adults are infantile already, it is more easy to accept the infantilismin their children.”CULTURAL WARFARENow, let’s have a look at the people who create the idea content of thebrainwashing. Most of them are in the approximately 35-45 year old range. Inother words, the programmers themselves were weaned on television since birth!So, don’t look for a scenario where three 90-year-old geezers sit in a darkroom, holding hands, staring at a crystal ball, planning the world’s future. Itdoesn’t work that way. It is more like a group of infantile jerks in sneakersand goofy haircuts, sitting around in an air-conditioned room overlooking theBig Apple, kicking around ideas for next year’s major shows.Once they come up with the ideas, they pass it on to another group of infantilejerks called scriptwriters who will put these ideas into simple dialogues fullof nouns and simple verbs. That product will then be placed in the hands ofproducers and directors for actual production. This is done the world over, fromthe United States to Canada and Western Europe. Even thousand-year-old orientalcultures, such as the Japanese, have their own versions of all major and minorU.S. hit situation comedies, adapted to their own market.Once the shows are designed and the scripts written, the actual brainwashingmessages are inserted after the fact. The jerky screenwriters and brainstormersrely on “experts” from Tavistock and Frankfurt School who work as “advisers” onmost programs. For example, “there can be no discussion of homosexuals withoutfirst deferring to the ‘Gay Rights Task Force’ who make sure that the issue isbeing dealt with ‘sensitively.’ Similarly, all children shows and that includesall Disney programming employ child psychiatrists who help shape content.”Furthermore, the entire environmental idiocy is scripted into television shows,films and into the news.Take, for example, a 2008 Hollywood science fiction thriller, The Happening,starring Mark Wahlberg, that “follows a man, his wife, and his best friend alongwith his friend’s daughter, as they try to escape from an inexplicable naturaldisaster. The plot revolves around a mysterious neurotoxin that causes anyoneexposed to it to commit suicide.”64 The message is easily discernible. Peopleare the enemy of nature and Planet Earth is rebelling against us, ruthlesslykilling the enemy.Those who protest and are opposed to such idiocy are shunned and scorned bytheir co-workers, friends and family. If you weren’t completely won over, youbecame tolerant or at the very least, you kept your mouth shut as the lonelyvoice of reason. Isn´t that right?The New York-Hollywood social community of ‘creative’ people function in whatbrainwashers call a leaderless group: “They are unaware of the real outsideforces that control them, especially unaware of their own brainwashing by 30-40years television viewing. They believe themselves free to create, but they canlawfully only produce banalities. Ultimately, these creators of our televisionprogramming turn to their own brainwashing experience and values for their‘creative inspiration.’”65 When one producer was asked how he determined whatwas in his shows, he replied, “I think of myself as the audience. If it pleasesme – I always think that it is going to please the audience.” Indeed it does.How many people who watch television are aware that what they see on the boobtube reflects the morals and conscience of the people who make them happen?Let’s have a look at the two most ‘popular’ television shows to have garnered asmuch attention in the past decade as Operacion Triunfo y Gran Hermano [BigBrother]. Why are they so popular? One might suspect the content itself – astartling new idea, but the reason might also be social acceptability, or evenjust plain hype. Each of these programs, with their claims of righteousgenerosity, even-handedness and ratings measured fun, contains no new argumentsand presents no compelling reasons why the studio audience, the show’sparticipants and all those simple folks watching at home shouldn’t be locked upin perpetuity.By any standard, Operacion Triunfo is an impressive achievement, a culturalprototype for the gullible and the sick. Their participants are better looking,slicker, more calculating, more diabolical, more astute in optimum crowdmanipulation than their predecessors – a triumphantly bizarre television‘celebrity’ moment of puerile distortionism.Television, in fact, has given status to the “celebrity” which few real menattain. And what is a “celebrity” if not the ultimate human pseudo-event,fabricated on purpose to satisfy our exaggerated expectations of humangreatness. This is the ultimate success story of the twenty-first century andits pursuit of illusion. A new mold of human emptiness has been made, so thatmarketable human models – modern ‘heroes’, could be mass-produced, to satisfythe market, and without any hitches.The world we have been peering into is somehow beyond good and evil. It is aworld of sentimentality, of makeovers, of people who are willing to shed a tearjust before a commercial break, and then return with uplifting visions of a lifewith family by show’s end.It is a world of post-baby boom, post-paradigm shift and post-reality. It is aworld of us versus them, of our parents generation against our generation. Andthe divide could not have been greater than it is today. “Bridging the twogenerational value structures, was the television set in your living room. Andwhat did it tell you: to compromise, to learn to speak to each other. Itprovided you with solace, as your world collapsed and changed.”66Then, there is Big Brother. There are those who argue that each show is a smallmorality play, with the audience booing the villain and supporting the goodguests. The show insists on as much – the tone, a throwback to the time-testedmodel of the past, is almost always conspiratorial. The nincompoops are moreself-righteous, more vehement, and more paranoid. Instead of saying indefensiblethings and trusting that the viewer will love him anyway, they explain theirhardships and plead their case, which is a very unreasonable thing to do with anabjectly stupid audience. I find it disturbing to see people allowing themselvesto be used like Kleenex for shallow ends. Initial triumphalism, giving way togrudgy defeatism – is today’s World as seen through the prismatic binoculars ofan intrusively globalized, theraupeutized and Coca-Cola-ized American morality.“Attacking the entertainment of a therapeutic culture is a way of attacking itsvalues: publicity over achievement, revelation over restraint, honesty overdecency, victimhood over personal responsibility, confrontation over civility,psychology over morality.”67 According to a well-informed source at TVE, themore intellectual you make the shows, the more the viewers yawn and go away. Butthen, we already know that. And why should we be surprised? In this society,shame is fame and sin is an instrument of upward mobility. And upward mobilityis the modern way.In Webster’s English Dictionary, fame is defined as “the frenzy of renown.” Thefrenzied, meaning people who are intoxicated by synthetic significance – arecomplicit in this farce. Forty years ago, in his book The Image, Daniel Boorstinargued that the graphic revolution in television had severed fame from greatnesswhich generally required a gestation period in which great deeds were performed.This severance hastened the decay of fame into mere notoriety, which is veryplastic and very perishable.The doctrine of “celebrity” triumphalism is inherently inclusive; it proceedsfrom the assumption that everyone already loves the wealthy and thepseudo-famous. Most pseudo “celebrities” seems to have understood that theirlife is a constant conjuring trick. There is an incurable precariousness totheir position as they try to live off derivative dignity from an anachronisticconcept while cultivating the royalism of a democratic age – celebrity.That assumption is what makes the celebrity circus so creepy. The pseudo-famousknow that they owe their careers to the celebrity industry, know that theirtabloid sensibility is well suited to a tabloid culture, know that the wholeenterprise is built on bad faith. Still, the ratings continue to climb... .We have always had a voyeuristic streak. Ours has always been a culture ofgawkers. We went to see the bearded lady and the albino man when the circus cameto town. But now we want to be a part of the circus – the bearded lady and thealbino man rolled into one. And it may be just the right thing for the currentmoment, in which the sleazy patter of tabloid culture has given way to jitteryonslaughts of bearded midgets and six-foot tall offsprings and guaranteed toappeal to the intellectually challenged (reason being highly optional). Theabnormal is normal, and deviancy will be back right after the commercial.Disturbing as I find the anachronism of the Variety shows, I am even moredistressed by their pervasive disingenuousness. The hosts and the guests alikeomit facts, misuse words, and seem unwilling to admit the consequences of theirown actions. I have never seen anything more grotesquely inadequate in a way ofconfession.As Maureen Dowd writes in the New York Times, “Confession began in a small darkbox, with a screen separating priest and penitent. It is still in a small darkbox, and there is still a screen, but this one is in everyone’s living room. Inthe new medium of confession, people violate their own privacy, spilling theirguts not for absolution but for syndication.”68In fact, we are living in a world where conspicuousness passes for distinction,and the society column has become the roll of fame...André Malraux believed that the third millennium must be the age of religion. Iwould say rather that it must be the age in which we finally grow out of ourneed for religion. But to cease to believe in our gods is not the same thing ascommencing to believe in nothing. To believe, we must take on the richness of aman, his existential density, immortality, eternity and not the sectarian,simplistic, visceral millenarianism. Memory saves people from oblivion. Theinherent danger, however, is that the prerequisite is lacking: curiosityderiving from respect for deeply alien cultures.That is not the main lesson of what is happening today, but it is a cruciallesson. The public debate increasingly is in the hands of the mentally retarded.This degeneration has played a large role in a paradigm shift of our society.What is that shift, again? Man is to be told that he is a beast, so that hemight be controlled like one. The brainwashers of Tavistock adopted a bestialview that the human mind is simply a blank slate, which avoids pain and seekspleasure. “It was from this standpoint that the Tavistock Institute developedits peculiar techniques for creating a mass psychology.”69TELEVISION’S HIDDEN MESSAGESIn a 1944 report, Theodore Adorno, one of Frankfurt School’s premier thinkers,postulated that media such as radio and especially television could be used tomake people “forcibly retarded.” Listen to his words: “Television aims at thesynthesis of radio and film, and is held up only because the interested partieshave not yet reached agreement, but its consequences will be quite enormous andpromise to intensify the impoverishment of asethetic matter so drastically...”Twelve years later, Adorno wrote that “television is a medium of undreamedpsychological control.” In his ground-breaking essay “Television and thePatterns of Mass Culture,” Adorno writes, “...investigative systematicallysocio-psychological stimuli typical of televised material on both thedescriptive and psychodynamic levels, to analyse their presuppositions, as wellas their total pattern, and to evaluate the effect they are likely to produce.This procedure may ultimately bring forth a number of recommendations on how todeal with these stimuli to produce the most desirable effect…”70 Adorno statesthat “all television programming contains overt messages as defined by the plot,characters, etc and a hidden message,” far less obvious. These hidden messagesin themselves are the brainwashing content, while “the overt message, such asthe plot are the carriers of that brainwashing content.”71Here is a bit on Lonnie Wolfe’s write up of Adorno’s message: “Our Miss Brooks,a popular situation comedy pitted a trained professional, a school teacher,against her boss, the principal. Most of the humour, according to Adorno, wasderived from situations in which the under-paid teacher tried to hustle a mealfrom her friends. Adorno ‘decodes’ the hidden message as follows. ‘If you arehumorous, good-natured, quick-witted, and charming as Miss Brooks is, do notworry about being paid a starving wage. You can cope with your frustration in ahumorous way and your superior wit and cleverness put you not only abovematerial privations, but also above the rest of mankind.’ This message will becalled forth years later, as the economy collapses in the form of a “cynicalanti-materialism.” It came forth with a vengeance among the 1960s ‘lostgeneration’ and the first wave of counterculture.”72 If we are to extrapolatethis, the more confusing life becomes, the “more people cling desperately toclichés to bring order to the otherwise un-understandable,” Adorno writes.In one of his other reflections, Adorno predicted that the “creative sissy willfind an important place in society.” Several shows featured characters who wereartistic, sensitive and effeminate males. “Such images cohered with Freudiannotions that artistic creativity stemmed from either a repressed or actualhomosexual passion. These effeminate, sensitive males usually come up againstthe other more, aggressive male ‘macho’ images, such as cowboys, who areuncreative.”73ANIMAL KINGDOM AND USAnother key area of brainwashing is the creating of identity between man and theanimal. From children’s cartoons to television shows and major motion picturesportrayed animals acting like they were human beings. Over time, according tostudies, kids lost their ability to differentiate between most animals and humanlife. Format shows such as Lassie, the animal was a ‘hero’ who often defeatedsingle-handedly ‘bad’ people who wanted to hurt Lassie’s child friends. “All ofthis identification with the animal, and the blurring of the distinction betweenwhat is human and what is animal played back a generation later in the lunacy ofthe environmental movement.”74But even before there was television, another mass media phenomenonpreconditioned young people for the non-rational, audio-visual experience: theWalt Disney full-length feature cartoons such as Snow White, Cinderella,Sleeping Beauty, Pinocchio, and more recently Little Mermaid and Beauty and theBeast. Without ever realizing it, adults and children alike have been subjectedto over 60 years of some of the most vile and pernicious propaganda in modernhistory. “These feature length cartoons were aimed at becoming universalexperiences for generations of children and their parents, containing moralmessages that would stay with a child through most of his adult life.”75What few people realize is that both Walt Disney and his brother were producingWWII propaganda films, managed by the Committee for Morale. “Disney cartoonswere not to make people think, but to feel, something that Disney said, “wouldunify his audience of parents and children at an emotionally infantile level.”76Disney and the degenerates at Frankfurt School and Tavistock are on the samepage here, with people such as Adorno who spoke of using the media and its powerto convey emotion-laden images to force a retardation of adult society. Thuspictures and sound were to create a mental image that would seem real, to givehis characters an emotional dimension. In such a dream-like state, people weremore willing to accept the vivid imagery of his cartoons as real. Listen toDisney and if you are a human being instead of a two-legged animal, his wordsshould make you sick to your stomach: If all the world thought and acted likechildren, we’d never have any trouble. The pity is that even kids have to growup.Without realizing it, you are being bombarded with an ultra-heavy dose of someof the vilest Jungian symbolism through the mass entertainment media, “creatingmythological worlds of ‘superheroes’ and ‘supervillains,’ while introducingcharacter representation of archtypes such as the ‘Great Mother’ or the ‘WiseOld Man’ or the ‘Maiden’ or the ‘Eternal Youth.’ This was no coincidence as thelargest concentration of Jungians in the United States continues to be inHollywood where numbers of producers, directors, screenwriters, actors andactresses underwent Jungian ‘dream therapy.’“In addition, musicians, lyricists and other components of the rock scene,influenced by the LSD experience, gravitated toward Jungian thought, andinserted his symbolism into their songs. Nowhere are there sharperrepresentations of Jungian archtypes than Disney cartoons. His cartoonrepresentations were totally coherent with Jungian concepts, especially hisconsistent presentation of morality in the absence of the teachings of theJudeo-Christian concept of the Good. To the extent that good triumphs, it doesso only through the intervention of magical powers of fairies which are morepowerful than evil. This is the essence of the kind of spirituality which Jungspeaks of – the symbolic fight between ‘dark’ and ‘light’ forces, outside thecontrol of human reason.”77But there is a scarier aspect of the entire Disney circus, with its grizzly dipinto the macabre. For the past 60 years, one of the most popular children’sshows has been the Mickey Mouse Club with its synthetic mix of real people, livemusic, cartoons and live interaction between humans and people dressed up asanimal characters. How many people realize that the Mickey Mouse Club was asinister experiment in mass brainwashing of children through television? Eachchild at home was ‘indoctrinated’ in a membership ritual, with prompting fromthe television, and was urged to singalong with words flashed on the screen andchant things as instructed by their television group leader. They did so whilewearing their ‘mouse ears,’ which were designed to make them identify with theanimal figure, Mickey Mouse. At the end of the show, there was a sermon by agroup leader, a young male adult, whose preaching was reinforced from thein-studio Mouseketeers. All of this done while children at home and on the stagewore their ears and gave their ‘club salute.’ How many people realize that whilethey were giving their Mouseketeer salute, they were actually being fed a newpagan-like religion, and its newly installed god, the mouse?If you extrapolate it a bit further, parents stepped aside and allowed a mouse,or rather television, through a Mickey Mouse, to give values to a generation ofchildren who would teach the same values, in most cases to their children andtheir children’s children. I repeat, you are looking at three successivegenerations subjected to television brainwashing, without any conscious memoryof anything different. In another time and in another European country, anothergeneration of children was given values to them in an organized form by someoneother than their parents. “The Hitler Youth of Nazi Germany. They too had theirrituals, their uniforms and symbols, and their songs. They too had theirleaders, who preached sermons. They too were told to listen to their parents andbe patriotic, polite and well-behaved.”78 The trick was to make the Nazisdisappear, but not their ideals. Nazism yes, but without its modicum. MickeyMouse and Hitler. Can you see a parallel?THE INVISIBLE EMPIREWith all this talk about Dante and Disney, Mickey Mouse and paradigm shift,Judeo-Christian culture and Aristotle, Freud and Jung, Tavistock and FrankfurtSchool, you might have forgotten the main theme of this chapter. Let’s haveEduard Bernays, Freud’s nephew, tell it like it is: “The conscious andintelligent manipulation of the organized habits and the masses is an importantelement in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism ofsociety constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power inthis country... we are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes are formed,our ideas suggested largely by men we have never heard of... Our invisiblegovernors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members ofthe inner cabinet... Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward thiscondition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives,whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or ethicalthinking, we are dominated by a relatively small number of persons...whounderstand the mental processes and social practices of the masses. It is theywho pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness the social forcesand contrive new ways to bind and guide the world.”79 Can anyone in their rightmind, still deny it? Can anyone deny that there has been a mind-bogglingparadigm shift in our moral values in the past two generations? Look around you!Someone is doing this from behind the scenes – or is it still not clear!Now that we have settled the question of Mickey Mouse, let’s have a look atanother all-time children’s favourite – Sesame Street. The goal of the showconceived in 1966 was “to master the addictive qualities of television and dosomething good with them, such as helping young children prepare for school.”80The first thing a child sees is a show dominated by animal-like creatures withhuman characteristics, the famous Muppets. Before we get into the brainwashingaspect of it, I would like you to listen to one of the Tavistock poster boys –Malcolm Gladwell. In his own words: “Sesame Street was built around a single,breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you caneducate them.”81 Sesame Street, according to Wikipedia, “was the firstchildren’s show that structured each episode and made, as Gladwell put it,‘small but critical adjustments’82 to each segment to capture children’sattention. After Sesame Street’s first season, its critics forced its producersand researchers to address affective goals more overtly. The affective goalsthey addressed were social competence, tolerance of diversity, andnon-aggressive ways of resolving conflict, environmentalism, which was depictedthrough interpersonal disputes among its residents.’”83That’s one of the hidden messages. Do you see? Sesame Street preaches itspersonal brand of degeneracy by having beastly Muppets openly moralise about theenvironmental issues, social competence, tolerance and more. Another hiddenmessage is that the ‘only’ correct solution, no matter the problem, wascompromise, to learn toleration. All of this is done while the Muppets teach thechildren to read and write. But there can never be compromise with evil, forthose who hold universal Truth as their ultimate objective in life. That’s partof moral rectitude and character that defined all great nations and people ofideals.“Shortly after creating Sesame Street, its producers began to develop what cameto be called “the CTW model,” a system of planning, production, and evaluationthat did not fully emerge until the end of the show’s first season.84 The CTWmodel consisted of four parts: ‘the interaction of receptive televisionproducers and child science experts, the creation of a specific andage-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, andindependent measurement of viewers’ learning.’”85But this is a big lie. Studies show that the show does not enhance learning; “inmany cases, it appears to inhibit their ability to understand more complicatedideas. More importantly, the studies indicate that the children appear‘addicted’ to the show, and by that ‘addiction’ to become addicted to televisionviewing in general.”86 As Neil Postman, a New York University professor wrote inhis book Amusing Ourselves to Death, “If we are to blame Sesame Street foranything, it is the pretence that it is an ally of the classroom...Sesame Streetdoes not encourage children to love school or anything about school. Itencourages children to love television.”There is absolutely no question that Sesame Street is about as Establishment asyou can get. Its money came from the Rockefeller controlled Carnegie Foundationand Ford Foundation who have pushed the Sesame product into a global network.Ford Foundation money comes from the Central Intelligence Agency, hardly aparagon of child education; David Rockefeller-controlled Trilateral Commission,Council on Foreign Relations, Carlyle Group whose members include formerPresident George W. Bush, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, not tomention some of the lesser known members of the bin Laden family and Skull &Bones Yale University secret society. You didn’t know that, did you? The DavidRockefeller-controlled Carnegie Foundation is one of the key insiders in thepowerful Bilderberg Group who work diligently from behind the scenes to debasethe world’s education in order to bring us down to the level of culled humancattle.It is run as a business, and has always been so. It has never lost money andcontinues to rake in substantial profits, all in the name of child-basededucation. Children weaned on this garbage have helped make Sesame Street into a$1.5 billion industry, one that unlike the rest of the economy is expanding eachyear.You don’t agree? Let me ask you a question. Don´t you consider it odd that youryoung daughter wants to grow up and be just like Miss Piggy or Big Bird?THE MEDIA ERASERWhat about adult brainwashing? How do they get to us, the ‘big people’? One ofthe all time favourite Spanish television shows is Cuéntame Que Pasó (Tell MeWhat Happened). The show premiered on Spain’s public television on 13 September2001. The story begins in April 1968 and paints a day-to-day portrait ofFranco’s Spain through the adventures of a middle-class Alcantara of the 1960s,then the 1970s and into a modern democracy.So far, so good. However, does the show focus on the real horrors of the period?The drugs, the destruction, the collapse of social values, the changing paradigmof society? Not at all. Instead, we are treated to a daily diet of superficialboy loves girl thing, with television parents never succumbing to stress andcliché family quarrels. Franco’s death and subsequent changes are treated with akind of degrading moralism.Cuéntame Que Pasó is what’s called ‘controlled flashbacks’ for the baby boomers“to what they would now like to think the 1960s were like. By doing so, theproducers have put you in touch with the most infantile and banal emotions, andmade you feel nostalgic for them. The hidden message: in these difficult times,one had best cherish cling to memories and values of one’s infantile past. Thinkof television as a big eraser, wiping away your real memories of the past, thereality of the way things really were.”87 The tube superimposed a twisted anddistorted view of that reality through appeal, not to your mind, but to yourinfantile emotions. The idea of rewriting history through the use of media isnot new. But this is the first time that it is being done while the people wholived the history are still very much alive.THE WORLD OF ADVERTISINGTelevision is the most effective way to brainwash you, but it is not the onlyway. Madison Avenue in New York, the epiCentre of advertising, has alsocontributed their fair share, and by extension the ‘cult of celebrity,’ wouldplay a role in disseminating what Tavistock wanted you to believe. In the 1920s,Edward Bernays took peacetime propaganda and renamed it public relations.“Public Relations created the consumer society, which was said to be the cherryon the icing of the free market capitalism cake, with the introduction ofcelebrity endorsements and product placements.”88 PR consolidated the theoriesof mass psychology and schemes of corporate and political persuasion upon theaverage person’s beliefs by appealing ‘above the mind,’ directly to emotions andinstincts.“For more than 55 years now, people have been watching ads which, through theclever use of music and image, have attempted to manipulate subconscious drivesand instincts to sell products. Most run less than a minute, but containnumerous images and quite often a catchy jingle.”89 The formula is simple. Ifyou are a young person in western culture, advertising meet your informationneeds about growing up and living life. If you analyse it, there is virtually nodifference between a non-reasoning emotional appeal to watching television showsand watching television advertising. Both sell a point of view. No lectures. Nolessons. No right way or wrong way. It simply expresses, through the lifeexperiences of others, what life is or can be like for the target demographics.It’s very post-modern and very deceptive. Reality works, because it can be hypedas such, and manipulated.One point of view could easily be nostalgia. Nostalgia, as in Quéntame Que Pasó,is an interesting thing, acting as a common past that binds those of aparticular time or generation. When used correctly, nostalgia can also be veryhandy in manipulating people. Advertisers discovered this long ago, which may beone reason certain fashions and trends from the past three decades have made acomeback in the last ten years.For what appears in advertising today that creative, resourceful andunscrupulous people constantly try to discover what others value most – thenlook for some way to attach their product to the stars.By their very nature, no products can help us attain the ideals that arevisually promised, such as family togetherness, personal power, self-esteem,sociability, security, sex appeal and a clear orientation in an evermoreconfusing world.Advertising is the process of manufacturing glamour. The state of being enviedis what constitutes glamour. Advertising, then, is about the solitary happinessthat comes from being envied by others. But envy has a dark side which largelyhas been lost to twentieth century thought. Since medieval times, envy has beenconsidered the major term for identifying the causes of human suffering. Likedespair, envy derives from the separation of the person from the object ofdesire, combined with a sense that one is powerless to attain what is desired.In envy, the urge to reach out becomes the urge to destroy.And yet, at the heart of this hatred, lies the remarkable depth and simplicityof human longing – a longing for life, ideals, values, vitality and love. Alonging for connection. A longing for beauty. It is a longing that projectsitself optimistically through symbols, images and idealized concepts.Advertising is the consumer culture’s version of mythology. No society existswithout some form of myth. Thus, it is not very surprising that a society whichis based on the economy of mass production and mass consumption will evolve itsown myth in the form of a commercial. Like myth, it touches upon every facet oflife, and as a myth it makes use of the fabulous in its application to themundane.Why would the makers of commercials want to evoke hate and envy? In his book,Quest for Mind: Piaget, Levi-Strauss and the Structuralist Movement, comparingPiaget and Levi-Strauss, Howard Gardner wrote: “Myths are designed to deal withproblems of human existence which seem insoluble; they embody and express suchdilemmas in a coherently structured form, and so serve to render themintelligible. Through their structural similarity to given ‘real world’situations, myths establish a point of equilibrium at which men can come togrips with the crucial components of the problem. Thus a myth is bothintellectually satisfying and socially solidifying.”Commercials driven by value-laden images which are unrelated to the product maybe alienating us from the very values they exploit, confusing us about how toattain these values, laying the groundwork for despair, resentment and apathy.Because products do not provide the kind of psychic payoff promised by theimagery of advertising, we are left to doubt whether anything can. If we followthis doubt, we wind up contemplating a state of mind in which a black holesurrounds almost every product like a ghostly negative of its radiance – theblack hole of failed promise.And into this black hole, through advertising’s exploitation of so many idealimages, steps any religion that promises to cut through the cycle of idolatryand connect us with the one great ideal that trascends all others: God,immortality, cosmic foreverness, spiritualism, etc. Thus, in many respects,advertising has co-opted religion for its own purposes.That is a disturbing possibility; but another possibility is even moredisturbing. Could we be producing a generation that distrusts ideals altogether,because most powerful, convincing and forceful presentations of those idealsoccur on television commercials – where the ideals are prostituted in theservice of sales? Are we responsible for the creation of the most disillusionedgeneration in the history of mankind? A generation that will have difficulty nothating beauty of the kind used to manipulate and disappoint them in advertising?Worse still, will they also hate to be delicately overpowered by real beautywhen they encounter it in the world? Will people continue to be able to hope,have faith, set goals, and believe in something beyond themselves?Beauty has not always seemed so complicated. “From the times of the Greeks tothe early 20th century, philosophers and poets connected beauty with suchglorious ideas as truth and harmony. For Dante, such ideals were the guidinglights that illuminated existence. One has only to remember the conclusion ofKeats’ “Ode on a Grecian Urn:”Beauty is truth, truth beauty, that is allYe know on earth, and all ye need to know.”90The magazine cover in which feminine seductiveness, or the comic strip in whichnarrative clarity has absorbed all the artist’s creative impulses, arecontemptible, not because of their insistence on sex appeal or theirconcentration on anecdote – Titian and Boucher could rival them in the former,Giotto and Goya in the latter, but because of their lack of enrichment fromwithin. They are hollow for the same reason that abstract artists are small andoften insignificant.The success of modern advertising reflects a culture that has itself chosenillusion over reality. The supernormal images of perfection presented on themedia are worth some thought, because any kind of a guiding image has a doublenature.But idealized images are uplifting only when there is some way to move fromwhere you are in the direction of the values implicit in the image. If there isnothing to connect us with the image, so the ideal seems unattainable, we feelcut off from it, thus promoting, not the joining of the audience and the ideal,but just such a separation.Advertising promotes despair first by surrounding us with images of unattainableperfection. Second, advertising promotes despair by implying that the productwill deliver the ideal – when it can´t. People do not need new cars every threeyears, plasma television brings little enrichment of human experience, thelength of a dress does not affect the expansion of knowledge, or increase thecapacity to love. As one critic of advertising put it: “Sadness betrays theidyll (of advertising is more-than-perfect world).”Despair, is a natural by-product of the experience structured into the wayadvertising promises to deliver the values implicit in its hypernormal images.As Vladimir Nabokov accutely remarked, “In our love for the useful, for thematerial goods of life, we have become easy victims of the advertising business.The rich philistinism emanating from advertisements is due not to theirexaggerating or inventing the glory of this or that serviceable article but tosuggesting that the acme of human happiness is purchasable and that its purchasesomehow ennobles the purchaser. The amusing part, of course, is not that it is aworld where nothing spiritual remains except the ecstatic smiles of peopleserving celestial cereals but that it is a kind of satellite shadow world in theactual existence of which neither sellers nor buyers really believe in theirheart.”*****“Being immersed in Classical culture,” writes Harley Schlanger, “develops yourunderstanding of universal history, of the ideas behind the battles, to prepareyou to act as a leader in your own time. And at the heart of truly greatClassical culture – as in tragedy – the author demonstrates that a tragicdestiny is not inevitable, but that there is a path of action by which tragedymay be averted.”91As illustrated by the facts in the case of the famous Brotherhood of the CommonLife, the student who benefitted from a classical education approach ofcognitive processes is the student who at the very least has a decent chance ofbecoming a qualified genius.This quality of cognition is what separates us from animals. These are the truediscoveries of principle, the discoveries made by individual minds, that havepermitted the species to increase the potential population density of humanity,from the level of a higher ape of a few million strong to over three hundredmillion in the fifteenth century, and over seven billion today.History, if taught from the perspective of cognitive development of wholecultures, and of the individual within the culture, also acquires the status ofa true science. It is through the valid ideas, that humanity is above the apes,and most of humanity rises above the barbarous and feudal condition of “humancattle.” History, in this sense, is the history of ideas, production,circulation, and its realization.However, the first prerequisite to understanding our rightful place in theUniverse starts with you, reader.

Harley Schlanger, Who Owns Your Culture, Fidelio, Spring 2003"},{"pageContent":"Chapter SixCYBERNETICSHow does a utopia emerge, asks a voice-over in a German documentary simplytitled, The Net. Does it come into being by chance, are there one or moreinventors or is there a plan? It is at MIT, Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, that an American and international science and engineering elite areeducated. MIT also leads the way in the close partnership between the militaryand the university system. This collaboration began in World War I and continuedthroughout World War II when technology became the deciding factor in the war.On August 13, 1940, the German Luftwaffe began the ‘Battle of Britain.’ Shortlyafter the start of the German bombings, Chicago-born mathematician andphysicist, Norbert Wiener, (1894-1964), offered his expertise in the fightagainst fascism. Wiener, a ‘pioneer’ of information theory and coiner of theterm cybernetics, was professor of mathematics at MIT “and had already dealtwith questions of ballistics and artillery during World War I.”1 He wasgrappling with the problem of how to build a machine that could calculate inadvance the movement of fighter planes, so that you could shoot them down.To do that, “Wiener took into account the nature of technological warfare inwhich people, ships and planes are just abstract blips on the radar screen. Thepilot becomes one with his plane, the boundary between man and machine becomesblurred, and what emerges is a mechanized, anonymous opponent whose actions canbe modeled in war laboratory.”2 Although Wiener’s machines were not operationaluntil after the end of the war, the initial development of cybernetics wasitself a by-product of war research.While working on an anti-aircraft predictor, Wiener established parallelsbetween the operation of servomechanisms, analogue control devices used inanti-aircraft gunnery and purposeful behaviour of pilots and gunners: in bothcases, the goal was being reached via a feedback mechanism. From this research,Wiener then “postulated that control via feedback and communication viainformation exchange constituted universal mechanisms of purposeful behaviourfor both living organisms and self-regulating machines such as computers.”3In fact, just as the Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency(DARPA)-funded experiments in the 1970s laid the basis for the Internet,innovations in science and technology such as Artificial Intelligence, computergraphics, holographics, satellite communications, fiber-optic cable TV,three-dimensional imaging, and the first generation of computer simulatorscreated in places like MIT’s famous Radiation Laboratory were by-products of thewar effort4 and served as critical think-tanks for the U.S. military.“The basis of cybernetics is the assumption that the human nervous system doesnot reproduce reality, but calculates it. Man, now appears to be no more than aninformation-processing system; thought is data processing and the brain is themachine made of flesh. The brain is no longer the place where ‘ego’ and‘identity’ are mysteriously created through memory and consciousness. It is amachine consisting of switches and controlling circuits, feedback loops andcommunication nodes. A black box where cause is effect and effect is causewithin an infinite cycle... a closed feedback system with input and output thatcan be controlled and calculated, no longer, as previously, starting out fromthe contemplation of nature, but from indisputable mathematics and logic.”5One gets a sense of being inside the Matrix trilogy staring at the cyberworldthrough the looking glass. Listen to Matrix Reloaded: “The new philosophy ofhuman interrelations, sociometry, gives us a methodology and guide fordetermination of the central structure of society through the evocation ofspontaneity of the human subject-agents. These factors, once located anddiagrammed, supply us with the basis upon which the planning of all the manyfacets and activities of society may be undertaken – from juvenile and adulteducation to super-governments and world states.”6When compared to Wiener’s own writing, the visions are remarkably similar. Now,listen to what Wiener had to say: “Very many of the factors which previouslyprecluded a World State have been abrogated. It is even possible to maintainthat modern communication, which forces us to adjudicate the internationalclaims of different broadcasting systems and different aeroplane nets, has madethe World State inevitable.” Wiener was joined in this endeavour by many of theleading ‘social scientists’ and proponents of the counterculture movement suchas anthropologist Margaret Mead and psychiatrist Gregory Bateson, who alsoparticipated in the Cybernetics Conferences of the 1940s, hosted by the JosiahMacy, Jr. Foundation.7 Wiener, Bateson, Mead and company see cybernetics as themost revolutionary way of making science, perhaps the biggest bite out of theNewtonian “apple of knowledge” that mankind has taken in the past 2,000 years.It was Wiener’s sinister attack on the epistemology responsible for mankind’sdevelopment and survival, which he elaborates in his book, Cybernetics, where heequates the human brain to a logical binary system,8 that these social engineersfound particularly useful.In that, Wiener is Bertrand Russell’s intellectual equal. Russell,9 anembittered defender of oligarchic racialism, whose only love became the hatredof mankind had as his life-long mission “to reduce the human mind to a binaryprocessor. This reductionism was the basis for experiments carried out byfacilities such as the Tavistock Institute in London.”10 Extrapolating thepremise into the counterculture, social engineers thought that computers couldplay a similar role to LSD for use in mind control. In other words, creatingartificial ‘concentration camps without tears.’”11However, in order to have a ‘concentration camp without tears’ you must havecontrol, communications and feedback. And that’s where cybernetics come in withthe behaviour of whole, complex systems known today as social engineering. It isa living history of social engineering that concerns us and how it evolved fromold-fashioned electroshock therapy, to the modern day, “group shock therapy.”MIT’s Research Center for Group Dynamics and Britain’s Tavistock Institute havebeen at the forefront of research into the subject of consensus through groupdynamics. One thing empire builders like David Rockefeller have always known:Persuasion is key to setting up fascist movements. That’s one of the reasons whyinitially, going back to the 1950s, oligarchical foundations were investingexorbitant sums of money in cybernetics and why the same foundations arespending billions today on social-networking technologies, in order “to changewhat people believe and what they do.”12But they weren’t the only ones. Others carried out their research as well, suchas Douglas McGregor, management professor at MIT and Alex Bavelas, a notedpsychologist with Group Networks Laboratory at MIT, “who set up their ownpsychological laboratory, where they studied groups of managers through two-wayglass. Forrester and McGregor wanted to literally map out the processes by whichpeople change their views and opinions. The ultimate goal was to form auniversal model of group decision-making. In 1964 Jay Forrester – a leadingcomputer expert and the father of system dynamics who had joined the SloanSchool in 1956 – even tried to design a model to create a computer simulation ofa T-group sessions.”13 These programs could then be used to steer or “herd”popular opinion into a desired direction.Over the years, the cybernetic “change agents” expanded their research fromgroup think and decision-making models to developing technologies to map theflow of rumors through society, which they claim spread like the transmission ofepidemics, such as AIDS.14This technology, with minimal adjustments, could also be used to create socialmovements, thereby setting the stage for gang and counter-gang conflicts15 –techniques entirely coherent with those used by Rockefeller-CIA and described ingreat detail elsewhere in this book.The similarity to Matrix Reloaded is eerie and uncanny at the same time: “Thetask of the social scientist (change agents) is to invent the adequate tools forthe exploration of a chosen domain. On the level of human interrelationships,this domain is made up of the interactive spontaneities of all the individualscomposing it. Therefore, the task of the social scientist becomes the shaping ofthe tools in the fashion as to enable him to arouse the individual to therequired point of spontaneity on a scale which runs all the way to the maximum.But individuals cannot be aroused – or only to an insignificant degree – byundynamic or automatic means. The individuals must be adequately motivated sothat the full strength of their spontaneous responses is evoked. Thus, theintention and shaping of methods for social investigation and the stirring up ofreactions, thoughts and feelings of the people on whom they are used must gohand in hand.”16The investigation and research into various social disciplines affecting humanbehavior and group think have always been funded by foundations with stronglinks to a control apparatus such as the Rockefeller Foundation, FordFoundation, Russell Sage Foundation and Josiah Macy Foundation, to name a few.In fact, “non-profit foundations have long been a favorite instrument by whichone or another oligarchical faction has been able to discreetly test andimplement new ideas in social control. The power of the biggest foundations islegendary. Since the end of the last century, institutions like the FordFoundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, or the Russell Sage Foundation have beenable to routinely override the objections of elected officials and go on tocompletely shape America’s education policy, its public health policy, and eventhe operations of the Federal government itself.”17FIRST CYBERNETICS CONFERENCE. 8-9 MARCH, 1946, NYCCybernetics’ origins can be associated with a series of 10 conferencesthroughout the 1940s and the 1950s, sponsored by the Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundationfrom 1946 through 1953. The foundation, created in New York City in 1930, wasnamed after a New England Quaker named Josiah Macy, Jr. In 1872, the Macys’ LongIsland Oil Company became an arm’s-length proprietary for the RockefellerFoundation when they became part of the growing Standard Oil Empire of John D.Rockefeller.Known among its members as the ‘Man-Machine Project,’ it was launched in May1942 at a New York City conference called the Cerebral Inhibition Meeting, underthe auspices of the Josiah Macy Foundation and sponsored by the medicaldirector, Frank Fremont-Smith. In a sense, this was the foundation’s firstvoyage into ‘mind control.’ The Cerebral Inhibition Meeting starred a leadingexpert on hypnosis named Milton Erickson. The discussion Centred around“problems of central inhibition of the nervous system that helped lay the basisfor what would later become cybernetic theory.”18Among the participants were Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, a professor ofpsychiatry and physiology at the University of Illinois and Kurt Lewin, ofFrankfurt School. “Lewin’s National Training Laboratory would later become partof the National Education Association, and would facilitate the transformationof public education in America into an approximation of Bertrand Russell’snightmarish scheme for teaching children that ‘snow is black.’”19 Others whoattended the conference were Mexican physiologist Arturo Rosenblueth,behavioural scientist Lawrence K. Frank, Gregory Bateson, a pivotal player inMK-ULTRA and other secret government experiments with mind-altering drugs,including Margaret Mead, the assistant curator of ethnology at the AmericanMuseum of Natural History in New York, who would help launch the modern feministmovement. For all her goofiness, a sex-crazed Mead was heavily involved with theworld of intelligence beginning with her work at Institute for InterculturalStudies, which had been financed during World War II by the Office of NavalResearch as well as the Air Force’s RAND Corporation.According to Macy’s web page, “It was Arturo Rosenblueth’s presentation at aninformal 1942 meeting of ideas he’d been developing with Norbert Wiener andJulian Bigelow that drew everyone’s attention.” Rosenblueth, a protégé ofNorbert Wiener, outlined a conceptual agenda based on similarities betweenbehaviours of both machines and organisms that were interpretable as being‘goal-directed.’ This goal-directedness was framed in terms of definitive anddeterministic ‘teleological mechanisms.’ ‘Teleology’ was transformed fromphilosophical mumbo-jumbo to concrete mechanism through the invocation of‘circular causality’ in a system, whereby new behaviors were influenced by‘feedback’ deriving from immediately preceding behaviors. This approach allowedone to address apparent purposiveness with reference to the present and theimmediate past, without having to invoke references to possible or futureevents.”20According to Jeffrey Steinberg, “Rosenblueth proposed to draw together a groupof engineers, biologists, neurologists, anthropologists, and psychologists, todevise experiments in social control, based on the quack claim that the humanbrain was nothing more than a complex input/output machine, and that humanbehavior could, in effect, be programmed, on both an individual and societalscale.”21However, these ideas would have to wait until after the end of WWII. Batesonundertook assignments in the pacific region with the US Army, while Rosenbluethand McCulloch returned to their research at MIT. The first conference tok placeshortly after the war, in March 1946 in New York under the title, “The FeedbackMechanisms and Circular Causal Systems in Biology and the Social SciencesMeeting.” All together, ten major conferences took place between 1946 and 1953.Putting clinicians together with mathematicians, sociologists, and economists,the project’s objective were “to create a theoretical model of extreme stress,”especially taking into account the psychosomatic “feedback overload” whichappeared to cause many shell shock cases.From the cyberneticians’ point of view, this was a truly revolutionary concept:“If one could create a model of a physiological system through which informationis received from the environment, processed, and then fed back to change thatenvironment, then, perhaps, it were possible to model the human mind itself,especially if one used the computational machines then being developed. Thegroup became devoted to the premise, later stated by one of the foundingmembers, John von Neumann, that the human nervous system is really just ‘anefficiently organized, large natural automaton,’ which is therefore subject todeterministic, linear mathematical modelling.”22“What came out of that first meeting was not only a demonic drive to create theultimate engineered society, based on the fusion of man and machine. A coregroup of 20 people constituted themselves as a task force to carry out thismission, and would spawn a series of permanent institutions, where the workwould continue, to the present day. A year after the founding session of theMacy project, Wiener would coin the term ‘cybernetics’ to describe theireffort.”23In 1948, as a result of the first Macy Foundation meetings, Weiner wroteCybernetics: or the Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine.24Acclaimed to be one of the “seminal books... comparable in ultimate importanceto... Galileo or Malthus or Rousseau or Mill,” Cybernetics was judged bytwenty-seven historians, economists, educators, and philosophers to be one ofthose books published during the “past four decades,” which may have asubstantial impact on public thought and action in the years ahead.”25One of the key discussion points at the very first Cybernetics conference dealtwith the following question: Is the mind a product of the brain? From the animalworld, Warren McCulloch and his sidekick Walter Pitts, two of the Macy meeting’sorganizers first tested networks of brain cells for their computationcapabilities. From a cybernetic perspective, machines are not things but ways ofbehaving. To cyberneticians, such as Alan Turing and Joseph LeDoux, brains are‘universal machines’ and ‘devices for recording changes.’ What all these peoplehave in common is a fixed idea that our brains are a recursive set of cyberneticlearning machines connected by a gigantic feedback loop to the universe itself.Consequently, the cybernetic, scientific paradigm embraces this type ofrelativity.Ross Ashby, English psychiatrist and a pioneer in cybernetics, the study ofcomplex systems explains: “Cybernetic, typically treats any given, particularmachine by asking not what individual act will it produce now, but what are allthe possible behaviors that it can produce. It deals with all forms of behaviourin so far as they are regular or determinate or reproducible. Natural reality isirrelevant. The connection between this approach to machines and the informationtheory is important. Information theory is characterised essentially by dealingalways with a set of possibilities. What is important is the extent to which thesystem is subject to determining and controlling factors.”In other words, what cybernetics offer is the framework on which all individualmachines may be ordered, related and understood. Thus, the larger the variety ofactions available to a control system, the larger the variety of perturbationsit is able to compensate. And how does Ashby define control? “As a reduction ofvariety: perturbations with high variety affect the system’s internal state,which should be kept as close as possible to the goal state, and thereforeexhibit a low variety.”26Weiner and Ashby argued that the sciences must be regarded as solelydescriptive, devoid of cause. In this way, humanity’s relationship to the world(and vice versa) becomes an erotic attachment to Aristotelian objects. Thecomprehension of the universal is therefore illusory. “The ‘Unity of Sciences’attempted to destroy metaphysics and the existence of universal principles, byarguing that any divisions in science, e.g., any divisions between life,non-life, and cognition, were non-existent. They applied this extremereductionism to physics and the social sciences alike, thereby claiming to unifythem. Society was reduced to individual psychologies; individual psychologieswere reduced to biological processes; biological processes were reduced tochemical processes. And so, human cognition was reduced to the electro-chemicalprocesses of the brain: neurons firing or turning off, like a binary system.Finally, even the electro-chemical processes of the brain were reduced toNewtonian mechanics.”27By the early 1950s, Weiner, Ashby, British theorist Stafford Beer and otherswere grappling with the problem posed by Ashby: how to give aesthetics a firmlymaterialistic, non-causal basis. In essence, the cyberneticians’ problem wasGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. “At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Leibnizobliterated the centuries old Gnostic dualism dividing mind and body, bydemonstrating that matter does not think. A creative act in art or scienceapprehends the truth of the physical universe, but it is not determined by thatphysical universe. By self-consciously concentrating the past in the present toeffect the future, the creative act, properly defined, is as immortal as thesoul which envisions the act.”28And this is something that the cyberniticians simply could not accept. Theyviewed cognition simply as a reaction to external stimuli. “Since bodies at reststay at rest until acted upon by another body, the internal process of cognitionwas eliminated. Thus there was no ‘divine spark,’ or soul. These conceptionswould provide the basis for the discussions at the Cybernetics conference yearslater.”29Wiener and the cyberneticians thought the creative method was just a randomby-product of access to ‘information.’ Therefore, “they would monitor the amountof information released into the ‘field,’ acting as the information thermostatfor society. In order to control the flow of information, they nested themselvesinside major media outlets and opinion-shaping centers.”30This degenerate sleight-of-hand allows one to do several things at once. “Bymaking creativity historically-specific, you rob it of both immortality andmorality. One cannot hypothesize universal truth, or natural law, for truth iscompletely relative to historical development. By discarding the idea of truthand error, you also may throw out the “obsolete” concept of good and evil; youare, in the words of Friedrich Nietzsche, ‘beyond good and evil.’”31“Later, the heirs of the cyberneticians were involved in creating the‘information superhighway.’ They created software that monitored the flow of“information” on the Internet like a massive electrical circuit board, settingup the circuit-breakers and monitoring the voltage. This concept was at the coreof ‘social networking,’ the establishment of sets of game theory matrices aimedat enforcing consensus. The mechanisation of societal relations was based onWiener’s idea that it were possible to mechanise thought.”32When applied to human models, we immediately run into problems. Humans arecreative. Through the dominant, Judeo-Christian cultural matrix of Westernideology and the exercise of our reason, “we can discover principles beyondsense perception, and create technologies that allow our fellow humans to riseabove the limits of our previous resource base. That is a simple refutation ofthe bogus entropy of Russell’s positivists. We humans can also develop ourmastery of social principles, like agape, in the domain of classical artisticcomposition. The ability to communicate these principles from one generation tothe next enables a culture to elaborate its own continuing transformation.Modern nations can only achieve this progress by promoting the development ofthe sovereign minds of their citizens. Cultural development of this type, is thetrue mission of a republic.33“The problem was, that as long as the individual had the belief – or even thehope of the belief – that his or her divine spark of reason could solve theproblems facing society, then that society would never reach the state ofhopelessness and alienation which was recognized as the necessary prerequisitefor socialist revolution. The task of the Frankfurt School, then, was first, toundermine the Judeo-Christian legacy through an ‘abolition of culture’ and,second, to determine new cultural forms, which would increase the alienation ofthe population, thus creating a ‘new barbarism.’”34Therefore, Russell’s intellectually degenerate offspring needed to eliminatethose sovereign minds, otherwise their creativity would upset the equilibrium ofthe predetermined ‘ecology.’ “In Lewin’s electromagnetic grid, those ‘nodes’that attracted other ‘nodes’ through their ability to share ideas and create newcapabilities for the survival of mankind, would need to be neutralized. Thisrequired the work of ‘change agents,’ to bring the field back to the drabuniformity of consensus, and to maintain the equilibrium of ecology.“Lewin’s ‘field theory,’ where ‘field’ simply became a statement that reflectedassumed axioms about the nature of the relationships between the objects appliedthe same circular logic to human relations. And, as a closed system, the fieldwas subject to the arbitrary laws of entropy. Lewin assumed that humans werelike monkeys, whose relationships were determined through a calculus ofhedonism. Cyberneticians such as Weiner, Ashby and Beer use a language ofelectromagnetics to describe the relationships, borrowing from James Maxwell’s‘field theory’ for electromagnetism. Since Maxwell had decided that causality inscience was irrelevant, his theory wasn´t actually a science.“Where Maxwell assigned a “one” for a strong degree of cohesion and a “zero” forweak attraction in an electromagnetic grid, Lewin would do the same: “one” forthe level of attraction between a monkey and its mother, “zero” for a predatormonkey. The “field” became an aggregate of the relations among the hedonisticmonkeys, which merely reflected Lewin’s axioms about the nature of humanity.Universal principles, such as agape, were reduced to “game theory” by Lewin andhis acolytes. As a closed system, devoid of principle, Lewin’s field was alsosubject to entropy, or what a zoologist would call ‘ecology.’“Entropy applied to magnets and monkeys is one thing, but what happens whenthese rules are applied to humanity? Is a human economy subject to the samerules as monkey ecology?35 For Lewin, Maxwell, the Tavistockians, and all theintellectually sodomized children of Bertrand Russell, the answer is “yes!” Itis here that our big problem arises, and it is here also, that these socialengineers pulled off their masks to reveal their “fascism with a democraticface.”36For Norbert Wiener and his sidekicks, the core of the Cybernetics Group project,there was nothing sacred about the human mind, and the human brain was amachine, whose functioning could be replicated, and eventually surpassed, bycomputers.FRANKFURT SCHOOLOne of the organizations directly linked to the cybernetics group was theInstitute for Social Research (I.S.R.), but popularly known as the FrankfurtSchool. For example, Paul Lazarsfeld the director of the Radio Project was oneof the invitees to the Macy Conferences. Also on hand was Max Horkheimer, thehead of the Frankfurt School famous for his work in critical theory. “In May1944, the American Jewish Committee established a Department of ScientificResearch, which was headed by Frankfurt School director Max Horkheimer.Horkheimer established a project, called Studies in Prejudice, with generousfunding from the AJC and other agencies, including the Rockefellerfoundations.37“The most significant of the five Studies in Prejudice, produced for the AJCduring 1944-50, was The Authoritarian Personality.38 Authors Adorno, ElseFrenkel-Brunswik, Levinson, and Sanford assembled a large research team from theBerkeley Public Opinion Study and the International Institute of SocialResearch, to conduct thousands of interviews of Americans, to profile theirallegedly deep-seated tendencies toward authoritarianism, prejudice, andanti-Semitism. Dr. William Morrow, the leading protégé of Dr. Kurt Lewin, whowas one key, bridge figure between the Frankfurt School and the TavistockInstitute, was a research director for the Authoritarian Personality project.”39The authors of The Authoritarian Personality let it all hang out in theconcluding chapter of the book, in which they summarized their findings andspelled out their recipe for social transformation:“It seems obvious, that the modification of the potentially fascist structurecannot be achieved by psychological means alone. The task is comparable to thatof eliminating neurosis, or delinquency, or nationalism from the world. Theseare products of the total organization of society and are to be changed only asthat society is changed. It is not for the psychologist to say how such changesare to be brought about. The problem is one, which requires the efforts of allsocial scientists. All that we would insist upon is that in the councils orround tables where the problem is considered and action planned the psychologistshould have a voice. We believe that the scientific understanding of societymust include an understanding of what it does to people, and that it is possibleto have social reforms, even broad and sweeping ones, which though desirable intheir own right would not necessarily change the structure of the prejudicedpersonality. For the fascist potential to change, or even to be held in check,there must be an increase in people’s capacity to see themselves and to bethemselves. This cannot be achieved by the manipulation of people, however wellgrounded in modern psychology the devices of manipulation might be.… It is herethat psychology may play its most important role. Techniques for overcomingresistance, developed mainly in the field of individual psychotherapy, can beimproved and adapted for use with groups and even for use on a mass scale.”The authors conclude with this most revealing proposition: “We need not supposethat appeal to emotion belongs to those who strive in the direction of fascism,while democratic propaganda must limit itself to reason and restraint. If fearand destructiveness are the major emotional sources of fascism, eros belongsmainly to democracy.”40THE CYBERNETICS GROUPThe Frankfurt School and their closest allies at Tavistock, “were the architectsof both the cybernetics project and the counterculture project of the 1960s. Infact, the Cybernetics Group, sponsored by the Josiah Macy Foundation, was theumbrella, under which the CIA and British intelligence conducted their massexperimentation with mind-altering psychedelic drugs, including LSD-25, whichexperiment was, eventually, spilled out onto the streets of San Francisco, NewYork’s Greenwich Village, and every American college campus, giving us thecounterculture ‘paradigm shift’ of 1966-72.”41 In 1965, one of the fourdirectors of the Authoritarian Personality project, R. Nevitt Sanford, wrote theforward to Utopiates: The Use and Users of LSD 25, which was published byTavistock Publications. I will come back to this later in the report.If you are to believe the official gloss, since 1930, the Josiah Macy Jr.Foundation has devoted itself to the promotion of health and the relief ofsuffering, (http://www.josiahmacyfoundation.org/about/history),42 directing itssupport toward medical education and established programs supporting conferencesand publications on these and related topics.The historian Jean-Pierre Dupuy describes the Macy Foundation’s role in theCybernetics Group this way: “Cybernetics was obliged from the beginning to allyitself with a movement- a political lobby, actually, operating under theauspices of the Macy Foundation – that sought to assure world peace anduniversal mental health by means of a bizarre cocktail concocted frompsychoanalysis, cultural anthropology, advanced physics, and the new thinkingassociated with the Cybernetics Group.”43Corporate media propaganda subsequently brainwashed the masses to believe thatMacy Foundation and figures such as Lazarsfeld and Weiner, Bateson, Mead andAshby were merely participants in social experiments to improve the quality oflife through the hodgepodge merging of technology, evolution and various socialsciences. In reality, these individuals were lackeys for the foundations of theoligarchic World Empire – Rockefeller, Josiah Macy, Russell Sage and others.Less well known to the general public is that the Macy Foundation has done moreto harm America’s social reality than any other single institution. “During andimmediately after World War II, the Macy Foundation was utilized by acombination which included the British secret services, corrupt sections ofAmerican intelligence, plus treasonous members of the U.S. establishment, toconduct a vast social experiment. The overall purpose of the experiment was toend the uncontrolled optimism of a population that had just won a world war andhad started to rebuild the world, and instead, to redirect that energy inwardupon itself.“Three parts of that experiment became so successful, that most people todaythink of them as some ‘natural’ evolution of Western society, rather than as anunnatural deformation imposed from the outside. The ‘Sexual Revolution’ of thelate 1960s and early 1970s, which decisively accelerated today’s collapse of thenuclear family, could not have occurred in the form in which it did, without theMacy Foundation’s almost single-handed sponsorship of the development anddissemination of oral contraceptives through the work of Harvard’s Dr. GregoryPincus. Pincus was studying reproduction, and the eugenicists at Macy werestudying how certain types of people should not be allowed to engage inreproduction. In 1954, Macy awarded Pincus a large special grant. In 1955,Pincus patented ‘the Pill.’”44“Similarly, the Macy Foundation was a primary actor in creating the ‘PsychedelicRevolution,’ thereby turning a post-war population that hitherto looked atsleeping pills with suspicion, into today’s America, which routinely takes a newdrug for every new mood, and prescribes psychoactive substances to its childrenby the millions of doses. And perhaps most importantly, it was the MacyFoundation that helped to pervert American citizens’ world-renowned sense oftechnological optimism, into the now-pervasive ideology of the ‘InformationAge.’”45THE MACY FOUNDATION AND MK-ULTRAThe bizarre Macy cocktail blend of the late 1940s and early 1950s became one ofthe primary covert funding conduits for the CIA through Macy Foundation directorFrank Fremont-Smith. Fremont-Smith was very close to Dr. Harold Abramson, theCIA-linked psychiatrist and associated professionally with both ColumbiaUniversity and Mt. Sinai Hospital whose LSD work had Macy Foundation cover.One such individual was Dr. Louis Jolyon ‘Jolly’ West, then chair of UCLA’sDepartment of Psychiatry and director of the Neuropsychiatric Institute. Westwas most famous as a CIA-contract psychiatrist whose work on the MK-ULTRAprogram in the 1950s involved feeding LSD to elephants.Aside from Dr. Abramson, a significant number of the Macy Foundation conferencemembers such as Gregory Bateson, Margaret Mead, and psychologist Kurt Lewinworked closely with the U.S. government during the Cold War under covertMK-ULTRA drug brainwashing experiments on the one hand and psychedelic drugs asa means of social manipulation on the other.Another key participant in the Macy conferences was Donald Marquis, then aUniversity of Michigan psychologist. “Marquis helped organize basic research onthe psychology of propaganda, on the nature of various national targets, and onvarious social groups within nations through MIT’s Center for Group Dynamics(CGD).”46 It would inspire MIT’s ‘Group Networks Laboratory’ to study smallgroup dynamics under the supervision of Alex Bavelas, one of the top leveladvisor on Cold War secret operations for the Office of Naval Research (ONR)contracted out of MIT. This same MIT group later worked with the CIA to producea major study of Communist Chinese “coercive persuasion” techniques morepopularly known as “brainwashing.”Other Macy studies, such as a sponsored study in ‘cell biology’ were actuallyanalysing techniques in eugenics, or ‘race science.’ Large amounts of grantmoney also went to what the foundation called ‘psychosomatic interrelations,’that is, “how physiological change affects the mind, and vice versa. This was acover for work on clinical techniques that would later be called‘brainwashing.’”47“The Macy Foundation also provided financing and publicity for the Britishsocial engineer Dr. William Sargant, whose 1957 book, Battle for the Mind,provided a “how-to-do-it” manual for mass brainwashing. Sargant, a specialist in‘shock trauma spent 20 years in the United States, working on the MK-ULTRAproject and other secret mind-control efforts of the U.S. and Britishgovernments.”48EUGENICSThroughout history, there have been those who, with an eye to specific politicalobjectives have used terror or the threat of terror against targetedpopulations. The scientific rationale for tyranny has always been attractive tothe elites because it creates a convenient excuse to treat their fellow men aslower than animals. Eugenics, a crackpot notion of hereditary superiority andinferiority originated in the 1880s and 1890s, spawned by a British network offamilies including Darwin’s cousin Sir Francis Galton, Thomas Huxley, Sir ArthurBalfour, the Cadbury and the Wedgewood families as well as other late 19thcentury British Empire strategists linked to the Round Table movement of CecilRhodes and Lord Alfred Milner. They saw an opportunity to advance mankindtowards a new Dark Age by taking the reigns of Darwin’s perversely racialist‘survival of the fittest’ natural selection evolution theory and applied socialprinciples to develop social Darwinism.In the United States, the story of eugenics begins in 1904, when the Cold SpringHarbor Laboratory was started by prominent eugenicist Charles Davenport with thefunding of leading American would-be oligarchs, the Rockefeller, Carnegie andHarriman. By 1910, the British had created the first network of social workersexpressly to serve as spies and enforcers of the eugenics race cult that wasrapidly taking control of Western society. Hitler’s English financial backersweren’t the only ones sponsoring the eugenics research. In the 1920s, theRockefeller family bankrolled the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Genealogy andDemography, which later would form a central pillar in the Third Reich.At the end of the war, with corpses still smoking across Europe, the alliesprotected from prosecution the very Nazi scientists such as Josef Mengele whohad tortured thousands of people to death. The Nazi radical brand of eugenicshad embarrassed the Anglo-American social controllers, making ‘eugenics’ and‘mental hygiene’ dirty words. The controllers, however, wouldn’t be deterred.“In 1956, the British Eugenics Society decided in a resolution that, the societyshould pursue eugenics by less obvious means.”49 This means ‘planned parenthood’and the environmentalist movement. Every population control policy was simplyrenamed as they continued their work under the protection of the United Nationsand its associate organizations. The Eugenics, Euthanasia and Mental HygieneSocieties of Britain, America and the rest of Europe, was simply renamed themore palatable Mental Health Association of Great Britain and NationalAssociation of Mental Health of the United States which later became WorldFederation of Mental Health. I will come back to them later in this section.Eugenics Quarterly Magazine became Social Biology and the American Birth ControlLeague became Planned Parenthood, which today is responsible for a massivede-population in Africa. It is not widely known that some of the largest aidagencies and U.S. Christian Fundamentalist groups have been covertly running inAfrica over the past several decades. Its banner is Family Planning, which isturned on its head when one understands the real implications and far-reachingobjectives. These family planning policies are vigorously and consistentlyadvocated by major bilateral donors such as the U.S. Government through itssurrogate, U.S.-AID and multilateral agencies, most notably the InternationalPlanned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), the U.N. Fund for Population Activities(UNFPA) and the World Bank in Africa.The World Bank, since the 1960s has been the leading funding entity ofpopulation control, with annual spending skyrocketing from a paltry $27 millionin 1969-1970 to over $4.5 billion by 2006. World Bank Presidents Eugene Blackand Robert McNamara were at one time trustees of Rockefeller-controlled FordFoundation. “More significantly, population control policies have now become akey condition required for the disbursement of structural adjustment loans(SALs) by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund within theframework of their Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs).”50 SAP conditionstypically include, in addition to devaluation, liberalization and privatizationof the national economies and of the health and education sectors, populationcontrol policies. Thus, preparation of a Population Policy Statement is atypical condition for the disbursement of a SAP.Betsy Hartmann, Director of the Population and Development Program at HampshireCollege, coined a new term for such policies: Malthusian Eco-Fascism (MEF). Shenotes that the international aid community currently concentrates its populationcontrol efforts in Sub Saharan Africa, and family planning becomes the numberone priority: “The overriding imperative of these internationally generatedprograms is to reduce population growth as fast and ‘cost-effectively’ aspossible.” As she rightly observes, in much of Africa where AIDS threatenstragic human and demographic consequences, the present emphasis on populationcontrol and de-funding of health systems amount to indirect triage.”51Needless to say, Africa is not the only continent where these brutal policiesare enacted. In 1972, in an effort to deal with the so-called ‘populationemergency’ in India, the World Bank funded a $21 million project which “resultedin millions of involuntary sterilizations and thousands of deaths.”52 The confluence of eugenicists, Nazis, environmentalists and One World Companyenthusiasts also converge through a secretive 1001 Club, comprised of the mostancient and powerful families of Europe, who finance covert Malthusianoperations of the WWF in Africa. One such operation run by WWF, for example, wascalled Operation Lock, ostensibly to save the black rhino in South Africa. “JohnHanks, WWF’s Africa director financed a team of ‘retired’ British SAS commandosto infiltrate and sabotage so-called poaching rings through an outsideparamilitary force instigating black-on-black violence between the AfricanNational Congress and Inkatha Freedom Party by carrying out targeted acts ofviolence, like the June 18, 1992 Boipatong massacre.”53 The massacre caused theAfrican National Congress to walk out of the initial formal negotiations to endapartheid, accusing the ruling National Party of complicity in the attacks.54 The goal was “to trigger a bloody civil war and prevent the end of the apartheidsystem and the reintegration of South Africa into the world community.”55WWF and its direct action terrorist arm, Greenpeace, as well as like-mindedgroups are not just some lunatic fringe that can easily be ignored; they are theshock troops of the oligarchy in their fight against humany. “Malthusian” lawsimilar to what was proposed for the UN 1994 Cairo Population Conference is atheory in demography regarding population growth developed during the industrialrevolution on the basis of the writings of Thomas Malthus’ famous 1798 OnPopulation, which was nothing more than a plagiarized version of Venetian monkGiammaria Ortes’ 1790 publication, Riflessioni sulla popolazione delle nazioni.According to his theory, population expands faster than food supplies. Ortes isthe intellectual author upon which the genocidal 1994 U.N. Cairo PopulationConference draft was based.Most people may find all of this mind boggling at the very least, but thecultural heroes from the bygone era such as Margaret Mead, Huxley brothers, andthe late Carl Jung, chief promoter of the “collective racial unconscious,” notonly attended conferences year after year with the Nazi doctor responsible forsome of the most heinous crimes against the human race, but wholeheartedlysupported every “theory” which brought on the Nazi holocaust against humanity.For example, Jung was an editor in the pre-war years of German Journal ofPsychotherapy with Dr. M.H. Goering, Hermann Goering’s cousin and a participantin a “T4” euthanasia project: the elimination of 400,000 mental patients inGerman institutions.WORLD FEDERATION OF MENTAL HEALTHWorld Federation of Mental Health is a perfect example of this confluence ofRockefeller-CIA-Tavistock apparatus. Rees, anthropologist Margaret Mead,behavioural scientist Lawrence K. Frank, Josiah Macy executive Fremont-Smith andGerman sociologist Max Horkheimer were all in Paris together, in the summer of1948, to launch the WFMH. “Although he had died the previous year, Kurt Lewinhad been involved in the preparations for launching the Federation, through hisinvolvement, under Frank, in the National Committee for Mental Hygiene, and theLondon-Centred International Committee for Mental Hygiene, with a half-dozenCybernetics Group members on its board. Both bodies oversaw a network of over4,000 ‘psychiatric shock troops,’ in Rees’s words, who would be at the heart ofa world-wide social-engineering apparatus, penetrated into every community.“Margaret Mead and Lawrence K. Frank, two pillars of the Cybernetics Group,authored the founding statement of Rees’s World Federation of Mental Health(both Mead and Freemont-Smith would later succeed Rees as president), which theytitled, “Manifesto of the First International. Mead and Freemont-Smith bluntlywrote: The goal of mental health has been enlarged from the concern for thedevelopment of healthy personalities to the larger tasks of creating a healthysociety.… The concept of mental health is co-extensive with world order andworld community.”56There are three dominant features to WFMH’s Manifesto. Firstly, Rees stressedthe need to apply World War I and World War II military psychiatric experienceas a paradigm “for a system of community mental health clinics, through whichcounterinsurgency psychiatrists could forcibly administer”57 ‘therapy’ to largepopulation groups. Another key point in the Manifesto stressed the need ofplacing psychiatrists in key positions, which would allow them to playdeterminant roles in administrative and social programs of government andindustry. As investigator L. Marcos wrote back in 1974, “one should not beastonished that the late George Orwell conceived his 1984 novel after a periodof exposure to a group of Rees’ followers.”58Launched by the Cybernetics Group in 1948, the World Federation of Mental Health(WFMH) was among the nastiest projects launched by the world’s leadingsociologists, psychiatrists, and anthropologists, the so-called “psychiatricshock troops,” whose first president, Brig. Gen. John Rawlings Rees, was thedirector of the Tavistock Institute, Britain’s premier psychological warfarecenter. Carl Jung was elected vice president. Another individual closelyassociated with WFMH was the Nazi doctor Werner Villinger who sat on the WhiteHouse Conference on Children and Youth in the United States in the 1950s. For asmuch as Jung’s supporters would like to deny it, there is no bending the facts:Jung was not confused about whom he was backing – Hitler and the Nazis.Meanwhile, immediately after the war, Sir Julian Huxley changed the name oftheir program for enforced birth control, zero economic growth, and thetechnology of mass mind control, and continued to apply the principles whichcreated Nazi Germany’s mass murder against the “racially unfit.” In 1946, Huxleyannounced that, “even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policywill be for many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will beimportant for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with thegreatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake sothat much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.”59 In 1974,Henry Kissinger, Huxley’s intellectually sodomized son said, “depopulationshould be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world.”Huxley was a founder of the British Eugenics Society, first Director-General ofUNESCO which pushed for population reduction, and what Huxley called ‘a singleculture for the world’; he was also a leading member of WFMH, director of theAbortion Law Reform Association and founder of the World Wildlife Fund whosefirst president was the former card-carrying Nazi, Prince Bernhard of theNetherlands and one of the organizers of the Bilderberg meetings since itsinception in 1954.Few realize that Huxley represented a social set of miscreants the likes ofwhich have not been seen since. Amongst them was his grandfather, Thomas Huxley,whose outspoken support of Charles Darwin’s degenerate theory of evolutionearned him the nickname, Darwin’s Bulldog; his personal mentor and SatanistAleister Crowley; the aforementioned Brigadier John Rawlings Rees; BertrandRussell and H.G. Wells, whose Open Conspiracy was a call for fascist imperialworld dictatorship. “What makes the ‘open conspiracy’ open, is not the layingout of some secret masterplan, not the revealing of the membership roster ofsome inner sanctum of the rich and powerful, but rather, the understanding thatideas, philosophy and culture, control history.” Also involved, Julian’s brotherAldous, of the Brave New World fame. In Aldous Huxley’s book, the population isgenetically divided into Alphas, Betas, all the way down to the syntheticallyproduced Epsilon morons through the application of eugenics, or Nazi breedinglaws.Over the years, “the WFMH itself became a huge clearing-house of psychologicalwarfare profiles used by British and American intelligence services during theCold War. A typical Macy-WFMH joint project was the ‘Conferences on Problems ofHealth and Human Relations in Germany,’ a series of high-level, 1950-51 meetingsdesigned to convince German social scientists and health care providers that theFrankfurt School’s bogus ‘authoritarian personality’ profile should be reliedupon in dealing with German patients.”60New terms like transhumanism, population control, sustainability, conservation,bioethics and environmentalism replaced the now outdated racial hygiene andsocial Darwinism and in the process “prepared public opinion, medical education,and government policy to discard the notion of the sanctity of human life.”61Except that as investigative journalist Rob Ainsworth explains, “theenvironmentalist movement is anything but the grassroots movement it pretends tobe. The biggest and most influential groups receive tens of millions of dollarsin funding every year, and the boards of trustees and directors reflect this.”62From Survival International to United Nations Environment Program, fromWorldwatch Institute to International Food Policy Research Institute, from WorldResources Institute to Greepeace, the Nature Conservancy and Swiss-basedInternational Union for the Conservation of Nature, from the UN Developmentprogram to the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Environmental Defense...are run by bankers, hedge-fund managers and big oil. As Club of Rome wrote inits 1991 publication, The First Global Revolution, “The real enemy is humanityitself.”TRANSHUMANIST AGENDAAnother area of globalist agenda is transhumanism. As I explain inTransEvolution – The Coming Age of Human Deconstruction, transhumanism is anultra-high tech dream of computer scientists, philosophers, neural scientistsand many others. It seeks to use radical advances in technology to augment thehuman body, mind and ultimately the entire human experience. It is thephilosophy that supports the idea that mankind should pro-actively enhanceitself and steer the course of its own evolution.Transhumanists wish to become what they call “post-human.” A post-human issomeone who has been modified with performance-enhancing body and brainaugmentations to the point that they could no longer call themselves human. Theyhave mutated themselves into an all-together new being.Many people have trouble understanding what the true transhumanism movement isall about, and why it’s so awful. After all, it’s just about improving ourquality of life, right? Or is transhumanism about social control on a giganticscale?In fact, “social control” is exactly how powerful American foundations such asthe Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Endowment and Macy Foundation see it. Theability to make machines act like humans, and the ability to treat humans asmachines: “…the final accomplishment of H.G. Wells’ old Fabian goal of a‘scientific world order’ where everything is as neat as a differential equation,and unpredictable things such as human creativity never mess things up.”63To most people, this sounds like something from a science fiction film. Few areaware of constant breakthroughs in technology, which makes the transhumanistvision a very real possibility for the near future.For example, neurochip interfaces, computer chips that con- nect directly to thebrain are being developed right now. The ultimate goal of a brain chip would beto increase intelligence thousands of time over – basically turning the humanbrain into the super computer.Lifelong emotional well-being is also a key concept within transhumanism. Thiscan be achieved through a recalibration of the pleasure centers in the brain.Pharmaceutical mood renders have been suggested, which will be cleaner and saferthan the mind-altering drugs.The goal is to replace all aversive experience with pleasure beyond the doubtsof normal, human experience. Nanotechnology, for example, is a pivotal areaconcerning transhumanists. It is the science of creating machines, the size ofmolecules. Such machines could create organic tissue for medical use.Using this type of technology could dramatically prolong life span. The GlobalFuture 2045 International Congress predicted that by 2045, it will be possibleto live forever by combining technology and biology into an event called: “TheSingularity.”The Singularity would occur at the point in which artificial intelligencesurpasses the capabilities of the human brain. From cyborgs with very long lifespans, to downloading consciousness itself into a machine, transhumanists saythat it is impossible to predict exactly what a post-human will be, but that itwill be better. Such lofty promises are being embraced by many people – for abetter world for everyone.No matter how you look at it, Singularity is being promoted as the greatsolution to our 21st century global problems. And thanks to the human genomeproject, we will soon be able to decode DNA itself. Through the use of appliedgenetics, science will then be able to improve the human race. What most peopledon’t realize is that this concept is not new.Transhumanism was born out of humanism, which is yet another clever disguise of“scientism,” created specifically so that global eugenics operations could becarried out without being noticed.Artificial intelligence, the creation of thinking robots is closely related tothe mind machine merger concept of neurochips. There is a growing perceptionthat machine parts will be added to human bodies to create cyborgs, a terminvented by Dr. Nathan Kline, a psychiatrist linked to the CIA and MK-ULTRA. Hehad co- written an article with Manfred Clynes for the September 1960 issue ofAstronautics entitled “Cyborgs and Space” which first introduced the term‘cyborg’ into the English language.Still others believe that humanity will merge totally with technology byuploading individual consciousness to a virtual reality. Upon being uploaded,one could live forever within a computer-generated reality, leaving the physicalbody behind. In this machine, the individual could merge his intelligence withthe collective intelligence of all others in the digital reality, effectivelybecoming one super intelligent being. This concept is popularly referred to asthe ‘hive mind.’ How many people see the parallel with Jung’s ‘collectiveunconscious’? “Only through the recognition of the dimension of the collectiveunconscious can science serve the interests of man,” says Jung. Except thatvirtual reality and computers cannot replicate human intelligent thought. WhatAI can do, is to alter consciousness, in the same way that LSD altered anddegraded the human mind back in the 1960s.In the concluding chapters of Cybernetics, Wiener states the possibility of afuture with learning-capable, self-reproducing machines, much like that depictedby an Arnold Schwarzenegger cyborg, in the apocalyptic movie Terminator. But,like all computers or logical systems, all the decisions and policy of thosemachines will be nothing more than a logical deduction “from a set of rules andaxioms of its initial programmer. There is no possibility for discovery of a newuniversal principle of science”64 because the actual principles of humanknowledge are not confined to what is learned.As Johannes Kepler exhaustively explained in his The Harmonies of the World,“the human personality has access, by the unique nature of human mind’s uniquepower of cognition,” unique among all living creatures, “to generate previouslyunknown, validatable universal physical and comparable principles” whichincrease our species’ power in and over the universe per capita and per squarekilometre of space.To annul this unique nature of human mind, the parallel world of Jungian thoughtcan now be found intertwined with the ideas of New Age. From beer commercialsthat talk of the collective unconscious to the Star Wars series and massmarketed virtual reality, we are consciously building on Jungian imagery andmystical ideas. To them, “ this new technology is the key to open the doors ofperception to Jungian dream world.”65 However this Jungian Star Wars “dreamworld” is more like a recurring nightmare. The most crucial epistemologicalissue is often overlooked. Do these Star Wars, Doom and Lord of the Ringscreatures look human to you? The second issue is how do you corrupt people intoJungian mysticism? Obviously, by dehumanizsing the image of man. Therein liesthe principle of evil pervading “virtual consciousness.” Am I exaggerating?Let’s see.“If you can generate enough stimuli outside one’s sense organs to indicate theexistence of a particular alternate world, then a person’s nervous system willkick into gear and treat the stimulated world as real,” says Jaron Lanier of VPLResearch, Inc. Furthermore, if virtual reality technology is administered as abrainwashing tool, it can weaken what the Freudians call the ‘super-ego,’ thatpart of the personality that coheres to one’s moral conscience, which is thebasis for truth seeking on the one hand and the uniquely human act offundamental discovery and integration of new universal principles which haveimproved the lives of people per square kilometre of space against nature on theother. In fact, science has tried to drum out our built-in connection to theuniverse and replace it with ‘consensual hallucination’ through virtual reality.Virtual reality, we are told, creates an artificial world in which we are freeto do whatever we want without being accountable for our actions. If you want tohave sex with the computer-generated image of your neighbor’s dog, that’sperfectly all right, go ahead and have it in the virtual world. With theliberation of our repressed fantasies, if one is to believe Freudian claptrap,virtual reality produces a new consciousness that redefines good and evil. Inthe words of that other famous psychopath, Friderich Nietzsche, it is a universe“beyond good and evil.” Thus we are liberated to do evil “without suffering theeffect of evil and therefore purge ourselves of our innate desire to ‘be’evil.”66The fantasized pinnacle of transhumanist world provides us with the clearestview of its deadly ends, when seen through the eye of a physical world lackinguniversal truth and “the sacred responsibility of the sovereign individual toact for the Good.”67 And without universal truth, there can be no reason. Iftruth is killed, then our civilization is killed with it.TRANSHUMANIST AGENDA & THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRYAnother key issue of transhumanism is the fostering of a particular agenda asthe basis of forms of entertainment. A simple example of this can be found innumerous Hollywood films or television shows, which include robots or androids.They often make the viewer feel sympathetic towards the robot and in turn thismakes them feel emotional, if say, the robot were to be ‘killed’ by a human. Itsalso worth noting that it is almost always a human being causing these robots“pain.”For example, in Terminator and Short Circuit, this agenda is openly flaunted.The robotic characters in these films are shown to have good morals andhuman-like emotions throughout the entire movie. As a result, the viewer then,becomes attached and shows compassion and sympathy for them.So, how does it relate to the music industry?The universe and its composition are essentially made up of matter vibrating atdifferent frequencies. In essence, the universe is made up of sound, and thisincludes us human beings, too. Sound is widely used as a therapeutic tool andcan alter mental and physical states of human beings.Music activates nearly every region of the brain. The limbic system in the brainbegins to fire when we have a variety of pleasurable experiences. That samenetwork of neurons also fires when we listen to music that we enjoy. Theseneurons help to modulate levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain.Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters that eventually make you feel positive.So when you listen to music that you like, you get an actual change of chemicallevels in your brain. And this is why the music industry is also being used topush the transhumanist agenda. By having nearly every region of the brainactive, you become easily susceptible to psychological attacks, in this case, byyour own favourite artists.There are numerous examples of transhumanist agenda being pushed in the musicindustry. Take Rihanna’s live performance of ‘Rude Boy,’ for example. On stage,she performs with real dancing robots. These robots have absolutely nothing todo with the song. The purpose of that dance routine is to make the viewers feelas if the robots are sentient beings. The whole idea of the transhumanist agendais to make humans view inanimate objects and technology as being on the samelevel as a human being.Setting for a book: “God of Singularity springs out of a computer to rapture thehuman race. The math-magicians of British Intelligence calculate demons backinto the dark. And solar-scale computation just uploads us all into the happyever after.”68 The “God” is really just an Artificial Intelligence, just one ofthe plethora of post-humanizing changes and memetic subcultures that are comingon fast and that most people don’t even know exist.A cover of a well-known fashion magazine has a slimly clad young lady embracinga robot while meaningfully looking into his eyes. That’s what sexualizingtechnology is all about. This agenda is not about the improvement of the humanspecies but rather about the manipulation of the human consciousness, so thathuman beings no longer see themselves as human beings, but rather much like apiece of technology. By dehumanizing our species, we become the enemy. You maynot realize it, but Tavistock has long used Hollywood and the music industry astwo of its most potent tools in reaching out to the brainwashed masses in orderto change the historical paradigm of society. The next time you look at anall-knowing grin of a Tavistockian degenerate, just remember, that’s what theyare thinking about. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 1.

Some of the early works with science fiction themes such asNathaniel Hawthorne short stories shared a cautionary message that men shouldnot use science to interfere with nature. Later, these ideas were transformedinto science fiction films professing the idea of technology extinguishinghumanity through Armageddon-like disasters such as Hollywood’s The Day The EarthStood Still (1951), When Worlds Collide (1951), the three blockbusters DeepImpact (1998), Armageddon (1998) and The Book of Eli (2010). They provide a grimoutlook, portraying a dystopic view of the world in the advanced phase of decaysuch as Metropolis, filmed in 1927 with its underground slave population andview of the effects of industrialization on society.Frankenstein may have been the first science fiction novel; however, theoriginator of the science fiction genre without a doubt was H.G. Wells. At theend of the 19th century H.G. Wells gave us the War of the Worlds, which in 1953,over half a century later, would be transformed into a Hollywood blockbuster.Other notable science fiction titles by Wells are The Time Machine, The Islandof Dr. Moreau (1886) and The Invisible Man. But it took the televisionfranchise, Star Trek to bring science fiction into the mainstream. Star Trekmade travel through space more plausible than ever.However, a closer look at the themes of science fiction demonstrates that theentire genre is, not quite the source of collective enlightenment and a body ofimaginative literature it is made out to be, but rather, oriented towardssomething far more sinister in need of deconstruction. From stories of distantplanets, unknowable multi-dimensional universe, inexplicable forces, strange andextraordinary microscopic organisms or mutant monsters unleashed on the humanrace, either created by misguided mad scientists or by nuclear havoc such as inThe Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), impossible quests, improbable settings, of“parallel worlds,” of futuristic technology and alien intelligence far superiorto man, not to mention disaster stories about technologies that backfires formpart of a concerted psychological assault on people’s belief systems that thelaws of the universe are rational and therefore knowable to the human mind.These stories often portray the dangerous and sinister nature of knowledge(‘there are some things Man is not meant to know’) as is repeated continuouslyin countless ‘B’ movies such as Frankenstein, (1931), The Island of Lost Souls(1933), including the threatening, existential loss of personal individualitysuch as Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956), nuclear annihilation in apost-apocalyptic world in On the Beach (1959), are all assertions of theimpotence of the human mind before the vast, unknowable, and uncontrollablecosmos. Plots of space-related conspiracies such as Capricorn One (1978),supercomputers threatening impregnation in Demon Seed (1977), the results ofgerm-warfare in The Omega Man (1971) and laboratory-bred viruses or plagues suchas 28 Days Later 2002); then we have black-hole exploration as in Event Horizon(1997), and futuristic genetic engineering, human transformation and cloning inGattaca (1997) and Michael Bay’s The Island (2005).As science fiction writers themselves put it, their stories are designed to‘bend the minds’ – in other words, to destroy them. And, no wonder. Commonly,sci-fi genre expresses society’s anxiety about out-of-control technology,self-augmenting humanoid robots millions of times smarter than mankind, aliensdetermined to destroy humanity, kill switches and Artificial Intelligenceprotocols, depicting an eternal struggle of good versus evil that is played outby recognizable archetypes and warriors such as in Forbidden Planet (1956) andthe space opera Star Wars (1977) with knights and a princess with her galaxy’skingdom to save.If we are to believe Hugo Gernsback, founder of Amazing Stories, and the firstspecialist science fiction magazine in America said that “Not only is sciencefiction an idea of tremendous import, but it is to be an important factor inmaking the world a better place to live in, through educating the public to thepossibilities of science on life which, even today, are not appreciated by theman on the street.… If every man, woman, boy and girl, could be induced to readscience fiction right along, there would certainly be a great resulting benefitto the community, in that the educational standards of its people would beraised tremendously. Science fiction would make people happier, give them abroader understanding of the world, make them more tolerant.”1However, science fiction is not a literary form. It originated as, and remainsto this day, a sophisticated tool designed to entrap, disorient, and destroy thepromising creative minds of the younger generation who have ‘dangerous’illusions that are associated with belief in the idea of technological progressand the spirit of innovation. Once the belief in the power of human reason isgone, all potential for future scientific work is destroyed. The currentexplosion in the visual media has played a decisive role in modern sciencefiction films such as Lord of the Rings and Avatar. Today, more than half ofAmericans believe in the existence of UFOs and an entire movement has been builton the basis of replacing science and technology with futuristic scenarios.A recent CNN/Time Poll provides what is possibly the most dramatic confirmationof the destructive effects of almost a century worth of promotion of sciencefiction on the population. According to the poll, 80% of Americans believe thatthe government is hiding the existence of extraterrestrial life forms. 64%believe aliens have contacted humans. 50% believe that aliens have abductedhumans. 75% believe that a UFO crashed near Roswell. 26% believe that we shouldexpect to be treated as an enemy. 39% believe that aliens would appear veryhumanoid. 35% believe that aliens would look somewhat human. Almost 22% believethey have seen an Unidentified Flying Object themselves. Amongst the last groupof people, we have former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who allegedly saw one suchobject over his peanut farm in Georgia back in his pre-presidential days.Few people realize that the genre was laboratory-designed and imposed on theminds of American youth by the same financial and political interests whoearlier sponsored the drug trade and later, the counterculture movement in the1960s. What is perhaps even more surprising, is that special interest groupswith far-sighted agendas financed the world’s most recognizable names.THE EARLY DAYSH.G. Wells, head of British foreign intelligence during World War I and thespiritual grandfather of the Aquarian Conspiracy, was a protege of leadingDarwinist T. H. Huxley, founder of the British Round Table intelligenceorganization along with Cecil Rhodes. The Round Table is one of the ‘opensecret’ secret societies directly linked to the Black Guelphs, better known asthe House of Windsor. Another, is the Society of Carpocrates with its directlinks to Queen Elizabeth II, a Black Guelph through her grandmother QueenVictoria. The most important member of British Round Table was Baron HaroldAnthony Caccia whose family is one of the oldest families in the Black Nobility.In turn, Venetian Black Nobility was interlocked with a secret organization OC(Organizational Consul), controlled by the Thule Society, which functioned asthe ‘mother organization’ of a plethora of parties, societies, paramilitaryunits and terrorist groups. The ‘greatest’ creations of the Thule Society werethe Nazi Party and its degenerate leader, Adolf Hitler.Wells, the novelist, was a member of the elite British oligarchic planninggroup, the Coefficients. Both the Round Table and the Coefficients werecommitted to the establishment of a “feudal empire run by an aristocracy whichcontrolled all knowledge and technology and used them to rule over a populationof ignorant, drugged plantation slaves.”2The Coefficients were “a cross between a diners club and a modern think-tank,which met monthly over dinners at London’s St. Ermin’s Hotel from 1902 to 1908.Among the members of this group was the powerful Lord Robert Cecil, elderstatesman of Britain’s most powerful family, and cousin to Arthur Balfour, thenserving as Conservative Prime Minister. Lord Alfred Milner, the HighCommissioner of South Africa”3 also participated on a regular basis as well asHalford Mackinder, the newly appointed head of London School of Economics.Others involved were The Earl Bertrand Russell as well as Sidney and BeatrcieWebb, Fabian socialists and supporters of Mussolini.In other words, the crowd behind H.G. Wells, were some of the most powerfulempire builders belonging to the upper echelons of secret societies andfinancial interests.The Bilderberg Group, in fact was a natural extrapolation of the CoefficientsClub. Milner spoke of his vision for the future during a 1903 meeting, over halfa century before the Bilderberg Group was founded. At the meeting, Milnerstressed the point:“We must have an aristocracy – not of privilege, but of understanding andpurpose – or mankind will fail.… And here my peculiar difficulty with democracycomes in. If humanity at large is capable of that high education and thosecreative freedoms our hope demands, much more must its better and more vigoroustypes be so capable.… The solution does not lie in direct confrontation. We candefeat democracy because we understand the workings of the human mind, themental hinterlands hidden behind the persona.“We need constructive imagination working within the vast complex of powerfulpeople, clever people, enterprising people, influential people, amidst whompower is diffused today, to produce the self-conscious highly selective,open-minded, devoted aristocratic culture, which seems to me to be the nextnecessary phase in the development of human affairs. I see human progress, notas the spontaneous product of crowds or raw minds swayed by elementary needs,but as a natural but elaborate result of intricate human interdependencies, ofhuman energy and curiosity liberated and acting at leisure, of human passionsand motives modified and redirected by literature and art.”4In other words, educated masses are a horrible idea, because they would signifythe death of oligarchism. Nations that foster the creative-mental developmentsof their population produce a people which will not tolerate oligarchical formsof rule indefinitely. Illiterate, technologically backward populations will. Infact, one of the reasons for the creation of the science fiction genre had to dowith population density. By the middle of the 18th century, the Venetianoligarchy special interest groups throughout Europe realised that there was adirect relationship between levels of technological progress and populationdensity.As writer Ian D. Colvin said in his book, The Unseen Hand in English History,“The ruling motive in politics, as intelligent men know very well, is interest.Those resounding cries and plausible principles on which to the young and theinnocent the battle appears to be fought, are usually pretexts, the flag, thecolour of action; men and especially politicians, seldom reveal their truemotive, but nearly always wrap it in some virtue, faith or plausibleabstraction.”5Although anyone, who understands the deeper implications of the proverbial“corridors of power,” knows that in politics hardly anything happens withoutunwritten deals over purposeful plans. Yet, often when one speaks of a‘stringpuller behind the scenes,’ great howls of protest arise.Absolutely inimical to the implementation of the Round Table’s feudal one-worldorder was the development of sovereign republican nation-states, committed tothe development of their industrial and scientific prowess and to the moralcapabilities of their citizenry. “Indeed, technological backwardness arecontributing causes for the emergence of oligarchical rule. The very existenceof the young United States as a Federal Republic is a demonstration of thispoint. The average American was culturally and economically superior to theaverage Briton of the Eighteenth Century. Moreover, since nations which did notcompete technologically would be strategically inferior, even the statescommitted to oligarchism, such as Britain, were compelled to adopt fromtechnologically superior France that very same technological progress which theyhated to see in French hands.”6However, by the turn of last century, there were large populations, especiallyin the technologically robust USA, that could no longer be subverted by anappeal to religious mysticism. As Carl Jung pointed out, a new pseudoscientificbasis was needed for cult creation.Enter H.G. Wells. Beginning in 1894, Wells wrote a dozen science fiction novelsand over seventy short stories for the Pall Mall Gazette, owned by the VenetianBlack Nobility family, the Astors. This is the same family that years laterwould sponsor Hitler along with other leading American and British oligarchs.The most important by far was his War of the Worlds, the still-definitivetreatment of an invasion of earth by technologically superior beings, in thiscase from Mars. The point of the story is simple: man is threatened withextermination by an invading, superior force. The future is a Dantesque spiralleading us to Hell in a hand basket. Man finally defeats Martians, but notthrough our creativity and human intelligence, but rather by the natural actionof bacteria, itself a lowest of low forms of life.The sponsors of science fiction let their intentions be known: Men were beasts,technology was impotent, and the highest product of the centuries-long struggleof man to govern his affairs according to the law of progress, the sovereignnation state, was to be replaced by a universal feudalist order. Thus, “theessential method of ‘dumbing down’ of subject population is the vicioussuppression of the creative powers of reason, those distinctively human mentalcapabilities which are expressed typically in the form of validaxiomatic-revolutionary discoveries in physical science.”7 With so much atstake, however, more than Wells was needed to transform a vibrant Americanpopulation with visions of grandeur into a corral filled with docile collectionsof tamed human cattle. The strategy was simple and effective – retard creativityin all fields and slow down the rates of economic and scientific progress. Thus,it was in the editorial columns of science fiction magazines that a firstcritical theory of science fiction was put to the test.Another character heavily involved in moulding the minds of the young towards aspecific goal outlined by the oligarchy was an emigrant from Luxembourg, HugoGernsback, a fellow of the British Royal Society who emigrated to the UnitedStates in 1904. In 1926, Gernsback founded Amazing Stories, itself the firstspecialist science fiction magazine in America, thus creating the first crop ofAmerica’s science fiction writers.Through magazines such as Amazing Stories and later Astounding Stories, sciencefiction “would boldly express what science did not yet dare to affirm orsuggest, and even what it would find absurd. It would develop the social,ethical, metaphysical or purely logical consequences of science, or set out toconfirm its ideological assumptions. In such a perspective, the literature ofscience fiction would be a continuation, albeit purely verbal and conceptual,imaginary and anticipative, of the real scientific work that itself sometimesuses fictions in the form of so-called ‘thought experiments.’”8The next big hit in the science fiction publishing belonged to AstoundingStories, edited by John W. Campbell. Campbell was a physics graduate of MIT andDuke University and a close associate of U.S. Naval Intelligence operative L.Ron Hubbard, a small-time science fiction writer, would-be occultist and thefounder of the cult of Scientology. Virtually every successful U.S. sciencefiction writer was groomed by Campbell, including Isaac Asimov, TheodoreSturgeon, A.E. Van Vogt, a leading Scientologist, Frank Herbert as well asBritish author Arthur C. Clarke in part due to the forcefulness of Campbell’spersonality by which he would bend his authors to his own objectives and in partbecause he paid more cents per word than anyone else in the business.Campbell’s entire stable consisted of authors with strongly anti-scientific biasof science fiction and its links to the British establishment. For example, oneof them was Robert A. Heinlein, an Annapolis graduate and a “skilledpsychological warfare operative with close ties to Naval Intelligence that alongwith Air Force Intelligence has very close interfaces with the Britishintelligence services.”9In 1960, Heinlein was re-deployed into the MK-ULTRA drug proliferation projectand in 1961, he came out with Stranger in a Strange Land. The theme deals with aMartian boy, Valentine Michael Smith, the son of astronauts, orphaned on Marsafter the entire crew died. “Smith was raised in the culture of the Martiannatives, beings with full control over their minds and bodies. A secondexpedition to the planet some twenty years later brings Smith ‘home’ to Earth.Since he is heir to the fortunes of the entire exploration party, which includesseveral valuable inventions, Smith becomes a political pawn in governmentstruggles. On Earth, he withdraws into a trance-like state of another plane ofexistence,”10 in other words, into a state of higher consciousness, whenever heis bothered by society. The book became the bible for the drug culture that wasbeing organized by Gregory Bateson, Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary.The most famous of the genre’s writers is Isaac Asimov. A firm believer inMalthus’ doctrine of depleting natural resources, a theme he addressesrepeatedly in his works such as The Caves of Steel, for example, Asimov wasbrought in to work with Heinlein at the Naval Experimental Lab during World WarII. Asimov’s most important work is The Foundation trilogy, about two smallelite groups, one specialised in high technology and the other in psychologicalwarfare, “who tuck themselves away on a hidden planet and wait for the expectedcollapse of the galactic empire. The two groups are modelled on Britain’sTavistock Institute and the hidden Aldermaston labs, from which all scientificresearch and development on the British Isles is controlled.”11One of the few non-American authors in the Campbell stable was the legendaryArthur C. Clarke, a graduate of King’s College at Cambridge and a veteran of theRoyal Air Force radar program.12 He was a conscious disciple of H.G. Wells andscience fiction mystic Olaf Stapleton. Clarke’s best known work is 2001, A SpaceOdyssey. The novel’s theme of transcendent evolution is attributed to theinfluence of British author Olaf Stapledon. It describes how all human progressis due to intervention from a superior alien race. Clarke is also the author ofthe best selling novel Childhood’s End, in which a superior race of alienscalled the “overlords,” invades the Earth, ending all war, helping to form aworld government, and turning the planet into a near-utopia from the safety oftheir space ships. Decades later, the “overlords” show themselves, judginghumanity and deciding to merge the human race into the “disembodied cosmicvortex.”CARL SAGAN AND COSMOSNo matter how you look at it, there are only two sides to the UFO debate: youeither believe it or you don’t. About the only person the mainstreamEstablishment media trusted to speak of UFOs, astrology, and cults was the lateCarl Sagan. In 1980, the landmark series Cosmos premiered on public television.Since then, according to the promotional material on the series, “it isestimated that more than a billion people around the planet have seen it. Cosmoschronicles the evolution of the planet and efforts to find our place in theuniverse. Each of the 13 episodes focuses on a specific aspect of the nature oflife, consciousness, the universe and time. Topics include the origin of life onEarth (and perhaps elsewhere), the nature of consciousness, and the birth anddeath of stars. When it first aired, the series catapulted creator and host CarlSagan to the status of pop culture icon and opened countless minds to the powerof science and the possibility of life on other worlds.”13It doesn´t take 13 episodes to establish, however, that pure science is notexactly what the series Cosmos is promoting. From jumping dolphins choreographedto Wagner’s Valkyries to psychedelic galaxies and futurologist drawings, fromsinging whales and Hindu gods, there is a dialectical change from real scienceto Sagan’s Cosmos, which takes us deep into the world of mysticism. In place ofreal science, which has always been an expression of mankind’s moral commitmentfor human progress through mastery of the natural universe – Cosmos proposes anAquarian-Dionysian version of science based on existentialist touchy feelyenvironmental irrationalism where all involved would participate in a commoncosmic consciousness. Where did Sagan people draw the line between a psychedelicexperience and quackery? In this sense, Cosmos copies the ideas from FriedrichGeorg Junger’s The Perfection of Technology, written in 1939. Junger writes:“Technology fills the air with smoke, pollutes the water, destroys forests andanimals. This leads to a condition in which Nature must be protected fromrational thought.” In other words, what these kooks can´t understand aboutnature, must therefore have no explanation, except of course if you acceptextraterrestrial ramblings as plausible scientific hypothesis.The essence of science are the methods by which discoveries are made, called themethod of hypothesis was developed in ancient Greece. “The core of this methodis the belief that the laws of the development of the universe are coherent withthe human mind’s own notion of lawfulness, so that the truth of the universe isfundamentally knowable to man.”14 Instead, Sagan adopts a consistent form ofdistortion in order to focus the audience’s attention away from the coherence ofman’s mind. How does he do that? By attempting to break the universe down into acollection of objects, just as Euclid and Aristotle did before him. That’sbecause ideas, to Carl Sagan, occur in a space devoid of reality. “Only thus, inunopposed emptiness could better elements be joined together in a continuousconstruction.”15 But, people are not nominalists on this account. Through thecoherence of our mind, we know what we have experienced, and can identifyexistences as corresponding to such experiences without needing to break theexperience into a collection of names because our real knowledge is that of ourhuman, creative relationship to processes, not things.For all man’s science, proclaims Sagan, he is but a speck of dust in thevastness of the cosmos. Suddenly, we see “Sagan sailing through space in aflying saucer, assuring us that somewhere out in the vastness there exists life,perhaps superior civilization, trying to communicate with us, visit us...orperhaps they already have.”16 And just to make sure, we lower humans know ourplace in the universe, on page 313 of Cosmos, Sagan offers us a computer summaryof extraterrestrial civilizations, and our place in ‘the great chain of being.’The barrier is breached between this world and the next, an initiatic rending ofthe veil of the unknown: space being seen as the domain of both the dead and thehigher spiritual force. Suddenly, the vivid colors of the artist’s drawing begintwisting, growing, shrinking, and changing colors, like a hallucination of anLSD acid trip.In case the LSD and extraterrestrial do not work, try some Hinduism for achange. Again, let us refer to Cosmos’ production for further information: “TheHindu religion is the only one of the worlds great religions dedicated to theidea that the cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number ofdeaths and rebirths... There is a deep and appealing notion that the universe isbut a dream of a god, who after a hundred Brahma years (each 8.64 billions yearslong) dissolved himself in a dreamless sleep. The universe dissolves with him –until after another Brahma century, he stirs, recomposes himself, and beginsagain to dream the great cosmic dream. Meanwhile, elsewhere, there are aninfinite number of universes, each with its own god, dreaming the cosmicdream.”17But Sagan doesn´t end there.“These profound and lovely images are, I like to imagine, a kind of premonitionof modern astronomical ideas ... It is by no means clear that the cosmos willcontinue to expand forever...If there is more matter than we can see – hiddenaway in black holes... then the universe will hold together gravitationally andpartake of a very Indian succession of cycles, expansion followed bycontraction, universe upon universe, cosmos without end.”18Instead of asking relevant questions that deal with mankind’s place in theuniverse, Sagan takes us on a drug-induced space ride into oblivion. Through thepower of television alchemy, Cosmos turned Sagan into a prophet. It is time thatsomeone unmasked the idiocy of what fools had feared as the Mighty Wizard of Oz.It is not surprising that this media extravaganza was funded by individuals andorganizations closely linked to the same Aquarian Conspiracy crazies, like theAspen Institute’s Robert O. Anderson, who created the environmentalist movementthrough institutions such as Club of Rome, Friends of the Earth, WWF and WorldWatch Institute.World Wildlife Fund, an organization created by the British Royal Consort,Prince Philip, aggressively portrays wild animals as ‘better human beings,’compared to humans and modern industrial society. Amongst the people associatedwith WWF is the internationally renowned director of the Frankfurt Zoo, a manwho once said that Earth would be lovable, if the human population were no morethan 20 million.But the excitement, the interest and the attention to real progress in spaceexploration, cannot be killed through kookery, science fiction, budget cuts orcultural warfare. What the mind benders at Tavistock don’t seem to understand isthat the human spirit is far more resilient than their zero growth,environmentalist agendas. We choose to explore space, not because it is easy,but because it is hard. This has always been man’s destiny.The Cosmos series was funded through a grant to the Public Broadcasting Systemof more than $1 million from the Atlantic Richfield Company. Chairman Robert O.Anderson and President Thornton Bradshaw are among the most prominent andinfluential American opponents of scientific, technological and culturalprogress. Since the mid 1960s, the policy faction of which these two are membershave been committed to the success of what was known in the 1960s as theAquarian conspiracy, the undermining of society through the antiwar,environmentalist and drug and rock counterculture movements and is todaycommitted to de-industrializing America to bring us back to the new Dark Age.The age of scientific rationale – characterized in Marilyn Ferguson’s book TheAquarian Conspiracy as the Age of Pisces – will now be cut off by the Age ofAquarius.For most of PBS’ history, funding was provided by AT & T, a CFR company; ArcherDaniels Midland, a Trilateral Commission company; PepsiCo, a CFR company whoseChief Executive Officer, Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi is a Bilderberg and aTrilateral Commission Executive Committee member; and Smith Barney, a CFRcompany and one of the world’s leading financial institutions. Therefore, youwould hardly call PBS a non-profit, family oriented enterprise owned andoperated by America’s public television stations, would you?What’s more, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), Anderson and Bradshaw have beenparticularly active in the environmentalist efforts of the Aquarian Conspiracy.Anderson personally funded the first Earth Day in 1970 to the tune of $200,000to create the“grassroots” friends of the earth movement in opposition totechnological progress. Hundreds of millions of dollars went into Earth Day1970, a vast public relations stunt to get the green movement off the ground.Earth Day was bankrolled by the United Nations, Atlantic Richfield, the Ford andRockefeller foundations and directed by the Colorado-based Aspen Institute ofHumanistic Studies, one of the most important planning centers playing a dubiousrole against technological progress and the destruction of nuclear energy andspawning of the environmentalist zero growth operations.Both Anderson and Bradshaw are leaders of Aspen Institute for HumanisticStudies. Aspen created the first antinuclear movement and devised the Malthusianenvironmentalist belief system that science and technology are intrinsicallyevil inflicted by man on nature. The two ARCO executives are also members of theexclusive Club of Rome, the leading international institution pushing polices ofretrogression in technology, and reduction of the world’s population by severalbillions of people – that’s genocide, in case you didn’t know it.Founded in April 1968 by Alexander King and Aurelio Peccei, as a Malthusianorganization with an agenda for genocide, the Club of Rome, established at ameeting of 30 individuals from ten countries, consists of the oldest members ofVenetian Black Nobility of Europe, descendents of the richest and most ancientof all European families who controlled and ran Genoa and Venice in the XIIcentury. In 1972, they published their manifesto on the Predicament of Mankindunder the title, Limits to Growth, which showed that Earth could not sustain thecurrent population expansion in the age of depleting natural resources. Thefinal objective is the collapse of the world economy, even with their version of‘unlimited’ resources, which includes zero technological advancement in science,or development of revolutionary new technologies. If you break through theBabylonian verbal confusion, their 1992 report, The Global Revolution: A reportby the Club of Rome Council leaves little room for doubt as to their realagenda: “In search for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea thatpollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the likewould fit the bill.” They concluded with the following, “The real enemy, then,is humanity itself.”In other words, the financial capitalists who launched a Carl Sagan from acollege professor with bell bottom jeans to an intergalactic superstar are theorganizers of the same antiscientific policy Sagan’s series Cosmos peddles.Sagan’s services were popularized as part of a willful attempt to eradicatescientific progress because the idea of ceaseless progress in favor of a betterfuture is anathema to the oligarchs behind the curtain.But the weirdness doesn’t end there.Sagan was one of the founding members of something called the Planetary Society.According to their own web page, “The Planetary Society, founded in 1980 by CarlSagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, inspires and involves the world’spublic in space exploration through advocacy, projects, and education. Today,The Planetary Society is the largest and most influential public spaceorganization group on Earth. Dedicated to exploring the solar system and seekinglife beyond Earth, The Planetary Society is non-governmental and nonprofit andis funded by the support of its members.”Sounds wonderfully promising, except that from the very beginning, the board ofadvisers included a group of the leading spokesmen for the Aquarian Conspiracy’senvironmentalist and de-industrial campaigns in the United States. Among themIsaac Asimov, the Malthusian science fiction writer; Norman Cousins, editor ofthe Saturday Review and member of the Club of Rome; John Gardner, chief of theenvironmentalist Common Cause organization and president of Rockefellerinterfaced Carnegie Corporation; Shirely Hufstedler who sat on the board ofAspen Institute; and Lewis Tomas, leading advocate of euthanasia.19 What’s thecommon theme to their participation? Zero growth, zero progress idealism of itsleading members.THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL IMPERATIVEThirty years ago, space scientist Krafft Ehricke proved that the alternative ofa no-growth policy would lead to a collapse in civilization: “geopolitical powerpolitics, wars over natural resources, waves of epidemics, death-orientedpopulation stabilization and extreme poverty.” To combat the no-growth policy,Ehricke developed the concept of extraterrestrial imperative to confront theattack on mankind from the proponents of Malthusian theories of scarcity. Thecentral concept Ehricke developed is “the distinction between multiplication andgrowth.” In a 1982 article, Ehricke stated that “growth, in contrast tomultiplication, is the increase in knowledge, in wisdom, in the capacity to growin new ways.” It literally turned Club of Rome’s genocidal Limits to Growthreport on its head. Ehricke pointed out that the Malthusians never considered“space exploration as domain of man’s activity because to them, Earth is aclosed system.”20That’s because as Ehricke himself wrote in an 1973 article on his mentor HermannOberth, “The development of an idea of space travel was always the most logicaland the most noble consequence of the Renaissance ideal, which again placed manin an organic and active relationship with this surrounding universe and whichperceived in the synthesis of knowledge and capabilities its highest ideas...The concept of ‘limit’ and ‘impossibility’ were each relegated to two clearlydistinct regions, namely the ‘limit’ of our present state of knowledge and the‘impossibility’ of a process running counter to the well understood laws ofnature.”21Countering the anti-science description of the view of the Earth by the Apolloastronauts on their way to the Moon, as a ‘fragile’ globe that mankind is‘destroying,’ Ehricke wrote, “Earth is not merely a spaceship. It is a member ofthe Sun’s convoy traversing the vast ocean of our Milky Way galaxy... Ourcompanion worlds are underdeveloped. Earth is the only luxury passenger liner ina convoy of freighters loaded with resources. These resources are for us to use,after Earth has hatched us to the point where we have the intelligence and themeans to gain partial independence from our planet.”22Indeed, there are whole new worlds for us to explore, about which we know verylittle; an exploration, which should keep us busy for a few hundred generations.And this is exactly what the anti science platform through Sagan and Aspen andWWF and H.G. Wells has been trying to avoid at any cost.THE COMING OF THE UFOSWe are back to where we started, staring at the ‘doors of perception,’ enmeshedin a labyrinthine task of connecting the dots. From past chapters, we connectedthe dots to the involvement of intelligence agents in the field of Egyptianarcheology to the study of the paranormal, OSS operations, psychologicalwarfare, Paperclip scientists, JFK assassination... a kind of grab bag ofgovernment-approved operations and would include everything from séances andwitchcraft to remote viewing and exotic drugs. And either we agree with JFKprosecutor Jim Garrison that such coincidences are evidence of an intelligenceoperation or that the coincidences represent something else: an “acausalconnecting principle” to use the phrase invented by Carl Jung, that nonethelessdemonstrates important linkages between events in the world.For example, Hungarian-American physicist, Theodore von Kármán and NASA teamfirst test rocket in the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena on October 31, 1936. October31, the night of Halloween and coincidentally, the same day as the last Houdiniséance. Those who think that perhaps the first rocket launch on Halloween wassimply a coincidence should refer to the official JPL website where they statethat the American space age began on “January 31, 1958 with the launch of thefirst US satellite, Explorer I, built and controlled by JPL.” And as PeterLevenda aptly connects the dots in his underground best seller, Sinister Forces,“January 31, of course, is the pagan holiday known to Christianity as Candlemasand to pagans as Oimelc. Thus, for better or for worse, meaningful or not, thelaunch that took place on Halloween, 1936 culminated in the launch on Candlemas,1958, and was the result of the work of the same organization, for von Kármán’sGALCIT team eventually became the founding members of the Jet PropulsionLaboratory. The man in charge of the Explorer launch was Dr. Wernher von Braun,the Nazi scientist formerly of Peenemunde and Nordhausen.”231947 is a pivotal year in the postwar period. This was the year CIA was created;the year the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered and the year Winston Churchillmade his famous “Iron Curtain” speech, thus declaring the beginning of the ColdWar. It is the year that US Navy begins project CHATTER, the search for a viabletruth serum, a magic potion to unlock the secrets of the mind. It is the yearthat the greatest Satanist of the 20th century, Aleister Crowley died. And, ifwe are to believe the Beatles, it is the year that Sergeant Pepper’s Bandlearned to play.It was the year of the famous Roswell, New Mexico UFO crash. More – or less –than meets the eye? Extraterrestrial, spaceships, ‘men in black,’ visitors fromothers planets and the UFO phenomenon disembarked onto the front pages ofAmericans newspapers and in no time all Hell broke loose.The 1947 UFO Roswell sighting attracted two men – a former OSS officer Fred LeeCrisman,24 and former FBI Special Agent Guy Bannister – who both would comeunder suspicion twenty years later for their supporting roles in the Kennedyassassination. “Crisman and Bannister, two men friendly with a large list ofpeople who later would be a part of the conspiracy to assassinate the President.The odds against this happening must be astronomical. It is the constantappearance of ‘coincidences’ like these that leave most people apoplectic,speechless with disbelief and gazing on the world around them with haunted,suspicious expressions, as if reality itself were layered like an onion, apalimpsest on which numerous events were written over each other, all on thesame page.”25 In this case, we have Operation Paperclip, UFOs, and the Kennedyassassination all written on the same sheet of onionskin parchment. Nazis,aliens and political murder. One can almost sympathize with Pontius Pilate, whoasked “What is the truth?” – and the temptation to wash one’s hands of the wholematter is almost too strong.One of the accusations levelled at UFO eyewitnesses is that their testimony istainted by reason of inexperience, lack of professionalism, lack of knowledge ofastronomical phenomena, etc. In other words, they are not scientists, military,police or establishment with credentials, that is the people in charge ofdetermining the contours of our everyday reality. What would happen if you couldparade a perfect witness or a series of them in front of the worldwide audience?Would that make a difference in how we perceive the UFO phenomenon?CREATING CONSENSUSThe role of Air Force Intelligence is revealed by examining the pattern ofrecorded major UFO sightings worldwide between 1947 and 1973. “Of the 145 U.S.sightings, fifty four were claimed by the military: forty six by the Air Force,six by the Navy, one by the Army, and one by the Coast Guard. The modus operandiis clear. A couple of Air Force colonels announce they have seen a flyingsaucer. This makes headlines, and suggestible people everywhere begininterpreting every flying light they see as a UFO. Such UFOs make headlines innational papers which leads to more and more stories on UFOs. In case thingsslow down, a top Air Force official steps forward and announces that he isresigning from the force and will reveal all the information about alienspacecraft that the military has secretly kept hidden. The resignation of ViceAdmiral Roscoe Henry Hillenkoetter, United States Navy, a decorated war hero andthe former director of the CIA, in 1960 is one such case.” Hillenkoetter quithis job at NICAP (National Investigative Committee of Aerial Phenomena, the mostprestigious of all UFO investigative groups) within days of a CIA investigationof his proposed role in opening the UFO investigation at the Congressional levelthrough the Senate Science and Astronautics Committee with support of senatorslike Barry Goldwater. “Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers aresoberly concerned about the UFO’s,” Hillenkoetter said.26UFO promoter Jacques Vallee describes the effects of the UFO hoax in detail inthe pages of his Messengers of Deception:“1. The belief in UFOs widens the gap between the public and scientificinstitutions.“2. The contactee propaganda undermines the image of human beings as masters oftheir own destiny.“3. Increased attention given to UFO activity promotes the concept of politicalunification of the planet.“4. Contactee organizations may become the basis of a new ‘high demand’religion.“5. Irrational motivations based on faith are spreading hand in hand with thebelief in extraterrestrial intervention.“6. Contactee philosophies often include beliefs in higher races and intotalitarian systems that would eliminate democracy...Strong belief inextraterrestrial intervention could revive this primitive concept, withparticular groups claiming privileges peculiar to those who descend from stellarexplorers.”27Vallee is a close working associate of Profesor Ron Bracewell, who along withMK-ULTRA operative John Lily, astro-mystic Carl Sagan and NY Times scienceeditor Walter Sullivan, author of We Are Not Alone, is a member of the Order ofthe Dolphin, founded in 1961 to promote the idea of the existence of superioror, extraterrestrial civilisations. Another kook who belongs to this group isAmerican astrophysicist, Frank Drake, founder of SETI, a group whose primaryobjective is thes Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence by using the Drakeequation, an equation used to estimate the number of detectable extraterrestrialcivilisations in the Milky Way galaxy.THE ENDThere is something enigmatic about asking questions. Questions have a way offraming the future. Through The War of the Worlds, H.G. Wells asked thefollowing: “Well then, someone may say, if there are globes in the heavensimilar to our earth, do we vie with them over who occupies the better portionof the universe? For if their globes are nobler, we are not the noblest ofrational creatures. Then how can all things be for man’s sake? How can we be themasters of God’s handiwork?”I have to admit these wouldn’t have been my questions. I would want to know,“How do we change the world?” “How do we become immortal?”In the late 1950s, scientist Lloyd Berkner, who had accompanied Admiral RichardByrd on his Antarctic expedition in 1928, stated his vision for the future:“Science is creative beauty in the highest sense. It provides a systematic andreliable criterion of universal applicability in Plato’s search for the‘harmonious, the beautiful, and the desirable....’ Truly, the characteristic ofcivilized man that distinguishes him from all other creatures is his learning,the ability to utilize knowledge to free himself from the vicissitudes of hisenvironment.”Long before Club of Rome became a nightmare reality, Berkner anticipated theirargument regarding the ‘cost-benefit’ of space exploration: “Each new technologyderived from science has a permanence that continues to benefit societyindefinitely in the future. Thus capital represented by discovery outlives allother forms. Consequently, the investment in basic research should be writtenoff over an indefinitely long time against the permanent gains acquired bysociety.”28This is not what the oligarchy and Tavistock wanted to hear. In the mid-1960s,the Tavistock Institute’s magazine, Human Relations reported, with alarm, thatthe space program was producing an extraordinary number of ‘redundant’ and‘supernumerary’ scientists and engineers. “There would soon be two scientistsfor every man, woman, and dog in the society,” they warned. “The expanding poolof these scientists and engineers would have a profound impact on the values ofAmerican society, from skilled workers to office clerks,”29 Tavistock reported.Between the late 1950s and late 1960s, people all over the world, watched inawe, as man conquered space. And as Marsha Freeman explains in her great exposeon Mankind’s Next 50 Years Of Space Exploration, “It was not only scientists andengineers, and children who, by the thousands joined rocket clubs, spendingweekends launching amateur rockets, who were infected with the optimism of theApollo program. In 1962, the editors of Fortune magazine, reflecting the view ofAmerican industry, published a book, The Space Industry: America’s Newest Giant,which included a chapter titled, “Hitching the Economy to the Infinite”:“There is no end to space, and so far as the U.S. economy is concerned, therewill probably be no end to the space program.... Man has hitched his wagon tothe infinite, and he is unlikely ever to unhitch it again.... The space venture,in short, is likely to be more durably stupendous than even its most passionateadvocates think it will be.… Overall, nothing is more fecund, industrially andsocially, than large mobilisations of scientific knowledge and effort; and thisis the greatest mobilisation of them all.”30Our mortal life has a beginning, and an inevitable end. What, then, is ourimmortal interest in being a person? Can we consider immortality to be anapproximation of infinity? “When we generate, and transmit, discoveries ofprinciple, to our children, to those who come later, we live forever in thehistory of mankind. Our mortal existence is no longer a matter of a beginningand an end: Our mortal existence is a place in eternity, from which we radiatethe experience of generations before us, and radiate our existence into thefuture.”31In a speech in Texas, on Jan. 19, 2007, NASA Administrator Mike Griffin gave hisview on space exploration. The real reason we stride to better ourselves isbecause “we want to leave something behind for the next generation, or thegeneration after that, to show them that we were here, to show them what we didwith our time here. This is the impulse behind cathedrals and pyramids and many,many other things.... It is my observation that when we do things for realreasons, we produce our highest achievements.”Griffin continued: “The cathedral builders knew that reason... We look backacross 600 or 800 years of time, and we are still awed by what they did....”He ended by saying, “It is my contention that the products of our space programare today’s cathedrals. The space program addresses the real reasons why humansdo things. The cathedrals of the second 50 years of the Space Age are waiting tobe built. This will require nothing less than the philosophical view of mankindwhich created the cathedrals of centuries past, and of the first half-century ofspace exploration.”Against the generalized euphoria of legitimate space exploration and thebetterment of mankind against future generations, the Aquarian-Dionysian versionof science based on existentialist environmental irrationalism, psychedelicexperience, quackery and common cosmic consciousness stands exposed for what itis – a sophisticated tool designed, on the one hand, to entrap, disorient, anddestroy the creative minds of the younger generation who have ‘dangerous’illusions that are associated with belief in the idea of technological progressand the spirit of innovation and on the other, to displace man from his rightfulplace in the Universe – the epicenter.Truth always lies in the higher order of processes. True sovereignty lies not inpopular opinion, but in the creative powers of the individual human mind. Theonly defense we have against the mind benders is to develop our own mentalcapabilities – individually – as a firewall against psychological warfare andcultural colonialism. Demons, God... Aliens and us.And so it goes.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 1.
