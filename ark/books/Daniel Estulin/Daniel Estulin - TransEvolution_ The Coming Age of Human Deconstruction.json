It is a time of great innovation and technologicaladvancement. It is also a time of chaos and conspiracies: a time of financialmeltdown across the world, a time of mass population displacement, and a timewhen the rich are becoming immensely richer and more powerful and more fearfulby the day. In 2015, corporations have more power than any government on theplanet. These corporations have bankrupted the governments and have made themsubservient to the interests of the moneyed elite. The final merging of OneWorld Company Inc. is finally upon us.“The Golden Age of cheap energy has passed. Competition for energy supplies”1dominates the economic landscape. Environmental degradation, the intensificationof agriculture, and pace of urbanization has reduced the fertility of arableland. Food insecurity is causing mass migration on a global scale. There issevere water scarcity in some of the world’s most densely populated areas –India, China and Pakistan, provoking disputes in already volatile regions thatis triggering military action and large scale population movements.Humanity is in peril. Change is inevitable. It’s not the end of the world, butyou can see it from here. You can feel it in the air and touch it with yourfingertips.What does our future look like? Tomorrow? In one year? In one generation?Several top-secret government studies, both in the United States and the UnitedKingdom, predict an eerie future: Over the next 25 years, the world will turninto a Big-Brother nightmare where small, rich elite thrives on the backs of astarving population.“The concepts of democracy and freedom will have disappeared only to be replacedby a high-tech dictatorship based on surveillance, monitoring, mass-mediaindoctrination, police oppression and a radical division of social classes. Thevast majority of the citizens live in third-world country conditions and areconstantly subjected”2 to poverty, famine, sickness and extermination.By 2015, the elite see the opportunity to advance mankind towards a new Dark Ageby taking the reins of Darwin’s perversely racialist “survival of the fittest”natural selection evolution theory and applied social principles to developsocial Darwinism.To most, this may read like a plot from a dystopian Hollywood science fictionfilm, but I assure you this is real. It is all around us.These are the conclusions of a report prepared by the British government. InDecember 2006, UK´s Ministry of Defense prepared a secret source document on thefuture of humanity. The report itself was based on top-secret negotiations thattook place at the conclusion of the 2005 Bilderberg Conference at the DorintSofitel Überfahrt hotel in Rottach-Egern, Germany. This group was handpicked bythe Bilderberg steering committee in January 2005; long before the Bilderbergconference took place during three and a half days beginning on May 5.After most of the attendees had left on the afternoon of May 8, a small, selectgroup of Bilderbergers had retired to an exclusive Ringberg Castle, overlookingthe Tegernsee in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps. The castle was a creationof Duke Luitpold in Bavaria, a member of the Wittelsbach family who ruledBavaria for over 800 years.Five months before, at a January 2005 Bilderberg pre-selection meeting, nationalrepresentatives of the Bilderberg group were asked in absolute secrecy to puttogether a working group and prepare detailed reports on population, on naturalresources availability, on conflict prevention, on economic issues, etc. Theconclusions of the report, along with the conclusions of the Bilderberg meetingin May would be further discussed during the secret May 9 and 10 meetings at theRingberg Castle.Nobody, except the Bilderberg steering committee and a select group ofBilderberg´s most powerful members knew that this post-Bilderberg meeting eventook place. The meeting would define the future of humanity and its objectiveswere no less than Promethean.The people selected, were the cream of the crop of the Bilderberg elite: itslongtime Chairman, Etienne Davignon, Vice Chairman of Suez-Tractebe; FranciscoPinto Balsemão, Former Prime Minister of Portugal and one of the mostinfluential behind the scenes operators on the supranational level; DavidRockefeller, a man who needs no introduction; Timothy F. Geithner, at the timePresident of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and later Treasury Secretaryin the first Obama administration; Richard N. Haass, President of the powerfulUS think tank Council on Foreign Relations; Victor Halberstadt, Professor ofEconomics at Leiden University and Bilderberg´s former Chairman; Allan B.Hubbard, Assistant to the President Bush for Economic Policy and Director of theNational Economic Council; James L. Jones Supreme Allied Commander Europe SHAPE;Henry Kissinger; Henry R. Kravis, Founding Partner Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.and his wife Marie-Josée Kravis Senior Fellow at Hudson Institute; Queen Beatrixof the Netherlands; Matias Rodriguez Inciarte, Executive Vice Chairman GrupoSantander representing the Botin family interests; Peter D. Sutherland,Chairman, Goldman Sachs and British Petroleum; Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor ofthe European Central Bank; Jacob Wallenberg, representative of Sweden’s mostpowerful family; James D. Wolfensohn, President of The World Bank and PaulWolfowitz, at the time President designate of The World Bank.These men and women were planning no more and no less, the future of mankind.What they decided behind closed doors of the Ringberg Castle would two yearslater become the backbone of the most far-sighted report in human history.Using the British government as a once removed, deniable cutout, StrategicTrends 2007-2036, the 91-page report is a blueprint for UK´s future strategicnational requirements through the analysis of key risks and future shocks to theworld’s financial, economic, political, demographic and technological areas andmarkets. The principal output of the report focused on cross-dimensionalanalysis of the future context for defense over the period of one generation.The Strategic Trends report is the backbone of the United Kingdom’s Defensepolicy. The future, according to the report, “is characterized by a bewilderingnumber of interrelated variables.”3By 2015, over 50% of the world’s population will be living in urban rather thanrural environments. The report states, “There will be a substantial growth inshanty towns and unplanned, random urban settlement, increasing the resourcecost and environmental impact.”4Poor housing, weak infrastructure, visible marginalization, social deprivation,differential levels of poverty and a sense of grievance will increase insignificance and become major political issues, “based around transnationalmoral justice agendas, including violent activism of varying intensity andimpact.”5The report states explicitly that:> > In all but the most affluent societies, most of humanity will continue to> > experience hardship… and absolute poverty will remain a global challenge.6The report goes beyond identifying the potential future military threats, andlooks at the developments in areas that will shape the wider strategic contextwithin which Defense will have to interact. Key theme of the report addressespopulation and resources of the planet Earth. In stark terms, it outlines:> > … an increased risk of humanitarian catastrophe caused by a mixture of> > climate change, resource pressures, uneven distribution of wealth, the> > effect of disease and the failure of authorities to cope with population> > growth and urbanization.7In one generation, between 2007 and 2036, world’s population explosion will gofrom 7 billion people to almost 10 billion with less developed countriesaccounting for 98% of world population growth. By 2036, nearly two-thirds of theworld’s population will be living in areas of water-stress. The lack of food,water, medicine, proper hygiene, education and basic human necessities couldspell – collapse.Without mincing words, the report states explicitly:> > … growing gap between majority and a small number of highly visible> > super-rich is likely to pose an increasing threat to social order and> > stability. Faced by these challenges, the world’s under-privileged might> > unite, using access to knowledge, resources and skills to shape> > transnational processes in their own class interest.8The result of the growing desperation on the part of humanity will result in“civil war, intercommunal violence, insurgency, pervasive criminality andwidespread disorder.”9Faced with the financial markets on a downward spiral to Hell and a globaleconomic collapse, the report predicts “a severe pricing shock, possibly causedby an energy spike or a series of harvest failures,”10 which would “trigger adomino effect involving the collapse of key international markets across a rangeof sectors.”11 The impacts of this collapse, transmitted throughout theglobalized economy, could result in a breakdown of the international politicalsystem and complete economic collapse.Does that mean all of humanity is in peril? No, it does not. Because even withthe “erosion of Civil Liberties,” the super-rich will be protected through“technological advancements and pervasive surveillance.” Coupled with“intrusive, highly responsive and accessible data-bases, the emergence of aso-called ‘surveillance society’ will increasingly challenge assumptions aboutprivacy, with corresponding impacts on civil liberties and human rights.”12With the destruction on nation-state republics and the creation of mega economicblocks linked to each other through a globalized marketplace, independentcountries will be “replaced by Mega Cities.” The report defines a Mega City as a“large city in a developing region” with a population base of over 20 millionpeople. Caused by a massive population displacement, cities will swell tounimaginable proportions “which will already have experienced endemiclawlessness and high levels of violence.”13Unable to cope with an influx of peoples, the Mega Cities:> > … will fail before 2035. The effects will be equivalent … to state failure,> > which city failure may, in turn, precipitate.14Based on recent experiences in the United States, the military stabilization ofa major city could demand Martial Law, or as the report deceptively states: “… acomprehensive Inter-Agency approach, specialist skills, and an enduringoperational commitment.”15Technological advancement and supremacy will require that wars be fought notstate-on-state basis, but rather as an “endemic Urban-Based, Irregular Conflictagainst adversaries with highly-developed urban survival and combat skills.”16These are called social turbulences.Social TurbulenceA theory of social turbulence, a so-called “softening up effect of futureshocks” was developed by two prominent psychologists, Eric Trist and FrederickEmery – wherein a population could be softened up through mass phenomena such asenergy shortages, economic and financial collapse, or terrorist attack. “If the‘shocks’ were to come close enough to each other and if they were delivered withincreasing intensity, then it was possible to drive the entire society into astate of mass psychosis,” claimed Trist and Emery. They also stated that“individuals would become disassociated, as they tried to flee from the terrorof the shocking, emerging reality; people would withdraw into a state of denial,retreating into popular entertainments and diversions, while being prone tooutbursts of rage.”How does the Strategic Trends report deal with social turbulence, mass psychosisand the softening up of the population?> > Increasingly, regular military forces will deploy in environments where> > armed irregular forces, for example armed followings, gangs, bandits,> > semi-official militias, Private Military Companies (PMCs), terrorists and> > insurgents, are operating, often as adversaries, but sometimes as neutrals> > or even as partners.17This is called breaking the morale through the strategy of terror.In fact, we are talking about two sides of the same coin here. On one side,guiding the covert, subtle manipulation and control of thought and humanconsciousness through the power of television in particular and entertainment ingeneral; “employed on an ever growing list of those deemed as enemies of Americaas well as on a confused and agitated American public – whose corporate newsnetworks frame and manage an increasingly shallow narrative while engaging in akind of Orwellian Kabuki Theatre of fairness and balance;”18 while “on the otherside, directly and overtly shifting the paradigm, changing the basic concepts,widening the parameters, and changing the playing field and all the rules ofplay by which society defines itself within an exceptionally short period oftime.”19One of the key individuals involved in psychological warfare against thepopulation through manufactured social turbulence is Kurt Lewin, a pioneerin-group dynamics who was part of the early Frankfurt School and fled Germanywhen Hitler took power. This passage from his book Time Perspective and Morale,shows his understanding of psychological warfare:> > One of the main techniques for breaking morale through a ‘strategy of> > terror’ consists in exactly this tactic – keep the person hazy as to where> > he stands and just what he may expect. If in addition frequent vacillations> > between severe disciplinary measures and promises of good treatment together> > with spreading of contradictory news, make the ‘cognitive structure’ of this> > situation utterly unclear, then the individual may cease to even know when a> > particular plan would lead toward or away from his goal. Under these> > conditions even those who have definite goals and are ready to take risks,> > will be paralyzed by severe inner conflicts in regard to what to do.20Over the past 50 years, research in the fields of psychology, sociology andpsychiatry has shown that there are clearly marked limits to the amount ofchanges, and the nature of them that the mind can deal with. According toScience Policy Research Unit [SPRU] at Tavistock’s Sussex University facility,“future shocks” is defined “as physical and psychological distress arising fromthe excess load on the decision-making mechanism of the human mind.” In otherwords:> > … a series of events, which come so fast that the human brain cannot absorb> > the information.”21 One scenario is called superficiality. After continuous> > shocks, according to Emery and Trist, the large targeted population group> > discovers that it does not want to make choices any more, reducing the> > “value of his intentions…. This strategy can only be pursued by denying the> > deeper roots of humanity that bind … people together on a personal level by> > denying their individual psyche.22Apathy takes over, often preceded by mindless violence such as is characteristicof the Los Angeles street gangs in the 1960s and the 1980s, what Emery and Tristcall organized social response to dissociation, as described in the pages ofAnthony Burgess’ novel A Clockwork Orange, a society dominated by infantileanimal like rage. “Such a group becomes easy to control and will docilely followorders without rebelling, which is the object of the exercise,” add Trist andEmery. What’s more, the dissociated adults cannot exert moral authority overtheir children, because they are too involved with their own infantilefantasies, brought to them through their television set. And if you doubt what Iam saying, look at the older generation today as they have accepted the moraldecadence of the no-future generation of its children, rather than seekconflict, and in the process, the adults have come to accept a lower moralstandard.Just as in Aldous Huxley’s drug-controlled Brave New World, there are no moralor emotional choices to make here, the “flower children” and the drug soakedrebellion of the Vietnam era is a perfect example of how this scenariofunctions.These “frequent vacillations” pass through several scenarios: “Stable, at whichpoint, people more or less are able to adapt to what is happening to them, or itis turbulent, at which point people either take actions to relieve the tension,or they adapt to accept tension-filled environment. If the turbulence does notcease, or it is intensified, then at a certain point people cease being able toadapt in a positive way. According to Trist and Emery, people become maladaptive– they choose a response to tension that degrades their lives. They start torepress reality, denying its existence, and constructing increasingly moreinfantile fantasies that enable them to cope. Under the conditions of increasingsocial turbulence, people change their values, yielding to new degraded values,values that are less human and more animal-like.”23The second scenario is “segmentation of society into smaller parts. In thisscenario, it is every group, ethnic, racial, and sexual against the other.Nations break apart into regional groups, those smaller areas in turn fissureinto even smaller areas, along ethnic lines.”24 Trist and Emery refer to it as“enhancement of in-group and out-group prejudices as people seek to simplifytheir choices. The natural lines of social divisions emerge to becomebarricades.”The Strategic Trends report has an answer for that as well. Increasinglynon-state actors:> > … will be wielded by a broader spectrum of individuals and agencies, even by> > criminal, terrorist and insurgency groups as a means of complementing their> > more coercive, violent activities. These groupings will be highly volatile,> > dissolving either when interests are achieved, or when more favorable> > opportunities present themselves, with those least constrained by legal> > accountability or moral considerations the most likely to be effective at> > manipulating the use of Soft Power.25Society’s response to such a psychological and political disintegration is theOrwellian fascist state, modelled on George Orwell’s book 1984. In the book,“Big Brother” regulates the lives and conflicts of people within a society; anever ending conflict:> > … is waged by each ruling group against its own subjects, and the object of> > the war is not to make or prevent conquest of territory, but to keep the> > structure of society intact.26This never-ending conflict is foreseen in Strategic Trends report.> > Information Communications Technology, ICT, is likely to be so pervasive> > that people are permanently connected to a network or two-way data stream> > with inherent challenges to civil liberties; being disconnected could be> > considered suspicious.27The growing pervasiveness of ICT will enable communities of interest to beestablished rapidly and for the quick and coordinated mobilization ofsignificant numbers of people.> > Rapid mobilization – ‘Flash mobs’ – may be undertaken by states, terrorists> > and criminals, and may involve dispersed communities across international> > boundaries, challenging security forces to match this potential agility and> > ability to concentrate.28Crucially, “this level of sophistication will require a concerted, comprehensiveapplication of all the instruments and agencies of state power, together withcooperation from all relevant authorities and organizations involved in settlinga crisis or resolving a conflict.”29 What does it mean? It means, Martial Law.With resistance broken, the third “future shocks” scenario is the most intense,involving a withdrawal and retreat into “private world and a withdrawal fromsocial bonds that might entail being drawn into the affairs of others.”30 Tristand Emery are convinced that men will be willing to accept “the perverseinhumanity of man that characterised Nazism.” Not necessarily the structure ofthe Nazi state, but the moral outlook of Nazi society.To survive in such a state, people will either have to submit to the state or gounderground. Again according to the Strategic Trends report,> > All likely future opponents will have recognized the advantages of going> > underground if they wish to avoid the surveillance, targeting and> > penetrative capabilities of sophisticated military forces, particularly> > those deploying air platforms and systems. In future, states will seek to> > site most of their major nodes and the majority of their decisive fighting> > power underground. Similarly, irregular opponents will base themselves in> > underground networks, both for offence and defense, especially in complex> > urban spaces.31Techniques for overcoming resistance, comprehensive application of all theinstruments and agencies of state power, rapid mobilization, “Flashmobs,”pervasive Information Communications Technology, segmentation of society,endemic lawlessness and high levels of violence, intrusive, highly responsiveand accessible data-bases, the emergence of “surveillance society,” erosion ofCivil Liberties, humanitarian catastrophe.This is what the near future looks like. We instinctively reject suchconclusions, even if they are supported by solid evidence in aBilderberg-authored and government-prepared secret report. “However, we musthave the courage to let the evidence tell the story, because, as the reader willlearn, what is at stake is not simply our view of reality. Whether or not ourworldview is challenged, or shattered, by the revelations in this material,doesn’t change the truth of the matter, which is that the conspiracy is real,that it is ongoing – and that September 11, 2001, was just a prelude to whatthey have planned for us.”32We are truly at the gates of Hell. And the roads we take will now terminatewhether we will live in the XXI century as nation state republics or subjugated,culled and dehumanized crop of slaves.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1http://www.resilience.org/stories/2007-02-27/dcdc-global-strategic-trends-programme-2007-2036.2 Ibid.3 DCDC Strategic Trends Report, p.v.4 Ibid, p. 9.5 Ibid, p. 13.6 Ibid, P. 33.7 Ibid, p. 6.8 Ibid, p.80.9 Ibid, p.68.10 Ibid, p. 78.11 Ibid.12 Ibid, p.61.13 Ibid, p. xii.14 Ibid, p.28.15 Ibid, p. 30.16 Ibid.17 Ibid, p.70.18 Elizabeth Gould and Paul Fitzgerald, “9-11, Psychological Warfare and theAmerican Narrative,”http://www.boilingfrogspost.com/2011/08/10/911-psychological-warfare-the-american-narrative-part-i/.19 John Quinn, NewsHawk, 10 October, 1999.20 K.

And physical includes thefact that the human brain, which is unlike any other brain. No animal can file apatent – only human beings can do that. That is one of the ways in which weorganize our social system – by adopting social customs, as to how we behave aspeople, as human beings. And, if we have defective customs, we are going to haveproblems – and these problems are foreseeable.Dear reader, I want you to understand that what we are witnessing in the worldtoday – the wholesale destruction of the world’s economy – is not an accident,nor is it a miscalculation or the result of political shenanigans. This is beingdone on purpose, absolutely on purpose. The reason is because our currentcorporate empire knows that “progress of humanity” means their imminent demise.Empires cannot survive in a world where there is widespread technological andscientific progress. An imperium requires a world where people are dumb andservile like sheep. Empires seek to destroy the very structures, such asnation-states, which support meaningful life and human progress. The“powers-that-be” deliberately target these nation-states (independentcountries), and their economies – to destroy the nations, and therebymaintaining their own imperious power. This is by design.Empires are not a King or a Queen sitting on a gold plated throne. Empires areabove Kings. It is a system of control – total control. The control ofeverything by an international monetary system that is itself run by theinternational banks.Globalization, you see, is nothing but a new form of empire, with the goals: theelimination of the nation-state, the elimination of liberty, and the eliminationof rights.Now, I know many people will comment: “What empire? Empires ceased to exist along time ago.”Our current imperium is a complex system of central banks, investment banks,hedge funds, private equity funds, insurance companies, and shadow banking. Afinancial system that has been responsible for a paradigm-shift in the last halfa century, away from the production of physical goods and real economy, and moreand more to speculation, to the idea of profit maximization, and puremonetarism. That’s todays’ Empire!How Money WorksLike I said before, the economy has nothing to do with money. What the elitehave created is an Empire – with them in control. Too many believe that is allabout money. But money is simply an instrument. Money, in itself, doesn’t affectthe development of the planet. There is a false belief that there is anintrinsic value expressed by money, but the value expressed is not as a quantityper se. It is only the relative effects of its increase, and/or decrease of itsphysical potential relative to the population-density of a society. The value ofmoney lies not in its individual exchange, but in its function as a unifyingdynamic of the social processes of a nation.What affects the development of our planet? The human mind. That is how mankindis measured. What separates us from animals is our ability to discover universalphysical principles, which then increase and improve humankind. Our minds allowus to innovate, and subsequently improve the lives of our populations. Thedevelopment of mankind, the development of the power of individuals and thenations, depends upon scientific development, scientific discovery andtechnological progress.By cutting down productivity, by disrupting investment in infrastructure, and byforestalling inventions and technology, the elite wish to force a populationreduction. Because if you keep people stupid, and not too numerous, a minoritymay excercise near total control.Today’s monetary crisis reflects the insanity that has been imposed during theprocess of destroying the physical economy. The reason we are having this“crisis” is not because of fluctuation in the financial markets. But because weare in a hyperinflationary mode: if you take the total amount of money purportedto be in circulation, and you take the percentage of that money which has acorrespondence to physical reality, and you find it is diminished – almost tozero. But that is not the problem! It is our per capita physical production, andthe fact, that the resources on which production depends, have collapsed.The future of mankind comes from our physical economy, and the physicaltransformations that we make from the world that surrounds us. Let me give youan example. You take a pile of dirt, which is rich in iron ore, and you refinethe ore, and you use that ore to make iron, and then you use that iron to makesteel, and you use the steel to make machine tools that then allow you to buildall sorts of other things: automobiles, trains, space shuttles, nuclearreactors. You have forged ahead.At each step of the process the transformation you get has greater value tosociety, is worth more in physical terms than what went into it. The output ismore than the sum of the inputs.You see, when we build infrastructure, we are actually reorganizing the physicalspace-time of the planet, allowing our world to attain higher and higher levelsof efficiency and beauty.So, if your system is increasingly moving to higher levels of efficiency, suchas from a coal based economy to an oil based economy to a nuclear based economy,there would be an increase in the productive power of human labor at every stepof the way –that’s the way that actual wealth is created. People doingproductive things. Money is simply the way of facilitating trade among people.It possesses no magical powers. No intrinsic value.Why Is The Empire Destroying The Financial System?There are currently seven billion people on Planet Earth, a small blue orbmeandering through space with limited natural resources and an ever expandingpopulation. Food and water are becoming ever scarcer.For example, according to a study by NASA, Gravity Recovery and ClimateExperiment, India’s water tables have fallen by about one-fifth over the pasttwo years.1 India’s agricultural sector currently uses about 90% of its totalwater resources. As water scarcity becomes a bigger and bigger problem, Indiacould be faced with catastrophic food shortages.Soon India may be forced to import more food from abroad. With a population of1.2 billion people, the tiny food surplus that exists in the world today wouldvanish immediately, creating an unsustainable situation for the world at large.The elite understand this. David Rockefeller understands this. The Kings and theQueens of the world understand: a larger population equals fewer naturalresources and more food and water supply shortages.In fact, the elite, the oligarchic controllers of empire throughout Europe,understood this by the middle of the eighteenth century: that levels oftechnological progress and development are directly proportional to populationgrowth. Without scientific and technological progress, a level of populationincrease cannot be sustained because with an ever-expanding population, you needmore and more sophisticated technology to sustain the populace.And with technological progress, oligarchies are not tolerated. Nations, whichfoster the creative-mental development of their populations, produce a peoplethat will not tolerate oligarchic forms of rule indefinitely.Therefore, from the point of view of an oligarchical elite, if they want tocompletely control a planet, they must reduce the population to a more“manageable” number. Remember, seven billion people and growing is a lot ofmouths to feed. This is something that Rockefeller and company understands, evenif we don’t. For the elite to eat, you and I have to die. How is that for asolution?Depopulation & Club of Rome’s “Limits to Growth”The most important institution in the world to push a Malthusian depopulationscheme is the Club of Rome. Its members are some of the leading citizens of theplanet: David Rockefeller, Michael Gorbachev, the King and Queen of Spain,Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Philippe of Belgium.Founded in April 1968 by Alexander King and Aurelio Peccei, the Club of Rome,mainly consists of members of Venetian Black Nobility, descendants of therichest and most ancient of all European families. They controlled and ran Genoaand Venice in the XII century.In 1972, the Club published one of the most pernicious documents of all time,The Limits to Growth. The report declared that Earth was going to run out of itslimited resources during the next 40 years. Therefore, according to thisaccount, in order for mankind to survive, we would have to adjust our lifestyle,and numbers, accordingly.According to the Club of Rome, in order to survive, mankind must reduce itsdependence on technology; roll back its drive for progress, technologicalinnovation and advancement, and impose a worldwide regime of economic controlleddisintegration.> > Since that time, the Limits to Growth thesis has been inserted within> > government and supranational government institutions worldwide, so-called> > educational institutions, university curricula, and much more – basically> > every aspect of popular culture. The results have been the total> > deindustrialization, wars, and genocide we see today.2The end result is the collapse of the world economy, and even with their versionof “unlimited” resources, which includes no breakthroughs in science, or thedevelopment of any revolutionary new technologies. If you break through theBabylonian verbal confusion, a report by the Club of Rome leaves little room fordoubt as to their real agenda: “In search for a new enemy to unite us, we cameup with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages,famine and the like would fit the bill.” The report concluded with thefollowing, “The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.”Thus, a leading international institution is pushing policies of retrogressionin technology, and the reduction of the world’s population by several billionpeople – that’s genocide – in case you didn’t know it.However, before they can reduce population and tame the herd, they must destroythe world’s economy by destroying consumer demand, which is accomplished bymaking us all poorer.You may wish to know why Rockefeller and company would want to destroy demand.Wouldn’t they suffer financially as well? The answer is no. They will not sufferat all, because they already control most of the world’s wealth. Their primaryconcern at this juncture in history is to ensure the survival of their breed.And once more, for them to survive in an age of depleting natural resources,most of us must die.* * *We have all heard of the Great Depression. However, many of us haven’t beentaught our own history and do not understand what happened during that period.Contrary to what “official” history books tell you, the Great Depression was notan event that wiped out U.S. capitalists. It was an event that made the richricher, transferring the wealth of the people into the hands of an alreadywealthy elite.The Bank of America made billions through real estate foreclosures from 1929-37.Don’t believe for a minute that the richest of the rich will be hurt by anyeconomic collapse. The only ones hurt will be you and me.A question arises, how do they destroy demand? By destroying the world’s economyon purpose. In other words, “controlled disintegration.” Which was precisely thecornerstone of another policy paper prepared by another elite group: the Councilon Foreign Relation’s Project 1980s. Controlled economic disintegration and thedismantling of the globe’s advanced scientific industrial concentrations were amajor component of that report. CFR, one of the oligarchy’s central institutionsin the United States, called this project, “the largest undertaking in itshistory.”> > The 33-volume CFR report constituted blueprints, which the oligarchy used> > its power to institute during the second half of the 1970s and the 1980s.> > They imposed one of the most profound shifts in economic and nation-state> > policy during the 20th century – the paradigm shift to a post-industrial> > economy.3What does “controlled disintegration” mean? The world economy would be pushedinto collapse – but not in an haphazard fashion. With the oligarchy controllingthe disintergration process, it would be necessary to deliver economic shocks tocarry this out: oil price hikes, credit cutoffs, interest rate instability.Forcing the world economy to zero, and eventually negative growth rates.Simultaneously, there was the creation of the spot market in oil, of the eurobond markets, the derivatives market, and the expansion of the offshore bankingapparatus as well as the laundering of large quantities of drug money throughsome of the world’s largest banks.Over the past several years, some of the world’s largest banking institutionshave been caught laundering billions of dollars in illegal proceeds from thedrug trade through their accounts: Wachovia Bank, HSBC, Citigroup, and evenCoutts, the Queen of England’s private bank.Behind this entire initiative there appears the Inter-Alpha Group of banks. TheInter-Alpha Group, since its founding in 1971 as a European banking cartel byLord Jacob Rothschild, has been an epicenter of operations – all directed fromLondon. The Inter-Alpha Group includes financial heavyweights such as the RoyalBank of Scotland, the Portuguese Banco Espirito Santo, the Spanish BancoSantander, the Dutch ING, the French bank Société Générale and Germany’sCommerzbank, among others.The group was actually created in the later stages of World War II. JacobRothschild directed it from London. The Rothschild banking network, since itsinception in Frankfurt in late 1700, has been an operation of the BlackNobility, a global financial conglomerate conspiracy that dates back to theFourth Crusade.One of Rothchild’s first sponsors was the Thurn und Taxis family of Bavaria,controllers of the Venetian intelligence and one of the principal families ofthe Habsburg Empire of Austria.This Venice connection is the true source of financial power of the legendaryRothschild family.Despite the enormous wealth that these banks represent by themselves, they didnot have all the funds necessary to transform the world according to their plan.They provided the initial capital, and then used their power of controlling themoney of others, to create the markets and the institutions used to controlworld markets. This group originated the hedge funds, the private equity fundsand other domineering financial tools – the dark side of the Inter-Alpha Group.To achieve its objective, they first built a banking unit in postwar EuropeWorld War, as the base of what appeared to be a new universal financialstructure. However, it was actually a return to an imperial model that existedbefore the American Revolution. The planning of this new Europe began evenbefore the fighting ceased, and soon led to the creation of the European Coaland Steel Community in 1951, and then the formation of the European EconomicCommunity in 1957. These were initial crucial steps towards today’s EuropeanUnion and its supranational currency, the euro.With these measures and their subsequent elimination of national sovereignty,this new/old economic empire began the process of building a borderless Europeanfinancial system. In quick succession, came the development of the Eurobond andthe Eurodollar markets, and mega-banks. These banks, mostly based in London,merged with other British banks and banks based in Europe, Asia and theAmericas. These mega-banks were designed to flank national banking regulations,and as such, represented the beginning of “globalization” (i.e. imperialization)of finance.The real power of the Inter-Alpha Group, however, is not in the individual banksthemselves, but in the changes that the Inter-Alpha operation has fomented inthe world economy. The Inter-Alpha project turned the global financial systeminto a giant casino: a theme park for the investment banks,which are the“speculative arm” of the commercial banks and hedge funds.Trilateral CommissionAnother organization closely linked to the Bilderberg Group and the Council onForeign Relations is a little understood entity – the Trilateral Commission(TC). David Rockefeller established the organization in 1973. The people whobelong to the Trilateral Commission all appear to share the sameanti-nationalist philosophies, and to try to prevent the internal nationalisticforces within their respective countries from exerting influence on policy.Setting up the TC became Rockefeller’s plan to encourage:> > … unity among the industrialized powers, so that together they could achieve> > his goal of a more integrated global political and economic structure.4Rockefeller strategy “also reveals something fundamental about wealth and power:it does not matter how much money one has; unless it is employed to capture andcontrol those organizations that produce the ideas and the policies that guidegovernments and the people who eventually serve in them, the real power of agreat fortune will never be realized.”5Despite the primarily financial nature of Trilateral Commission’s motives andmethods, their political goals haven’t changed in forty years:> > Although the Commission’s primary concern is economic, the Trilateralists> > have pinpointed a vital political objective: to gain control of the American> > Presidency.6One of Trilateral Commission’s most notable recruits was candidate and laterPresident, Jimmy Carter. For the complete story on Carter’s selection forPresident, please see The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.Once the Trilateral Commission’s Jimmy Carter was installed as President, theoligarchy transferred the CFR’s Project 1980s into his administration. The toppersonnel of Project 1980s became the top leadership of, and beginning in 1977ran the government of Jimmy Carter. Two of the Project’s nine directors, W.Michael Blumenthal and Zbigniew Brzezinski, were appointed Treasury Secretaryand National Security Adviser, respectively. Cyrus Vance, who headed a Project1980s working group, was appointed Secretary of State. And Paul Volcker,spokesman for Project 1980s’ “controlled disintegration” policy, became FederalReserve Board chairman.7> > Starting the week of Oct. 6-12, 1979, Volcker began raising interest rates> > through raising the federal funds rate and increasing certain categories of> > reserve requirements for commercial banks.

You bet it does.1973 Bilderberg Meeting and a Planned Oil HoaxIn early 1973, the dollar was falling and the French, the German and theJapanese economies were really beginning to boom. In the beginning of 1973, theWest German deutschmark had already smashed the British pound and by July-Augustwas on its way to gaining hegemony over the ailing US dollar.In May 1973, the Bilderberg Group met at an exclusive resort at Saltsjobaden,Sweden:> > Certain elites connected with the money center banks in New York decided> > that it was time for a major shock to reverse the direction of the global> > economy, even at the cost of a recession in the American economy – that> > didn’t concern them so much as long as they were in control of the money> > flows.9The key point on the Bilderberg meeting agenda was the oil shock of 1973 – the400% targeted increase in the price of OPEC oil in the near future.

The dollarfloated up on a sea of oil. We need to remember that Nixon broke the link of thedollar with gold unilaterally in August of 1971, and after that time it hadplunged by some 40 per cent against the major trading currencies like theDeutsche Mark and the Japanese Yen. What saved the dollar? What saved WallStreet and the power of the dollar as a financial entity? It was not the U.S.economy by any means, it was the 400 per cent OPEC price hike.The price shock halted growth in Europe, and smashed the industrialization ofthe developing countries in the Third world, which had been enjoying a rapidgrowth dynamic in the early 1970′s. The massive oil price increase tilted powerinto the direction of Wall Street and the dollar system.All of that was aimed at continuing the systemic imperial process of looting theactual productive wealth of the major nations of the planet. This price hikescheme ultimately created an enormous volume of wealth transfer, nominally intothe OPEC countries, the so-called petro-dollars, but the money went to Londonand Wall Street to be managed. Thus, the financial oligarchy, in the majorcenters, used the oil-price hoax to establish an absolute domination over theworld’s credit system, and to make sure it no longer went to civil and culturaldevelopment.They used it to:> > … fund operations to transform the United States from within, including the> > takeover of the U.S. banking system and the cartelization – under the> > euphemism of mergers and acquisitions – of corporate America.

Once someone makes a decision to create a bubble,basically it is a pyramid scheme. De-linking the financial gains from the realeconomy, which is what you have to do if you are killing the real economy, andif you want to build up a speculative bubble, you have to divorce it fromreality, and derivatives are a way to do that.It’s like creating a game at a casino table. Derivatives are side bets on themovements of various things like bonds, the value of bonds, interest rates, andcurrency rates. You speculate on all these things, and you can bet on thosespeculations.The End of the Line> > As the speculative bubble came to dominate the U.S. and world economies,> > feeding it became paramount.

You find many euphemisms for imperializationbecause imperialization is a bad word. In 1968 at the Bilderberg conference inCanada, George Ball, a senior managing director for Lehman Brothers as well asthe Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs with JFK and President LyndonB. Johnson, announced a project to build what he called the “World Company.”The idea world globalists like to promote is that nation-states are outmoded andan archaic form of government, and that in a Malthusian world they can’t berelied on to address modern needs of society.> > For Ball, the very structure of the nation state, and the idea of> > commonwealth, or of a general welfare of a people, represented the main> > obstacle against any attempt of freely looting the planet, and represented> > the most important impediment to the creation of a neo-colonial world> > empire.14In other words, according to Ball and others in the Bilderberg Group, theresources of any country do not belong to that country, but to the World CompanyIncorporated run by the Elite.And so what is needed is a new form of government, one that will more freelydistribute the world’s resources. And that new form of government they decidedis the corporation.What George Ball called the World Company could then become a new governmentthat would greatly surpass, in authority and power, any government on theplanet.What we have seen from this cabal has been the gradual collapse of the USeconomy, beginning in the 1980s.> > The corporate raiders, financed by the dirty-money junk bond network, bought> > up significant chunks of corporate America, and terrified the rest.

Beginning late1960s into the 1970s and 1980s, the USA and the rest of the world was taken overby this rash of mergers, an ever-larger consolidation of industrial companies,of agricultural companies, of financial companies. They were slowly buildingthese giant cartels to the point where we see now, today, giant cartels whichcontrol the resources of the world – effectively running the world.Bankers are running the corporations, and their cartels. These cartels controlthe necessities of life, and they are now more powerful than nations. This wholeWorld Company project, in a sense, is a return to the old monopolistic days ofthe British East India Company with a modern computerized face. What shouldfrighten people most is: the elite have actually done what they announced theywould do, way back in 1968. Doesn’t that scare you?Let me give you an example of what One World Company means. Take Royal DutchShell (RDS), this mega-corporation is a product of union between the largestBritish and Dutch petroleum interests.Royal Dutch Shell’s World War II chief, Henri Deterding was a notorious backerof Adolf Hitler. RDS’s banker, Lazard created Banque Worms out of aShell-connected transport company. Banque Worms was seen as a notorious Vichyregime supporter and financial backer. Furthermore, Royal Dutch Shell has fundedcultural warfare operations against the United States, and the rest of theworld, the so-called “dumbing down of society,” including the creation andsubjugation of the environmentalist movement, which is given a “role” in thepost-industrial gang. Playing on people’s hopes for a better world.RDS shares an interlocking directorship with the Dutch ING bank; Dutch chemicalcompany Akzo Nobel; Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch group that controls large chunks ofworld’s food production; and Rio Tinto, which along with Anglo-American controlfrom 10 to 24% of the Western world’s minerals output. RDS also sharesdirectorship with Boeing, Lloyds Bank, UBS and AXA (one of the world’s largestinsurance companies).The British part of the Royal Dutch Shell is BP, British Petroleum. BP, sharesan interlocking directorship with Royal Bank of Scotland, and HSBC (which wasrecently caught laundering billion of dollars of Mexican drug money), AkzoNobel, Unilever, Roche pharmaceutical, and Goldman Sachs (whose former employeeMario Monti was the one time unelected caretaker Prime Minister of Italy), RollsRoyce, General Electric, Bank of America, Lloyds Bank, KPMG and GlaxoSmithKlinepharmaceutical company.On the next level down, many of these companies are further interlocked amongstthemselves. For example, HSBC is interlocked with BP as well as Shell, goldproducer Anglo-American, Financial Times, one of the leading business papers inthe world, the Economist, Imperial Chemical Industries, GlaxoSmithKline, RollsRoyce and Kleinwort Trust through a major German investment bank DresdenKleinwort Benson.Furthermore, each and every one of the above mentioned corporations, areinterlocked amongst themselves, creating an unbreakable, self-perpetuatingsystem, a virtual spider-web of interlocked financial, economic and industryinterests with the World Company model at the center. A fondi system.2009 Bank BailoutDo you remember the 2009 bank bailout? What was the real reason why the bankruptbanking sector was bailed out? Were Wall Street and the US Government trulythinking of “saving America” as they said? Or was there another reason to it?In fact, hidden from the public, there was a far more sinister reason for thebailout. Please understand the bailout was a massive fraud. Under the guise ofsaving the economy, the bankers transferred huge amounts of debts from privatehands, from the banks and other powerful interests to the books of thegovernment, and because the economy is continuing its collapse, this debt isabsolutely unpayable.Let me say it again. There is no way that this debt can ever be paid, so theeffect of the bailout will be to bankrupt governments. The real purpose of thebailout is to finish the destruction of the governments that the Inter-Alphaprocess began decades ago.In the second decade of the 21st century in Europe you have seen, for example,all of the negotiations over trying to save debt, to renegoiate debt, and onenation after another are falling to corporatist dictatorship. Control is thereal reason for the bailout. You are watching the nations of the world beingdestroyed and being replaced by fascist (corporate)dictatorships – aninternational global fascist imperial dictatorship.In Europe, the bank bailout followed this pattern. European banks were among themain beneficiaries of an around $16 trillion bailout that came from various Fedfunds in 2008. For instance, six of the first eleven beneficiaries of the TermAuction Facility (overnight Fed funds) were European banks, including SociétéGénérale and Royal Bank of Scotland. This unseemly operation was undereportedand no one asked any hard questions. How did the Federal Reserve justify this?It appears that the Federal Reserve had their reasons, because they simply liedabout what they were actually doing. The public was told one thing, but not whatwas actually being done. The Fed was clearly trying to save a system – thecorporate imperial system. They are not trying to save just US banks or theywouldn’t give all this money to foreign banks. They worked to save the system,which is what they feel they have to do.With the global system swamped with derivatives, if it blows up anywhere, itblows up everywhere. So, they have to protect the weakest links, it’s likeputting out house fires. You have to put the fire out, wherever it breaks out,otherwise the whole place can burn down.Please understand: the billion dollar bailouts were never meant to protect theeconomy, be it of the United States or of Europe. The bailouts have always beenabout protecting a monopolistic financial imperium and institutionalizing(obtaining government “guarantees”) the derivatives casinos. It is aboutpromoting the disease and sacrificing the patient.* * *Another thing I am personally witnessing in 2013 in Europe, especially in Spain,but not only limited to Spain is the fact that the banks are buying a great dealof sovereign debt. The question many would ask is: Can that debt ever be paid?If not, why are they doing this?If you and I wish to borrow money from a bank, the first thing the bank wouldwant to know is, can we pay it back? However, in a parallel world, the world ofWorld Company Incorporated, it appears the banks are buying debt because theywish to bankrupt nations. It is an old Venetian shell game: have your adversarygo so far in debt to you that you then control them.The banks, today, are buying debt that is worthless. But, then maybe, many ofthese banks are not intended to survive.If you take the oligarchy at its word, the Empire says they wish to reduce thepopulation down to 1-2 billion people on this Planet. Which means that hugeportion of the banking system, huge part of national economies, and huge amountsof the population are “destined” to disappear.What is absolutely certain is that we are currently in a process of completeeconomic collapse. Is this disintegration accidental, or the result of poorplanning, or did it happen on purpose? And if so, by whom and why?It’s both. I say there are different groups with different interests. Frencheconomist Jacques Attali, in public interviews, said that the euro was conceivedas a deliberate mechanism to impose political union – with which no one agreed.In other words, there may have been a gross error made by creating the euroduring a crisis to impose a political dictatorship. The same way that we seetoday with the European Stability Mechanism.One intention has been the de-industrialization of Europe and if you look at theEuropean Commission’s policy regarding Spain, for example, you see that theycanceled all programs that have allowed any Spanish recovery, such as cutting25% of the science budget. I think it’s very clear that nobody in the EU intendsfor Spain to recover and, in fact, I think a real goal is the reduction ofpopulation and a return to a type of feudal structure.Please understand, the past never comes back. This is what the bailout really isabout. In trying to save debt, which is in reality, virtual money (it does notexist), the system may be manipulated so that the debt can never be paid. It allbecomes a sham using inflated Monopoly money.By trying to save “the system,” we can destroy ourselves, destroy the socialorder and destroy the nations. And that’s what the bailout really represents.That’s why you see the elite promoting it, because many of these banks will bethrown away anyway. But the nation-states need to go first. Once the nations aregone, then the imperium can reorganize itself, however it wants, and set up anew monetary system.Is there a solution? Of course there is. The solution is to give our economies apurpose, and for each nation on this planet to engender in every person a senseof participation in this great common interest of mankind: to give us all astake in the sustainability of our global system.And, we simply need to take this derivatives garbage, which is credit uponcredit, upon credit – and cancel it. Wipe it out. Eliminate it. Just like that!Derivatives are gambling instruments. And gambling debts, when lost, can becanceled.Therefore, we do not need to pay this gambling debt, whether they are“incentives” or “financial derivatives.” The current system is bankrupt, bothmorally and financially, and to save the world, we need leaders who are preparedto stand up and put the entire financial system into receivership.There is something else you need to understand about the way money works inorder to understand the current financial crisis.Credit System vs. Monetary SystemThe world today is run by monetary systems, not by national credit systems. Youdo not want a monetary system to run the world. You want sovereign nation-statesto have their own credit systems, which is a system of their own currency. Aboveall, you want productive, non-inflationary credit creation by the state, as isfirmly stated in the US Constitution. This sound fisical policy of creditcreation by nation-states has currently been excluded by Maastrich Treaty fromeven being considered as economic and financial stratagem for Europe.A monetary system is a creation of the financial oligarchy that basically treatshumanity like cattle. It is how the elite have operated for centuries.Oligarchies exist by controlling the “coin of the realm,” they control its priceand its availability, thereby controlling the people. They use their moneycontrol to manipulate our world.This is the system of Empire, the system that Alexander Hamilton challenged whenthe United States was created and the U.S. credit system invented. Hamiltonsaid,> > We are not going to ask you for money, we are a sovereign country, we create> > our own money. We will create credit and we will work in the economy in> > order to increase the productivity of our people. We will fund> > infrastructure projects, manufacturing projects, will fund things that> > increase labor productivity and make the economy more productive and> > therefore richer.This is how real wealth is created: the production process. Instead of borrowingmoney from the oligarchs, you create your own money as a sovereign nation anduse it to escape from the clutches of the oligarchy. And this is what allowedthe United States to resist the continuous attempts of the British Empire torecover the US as imperial protectorate. The difference between the monetary andcredit system is the principle on which the current oligarchic system is based.Today, in 2013, in Europe, this non-inflationary credit cannot be produced,because in Europe the governments are subject to control by private bankinginterests, called independent banking systems. These institutions have the powerto regulate government, and to dictate terms to government.Think about how the institution within this European edifice called EuropeanCentral Bank functions. It operates like a European independent central bank,which has no government, because there is no government. There is no nation.It’s a group of nations run by a private bank.Don’t you see? It is insanity. The supposed “independence” of the Central Bankis a decisive control mechanism for private financial interests, which in Europehave historically been installed as an authoritative instrument against aneconomic policy of sovereign governments oriented towards the General Welfare ofits populations. European banking is a remnant of a feudal society, in whichprivate interests – as typified by the ancient Venetian cartels that went intothe shadows in the 14th century.The EndThe worldwide fight we are witnessing today is not for the survival of centralbanks or the euro, but it is a fundamental fight between sovereign governmentsand the oligarchic financial system that benefits a small elite. Any nationwhich cannot control its own currency is not sovereign, and any nation which isnot sovereign is vulnerable to assault and subversion by this oligarchy.Now, if people are to participate in self-government, they must participate inthe ideas by which society is self-governed. This would mean the end ofoligarchies. Nations that foster the creative-mental development of theirpopulation produce a people that will not tolerate oligarchic forms of ruleindefinitely. An illiterate, technologically backward populations will. In fact,there is little doubt that illiteracy and technological backwardness hascontributed to the emergence of oligarchic rule.The ideas of a nation-state republic and progress are joined at the hip.Like many ideas of human creativity, the nation state is not a undertaking to betaken lightly, nor is it designed for immediate desires. It is a long-standinghuman endeavour that has been designed to extend our sense of self far beyondthe confines of our perceptions and feelings of personal well-being. Thenation-states connect us to all the generations, before and after, which strivefor the human legacy of freedom, liberty and pursuit of happiness.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Matt Rodell, Aug. 20, 2009 Nature magazine.2 http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/2012/eirv39n17-20120427/53_3917.pdf.3 Richard Freeman, “The Policy of Controlled Disintegration,” EIR, October 15,1999.4 Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw, “The Commanding Heights: The Battle forthe World Economy,” Free Press, 1997, pp.60-64.5 Will Banyon, “Rockefeller Internationalism,” Nexus, Volume 11, Number 1,December-January 2004.6 Jeremiah Novak, Atlantic Monthly, July 1977.7 “The policy of controlled disintegration,” Richard Freeman, EIR Volume 26,number 41, October 15, 1999.8 Ibid. 9 “A History of Rigged & Fraudulent Oil Prices (and What It Can Teach Us aboutGold & Silver,” Mr. Lars Schall interview with F.

Created in 1994 out of the GATT UruguayRound, the WTO introduced a radical new international agreement, Trade-RelatedAspects of Intellectual Property Rights” (TRIPS), which permitted multinationalsto patent plant and other life forms for the first time.The WTO was created after World War II by internationalist in Washington toserve “as a wedge to push free trade among major industrial nations, especiallythe European Community.”2 It was given birth out of wedlock on January 1, 1995when the Marrakech Agreement replaced GATT, which had commenced in 1948.According to their own publicity, the World Trade Organization establishes aframework for creating non-discriminating, reciprocal trade policies. Thereality appears quite different. The WTO’s anti-nation-state intent can bereadily seen in their 1988 slogan: “One World, One Market.” That slogan camefrom the GATT Montreal summit of its predecessor, Uruguay Round of Agriculture“Reform” (1986-94) – the process in which WTO was birthed.A watershed moment came in 1993 when the European Union agreed to a majorreduction of their national agriculture protection.This reduction was a multi-stage process. First step, according to the incomingWTO game rules, the members nations were to be forced to open their borders, togrant the right to operate freely within those borders to other nations, and toeliminate national grain reserves.Grain reserves were no longer to be the dominion of independent nation-states.They became property, to be managed by the “free market,” by private, mostlyAmerican mega-corporations, in other words, corporations running the worldmarkets.These companies were already dominant, but now, “they had a new unelectedsupranational body to advance its private agenda on a global scale. WTO became apoliceman for global free trade and a (predatory) battering ram”3 with an annualbudget worth trillions of dollar. “Its rules are written with teeth for punitiveleverage to levy heavy financial and other penalties on rule violators.”4 Underthis regimen, agriculture control is a priority.What’s more, the rules, which were sold as the beacon of hope for underdevelopedcountries, were written by the corporate giants that form the nucleus of WorldCompany Inc. The blueprint for “market-oriented” agricultural reform was writtenby D. Gale Johnson of the University of Chicago for David Rockefeller’sTrilateral Commission, and former Cargill executive Dan Amstutz played aprominent role in drafting the agriculture rules of the GATT Uruguay Round.Cargill is the world’s largest grain company.New draconian rules have been forced upon a free and integrated global market tocontrol its products. The new agreements have also banned agricultural exportcontrols, even in times of famine. Today, the cartels domination over the worldexport grain trade has grown even greater.Further, this international pact forbids countries from restricting tradethrough food safety laws called trade barriers. This stratagem has also openedthe world markets to unrestricted GMO food imports with no need to prove theirsafety, but more on that, later.Agriculture is food, and food is what we eat. We too often take it for granted –especially in the first world – that we will always have an abundance of food. Atrip to the supermarket, and our needs are taken care of. What happens if oneday soon, you wake up, and there is nothing to eat? Then what?WTO propaganda tells us that the world “market” and so-called “free-trade” willsomehow provide the favorable conditions necessary for growth. However, with thecreation of multi-nation trading zones, citizen-responsive governments losepower and control at the expense of these supra-national agencies that supersedethe authority of nation-states. These agencies do not in any way represent thepeople of any one nation. Instead, their loyalties lie with the corporations andfinancial organisms that elect them, fund them and support them. Theseorganizations form one of the nodes of elite rule, a top down imperiousstructure that seeks to enslave populations through many guises, includingsubtle pschyological warfare and other soft-war techniques.Agreements such as GATT and NAFTA have subtly destroyed national economies byputting them under the imperatives of world commerce and globalization withoutborders. Globalization is a top down concept, which means that the farmers – thepeople, who actually put the food on our table – are wiped out and replaced bygiant multi-faceted corporations, which strive to control the production anddistribution of food.> > During the last two decades, millions of farmers in the United States,> > Europe, Canada, Australia, and Argentina have been wiped out. For example,> > in 1982, the United States still had 600,000 independent hog farmers. Today,> > that number is less than 225,000.5Make sure you understand – this is no accident – fewer independent farmers meangreater corporate control over what you eat. People can pretty much get used toanything in life, except not having enough to eat. Even death is easier. Youonly have to suffer it once.GATT, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Central America Free TradeAgreement (CAFTA) and every such binding agreement has helped spawn ghettos andshanty towns in cities throughout Latin America, Asia and Africa by creatingconditions that force people off their land, while elite take over the means ofproduction. Shanty towns and ghost towns equal depopulation on the one hand. Onthe other, if you can force people off their land and into the cities, you arecreating a perfect storm of discontent amongst the masses. Mass unrest requiresarmed forces control – problem, reaction, solution.This is exactly the prediction of UK’s Ministry of Defense Strategic Trendsreport, which, as we have said, was based on a 2005 Bilderberg blueprint. In2013, over 50% of the world’s population is living in urban rather than ruralenvironments. The report states:> > There will be a substantial growth in shanty towns and unplanned, random> > urban settlement, increasing the resource cost and environmental impact.6With the destruction of nation-state republics and the creation of mega-economicblocks, which are linked to each other through a globalized marketplace,independent countries can be “replaced by Mega-Cities” with population bases ofover 20 million people.Caused by a massive population displacement, these cities will swell tounimaginable proportions “which will already have experienced endemiclawlessness and high levels of violence.”One of the first experiments to bring about the depopulation of large cities wasconducted in Cambodia by the Pol Pot regime. It is interesting to note that amodel for Pol Pot’s genocidal plan was drawn up in the United States by one ofthe Club of Rome’s supported research foundations, and overseen by ThomasEnders, a high-ranking State Department official.The Club of Rome, founded in 1968, is made up of some of the oldest members ofVenetian Black Nobility. The Club is the most important institution in the worldto push the Malthusian depopulation scheme. A report by the Club of Rome leaveslittle room for doubt as to their real agenda:> > In search for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that> > pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the> > like would fit the bill.They concluded with the following:> > The real enemy, then, is humanity itself.Thus, a leading international institutions is pushing policies of retrogressionin technology, and reduction of the world’s population by several billion people– that’s genocide, in case you didn’t know it.And there is no better or cheaper way to reduce population than throughstarvation. And in order to starve a people to death, you must take control oftheir food production away from independent farmers, and put it into the handsof giant corporations subservient to the interests of World Company Inc. – somerefreshing food for thought the next time you have your breakfast cereal.Within the WTO regulations, nations are prohibited from protecting local economyor tax goods, even when these goods clearly were produced with slave labor.Furthermore, nations are not allowed to give preference to local economies thathire local people at decent wages to produce goods that then benefited the localbusiness and economy – people who paid taxes, played by the rules and reinvestedtheir hard earned wealth into the local or national market.The truth is: “free trade is rigged trade, and the ‘fairness’ question isdiversionary propaganda for deluded lawmakers, farmers, and the public. It isrun by an international financial cartel. The cartel interests control theplaying field: who plays and the rules of the game.”7When you expand the cartel’s control into strategic areas such as food, thesituation gets serious in a hurry.Food as WeaponThe result of the imposition of WTO rules, internationally, over the past 15years has been that food processing and trade have come to be monopolized to anextreme degree by a small tight clique of cartel companies. These firms dominateinternational commodity flows, and even the domestic food supplies anddistribution of most nations.The use of food as a weapon is an ancient practice and can be found at leastfour thousand years ago in Mesopotamia. In ancient Greece, the cults of Apollo,Demeter and others often controlled the shipment of grain and other foodstuffsthrough a temple system.Imperial Rome, Venice, the powerful Burgundian duchy, the Dutch and BritishLevant companies, the East India companies, and West India companies – allfollowed suit. Today, food warfare is firmly under the control of just a fewcorporations.The largest food company in the world is Nestlé. It was founded in 1867, and isbased in Switzerland. It is the number-one world trader in whole milk powder andcondensed milk; the number-one seller of chocolate, confectionery products, andmineral water (it owns Perrier); and the number-three U.S.-based coffee firm. Italso owns 26% of the world’s biggest cosmetic company, L’Oreal.Much of the rest of the milk powder business is controlled by theAnglo-Dutch-owned Unilever, the result of a 1930 merger of a British and a Dutchfirm. Unilever is the number-one world producer of ice cream and margarine, aswell as a key player in fats and edible oils. Unilever owns vast plantations andruns Africa’s largest trading company, United Africa Co. In Zimbabwe,Congo-Zaire, Mali, Chad and Sudan, the United Africa Co. is projected by theBritish intelligence as ushering in a “United States of Africa.”“The boundaries among states are to be dissolved, and their contents organizedas a new business franchise with two purposes: first, the security of foreigninvestment and seizure of property titles on raw materials by primarily BritishCommonwealth mining and other companies;”8 and second, the lining of the pocketsof the government enforcers of the policy.These policy enforcers already primarily agree with the ideology of zero growth– the idyllic primitive life of “useless eaters,” as Henry Kissinger has calledanyone living below the Tropic of Cancer. “Not only in Africa, but Third Worldpeasant populations will be organized to do what has come ‘naturally’ for years-- apply their quaint picks and hoes to land wasted by centuries of laborintensive farming to scrape together tribute to the World Bank in the form offood. The result will be a net decline in food production and consumptionworldwide.”9But, it gets worse, much worse.Minnesota-based Cargill Company is the world’s largest grain company. Grainconstitutes a dominant portion of the standard diet. Since the 1920s, thebillionaire MacMillan family have run Cargill. The MacMillans are members of theBilderberg Group.John Hugh MacMillan, president and chairman of Cargill from 1936 through 1960,held the title of hereditary Knight Commander of Justice in the Sovereign Orderof St. John (Knights of Malta), one of the Vatican’s most important orders.> > Cargill’s international trading arm, Tradax, Inc., is headquartered in> > Geneva, Switzerland.

By far the biggest and the dirtiest of themall is Monsanto, with an international workforce of 21,035, in 404 facilities in66 countries. Monsanto has power that supersedes the influence of mostgovernments on the planet. An associate of Monsanto, Dr. Roger Beachey, wasappointed by President Brack Obama in 2010, as the Science Advisor to theAgriculture Department.

It is a virtual spider web offinancial, political, economic and industry interests with the Venetianultramontane fondi model at the center. These people own and manage the affairsof an interlocking corporate apparatus that dominates choke points within theglobal economy, especially finance, insurance, raw materials, transportation,and consumer goods.Cargill, the largest privately held agribusiness corporation, along with ArcherDaniels Midland have became the arbiters of death. The question is: Why are megacorporations and a small socio-political elite allowed to own our food – tocontrol the very basis of human survival?How it Works> > The control works as follows: The oligarchy has developed four regions to be> > the principal exporters of almost every type of food, in the process> > acquiring top-down control over the food chain in these regions.

Not if they are members of World TradeOrganization. If any country tries to protect its local markets, then the entireworld community is entitled to rebel against the “protectionist policies.”As economist William Engdahl writes in The Seeds of Destruction:> > The WTO rules assert that nations must eliminate food reserves, eliminate> > tariffs on food imports and exports, cease intervening to support their> > domestic farm sector – all under the imperial rationalization that such> > nation-serving measures would be ‘trade-distorting’ practices, which would> > impede the free-market ‘rights’ of the globalist corporations.

And the devaluation of currency isdirectly related to our purchasing power. This became part of the scheme underNixon’s New Economic Plan (NEP) that included closing the gold window in 1971and the invalidation of the Bretton Woods agreement.Under Bretton Woods, at the close of World War II, a gold reserve standard wasestablished, with the U.S. dollar pegged to gold at $35 an ounce. Bretton Woodscompletely eliminated the risk of dramatic currency losses as a result ofspeculative runs on national currencies.Once the federal gold window was closed and the Bretton Woods agreementscrapped, currencies were allowed to float freely. Developing nations becametargets, because the corporate elite and the World Company Incorporated couldnot allow these nations to attain food-sufficiency in grains and beef.Instead, by forcing them to rely on America for key commodities, and with thedollar value manipulated at will, Third World nations were forced to concentrateon small fruits, sugar and vegetables for export. Then with that earned foreignexchange they could then purchase some of their needed goods plus pay IMF andWorld Bank loans for the rest, creating a never-ending cycle of debt slavery.Today, nothing has changed, except that the currency debasement used against theThird World forty years ago is now being actively and openly used against thehelpless populations in America and Europe. For example, a small county of100,000 people in the United States between the years 2003 and 2008 lost over$3.3 billion of purchasing power. Again, please understand, to debase acurrency, is to reduce its value and purchasing power.Money does effect peoples’ lives. The United Nations has estimated that the 2007banking crisis drove 100 million people back into poverty around the world. Themortality statistics and morbidity statistics – the number of extra people whodie and are ill – rise dramatically when a population lives in poverty. PaulMoore, former head of risk for the Halifax Bank of Scotland stated:> > He would be very surprised if the financial crisis didn’t kill more people> > than any single conflict since WWII.16Please never forget that any government that allows its internal market to turninto a free-trade market for the world in food, in the name of the deceptive“economic efficiency,” is consciously deterimined to kill its own population.This policy serves to directly undercut the purpose of a government to promotethe general welfare of it’s citizens, and it furthers the intent of thecorporate imperial system, to drastically reduce world agro-industrial potentialand create conditions for depopulation. Under the “markets” principle, the“global sourcing” of food by corporate monopolies, works to the detriment of thepopulations in both the exporting and importing nations.It may seem difficult to understand, but it is easy to explain.As I said in the first chapter, there are currently seven billion people onPlanet Earth, a small planet with limited natural resources and an everexpanding population base. Food and water are becoming ever scarcer. For theelite to eat, you and I have to die.Needless to say, the policies and programs that push the depopulation issues areworked out at a supranational level. Behind the scenes and away from publicspotlight, private and very secretive organizations such as the TrilateralCommission, Council on Foreign Relations and the Bilderberg Group take care ofbusiness, making sure nation-states abide the free-trade line.Trilateral CommissionWithout a doubt, the Bilderberg Group is the premier secret forum operating inthe shadows of power, but the Trilateral Commission also plays a vital role inthe One World Incorporated’s scheme to use wealth, concentrated in the hands ofa few, to exert world control. And as I have said before, there is no better wayto control an ever growing population than through the only resource peoplecannot do without – food.The Trilateral Commission, with easily recognizable members, was founded in 1973at a meeting attended by 300 influential, handpicked Rockefeller friends fromNorth America, Europe and Japan.Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, George H.W. Bush, Paul Volcker(Carter’s Federal Reserve Chairman) and Alan Greenspan answered DavidRockefeller’s call for creating a:> > … community of a developed nations, which can effectively address itself to> > the larger concerns confronting mankind.17The organization “laid the basis for a new global strategy for a network ofinterlinked international elites,” many of whom were Rockefeller businesspartners. Combined, their financial, economic and political clout was unmatched.So was their ambition.From William Engdahl’s Seeds of Destruction:> > Trilateralists laid the foundation for today’s globalization.

Another pillar had a name, it was called the Green Revolution.Post WWIIFranklin Delano Roosevelt died. Harry Truman became President. The War ended.Japan capitulated under the weight of the horrors of an atomic explosion. TheSoviet Union became a superpower. Winston Churchill made his famous speech. TheIron Curtain went up, and the world became bipolar. The Cold War was upon us.Food became a weapon – through stealth.During the Cold War, food was a strategic weapon. Masquerading as “Food forPeace,” it became a cover for US agriculture to engineer the transformation offamily farming into global agribusiness.

Nobody at the time realized that corners are never round, but that’sbeside the point.Green RevolutionThe Green Revolution, in a publicity campaign touted by the mainstream media,was purported to have saved over a billion people from starvation in Mexico,Latin America, India and other select countries, and with its free marketefficiency during the 1950s and the 1960s, the “revolution” increasedagriculture production around the world. According to the propaganda:> > … it involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal,> > expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management> > techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and> > pesticides to farmers.19In reality, as it emerged years later, the Green Revolution was a brilliantRockefeller family scheme to develop a globalized agribusiness, which they thencould monopolize just as they had done in the world’s oil industry beginning ahalf century before. It was called agribusiness, in order to differentiate itfrom traditional farmer-based agriculture – the cultivation of crops for humansustenance and nutrition.> > It gave US chemical giants and major grain traders new markets for their> > products.

These same cartelsclaim patent rights to seeds and crop traits. The same cartels also controlaccess to the technologies that manipulates the genetic characteristics, andwith full Washington and WTO backing, they are playing God and patenting life.These are the same cartels that also control the production and distribution ofwhat we eat, as well as the shipping routes that deliver the food to us.But it does not end there.The control of food supplies is a matter of national security. The U.S.Department of Agriculture is one of the key elements in a national securityedifice attempting to control the world food market.Genetically Modified OrganismsOn a personal level, I first became aware of the elite’s focus on agricultureafter I began looking into genetically modified crops. I soon became interestedin how the global agricultural markets worked. The more I researched, the more Irealized that one of the elite’s best weapons being promoted in the corporatemedia was genetically modified seeds – seeds with a genetically engineered DNAand modified through the introduction of foreign bacteria resistant genes,creating new species of seed corn, soybean, and so on.This was being presented as the solution to world hunger, but to me, none of itmade much sense. I wondered where the whole idea of genetically modified cropcame from. And lo and behold, I came across a well-known name, an entity thatwas known for their efforts to control oil and global power: the Rockefellerfamily and the Rockefeller Foundation.In fact, there are three or four giant agribusiness and agrochemical groupings,rooted in the chemical industry, which have virtually monopolized the market andhave established a cartel around genetically modified seeds.And I soon also realized that it was a political issue. The more I delved themore I investigated, the more diabolical the plans for genetic manipulationseemed to me. In fact, what I discovered was that these plans were directlyrelated to the involvement of the Rockefellers in what is called eugenics, theracist policy also used by Hitler and the Nazis in the Third Reich.But, what few people talk about, is that many of the Nazi’s eugenics’ programswere funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. The affiliation between genetics andeugenics has remained intact from then until now, with on-going corporateinvolvement.Monsanto is one of these companies, and like Haliburton or Exxon Mobile orBoeing, which are considered national security assets, they take advantage ofthe resources of the U.S. state and international institutions to increase theirpower over the global economy.The Rockefellers funded the early research that created the transgenic productsthrough the introduction of foreign bacteria into specific strains of corn orsoybeans. But the only strain marketed, so far, on a large scale has been theseed resistant to Monsanto’s Roundup. Roundup, Monsanto’s glyphosate-basedherbicide, has become the world’s best selling weed-killer.Monsanto’s GM seeds are the only seed strains that resist the toxins that aresprayed on crop and kill everything around them. The corn stalks resistant totoxins give the impression of strength and vitality. All of this is a part of aRockefellers’ wet dream – they start with seeds and plants, but ultimate theymanipulate human genes.One of their plans deals with financing a project to develop a type of maize, akey staple in Latin America, which contains an element that causes the humansperm not to be able to conceive children. If this is not a eugenic plan forpopulation reduction, I do not know what is. The project is supported and fundedby the U.S. government through the Department of Agriculture.Henry KissingerIn the early 1970s, Nixon, busy with the Watergate affair, had little time forthe business of the presidency. The acting Commander-in-Chief, according tosome, was Henry Kissinger, who in April 1974 issued National Security StudyMemorandum 200. This was a top-secret report on national security, which statedthat the reduction or control of populations was a prerequisite for the UnitedStates to provide food aid and other assistance to foreign countries.The aim was to adopt a plan for drastic global population control – that is, toreduce it to three billion people by the year 2050.Genetically Modified FoodGM foods today saturate our diet. In all supermarkets in the developed world,one finds Nestlé products, Monsanto, Unilever and all major brands. All of thesecompanies promote and sell GM foods because it appears that 70% or more of theproducts that Americans consume contain Monsanto’s or other company’s GMproducts.Everything from potatoes, tomatoes, and corn to rice and wheat; legumes likesoybeans; vegetable oils; soft drinks; salad dressings; infant formula;vegetables and fruits; dairy products including eggs; meat and many other animalproducts that we buy in the supermarket have been genetically modified.It is a form of control: it ruins local farmers in countries like Argentina andBrazil and replaces them with foreign-owned, giant industrial complexes. Farmersare driven from their land and forced to subsist in the cities, living in slums,constituting cheap labor for global industry manufacturing concerns.> > Food inspection authorities and biologists experimenting with the> > manipulation of DNA structures for large food companies claim that these> > products have undergone sufficient testing and form no danger to public> > health.22However, this is a blatant lie. For example, the world’s leading plant lectinsand plant genetic modification expert, Arpad Pusztai discovered that:> > … rats fed GMO potatoes had smaller livers, hearts, testicles and brains,> > damaged immune systems, and showed structural changes in their white blood> > cells making them more vulnerable to infection and disease compared to other> > rats fed non-GMO potatoes. It got worse. Thymus and spleen damage showed up;> > enlarged tissues, including the pancreas and intestines; and there were> > cases of liver atrophy as well as significant proliferation of stomach and> > intestines cells that could be a sign of greater future risk of cancer.> > Equally alarming – this all happened after ten days of testing, and the> > changes persisted after 110 days that’s the human equivalent of ten years.23Furthermore eating genetically modified corn and consuming trace levels ofMonsanto’s Roundup chemical fertilizer caused rats to developed an extraordinarynumber of tumors, widespread organ damage, and premature death, according toresearch,24 carried out by Caen University in France,25 which looked at thelong-term effects of consuming Monsanto’s genetically modified corn. Theresearch is described as “the most thorough research ever published into thehealth effects of GM food crops and the herbicide Roundup on rats.”> > Despite the enormous risks, however, Washington and growing numbers of> > governments around the world in parts of Europe, Asia, Latin America and> > Africa now allow these products to be grown in their soil or imported.> > They’re produced and sold to consumers because agribusiness giants like> > Monsanto, DuPont, Dow AgriSciences and Cargill have enormous clout to demand> > it and a potent partner supporting them – the US government and its> > agencies, including the Departments of Agriculture and State, FDA, EPA and> > even the defense establishment.26A Common DenominatorDo you know what Agent Orange, saccharin, bovine growth hormone, GM soybeans andthe first nuclear weapons, all have in common? They were created or distributedby Monsanto. Monsanto’s first product was saccharin, it was later proved to be acarcinogen. Furthermore, these US GMO giants also have a long sordid associationwith the Pentagon in supplying massively destructive chemicals like the AgentOrange and napalm used to defoliate Vietnam jungles in the 1960s and 1970s,thereby exposing hundreds of thousands of civilians and US troops to deadlydioxin – one of the most toxic of all known compounds.Stop and think for a moment. Monsanto, Cargill, DuPont & Co. want us to trustthem with the most important things we ingest – our food.Food is power. And when it is used to cull the population, it becomes a weaponof mass destruction. You may not realize it, but the Rockefellers and theirfriends certainly do.Today, the entire population is being used as lab rats in an uncontrolled,unregulated mass human experiment for these completely new, untested andpotentially hazardous products.> > Food safety and public health issues aren’t considered vital if they> > conflict with profits. And leading the effort to develop them is a company> > with a long record of fraud, cover-up, bribery, deceit and disdain for the> > public interest – Monsanto.27But there is an even darker side to the Monsanto GMOs – a depopulation agenda.As in reducing the world’s population through what we eat. Surprised?One of the largest organizations working behind the scenes on depopulationagenda is the Rockefeller Foundation. In 2001, a privately owned biotechcompany, Epicyte, financed by the Foundation announced it successfully developedthe “ultimate GMO crop” – contraceptive corn. It was called a solution to worldover-population.In a late development, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has put intoeffect new policies that allow genetic engineering companies, predominantly the“Big Agro” corporations, to put on the market any Genetically Modified Organismsthey wish without consulting the public. When you think about this, it’s notjust a GMO grass that takes less water, or GMO tomatoes that last much longer onthe shelf. Genetic engineers say that in different studies, GMO potatoes, rice,etc., there could be side effects such as the reducing fertility in second andthird generations.Reduced fertility … eugenics … depopulation.Along with the public traits these organisms are being engineered for, there areother traits quietly being built in, to cause biological changes in the body. Inone groundbreaking study conducted by Andres Carrasco, the head of the molecularEmbryology Lab at the University of Buenos Aires, and chief scientist at theNational Council for Science and Technology, found that pesticides used in cropsmay be an endocrine disruptor.> > The ingredient glyphosate, which is used in Roundup herbicide, is increasing> > the number of birth defects in animals.

Inthe fifties, the Harvard business school developed a product called the“agro-industrial project.” Ray Goldberg was a professor of the Faculty ofBusiness, and John Davis was advisor to the Department of Agriculture. Davis andGoldberg theorized on a cartel structure for agriculture, based on the system bywhich the oil majors monopolistically controlled world oil market.Not surprisingly, the idea came from the Rockefellers. It was a project thatmoved forward step by step, starting with orange juice produced in Florida.Florida orange producers soon became the weakest link in the chain rather thanbeing the most important. Because with the agro-industrial system, everythingwas based on efficiency and maximum profitability for the cartel that dominatedthe top of the pyramid. This system has been perfected through globalization.Today, there are roughly twenty to thirty mega-business groups, of which fourare concerned with GMOs, such as Monsanto and Bayer, the aspirin producer inGermany. But all of them act as a cartel that tries to monopolize all theagro-essential seeds in the world. They will buy independent seed companies,whether they produce good or bad seeds, simply to monopolize the market.However, the control of the seeds by the agro-industry is but one aspect of theelite’s diabolical plan to control us and our world. As is the case with thefinancial meltdown, orchestrated from behind the scenes by the elite, the recordrise in grain and food prices is an integral part of a long-term strategy by theRockefeller brothers in organizing the global food chain along the same monopolymodel they had used in oil and medicine.30 How was it done?De-Regulation and SpeculationIn 2007, everything came to a screeching halt, the financial bubble exploded andspeculators began losing money by the billions. The Wall Street beast needed tobe fed, and speculators and pundits clamored for greater and freer trade tooffset the financial meltdown. The Ponzi schemers, the speculators and thespecial interest groups pushed for fully-deregulated markets. Everything was tobecome fair game. The world was up for sale. The US government’s push to fullyderegulate wheat exports betrayed the nation’s wheat farmers to the predatoryglobal grain cartel and commodity speculators.Deregulating grain speculation and creating favorable conditions for uncheckedmarket manipulations by eliminating agricultural commodity derivativesregulation became the game in town – a new game with boundless possibilities.> > The historic and unprecedented deregulation opened a massive hole in> > Government supervision of derivatives trading, a gaping hole that ultimately> > facilitated the derivatives games leading to the 2007 US sub-prime financial> > collapse.> > Of course, deregulation by government merely opened the door to private> > control – another form of regulation – by the largest and most powerful> > corporate groups in any given industry.

By the latter part of 2007, trading in food derivatives was fully> > deregulated by Washington, and US government grain reserves gone. The way> > was clear for dramatic food price rises.31Back in 1991, Goldman Sachs came up with its own commodity index, a derivativethat tracked all commodities from metals to energy and from oil to food, soy andwheat. Wall Street greed took over and with it, the ability to manipulate theprice of essential foods worldwide at will.The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index reduced food to a mathematical formula.Barclays, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, AIG, Bear Stearns, and LehmanBrothers, speculators, high-risk offshore hedge funds bet on the future grainprice with no need to take delivery of actual wheat or corn at the end of thecontract. Food was no longer a physical “good” to feed the world, but rather avirtual and unlimited trading instrument. The corporate empires expanded asnever before, making them rich beyond their wildest dreams. Grain was nowentirely decoupled from everyday supply and demand – sending shock wavesthroughout the world.The Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN estimates that since 2004, worldfood prices on average have soared by an unprecedented 240%, sending price-shockwaves throughout the global food production and delivery system.The market was no longer run by people involved in the food business, but by thenew casino masters of grain supplies – from Wall Street to London and beyond.The dotcom bubble followed the real estate bubble and we may see a food bubble.Hundreds of millions have already starved to death, mostly in the third world.They were the greatest of the unwashed, the useless eaters, dirty, diseased,bare-bellied African, Asians and South Americans – a blip on the mainstreamcorporate networks’ map. An unimportant statistics for most, but watched by themost astute movers and shakers of the imperium. To them, that billion-strongarmy of the walking dead was a key indicator that their master plan of worlddepopulation was right on schedule.Food has “become just another commodity like oil or tin or silver whose scarcityand price can ultimately be controlled by a small group of powerful tradinginsiders.”32There is an intricate link between the people who control food and the peoplewho control medicine. It is another aspect of the elite’s control of thepopulation.Rockefeller Global Medical CartelAround 1908, the Rockefeller family decided they could make money in theemerging pharmaceutical industry. But, why stop there? Why not turn the practiceof medicine, as a whole in the United States, into pharmaceutical medicine basedon the petrochemical industry. It seemed logical, as the Rockefellers werealready in the oil business.The family commissioned a study called the Flexner Report, whose findingsdestroyed all traditional forms of medicine that was practiced at that time inthe United States.The study claimed that traditional forms of medicine were worthless and notscientific. It was a commercial attack against all forms of traditionalmedicine, and looked to replace them with the Rockefeller pharmaceutical(allopathic) medicine. It was a fully-fledged takeover of the medical system.Over the years, it has grown to the current point in which under the newnational health care law, the government has launched a surreptitious program tomap out all treatments and all diagnoses allowed for all diseases and disorders.If you’re a part of the national health system, you could be forced to gothrough certain procedures.The authorities will make a diagnosis, and you have to take the appropriatemedicine. If you reject or do not agree to take the prescribed medicine, theycan put small transmitters in pills to see that you take them. This is what onefuture looks like – A Brave New World. We will find ourselves locked into ahealth-care system, inaugurated by the Rockefellers in the United States andspread worldwide, which allows only one type of medical practice?Cradle-to-Grave MentalityThe drug cartel consists of a group of institutions and organizations, somestate-run, some not, which is trying to impose a system of cradle-to-the-gravemedical-care on all of mankind. It may sound good, but what it really means isthat we can be forced throughout our lives to take toxic and destructive drugs.The effect of these drugs may severely weaken the population, just as it appearsis happening in America, today.Even unborn children in the industrialized world are now considered and labeledas medical patients, and are included in the health system from birth. Thehighly toxic Hepatitis B vaccine is currently given to all children in theUnited States before they leave the hospital after birth, unless parentsexplicitly reject it.Direct evidence shows that the US health care system kills 225,000 people peryear, of which 106,000 died because of drugs approved by the FDA. This meansthat in one decade, 2.25 million people died due to the shortcomings in UShealth care, as stated in a July 26, 2000 Journal of the American MedicalAssociation study called, “Is U.S. health really the best in the world?” Thearticle was written by Dr. Barbara Starfield who was working at the academy forpublic health at Johns Hopkins.In other words, because the FDA approves toxic drugs, then they are complicitand responsible before and after the events. Sadly it seems that FDA is not anorganization whose task is to protect the patient. Pharmaceutical companies, itappears, are FDA’s clients. Why would the FDA approve dangerous drugs? Becausethe best customers of the FDA are the drug companies. But ultimately, it comesdown to that same kind of callous indifference to human life as practiced by theThird Reich.The overall objective of the pharmaceutical drug cartel is population control.In other words, undermine the ability of people to think, to feel, to have lifeexperiences, to understand what is being done and who does it. This is theperfect system if you are planning to control the world. Cradle-to-grave healthcare with toxic drugs that destroy you as people.The goal of globalization is a global management system. Politically speaking,this is what some call the “new world order.” The dilemma is how do you sellsuch evil to sane, articulate, intelligent, attentive and independent people?You don’t.What is needed is people that are as weak as humanly possible, and it turns outthat a most effective way to achieve this is by massive drugging of thepopulation. This is being done through pharmaceutical medicine. This is exactlywhat is happening worldwide, and there are statistics to prove it.If we add to the death toll the number of people who are affected or sufferingfrom serious adverse reactions to certain drugs, we are talking about betweenthirty and forty million people. These people cannot think, cannot functionindependently, and they can be easily convinced to follow orders. This is thebottom line of the operation.AfricaIn the mid-seventies, the World Health Organization, which is a part of the UNapparatus, announced that it had eliminated smallpox in Africa. It was anoccasions to celebrate with champagne, the greatest medical victory in thehistory of mankind. Then, almost ten years later, investigative journalist JonRappoport obtained exclusive information from an absolutely reliable source,about a secret meeting in Geneva, which came shortly after the WHO announcedtheir victory. At this meeting it was decided, that the smallpox vaccine wouldbe shelved and never used again.Why? Because this highly dangerous vaccine itself was causing smallpox. In fact,this has been an open secret for decades. Doctors know, researchers know, RobertGallo from the National Cancer Institute knew. Gallo was the one who said thatif given a vaccine, like smallpox, to populations whose immune system had beensuppressed, you risk killing huge numbers of people. That’s exactly whathappened. Thus, the World Health Organization had no choice but to shelve thisvaccine.But we are still left with an obvious question: What about WHO’s claim thatsmallpox had been eradicated in Africa? True, the visible signs of smallpox suchas skin lesions were no longer visible on the millions of people who were giventhe smallpox vaccine. But then people began to develop diseases unknown at thatpoint in the Third World.Soon after, people in Africa were dying by the tens of thousands. Cases ofmeningitis became common. To avoid worldwide indignation and a scandal, the WHOand the United Nations simply changed the diagnosis, making it possible for themto claim victory in their fight against smallpox. People with smallpox were nowbeing diagnosed with AIDS. This was a cover up of a gigantic crime perpetratedby the World Health Organization in the Third World and particularly in Africa.Order out of ChaosWe are witnessing “controlled chaos.” The elite are afraid of uncontrolledoutwardly manifestations of violence from the people – unless the violenceitself is managed by the elite. The type of chaos they are looking for occurs inthe human body. In other words, it is the chaos of being poisoned. If youintroduce harmful, toxic drugs into your body throughout your life, your bodywill begin to breakdown at some point. Chaos. The chaos of being intoxicated –literally poisoned. But, in this case, the poisoning will be internal, and tosome extent controlled by drugs such as sedatives or tranquilizers.We see millions or perhaps even billions of people, everyday, who are nothingmore than the shell of what they once were. They’re walking dead – they aresubmissive and obedient.Please understand, world government and the medical cartel go hand in hand. Theyare the same thing because at the highest levels of power, the elite know thatthe final goal of the pharmaceutical cartel is to destroy, weaken and shortenhuman life.As I have noted before, the globalists want weak willed populations. If you arethe elite, how do you get there? The pharmaceutical industry.This is a hidden part of the operation. We have to ask yourselves: What are thekey weapons of the global state? How do they control the minds, bodies andpeople? Again, please understand that the global police state and the medicalcartel work together towards the same final objective – total enslavement of thepeople.There is another aspect of this secret agenda we need to look at.Codex Alimentarius – Depopulation by StealthCreated by the UN in 1961, with the mandate of guarding the health of consumers,Codex Alimentarius (Latin for food code) is an industry dominated regulationauthority as well as an UN-sponsored organization, which – under the auspices ofthe World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization(FAO) – established global trade standards for foods. In principle, it has nolegal standing but the Codex has risen to the level of de facto legal standingbecause Codex Alimentarius is administered by the WHO and FAO.In 1994, the World Trade Organization (WTO) replaced the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT) and was given the trade-sanction power to enforce theCodex, and other standards and guidelines, as a means of harmonizing foodstandards globally for easy trade between countries. In other words, once Codexguidelines, rules and regulations become ratified and approved, they becomemandatory for any member-country of the WHO.International organizations, which are concerned for our well-being and worriedabout the nutrition and diet of humanity sounds great in theory. Except thatCodex has little to do with saving lives and has all to do with the elites’plans to depopulate the planet.The recently approved German Plan of Codex states that no vitamin, herb, ormineral can be sold for preventive or therapeutic purposes.> > Potency levels of supplements would be severely limited. All supplements> > sold to or in member nations of the Codex would have to be approved> > according to these draconian guidelines.33Why is this being done? Because nutrients make people smarter, stronger, andmore free and independent.Please understand that Codex is the enemy of everyone except those who willprofit from it. Plus there is a hands-on, direct association with those whocommitted horrendous crimes against humanity during the Nazi regime:> > One of those found guilty was the president of the megalithic corporation> > I.G.

It has always been about money> > and profits at the expense of people.36Please understand Codex is a weapon being used to reduce the level of nutritionworldwide. For example, “Codex does not set limits for most of the dangerousindustrial chemicals that can be used in food. In 2001, 176 countries includingthe U.S. got together and decided that twelve highly toxic organic chemicals,out of which nine are pesticides, known as persistent organic pollutants (POPS)were so bad that they had to be banned.> > Under Codex, seven of the nine forbidden POPS will again be allowed in the> > production of food.

The war being waged worldwide today and tomorrow isnot against terror but rather against these pesky creatures known as humans.According to the projections of the WHO and the FAO, a minimum of 3 billionpeople will die from the Codex mandated vitamin and mineral guideline alone.> > Under Codex, every dairy animal can be treated with growth hormone, and all> > animals in the food chain will be treated with sub-clinical levels of> > antibiotics.

The DNA isa code for life, the twisting strands that hold the genes of every living thingon Earth, essentially comes down to four basic molecules, a long polymer ofsugars, linked together by a phosphate – adenine, cytosine, guanine and thymine,better known by their first letters A, C, G and T. It’s the order of these thatconveys genetic information.And because these molecules are well understood, they can be manufacturedsynthetically and rearranged to design brand new genes.> > The phosphate can be modified with a sulfur atom replacing oxygen and the> > resulting molecule can still undergo base pairing with normal nucleic acids.> > These synthetic molecules can actually be used by the normal cellular> > machinery if they’re supplied to bacteria, creating an expanded genetic> > code.40Now, in one of the biggest breakthroughs in recent history, scientists havecreated a synthetic genome that can self-replicate. They have taken a cell andmodified the genes of a cell by inserting DNA from another organism. And thebacteria replicated itself, thus creating a second generation of the syntheticDNA.> > The cell is totally derived from a synthetic chromosome, made with four> > bottles of chemicals on a chemical synthesizer, starting with information in> > a computer.41The organism will do exactly what the scientist intended: a living thing, butunder the control of Man.> > If the 19th Century was all about the revolution of harnessing energy from> > fossil fuels, and the 20th Century was about exploiting the power of data,> > this century will be about controlling biology.42What is amazing about this, is that the cell was assembled and sparked into lifein a laboratory. This technology has taken mankind across a threshold. A turningpoint that marked a coming of age of a new science called, synthetic biology,founded on the ambition that one day it will be possible to design andmanufacture a human being.In other words, you can get a DNA of anything here on Earth and create organismsthat never before existed entirely from non-living materials.> > Scientists are creating new life forms but at the same time, we are creating> > life forms that the human immune system and the world have never so far> > experienced.43As such, it will revitalize perennial questions about the significance of life —what it is, why it is important and what role humans should have in its future.Synthetic genes have then been inserted into a bacterium, which has had its ownoriginal DNA stripped out. Collectively, these DNA/RNA substitutes are calledXNAs.> > One notable property of XNA molecules is they are not biodegradable.

It all began with theRockefeller family.> > The genetic engineering initiative of the Rockefeller Foundation was no spur> > of the moment decision. It was the culmination of the research it had funded> > since the 1930’s.

The people in and around the> > Rockefeller institutions saw it as the ultimate means of social control and> > social engineering – eugenics.> > Borrowing generously from their work in race eugenics, the foundation> > scientists developed the idea of molecular biology from the fundamental> > assumption that almost all human problems could be ‘solved’ by genetic and> > chemical manipulations.> > The foundation’s research goal was to find ways to reduce the infinite> > complexities of life to simple, deterministic and predictive models. The> > promoters of the new molecular biology at the foundation were determined to> > map the structure of the gene and to use that information ‘to correct social> > and moral problems including crime, poverty, hunger and political> > instability.’45Another key associates working for the Rockefellers, and involved in reducinghuman problems to a basic common denominator of death was Dr. Franz J. Kallmann,a psychiatric geneticist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. Dr.Kallmann was also a founding President of a new eugenics front organization, theAmerican Society of Human Genetics which later became a sponsor of the HumanGenome Project.The multibillion-dollar project was, appropriately enough, housed at the sameCold Spring Harbor center that Rockefeller, Harriman and Carnegie had used fortheir notorious Eugenics Research Office in the 1920’s. Genetics, as defined bythe Rockefeller Foundation, would constitute the new face of eugenics.Kallmann was a strong advocate of practicing elimination or forced sterilizationon schizophrenics. In 1938,> > … he demanded the forced sterilization of even healthy offspring of> > schizophrenic parents to kill the genetic line.46In the 1960s and 70s, while brother John D. Rockefeller III was mapping plansfor global depopulation, brothers Nelson and David were busy with the businessside of securing the American Century. American agribusiness was to play adecisive role in this project, and the development of genetic biotechnologywould bring the different efforts of the family into a coherent plan for globalfood control in ways simply unimaginable to most.47That was then.Now, after 10,000 years of natural genetic manipulation by selective breeding,we have finally gained direct access to the genetic code, DNA. We are now doingto genetic engineering what engineers have done since the Stone Age: collect,refine and repackage nature so that it is easier to make new and reliablethings.Welcome to the world of synthetic biology, which in laymen’s terms is geneticmodification. It is the dawn of a new revolution in molecular biology andgenetic engineering.> > Over recent years, Genetic Modification has led to crops that are resistant> > to weed killers or insecticides.

No wonder the phrase“playing God” comes up in almost every conversation. With it comes a grandhistorical vision.Now, what will happen if a private trust or the Pentagon comes to possess majorcellular breakthrough, which has huge implications for mankind? The Pentagonmilitary industrial complex can spread a virus and use a vaccine to extinguish,what the Pentagon calls, undesirable human behavior. Stuff of science fiction,you say?There are many disturbing potentials. We can now build viruses from the genomes.We have already been able to create a synthetic poliovirus. And as Britain’sDaily Mail reported:> > This technique can be used to recreate terrible viruses from our past, like> > Ebola and a 1918 flu strand that killed up to 40 million people.50What’s more, there are easier ways to recreate microbes. You can simply add theright gene to a close relative.The Future is NowWhat about the future? How will this technology be used in the future? It isafter all, a double-edged sword. Take children, for example. Not only willparents have an opportunity to genetically select or to elect their children,building their characteristics block by building block, and in the processcreating a new breed of children – no disease, level of IQ etc., not to mentionmixing in other people’s DNA in with the couple’s to literally produce a newbreed of humans. A question is: If we give our children genes that we don’thave, are they still our children?It can be argued that the child is still you, only the best of you and that acouple could conceive thousands of times without getting the desired resultsavailable through selection. Shouldn’t the couples choose the best in them topass on to their children? And if yes, what does the “best” mean? And in whatsense the best? How do you define morality? Does it have anything to do with thedivine spark of reason? If yes, where does that come from and how can that traitbe mapped through DNA? And if it could, would that mean that a synthetic versionof it could be controlled through biomedicine?As a member of the Rockefeller Foundation board and avowed eugenicist, FrederickOsborn said:> > It would in the end be far easier and more sensible to manufacture a> > complete new man de novo, out of appropriately chosen raw materials, than to> > try to refashion into human form those pitiful relics which remained.51I repeat, the promoters of the new molecular biology at the RockefellerFoundation are determined to correct social and moral problems including crime,poverty, hunger and political instability – all done in the name of populationcontrol and population reduction.But, there is even a far darker element to consider. Parents who misbehave,criminals, dissidents, people who think differently from the official party lineof the One World State could have their children’s DNA altered during pregnancyas punishment for their non-obedience.What’s more, by altering DNA, the private corporations and governments cancreate a society without memory: people, whose life’s experiences are stored ona memory drive running on a one week cycle through a modified DNA, over and overand over again.Are we willing to go this route? Why do I ask? Because then, theBilderberg-controlled bio-companies would hold the key to life in every aspectof your existence. The big question is can we trust the major corporations to dothe right thing? Do scientists have morals? What about the corporations? Andwhat about loyalty? Remember, these mega-corporations historically have held noloyalty to any nation, state or God.Can we trust them with creating life? This is a very important question to ask,because for the first time in history – science can create life. We are givingbirth on daily basis to new astounding technologies.This is not new. In the past 100 years or so, governments began working onbio-weapons – Imperial Japan, Germany, UK, France. And many programs have delvedinto race specific bio-weapons, ones that would eradicate undesired people.The problem with the research is that governments, when working on bio-weapons,generally first try to take zoological bio-weapons like Ebola that affectedapes, and cross it over to humans. There is evidence that this is what happenedwith Ebola.Currently, we have human-cross-species clones growing inside of cow’s uterus sothey can harvest the organs. They are mixing animal life and human. This willallow cross-species diseases that can then only be eradicated through theBilderberg controlled organizations, through human experiments, DNA sampling, orusing synthetic DNA to implant in human beings.People or robots, or is there a new species being created? What about rights,human rights? But then, because they are not human, it can be argued that therights these new organisms have will be more related to animal rights than humanrights.What does the Strategic Trends 2007-2036 report have to say on the subject? Iquote from the report:> > … a more permissive R&D environment could accelerate the decline of ethical> > constraints and restraints. The speed of technological and cultural change> > could overwhelm society’s ability to absorb the ethical implications… The> > nearest approximation to an ethical framework could become a form of secular> > unilateralism, in an otherwise amoral scientific culture.The ultimate form of social Darwinism will be welcomed at last. Francis Galton’sreligion will reign supreme, as younger generations will make eugenics a normalpart of their life.Add to it financial destruction, displacement of people across the world, foodcrisis, wars, famine and decease and you have a perfect storm of depopulation.Again, I quote the Strategic Trends Report,> > Declining youth populations in Western societies could become increasingly> > dissatisfied with their economically burdensome ‘baby boomer elders.…’ Aging> > populations, an increase in medical demand and patient expectations are> > likely to lead to an unsustainable drain on some state health resources and> > to impact on economic prosperity.… Resentful at a generation whose values> > appear to be out of step with tightening resource constraints, the young> > might open the way to policies that permit euthanasia as a means to reduce> > the burden of care for the elderly. This could lead to a civil renaissance> > with strict penalties for those failing to fulfill their social> > obligations.52What they do mean by imposing “strict penalties for those failing to fulfilltheir social obligations?” It means genocide. It means that in the name ofsocial equality, the elderly will be killed to give way for the youngergeneration. The Strategic Trends Report makes it very clear:> > It will also open the way to policies which permit euthanasia as a means to> > reduce the burden of care for the elderly.And there you have it.This is Transhumanism in its purest and most evil form as envisioned by AldousHuxley.In Brave New World, Huxley centers on the scientific methodology for keeping allpopulations outside the elite minority in a permanently autistic-like conditionactually in love with their servitude and producing dictatorship without tears.In a 1961 speech on the U.S. State Department’s Voice of America, Huxley spokeof a world of pharmacologically manipulated slaves, living in a “concentrationcamp of the mind,” enhanced by propaganda and psychotropic drugs, learning to“love their servitude,” and abandoning all will to resist. “This,” Huxleyconcluded, “is the final revolution.”And thus, we’re now at a point, where either the people win, and restore thekind of government we require, in various nations, and among nations. Or thisworld is going to go into Hell, because the crisis won’t quit.> > The people will die of hunger, they will die in increasing numbers; they> > will kill for food. The structure of society will be destroyed in the fight> > over food, which is not there. And therefore, either we win this fight> > against this evil, or there won’t be anything to fight for.53--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 F.

Today, a Bilderberg-dominated, highly centralized groupof powerful individuals and multinational companies own the world news media.Media control and manipulation does not mean that a monolithic “Big Brother”serves up one, and only one distorted version of reality. The media cabaldefines the parameters of what is “news,” and, therefore, shapes the latitude ofthe public discourse and the range of policy options available for debate. Itcontinually disinforms, misinforms, and dumbs-down the populations.What’s imperative to understand is that no matter which media outlet you read,watch, surf or listen to, the entire mainstream and most alternative newssources are controlled by the same interlocking Octopus.Mass Psychology ModelToday’s elite have a precedent: the pagan cult ceremonies of the decadentEgyptian and Roman Empires. And these controlling entities have a history alltheir own. The continuity of the cult of Apollo is important to understand.There are “black nobility” families whose families conjoined politicaltraditions trace back to the Roman empire.> > The republic and empire under which their ancestors lived was in turn> > controlled by Rome branch of the cult of Apollo. That cult, was during that> > time, variously, the chief usurious debt-farming institution of the> > Mediterranean region.1The cult was a political intelligence service, and the creator of other cults.From the death of Alexander the Great until the cult of Apollo dissolved itselfinto the cult of Stoicism, creating during the second century B.C., the base ofthe cult was Ptolemaic Egypt, from which the cult controlled Rome. In Egypt, thecult of Apollo syncretized the cult of Isis and Osiris into a direct imitationof the Phrygian cult of Dionysus and its Roman imitation, the cult of Bacchus.It was there that the cult of Stoic irrationalism was created by the cult ofApollo. It was the cult of Apollo that created the Roman Empire, which thencreated the Roman law on the basis of the antihumanistic AristoteleanNicomachean Ethics. That is the tradition, which the old “black” Roman familiestransmit. These Roman families, over time, became known as the “Venetian BlackNobility.” Today these same families hold key positions within the inner circleof organizations such as the Bilderberg group.This tradition has persisted under various institutional covers, alwayspreserving its essential world-outlook and doctrine intact. The Britishmonarchy, the aristocratic landlord class of Europe, and the European-dominated,feudalist factions of the Maltese Order, are the modern, concentrated expressionof the unbroken tradition and policies of the ancient Apollo cult.An Aristotelean knows that:> > … generalized scientific and technological progress, given the conditions of> > education and liberty of innovation which progress demands, produces in the> > citizen a dedication to the creative potential of the human mind which is> > antithetical to the oligarchic system.> > What the Aristoteleans have hated and feared down through the millennia is> > their knowledge that persistent, generalized scientific and technological> > progress, as the guiding policy of society, means a republican hegemony> > which ends forever the possibility of establishing oligarchic world-rule.2Today’s elite have resorted to the same methods used by the ancient priests ofApollo – the promotion of Dionysian cults of drug-cultures, orgiastic-eroticcountercultures, deranged mobs of “machine-breakers” and terrorist maniacs. Theyuse psychological warfare to turn the combined force of a demented rabbleagainst those forces in society that are dedicated to scientific andtechnological progress.And no better way exists than through the mass brainwashing of the population,and the shortest way to the hearts and minds of the people is through theall-encompassing, global communication.TelevisionThe greatest form of control is when you can be manipulated the population intobelieving that they are free, while they are being dictated to and manipulated.One form of dictatorship is being in a prison cell, seeing the bars. The other,a far more subtle form of dictatorship, where you can’t see the bars, but thinkyou are free. The biggest hypnotist in the world is that oblong box in thecorner of the room that tells people what to believe. Television, with its reachinto everyone’s home, creates the basis for the mass brainwashing of citizens.> > Television causes people to suspend their critical judgment capabilities> > because the combination of sound and images places the individual in a> > dream-like state, which limits cognitive powers.3Hal Becker from the Futures Group contends that through the control oftelevision-news programming, he can create popular opinion by manipulating theway you think and act.> > Americans think they are governed by some bureaucrats in Washington who make> > laws and hand out money. How wrong they are. Americans are ruled by their> > prejudices and their prejudices are organized by public opinion.… We think> > that we make up our minds about everything. We are so conceited. Public> > opinion makes up our minds. It works our herd instinct, like we are> > frightened animals.But there is a very big difference between beast and man. A major difference isin our search for eternal Truth – for the meaning of Life. Truth lies in ahigher order of processes and in the creative powers of the individual humanmind. It’s a moral problem, and a problem of mankind’s destiny, one, which noanimal can ever solve.Every generation must advance beyond that of the preceding generation. And thathope – that it will happen – should be what’s on the mind of a person dying ofold age: that their life has meant something, and has helped to create a betterworld than they knew.Polling by NumbersStereotypes are created, and manipulated, by the gurus of mass communication andpsychological warfare. The idea is not to make you think too clearly, or tooprofoundly about the images you receive, but instead to react in a Pavlovianmanner, to the stimuli provided.Edward Bernays, Freud’s nephew and one of the founders of public opinionmanipulation techniques stated that:> > We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas> > suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. Whatever attitude one> > chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost> > every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business,> > our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by a relatively> > small number of persons, a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty> > million [U.S. citizens at the time], who understand the mental processes and> > social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires, which control> > the public mind, and who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to> > bind and guide the world.”4In this manner, irrationality has been elevated to a high level of publicconsciousness. The manipulators then play upon this irrationality to undermineand distract the grasp of reality governing any given situation. And as theproblems of a modern industrial society become more complex, the easier it is tobring greater and greater distractions to bear, so that what we ended up with isthe absolutely inconsequential opinions of masses of people, created by skilledmanipulators. These “opinions” are then assumed as representatives of“scientific” facts.We are talking about Freudian mass psychology and its appeal to infantilist,animal-like behavior, the touchy-feely thing, designed to bypass the creativereasoning powers of individuals, informed by moral judgment and the eternalsearch for universal Truth.In fact, when it comes to television, the issue of truth has never been anissue. Television is not the truth. Television is an amusement park, a group ofjugglers, belly dancers, storytellers, singers and stripers. But we, the people,have been completely hypnotized by the Tube. You sit there; day after day, nightafter night – TV is most of what you know! Five percent of Americans read morethan five books per year (around 15 million folk), yet one billion peoplewatched the Oscar awards. You dream like a tube, speak like a tube, smell,dress, act like your television. Most people feel they are better acquaintedwith Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or Lady Gaga than with their own husband orwife. This is madness!How many millions of you are prepared to believe anything the tube tells you?What’s more, the people at the top are prepared to tell you anything in the nameof “war against terror,” audience share and advertising dollars, as long as youvote for them, buy their products and allow them to brainwash you.> > Television provided an ideal means to create a homogenous culture, a mass> > culture, through which popular opinion could be shaped and controlled, so> > that everyone in the country would think the same.5Again, television is not about the “truth,” it is about creating a reality. Itdoes not matter one bit whether the images you see on television are real orcopied and pasted from past events, because people believe them to be real,immediate and thus true.For example, during the March 2010 earthquake in Japan, the mass media showedimages of empty supermarket shelves, and stated brazenly that Japan wasundergoing the worst water rationing since World War II.However, the images of empty shelves were taken from stock photography and hadlittle to do with the earthquake or lack of bottled water. In this way, reality,as conveyed by the nightly news, obliterates Truth every night. Emery and Tristindicated that:> > …the more a person watches television, the less he understands, the more he> > accepts, the more he becomes dissociated from his own thought process …> > television is much more magical than any other consumer product because it> > makes things normal, it packages and homogenizes fragmentary aspects of> > reality. It constructs an acceptable reality (the myth) out of largely> > unacceptable ingredients. To confront the myth would be to admit that one> > was ineffective, isolated and incapable.… It (television images) becomes and> > is the truth.”The brainwashers-in-charge of this societal transformation have pulled off theultimate trick: They have been able to persuade us that what we have been shownis all that there is to see. Subsequently, people will laugh in your face whenyou try to explain to them a bigger picture and the unseen reality behind thecurtain.What became obvious to the brainwashers is that an appeal to emotionalism wasneeded in order to break through the population’s moral compass – society neededto be reduced to infantilism.Writing in 1972, Tavistock’s leading media expert, Dr. Fred Emery, reported ontelevision’s impact on Americans:> > We are suggesting that television evokes a basic assumption of dependency.> > It must evoke (this) because it is essentially an emotional and irrational> > activity … television is the non-stop leader who provides nourishment and> > protection.In an informative report on television’s impact on the cognitive powers of anindividual, investigative journalist, Lonnie Wolfe says that both Emery and EricTrist, who until his death in 1993 headed Tavistock’s operations in the UnitedStates, noted that:> > all television had a dissociative effect on mental capabilities, making> > people less able to think rationally. Viewers, as they become habituated to> > watching six hours or more of television daily, surrender their powers of> > reason to the images and sound coming from the tube.6Tavistock recognized that habituated television watching destroys the ability ofa person for critical cognitive activity. In other words, it makes you stupid.To bring society down to the level of a beast is especially important from thepoint of view of Tavistock, especially if they are to control the planet Earth.> > Since the only source of increase of mankind’s power, as a species, within> > and upon the universe, is that manifold of validated discoveries of physical> > principle, it follows, that the only form of human action that distinguished> > man from beast, is that form of action, which is identified as cognition, by> > means of which the act of discovery of accumulated verifiable universal> > physical principles is generated. It is the accumulation of such knowledge> > for practice, in this way, from generation to generation, which defines the> > provable evidence of the absolute difference between man and beast.7This alleged myth is at the heart of the control mechanism the elite are usingto manipulate the people. Most Americans and Europeans believe there is such athing as a free press. This is one of the key areas in brainwashing apopulation. And most Americans and Europeans get majority of their news fromstate-controlled television, under the misconception that reporters are meant toserve the public by offering the people critical choices and distinct points ofview. In fact, reporters do not serve the public and the elite controls all the pointsof view. Reporters are paid employees and serve the media owners, whosecompany’s shares are traded on Wall Street. In other words, the people who ownthe media tell us what to think.By controlling the extremes of this system, the elite have manipulated peopleinto believing that the choices we make are independent and are based on accessto critical information. When in fact, the information we receive throughmainstream corporate media is part of a manipulation and control.For example, what do international terrorism; the world’s financial markets,empire builders and capitalism have in common? Their utter dependence on drugprofits for their very existence.The war on drugs is a sham. In researching global cash flows, it is staggeringto find out that the amount of profit generated annually by the drug trade isclose to a trillion dollars per year in cash.Drug money is now an essential part of the world’s banking and financial systembecause it provides the liquid cash necessary to make the monthly payments onthe huge stock and derivate investment bubbles. However, you never hear thisfrom the corporate media because it is run by the same financial and politicalinterests whom control and profit from the nefarious drug business.> > American media elites practice a brutal, albeit well-concealed, form of> > ‘wartime’ news censorship, but the mechanisms of this control are now openly> > acknowledged.

It is also the premier US foreign policy think tank in theUnited States, and is one of the central institutions for socializing Americanelites from all major sectors of society. It is where they work together toconstruct a consensus on major issues related to American imperial interestsaround the world. As such, the CFR often sets the strategy for American policy,and wields enormous influence within policy circles, where key players often andalmost always come from the rank and file of the CFR itself.America’s corporate media is an integral part of the economic establishment,with links to Wall Street, the Washington think tanks, Club Bilderberg and theCouncil on Foreign Relations (CFR) and through them to the world’s topbrainwashing center, Tavistock Institute. CFR is:> > … the premier U.S. foreign policy think tank in the United States, and is> > one of the central institutions for socializing American elites from all> > major sectors of society (media, banking, academia, military, intelligence,> > diplomacy, corporations, NGOs, civil society, etc.), where they work> > together to construct a consensus on major issues related to American> > imperial interests around the world. As such, the CFR often sets the> > strategy for American policy, and wields enormous influence within policy> > circles, where key players often and almost always come from the rank and> > file of the CFR itself.10In a October 30, 1993 “Ruling Class Journalists” essay, Washington Postombudsman Richard Harwood candidly discussed how powerful, private and semisecret organizations such as the Bilderberg Group dominates the news media: “Theeditorial page editor, deputy editorial page editor, executive editor, managingeditor, foreign editor, national affairs editor, business and financial editorand various writers as well as (the now deceased) Katherine Graham, the paper’sprincipal owner, represent the Washington Post in the council’s membership,”observed Harwood. These media heavyweights “do not merely analyze and interpretforeign policy for the United States; they help make it,” he concluded.Rather than offering an independent perspective on our rulers’ actions, theEstablishment media act as the ruling elite’s voice – conditioning the public toaccept, and even embrace “insider” designs that otherwise might not bepolitically attainable.Social Media – The Mighty WurlitzerAlmost simultaneously, these perspectives presented in the form of popularopinion are echoed through the Social Media Networks, giving a greater andgreater propagation to the disinformation, misinformation, and distorted realitywhich then spreads like wildfire through Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, Pinterest,Flickr, Digg, Technorati, Messenger, Tweetpeek, Ning, LinkedIn, and endlessothers.Think about the power of the Internet.In one day on the Internet, enough information is consumed to fill 168 millionDVDs, 294 billion emails are sent, 2 million blog posts are written (enoughposts to fill Time magazine for 770 million years), 172 million people visitFacebook, 40 million visit Twitter, 22 million visit LinkedIn, 20 million visitGoogle+, 17 million visit Pinterest, 4.7 billion minutes are spent on Facebook,250 million photos are uploaded, 22 million hours of TV and movies are watchedon Netflix, 864,000 hours of video are uploaded to YouTube, more than 35 millionapplications are downloaded and more iPhones are sold than people are born.11All in a 24-hour span.Do you want to know how to make the world believe anything? Through mediacontrol. You put something on the television and on the Internet, and it becomesreality. You transmit anything through the social media and it too, becomesreality, through the power of repetition. And people start trying to change theworld to make it like the TV set images and social media gossip.Just look at the statistics.Forty-two percent of Americans watch TV while they’re on their laptops, smartphones or tablets. 31% of those aged 50+ are talking “TV” on social media, 27%25-35 and 12% up to 18 years. 77% of social network users tweet to tell friendswhat they’re watching.12 Every month the online population spends equivalent of4 million years online. These are not empty numbers. These numbers representpeople. And people represent access to unbelievable amount of information abouttheir lives, their likes, tastes, dislikes, prejudices and tendencies. These arecatalogued, analyzed, adjusted to the needs of the elite and presented inready-made formats for consumption in ways that project the elite’s point ofview. This is how they brainwash you, every minute of every day through theirubiquitous control of every media channel available.This is the real meaning of “mass audience.” The concept behind it was the sameas discussed by Freud in Mass Psychology, that is:> > … individuals participating in the mass phenomenon are susceptible to> > suggestion, to losing his moral conscience – thus become overwhelmed by the> > mass experience.An individual can be made to transfer his or her identity to the group, whereinthey become subjected to the most intense forms of suggestion. Providing thatthe individual’s inner sense of real identity is destroyed, he can bemanipulated like a child. And as Lord Bertrand Russell wrote in his 1951 book,The Impact of Science on Society:> > The social psychologists of the future will have a number of classes of> > school children on whom they will try different methods of producing an> > unshakable conviction that snow is black.13Today, with almost 70% of the world adult population using social media, it hasbecoming easier than ever before. Out of these 70%, 4 out of 5 use smart phonesto connect to social media. By the year 2015, the number of smart phones in usewill reach one billion units.This billion will be dominated by Apple, Google and Microsoft, who will enjoy90% of market share with their respective platforms. These are Bilderberg-runcompanies. A billion smart phones connected to the happy world of ever after.And this liberating experience comes at a price. It is called surveillance. Yes,you are being watched, listened to, and profiled and catalogued 24/7.14One Happy FamilyIn fact, cell phones are one of the three most important breakthroughs in thesurveillance game. The others are GPS and the ability to watch us. The cellulartelephone has become an extension of our bodies 24/7, which means, yourwhereabouts are known at all time. Also, there is Skyhook, “the fastest, mostaccurate, most reliable and most flexible location system on the markettoday.”15People with smart phones with GPS, Google employees in special vehicles movingaround the world are recording the coordinates of all WI-FI. Each router and itslocation are being recorded!This is but the tip of the proverbial iceberg. New search capabilities andindexes, including translation, speech recognition technology, text recognitionin videos are some of the latest innovation which have changed the rules of thegame – smart cameras with block recognition of numbers, letters and faces linkedto massive high-speed databases put everyone on the grid.The main thing that has changed – nothing is removed, nothing is erased, andnothing is forgotten. Everything you’ve ever done; every stupid picture you haveposted, every nasty blog on a bad day and off-color joke, every text –everything is kept forever. Forever!It is stored, and not just stored; it is indexed and linked – tied to your nameforever. A profile is created of you in a database available to the governmentand the intelligence community. And you haven’t even done anything!But that’s not the point. The point is that your privacy has been violatedforever in the name of whatever “-ism” that is in vogue at the moment. And if itis not in vogue, don’t worry, it will be, just as soon as the government givesit legitimacy and fully promotes it through the Internet and the social networksusing their agents of change as the battering ram against anyone who mightobject.Total Surveillance NetworkA decade ago, the backbone of the Total Surveillance network was an activitycalled “data mining” or knowledge discovery, which is the automated extractionof hidden predictive information from databases which consisted of massivecollection of information about people’s lives, from multiple sources – abewildering plethora of state-of-the-art technology and custom-designeddata-gathering software, including RFID microchips, biometrics, DNA chips andimplantable GPS chips, keyword search programs that sift through large databasesof text-based documents and messages looking for keywords and phrases based oncomplex algorithmic criteria. Voice recognition programs convert conversations,targeting an individual’s voice pattern, into text messages for furtheranalysis. That was 10 years ago. That’s an eon in computer terms.Compare with an early December 2012 proposal from members of the United Nation’sInternational Telecommunications Union (ITU) who have agreed to work towardsimplementing a standard for the Internet that would allow for eavesdropping on aworldwide scale.> > At a conference in Dubai this week, the ITU members decided to adopt the> > Y.2770 standard for deep packet inspection, a top-secret proposal by way of> > China that will allow telecom companies across the world to more easily dig> > through data passed across the Web.”16Today, privacy does not exist. Shame does not exist. Anonymously and openly,people all over the world post everything there is about them on the Internetvia Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, etc: name, address, phone number, where you wentto school, where you work, who your friends are, your attitude towards anendless array of issues, both political and social, what you did last night,last week, or last year, and so on.Endless quantities of information about you – the Stasi’s wet dream come true;and all of it is available on the Web – for free. Why do people do that? Becausewe’re convinced that our Instagram snaps and Twitter quips are pure genius, thatour very special self-expression is unique, witty, and brimming with creativevalue, when in fact, they are boring, predictable for the most part and mostlythe illiterate ramblings of a dead brain.Social media, in fact, has given status to the “celebrity” which few real menattain. And what is a “celebrity” if not the ultimate human pseudo-event,fabricated on purpose to satisfy our exaggerated expectations of humangreatness. This is the ultimate success story of the twenty-first century andits pursuit of illusion. A new mold has been made, so that marketable humanmodels – modern ‘heroes’, can be mass-produced, to satisfy a market, and allwithout any hitches. The qualities that now commonly make a man or woman into a“nationally advertised” brand are in fact a new category of human emptiness.The world we have been peering into is somehow beyond good and evil. It is aworld of sentimentality, of makeovers, of people who are willing to shed a tearin front of the whole world.Instead of saying indefensible things and trusting that the audience will lovethem anyway, they explain their hardships and plead their case in front of thewhole world, which is a very unreasonable thing to do. I find it disturbing tosee people allowing themselves to be used like Kleenex, but then everybody elsein our trash culture appropriates profound concepts for shallow ends. Initialtriumphalism giving way to grudged defeatism – is today’s human psyche as seenthrough the prismatic binoculars of an intrusively globalised, theraupeutisedand “Coca-colised” world morality.Twitter – Blue Bird of HappinessIn an insightful piece entitled “Symbolic Literacy,” author Michael Tsarionobserves that we suffer from “chronic symbol illiteracy” and that we aresubjected to subliminal and subtextual persuasion that constitutes what herefers to as a psychic dictatorship.This dictatorship, Tsarion says, “involves the deliberate and subversivemanipulation and public purveyance of words, images, numbers, colors, rhythms,and symbols which are subsequently directed, via ubiquitous media oracles,toward the limbic areas of the human brain,” which, he continues, “produces anelaborate and insidious cryptic language specifically designed to stimulateconflict between fantasy and reality.”Symbols are oracular forms, “mysterious patterns creating vortices in thesubstances of the invisible world. They are centers of a mighty force, figurespregnant with an awful power, which, when properly fashioned, loose fierywhirlwinds upon the earth.”17 How many people have asked themselves what is thedictionary definition of Ground Zero, why Google is called Google and what doesthe word mean, if anything. Why Twitter is called Twitter and what is themeaning of the cute little blue bird the company uses as it’s universallyrecognized image?The “Land of Memory” has always been the primary objective of mind control andcounter-insurgency operations. There is a phrase which is not used as much thesedays: “the blue bird of happiness.”What many people do not realize is that this term had its origins in The BlueBird (1909), a most famous work by the Belgian Nobel Prize-winning author anddramatist, Maurice Maeterlinck. In this play, two children set off on a searchfor the “Blue Bird of Happiness.” This search leads them on many adventures – akind of initiatory quest for the Holy Grail. Many of the motifs of Maeterlinck’splay are repeated in the CIA’s search for perfecting mind control, a search thatbegan with “Project Bluebird.”The Land of Memory, of course, was the target of the Bluebird project: to enterthat Land, in another person’s mind, to go through the drawers, rearranging thefurniture, and leave unnoticed. Once the Korean War started, and American POWsbegan making bizarre, pro-Communist statements after a mysterious sojourn inManchuria, the world was introduced to the concept of ‘brainwashing,’ and theBluebird took on enormous importance.If the Communists could alter the consciousness of American soldiers, then “war”took on a completely different nature: it became a war of culture againstculture, of atheism against religion, of race against race, of Darkness againstLight. This was a war not to be fought by bullets alone; psychological warfareoperations were ramped up at the same time as Bluebird went into full swing, andwhat William Sargant would call in 1957, “The Battle for the Mind,” had began.Through an “innocent” child’s tale, brainwashers and counter-insurgencyoperatives have embarked on a “sacred” quest that would lead them intohumanity’s deepest secrets; by delving into the universal, macrocosmic secretsof the human mind, they hoped to uncover the specific, microcosmic secrets oftheir enemies.These people have used their understanding of psychiatric methods to formulateand implement an action program based upon such beliefs. Once the neurotic mapof each individual was determined, the government was able to set up a“filtering” mechanism, which are the different forms of brainwashing, to selectvarious neurotic types and place them in their appropriate settings.The psychopathic kernel of their long-range vision is:> > … converting the automized individual’s world into a controlled> > environment.18On one level, the technique is being applied to the world of intelligence, buton another level a far more hideous use has been envisioned by the practitionersof the art of brainwashing.The most advanced among the brutal practitioners of this new industrialpsychology was Dr. John Rawlings Rees, one of the founders of Tavistock Clinic,world’s center for mass brainwashing and social engineering activities.Rees discovered that an unreal realm could be created: the social group. Anindividual can be made to transfer his or her identity to the group, whereinthey become subjected to the most intense forms of suggestion. Provided that theindividual’s inner sense of real identity is destroyed, he can then bemanipulated like a child.This is the objective of Social Networks. Welcome to the macabre world ofTwitter.Furthermore, what few people are aware of is that Twitter is now stored in theUnited States Library of Congress. I repeat, each tweet is transferred to theLibrary of Congress. You thought that your tweets are gone? No! Every tweetyou’ve ever done is stored forever in the Library of Congress.Nothing can be changed – what you put on the web, or tweet, or blog, or SMS(text), or a Web page or a Web page that you removed 15 seconds after thepublication. Nothing. Once you have uploaded it, the system absorbs it into itsown system, indexes it, and ties to your name – ready for someone to read it, touse it. This is data mining 2013, person-specific, instantaneous and ubiquitous.What’s more, every Tweet is constantly being monitored by marketing specialists,private detectives, intelligence agencies, governments, anti-terrorism experts,social scientists, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. – whether your name is SantaMaria Goretti, Pope Francisco I or Ivan Ivanovitch Ivanov.As of June 2013, Twitter has more than 500 million active users, sending 500million tweets every day on every conceivable topic. The amount of informationavailable through every one of your tweets boggles the mind, and with it, theprofiling, the cataloging of you and every one of the people you are in touchwith. It is done every minute of every day 24/7/365.Most people think Twitter has only 140 characters when in fact every tweet is agoldmine of information. There’s your IP-address, location, when you opened yourTwitter account; in other words, 34-37 pieces of data in each Twitter tape.Russia Today reported:> > … the US government requests for user data in the second half of 2012 is> > equivalent to just over 80 percent of all inquiries. Twenty percent of all> > US requests were ‘under seal,’ meaning that users were not notified that> > their information was accessed.19Furthermore, Twitter interacts with Facebook. It’s like a big invader of privacyto merge with a private life, and together they now mega-invade your privacy.But the fact that you’re texting every hour on Twitter, updating your Facebookaccount, and constantly sending text messages, is not unusual. In fact, it isconsidered perfectly normal in today’s society.Twitter conversations are real-time statements from millions of people frommoment to moment. They hold a wealth of information. How does the world’s moodchange throughout the day as a result of a particular event or a whole series ofchanges, orchestrated or otherwise? Twitter and social media allows a person tounderstand systems. It allows you to capture conversations on the societalscale, see them all and put them in perspective from a much higher plateau,something that was, up till now, impossible.Group ThinkSocial marketing, used to be called “group think,” the essence of which, is thatyou like what your friends like, and you vote the way your friends vote. You arewhat your friends are. That’s why Facebook is worth so much money.Facebook has more than one billion users, a seventh of the world’s population.Facebook, with its clean image and reputation, gives the feeling that behind itslogo you will find idealistic and young entrepreneurs, when in fact, those trulyholding the reins of Facebook, are the elite.In 2005, Mark Zuckerberg said,> > Facebook develops technologies that facilitate the sharing of information> > through the social graph; it is the digital zapping of the real-world social> > connections of users.Wow!The above mentioned social graph is nothing but pure thought control. Is thatwhat Facebook is? Two members of the board of directors of Facebook are PeterThiel and Jim Breyer. Thiel gave Zuckerberg $ 500,000 in 2004 to launchFacebook. Who is Peter Thiel? He is a member of the Steering Committee ofBilderebrg Group. Theil founded Stanford Review in 1987, and was a co-founder ofPayPal in 1998.Another Facebook board member, Jim Breyer, is also a board member ofAnglo-American Accel Partners, a venture capital risk fund. Accel gaveZuckerberg $ 12.7 million in 2005 for development of a site where:> > … people can find other people like them, and find relevant information> > about their lives … their interests, information about your school, family,> > photos, likes and friends.Now, why would a highly speculative, financial company be interested incontrolling a social networking website?Another character very involved with Facebook is Bill Gates. In September 2006,a month after signing the strategic partnership, Facebook introduced Minifeedand Newsfeed, two applications aimed at monitoring and reporting the real-timeactivity of each of the users of the network, even when the user is notconnected to Facebook.In November 2007, Gates invested $ 240 million to give twelve super-corporationsaccess to the overall monitoring network. Among these twelve companies areCoca-Cola and video purveyor, Blockbuster.How does this system work? For example: John Smith rents a video at aBlockbuster, and all information is sent immediately to Facebook and thereafterit becomes a part of Newsfeed. When any member of John Smith’s circle of friendsgoes to his Facebook page they see immediately all their movements as well asthose of John Smith and any other member of his network.What’s worse, this information is part of the instant composite sketch of JohnSmith, that super-corporations then store for later use in a limitless virtualrepository. The goal is not only to get to know the user’s profile, but also toknow their way of thinking and acting. This is being done as we speak, all thetime with every one of the billion users of Facebook.However, Facebook isn’t alone. Amazon offers their suggestions on books based onyour profile, films you want to see, products you would want to buy for yourloved ones. So does Facebook, MySpace, and countless other websites.Mr. Thiel, in a speech at Stanford University in 2004, talked about acceleratingchange and bringing people to the virtual world ASAP. In Thiel´s unforgettablewords:> > … controlling information is the same as controlling the human mind.We may not realize it, but the elite certainly do.Remember, everything that happens, everything you do, regardless of theimportance of the event, is photographed, videoed, posted, discussed, tweeted,and voted on social media networks.Then, there is MySpace. It absorbs a massive amount of information: name, dateof birth, city, schools, places of work. Music - which, by the way, says a lotabout you. What books you read – says a great deal about you. Your friends –tells people almost all they need to know about you. Where you live, yourhobbies, your kids, your parents, your brothers and sisters, family ties, andphotos, photos, photos are a cornerstone for investigators. Another cornerstone– your permanent location.The big question as far as social media networks are concerned, “Who are yourfriends?” Again, if they know who your friends are, they know everything aboutyou. And this is the very essence of Facebook.Over one billion people use Facebook; that is 20% of all Internet users in theworld. About 43% of Americans use Facebook. This is mind-boggling penetration.What is Facebook doing? According to Wired magazine: “The colonization of theWeb.”What is the fundamental difference between Facebook and Google? Google indexesthe entire Internet, and Facebook users indexes Facebook. And both of thesecorporations focus on each of us, individually, like a laser. They want to know– what you read, what you do, where you do it, who your friends are, your age,your gender, your religion, your orientation – everything. You are being indexed– cataloguedFacebook Connect and Open Stream are great business models that allow thesemega-corporations to learn everything about you.How many people have spent the time to read their license agreement withFacebook? Zero percent. Read it. You will be horrified to learn what you signed.Facebook simply swallows everything that somehow clarifies information aboutyou. Facebook has bought FriendFeed; they interact with Twitter, and currentlyFacebook is buying travel sites because as soon as they find out where you aretraveling, they want to be in a position to offer you tourist resources.It goes without saying that every top Facebook executive has attended at leastone Bilderberg meeting. The same can be said about top executives fromMicrosoft, Apple, and Google.In 2012, Bilderberg discussed “How Do Sovereign States Collaborate in CyberSpace?” In 2011, one of the key items on the agenda dealt with, “Connectivityand the Diffusion of Power.” The discussion specifically centered on the need tocontrol the Internet as one of the key mechanism for overall control of society.In 2010, Bilderberg vigorously discussed “Social Networking: From the ObamaCampaign to the Iranian Revolution.” The discussion focused on ways to usesocial media as agent of regime change throughout the world.At the 2009 Bilderberg conference in Greece and at the 2008 conference inChantilly, Virginia, the attendees examined “Cyber-terrorism: Strategy andPolicy.” The policy dealt with data mapping everyone – using the World Wide Web.Then there is this about Microsoft. How many of you know what Cassandra is?Cassandra is a program that absorbs every drop of your information on Facebook.Microsoft needed to analyze and dissect you, so they created their own program –to invade of your privacy.Have a look at the “Open Graph,” connecting your Facebook account and youractions within Facebook with things outside of Facebook. Amazon contains yoursearch history and the history of all your purchases. Which means yourinterests, your health and your political views are an open book. Never forgetthat every online action of yours falls into a database – and never disappears.EBay, PayPal and Skype – how many people know that this is one company! EBay.This company knows everything about you. And most importantly, they know yourfinancial information. They have your bank account, your credit card, and yourhome delivery address. This too is data mining, 2013 version – more powerful,more accurate and much faster than ever before.The Scary World of GoogleLet’s start by saying that Google is not a lovey-dovey cute little company witha funny name, but rather a fierce, aggressive, predatory corporation. The term“Googol” is a word invented in 1938 by a 9-year-old Milton Sirotta, nephew to afamous American mathematician, Edward Kasner. Googol is an infinite number, a 1followed by 100 zeroes. Infinity has no limits, but then, neither does Google ordid you truly think that the owners of the company simply pulled a name out of ahat? Remember, limitless anything, spells c-o-n-t-r-o-l.Corporation exists for the sake of profit. Google is also an integral part ofthe United States security apparatus. It collects and integrates everythingthat’s already in the Google ecosystem: your messages, activities calendar,location data, search preferences, contacts, and personal habits based on Gmailchatter, and search queries. This information is processed, analyzed and storedfor later use. Googol = infinity = control.In January 2012, Google announced plans to integrate users’ information acrossGmail, YouTube, Google search and 57 other Google services such as Google Chat,GTalk, Google news, Google Maps, Google Music, Google finance, Google Checkout(PayPal competitor), and Google Video. That was one year ago.Another of Google’s new toys is their Google Goggles, an augmented reality. Theproduct allows a user to take a picture of a picture, and it will tell youeverything anyone needs to know about this picture. Everyone will want to knowwhat your phone sees. So they will encourage the use of it: scan bar codes,people, places and the unilateral identification of different images (things andactions) – an augmented, annotated reality.How can they do all of this? Because they own Picasa, an image viewer fororganizing and editing digital photos. Combine that with face recognitiontechnology, and Google, a Bilderberg-influenced company, has the technology toinstantaneously recognize, identify, process and catalogue everyone who is inthese photographs!Again, how many people have read the Terms of Service for Google mobile? Zero!You, the consumer, give them the right to keep a permanent record, store,archive, and resell your location. And since GPS and Skyhook are now on mostphones, they always know your location – within 3 meters!Another revolutionary products is Google TV. How many of you know that Google iscurrently working with Logitech, Sony, and Dish network, to create a new seriesof applications? Why is this important? Because these are Bilderberg-affliatedcorporations. Google will know when you sleep, when you wake up, when you watchpornography or whatever you see, while sitting in front of the TV.What you watch, says a lot about you. How much time you spend watching TV, saysa lot about you. When you get home, says a lot about you.In March 2012, Google filed a petition for:> > Advertising based on environmental conditions… using temperature, humidity,> > light and air composition.…”In other words, Google is planning to use the ambient background noise of aperson’s environment to build a psychological profile of your entire life –opening a Pandora’s Box of surveillance opportunities.At the end of December 2012, a new service from Google:> > … merged offline consumer info with online intelligence, allowing> > advertisers to target users based on what they do at the keyboard and at the> > mall. Without much fanfare, Google announced news of a new advertising> > project, Conversions API, that will let businesses build all-encompassing> > user profiles based off of not just what users search for on the Web, but> > what they purchase outside of the home.”20Why do they need to know so much about you? Control and power. The more theycontrol the population, the more powerful they are. Google is no longer acompany or even a mega-corporation. Google has become, for all intents andpurposes, an all-seeing eye; what conspiracy theorists like to call: the NewWorld Order. Not quite, but you can see it from there.But Google isn’t the only one. Verizon recently filed a patent for:> > … gesture recognition technology.This would mean that your TV would effectively spy on you 24/7.> > Verizon’s technology would operate in the same way Google targets Gmail> > users based on the content of their emails – only transposing that principle> > into the home by scanning conversations of viewers that are within a> > ‘detection zone’ near their TV, including telephone conversations.”21Former CIA Director David Petraeus lauded this development as transformational,“because it would open up a world of new opportunities for ‘clandestinetradecraft,’ or in other words, make it easier for intelligence agencies andgovernments to spy on you.”22“Once upon a time, spies had to place a bug in your chandelier to hear yourconversation. With the rise of the ‘smart home,’ you’d be sending tagged,geo-located data that a spy agency can intercept in real time when you use thelighting app on your phone to adjust your living room’s ambiance,” reports Wiredmagazine.“Items of interest will be located, identified, monitored, and remotelycontrolled through technologies such as radio-frequency identification, sensornetworks, tiny embedded servers, and energy harvesters – all connected to thenext-generation Internet using abundant, low cost, and high-power computing –the latter now going to cloud computing, in many areas greater and greatersupercomputing, and, ultimately, heading to quantum computing,” Petraeus toldattendees at a meeting for the CIA’s non-profit venture capital firm In-Q-Tel.Murky RelationshipsIn 2006, it was revealed that AT&T provided the National Security Agency (NSA)full access to its customers’ Internet traffic. The data mining equipment wasinstalled in a NSA backdoor, the NARUS STA6400, developed by Narus, a whollyowned subsidiary of Boeing, whose partners were funded by In-Q-Tel.But as potentially as alarming as this all-pervasive monitoring is, and asdisturbing as Google’s interest in data mining technologies might be, the CIAventure capital arm is interested in more than just web-traffic monitoring andyour holiday photos.In-Q-Tel was formed by the CIA in 1999, with a mission to:> > …delivering technology to America’s intelligence community.

In> > reality, however, what In-Q-Tel represents is a dangerous blurring of the> > lines between the public and private sectors in a way that makes it> > difficult to tell where the American intelligence community ends and the IT> > sector begins.23So, who is behind the CIA front company? Founding CEO of In-Q-Tel is GilmanLouie, member of the Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in theInformation Age – a CIA front company. According to Markle Foundation, theirstrategic mission is:> > … to develop revolutionary technology for the world’s largest repository in> > order to create a virtual, centralized database.Louie’s long time business partner has been Jim Breyer, who shares the Board ofAccel-KKR with the founders of Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts, (KKR), an equityfirm who made a name for themselves in the 1980s for economy-destroyingleveraged buyouts.

Not you making screen shots of your privatephotos on your phone, but the Android itself takes the screen shots without yourpermission. Regular screenshots of everything you do on your phone is stored inthe memory. Again, they don’t ask for your permission, they simply do it. Areyou are upset at this invasion of privacy? You shouldn’t be. You gave them theright to spy on you. You don’t believe me? Read the terms of service. They havethe right to spy on you and you cannot do anything to stop them because you donot want to live without your smart phone, even if it has infringed on every oneof your unalienable rights.iPhone – Apple is a key corporation for the Bilderberg Group. Remember, all ofthese entities are not independently run, especially with Steve Jobs deceased.The Bilderberg-affiliated companies form part of a continuum; a dynamic systemthat changes with the times, absorbs and creates new parts, while excreting theremains of the decaying parts. Members come and go, but the system itself hasnot changed. It is a self-perpetuating system, a virtual spider web ofinterlocked financial, political, economic and industry interests based on theold Venetian ultramontane fondi model at the center. “Fondi” means pond inItalian, we are talking here about a system where shared financing leads toshared goals.Venice today is the supranational homeland of a New Dark Age gang. Venice is aunifying symbol for the most extreme Utopian lunatic fringe and ideologicalfanaticism that radiates from numerous foundations, think tanks, private andsemi private organizations acting as agents of a depopulation anddeindustrialization agenda. The names change but the business model and theobjectives always remain the same.Apple and Google may seemingly compete for the same souls as clients, but inactuality they form part of a continuum that is closely collaborating with theelite on controlling the world. Through interlocked directorships andinvestments in common projects, these corporations work closely with powerfulworldwide and US think thanks and foundations such as the: RAND Corporation,Hoover Institution, Hudson Institute, Brookings, American Enterprise Institute,Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Foundation, Aspen Institute,Club of Rome, Pilgrims Society, Atlantic Council, World Resources Institute,Council of Americas, Gorbachev Foundation, National Endowment for Democracy andliterally thousands of others across the planet.Apple, along with most companies, data mines every bit of information availableto it. You are the focus. Your habits are the focus. You are the guinea pig.They know everything about you. Everything.It seems less is known about Yahoo than about Google, but they have almost asmany email accounts as Gmail. They have Yahoo groups, My Yahoo, web hosting,e-commerce, and are well positioned in Europe and Asia. Yahoo, immediately warnsyou – “When you register with Yahoo, and come into our services, you are notanonymous.” Think about the meaning.Your browser with its plug-ins, your actions, cookies, the trail you leavebehind while you surf the Net, is absolutely unique. Your browser acts as anidentifier, a digital identifier of you. But, there is more. Many things thatidentify you are located on the server and not on your computer. Put that incontext, especially now that Google (Google Fiber) has become a full-fledgedInternet provider.Clue in, people, the truth is that all the communications happening on theplanet right now can be monitored in near real-time.Why is all of this being done: to control you, to dumb you down, to brainwashyou, to influence you, to predict your future behavior – to turn you into atouchy-feely adult with infantile tendencies. So you don’t get in the way ofimportant people by doing too much thinking on your own. Think about it – if youstill know how!I am being serious.Over 85% of people get all their information from the television and socialmedia networks. In fact, the only “truth” most people know is what they get overthe television or social media networks. There is now an entire generation ofpeople who have not know anything that didn’t come out of this tube.This medium has become the Gospel, the ultimate revelation. It can make or breakpresidents and Prime Ministers. This tube is the most awesome force in thisgod-damn world. However, what would happen if it got into the hands of the wrongpeople? And when the largest company in the world controls the most awesomepropaganda force in the entire Universe, who knows what shit will be peddled fortruth?Let’s put it this way: “The advent and mass dissemination of televisiontechnology has rendered the Nazi model for a fascist society obsolete; it hasprovided a better, more subtle, and more powerful means of social control thanthe organized terror of the Nazi state”27 and help subtly advance the cause ofworld government – without even explicitly stating that world government or OneWorld Company is the goal.Brainwashers call it “institutional human aggressiveness,” what people likeFreud say proves that people, us, are animals driven towards destruction.According to Freud, these aggressive destructive drives are “part of man’sanimal nature.” The purpose of society, according to Freud, is to:> > … regulate and control through various forms of coercion the outbursts of> > this innate bestiality against which the human mind is ultimately powerless.Freud’s principal point was that:> > …masses of people can be organized around appeals to the emotions. The most> > powerful such appeals are to the unconscious, which has the power to> > dominate and throw aside reason.Therefore, the key to mass brainwashing is to create an organized, controlledenvironment in which:> > … stress and tension can be applied to break down morally informed judgment,> > thereby making an individual more susceptible to suggestion.28And that was before the advent of Social Media, which renders all of the abovementioned systems obsolete. Remember: giant multinational media groups controlnot only television networks and your local newspapers and radio stations butalso every major social media network in the world.Global Media MonopolyAOL-Time Warner controls 292 separate companies and subsidiaries.> > Of these, twenty-two are joint ventures with other major corporations> > involved in varying degrees with media operations.

It also means that a single message– always presented from different angles – can easily saturate all forms ofmedia to generate consent (i.e. “Arabs are terrorists.”).The Thomson Corporation, with its headquarters in Toronto, Canada, owns 105daily and 26 weekly papers in the United States, mostly in smaller markets, notdominated by large city press.The Pearson Group run from London is a $3 billion empire, and is one of the mostpowerful media influences in the British Empire and the world. It owns severalpapers, with its flagship being the City of London’s most important journal, theFinancial Times; it holds half ownership in The Economist magazine.Fox News, part of News Corp, with their daily conservative rallies for couchpotatoes, is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who owns a significant part of the world’smedia, amongst them his flagship publication, the Wall Street Journal and 20thCentury Fox movie studio. Murdoch’s Media Empire has been the main propagandaoutlet for the perpetual war of the neo-cons and the Nazi minions.Reuters News Media operates the largest newswire service in the world, with theworld’s most extensive international private satellite and cable communicationsnetwork. Its news services are produced in 19 languages, with nearly every majornews media outlet in the world taking one or more of its feeds. In addition,Reuters provides packaged coverage to hundreds of thousands of media outletsworldwide, providing features as well as news materials. Reuters Television isthe world’s largest international television news agency, reaching 500 millionhouseholds, through 650 broadcasters in over 80 countries.In the United States, the New York Times and the Washington Post are key mediaorgans of the power elite linked to the Bilderberg Group. The Washington Post,founded by Eugene Meyer is the voice of official Washington, and has alwaysstood for a weak presidency and ultimately a strong Federal Reserve – a privatebanking corporation.The New York Times has the largest newsgathering force in the world and is twiceas big as its nearest competitor. The Times also owns the International HeraldTribune, which is sold in 164 countries, with a daily circulation of severalmillion. The Times has always been a Bilderberg and a British Crown propagandachannel, since Bilderberg’s first meetings in the mid 1950s.Historically, the New York Times, with utterly unwarranted self-assurance,designated itself the arbiter of ‘All the news that’s fit to print.’ The NewYork Times has served the interests of the Rockefeller family in the context ofa long-standing relationship. The current New York Times chairman ArthurSulzberger Jr. is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the son ofArthur Ochs Sulzberger and grandson of Arthur Hays Sulzberger who served as aTrustee for the Rockefeller Foundation. Ethan Bronner, deputy foreign editor ofthe New York Times as well as columnist, Thomas Friedman among many others aremembers of both the Bilderberg Group and Council on Foreign Relations.These media heavyweights do not merely analyze and interpret foreign policy forthe United States; they help make it. Rather than offering an independentperspective on the actions of the politicians, the Establishment media acts asthe ruling elite’s voice – conditioning the public to accept, and even embrace,insider designs that otherwise might not be politically attainable.Another media heavyweight is London’s The Economist.The Economist, mouthpiece for the City of London, started publishing in theheyday of the British East Indian Company in 1843. TheEconomist’s Editor-in-Chief, John Micklethwait was a participant in eight of thelast ten Bilderberg conferences. Adrian Wooldridge, The Economist’s managementeditor is a habitual attendee at annual Bilderberg conferences. Nevertheless,nary a word is found in this prestigious establishment journal about theBilderberg Group.The Economist is jointly owned by Britain’s Rothschild family and Lazard Frèresbanking houses, both close to Britain’s royal family. Lazard is a leading Frenchand British asset of the Anglo-Dutch combine, centered in the Royal Dutch Shell,which is the Dutch and the British Royal families and in the Rothschild bankingorganization. This is the phenomenon today called the Bilderberg Group.Hyppolyte Worms, the founder of Banque Worms, itself a creation of Lazard, was ashipping magnate, whose business was built on its contracts to deliver RoyalDutch Shell oil.30 He was also one of the twelve founding members of theSynarchist Movement of Empires, a secret organization behind the delivery ofFrance to Hitler and the Nazis. Lazard Fréres was the French investment bank forShell, and it was in that capacity that Lazard was instrumental in the creationof the banking arm of the Worms group, Banque Worms et Cie.Even in the age of Internet, blogospheres and other new generation contraptionsof mass dissemination of information, the mass media still sets the tone formost news coverage, defining issues and setting the limits of “respectable”opinion. Journalism itself no longer exists, but rather promtional campaignsnegotiated by PR firms running product advertising campaigns masked as news.Associated Press (AP) is the oldest and largest news agency in the world. On anygiven day, it delivers some 20 million words and thousands of visuals, globally.It also provides a selectable stock service, an array of audio, text andinformation services. It also operates, via satellite, a nationwide radio newsservice for several hundred radio stations – making it one of the largest radionetworks in the United States. AP’s domestic network includes 143 bureaus andover 6,000 radio stations, and, through its international feed, to thousandsmore outlets overseas.Then, there is Corporation for Public Broadcasting, PBS, supposedly is a publicinstitution. “Available to 99 percent of American homes with television, PBSserves nearly 90 million people each week.”31Every one of the aforementioned media groups and companies are members of theBilderberg Group. You would never know it, however, as this information is neverrevealed to the public. The mass media serves as agents of change – the changebeing our inefficient understanding of the world around us.The Fascist Concept of Man> > The Nazi state was created by the same oligarchic financial and political> > interests who today control what we call the mass media and television. At> > the root of this experiment was the desire to create a New World Order based> > on reversing a fundamental premise of western Christian civilization: that> > man is created as a higher and distinct species from animals, created in the> > image of the living God and by Divine grace, imparted the Divine Spark of> > reason.”32What makes man human is our power of reason. The only thing greater than life:the power of the human mind. This is how mankind is measured. What separates usfrom animals is our ability to discover universal physical principles. It allowsus to innovate, which subsequently improves the lives of people. Development ofmankind, the development of the power of the individual and the nation dependsupon scientific developments, upon seeking and discovering the Truth as ourhighest goal, thus perfecting our existence. Truth always lies in the higherorder of processes. True sovereignty lies not in popular opinion, but in thecreative powers of the individual human mind.It’s a moral problem, and a problem of destiny, every generation must advancebeyond that of the preceding generation. And the hope, that it will happen, thatis what should be on the mind of the person who is dying of old age: Has theirlife meant something, because it laid the foundation for a better life than theyknew?This is a fundamental clash of ideals. Those who measure up to a Renaissanceview of a man versus those who see themselves, by birthright, above other men –who see mankind as an animal, whose worst impulses must be repressed by thestate. This is a view from the Enlightenment movement, and in its extreme form,the fascist state. To have mass brainwashing work it must attack the Renaissanceview of man, for no person seeking Truth, especially with a strong moralcompass, can be brainwashed.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 How to Profile the Terrorist, EIR, Volume 5, number 37, September 26, 1978.2 Ibid.3 Lonnie Wolfe, Turn off your TV, New Federalist, p.34, 1997.4 Edward Bernays, Propaganda, 1928, reprint, Ig Publshing, 2004.5 Harley Schlanger, Who owns your culture?, Fidelio, Vol. XII, No. I Summer2003.6 Ibid.7 Lyndon LaRouche, Star Wars and Littleton, June 11, 1999, EIR.8 John Chancellor with Walter R.

It seems like this doesn’t have any realconsequence; but let’s imagine the opposite. Let’s imagine the world is finite.Then we have to admit right away that the resources available are also finite,as well as the territory to be shared.”1 As human population grows, mankind ismaking an ever increasing impact on the environment – colonizing its land,consuming its resources, and releasing huge quantities of waste into its seasand atmosphere.Now, let’s extrapolate that finite existence into the future, to the very end, ageneration or two from now. Imagine the wreckage and now, let’s piece ittogether. What on Earth happened to us?Ours was the greatest civilization in history, so advanced and powerful, itdwarfed anything that came before it, but like other great societies, it did notlast. To have lived, and then to have died is not to be absent but to becomeabsent; to be someone and then go away – leaving traces. How could thecivilization that had mastered the planet, suddenly collapse?We are back in the year 2015. Decay is rampant and unavoidable. Businesses arefailing, and companies that remain in business face shortages and delays. Peoplerespond with a helpless sense of doom. The anxiety leaves one gasping forbreath, and represents a declaration of defenselessness before a force tooterrifying and massive to combat or even comprehend – a pervasive hopelessnessand loss of spirit.Great cities lay abandoned, incredible feats of engineering left to ruin. Acollapse that caused the greatest disaster in human history – our ownextinction.If you are trying to assembly a multi-dimensional case, to understand what kindof a force drives events: a collapse of civilization, happening it seems withthe precise stroke of a diamond cutter’s knife – a pogrom of demand destructiondesigned to reduce the world’s population in order to preserve for the elite theever diminishing natural resources. This single piece of the puzzle was whatstarted to make everything else resonate and make sense of the hidden dynamicsWe know what a collapse looks like: Budapest’s cobbled streets – a war zone.Protesters armed with blocks of ice, caught on film smashing up Hungary’sfinance ministry. Thousands trying to force their way into the legislature.This is real. In the year 2015, the economic collapse is hitting hard in everyindustrialized country in the world. Around the world, emerging financialmarkets are imploding at a speed of light. The meltdown has hit turbo charge inEurope as a result of a three-week old lack of Russian natural gas.Triggered by the economic collapse and compounded by human suffering inunheated, near-zero weather, riots have erupted from Latvia in the North, toSofia in the South. Around the world, from China, to India, to Europe,industrialized nations are frantically preparing for civil unrest. This is notsome piece of fiction. This is not Atlas Shrugged. This is about now. It affectsall of humanity.Another image: Ordinary people enraged by austerity cuts and draconian wagedeflation, their hard earned savings reduced to nothing under forced governmentdevaluation, fighting for their own survival. Civil unrest now moves from theback to the front burner. Political leaders and opposition groups from as faraway as South Korea and Turkey, Philippines, Hungary, Germany, Austria, France,Mexico and Canada are calling for the dissolution of national parliaments.This is madness, but it is real. It is all around us. We see it on daily basison television, read about it in the press, and see it with our own eyes.The European Monetary Union has left half of Europe trapped in a depression.Bond markets in the Mediterranean region are at all time lows. S&P hasdowngraded Greek debt to junk and the country’s social fabric is unraveling asthe pain begins.The Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and Irish governments are balking at payingtheir short-term debt, putting at risk the solvency of the world’s financialsystem. Cyprus is being bailed out, its citizens prohibited from withdrawing itssavings in a desperate effort by the European Union to stave off collapse.A great ring of EU states stretching from Eastern Europe down across MareNostrum to the Celtic fringe are either in a 1930’s depression already or soonwill be. Each state is a victim of ill-advised economic policies foisted uponthem by elites committed to Europe’s monetary project – either in the EuropeanMonetary Union or preparing to join – the states are trapped.However, the economic aspect of it is just one area. This is as much aboutgeography as it is about politics. A new order is being created where geographyand money are proving to be the ultimate trump cards: geography becomes thegoverning economic decision-making factor.Geography is giving us our first major political tectonic fault line. From theBaltic south, through Greece, into Turkey, then fanning out across the MiddleEast. This is the new frontier of soon-to-be flaming unrest.A snake eating its own tail for nutrition. It is the way money works … for now.Is there a chance, under present circumstances for governments to join forcesand save the world from oblivion? A Snowball’s chance in hell! The scope of thecrisis, as we are discovering, is simply beyond one’s comprehension. Ourcollective impotence to address an entirely new conceptual set ofnation-threatening issues runs the risk of being seen for what it is – trying tofix the unfixable.How much time do we have? Three months, six months, one year tops. Then what?Whatever is coming beyond that time frame is coming at us as we speak. We maynot have the luxury of an organized retreat. The system is broken. And it cannotbe corrected while an unprecedented “elite-controlled” economic collapse issmashing down every wall between humanity and the unthinkable.Knives are coming out and points of no return are fast approaching. If oursituation goes much further we will soon know whether the United States and therest of the world lives or dies. Moreover, we will know whether a civilizedsociety is an option or an untenable dream. If it is not, then the barbarians atthe gates will come, and they will bring with them mighty appetites.First stage: Systemic breakdown that will cripple the economy. The world economycomes to a screeching halt. No welfare checks, no Social Security, no healthcarebenefits, no food stamps for the poor and no money to pay the millions ofgovernment employees.Panics would, within a few days, drive prices significantly skyward. And assupplies no longer meet demand, the market will become paralyzed by prices toohigh for the wheels of commerce and even daily living. The trucks will no longerpull into food stores.Hoarding and uncertainty would trigger outages, violence and chaos. Police andmilitary will be able to maintain order for only a short time, if at all.The damage that several days’ shortage and outage will do, could soon wreakpermanent damage that starts with companies and consumers not paying their billsand employees not going to work. This would be the second stage.The poor will be the first to suffer and they will suffer the most. They will bethe first to die. Death of hundreds of millions. That’s the final stage. It isvery hard and very painful to get one’s mind to accept this reality but MotherNature does not grant time outs.The problem is, humanity has no Plan B and it is now also too late to come upwith a Plan C or Plan D. Progress is what brings light out of darkness,civilization out of disorder, prosperity out of poverty. All of these essentialsare being challenged and threatened.Wars, famine, disease, droughts, social unrest, depleting natural resources. Howoften have we chased the dream of progress only to see that dream perverted?Technology offers us strength, strength enables dominance, and dominance pavesthe way for abuse.Technological advancements are not the end of the world, but merely seeds forchange, and change never comes without pain. It’s in our nature to want to riseabove our limits. Every time we have met an obstacle, we’ve used creativity andingenuity to overcome it. And isn’t achieving a dream, worth it?Society needs laws and regulations to protect it. And if the elite need to workin the shadows, pulling strings to enable us to head in a safe direction, wouldsupporting them be all that bad?We are at a zero hour, facing our own demise as humanity. What does death looklike from the other side? People die at least twice. Once physically, oncenotionally; when the heart stops and when forgetting begins. The lucky ones, thegreat ones, are those whose second death is decently, perhaps indefinitelypostponed.Does death reveal that there has been no life, only a dream of life. And willthe new Man, the one that comes after our society disappeared, remember us as wewere, or think of us as victims of happenstance?Time and space – the pile of debris we call history; also represents oursuccesses. And we have had successes. Will they be sustained or will they vanishlike time?A thin pearl of light from the fading moon plunges into the angry swells of thedark, furious ocean; the white sprays are caught in a night sky rolled over thechiseled rock under the force of the night wind. And we are back in 2015 – atzero hour. Depleting natural resources and the ever-expanding population basehas made it mission urgent to discover alternative energy sources.Behind closed doors, in the shadows, the elite and their concubines arescheming, conspiring and working on secret survival plans for their own future.Natural resources are the corner stone of their plans. The Earth has beendepleted, raped and devoured by the greed of men. Now, what if the greatestdiscovery of natural resources didn’t take place on Earth? And if not on Earth,then where?We have nearly devoured Planet Earth. The next challenge, before it is too late,is the heavens and space exploration. Who will get there first?

How will mankind get to the Moon and then to Mars?Well, we’re not going to do it all at once. To get to Mars from Earth’s orbit,we first need to get to the Moon. Once we get to the Moon, the first thing weneed to do, is:> > Build a manufacturing facility on the Moon, which utilizes the raw materials> > on the Moon itself to develop the elements of materials and devices that you> > can ship to further destinations, such as Mars.5And once built:> > Getting even massive components off the Moon’s surface is far easier than it> > would be from Earth due to lower gravity and lack of air (it took a> > tremendous Saturn V rocket full of fuel to get to the Moon, but only the> > tiny Apollo ascent module to get back off).

Water from asteroids can fuel an in-spaceeconomy.Dr. Gerald Kulcinski told a lunar science conference in September 1986:> > … the Moon has a decisive advantage relative to the Earth, in the> > purification of those metals, which are always found in raw minerals that> > contain a lot of oxygen.

Are you surprised at the question? Youshouldn’t be.As we speak, plans are being drawn up by the European Space Agency and Russiafor a joint mission to Mars. Privately funded corporations such as PlanetaryResources and Golden Spike Company are working around the clock on a landingmission to the Moon and the mission-critical projects of asteroid mining.A private space venture from the Netherlands called “Mars One,” aims to sendfour astronauts on a one-way journey to Mars in an experimental colony by theyear 2023.The British government’s top secret Strategic Trends Report makes the intentionsof the elite crystal clear. By the year 2050:> > We are going to power ships that go in significant numbers with people in> > them, to Mars.That’s right, the elite are planning, at least, a limited exodus from the PlanetEarth. Why? What do they know that we don’t? Nuclear wars? Nanowars?Bacteriological wars? They would know. They are organized to operate over andabove society.What is known, according to a 20-year-old declassified NASA report, is thefollowing.Phase 1: Helium-3 MiningBetween now and the year 2020, a manned space station will have small vehiclesparked outside that can go back and forth to the Moon. Their purpose? Helium-3mining.

A newparadigm for resource discovery. Private sector human expeditions to the Moonare now feasible, primarily using existing space systems or those indevelopment, trying to bring the solar system into humanity’s sphere ofinfluence.> > The Golden Spike Company is working to implement and operate a human space> > transportation system at commercially successful price points.12Circling the Sun between Mars and Jupiter are near-limitless numbers ofasteroids, chunks of rock ranging in size from footballs to gigantic Ceres,1,000 km (620 miles) across.> > More than 1,500 are as easy to reach as the Moon and are in similar orbits> > as Earth.

Water’selements, hydrogen and oxygen, can also be used to formulate rocket fuel.

The Curiosity mission to Mars has incorporatedinto its roving vehicle: robots, lasers, chemical products, the best technologythere is.Communication technologies are trillions of times more powerful than they were acentury ago, when we were sending Morse code over AM radio frequencies, forexample. If you follow the inevitable trajectory of ongoing progress at anexponential pace, we get to a point where we may merge with this technology andgreatly expand our own intelligence.If we can apply these technological developments on Mars, we could also applythem to the civilian economy on Earth. And as we have seen with the Apolloproject, the technological revolution related to space missions produce greatbenefits: Teflon, computer chips, robotic self-driving cars that build instantthree-dimensional LIDAR scans of their surroundings and telerobotics.For example, modern surgeons can now operate on a patient from across a room andofficers in the Pentagon order a drone kill from across the world.Technological development for mankind is a very big part of space exploration.Technologies are invented to make our lives easier, not our choices. The problemcomes, when we forget that.> > The main way that telerobotics differs from current robotic exploration,> > such as that done by Curiosity and other rovers> > [index_split_014.html#filepos655139], is that it places human cognition> > right where the action is.

In addition to saving money, it keeps humans out of harm’s way.18Pentagon’s science division, DARPA agrees. For nearly 50 years, the DefenseAdvanced Research Projects Agency:> > … has engineered technological breakthroughs from the Internet to stealth> > jets.

These are the direct derivatives of space age technology. Accordingto the DARPA’s 2013 budget:> > The Avatar program will develop interfaces and algorithms to enable a> > soldier to effectively partner with a semi-autonomous bi-pedal machine and> > allow it to act as the soldier’s surrogate.> > The rise of the machines is here.

All of these projects are a direct result of space ageexploration technologies.A controller could monitor a pilot’s brain with functional near infraredspectroscopy. Another project being funded concerns less sleep. In this project,psychologists are using transcranial magnetic stimulation to counter fatigue.Other projects include stronger exoskeletons and tougher bodies.> > All sort of new techniques from pharmaceuticals to robotics exoskeletons> > make this vision come true.

What will they become?Will they be more than human or less? There is technology, there is strength.The temptation to misuse it is hard to resist. Will our soldiers be strongenough to stay human? Silence. Deathly silence.Moth CyborgHowever, DARPA’s vanguard projects are not based only on their research intosuper soldiers. The agency is working hard to establish an array of cyberneticinsects. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is implanting computerchips in moths while still in the pupa stage for use in surveillance. The mothgrows around the chip and then its nervous system may be controlled by a remotecontrol.The program, the ‘Hybrid Insect Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems’ (HI-MEMS) ispart of their Controlled Biological and Biomimetic Systems program and seeks to:> > … fuse mechanical micro-technologies to living insects creating a> > machine-bug amalgam.23It also includes outfitting other insects with miniscule sensors, cameras and awireless transmitter attached to their very nervous system that can becontrolled remotely like RC airplanes and could send data from placesinaccessible to humans.> > The microsystems that DARPA calls payloads will draw parasitic power from> > the insects, work with the insect’s nerve or muscles, and take control of> > the insect.24As Fox News reports,> > It is hoped that one day, a sensor-enabled insect with a 100-yard range> > could be placed within five meters of a target using electronic remote> > control and, potentially, Global Positioning System technologies.> > Ultimately, the moth will be able to land in enemy camps in remote location> > unobserved, beaming video and other information back via what its developers> > refer to as a ‘reliable tissue-machine interface.’> > This latest development will allow the moth cyborgs to spy on enemy> > insurgents, and is the most advanced robotic technology ever conceived by> > DARPA.”25The remote-controlled moths are just part of its overall research intomicroelectromechanical systems, were one of a number of technologies soon to bedeployed in combat zones.> > The Department of Defense has said it wants one-third of all missions to be> > unmanned by 2015, and there’s no doubt their things will become weaponized,> > so the question comes: Should they be given targeting authority?> > Biological engineering is coming.

Think of computers, chemistry andmaterial science. Computers have brought us to nano-electronics. Billions ofnano components on a scale of 10s of nano meters. Material science has broughtnano-scale structures. Chemistry has led to increasingly advanced and atomicallyprecise molecular structures.“Nano” is space measured between one atom and about 400 atoms. It is a space inwhich quantum behavior begins to replace the Newtonian physics. There is enoughroom for billions of small molecules. Molecules are well defined – preciselydefined chemical entities. Nano particles are almost always different.They have the gradations in size. Their surfaces are different in detailedtextures, their compositions vary. They are not distinct entities, but a part ofa continuum. Furthermore, the surfaces are modified by environmental exposure.In the body, proteins stick to them. In nature, they can be chemically modifiedin various ways.What are possibilities in terms of physical laws? In any direction, if you gofar enough, you hit limits set by physical law. Quantum mechanics, speed oflight, gravitational forces, etc.Now, think of the Earth on a new scale, a billionth of a meter. The distancebetween the moon and the earth is on the order of a billion meters, a day’stravel. The distance between a meter and a billionth of a meter, is roughly thesame gulf, but takes a few seconds.We are heading deep into the world of nano-science, down to the dimension of anatom. To put in context: a strand of DNA is 2.5nm wide; a protein molecule is5nm, a red blood cell 7,000 nm.Compared to the human hair, a nanometer is 100,000 times smaller than yourstrand of hair. At a nano-meter scale, everyday materials start to act inunimaginable ways. The behavior of nano materials can change when the sizebecomes so small as compared with a larger amount of that same material.As these technologies come together, what we will be seeing is atomicallyprecise nano-systems, small scale by microscopic standards, but large scale bythe previous standards of atomically precise systems.These nano-technologies have wide industrial use today. In medicine, they arebeing used to put functional structures into the body, whereby part of ittargets the cancer cell and part of it contributes to destroying it.> > Nanotechnology embodies the dream that scientists can remake the world from> > the atom up, using atomic level manipulation to transform and construct a> > wide range of new materials, devices, living organisms and technological> > systems.29The economic, military and everyday consequences would be immense. First of all,we can see increasing miniaturization of components in the electronic ornanoelectronic industry. The storing in tiny volumes of space far moreprocessing power than is currently possible, but also making use of biomedicalapplications: an artificial retina, replacing an ear that no longer works, beingable to make molecular wires, like a nerve which could create all sorts ofimpulses that the brain would decode.With the advent of new science and technology related to the genetic revolution,we can literally rewrite our genetic construct. In a span of a generation, wehave gone from genetically modified plants, to genetically modified animals. Isthe next step genetically modified humans?In fact, genetic engineering and nanotechnological military applications are thenext arms race.MetamaterialsOur mastery over properties of matter is massively opening up our horizons. Forexample:> > … nano structured photonic materials represent a paradigm shift in> > technology, and the beginning of a new photonic revolution. The industrial> > revolution changed the fabric of society, the optical light. An optical> > fibers carrying light created global information networks. Photonic> > metamaterials will bring the next revolution, providing smarter solutions> > for all industries where light is used: from telecommunication and data> > storage to defense security.30In 2010, scientists created a material that should not exist in nature. Whenlight hits an object, it is the object’s atomic structure that determines whatwe see.Whether it is translucent marble, clear water or green leaves. It all depends onhow the light interacts with the atoms. If we can manipulate those atoms, wecould ultimately control what the world looks like. How? By creating artificialmaterials called metamaterials.> > And these new structures outperform nature in quite startling ways. And they> > do so at incredibly small scales. Nanophotonic metamaterials provide a> > degree of control over light that was unimaginable even a few years ago.31The first applications are obviously for military stealth. One direct derivativeof the metamaterial that we couldn’t imagine, just a few years ago, is aninvisibility cloak. It doesn’t exist in nature.The retro-reflective-projection technology for an invisibility cloak wasdeveloped by a Japanese team at Keio University in 2003.> > What makes the technology unique is a fabric made of glass beads only 50> > microns wide which can reflect light directly back to the source much like> > the movie screen. The material can be applied to almost anything. The goal> > is to create augmented reality, which allows anyone to easily see> > information on real world objects.”32In military applications, this invisibility cloak,33 a sheet of hexagonal pixelscalled AdaptiV, helps military vehicles blend into their surroundings and avoidheat-seeking missiles because the metamaterial deflects the light in a way thatlight flows around a hidden object with no discernible distortion.> > The light you and I see with our eyes is just a small range of frequencies> > on a much larger spectrum called the electromagnetic spectrum.

You sell guns that kill people, andkilling people, you reduce their numbers. Population reduction. This is awin-win proposition as far as the elite are concerned.An increasing number of people in the world mean a greater potential to causetrouble, and to demand a bigger slice of the “Big Pie of Life.” The authors ofthe Strategic Trends Report 2007-2036 devote a lot of space to Global Pandemics.According to the report:> > A new untreatable virus that spreads rapidly among human populations,> > causing serious illness, would pose a significant threat to societies, which> > are both increasingly concentrated in urban settlements and also connected> > by modern mass-transit systems. Such an illness would be extremely difficult> > to contain and could have catastrophic impacts beyond its immediate medical> > effects, possibly including the collapse of the highly integrated global> > economy, with its complex networks of interdependent relationships. Similar> > effects might be induced by the rapid spread of disease among livestock or> > crops.37Too far-fetched? For example, In-Q-Tel, CIA’s non-profit venture capital firm isspending some of its money on two areas of biotechnology: Nano-biologyconvergence and physiological intelligence. The company is interested in:> > … human genetic and biochemical response to disease or environmental> > exposure to chemicals or organisms.Another company interested in human genetic and biochemical response is BioRadLaboratories in California. They make one of the most hazardous biological andnuclear chemical compounds known to man. It would have been Hitler’s wet dream.The chemical compound is selective to the degree, in that with an appropriategenetic material, you could wipe out whole segments of humanity. It is racespecific.In-Q-Tel and BioRad Laboratories are both closely related to the US intelligenceapparatus. Does anyone in his or her right mind believe this to be acoincidence? And these viruses, not necessarily need to be simple bio-viruses.They could be nano-viruses, which are a great deal more deadly.Nanointelligence and NanoweaponsNanobots were created to be like life. To be able to reproduce and to serve ourneeds. The intelligence of nanotech will not be in one nanobot. It will be acollective intelligence of trillions of nanobots working together and poolingtheir thinking resources.Dr. John Alexander, adviser to US special operations, said,> > You can program nanobots specifically so that they attack only people with> > certain characteristics.They can be sent out to take out people in the most secure locations. Onceprogrammed, nothing would stop them. But can we control them? The fear is thatto breed, they will need organic material – which is everywhere. This means,they may reproduce themselves. And as their numbers increase, they can turn onthe environment around them – as they begin to take on the life of their own.These nano weapons attack a target at the molecular level, and then use themolecules of their target as raw materials to replicate more copies ofthemselves. In this way, small amounts of these replicators could have thecapacity to destroy large targets very quickly. They could devour plants,animals, and ultimately, people. This is how wars may be fought in the future.Can this be our future? A world transformed … by good or evil?Do you remember what I said at the beginning of the chapter? Ours was thegreatest civilization in history, so advanced and powerful, it dwarfed anythingthat came before it, but like other great societies, it did not last. Greatcities lay abandoned, incredible feats of engineering left to ruin. A collapsethat caused the greatest disaster in human history – our own extinction. Couldnanotechnology be harnessed to do this?Nanotech Weaponry – Modus Operandi> > Molecular manufacturing raises the possibility of horrifically effective> > weapons.

Embeddedcomputers would allow remote activation of any weapon, and more compact powerhandling would allow greatly improved robotics.

Ultimately, the terrifying power of nano-based weapons could maketotal annihilation of a state’s population more possible.And as Strategic Trends 2007-2036 Report makes abjectly clear,> > …it may enable many nations to be globally destructive, eliminate the> > ability of powerful nations to police the international arena. By making> > small groups self-sufficient, it can encourage the breakup of existing> > nations.”The geopolitical predictions of the Strategic Trends Reports are no lessterrifying: “The exponential growth of molecular nanotechnology (MNT) woulddestroy the economy, job markets, and much more. The black market wouldflourish, and countries would break away from alliances under the new power ofMNT. The UN would also cease to have any control over international problems.All of these things would be happening while inevitably waiting fornano-machines to create a doomsday scenario. This scenario is known as anecophagy (the consumption of an en ecosystem). Imagine a world whereself-replicating nano robots consume all matter on earth while exponentiallyduplicating.”42Are the elite playing with fire? Is this part of a long-range plan of demanddestruction in order to destroy the world’s economy on purpose? If it is, theybetter be careful of what they wish for.Do you remember how the “snooping” all started? High tech went from rummagingthrough your garbage to telephone bugging, and then expanded to TotalInformation Awareness and Data Mining before going really high tech into PROMIS,nanotechnology and a whole slew of space-age extensions.Total Information AwarenessShortly after September 11, 2001, the US Department of Defense proposed aprogram it called Total Information Awareness (TIA), which would have involvedthe creation of a huge database containing a substantial collection of privateinformation about every American citizen – all with the objective of catching“terrorists” before they commit the crime.As in Spielberg’s Minority Report, fiction mirrors reality.The data would come from all the electronic tracks we leave behind: financial,housing, education, travel, medical, veterinary, transportation, andcommunication. At the time, there was an immediate resounding protest across theUnited States against the program and its violation of civil liberties.Using the Orwellian tactics of double-speak, the Pentagon briefly changed thename of the program to Terrorism Information Awareness. But then under pressurefrom American libertarian groups, US Congress took action to prohibit fundingfor TIA, and the man who championed the project – a convicted felon involved inthe Iran-Contra, Reagan-era arms smuggling, retired Admiral John Poindexterresigned.The new updated, scrubbed, refreshed and made over version of Pentagon’sdiscredited Total Information Awareness is your good, old Data Mining to the nthdegree: the gradual dissolution of our individual freedoms in favor of a mammothspy system that is representative of a larger trend that has been underway inthe United States and in Europe – the seemingly inexorable drift toward asurveillance society.In other word, with today’s technology, every person and every one of theiractions become visible on the world grid, 24/7. Yet, with this erosion ofpeople’s Constitutional rights, not a whimper is heard from the beaten down,demoralized, subjugated populace.UK’s Department of Defense defines it as having:> > … complete control of everyone’s actions at all time.This is but a tip of the proverbial iceberg.PROMISWhat would you do if you possessed software that could think, understand everylanguage in the world, provided peep holes into the innermost secret chambers ofeveryone else’s computers, that could insert data into computers withoutpeople’s knowledge, enter via the back door of secret bank accounts and thenremove the money without leaving a trace; that could fill in blanks beyond humanreasoning and also predict what people would do – long before they did it,within a one percent margin of error? You would probably use it, wouldn’t you?Welcome to the world of PROMIS – Prosecutor’s Management Information System.PROMIS is many things to many people. Think of a painting. To the scientist, asnowflake is a snowflake; to an artist, it may be an intricate pattern or anassemblage of minute curved surfaces. On the surface, PROMIS is a product. Butit is also something more important and more personal, namely the artist’sattitude to the invisible world in general; a question of an attitude of themind.It was originally designed to track cases through the legislative, judicial andexecutive branches by integrating computers of dozens of US Attorneys’ officesaround the country. The more data you entered, the more accurately the systemcould analyze and predict the final outcome of the cases.All information on someone is fed into the software – educational, military,criminal, professional background, credit history, basically anything you canget your hands on, then the software is tasked with making an assessment, andfinally rendering a conclusion based on the available information. The moreinformation available, the better the software will predict the outcome.PROMIS can literally predict human behavior based on information from people.The government and the spooks immediately recognized the financial and militaryapplication of PROMIS, especially the National Security Agency, which hadmillions of bits of intelligence coming into its facilities every day, and withonly an antiquated Cray Supercomputer Network to log it, sort it, and analyzeit.In other words, whoever owned PROMIS, once it was fused with artificialintelligence, could accurately predict commodities futures, real estate, or eventhe movement of entire armies on a battlefield, not to mention every country’spurchasing habits, drug habits, stereotypes, and psychological tendencies, inreal time –based upon the information fed into it.The program crossed a threshold in the evolution of computer programming. Aquantum leap, if you like. Think of block-modeling social research theory. Itdescribes the same unique vantage point from hypothetical and real lifeperspectives. For example, pick an actual physical point in space. Now, in yourmind, move it further out than you ever thought possible. PROMIS progeny havemade possible the positioning of satellites so far out in space that they areuntouchable. The ultimate big picture.There is another advantage: geomatics. The term applies to a related group ofsciences – all involving satellite imagery – used to develop geographicinformation systems, global positioning systems and remote sensing from space.Imaging that can actually determine the locations of natural resources such asoil, precious metals and other commodities.By providing client nations PROMIS-based software it could then be possible tocompile a global database of every marketable natural resource. And it would notbe necessary to even touch the resources because commodities and futures marketsexist for all of them. An A.I.-enhanced, PROMIS- based program could then be theperfect set up to make billions of dollars in profits by watching andmanipulating the world’s political climate.Subsequent research has clearly demonstrated that a similar remote hypotheticalposition could eliminate randomness from all human activity. Everything would bevisible in terms of measurable and predictable patterns. Again, the ultimate bigpicture.The other thing to remember is that where mathematics has proved that everyhuman being on the earth is connected to every other by only six degrees ofseparation, in undercover operations the number shrinks to around three. In thePROMIS arena it often shrinks to two.PROMIS is not a virus. It has to be installed as a program on the computersystems that you want to penetrate. That’s where an Elbit Flash memory chipcomes in.PROMIS maybe fitted with an Elbit Flash memory chip that activates power to thecomputer when it is turned off. That’s because Elbit chips work on ambientelectricity in a computer. When combined with another newly developed chip, thePetrie, which is capable of storing up to six months worth of key strokes, it isnow possible to burst transmit all of a computer’s activity in the middle of thenight to a nearby receiver – say in a passing truck or even in a low-flyingSignals Intelligence satellite.There is something else about PROMIS you should know: the trap door. The trapdoor allows access to the information stored within any database by anyone whoknows the correct access code. Sovereign nation’s intelligence and bankingrecords can accessed through the Trojan trap door allowing unrestricted access.Which helps ensure the survival of the US hegemony abroad and at home.Sold to foreign governments, the PROMIS A.I. software could later be accessed bythe United States government without other government’s knowledge – from theshadowsA goal would be to penetrate every banking system in the world. The elite couldthen use PROMIS both to predict and to influence the movement of financialmarkets worldwide.However, in order to capture each market you would have to control, own orinfluence each country’s Intelligence, Armed Forces, and bank.But why would one need to go through all the trouble of monitoring all of aforeign country’s intelligence operations and military? There’s an easier way toget what you want. Fit PROMIS with a Trojan door version on every computer yousell to Canada, Europe and Asia, both civilian and government, to monitor theirmilitary, banking and intelligence operations.This places all data at constant risk of exposure. What makes the whole thinkspectacular is that many governments are not aware of what they have gottenthemselves into. Even if they were, there is little they can do about it at thisstage in the game. These are mission-critical systems requiring years ofdevelopment, not something you whip up in a jiffy at a hot dog stand. Forcingevery nation on Earth into cooperating with whoever has the system could easilybe done once PROMIS software is on line because software would “control”national banks, intelligence agencies and military.By cornering, via unlimited access, banking, intelligence and the military – themere threat of force is all that is needed. A weapon is only good if someoneknows what it’s capability is. Prior to using the atomic bomb – it wasirrelevant.Governments have been provided with modified PROMIS software that each one ofthese nations then modified, or thought they modified, again to eliminate thetrap door. But unknown to all of them, the Elbit chips in the systems bypassedthe trap doors and permitted the transmission of data when everyone thought thecomputers were turned off and secure. This is how you can cripple everythingthat Canada, Europe and Asia do that you don’t like.Please understand again, that the good old days of government officials lookingthrough your garbage for clues to your behavior are long gone.Today, space has become the final frontier.For example, NASA’s unmanned Global Hawk research aircraft developed by NorthropGrumman Corporation flies up to 20,000 meters and provides the longestcontinuous observation of a tropical cyclone development ever recorded by anaircraft. The images are captured by Ames Research Center’s HDVis camera. Thehurricane surveillance mission is part of the Genesis and Rapid IntensificationProcess (GRIP) experiment, a NASA Earth science field experiment to betterunderstand how tropical storms form and develop into major hurricanes.The Global Hawk’s science instruments have the capability to peer through cloudtops and measure the internal structure of a storm. The hurricane missions willoffer new insights into the fundamental questions of hurricane genesis andintensification.43But, again, it is mission specific and these missions can change and be adjustedto military missions depending on the needs of NASA and by extension, the UnitedStates government. That’s not all.Boeing has launched the next generation Global Positioning System (GPS) IIF-1satellite, the inaugural spacecraft in a 12-satellite constellation that thecompany is building for the US Air Force.> > GPS is the US Department of Defense’s largest satellite constellation, with> > 30 spacecraft on orbit. The GPS IIF satellites will provide more precise and> > powerful signals, a longer design life, and many other benefits to nearly 1> > billion civilian and military users worldwide.44Raytheon is developing advanced control segment (OCX), which will dramaticallyaffect GPS command, control and mission capabilities and make it easier for theoperations team to run the current GPS block II and all future GPS satellites.Raytheon has over forty years of experience in command and control systems forsatellites. Other partners in the project include The Boeing Company, ITT,Braxton Technologies, Infinity Systems Engineering and the Jet PropulsionLaboratory and DARPA.The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California manages all of the planetaryprograms for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), includingways to make use of laser technology to communicate with spacecraft that arebillions of miles away.A key partner in all these technological military projects is Defense AdvancedResearch Projects Agency [DARPA]. So, what is DARPA?According to the DARPA’s own web page, it’s mission:> > … is to maintain the technological superiority of the US military and> > prevent technological surprise from harming our national security by> > sponsoring revolutionary, high-payoff research bridging the gap between> > fundamental discoveries and their military use.45However, delving deeper, we find DARPA involved in development of a frighteningtechnology with horrific implications. An August 5, 2003 Boston Globe storyspecifically discussed: “Defense Department funding brain-machine work.” In itthe writer states,> > It does not take much imagination to see in this the makings of a> > “Matrix”-like cyberpunk dystopia: chips that impose false memories, machines> > that scan for wayward thoughts, cognitively augmented government security> > forces that impose a ruthless order on a recalcitrant population.Back in the 1950s:> > DARPA was the dominant sponsor of computer-related research. Cold War-driven> > projects like SAGE (Semi Automatic Ground Environment), an automated> > air-defense network of unmanned jet planes, led to a growing interest in war> > gaming and command systems studies.46Behavioral psychologists like J.C.R. Licklider hoped that:> > … in not too many years, human brains and computing machines will be coupled> > together very tightly, and that the resulting partnership will think as no> > human brain has ever thought and process data in a way not approached by the> > information-handling machines we know today.“That hope would take form in such later projects as DARPA’s Augmented Cognition(Aug-Cog) to create soldier-computer ‘dyads,’ and the movement for a ‘Post-HumanRenaissance,’ where “there are no demarcations between bodily existence andcomputer simulation, between cybernetic mechanism and biological organism.”47This would become the Holy Grail of the front-end research that has spun off notonly future battlefield technologies, but also much of today’s video gameindustry.”48A 2007 article titled “Video Games and the Wars of the Future” explains thisphenomenon in no uncertain terms:> > A 1997 report entitled ‘Modeling and Simulation: Linking Entertainment and> > Defense,’ summarized the proceedings of a National Research Council> > conference which brought together representatives from the military and> > entertainment world.

The AWARE program will> > solve the current fundamental scaling limitations in imaging systems and> > demonstrate a design methodology for building compact systems, capable of> > forming images at or near the full diffraction-limited instantaneous field> > of view (iFOV) achieved over a wide FOV.50This approach represents a dramatic advance over the current state of technologyand allows the government virtual control over every moving object on the faceof the Earth. The United States government calls this “Full Spectrum Dominance.”Please take a minute and think about the implications.What’s more, DARPA has recently successfully tested gigapixel glass camera with1.4 and 0.96 gigapixel resolution enabling extremely high resolution shots withsmaller system volume and less distortion.51These secret programs, from developing techniques to overcome fundamental limitsin current camera scaling, field of view (FOV), pixels and wavelengths continuesto advance military imaging across the infrared spectrum. According to DARPA’spress release:> > Solutions to these limitations will enable high resolution, large FOV,> > multi-band, and broadband multifunctional camera technologies to enable> > detection, recognition and identification of targets at longer standoff> > distances and improve situational awareness.52In November 2012, DARPA unveiled its cutting edge, state of the art, SpaceSurveillance Telescope, allegedly to: “track and catalogues space debris.”53Able to search an area in space the size of the United States in seconds, SST:> > … is capable of detecting a small laser pointer on top of New York City’s> > Empire State Building from a distance equal to Miami, Florida.54SST data will be fed into the Space Surveillance Network, a US Air Force programcharged with cataloging and observing space objects. The SSN is a worldwidenetwork of 29 space surveillance sensors, including radar and opticaltelescopes, both military and civilian.This information will be used with revolutionary new technology with farreaching military and civilian implications called augmented reality.Augmented RealityAugmented Reality is the melting of the real world with the computer-generatedimagery. In other words, elements, augmented by computer-generated sensoryinput, that enrich the user’s perception of the real world.Now, the US Defense Department has ordered special augmented reality contactlenses that create a virtual display superimposed over the normal field ofvision. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) placed an orderwith Innovega for lenses, which work with special glasses to enable the wearerto focus on faraway and close objects at the same time. “The human eye on itsown can only focus on one distance at a time.”55The BBC reports:> > The contact lenses work by allowing the wearer to focus on two things at> > once – both the information projected onto the glasses’ lenses and the more> > distant view that can be seen through them – resulting in superhuman vision.> > They do this by having two different filters. The central part of each lens> > sends light from the HUD towards the middle of the pupil, while the outer> > part sends light from the surrounding environment to the pupil’s rim.56The system works in conjunction with glasses that project an image orinformation onto the lens or a display screen. This project has far reachingmilitary applications for DARPA such as enabling soldiers on the ground to seeimages generated by drones or satellites to complex situational awarenesssystems encompassing features such as friend/foe identification, multiplesensory interfaces, location intelligence and interactive battlefield medicalsupport, akin to what Arnold Schwarzenegger’s character wore in the movieTerminator.Can these technologies be converged on the battlefield? How about acommunication network that connects every one of the soldiers and put togetheran ad-hoc, self-healing mesh network? Every soldiers has a one-two Megabit persecond data rate wirelessly, and they will have a six megabit per second rateburst, and because it is ad-hoc self healing, it means all those packets ofvisual information from video, voice or moving maps are going to jump fromsoldier to soldier spread over an 18 kilometer area, tailor-made for urbanwarfare in Mega Cities.Every time a soldier engaged in combat, their data packets would hop from one toanother. The soldier vehicles would have bidirectional amplifiers and antennasin them that could communicate to a command post or an operational center. Inother words, for the first time, soldiers in the tactical operations centercommand post, could see and direct warfare in real time, remotely – almost as avideo gamer.Futuristic TechnologyMulti-technological convergence has seen us through to the “smart phone” and weare now embracing computer vision. Three-D Augmented Reality has become agateway to a virtual universe. It allows us to see elements around us, adding anunlimited number of details to what we already know about the objects: the rich,new environment of virtual world.This new technology can observe a scene and identify the elements within it:people, objects, their history, both past and present. On a simple scale, thereare massive opportunities for everyday consumer use. For example, you couldbrowse for hotels and look at the rooms before making a booking.What ANW (articulated naturality environment) is doing, is to break the barrierthat we have with conventional desktop. Current technology only provides us withthe 20-30% of the actual digital experience, but with ANW we can get 100% of theexperience by embracing that virtual world. ANW opens the door to the virtualuniverse where our mind is the only boundary.So, what can be done with all this technology?DARPA’s Video and Image Retrieval and Analysis Tool (VIRAT) and Persistent StareExploitation and Analysis System (PerSEAS) programs very soon hope to enablebetter real-time combat analysis of huge amounts of data generated from multipletypes of sensors.With VIRAT’s ability to identify and highlight key actions, and PerSEAS’sability to ‘see’ dangerous combinations of actions as activities, analysts willsoon be able to concentrate on more detailed reviews and understanding of thedata.VIRAT is focused on full-motion video, from platforms such as Predator orAerostats, allowing analysts to either monitor a live downlink for specificactions of interest, or search an existing archive for past occurrences. Thesesearches may be conducted using a video clip as the input query.VIRAT finds actions that are short in duration and occur in small geographicareas. PerSEAS focuses on wide-area coverage, such as data from Constant Hawk,Gorgon Stare, ARGUS-IS and other persistent sensors.> > PerSEAS observes multiple actions over a long duration and large geographic> > regions to postulate complex threat activities. Algorithms from VIRAT> > provide some of the underlying capabilities within PerSEAS.57There are a number of trends leading to the pervasiveness of these technologies,including: an expanding global economy, the potentially of far-reachingimprovements in processing power, a greater cultural assimilation and awarenessof technology, and the continued convergence of information and communicationtechnologies (ICT). In turn, according to the Strategic Trends Report:> > ICT will itself be a major engine of growth for the global economy.58So, big business of the future is Big Brother’s all pervasive control. In fact,with greater and greater population unrest, information communicationtechnologies will be the big business. The report agrees:> > It is likely that the majority of the global population will find it> > difficult to ‘turn the outside world off.’59However, a dissociative effect is but one of the aspects of overcomingresistance and changing the established paradigm of society. Listen to TheodoreAdorno of Frankfurt School:> > It seems obvious, that the modification of the potentially fascist structure> > cannot be achieved by psychological means alone. The task is comparable to> > that of eliminating neurosis, or delinquency, or nationalism from the world.> > These are products of the total organization of society and are to be> > changed only as that society is changed.60And what would happen if someone decided to “turn the outside world off” and getoff the grid? The world will come looking for you. The Strategic Trends Reportdoesn’t mince words:> > Techniques for overcoming resistance can be improved and adapted for use> > with groups and even for use on a mass scale.Remember, the two key objectives of the elite are control and populationreduction.Human CattleThe methodology of taming the captive herd hasn’t changed in the past 500 years.In the days of the British Empire, first came gunboats, muskets, and thenVenetian-style diplomacy. Thus, the people are subjected, more or less, in thefashion that one herds wild animals into corral.Then the business of taming the captive herd. Forceful restraint is stillobligatory. Those captives tending to rebelliousness must be detected, andeither eliminated or reduced to a moral condition of stale jello. The flock mustbe bred, to evoke in the cultivated descendants the desired attributes ofmilkiness, meatiness, and docility.In this way, the captive breed is brought into a state of self-government, inwhich the ruling bureaucracy is more savagely elitist than the elite themselves.At that latter point in the dumbing-down process, come the winds-of-change, andthe captives are entrusted with the duties of fettering themselves at night, orwhatever the IMF, the World Bank or the financial markets suggest.With technological progress and general advancement in all areas of science, theworld’s population has surpassed seven billion people. With the Internet, wehave access to knowledge that half-a-century ago was only accessible to only theelite’s highest circles.A restless ever-expanding-population mass, diminishing natural resources,instant access to information, with the controlled media playing anever-diminishing role, are all of a great concern to the elite.We never asked for this. But here we are.The intense cross-pollination between the computer, biotech and quantumrevolutions will bring an unprecedented power to fore in the 21-century. Whatwill the world look like a generation from now?What’s undeniable, the rise of the machine is here. It is all around us. We canno longer ignore it. The augmented man-machine will be faster than us, humans.They will be stronger than us. Certainly, they will last much longer than us.You may think they are the future. But you are wrong. We are. If I had a wish, Iwould wish to be human, to know how it feels, to feel, to hope, to despair, towonder and to love. To know that I am unique through my divine spark of reason.Near future man-machines can achieve immortality by not wearing out. We canachieve immortality simply by doing one great thing … for humanity.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Rudolph Biérent, “Exploring Space: The Optimism Of an Infinite Universe,” EIR,23 March, 2012.2 Helga Zepp LaRouche, “The Next Jump in Evolution: The End of Monetarism,”PAC-TV .3 Ibid.4 “Mining Helium-3 on the Moon for unlimited energy,” EIR Volume 14, Number 30,July 31, 1987.5 “The End of The Obama Administration,” LaRouche webcast, EIR, Feb 5, 2010.6 Phil Plait, “Will we ever…live on the Moon,” June 14, 2012, BBC.7 Rudolph Biérent, “Exploring Space: The Optimism Of an Infinite Universe,” EIR,23 March, 2012.8 “The End of The Obama Administration,” LaRouche webcast, EIR, Feb 5, 2010.9 Rudolph Biérent, “Exploring Space: The Optimism Of an Infinite Universe,” EIR,23 March, 2012.10 “Mining Helium-3 on the Moon for unlimited energy,” EIR Volume 14, Number 30,July 31, 1987).11 “The End of The Obama Administration,” LaRouche webcast, EIR, Feb 5, 2010.12 http://goldenspikecompany.com/.13 http://www.planetaryresources.com/mission/.14 http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120613-will-we-ever-live-on-themoon.15 http://www.planetaryresources.com/mission/.16 http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/11/telerobotic-exploration/all/.17 Dr. Kathie L.

Diplomacy ended on September 11, 2001. The reality andrisks of an open global conflict, or a more clandestine secret war of attritionwere thrust into the immediate and unavoidable focus of a world, which has, forthe most part, chosen not to understand what is at stake.This war will not be fought with bullets and bombs. It is an economic war, ahuman resources war, a war between nations and their surrogates, a war betweensecret societies and humanity. Us against them. Seven billion people against ahandful of the world’s most powerful and ruthless individuals.The chain of events set in motion on September 11 dictates that the UnitedStates, Russia, France, China, Germany, Great Britain, India, Israel and anyoneelse who can hold his own shall continue on a with series of global militaryconfrontations to control the natural resources of the planet.With the shedding of the first blood, the dropping of the first bomb, thekilling of the first child, the death of the first serviceman; a one-way borderto Hell has been crossed. Because of an ever expanding population base, food andwater wars are no longer a far-fetched conspiracy, but a frightening reality.In the process, our civilization has truly reached a point of no return. Andwith that crossing, economic and political forces have combined to form a“perfect storm”; the ravages of its outburst, now visible in every nook andcorner of the planet.There is no turning back. I wish I could say it another way, soften the blow,somehow. The “New Order” that I describe in this book with such determinationand detail is here. It is not a monolith, however; no single group of rich folkssits together in a dark room debating our planetary future. It is, quiteliterally, an order in which world power aggregates along geographic/geologiclines, forcing regions to become players against each other and runningroughshod over the nationalist sentiments of their subject populations.Most people still think in terms of nation-states – a virtuous concept cynicallyadministered by a pathologically meddlesome, promiscuous government spokesmenlike a daily dose of vitamins or anti-depressants. I think in terms of money,innovation and technology that money can buy.Money is a physical concept, not attached to a human sentiment or nationalidentity. That’s why all the dots I paint in this book connect in one straightline. It is about a wholesale transfer of the world’s wealth into fewer andfewer hands administered by ruthless and increasingly desperate elite.The collapse of the world’s financial system is here, and with it, a crisis ofproportions unseen in the annals of human history.The battle lines have been drawn. Area of conflict: Planet Earth. In the XXcentury, geography and money proved to be the ultimate trump cards becausegeography was governing economic decision-making. Afghanistan, Iraq,resources-rich South America and Africa, oil-rich Middle East, slave labor richSouth East Asia.Humanity, throughout history, has faced genocides, atrocities, poverty andstarvation. One thing is for certain though, in the end, good has alwaystriumphed – until now. In this new era, technology, like never before, isdestined to play a decisive role.Behind this realignment, enormous streams of capital are being expended and –more importantly – invested behind the scenes. The people controlling this moneyare not about to see their control dissipate as the nation-states vanish. Moneymakes its own rules. It is all about control … of everything on the planet.It no longer matters who runs which Western country. The powerful men behind thecurtain (secret societies, the elite, London, Wall Street and other financialinterests) will remove anyone not to their liking, or bad for their business.Business is money, and money makes its own rules.Totality of rule is not the only parameter of totalitarianism. The limitlessnessof power also proceeds from an omnipresent center. In the new totalitarianmovement, this omnipresent directive force communicates through technologicaladvancement and paradigm shift – the dominant nodes of the interlocked system.The Age of TransitionsWith the onset of post 9-11 world, we, the people, were asked to make someserious changes, in the name of freedom and fight against terrorists. The war onterror had begun, and with it we found ourselves living in the “terror” of apost 9-11 world.While people were slapping red, white and blue bumper stickers on their cars,the US government was busy holding a conference concerned with changes so largethat they promised to alter human nature itself. XXI century goals werediscussed in preparation in what would come to be known as ‘The Age ofTransitions.”December 3, 2001: A secret conference is held in Arlington, Virginia, USA. Thetitle “Age of Transitions” was coined by Newt Gingrich, in his introduction tothe National Science Foundation and Department of Commerce sponsored workshop onNBIC technologies (nanotechnologies, biology, information technology andcognitive technology).This workshop featured a wide range of participants, from governmental andprivate institutions to industry and academia such as nuclear and aerospacetechnology, psychology, computer science, chemistry, venture capital, medicine,bioengineering and social sciences.It was a chance for experts from NASA, MIT, Carnegie Mellon University, theDepartment of Defense, Hewlett Packard, the American Enterprise Institute, IBM,Raytheon, DARPA, National Institute of Mental Health and numerous othershandpicked for the occasion, to discuss their visions for the future. And thevisions discussed for the future were nothing short of Promethean. A stated keygoal was “enhancing human performance.” This in turn would lead to a “moreefficient societal structure.”Technological convergence was given as the answer to solve all of the world’snow infamous global problems. I quote from the report:> > Convergence of the sciences can initiate a new renaissance, embodying a> > holistic view of technology based on transformative tools, the mathematics> > of complex systems, and unified cause-and-effect understanding of the> > physical world from the nanoscale to the planetary scale.2The participants at the secret conference promised to bring about a newrenaissance of human development. As the world economy descends in a downwardspiral to Hell, the time for the elite to make the right decision gets shorterand shorter. They aren’t afraid of freedom. They are afraid of the chaos thaterupts when individuals have nothing but morality to constrain them. Absolutefreedom is no better than chaos.According to the report:> > Science and technology will increasingly dominate the world, as population,> > resource exploitation, and potential social conflict grow.3And grow it will.Technological advancements are not the end of the world, but merely seeds forchange.> > And change never comes without pain. It’s in our nature to want to rise> > above our limits. Think about it. We were cold, so we harnessed fire. We> > were weak, so we invented tools. Every time we met an obstacle, mankind used> > creativity and ingenuity to overcome it. The cycle is inevitable. But, will> > the outcome always be good? How often have we chased the dream of progress> > only to see that dream perverted?4The elite, the men who run the world from behind the curtain, have alwaysunderstood this. Technology offers strength, strength enables dominance, anddominance paves the way for abuse. It also risks giving some men absolute powerover others – regardless of the cost to human life.In the past, we have had to compensate for weaknesses. But what if we get to apoint when we never need to feel week or morally conflicted again? What if thepaths they, the men behind the curtain, want us to take, enables them to controlevery aspect of our lives?The Titan, Prometheus gave mankind fire; a gift he stole from the Gods.Prometheus represents the ability of humankind to discover new forms oftechnology, new universal physical principles, and to incorporate them into thelife and lives of the human species in order to change the relationship ofhuman-beings with the universe as a whole.Fire, was the first real piece of technology. “100,000 BC – stone tools, 4,000BC– the wheel, IX century AD – gunpowder. XV century – the printing press. XIXcentury – the light bulb! XX century – the automobile, television, nuclearweapons, spacecraft, Internet. XXI century – biotech, nanotech, fusion andfission, space travel. In the next 50 years, we will be able to createcybernetic individuals, who will be completely indistinguishable from us.”5Think about it! Think how far we have come from the first television sets 90years ago to today, and to the next generation into the future! It is simplymindboggling.2045: A New Era for HumanityWith that in mind, a new mega-movement was founded – Russia 2045. It’s objectiveis to create a new vector for civilization. It is aimed at human development andevolution.The Global Future 2045 International Congress was held in Moscow in February2012:> > …laid out a stark vision of the future for neo-humanity where AI,> > cybernetics, nanotech and other emerging technologies replace mankind – an> > openly transhumanist vision now being steered by the elite, but which> > emerged out of the Darwinian-circles directed by the likes of T.H.

The downside isthat we, the people, have not been invited to the party.According to Global Future 2045 International Congress:> > … by 2015, we will have an autonomous system providing life support for the> > brain and allowing it interaction with the environment is created.7By 2020, we will have the ability to transplant the brain into an AVATAR beingwith AVATAR being, man receives new, expanded life.> > By 2025, new generation of AVATAR provides complete transmission of> > sensations from all five robotic sensory organs to the operator.

By 2045, we will see drastic changes in social> > structure. The main priority of this development is spiritual> > self-improvement. A new era dawns. The era of neo-humanity.8Indeed, the transhumanists have big plans for humanity. Their star-studded goalis called “Project AVATAR” – human like robots controlled via brain computerinterface, supported and financed by US Department of Defense via DARPA andNASA.What’s fascinating is that David Cameron’s futurist film Avatar and our realworld are almost identical. The elite plans and the film’s storyline are toosimilar to be a coincidence.> > As Avatar begins, the year is 2154. Pandora is run by corporate elite at the> > top of world government (this is not free-market enterprise but total> > monopoly).

Man’s priority is his development as spiritual> > self-improvement.Where have we heard this before? How do you solve these universal problems? Byexercising universal control over all of humanity. One World Government anyone?Russia 2045 mega projects are linked to the Age of Transitions, the NationalScience Foundation Converging Technologies NBIC report, and Future Trends2007-2036 Report issued by the UK government, but discussed several years beforeat the Bilderberg 2005 conference in Germany.Henry Kissinger, David Rockefeller, Brzezinski, Hudson Institute, CarnegieEndowment, MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Yale, Bilderberg, CFR, Trilateral Commission:Cross pollination of the same people and organizations pulling the strings frombehind the scenes. So, what will future Man look like?By 2015, the race for immortality starts. In the next three years, thetranshumanists want to create an AVATAR – a robotic human copy controlled bybrain computer interface.According to Russia 2045:> > The 2045 social network for open innovation is expanding with projects such> > as AVATAR-A, a robotic copy of the human body controlled via Biological> > Computer Interface. Or an AVATAR-B, in which a human brain is transplanted> > at the end of one’s life.

Yet, a bigger question is just how far away is humanity fromtechnically reaching these lofty goals?Experts agree that a key element is to be able to reverse-engineer the humanbrain. And the key to reverse-engineering the human brain lies in decoding andsimulating the cerebral cortex — the seat of cognition. Futurist Ray Kurzweiland one of the visionaries behind Russia 2045 project says:> > It would be the first step toward creating machines that are more powerful> > than the human brain. These supercomputers could be networked into a cloud> > computing architecture to amplify their processing capabilities. Meanwhile,> > algorithms that power them could get more intelligent. Together these could> > create the ultimate machine that can help us handle the challenges of the> > future.The Russia 2045 report goes on to mention that: “By 2035, an implantableinformation chip could be developed and wired directly to the user’s brain …synthetic sensory perception beamed directly to the user’s senses,” andintegrated with the global civilization; that is a hive mind, which is outrightmind control, with no strings attached, in case you are wondering what I amtalking about. But, more on that later.As we have seen from the Strategic Trends Report, disconnecting from the hivemind will get the military police at your door in no time.Fittingly, two of the attendees at the Bilderberg 2012 conference in Chantilly,Virginia were Anatoly Chubais, CEO of open joint-stock company RUSNANO (formerlyRussian Corporation of Nanotechnologies) and a key ally of the ClintonAdministration. Chubais is also a former Vice Premier of the Russian governmentunder Yeltsin.Chubais, in the mid 1990s, was credited with “shock therapy” privatization andthe creation of the Russian oligarchs that overnight left 40% of Russianspenniless and starving.The other Russian attending Bilderberg 2012 was Igor Ivanov, Associate member ofRussian Academy of Science and President of Russian International AffairsCouncil, a subsidiary of the powerful US based Council on Foreign Relations.This is textbook TransHumanism, rooted in many ancient orders and the philosophyof eugenics.> > At its heart, TransHumanism represents an esoteric quest for godhood among> > certain circles of the elite connected to Masonry, occultism and> > science/technology wherein supposedly evolving, superior beings ‘ethically’> > replace lesser humans. This philosophy is portrayed in the blockbuster film> > Prometheus, directed by Sir Ridley Scott.11Prometheus the Movie – Future Plans of the EliteThe ideas in Prometheus are at the core of many ancient civilizations and theideas presented in the film at the heart of Western secret societies. Across theworld we see early civilizations’ obsession with what they believed to beoff-world influences.From Nazca lines in South America to the Pyramids of Egypt, we see artifacts,testament to early men’s obsession to off-world manipulators. Every ancientculture believed they were communicating with men from the sky. One could saythat Prometheus movie is simply art imitating life, and putting a 21-centuryspin on the beliefs of the Dogon tribe in Africa.What makes Prometheus such a powerful film is the fact that peopleunquestionably accept the reality presented – always. Popular culture, movies,music carry messages about how society works and how people should behave.Subliminal messages permeate television programs, computer games, magazines,billboards, products, and musical productions. They are just one of the weaponsin the arsenal of psychopathic corporations whose entire modus operandi concernsprofit and dehumanization.> > All that is truly aesthetic, traditional, cultural or substantial merely> > stands in the way of their monopolistic stratagems, their aggressive,> > relentless efforts at reducing the entire human race to a body of> > narcissistic, sense-infatuated, desensitized, amoral, immoral or actively> > criminal “smiling depressives.12Nevertheless, few people are aware of what we are up against.> > It is a secret, insidious type of war whose main battleground is the> > people’s minds.

In Greek mythology, the original “torch-bearer”was Prometheus, the Titan who stole the divine, impregnating flame from the godsin order to give it to humanity.In fact, the story of Christianity begins with a great blinding light from whichmen stumble only gradually, their eyes dazzled, toward the path of spiritualevolution, thus transforming the most perfect of animals on Earth into apotential god.Which leads to an obvious question: Are we the Gods yet?Except that the “we” doesn’t refer to us, the people, humanity in general, butrather to a privileged elite. 99% of humanity is oblivious to changes takingplace around them.How much of a wild guess would it be, if we were to predict a dystopian futurefor mankind where after a financial Armageddon that transferred most of theworld’s wealth into the hands of the moneyed elite, the poor and wretched masseslive under the high tech tyranny of wealthy elite?The elite have a Promethean plan – to change the world and to transform the veryessence of humanity.The Russia 2045 conference makes this very clear:> > We are facing a choice to fall into a new dark age, into affliction and> > degradation, or to find a new model for human development, and create not> > simply a new civilization but a new mankind. What we need is not a new> > technological revolution but a new civilizational paradigm. New philosophy> > and ideology, new ethics, new culture, new psychology and new metaphysics.> > We must reset our limits. Go beyond ourselves, beyond the Earth and beyond> > the solar system. New reality and future MAN will arise.14The elite’s Promethean goals are two-tiered. On the one hand, the elite havefunded technological progress for themselves. On the other, deindustrializationand zero growth as an economic prescription for the rest of mankind.This was clearly delineated in a report titled “The Changing Images of Man.” Iquote from the report:> > The concepts of democracy and freedom have disappeared, to be replaced by a> > high-tech dictatorship based on surveillance, monitoring, mass media> > indoctrination, police oppression and a radical division of social classes.Never publicly released and secretly named, “The Changing Images of Man,”15sprang from a policy report prepared by the Stanford Research Institute Centrefor the study of Social Policy.16The 319 page mimeographed report was prepared by a team of fourteen researchersand directed by a panel of twenty-three controllers including: Margaret Mead,B.F. Skinner, Ervin Laszlo of the United Nations, Sir Geoffrey Vickers ofBritish Intelligence. The entire project was overseen by Professor WillisHarmon, a “futurist,” whose specialty was promoting a post-industrial socialparadigm as a popular version of how to transform the United States into AldousHuxley’s Brave New World.In a 1961 lecture, Aldous Huxley had described a police state as:> > … the final revolution” – a “dictatorship without tears,” where people “love> > their servitude.… The twenty-first century will be the era of the World> > Controllers. He said the goal was to produce “a kind of painless> > concentration camp for entire societies so that people will, in fact, have> > their liberties taken away ... but ... will be distracted from any desire to> > rebel by propaganda or brainwashing ... enhanced by pharmacological> > methods…. There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific> > dictatorship should ever be overthrown.17The aim of the Stanford study, state the authors, is to change the desire ofmankind from that of industrial progress to one that embraces “spiritualism.”[War by non-violent or non-linear confrontation] The study asserts that, in ourpresent society, the “image of industrial and technological man” is obsolete andmust be “discarded.”Therefore, the SRI study concludes, we must change the industrial-technologicalimage of man fast:> > Analysis of the nature of contemporary societal problems leads to the> > conclusion that … the images of man that dominated the last two centuries> > will be inadequate for the post-industrial era.In fact, this far-reaching initiative for silent-weapon technology was firstdiscussed and put into action as an official doctrine by the Policy Committee ofthe Bilderberg Group at their inaugural meeting in 1954.Then they used the term “Quiet War” [WWIII] to describe the overt tacticalmethodology to subjugate the human race. The document, titled TOP SECRET: SilentWeapons for Quiet Wars, An introductory Programming Manual, was uncovered quiteby accident on July 7, 1986, when an employee of the Boeing Aircraft Companypurchased a surplus IBM copier for scrap parts at a sale and discovered insidedetails of a plan, hatched in the embryonic days of the “Cold War.” This manualof strategies called for control of the masses through manipulation of industry,peoples’ pastimes, education and political leanings. It called for a quietrevolution, pitting brother against brother, to divert the public’s attentionfrom what is really going on.Here is a partial quote from this document (TM-SW7905.1):> > It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of> > a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation systems (silent> > weapons) on a national or worldwide scale without implying extensive> > objectives of social control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery> > and genocide.

Do not deviate from them.The Future is WeIt was the hope of the three conferences, “The Age of Transitions,” the “GlobalFuture 2045 International Congress” and the “NBIC” conference, to integratehumanity with nature to save the Planet Earth from mankind. Visions laid outincluded robotics, cybernetics, artificial intelligence, life extension, brainenhancement, brain-to-brain interaction, virtual reality, genetic engineering,teleportation, human-machine interfaces, neuromorphic engineering and enhancedhuman capabilities for defense purposes.One thing is obvious. For the first time in history, the elite feel they have achance to steal the fire from the gods. To turn away from it now, to stoppursuing a future in which technology and biology combine, leading to thepromise of a “Singularity” – would mean to deny the very essence of who theyare.The Singularity is an era in which the collective intelligence of mankind willbecome increasingly, “nonbiological and trillions of times more powerful than itis today – the dawning of a new civilization through technological means,”18which will enable us to transcend our biological limitations and amplify ourcreativity. I will come back to the idea of Singularity later in the chapter.The elite can now become the gods they have always been striving to be. We, thegreat unwashed, might as well get used to it.After everything they have seen, all the fighting and the chaos, the fact is, asfar as the elite are concerned, deciding the future for all of mankind shouldn’tbe left up to a mass of raw minds swayed by elementary needs.The elite’s actual affection for the masses is captured in the following passageby T. H. Huxley:> > The great mass of mankind has neither the liking, nor the aptitude, for> > either literacy, or scientific, or artistic pursuits; nor, indeed, for> > excellence of any sort.And in any case, he said, the “great mass”was doomed to poverty due tooverpopulation:> > What profits it to the human Prometheus, if the vulture of pauperism is> > eternally to tear his very vitals?This is the very same sentiment that another secret society, Britain’sCoefficients Club, expressed back in 1902. The Bilderberg Group, in fact, is anatural extrapolation from this Club, founded in 1902. Lord Alfred Milner of theRound Table spoke of his vision for the future during a 1903 meeting at St.Ermin’s Hotel, over half a century before the Bilderberg Group was founded.Milner stressed a point:> > We must have an aristocracy – not of privilege, but of understanding and> > purpose – or mankind will fail. The solution does not lie in direct> > confrontation. We can defeat democracy because we understand the workings of> > the human mind, the mental hinterlands hidden behind the persona. I see> > human progress, not as the spontaneous product of crowds of raw minds swayed> > by elementary needs, but as a natural but elaborate result of intricate> > human interdependencies.In the early XX century, the common sentiment of the elite was called eugenics.After World War II with genocide still fresh in people’s minds, the term wasfirst changed to “interdependence,” and later in the century to “reengineering.”Today, it is called convergence – turning the genocidal view of the worldupside-down and inside out. Convergence is a priority area of importance inimplementing the great promise of a new day for the XXI century.In the past half a century we have unlocked some of the greatest secrets ofcosmos, and have advanced mankind towards a new world, breathing new fire andspirit into our understanding of the Universe. And in the process, some of theideas have gone from being awe-inspiring and revolutionary in their content tobeing perceived as part of the conventional wisdom.TranshumanismOne generously funded and organized group stands above all others in plottingthis funding for convergence – the “World Transhumanist Association.”Transhumanism is an ultra high tech dream of computer scientists, philosophers,neural scientists and many others. It seeks to use radical advances intechnology to augment the human body, mind and ultimately the entire humanexperience. It is the philosophy that supports the idea that mankind shouldpro-actively enhance itself and steer the course of its own evolution.Transhumanists wish to become what they call “post-human.” A post-human issomeone who has been modified with performance enhancing body and brainaugmentations to the point that they could no longer call themselves human. Theyhave mutated themselves into an all-together new being.Many people have trouble understanding what the true transhumanism movement isall about, and why it’s so awful. After all, it’s just about improving ourquality of life, right? Or is transhumanism about social control on a giganticscale?In fact, “social control” is exactly how powerful American foundations such asthe Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Endowment and Macy Foundation see it. Theability to make machines act like humans, and the ability to treat humans asmachines:> > … the final accomplishment of H.G. Wells’ old Fabian goal of a ‘scientific> > world order’ where everything is as neat as a differential equation, and> > unpredictable things such as human creativity never mess things up.19To most people, this sounds like something from a science fiction film. Few areaware of constant breakthroughs in technology, which makes the transhumanistvision a very real possibility for the near future.For example, neurochip interfaces, computer chips that connect directly to thebrain are being developed right now. The ultimate goal of a brain chip would beto increase intelligence thousands of time over – basically turning the humanbrain into the super computer.Lifelong emotional well-being is also a key concept within transhumanism. Thiscan be achieved through a recalibration of the pleasure centers in the brain.Pharmaceutical mood renders have been suggested, which will be cleaner and saferthan the mind-altering drugs.This is Huxley’s XXI century scientific dictatorship without tears. The era ofthe World Controllers … and as Huxley said,> > There seems to be no good reason why a thoroughly scientific dictatorship> > should ever be overthrown.The goal is to replace all aversive experience with pleasure beyond the doubtsof normal, human experience. Nanotechnology, for example, is a pivotal areaconcerning transhumanists. It is the science of creating machines, which are thesize of molecules. Such machines could create organic tissue for medical use.Using this type of technology could dramatically prolong life span. The GlobalFuture 2045 International Congress predicted that by 2045, it will be possibleto live forever by combining technology and biology into an event called: “TheSingularity.”The Singularity would occur at the point in which artificial intelligencesurpasses the capabilities of the human brain. From cyborgs with very long lifespans, to downloading consciousness itself into a machine, transhumanists saythat it is impossible to predict exactly what a post-human will be, but that itwill be better. Such lofty promises are being embraced by many people – for abetter world for everyone.No matter how you look at it, Singularity is being promoted as the greatsolution to our XXI century global problems. And thanks to the human genomeproject, we will soon be able to decode DNA itself. Through the use of appliedgenetics, science will then be able to improve the human race. What most peopledon’t realize is that this concept is not new.Transhumanism was born out of humanism, which is yet another clever disguise of“scientism,” created specifically so that global eugenics operations could becarried out without being noticed.EugenicsThroughout history, there have been those, who, with an eye to specificpolitical objectives have used terror or the threat of terror against targetedpopulations. The scientific rationale for tyranny has always been attractive tothe elites, because it creates a convenient excuse to treat their fellow menlower than animals.Eugenics, a crackpot notion of hereditary superiority and inferiority,originated in the 1880s and 1890s, and spawned by a British network of families,including Darwin’s cousin, Sir Francis Galton, Thomas Huxley, Sir ArthurBalfour, the Cadbury and the Wedgewood families as well as other late XIXcentury British Empire strategists linked to the Round Table movement of CecilRhodes and Lord Alfred Milner.> > Darwin and Huxley were members of the networks set up by the British East> > Indian Company and Privy Council to remold the cultural, scientific, and> > religious philosophy in England for imperial rule. Since Charles Darwin> > virtually never spoke in public, Huxley became his mouthpiece, his> > self-proclaimed ‘bulldog.’20The name “eugenics” was coined by Galton from a Greek term meaning “wellborn,”and already in 1869 Galton had written a book, Hereditary Genius, which arguedthat the aristocratic families of the British Empire were in fact, a superiorrace. That mental qualities are biologically inherited; that the white race isthe biologically best endowed to dominate the world, and that the English arethe cream of the white race. The fact that in the struggle for life, they hadmade it to the very top of society proved that they were the very best thathumanity had to offer.In his 1872 Enigmas of Life, W.R. Greg, considered the co-founder of eugenicswith Galton, said that Britain:> > … owes her world-wide dominion and ... the wide diffusion of her race over> > the globe, to a daring and persistent energy with which no other variety of> > mankind is so largely dowered…. At all events it is … the strongest and the> > fittest who most prevail, multiply, and spread, and become in the largest> > measure the progenitors of future nations.21Darwin credited his discovery of evolution to Reverend Parson Thomas Malthus, ahired pen for the British East Indian Company, who popularized the theory of:“scares, limited natural resources.” Malthusian law is similar to what wasproposed for the UN 1994 Cairo Population Conference: a theory in demographicsregarding population growth developed during the industrial revolution on thebasis of the writings of Malthus’ famous 1798, An Essay on the Principle ofPopulation, which was nothing more than a plagiarized version of Venetian monkGiammaria Ortes’ 1790 publication, Riflessioni sulla popolazione delle nazioni.According to his theory, population expands faster than food supplies.That is the typical sophism that the British Empire, throughout its history, hasattempted to use to brainwash human populations into believing in the existenceof the limits to growth. But the idea of sustainability capacity is based onanimal models. Hence the idea that for a certain square kilometers of land, fora given surface area, there is only a limited number of individuals of thatspecies that can be sustained or maintained by that territory.Malthus presented these ideas saying that human populations grow at anexponential rate or a geometric rate. They multiply by two every thirty or fortyyears, and that the ability of land to sustain these populations producing food,increases arithmetically. Through this calculation, Malthus stated that therewas a limit of sustainability for the land around the planet in terms of humanpopulations. And that soon, we as people were going to exceed this limitsustainability.Darwin emphasized his dependence on Malthus right in the introduction to his1859 book, The Origin of Species, whose full title is On the Origin of Speciesby Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favored Races in theStruggle for Life.> > The Struggle for Existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world> > ... inevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase…. This> > is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable> > kingdoms. As many more individuals of each species are born than can> > possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring> > struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however> > slightly in any manner profitable to itself … will have a better chance of> > surviving, and thus be naturally selected.Natural selection is genocide, extrapolated to its logical conclusion, a timeworn theme for the world’s elite. According to its twisted logic, some peopledeserve to live, but most of us, deserve to die. Darwin himself stated:> > … elite status is prima facie evidence of evolutionary superiority.Not surprisingly, the Royal Society, the scientific institution dedicated to theimprovement of natural knowledge picked up on these new ideas, and promotedDarwin heavily. Being the creation of the British Monarchy, the Royal Societywas obviously in favor of promoting the idea of the genetic superiority of theRoyal Family.Science was positioned to replace the old religious appeal of the Divine rightof Kings to rule over inferior races – us.Malthus and the British East India Company> > Malthus was not just any old country parson, but the official chief> > economist for the British East India Company (BEIC), the largest monopoly> > the world had ever seen, with an army in the late 18th and early 19th> > centuries that was larger than that of the British government itself.

They> > killed tens of millions in India alone, including by forcing them to grow> > opium instead of food, which opium the BEIC then used to poison the> > Chinese.22For example, between 1770 and 1771, five years after the consolidation of therule of the British East India Company on the Indian sub-continent, ten millionIndians died of hunger and malnutrition. The British East India Company was atthat time aspiring to World Empire. They had not only consolidated their controlof the British monarchy but also of Parliament. They had full control of Britishpolitics at the time. The British had just defeated the French in the SevenYears War, and the British East India Company was committed to an imperialpolicy that was made evident with the first Bengal famine in 1770.But the genocide in India did not stop there. In 1783, eleven million Indiansdied in less than two years, in the famous Chalisa famine. Some regions of Indiawere completely depopulated, 60% of the villages and towns disappeared from theface of the earth.Five years later, in 1788-89, some eleven million Indians died in the “Famine ofthe Skull,” named for the bleached bones of the victims whose bodies were piledup by the tens of thousands in the gutters. The living could not cope withburying such quantity of dead people.However, India was but one example of the “natural selection process” executedby London.The famous case is that of the potato famine in Ireland, called the “GreatHunger,” another example of organized genocide. It was well known in Irelandthat there was not a famine. Famine means food shortages. The Great Hunger wascaused by British Imperialist policy.There was plenty of food but it was being systematically exported during thisfamine. In 1847, two million Irish people starved and an estimated two millionothers emigrated. This means that between starvation and emigration, thepopulation of Ireland was cut in half, from 8.5 million people to just over 4million in two short years. This falls under the definition of genocide.The current situation in Africa should be on everyone’s mind because we aretalking about planned depopulation. What have British politics achieved afterdecades of colonial rule? The denial of technology.How do you explain that most of Africa is a famine invested no-man’s land ofpopulations living in sixteenth and seventeenth centuries’ conditions, when ascivilization, we have access to nuclear energy, desalination and high speedrail? Remember, we are in the year 2013. Massive diseases, technology denial,forced sterilization of the populations – this is what the real Africa lookslike.Forget about the UN based propaganda. This is a direct result of the racistimperial ideology – the idea that some races of the world are less deservingthan others to having access to modern technology and modern living standards.Darwin and the X ClubDarwin, a neurotic hypochondriac who rarely left his house,> > … was not a man, but a project, a figurehead for the cultural warfare that> > was run top-down by the Privy Council of the British Crown through the> > British East India Company and its network of salons and front-groups, such> > as the Metaphysical Society, the Oxford Essayists, the Coefficients Club,> > the Cambridge Apostles, who coined the term ‘agnosticism, and the elite> > men’s clubs of London, including the X Club of so-called scientists, which> > Huxley founded on November 3, 1864 to ram through Darwinism.> > Huxley was a leading figure in the so-called Working Men’s Movement, which> > was actually founded by the elite of Cambridge University, just like its> > successor of a couple of decades later, the Fabian Society.

Morgan Jr., Mary Duke Biddle of the tobacco family, Cleveland Dodge, JohnHarvey Kellogg of the breakfast cereal fortune, and Clarence Gamble of Proctor &Gamble.All of them were quietly funding eugenics as members of the American EugenicsSociety, and funding experiments into the forced sterilization of “inferiorpeople” and various forms of population control as far as World War I.> > Millions of index cards on the bloodlines of ordinary Americans were> > gathered, to plan the possible removal of entire blood lines deemed> > inferior. The aim of the index card project was to map the inferior> > bloodlines and subject them to lifelong segregation and sterilization to> > kill their bloodlines.26By 1910, the British had created the first network of social workers expresslyto serve as spies and enforcers of the eugenics race cult, which was rapidlytaking control of Western society. Winston Churchill, economist John MaynardKeynes, Arthur Lord Balfour and Julian Huxley, who went on to be the first headof UNESCO after the war, were all devout eugenicists.Clearly, one of the causes of world problems, as the elite saw it then and now,was:> > The persistent tendency of the human species to reproduce and multiply> > itself. An increasing number of people in the world meant a greater> > potential to cause trouble and to demand a bigger slice of the Big Pie of> > Life, which the Rockefellers and their wealthy friends regarded exclusively> > as their God-given right.27However, Hitler’s British financial backers weren’t the only ones sponsoringeugenics research. In the 1920s, the Rockefeller family bankrolled the KaiserWilhelm Institute for Genealogy and Demography,28 which later would form acentral pillar in the Third Reich.At the end of the war, with corpses still smoldering across Europe, the alliesprotected from prosecution the very Nazi scientists such as Joseph Mengela, whohad tortured tens of thousands of people to death. The Nazi radical brand ofeugenics had embarrassed the Anglo-American social controllers, making“eugenics” and “mental hygiene” dirty words.The controllers, however, wouldn’t be deterred. In 1956, the British EugenicsSociety decided in a resolution that, “the society should pursue eugenics byless obvious means.” This meant “planned parenthood” and the environmentalistmovement. The World Wildlife Fund and its direct action terrorist arm,Greenpeace, as well as like-minded groups are not just a lunatic fringe that caneasily be ignored; they are the shock troops of the oligarchy in their fightagainst humanity.Every population control policy has been simply renamed as they continued theirwork under the protection of the United Nations and its associate organizations.The Eugenics, Euthanasia and Mental Hygiene Societies of Britain, America andthe rest of Europe, was simply renamed to the more palatable Mental HealthAssociation of Great Britain, and National Association of Mental Health of theUnited States that later became World Federation of Mental Health.Eugenics Quarterly Magazine became Social Biology, and the American BirthControl League became Planned Parenthood, which today is responsible for amassive depopulation in Africa.It is not widely known that some of the largest aid agencies, and U.S. ChristianFundamentalist groups, have been covertly running pogroms in Africa over thepast several decades.Its banner is “Family Planning,” which is being turned on its head, when onefully understands the real implications and far-reaching objectives. Thesefamily planning policies are vigorously and consistently advocated by majorbilateral donors such as the U.S. Government through its surrogate, U.S.-AID andmultilateral agencies, most notably the International Planned ParenthoodFederation (IPPF), the U.N. Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) and the WorldBank in Africa.Eugenics was being accepted as a genuine form of science. Social Darwinism madestrong advances towards a world in which scientism would fulfill Galton’s dreamof having eugenics be the religion of the future.Prominent eugenicist Julian Huxley stepped up and offered a solution. He simplyinvented a new word to replace eugenics. That term being, transhumanism, whichhe defined as:> > A need for mankind to realize the importance of steering the direction of> > its own evolution.Yes, eugenics was one of the original aspects of transhumanism, and it was nosurprise that Julian was a President of British Eugenics Society, which had thetask of removing undesirable “variants” from the human gene pool.Meanwhile, immediately after the war, Sir Julian Huxley changed the name of theprogram for enforced birth control, zero economic growth, the technology of massmind control, and continued to apply the principles which created Nazi Germany’smass genocide against the “racially unfit.”In 1946, Huxley announced that:> > Even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for> > many years politically and psychologically impossible, it will be important> > for UNESCO to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest> > care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that> > much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable.In 1974, Henry Kissinger, Huxley’s intellectual son said,> > Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the> > third world.Huxley was a founder of the British Eugenics Society, and the firstDirector-General of UNESCO, which pushed for population reduction, and whatHuxley called “a single culture for the world.” He was also a leading member ofWorld Federation of Mental Health, director of the Abortion Law ReformAssociation, and founder of the World Wildlife Fund, whose first president wasthe former card-carrying Nazi, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands. PrinceBernhard was also one of the organizers of the Bilderberg meetings since itsinception in 1954.Few realize that Huxley represented a social set of miscreants the likes ofwhich have not been seen since. Amongst them was his grandfather, Thomas Huxley,whose outspoken support of Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution earned him thenickname, ‘Darwin’s Bulldog; his personal mentor and Satanist Aleister Crowley;Brigadier John Rawlings Rees; Bertrand Russell and H.G. Wells, whose OpenConspiracy was a call for fascist imperial world dictatorship.> > What makes the “open conspiracy” open, is not the laying out of some secret> > master-plan, not the revealing of the membership roster of some inner> > sanctum of the rich and powerful, but rather, the understanding that ideas,> > philosophy and culture, control history.Also involved is Julian’s brother, Aldous, of the Brave New World fame. InAldous Huxley’s book, the population is genetically divided into Alphas, Betas,all the way down to the synthetically produced Epsilon morons through theapplication of eugenics, or Nazi breeding laws.Hive MindThe transhumanists have a popular term – “hive mind,” which refers to the giantcollective intelligence that might be created when people all over the worldlink their brains together with technology. In other words, creating a whole newintelligence through symbiotic existence. In reality, the hive mind will beGalton Darwin’s beehive, a creation of a new man, which has been written aboutfor many years.There is a great deal of talk about the hive mind in the NBIC report. I quote:> > We envision the bond of humanity driven by an interconnected virtual brain> > of the Earth’s communities searching for intellectual comprehension and> > conquest of nature.> > A networked society of billions of human beings could be as complex compared> > to an individual human being as a human being is to a single nerve cell.> > From local groups of linked enhanced individuals to a global collective> > intelligence, key new capabilities would arise from relationships arising> > from NBIC technologies. Such a system would have distributed information and> > control and new patterns of manufacturing, economic activity, and education.> > It could be structured to enhance individuals’ creativity and independence.> > Far from unnatural, such a collective social system may be compared to a> > larger form of a biological organism. Biological organisms themselves make> > use of many structures such as bones and circulatory system. The networked> > society enabled through NBIC convergence could explore new pathways in> > societal structures, in an increasingly complex system.29> > It may be possible to develop a predictive science of society and to apply> > advanced corrective actions, based on the convergence ideas of NBIC. Human> > culture and human physiology may undergo rapid evolution, intertwining like> > the twin strands of DNA, hopefully guided by analytic science as well as> > traditional wisdom. The pace of change is accelerating, and scientific> > convergence may be a watershed in history to rank with the invention of> > agriculture and the Industrial Revolution.30It is this human beehive, which has been the ideal society in the eyes of theelite for a very long time. This is a template for “post humanity,” the ultimateslave race, scientifically designed to never rebel, and the wholesaledisappearance of the human being with his and her divine spark of reason at theexpense of group speak, group think and group actions.Julian Huxley could not have said it better himself. However, let’s not forgetJulian’s brother, Aldous Huxley, author of Doors of Perception and the Brave NewWorld. On March 20 1962, he gave a lecture at the UC Berkley in which he clearlylaid out the vision of a planned future society:> > In the past, we can say that all revolutions have essentially aimed at> > changing the environment in order to change the individual. Today, we are> > faced with the approach of what may be called the ultimate revolution, the> > final revolution where man can act directly on the mind body of his fellows.> > The nature of the ultimate revolution which we are now faced is precisely> > this; that we are in process of developing a whole series of techniques> > which will enable the controlling oligarchy that always existed and> > presumably will always exist, to get people to actually love their> > servitude.> > First of all, to standardize the population, to iron out inconvenient human> > differences.

One of the more> > recent developments in the sphere of neurology is the implantation of> > electrodes in the brain.

Therefore, the success of> > this convergent technologies priority area is essential to the future of> > humanity.Transhumanism fills people’s hopes and minds with dreams of becoming superhuman,but the fact of the matter is that the true goal is the removal of that pesky,human free will itself.There is no possibility for discovery of a new universal principle of sciencebecause the actual principles of human knowledge are not confined to what islearned. As Johannes Kepler exhaustively explained in his, The Harmonies of theWorld: “the human personality has access, by the unique nature of human mind’sunique power of cognition,” unique among all living creatures, “to generatepreviously unknown, validatable universal physical and comparable principles”which increase our species’ power in and over the universe per capita and persquare feet of space.To annul this unique nature of human mind, a parallel world of Jungian thoughtcan now be found to be intertwined with the ideas of “New Age.” From beercommercial memes that talk of the collective unconscious, to the Star Warsseries and the mass-marketed virtual reality, these thoughts are consciouslybuilding on Jungian imagery and mystical ideas. To them:> > … this new technology is the key to open the doors of perception to Jungian> > dream world.31However, this Jungian Star Wars “dream world” is more like a recurringnightmare. The most crucial epistemological issue is often overlooked. Do theseStar Wars, Doom and Lord of the Rings creatures look human to you? The secondissue is how do you corrupt people into Jungian mysticism? Obviously, bydehumanizing the image of man. Therein lies a principle of evil pervading“virtual consciousness.”Post-humanity will be a new human, which has been genetically engineered andbrain-chipped for total control. Part man and part machine, the new man will nolonger have a need of the sexual reproductive function. If the elite’s plan isto reduce the world’s population, can you think of a better way to do that?What does the NBIC report says? Exactly that.> > Individuals have served to keep the gene pool stirred up and healthy via> > sexual reproduction, but this data handling process would no longer> > necessarily be linked to individuals. With knowledge no longer encapsulated> > in individuals, the distinction between individuals and the entirety of> > humanity would blur.This may seem like something out of a science fiction novel, but this bizarreand horrific scenario is not only possible, it is intended, although we won’tarrive at this point overnight. But how?Virtual RealityFirst, we must step into the world of virtual reality, where our identity aspurely human may blend with that of our new virtual persona, where you can besomeone else. Is this possible?Few are aware of constant breakthroughs in technology, which makes thetranshumanist vision a reality in the next five years. Artificial intelligence,and the creation of thinking robots is closely related to themind-machine-merger concept of neurochips interfaces. Computer chips thatconnect directly to the brain are being developed right now. The ultimate goalof a brain chip will be to increase intelligence thousands of time over,basically turning the human brain into the super computer.There is a growing perception that machine parts may be added to human bodies tocreate cyborgs, a term invented by Dr. Nathan Kline, a psychiatrist linked tothe CIA and MK-ULTRA, mind control experiments.Kline had co-written an article with Manfred Clynes for the September 1960 issueof Astronautics entitled: “Cyborgs and Space,” which first introduced the term“cyborg” into the English language.Using the problem of deep space travel, they discussed “the cybernetic aspects”of homeostatic processes in the body in order to develop ways to keep astronautsawake for weeks.32Lifelong emotional well being is a key concept within transhumanism. This can beachieved through a recalibration of the pleasure centers in the brain. Thebuilding of a virtual utopia, via mood renders, and the merging of nanobots andbiology.> > If you can use nanobots to control your brain, you wouldn’t even need money> > and possessions to be happy. You could stimulate any living experience in> > your head.33The goal is to replace all aversive experience with pleasure, beyond the doubtsof a normal human experience.Nanotechnology, for example, is a pivotal area for transhumanists. It is thescience of creating machines, which are the size of molecules. Such machinescould create organic tissue for medical use. Using this type of technology coulddramatically prolong life span. For how long, you ask? How does forever sound toyou?In less than one generation, humanity may merge totally with technology byuploading individual consciousness to virtual reality. Upon being uploaded, onecould then live forever within a computer-generated reality – leaving thephysical body behind.In this machine, the individual could merge his intelligence with the collectiveintelligence of all others in the digital reality, effectively becoming onesuper intelligent being. A concept we have already discussed: the ‘hive mind.’But, it goes way beyond that. One of the grand visions is to upload human mindsinto holographic bodies. A three-dimensional hologram, blurring reality andvirtual reality by projecting images with blue beam or barium and strontium(contents of nuclear fallout), turning our beloved blue sky into a giantmind-numbing television set. You don’t believe me?Back in 1998, U.S. Army Research Laboratory patented a three-dimensionalholographic display using strontium and barium for holography. In fact, the USgovernment has a patent for holographic clouds (Patent 5409379), which was filedway back in 1993. In 1994, the USG patented the use of holographic clouds in ascene (Patent US 5489211).Again, how many people see a parallel with Jung’s ‘collective unconscious’?> > Only through the recognition of the dimension of the collective unconscious> > can science serve the interests of man.Except that virtual reality and computers cannot replicate human intelligentthought process. What AI can do, is to alter consciousness, in a similar waythat LSD played with the human mind back in the 1960s.The World of MatrixThe government and industry has done a good job inserting us into a Matrix. Weare being sucked into our iPhones, sucked into video games, into RD interface.Theoretical physicist, Michio Kaku is convinced that: “by 2020 there will be anentire three dimensional universe in cyberspace, with virtual countries andgovernments, virtual schools and universities, virtual property and stockmarkets, and virtual family and friends.”According to a futurist, Ray Kurzweil:> > Virtual reality will become more and more like real reality but have the> > advantage that I can share a virtual reality environment, incorporating all> > of the senses, with someone else, even if they are hundreds of kilometers> > apart. It has a lot of advantages over real reality.There is a general consensus amongst people that:> > … in 10 years, things like second life will become just as prevalent as> > email now, and I think virtual worlds will have a similar way for people to> > get together and communicate.To give skeptics the benefit of the doubt, perhaps this version of humanity ispure speculation.However, converging technology does present a need for radical change withinsociety, no matter how it is applied. This point is made over and over again inthe National Science Foundation NBIC 2001 report.The message of the report is abjectly clear. The world of virtual reality is aworld of totally controlled environment.Jaron Lanier of VPL Research, Inc. says:> > If you can generate enough stimuli outside one’s sense organs to indicate> > the existence of a particular alternate world, then a person’s nervous> > system will kick into gear and treat the stimulated world as real.Furthermore, if virtual reality technology is administered as a brainwashingtool, it can weaken what the Freudians call the “super-ego,” that part of thepersonality that coheres to one’s moral conscience, which is the basis for truthseeking on the one hand and uniquely human act of fundamental discovery andintegration of new universal principles which have improved the lives of peopleper square feet of space against nature on the other.In fact, science has tried to phase out our built in connection to the universe,and replace it with the “consensual hallucination” of virtual reality.Please understand this environment that has been created, made-to-order by thecorporate mass media.TV Made to OrderTake a look at some of the most popular television programs in our culture:American Idol, Survivor, and the game shows. These are designed to reinforce thesocial Darwinian concept of competition. In order to survive, you must to outdoyour competitors. This is the recurrent theme in our society. We have all beenpropagandized to have low self esteem.The only way to feel good about oneself is to succeed. Success involvesacquiring anything that is bigger and better. To succeed today, you mustembellish the material things around you, particularly if you want to becomesomeone important. That there is a difference between the individual and hisimage is human nature.We are expected to accept this as a law of nature. After all, it is survival ofthe fittest. This is the way we are told that species evolve. You don’t want tohold humanity back now, do you?Think of the mass media that prays on our insecurities. Advertising, in manyways, is a con game, too: fitness magazines, fashion, obsession with celebrity,youth, wealth and beauty. We are obsessed with youth and enhancement.Advertising is a process of manufacturing glamour. The state of being envied iswhat constitutes glamour. Advertising, then, is about the solitary happinessthat comes from being envied by others. But envy has a dark side, which largelyhas been lost to the twentieth century thought.Since medieval times, envy has been considered a major term for identifying thecauses of human suffering. Like despair, envy derives from the separation of theperson from the object of desire, combined with a sense that one is powerless toattain what is desired. In envy, the urge to reach out becomes the urge todestroy.Advertising is the consumer culture’s version of mythology. No society existswithout some form of myth. Thus, it is not very surprising that a society whichis based on the economy of mass production and mass consumption will evolve itsown myth in the form of a commercial. Like myth, it touches upon every facet oflife, and as a myth it makes use of the “fabulous” in its application to themundane.No matter how you look at it, people do not need new automobiles every thirdyear, plasma televisions bring little enrichment of the human experience, and ahigher or lower hemline offer no expansion of consciousness, no increase in thecapacity to love.Because products do not provide the kind of psychic payoff promised by theimagery of advertising, we are left to doubt whether anything can. If we followthis doubt, we wind up contemplating a state of mind in which a black holesurrounds almost every product like a ghostly negative of its radiance – theblack hole of failed promise.And into this black hole, brought about by advertising’s exploitation of so manyideal images, steps any religion that promises to cut through the cycle ofidolatry and connect us with the one great “Ideal” that transcends all others:God, immortality, cosmic consciousness, enlightenment, the spirit world, thedeep self or whatever name It has.Enter the world of virtually reality where your every dream, that “Ideal,” cancome true.Virtual reality, we are told, creates an artificial world in which we are freeto do whatever we want without being accountable for our actions. If you want tohave sex with a computer generated image of your neighbor’s dog, that’sperfectly all right, go ahead and have it in the virtual world.With that liberation of our “repressed fantasies,” if one is to believeFreudian-speak: Virtual reality produces a new consciousness that redefines goodand evil. In the words of that other famous psychopath, Friderich Nietzsche, itis a universe: “beyond good and evil.” Thus we are liberated to do evil,“without suffering the effect of evil and therefore purge ourselves of ourinnate desire to ‘be’ evil.”34This fantasized pinnacle of the transhumanist world provides us with theclearest view of its deadly ends, a world seen through eyes lacking universaltruth and a sacred responsibility of the sovereign individual to act for Good.> > And without universal truth, there can be no reason. If truth is killed,> > then our civilization is killed with it.35The only change over the past fifty years has been that as technicalsophistication has increased, so has circumspection. It should be of littlesurprise then that the advertising medium has even been reshaping our veryconcept of truth.In Brave New World, Aldous Huxley posited the universal application of a drugcalled Soma for the manipulation of the populace. Now, the ultimate form of Somaenhancement is at our fingertips – transhumanism.Transhumanism offers the ultimate form of bettering yourself. You want to beyoung? How does eternal life sound? You want to be strong? How about adding somemachine parts to your body? You want to be smart? Here, put this computer chipin your head. You could become omnipotent and, to those who could afford it,immortal.Genetic Treatments to Prevent the Effects of Ageing Developments in genetics:> > … will allow treatment of the symptoms of aging and this would result in> > greatly increased life expectancy for those who could afford it. The divide> > between those that could afford to ‘buy longevity’ and those that could not,> > could aggravate perceived global inequality.36Dictatorial or despotic rulers could potentially also “buy longevity,”prolonging their regimes and international security risks.If you think that transhumanism is being introduced into such a fiercelycompetitive world by chance, think again. We have all been trained likePavlovian dogs with a nonstop barrage of propaganda. If we don’t own up to thisreality, we will all be outdone by our superiors, those people who have alwaysbelieved themselves to be the pinnacle of human greatness.And this is exactly what the National Science Foundation NBIC report postulates:> > Enhancing human performance would require merging human biology with> > technology.Brain machine interfaces, would allow the control of machinery with the brainitself. Implantable brain chips would also be able to store information andenhance cognitive function. The ultimate human machine symbiosis would be todownload the actual copy of a person’s brain into a super computer.I repeat, this would allow someone to effectively life forever in acomputer-generated virtual simulation. And of course, the military implicationsof convergence are quite obvious. A cybernetic enhancement of human performanceis inevitable. Achieving these visions requires the decoding and understandingof complex systems. The most important complex system being the human brain.After all, it is the driving force behind human performance.MK-ULTRA: Back to the FutureIn 1952, a proposal was issued to the Director of Central Intelligence outliningfunding mechanism for highly sensitive CIA research and development project thatwould study the use of biological and chemical materials such as LSD, inaltering human behavior.On April 13, 1953, MK-ULTRA, was established for the express purpose ofresearching and developing chemical, biological, and radiological materials tobe used in clandestine operations and capable of controlling or modifying humanbehavior.All in all, there were 149 MK-ULTRA sub-projects, many of them involved withresearch into behavior modification, hypnosis, drug effects, psychotherapy,truth serums, pathogens and toxins in human tissues.For intelligence purposes, what was required of MK-ULTRA was the ability tomanipulate memory. Thus, what the Freudians call the “superego” had to bebypassed, allowing the controller direct access to the contents of an enemyagent’s mind. That was step one. Step two would involve erasing specific piecesof information from the subject’s memory and replacing those pieces with newbits of memory, thus permitting the Agency to send that agent back into thefield without any knowledge that he or she had been interrogated and had givenup sensitive information. Step three was a potential bonus: Could that enemyagent then “be programmed” to commit acts on behalf of the Agency, withoutknowing who gave the command or why?This was the essence of the Manchurian Candidate. It is also the essence of whatwe know today as hypnotherapy and “depth” psychoanalysis, for the psychiatristis looking for access to the patient’s unconscious layers, to extract importantinformation, such as childhood trauma, and to neutralize the effects of thattrauma, in some cases replacing certain behavior patterns with new, approvedpatterns.But in exploring the mind and developing techniques for unlocking its secrets,the CIA unknowingly tread on areas that have been the domain of religion andmysticism for thousands of years.Scouring the records of occultists, magicians, witches, voodoo priests andSiberian shamans to isolate the techniques that were used since time immemorialto supplant a person’s normal, comfortable, everyday consciousness, and replaceit with a powerful, all-knowing and sometimes violent, and always deceptivealter personality. And to then use those alters to uncover the action of deepmemory, for MK-ULTRA was, at its core, an assault on the Land of Memory; thecreation of new, false memories and the eradication of old, dangerous ones.As these monstrous notions of mass social engineering were being presented as a“humanistic” alternative to World War in the age of the atomic and hydrogenbomb, the world’s intelligence agencies and governments were already hard atwork on crucial projects that a generation or two later would shape theimplementation of a “Brave New World,” and bring us, hoi polloi, kicking andscreaming to “their” new reality of Planetary Governance.NeuroscienceNeuroscience is the study of the nervous system. With advances in chemistry,computer science, engineering, medicine and other disciplines, neuroscience nowalso includes the study of the molecular, cellular, developmental, structural,functional, evolutionary, computational, and medical aspects of the nervoussystem. From molecular and cellular studies of individual nerve cells to imagingof sensory and motor tasks in the brain, neuroscience has crossed the thresholdof science and has become a key element of national security apparatus the worldover.As the power to decode the brain accelerates, changes will sweep quickly acrossevery society in a slightly different way.Intelligence agencies have been spending millions of dollars on neuroscienceresearch in hopes that it will soon deliver extremely advanced tools forprotecting national security.

Emotional detection systems will pervade public areas, as globalsurveillance networks could seek out terrorists and criminals.The preponderance of the research now creating our emergent neuro-society isbeing underwritten by America’s defense spending. According to Association ofAmerican Universities, nearly 350 colleges and universities hold Pentagonresearch contracts, amongst them Cal Tech, the University of California,California Institute of Technology, Cornell, MIT, Harvard, Yale, Princeton,Indiana University, The University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, PennState University, University of Minnesota, Stanford, University of Texas,University of Washington. These schools represent 60 percent of basic researchfunding.President Obama’s budget request for Fiscal Year 2013 included $140.820 billionfor research and development (R&D). Seven federal agencies receive 95.8% oftotal federal R&D funding, with the Department of Defense (50.6%) and theDepartment of Health and Human Services (22.3% primarily for the NationalInstitutes of Health) accounting for nearly three-fourths of all R&D funding.38In an article published a decade ago by the US Army War College, militaryanalyst, Timothy Thomas used the title: “The Mind Has No Firewall.” The articleexamined energy based weapons, psychotropic weapons, and other developmentsdesigned to alter the ability of the human body to process the stimuli.Humanity stands on the brink of psychotronic warfare, with the mind and the bodyas the focus. Psychotronic weapons are those that can remove and replacememories in the human brain. A former major in the Russian army reported in aFebruary 1997 military journal that many weapons fitting the psychotronicdefinition are being developed throughout the world.Research shows that there may have already been deployment of USSR-USApsychotronic warfare even before “The Mind Has No Firewall” was published.Disturbingly titled “Project Pandora,” the research was run by the psychologydivision within the psychiatry research section of Walter Reed Army Institute ofResearch. Pandora was initiated after the United States learned that the Sovietgovernment had from the 1953 to 1976, beamed microwave radiation at the UnitedStates Moscow Embassy.DARPAJanuary 2008 issue of Aviation Week carried an article by Amy Kruse, a woman whooversees some of the most provocative DARPA research, such as research intocomputer analysis of brain waves detected from a satellite without the subject’sknowledge. Which is expected to help intelligence analysts precisely identifyand locate targets based on the hostile thoughts of enemy forces.Furthermore,> > The Pentagon’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency has tapped Northrop> > Grumman to develop binoculars that will tap the subconscious mind.

According to DARPA:> > Cognitive Technology Threat Warning System (CT2WS) war fighters need to be> > able to see and identify threats at as great a distance as possible.> > Binoculars have not yet integrated the technology or biology that could help> > maximize this capability.

He was a full-time terrorist operative in the1970s and 80s, who supplied weapons and passports to both Red Brigades whokilled Aldo Moro, and the “black” fascists who bombed Bologna train station.Honeywell’s work is augmented with participation from Teledyne Scientific &Imaging and Columbia University.Teledyne is not your run-of-the-mill high tech company working on new generationwashing machines. Their key projects consist of such things as:> > … design, development and production of high performance infrared and> > visible sensor subsystems used in space missions, long range terrestrial> > surveillance and targeting and astronomy applications and energy harvesting> > technologies, electronic device packaging, biomaterials, and liquid> > crystal-based optical devices.44How far out into space is that?> > In ‘Minority Report’ Tom Cruise’s character, John Anderton, has a radical> > surgery to replace his eyes so that he can get past security systems that> > scan his retina to identify him.

The laws to justify these technologies are not written on a whim. Theyare specifically designed to give the government carte blanche authority overthe people during the chaos and confusion of the Age of Transitions. Transitionto a planetary civilization.You see, the future bin Ladens and Kaddafis are not the enemy. In fact, theynever were. You are the enemy. Whether at the airports, border crossing or onthe street corner, from now on we will be mind-probed by amazing new technologybeing developed by the Human Factors Division of the DHS Science & Technologydirectorate.> > The DHS chaps themselves are relatively cagey about exactly how their> > mind-reader/lie-detector gear would work.

The applications, of course, are oriented towards “UniversalDarwinism.” And as the National Science Foundation report openly states:“Certain ideas may have the force of a social virus.”47 Not surprisingly, thereport also gives a visionary solution to the war on terror:> > Socio-tech can help us win the war on terrorism. It can help us to> > understand the motivations of the terrorists and so eliminate them.Phase three is expected to produce a prototype that intelligence agencies willroad test in 2014. According to Honeywell, the technology is nearly ready foroperational use.All together, Augmented Cognition and NIA research has linked several corporateand academic teams with the four different US military services: DaimlerChrysler with United States Marine Corp, Lockheed Martin with United StatesNavy, Boeing with the Air Force and Honeywell with a team of eleven industry anduniversity partners with the Army.One of the most talked about areas of research, is something called the “ActiveDenial System,” ADS. ADS is a by-product of larger on-going research looking fortechnology that could delete, and then replace a person’s memories via the useof electromagnetic radiation.If you are thinking “Men in Black” Hollywood science fiction, you are absolutelyright. Except the technology, called “Amnesia Beam” is here; ready to be used ata moment’s notice. What’s more, a team of neuroscientists has actually developeda brain scan based on finding hints about what a subject is intending to do.This is a nightmare version of Minority Report made reality.Scientists claim that:> > The seeds of criminal and anti-social behavior can be found in children as> > young as three. More researchers believe that violent tendencies have a> > biological basis, and that tests and brain imaging can pick them up in> > children.> > By predicting which children have the potential to be trouble, treatments> > could be introduced to keep them on the straight and narrow.

The theories were put forward by two leading> > criminologists at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in> > Washington.48Please understand, these are not publicly funded projects for the betterment ofhumanity, but they are mostly secret experiments sanctioned in the name ofdefense, which when put on its head, is crime prevention and extrapolated intothe future is tailor-made to put down any rebellion by the 99% of the world’spopulation destined to live in abject poverty in crime infested Mega-Cities ofthe future.How much does all of this cost? Even though the actual numbers do not exist,what is known is that Pentagon’s black operations budget is estimated at $6billion per year.What every one must understand is that the future is not about nuclear weapons.We are now in an arms race to create the next generation of unimaginably potentand terrifying weapons.One such project is Honeywell’s Advanced Image Triage System. It includes groupbehavioral analysis software and individual emotion recognition algorithms thatkey off micro-emotional tics we all exhibit. Intelligence analysts will scourreal time surveillance feeds from satellites, unmanned predators, roboticinsects and other ingenious surveillance systems in their efforts to seek anddestroy enemy combatants.The rise of neuro-weapons is here: aimed at shifting the emotional and cognitivecapacity of individuals. Memory bombs that give individuals short term amnesiaor electronic sleep inducing weapons may seem in the realm of science fiction,but before the advent of atomic weapons nobody imagined that a bomb wouldinstantly kill 140,000 inhabitants of Hiroshima.Total Spectrum DominanceAs more and more biology and chemistry labs focus on developing next generationbrain drugs, other researchers working on a different piece of theneuro-technology revolution, are designing implantable medical devices thatinteract with the brain through tiny electrical impulses.Over the next two decades, the impact of neuro-devices on a nano-scale will beprofound. The reason so much more is at stake is that the:> > … newest tools will give us nothing less than an increasingly precise> > control over the most powerful factor in our lives – our own minds.49Of all the storage mediums you use to keep information that is most important tous, our brain is by far the most complex. Recent advances in brain imaging,hierarchical recurrent temporal memory, and complex brain network theory, aswell as neuro-robotics are making hacking the human brain a distinctprobability.This is one of DARPA’s high end reverse-engineering projects:> > With 50 million neurons (processing elements) and several hundred kilometers> > of axons (wires) terminating in almost on trillion synapses (connections)> > for every cubic centimeter, and consuming only about 12 watts energy for the> > entire cortex, the brain is arguably one of the most complex and densely> > packed, yet highly efficient information processing systems known.

One of their keyinitiatives is “Project Quasar” whose objective:> > … is to pull together all our existing knowledge about the human brain and> > to reconstruct the brain, piece by piece, in supercomputer-based models and> > simulations.52Project Quasar is part of the Human Brain Project (HBP), one of the EU’s twoFuture and Emerging Technologies (FET) initiative Flagship directives.> > The project aims to combine information about users to build business models> > that provide a more efficient use of the available frequency spectrum.53EU wants to connect the dots leading from genes, molecules and cells to humancognition and behavior. Buried in the report and never mentioned in public is aframework dealing with the problem of how to fuse humans and machines.In 2011, a team of scientists created a chip that can control the brain and canbe used as a storage device for long-term memories.> > In studies the scientists have been able to record, download and transfer> > memories into other hosts with the same chip implanted.54This may sound like an amazing break through, but what few realize is that theadvancement in technology brings the world one step closer to a global policestate and the reality of absolute mind control.> > More terrifying is the potential for implementation of what was only a> > science fiction fantasy – the ‘Thought Police’ – where the government reads> > people’s memories and thoughts and can then rehabilitate them through> > torture before they ever even commit a crime based on a statistical computer> > analysis showing people with certain types of thoughts are likely to commit> > a certain type of crime in the future.55Too far-fetched for your liking?

Now, a mere 14 years later, soldiers are given packsof these drugs to take on the battlefield, including antidepressants, and theyself-medicate.Among them, cognitive-augmentation drugs such as modafinil, which enhancesalertness even after long hours of wakefulness, are becoming widespread. That’sa huge paradigm change, and it has to do with a deal that was cooked up betweenthe US military and Big Pharma.However, the self-medicating soldiers still are involved in making certainpersonal choices. One of these is whether to take the drugs or not. The militarywould to eliminate that pesky free will and the element of the unknown. How?How about micro chipping your brain?> > That might not sound very appealing to you at this point, but this is> > exactly what the big pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline and the> > big technology companies have planned for our future.57Again, the key word is control, in all of it manifestations. The NationalScience Foundation NBIC 2001 report spends an exorbitant amount of time onexamining control and human behavior. I quote:> > The multiple drivers of human behavior have long been known. Now, through> > the decoding of complex systems a completely predictable and managed society> > can be realized….

Of course nobody is going to force you to have a microchip implanted intoyour brain, when they are first introduced.As the Financial Times reports:> > Diseases such as diabetes and epilepsy and conditions such as obesity and> > depression will be treated through electronic implants into the brain by> > sending electrical signals to malfunctioning cells rather than pills,> > injections or surgery.59And as Financial Times asks:> > If a brain implant could cure a disease that you have been suffering from> > your whole life would you take it?The Journey Toward Making “Normal” ObsoleteOne of the ways of manipulating human brain activity is through optogenetics, arevolutionary new form of wireless communication in which nerve cells in thebrain are programmed genetically, which allows you to remote control your brainactivity with light.> > The technique involves the genetic modification of neurons to make them> > produce opsins – light-sensitive proteins that are normally made in> > photoreceptor cells in the eye and in some micro-organisms.

What was once science fiction is rapidly becoming reality, and it isgoing to change the world forever.Too good to be true, right? According to an article in the Wall Street Journal,the typical procedure is very quick and it often only requires just an overnightstay in the hospital:> > Neural implants, also called brain implants, are medical devices designed to> > be placed under the skull, on the surface of the brain.

Right off the bat, corporate mediais telling us how to interpret neural implants. Sounds like a “High Tech forDummies ‘How To’ guide.”You are being told what to think and how to interpret the information. Ofcourse, in order to interpret it “correctly” you must have the right mindset.And, in order to get the unsuspecting public into the right mindset for thegovernment’s sinister plans, they need the official blessing of the leadingmainstream corporate media publications. How?For example, the Wall Street Journal reports that:> > These tools aren’t sinister. They’re being created to solve real problems.> > Simply put, prosthetic limbs help people move, and neural implants help> > people think…. The technology can give us brains and brawn. All we have to> > do is let the devices under our skin.One of the poster boys for the entire Transhumanist movement is a now fallenangel, South African athlete, Oscar Pistorius, who happens to have had both ofhis legs amputated below the knee. The mind-benders and paradigm-shift plannersused the London Olympics, the world’s greatest sport’s venue to showcase theirbig idea. Using upside down question mark-shaped carbon fiber sprintingprosthetics, called Cheetah blades, Mr. Pistorius, became one of the mostrecognized athletes in the world. This was not an accident.Buried deep in the Wall Street Journal article is your classic definition ofeugenics and selection of the fittest and the richest over the oppressed massesof the great unwashed.> > The dissemination of advanced implantable technology will likely be just as> > ruthlessly democratic as the ailments it is destined to treat.

Those who don’t or who can’t will be left hopelessly behind.You see, there is a lot of money to be made here through legitimate channels andon the black markets. By the way, both channels will be controlled by the samefinancial-political apparatus. Just as the international drug trade anddistribution is controlled by the banking and the military-industrial cartel.Control will be exercised through technology. Integrating technology with humanevolution sounds like such a good idea, at first. “You are building a betteryou. It is a business that’s driven by fear.

We are atthe bottom, but if we all wake up and realize that this is not our system, onlythen can it be changed.Human experiments? What is immortality? What does it mean to be immortal? Wheredoes it end? The end of the human species?But technology doesn’t end there:> > Intel is working on sensors that will be implanted in the brain that will be> > able to directly control computers and cell phones.

But so is the potential for abuse. Throughinteraction, implantable microchips can “talk” directly to the brain, bypassingthe sensory receptors. This would give a tyrannical government an ultimate formof control.> > If you could download thoughts and feelings directly into the brains of your> > citizens, you could achieve total control and never have to worry that they> > would turn on you.67But, we haven’t even scratched the surface. Called Remote Neural Monitoring,RNM, the technology already in use in the USA, UK, Spain, Sweden, Germany andFrance, allows them to see through your eyes, hear your thoughts, and uploadphotos and scents into your brain as real as if you saw or smelled it in thenatural environment. Needless to say, the perpetrators can hear what you hear because you become aunit of the mainframe. They can change your behavior, affect memory functionsand emotions. This is not a plotline of a dystopian novel. This is real and itis being implemented today, every day by the governments who profess to protectus from evil.In fact, you could potentially program these chips to make your citizens feelgood all the time: The ultimate goal of Huxley’s scientific dictatorship withouttears – soma personified. The future is now.Instead of drugs like cocaine and marijuana giving you a natural high, orshooting you to the Moon, you could have these chips produce a “natural high”that never ends. Drug dependency replaced by a fully government sanctioned chipdependency.

Indeed, it is.Thought Crime PoliceJohn St. Clair Akwei, a former National Security Agency employee andwhistle-blower exposed the use of neural monitoring to spy on individuals.69This is a key area involving mind-invasive technologies that are playing a rolein the uncovering and punishment of “Thought Crime.”NSA, the National Security Agency is America largest and most powerfulorganization.> > The Signals Intelligence mission of the NSA has evolved into a program of> > decoding EMF waves in the environment for wirelessly tapping into computers> > and tracking persons with the electrical currents in their bodies.> > How is it being done?

CPF to the XXI century are what atomic weapons wereto the XX century. The effect of these weapon systems is far more deadly, albeitinvisible to the naked eye. Mind control via non-lethal weapons.The psychotropic weapon at its most diabolical is a directed energy systeminstalled in outer space that can influence the brain and the central nervoussystem: changing the mental, emotional and behavior functions of the person.> > The majority of them operate in a wave band of a brain, modifying> > consciousness, a physical and mental condition of the person. Through> > psychotropic weapons, behavior of the entire world’s population or specific> > regions of the earth can be controlled in a precise and deliberate way.> > Neurophysicists have discovered that they can model the vibratory patterns> > of psychotropic chemicals like LSD. When scientists project these carefully> > shaped sonic vibrations onto the human brain, they can induce altered states> > of mind, exactly as if they were injecting the person with a drug.

It means that electro-magnetic beam weapons can be> > used to ‘drug’ people against their will. Beam weapons can be used remotely,> > at a distance. When combined with space-based satellite systems, such beam> > weapons could potentially drug entire populations, en masse.”71How is it done?Let’s start by saying that every object on this planet has an electricalfrequency called Hertz (Hz). Our brain, for example, operates on electricalcurrent. Our body is a radiant machine “in which there are complex biochemicalprocesses with a range of frequencies from 0-100 Ggz. So bodies work inlow-frequency area 0-50 Gz, the groups of cells forming fabrics, in kilogerz arange, cells ‘communicate’ in a millimetre wave band 40-70 Ggz. Energyinformation the exchange of chemical and biological and wave character inside anorganism and with an environment is carried out by genetic program DNO andnervous system.> > The most universal target for psychophysical weapons is the brain of the> > person which adjusts functioning all systems of an organism, carries out> > thought processes and defines behaviour of the person. The brain works in a> > range of 4 kinds of ‘brain waves.’> > The most part of day the brain works in a range Beta waves 14-20 gz. There> > are three more such as ‘brain waves’: the Alpha wave 8-13 gz – perception of> > training, an easy relaxation. Theta waves 4-7 gz – ideas, images,> > programming of subconscious, a deep relaxation, meditation. Delta waves> > 0-3gz – dream, dreams, make active of immune system. Ranges of own> > fluctuations of a brain of the person, and also organs, substance and cells> > were taken into account by development psychophysical weapons.> > The psychophysical weapon includes:> > The psychotropic weapon – the pharmacological means of chemical and> > biological character having a range of own fluctuations, equivalent to> > rhythms of a brain and the central nervous system, and thereof influencing> > functioning of a brain.72A Member of the Russian Federation of Space Exploration Scientific and TechnicalCouncil, Anatoliy Ptushenko, states emphatically that psychotropic weapons:> > Do not enable the individual human mind to be controlled in a precise and> > purposeful way. They simply ‘jam’ any internal connections responsible for a> > person’s self-control, and he becomes easily controllable ‘according to mob> > law’ in line with commands form a space-based station. He can be controlled> > either from earth or from a command center lost in space.”How are they to be used?I quote from a scientific paper on the subject taken from October 1996 editionof Armeiskii Sbornik (Moscow):> > The advanced global satellite communications at low altitude Teledesic is of> > special interest. It will have 15 times more satellites Iridium-840.

This is something unprecedented: the numerical size of the Iridium> > orbital grouping enables at least the simultaneous irradiation of any point> > on Earth from two spacecraft.

Evolution has honed it over millions of years to do a> > fantastic job at certain things, such as pattern recognition and fine> > control of muscles.

It’s a matter of time.74Rodney Brooks, founder of MIT’s Humanoid Robotics Group agrees:> > I, you, our family, friends, and dogs – we all are machines.

It is the accumulation of such knowledge> > for practice, in this way, from generation to generation, which defines the> > provable evidence of the absolute difference between man and beast.75And for that matter between man and a machine.With everything you have read here, think about the following: How often have wechased the dream of progress only to see that dream perverted? More often thannot, haven’t the machines we built to improve life, shattered lives of millions,destroyed our ability to love, aspire or make moral choices – the very thingsthat make us human? It also risks giving a few men the power to make others whatthey choose – regardless of the cost to human dignity.Life extension, singularity and the promise of the golden age. Are we to believein such a thing? Or are we being led down the proverbial road to Hell? Posthuman, a word not to be taken lightly, as it implies the end of the human race.Who has the authority to make such a decision? Only a God, or a power thatbelieves itself to be a God can take such action.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------1 Bill Clinton, New Year’s Eve speech, December 31, 1999.2 NBIC, x.3 NBIC, p xii.4 Sarif industries.5 Film: Prometheus.6 Aaron Dykes, “United Nations Envisions Transhumanist Future Where Man isObsolete,” Infowars.com, June 10, 2012.7 Russia 2045.8 Ibid.9 Tal Brooke, Avatar, A New Dawn,http://www.scp-inc.org/publications/journals/J3402/index.php.10 “Upload Your Brain Into A Hologram: Project Avatar 2045 - A New Era ForHumanity Or Scientific Madness?

I lookaround me and ask myself again and again, what does it mean to be human? “Closeproximity to a majestic mountain is a mixed blessing,” noted Edward Said, “Oneis at once graced by the magnanimity of its pastures and the bounty of itsslopes,” and yet one can never see where one is sitting, under the shadow ofwhat greatness, or the embracing comfort of what assurance.Are we, as a human race, in danger of extinction? If yes, then from whom?Against the backdrop of breathtaking technological development, the urge tochange oneself, to upgrade oneself, to transmogrify oneself into somethingbetter, superior, more durable, immortal … against the backdrop of unique humanfragility.We have gone from meaningless generalizations, from the banalities andsimplistic extrapolations of early science fiction novels about deep seamonsters, electric submarines, and a space cannon Moon landing tonanotechnology, robotics, cybernetics, artificial intelligence, life extension,brain enhancement, brain-to-brain interaction, virtual reality, geneticengineering, teleportation, human-machine interfaces, neuromorphic engineering.It won´t be long before we compete with God on equal terms for immortality.Much of what I have written in this book does not have a conclusion or anending, happy or otherwise, because, self-evidently, the future has not happenedyet. What is beyond any doubt is, when we extrapolate what we know about thisworld, about the technology and about technological progress, we can make fairlyaccurate predictions of what to expect of the world.Despite the tendency of people to confront the challenges of the future on theirown terms, without the context of history and human experience, I make no suchattempt in this book.As John Gray has said, “People who worry about problems that others are notworrying about are irritating and are disparaged after the event. People whowere right when others were wrong are even more irritating.”I am convinced that the future will happen as a result of long-wave themes anddevelopments that unite the past, the present and the future. However, oneconstant evident in history – the power of contingency and surprise – willcontinue to dominate our future, which will be influenced and punctuated byunexpected events, startling surprises, major discontinuities and the pervasiveoperation of chance. And in all of it, we, the people, shall remain history’smain protagonists.Let me say it another way: Parts of the projected landscape are unlikely tosurvive first contact with the future, mainly and inconveniently because of thetendency of human beings to interfere with the scenery and to act and react inunforeseen, non-linear ways. Again, the pesky humans are getting in the way. Godbless us for that!Taken together, I believe that this work provides a complex, but readilydiscernible tapestry of possible outcomes, a solid map, to help you navigate thetreacherous waters of uncertainty that awaits us in the very near future.We stand at the threshold of a new renaissance in science and technology, basedon a comprehensive understanding of the structure and behavior of matter fromthe nanoscale up to the most complex system yet discovered – the human brain.Will our quest for immortality over-shadow the values that make ushuman? Willour desire to be free overcome the elites’ drive for complete control? I don´tknow, but it won’t take us long to find out.Daniel EstulinMay 6, 2013"},{"pageContent":"Internet LinksChapter One — ECONOMYhttp://larouchepac.com/node/26884
