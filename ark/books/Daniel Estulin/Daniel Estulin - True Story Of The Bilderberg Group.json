I’ll get a call; ahardy-timbred voice at the other end ot the line says, “My book is going tochange the world and ... be a best-seller” Trying not to burst his bubble, butby giving the short-list of particulars about the book biz, and by relating thewar stories of trying to break “inconvenient” truths, I gently try to introducesome reality into the long-shot dream.Well, here is a book that has already changed the world and is already abest-seller. Daniel Estulin’s dogged pursuit of what the world’s political andfinancial leaders have been talking about at their annual secret conclaves — theBilderberg Group meetings — has lead to astounding revelations, spot-onpredictions of world events and a scrambling feverish attempt to blot out thelight that Daniel has shone inside the shroud of secrecy: where world events areplaythings. Presidents are chosen, wars formatted, energy markets manipulated,and more ... all with major press attending, but never reporting.Looking into secret matters is never easy, nor is dealing with the bias one mustslog through. The mainstream media have, until recently, barely mentioned theGroup. Meanwhile, the Bildergerg Group has become a bogeyman of the fringe,where their reputation may, in fact, be well deserved.We have done our best to be accurate; rosters are fluid. Boards of Directorschange, etc. To me, the real questions are: “What are these wise men doing thatdemands such extreme secrecy?” and, “Where are they taking us?”When the Group’s actions are put into historical context, as Daniel has done,one can begin to understand the apparent scope of what “they” intend, and whythey need such a high level of hush to implement it. That there are such thingsas national and personal sovereignty, and the attendant human freedoms andliberties standing in the way of their stated objectives, seems of littleconsequence to them.I stand with Daniel and most people of the world for the true democratic idealsof our Republic, not the current cryptocratic rule “of the elite, by the stoogesand for the corporations.” 1 am sure that most of the Bilderberg Group feel thattheir stealthy road to a secret future has been paved with good intentions. But,it just may be that many of us, like myself, don’t really want to go to ...there.Kris Millegan,PublisherSeptember 22, 2007AcknowledgmentsT his may be the most difficult part of the book to write, because the list ofcollaborators, independent researchers, in and out of government sources,private investigators, U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force analysts, Spanish Generals,cooks, chefs, bellboys, cleaning persons, waiters and waitresses at Bilderbergerhotels, who have wholeheartedly given of their energies and time, overlookingthe dangers that such meetings could cause them, is simply too long to mentionon the pages of my book, or rather our book, because I am the vehicle of thecollective psyche of a society whose natural instinct spells freedom.I extend my sincerest and deeply felt gratitude to numerous members ofinternational secret service agencies in Washington, London, Moscow, Madrid,Paris, Caracas, Rome and Ottawa, whose inside knowledge on intelligence issuesand wisdom often kept my spirits up in the darkest of hours. Without theirpriceless intelligence gathering, this book would have forever remained anunrealisable dream.Special thanks go out to Canada, my country, who gave our family home and hopefor a better future without asking for anything in return. I repaid that debt ofgratitude in 1996 when I uncovered the Bilderberger’s diabolical plans forCanada’s breakup. My love goes out to Canada’s wonderful and decent and freedomloving people who that fateful year answered my desperate plea for help bytaking to the streets en masse to resoundingly destroy Bilderberger hopes ofsilently breaking up Canada. When I need uplifting, I think of these people andtheir faith in the goodness of Men.A note of gratitude to the good Fortune and infinite Faith, who have never leftmy side, who kept me ploughing away one centimeter at a time, even when therewas no hope and no energy to spare. In the most desperate of moments I made itthrough because I believed in my two Fs.Thanks to my friend John Ffarraghy and his wisdom — a man who belongs to anunrepeatable generation of truly great men — and to Geoffrey Matthews fromAmherst Island, Ontario, Canada, the man who for years has been at the helm ofthe best newspaper in the country, the legendary Eye Opener. To all those kind,faceless people who have sent me tens of thousands of emails making me believethere were some things to look forward to in life.I dedicate this book to all those who have never stopped searching for thetruth, in the face of government lies, cheating, manipulation and deceit. Tothose who have intuitively felt that blasphemous lies we are told are but a vilewhiff of hatred. All these people deserve to know the truth about our historyand heritage. History teaches by analogy, not rigorous proof The historicalexperience is not one of staying in the present and looking back. Rather it isone of going back into the past and returning to the present with a wider andmore intense consciousness of the restrictions of our former outlook.Finally, I owe the success of this book to Bonnie Toews, my first editor of thismanuscript, and to TrineDay’s own Russ Becker, without whose vision and surehand this book would have been a pale version of its present, better self Andfinally, to Kris Millegan. Kris, you defended this work and the truth, and theentire world owes you a debt of gratitude. Your belief that this book wasimportant convinced others. They believed because you believed. And I believedbecause I saw you believe.Mankind is yet to pass a final judgment. Miracles, as someone said, can happenwithout our permission. This book and all the people who made it happen areliving proof of that.Daniel Estulin July 4, 2007Bilderberg Meetings Since 19541. May 29-31, 195*1: Oosterbeek, Netherlands2.

For an entire weekend,they debated the future of the world. When it was over, they decided to meetonce every year to exchange ideas and analyze international affairs. They namedthemselves the Bilderberg Group. Since then, they have gathered yearly in aluxurious hotel somewhere in the world to try to decide the future of humanity.Among the select members of this club are Bill Clinton, Paul Wolfowitz, HenryKissinger, David Rockefeller, Zbigniew Brzezinski, Tony Blair and many otherheads of government, businessmen, politicians, bankers and journalists from allover the world.Nevertheless, in the more than fifty years of their meetings, the press hasnever been allowed to attend, no statements have ever been released on theattendees’ conclusions, nor has any agenda for a Bilderberg meeting been madepublic. Leaders of the Bilderberg Group argue that this discretion is necessaryto allow participants in the debates to speak freely without being on therecord, or reported publicly. Otherwise, Bilderbergers claim, they would beforced to speak in the language of a press release. No doubt, this discretionallows the Bilderberg Group to deliberate more freely. But that does not respondto the fundamental question: Wliat do the world’s most powerful people talkabout in these meetings?Any modern democratic system protects the right to privacy, but doesn’t thepublic have a right to know what their political leaders are talking about whenthey meet the wealthiest business leaders of their respective countries? Whatguarantees do citizens have that the Bilderberg Group isn’t merely a center forinfluence trafficking and lobbying if they aren’t allowed to know what theirrepresentatives talkThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupabout at the Group’s secret gatherings? Why are the Davos World Economic Forumsand G8 meetings discussed in every newspaper, given front-page coverage, withthousands of journalists in attendance, while no one covers Bilderberg Groupmeetings? This blackout exists despite the fact that (or because?) they areannually attended by Presidents of the International Monetary Fund, the WorldBank, and Federal Reserve; by chairmen of 100 of the most powerful corporationsin the world such as Daimler Chrysler, Coca Cola, British Petroleum (BP), ChaseManhattan Bank, American Express, Goldman Sachs, and Microsoft; by VicePresidents of the United States, Directors of the CIA and the FBI, SecretariesGeneral of NATO, American Senators and members of Congress, European PrimeMinisters, and leaders of opposition parties; and by top editors and CEOs of theleading newspapers in the world.It is certainly curious that no mainstream media outlet considers a gathering ofsuch figures, whose wealth far exceeds the combined wealth of all United Statescitizens, to be newsworthy, when a trip by any one of them on their own makesheadline news on TV. This is the conundrum that I have pondered. Fifteen yearsago it set me on an investigative journey that has become my life’s work.Slowly, one by one, I have penetrated the layers of secrecy surrounding theBilderberg Group, but I could not have done this without the help of“conscientious objectors” from inside, as well as outside, the Group’smembership. To them, I extend my deepest gratitude for their pricelessintelligence has made this book possible. You can understand then, that toprotect them, I cannot mention these true heroes by name, only thank them forhelping me find out what was being said behind the closed doors of the opulenthotels where the Bilderbergers hold their annual meetings.Before we enter the realm of this exclusive club, it is important to recognizethat neither people nor organizations are absolutely “evil,” just as no one isabsolutely “good.” There are powerful people in the world guided by higherideals, principles and beliefs than those of the manipulative secret club andits spin-offs that I describe in this book. The efforts of the original membersto better our world were based on a “father-knows-best” autocracy similar to theRoman Catholic Church’s paternalistic form of Christianity. Their intent wasnoble, at first.Unfortunately, it seems that the Bilderberg Group has grown beyond itsidealistic beginnings to become a shadow world government, whichIntroductiondecides in total secrecy at annual meetings how their plans are to be carriedout. They threaten to take away our right to direct our own destinies. And thisis becoming easier, because the development of telecommunication technology,merged with profound instant impact of the Internet and new methods of behaviorengineering to manipulate individual conduct, may convert what, at other epochsof history, were only evil intentions — into a disturbing reality.Each new measure, viewed on its own, may seem only a slight aberration, but awhole host of changes, as part of an ongoing continuum, constitutes a shifttowards total enslavement. This is why it is time to look behind the scenes. Weare at a crossroads. And the roads we take from here will determine the veryfuture of humanity. We have to wake up to the true objectives and actions of theBilderberg Group and its parallel kin if we hope to retain the freedoms foughtfor by our grandfathers in World War II.It is not up to God to bring us back from the “New Dark Age” planned for us. Itis up to us! Whether we emerge from this century as an electronic global policestate or as free human beings depends on the actions we take now. We will neverfind the right answers if we don’t know the deep context.This is what The True Story of the Bilderberg Group endeavors to provide.XVpicture2 [images/picture2.jpg]Prince Bernhard presiding over first Bilderberf in Oosterbeek, Netherlands, May1954,‘ —— = 'VAn invitation from Prince Bernhard to the 1957 Bilderberg Group meetingSoestdijk Palace, December 1950L£*j\\I have the honour to invite you to the next Bilderberg Conference which willtake place on the 15 th, i 6 th and 17 th February 1957 at St. Simon’s Island,Georgia, in the United States of America.The object of this conference will be to study common and divergent elements inthe policies of the Western World.picture3 [images/picture3.jpg]27, The Vale, LONDON S.

It felt good to be back,and 1 was reminded of so many reasons why 1 love this country.Toronto, home to over five million people, is the largest financial center inCanada and the fourth largest city in North America. Only New York, Chicago andLos Angeles have larger economies. The Toronto Stock Exchange is here. It is thethird largest in North America in trading value, ninth in the world in quotedmarket value, and it has the first fully computerized trading system in NorthAmerica.Within an hour’s drive of Toronto are the greatest concentrations of automobilemanufacturing and horse breeding in the country. 1 would be heading north to thesite of this year’s Bilderberg Conference in a short while, but first 1 wantedto enjoy wandering through the city streets, reacquainting myself with thewonderful sights so many Canadians take for granted.Downtown, in the heart of Toronto’s financial district, is Bay Street, which isToronto’s diminutive version of New York’s famous Wall Street. At 161 Bay Streetstands the Canada Trust Tower. This 53-stoiy, 856-foot tower is one of thecity’s signature skyscrapers, and it has fascinated me since its construction in1990 by a famed Spanish architect, Santiago Calatrava. This tower forms part ofthe 5.2 acre BCE Place, the second most distinctive sight on Toronto’s skyline,after the CN Tower which, at 1,820 feet above the ground, is the world’s highestfreestanding structure.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupBCE Place is actually several buildings connected by a shopping mall, but from askyline perspective, it is the Canada Trust Tower and its sister, the BayWellington Tower, that steal the show. With tinted green windows and myriadjagged edges, the two towers present an artistic impression of staggered Legoblocks stacked at angles to defy gravity, giving the pair uniqueness amongToronto’s more sedate skyscrapers.Another jewel in the BCE crown is the Galleria, a five-story hall of light thatruns along Front Street and faces south toward the waterfront district. TheGalleria was designed as a “Crystal Cathedral” of commerce, with the roofproviding cover for the Street Gallery, which connects Bay Street to HeritageSquare. Also designed by Santiago Calatrava, it is 85 feet high, 46 feet wide,and 394 feet from end to end, and is composed of eight freestanding steelsupports on either side of the Gallery. They branch out into parabolic shapes,which at that moment reminded me of a forest canopy.Eventually I strolled up Yonge Street — the world’s longest street, almost 1,200miles long. Just up the road, 22 miles north by northwest of the downtown core,the Bilderberg elite were gathering at the CIBC Leadership Centre near thepristine town of King City, the site of the 1996 Bilderberg Conference. The CIBCretreat/resort is in King Township — a region of large, expensive horse farms,where members of the British Royal Family are hosted on their private visits toCanada. This marvellous center, privately owned by one of Canada’s main banks,the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, includes over three miles of naturetrails through forested terrain and rolling hills.It was no wonder that the Bilderbergers had decided on this exquisite location.From spa facilities and services featuring massage and skin-care/aesthetictreatments, saunas, and steam-rooms; to a unique 200-meter indoor fully heatedtrack suspended roughly six feet above the ground; to indoor and outdoorswimming and whirlpools, the CIBC Leadership Centre has it all. It is alsolocated near numerous golf courses, riding stables, hiking and cycling routes,museums and other recreation sites. In sum, there was little chance that theBilderbergers would get bored.The Toronto media and news services had been first alerted to this meeting by aseries of faxes, phone calls and memos from me and JimDeadly DropTucker, especially after it became known to me from deep undercover sourceswithin the meeting that the 1996 conference was alledgedly to be used as astaging ground for the imminent breakup of Canada. This was to be securedthrough a Unilateral Declaration of Independence in Quebec, to be launched inearly 1997. The declaration would fragment Canada, with the aim of achieving“Continental Union” with the U.S. by 2000, a date which has been pushed back atleast twice since then.As a general rule, Bilderberg meetings are never mentioned in the media, sincethe mainstream press is fully owned by the Bilderbergers. But the veil ofsecrecy was abruptly torn off on May 30, 1996, the first day of the conference.A front-page story ran in one of Canada’s most widely read and influentialnewspapers, the Toronto Star. Under the headline “Black Plays Host To Wori.dLeaders,” John Deverell, a business reporter for the newspaper, noted that notonly had Canadian publisher [Lord] Conrad Black offered $295 million to gaincontrol of Canada’s largest newspaper chain and then weathered the subsequentannual meeting of his Hollinger Inc., but also, to cap his week, he was now “thehost for a four-day, closely guarded meeting of world leaders and royalty justnorth of Toronto.”Deverell named some of the more than 100 hand-picked attendees from around theworld from the list we had supplied him: “U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry;Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada; former U.S. Secretary of State HenryKissinger; Giovanni Agnelli, Honorary Chairman of Fiat; Finance Minister [andlater Canada’s Prime Minister] Paul Martin; Mario Monto, European Commissioner;David Rockefeller of Chase Manhattan Bank; George Soros, Prince of Belgium, thequeens of the Netherlands and Spain as well as other business, political andacademic elite.”That same day, the Toronto Sun headlined, “Big Hitters Gather: Vast Array OfInternational VIPs Talk Things Over At Secretive Bilderberg ’96 In King City,”and noted that “[Conrad] Black, media baron and chairman of Hollinger Inc., andother permanent members of the group, are unhappy at suggestions by extremistsof the left and right that the private event is part of a system of secretgovernment.”At 7:45 that morning, 680-NEWS’ legendary radio journalist, Dick Smythe, who hadthe widest metro Toronto audience, presented theThe True Story of the Bilderberg Grouptollowing report, which was re-aired at intervals as part of the station’s newsschedule:Dick Smythe: Well, this sounds like the plot from a conspiracy movie, as theworld’s movers and shakers meet in secret. Conrad Black is holding his annualBilderberg Conference. Here’s 680’s Karen Parsons ...Reporter: About one hundred notables, including the Queens of the Netherlandsand Spain, along with Henry Kissinger, the U.S. Defense Secretary William Perryand our Prime Minister, have gathered for the conference. Also along, the headsof Ford Motor Company, Xerox, the Bank of Commerce and Reuters.Black says there is a ban on reporters, so discussion will be intimate andcandid. He says, “Exchanges can often be quite heated.” Participants arerequired to take a vow of silence. Last year’s conference was held in threemountaintop luxury hotels in Switzerland.This year, it’s at a $60 million dollar luxury spa in King City. The CanadianPress has also distributed a brief report on the previously-secret meeting,which was published today by, among other newspapers, the Toronto Sun, with over350,000 subscribers.This was the first time in the history of the Bilderberg Conferences that theyhad ever been scrutinized in such a fashion. Bilderbergers \\ are not accustomedto having to provide explanations to anyone, particularly sinc e members own orcontrol major metropolitan newspapers, newspaper chains and wire services.However, 1996 was no ordinary conference. The Bilderbergers do not typicallyplot the overthrow of their host country’s government during their meetings.When the principal news outlets began checking our information through their owngovernment and private sources, it became clear that Canada, one of the world’swealthiest countries, was scheduled to be ruthlessly partitioned by theBilderbergers and the New World Order. They should have known that when theirown freedom is at stake, no amount of ownership of the press would preventsecretaries, copy editors, writers, investigative journalists and, indeed,management ofDeadly DropCanada’s television, radio and print media from disseminating the truth forpublic consumption.The press coverage became so intense that Kissinger was overheard by one of thestaff reporters screaming at the Canadian Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, that hewould be damned if someone was going to screw this up for him. David Rockefellerpulled Conrad Black aside during a break to ask him if he could “lean” on somepeople in the press to get them to “shut up about this.” Even then, the nowdisgraced and bankrupt Conrad Black was in way over his head.What the Bilderbergers imagined being a trickle had quickly turned into a floodand then an avalanche. Not until the 1999 Conference in Sintra, Portugal, didthe Bilderbergers relax the extraordinary security measures that followed in thefootsteps of their worst defeat, the 1996 Conference in Toronto.On June 1, “Big Jim” Tucker and 1, along with a small cadre of part-timeBilderberg chasers, celebrated what was turning into an extraordinary successstory. Every major newspaper in the country wanted an interview, televisionstations were constantly looking for updates, and radio stations were followingus all over the city.We gathered at the Horseshoe Tavern on Queen Street, Toronto’s version of NewYork’s Soho district. The Horseshoe Tavern, now some 60 years old, is one*of thecity’s original music venues, the famous bar where Canadian singing legendsStompin’ Tom, Blue Rodeo, The Tragically Hip and The Watchmen got their firstbreaks. In September 1997, the Rolling Stones would kick off their No Securitytour there, with a 75-minute show for “Live on MTV.” It is a good place to havea good time, and we felt well deserving of it.As the festivities began to wind down, I pondered my approaching appointment,made during a phone call from one of my sources, who wanted urgently to see mebefore the end of the conference scheduled for the following day. We had agreedto meet in less than an hour at Calatrava’s Galleria. BCE Place is one of themost inconspicuous places in all of Toronto precisely because of its immensity,with droves of tourist gawkers passing through the premises photographing andvideotaping the sights and sounds of Toronto’s premier architectural attraction.Our party was now definitely breaking up, and 1 decided to walk to the Galleriathrough Kensington Market, a Toronto version of Madrid’sThe True Story of the Bilderberg GroupR^istro, located just west of Chinatown. It was Saturday, which is the busiestday of the week, when it becomes a bustling open-air market. If anyone were tofollow me, I would surely lose the tail in this matrix of busy streets anddensely packed crowds.As I rounded the corner at the Galleria, I could see my contact browsing thenewspaper stand, a plastic bag in left hand and his other holding a rolled upmagazine. After a chance eye contact, and without acknowledging each other’spresence, we moved silently towards the revolving entrance of the adjacentCanada Trust Tower, where a friend who worked for the real estate developer hadarranged a room overlooking the city skyline on one of the top floors.I walked into an elevator, nervously glancing behind me. My contact was tofollow me five minutes later. As I entered the posh suite, the splendor of oneof North America’s most beautiful cities opened up and stood majestically beforeme. From 800 feet above ground, the city stood still. I was shut off from thebustle and sounds of this great metropolis by soundproof windows.The Canada Trust Tower is an architectural marvel where a square meter of spacerents out for 160 Canadian dollars. The building is equipped with 24-hour CCTVsurveillance cameras, 24 elevators, eight levels of underground parking, sevensecurity guards at the entrance, plus undercover police. The skyscraper is hometo some of the most established and successful multinational corporations in theworld.All of a sudden, I once again felt on the outside looking in. Would all thiscontinue to make a difference? Would people wake up to the imminent danger? Orwould this, in the longer run, be just another cloak-and-dagger experience?After all, “Have a nice day, son” had been the reply of one passerby, after Ihad patiently explained to him just who was visiting and what they were up to.Nonetheless, much had been accomplished in these last several days. For once, weclearly had the upper hand on the Bilderbergers. Press coverage was tremendous.Kissinger was royally pissed off: definitively a good sign. To their chagrin,attending European royalty were hounded by unwanted press. The plans for theimminent breakup of my adopted country were temporarily put on hold. What els€could one hope to achieve in such a short time?Still, I knew that this was a temporary reprieve. These people would be back,lessons learned and notes taken. They wanted to crush anyDeadly Dropresistance, to rule the world with or without its consent, with guns or butter,without ...My thoughts were interrupted by a discreet knock on the heavy wooden door.“Come in,” I replied, only slightly raising my voice.My Source, wearing leather gloves, slowly crossed the threshold that separatedthe lightly decorated hallway from the heavy art deco of the suite.Contemplating for a moment the extraordinary view of the downtown Harbour Frontarea surrounded by lakeside promenades and landscaped waterfront pathways, hemoved appreciatively toward the window.“You stopped them this time around,” said the Source, weighing every syllable asif even a slight alteration in the register might have transmitted a differentmeaning. Despite his words, he projected an aura of resignation. “The breakup ofCanada will go ahead as planned. It is only a matter of time.”“Maybe,” 1 said. “But all is well, for now, until the next close encounter.Between now and then, quite a few of them will have died of old age, disease andfortuitous accidents.”“Fortuitous? For whom?” replied the Source.He pulled out hand-written notes, or rather scribbles that I despaired ofdeciphering on my own, from the magazine he was tightly gripping with his righthand.“1 thought note taking wasn’t allowed,” I quipped, displaying a full smile athim.“Note taking is discouraged, my friend,” he corrected me.1 glanced at the page. The familiar hand of a fountain pen had left a blotchyimprint here and there, but, overall, 1 realized 1 could understand it. 1 knewquite well the Source’s writing, his faint Ts and crooked Rs, diligently drawnout within the confines of a lined paper. I reflected momentarily upon what thiscourageous person was risking in meeting me and handing me this pricelessinformation.Why weren’t there more people like this in the world? But perhaps there are. Wemay simply not know them, or the personal struggles they may be waging thousandsof miles away. For example, there are the many everyday people who have enabledme to acquire much of my information.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupI would arrive at the site of a Bilderberg meeting several days ahead of them,stay at the same five-star luxury hotel until their security forces along withthe arrival of Bilderberg guests kicked me out one day before the start of theirconference. During my time in the hotel, I would get to know the waitresses,waiters and general staff Those who seemed more open I approached and explainedhow the Bilderberg meeting worked, what this secretive group was about and whatwould take place in the hotel over the next few days. Of course many didn’tbelieve me, but I would beg them not to take me at my word, just to watch whathappened in their hotel and to listen to the conversations of the Bilderbergguests as they served them. Then they could decide if they wanted to be my eyesand ears, for the good of humanity.I was taking advantage of all five-star hotel policies: staff and employees mustspeak a minimum of four languages — English, French, German and one more — toaccommodate guests. They could discreetly eavesdrop and understand most of whatwas discussed through the conference. As days went by, those I approachedwitnessed the police presence, secret service, and secrecy of the attendees, andcame to believe that what I had told them was true. For the few who decided tohelp me, I would designate several local bars where we could meetinconspicuously. This insider, of course, required a more secure meeting place“I have to go,” the Source said quietly without looking up.I mechanically extended my open hand in his direction, but just as the Sourcewas about to clasp it with his outstretched palm, I found myself giving him abear hug instead.“I won’t waste your time thanking you, because no amount of thanks can be enoughfor what you have been doing for us.”The Source looked away. “I have to leave.”“We’ll leave as we came up,” I said, “in five minute intervals. I’ll go downfirst.”“Don’t bother. I left my car in the underground parking. We can take theelevator down together,” replied the Source.Pulling on his leather gloves, he pressed the elevator button. A blue lightshone through its transparent surface. I could hear the whooshing sounds of thehydraulic lift speeding towards us from the bowels of the building at six levelsper second. I turned toward my informant.“When will I see you next?”Deadly DropWith the sound of the bell, the doors opened, and I took a step in thatdirection. “Watch out!!” screamed the Source, grabbing my arm and yanking meback.I stared at the elevator. In front of me, a chilling spectacle ... an emptyelevator shaft with certain death awaiting me some 650 feet below, had theSource lacked the reflexes to pull me back from the abyss.I shuddered all over. Cold chills ran up and down my spine in rapid succession.“The floor,” I muttered, barely perceiving. “Where is the floor?”“We have to get out of here!” said the Source. “Someone has jimmied the system.They have been expecting you!“Listen,” he said. “Don’t take the elevator. It isn’t safe. Walk down the stairsand call the police. When they get here. I’ll take advantage of the moment andtake the elevator down to the garage. Go! Do it now!”Skipping the stairs two at a time, I propelled myself around the stairwellcorners with short pushes of my hands against the walls, galvanized withadrenaline, flying down the stairs in record time. I could feel my heartpounding against my chest wall and gasped for more oxygen. On one of the lowerfloors, I heard the garbled voice of a foreign-born security guard climbing thestairs towards me.“...Er, ...ter, ...mister, sir. Are you all right? What happened? I was calledon the intercom on the second floor ... someone manually to made elevator stop... only in emergency can to do this.”I grabbed the man’s forearm. “Could you please call the police as quickly as youcan?” I said, while catching my breath between every other word. The man pulledout his walkie-talkie, and I could hear a high-pitched voice coming through fromthe other end of the line.I ran on. Five, four, three, two, one ... ground level. I pushed open the heavymetal doors that opened on the main lobby. Two police cruisers were alreadyparked outside. The first onlookers were beginning to gather on the other sideof the revolving entrance doors.“Are you the man who got stuck in the elevator?” asked the Toronto policeconstable, pointing at me with his fat index and middle finger.“Not exactly,” I muttered shaking my head in virtual disbelief “I was about toenter into an elevator that was missing its principle component, the floor.”The cop gave a short cry. A stocky companion with sharp features, clippedmoustache and hairy wrist glanced over.The True Story of the Bilderberg Group“You know, son, you are very lucky to be alive.” The policeman stood with hisknees slightly opened, his shoe tips pointing outwards. “Usually only blindpeople survive these situations. A blind man would never step into an elevatorwithout checking to see if it is there. Most of us take it for granted. When theMafia want someone rubbed out, this is one of their preferred methods.”On June 1, 1996, I was about to turn thirty, too young to die.Fuck them, I thought. This is far from over. We can still win this.I gave the pertinent details to the constable, who looked at me incredulouslyfrom time to time, his eyes focused on the lower part of my face as if he werelip reading.A security guard with an impeccably bald dome and slightly clipped hair asked meonce again if I was all right. Several people on the sidewalk recalled seeing astocky man in his forties walk out of the building some five minutes before thepolice had arrived.A police van and two more policemen on motorcycles pulled up. Yes, yes, the showhad begun. It was the crowd’s turn to take center stage.The wrong people remembered the right things, and vice versa. A fat lady, whorefused a chocolate candy because she was “on a diet,” gave a lurid account ofhow she saw someone, or maybe something, walk, or perhaps stumble.... A streetviolinist remembered two men carrying a medium-sized piano out of thebuilding.... A young lady with a poodle....But whatever these people may or may not have seen of relevance to the crime,their hopes were now to participate somehow. Yes, yes, and participate they did,that large crowd of well-wishers and onlookers and gawkers and charlatans.Put the pen away. The show is over. You sir, downstage, put your glasses backon! Officer, stop scribbling into your pad! Ladies and gentlemen, please, couldI have you all put your personal belongings back into your imaginary suitcasesand leave the premises? The show is over!A tramp stuck a half-eaten cigar into his mouth. A thin dapperish man with longsideburns slowly walked by pretending not to notice, not even turning his head.Two hotdog vendors gloomily pushed their sausages over some tram tracks, backacross the street, shooed away by the beat cop with a deprecatory shake of hishead.Deadly DropI walked the other way, the same way I had approached. The first of June issummer in Andalusia, but here summer was still two months away.A distinctly Russian man with a “hedgehog” haircut walked by hand-in-hand with alady, complaining about the eating habits of someone named Vania. He reminded meof the land of my birth. He also reminded me of the man who had drawn me intoall of this in the first place.ipicture16 [images/picture16.jpg]-iTop: Daniel Estulin trying to take a photograph of Richard Perle past twoprivate security guards at the 2006 Bilderberg meeting in Canada.Bottom; Armed guards making sure the 2004 Bilderberg meeting is private.picture17 [images/picture17.jpg]picture18 [images/picture18.jpg]Chapter TwoTHE HIGHLANDER, 1992M y involvement with the secret society called the Bilderberg Group had begun ona fall day in October 1992, with a telephone call from a Russian emigre based inParis. He had read an earlier story about my family’s plight in a New York-basedRussian daily newspaper, written on the tenth anniversary of our forced exile,and he wished to meet to discuss “a certain matter of great importance.” Severalweeks later, we met at Segovia, a well-known Spanish restaurant in Torontolocated just off Yonge Street.When I made that fateful decision to meet the man whose identity will remainanonymous, but whom we shall simply call “Vladimir,” I entered into a paralleluniverse where red meant go and green meant shoot, and yellow and blue andorange and any other color simply didn’t exist. It was a world utterlycounterintuitive, and unfamiliar to all but a select few who somehow had had abrush or a connection with the underworld of spooks and counter-espionage. Thisparallel world remains unseen in the daily struggles of most of humanity, but,believe me, it is there: a cesspool of duplicity and lies and doublespeak andinnuendo and blackmail and bribery. It is a surreal world of double and tripleagents, of changing loyalties, of professional psychotic assassins, brainwashedblack ops agents, soldiers of fortune and mercenaries, whose primary sources ofincome are the dirtiest and most despicable government-run subversive missions —the kind that can never be exposed.These people spend their entire lives dancing between raindrops and disappearingat the faintest whiff of danger. As much as most peopleThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupwould like to believe that this is only possible in James Bond films, pleasetake my word for it: this parallel universe determines much of what you see,read and hear on a daily basis. To survive in the world of these men, one mustdo it on their terms, and must never judge them for their actions, nor believewhat most of them are prepared to tell you. I have seen professional,award-winning investigative journalists so shell-shocked that they were unableto fathom the truth of what they had just witnessed.In this shadow world, your only real weapon is a highly fine-tuned sixth sense,which may just keep you out of trouble long enough to survive and figure thingsout. When I stepped into that world, I immersed myself in a universe I found soperverse and evil that it has left an indelible mark on my soul. It is the priceof involvement.I arrived at Segovia first, ordered a drink, planted myself in the corneragainst the wall, and waited. Ten minutes later, Vladimir appeared — tall,lanky, elegantly dressed. He had twinkling eyes. As he walked by me, he placedtwo light fingers upon my shoulder, glanced downward and motioned to a waiter.“Whiskey,” he uttered in a hardly noticeable Russian accent, a mark of someonewho had spent a considerable portion of his life abroad. He sat down in front ofme. With a tip of his pen, Vladimir brushed an orange thread off hisheavily-starched white shirt. I realized at once that this was no typicalRussian emigre.“Listen,” he said as he pulled himself closer to the table edge. “How well doyou know the guy who runs this place?”“He is a good friend,” I replied. “That’s why I wanted us to meet here.”He flushed, hastily nodded and looked hopefully at me. Down at the other end ofthe room, an overweight businessman with a Chanel-scented handkerchief tried toseduce a sleek young woman.Vladimir pulled out a heavy, worn black leather briefcase and set it carefullyon his lap. Two barely noticeable clicks opened the lock. With his elongatedthumbs, he carefully pushed it open. It was full of papers that were neatly keptin multi-colored folders. In turn, these had been carefully stored in a falsebottom of his briefcase.Over the course of the next two hours, Vladimir took me through a series ofevents that forever shattered my cozy universe. The documentsThe Highlander, 1992I saw erased all doubts about the veracity of what 1 was hearing and seeing. Hisopenness and honesty, as well as his willingness to answer any questions I threwat him, endeared him to me. It was all there: a Trilateral Commissionorchestrating the removal of the Philippines’ President Ferdinand Marcos;minutes of secret meetings discussing JFK’s assassination; the Club of Rome’sDecember 5, 1980 meeting in Washington, D.C., endorsing and accepting their“Global 2000 Report” — a blueprint for global genocide; the KGB’s “Kissingerfiles”; etc.Nevertheless, before I could fully subscribe to Vladimir’s evidence, I needed tobe sure that this man wasn’t a “honey pot” — an intelligence asset withlegitimate material in hand, set loose by his controllers with the objective ofattracting very dangerous characters to a free-for-all. I was new to the game,and to me black was still black, red was stop, green was go, and amber meantcaution. It took me a long time to get accustomed to the fact that these peoplebrought their own rulebooks to the game. And in order to survive, you had tofollow them.Years later, I found out why Vladimir had come to me. He was a double agent whohad worked for the KGB and MI5. Or was it MIS and the KGB? Somewhere along theline his cover was blown, and he had become desperate. He was in fear for hislife, and when he saw that fateful newspaper article about my family, he hadseen someone who might be able to help: my grandfather, a former KGBcounterintelligence officer.This gambit, Vladimir hoped, just might help him bluff his way back into thegame. He had tried to shake off his controllers, and now they were after him. Heneeded something to trade with those who were trying to silence him. He feltthat I, or rather my grandfather, could be his conduit, as I knew enough presspeople in Toronto to persuade them to run with his story, while my grandfatherstill held enough influence to keep the MIS people at bay.I heard back from Vladimir a week later. Our telephone conversation was insanelyweird. Again, I found myself in that parallel universe, where nothing makessense and every phrase is spoken in code. The only thing that I managed toremember from a barrage of numbers and dates he threw at me was UP AR 340-18-5.My intelligence contacts were able to trace this to a highly classified originalOperation Watchtower, a secret U.S. government drug trafficking operation thatfinanced anti-Comrnunist activities between 1975 and 1984. It also dealt withsurveillance.The True Story of the Bilderberg Group“Maybe he was trying to tell me that he was being watched,” I surmised. I waitedanxiously for him to call back, but he never did.Instead, Vladimir vanished. But that murky universe of secret societies andoff-the-book government operations didn’t. His description of the BilderbergGroup turned my world upside down and changed my life forever. “Bilderberg”became synonymous with a One-World-Government takeover, and that distantparallel universe turned into my area of operations.I converted into one of them, a spook, a spectre, a shade... dancing betweenraindrops and disappearing at the first sight of danger: a shadow dancer. InAmerica, they simply called me “the Highlander.”Chapter ThreeBILDERBERG FOUNDATIONI magine a private club where presidents, prime ministers, international bankersand generals rub shoulders, where gracious royal chaperones ensure everyone getsalong, and where the people running the wars, the markets and Europe say whatthey never dare say in public. This is the Bilderberg Group, and it is the mostsecretive of any organization worldwide. The reason that no one is willing tobreak the group’s conspiracy of silence or stand up to it is revealed in thewords of French broadcaster Thierry de Segonzac: “The Bilderbergers are toopowerful and omnipresent to be exposed.”The secrecy of the Bilderbergers has captured the imaginations of novelists suchas Robert Ludlum and Gayle Lynds. Their books model covert organizations basedon the few facts published about the Bilderberg Group. These novels illustratethe fact that whenever a regime change is needed, anywhere worldwide — whetherthis be based on the need to sustain a welfare state or to correct destabilizingcapital flows — it only happens when a world body of power brokers decides toaddress the issues and posts them on its agenda.’The Netherlands’ Prince Bernhard subscribed to the belief that severe economicdips like the Great Depression could be avoided if responsible and influentialleaders could actually manage world events behind their necessary publicposturing. For this reason, he was asked to organize the Hrst meeting of“like-minded” representatives from all facets of the world’s economic,political, industrial and military realms in 1954. They met at the BilderbergHotel in Oosterbeek, Hollandpicture19 [images/picture19.jpg]The True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupbetween May 29^'' and May 3 b'. At the end of that meeting, the attendees agreedto form a secret association.Most reports contend the original members named their alliance the BilderbergGroup after the hotel where they made their covenant. Author Gyeorgos G. Hatonn,however, discovered that German-born Prince Bernhard was an officer in theReiter SS Corp in the early 1930s and was on the board of an I.G. subsidiary,Farben Bilder. In his book, Rape o/ the Constitution; Death of Freedom, Hatonnclaims Prince Bernhard drew on his Nazi history in corporate management toencourage the “super secret policy-making group” to call themselves theBilderbergers after Farben Bilder, in memory of the Farben executives’initiative to organize Heinrich Himmler’s “Circle of Friends” — elitewealth-building leaders who amply rewarded Himmler for his protection underNational Socialist programs, from the early days of Hitler’s popularity throughto Nazi Germany’s defeat. The royal Dutch family discreetly buried this part ofPrince Bernhard’s background when, after the war, he became a top official inRoyal Dutch Shell, a Dutch-British conglomerate. Today, this rich European oilcompany forms part of the inner circle of the Bilderberg elite.During the first meeting of the Bilderbergers, the founding members drew uptheir mission and their goals. According to one observer, they have continued inthe same vein: “The intention behind each and all of the Bilderberg meetings wasabout how to create an ‘Aristocracy of purpose’ between Europe and the UnitedStates, and how to come to agreement on questions of policy, economics, andstrategy in jointly ruling the world. The NATO alliance was their crucial baseof operation and subversion because it afforded them the backdrop for theirplans of ‘perpetual war,’ or at least for their ‘nuclear blackmail’ policy.”^I will illustrate this amply, as we peel the layers of secrecy away and exposethe Bilderbergers’ true intentions, which incidentally were only too patentlyclear to then-French President, General Charles de Gaulle.In his October 1967 newsletter, Les Documents, Politiques, Diplomatiques etFranaers, political investigator Roger Mennevee analyzed the Bilderbergers’relationship with de Gaulle. He began his report with an astonishing observationthat “all of the FrenchBilderberg Foundationpersonalities who had associated themselves with the Bilderberg Group, such asGeorges Pompidou, Antoine Pinay and Guy Mollet were also the strongest opponentsof Charles de Gaulle’s nuclear policy,” known as the force de frappe. Pompidouwas the Prime Minister. Pinay and Mollet were Ministers in the Frenchgovernment.Why this alliance? Because one of the main objectives of the Group was to submitthe sovereignty of the free nations of Europe to a Bilderberger-controlledBritish-American One World Government, using a nuclear threat as a battering ramagainst the rest of the unwilling world. And in order to control Europe, it wasvital to eliminate France’s nuclear deterrent, even when that deterrent wasvital in containing the Soviet nuclear threat. General de Gaulle’s biographer,Jean Lacouture wrote, “de Gaulle had to establish an incontrovertible positionof strength in Europe against Britain’s free trade orientation toward a NewWorld Imperial Order. This is why France had to be one of the three pillars ofthe free world, as opposed to one of the columns of the European Temple.”^If we analyze the agenda items of Bilderberg meetings since 1954, what standsout remarkably is the attempt to manage and bring under control differences inideology among American and European aristocracies with respect to how these twogroups should go about looting the planet. For example, page seven of the 1955Bilderberg meeting General Report speaks of “removal of misunderstanding andpossible suspicion between the countries of Western Europe and the U.S.A. in theface of dangers, which beset the world.Since 1954, the Bilderbergers have represented the elite and the absolute wealthof all western nations — financiers, industrialists, bankers, politicians,business leaders of multinational corporations, presidents, prime ministers,hnance ministers, state secretaries. World Bank and International Monetary Fundrepresentatives, presidents of world media conglomerates, and military leaders.In September 2005, in a precedent-setting gesture to countermand accusations ofa Bilderberg Group conspiracy, the Group’s seventy-three-year-old chairman.Viscount Etienne Davignon, gave an interview to the BBC’s Bill Hayton. In it, hepresented a more benign purpose for the Group’s private meetings: “I simplythink it’s people who have influence interested to speak to other people whohave influence In a forum that allows them to speak freely and to examine theirdifferencesThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupof opinion without criticism and public debate over their views.” Davignon hasdenied the Bilderbergers want to establish a global ruling class, “because Idon’t think a global ruling class exists.” Instead, he contends, “Businessinfluences society, and politics influences society — that’s purely commonsense. It’s not that business contests the right of democratically electedleaders to lead.”Wars have usually been fought over expanding territory, but in this new era ofglobalization, where business and politics co-depend for survival, economiccontrol dominates. Regardless of the Bilderberg chairman’s claims, there is nodoubt the Group wields economic control over world trade. The fact remains: thepublic is not privy to the proceedings of their annual meetings. They meet insecret to discuss global strategy and reach consensus on a wide range of issues.Such secrecy is suspect, and my goal is to uncloak the Bilderbergers’ secrecyand show how this private club of world leaders and interlocking agencies keepstrying to subjugate all free nations to their rule through international laws,which they manipulate and have the United Nations administer.Bilderberger members “run” the central banks and are therefore in a position todetermine discount rates, money-supply levels, interest rates, and the price ofgold, as well as which countries receive loans. By manipulating money up anddown the business chain, the Bilderbergers create billions of dollars forthemselves. The ideology of money and lust for power drives them.Every U.S. president since “Ike” Eisenhower has belonged to the BilderbergGroup, not that they have all attended the meetings personally, but all havesent their representatives. Another member is now ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair,as well as most of the principal members of the British government. EvenCanada’s high-profile past Prime Minister, Pierre Trudeau, was a member. PastBilderberg invitees are Alan Greenspan, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve;Hillary and Bill Clinton; John Kerry; Melinda and Bill Gates; and RichardPerle.^Also members are the people who control what you watch and read — media baronslike David Rockefeller, Conrad Black (the now disgraced ex-owner of over 440media publications around the world from The Jerusalem Post to Canada’s newestdaily. The National Post), Edgar Bronfman, Rupert Murdoch, and Sumner Redstone,CEO ofBilderberg FoundationViacom, an international media conglomerate that touches virtually every majorsegment of the media industry. They have protected the secrecy of this secretsociety, and this may be why the name “Bilderberg” is new to you.No matter where you look — government, big business and any other institutionseeking to exercise power — their key to control is secrecy. Meetings such asthose of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), theG8, World Trade Organization, World Economic Forum, Central Banks, the EuropeanUnion Council of Ministers and the EU Commission, EU summits, government cabinetmeetings, numerous think tanks, etc. are always conducted behind closed doors.The only possible reason for this is that “they” don’t want you and me to knowwhat they are discussing. That well-worn excuse for keeping things under wraps —“It is not in the public’s interest” — really means that it is not in theinterest of the institutions in power for the public to know what they arediscussing and deciding.Beyond this common reluctance to reveal the proceedings of meetings, the secrecyprinciple extends to the forums and meetings themselves; i.e. by and large, wedon’t even know meetings are taking place, let alone what is being planned anddiscussed in them.^ “There’s the World Economic Forum at Davos inJanuary/February, the Bilderberg and G8 meetings in April/May, and the IMF/WorldBank annual conference in September. A kind of international consensus emergesand is carried over from one meeting to the next. But no one’s really leadingit. This consensus becomes the background for G8 economic communiques; itbecomes what informs the IMF when it imposes an adjustment programme onArgentina; and it becomes what the U.S. president proposes to Congress.”^According to the Bilderberger’s draft document of 1989, their first meeting“grew out of the concern expressed by many leading citizens on both sides of theAtlantic that Western Europe and North America were not working together asclosely as they should on matters of critical importance. It was felt thatregular, off-the-record discussions would help create a better understanding ofthe complex forces and major trends affecting Western nations in the difficultpost-war period.”Lord Rothschild and Laurence Rockefeller, key members of two of the mostpowerful families in the world, personally handpicked 100The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupof the world’s elite for the secret purpose of regionalizing Europe, accordingto Giovanni Agnelli, the now-deceased head of Fiat, who also said, “Europeanintegration is our goal, and where the politicians have tailed, weindustrialists hope to succeed.”“No policy is made here; it is all talk, some of it banal and platitudinous,”said Will Hutton, London editor of The Observer, who participated in the 1997Bilderberg meeting. “But the consensus established is the backdrop against whichpolicy is made worldwide.”^According to founder Prince Bernhard of Holland, as quoted in Alden Hatch’sauthorized biography of the Prince, each Bilderberg attendee is “magicallystripped of his office” upon entering the meeting, becoming “a simple citizen ofhis country for the duration of the conference.” Prince Bernhard, who died in2004, was the father of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands and a close friend andassociate of Britain’s Prince Philip. “When these representatives of the Westernestablishment leave a Bilderberg meeting,” he said, “they carry the Group’sconsensus with them. The high-powered Bilderberg debates are intended to buildunity by resolving differences, and therefore certainly have a significantinfluence on attendees.”Indeed, from the moment the Bilderberg Conference closes, what seems to happen —“almost by accident” — is that the consensus reached in different areas ofdiscussion at the Bilderberg annual meeting are wholeheartedly promoted by theseall-powerful political and commercial interests through the mainstream press,while simultaneously becoming common policy to governing international forces ofseemingly different persuasions.CONt^’ERENCE PrOTOCOEN obody can buy their way into a Bilderberg meeting, although many corporationshave tried.^ The Group’s Steering Committee decides whom to invite — what theGuardian newspaper of London aptly calls a “Bilderberg person,” and theirqualifications haven’t changed in fifty years of secret meetings. Essentially,they look for a One World Order enthusiast and a Fabian Socialist — Fabianistsbelieve in what they describe as “the democratic control of society in all itsactivities.” The key word is control, and control of the individual isBilderberg Foundationbest achieved through global government, a goal Fabianism shares with Communism.According to a source within the Steering Committee, “the invited guests mustcome alone; no wives, girlfriends, husbands or boyfriends. Personal assistants[translation: heavily armed bodyguards, usually ex-CIA and Secret IntelligenceService (SIS aka MI6)] cannot attend the conference and must eat in a separatehall. Not even David Rockefeller’s personal assistant can join him for lunch.The guests are explicitly forbidden from giving interviews to journalists.”To maintain their aura of hermeticism, Bilderbergers book a hotel for theduration of the conference, usually ranging from three to four days, with thewhole building being cleared of all other guests by the CIA and local secretservice to ensure complete privacy and safety for the delegates. All drawings ofthe layout of the hotel are classified, staff is thoroughly vetted, theirloyalty questioned, their backgrounds verified, and political affiliationschecked. Any suspect ones are removed for the duration.During the 1998 meeting, “Police in combat blacks with sniffer dogs search everydelivery vehicle, inside and outside, top and bottom, and then escort it to thetradesmen’s entrance. Armed officers haunt the surrounding woods andsquare-jawed men with secret service earphones guard the entrances. Anyoneapproaching the hotel that did not have a stake in controlling the planet isturned back.”^^The host national government takes care of all the security concerns of theattending guests and their entourage. It also pays the costs of the militaryprotection, the secret service, national and local police presence, as well asall additional private security to protect the intimacy and the privacy of theall-powerful world elite. The attendees are not required to follow theestablished rules and regulations of the host country, such as having to gothrough customs, carrying proper identification, such as passports, which arenot required on Bilderberg visits. When they meet, nobody who is not on the “in”is allowed to come near the hotel. The elite often bring their own chefs, cooks,waiters, secretaries, telephone operators, busboys, cleaning staff and securitypersonnel.The 2004 conference, for example, was held at Grand Hotel des lies Borromees inStresa with “174 stunning rooms that faithfully recreate the Belle Epoque era;Impero or Maggiolini style, lavish drapes, warm, rich colors, fabrics and Muranochandeliers that enhance theThe True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupauthenticity. Most lake-facing rooms enjoy a private balcony, and all bathroomsare tiled in Italian marble and have a whirlpool. Suites are magnificent,boasting fine art, inlaid ceilings, statues, vast whirlpool baths and separateshowers in imperial suites.”**The Bilderberg Group pays for delegate and guest accommodations, which aremodestly priced at 1,200 euros per room. Michelin three-star chefs prepare thefood. In fact, one of the criteria in choosing the hotel is the availability ofthe best and most renowned chefs. The other is the size of the town (always asmall town, away from the spotlights of a big city and curious people). Smalltowns have the added advantage of allowing personal assistants with big guns toset up in full view of everyone with no questions asked. Telephone, room serviceand laundry bills are paid for by the participants.A staff member at the Trianon Palace in Versailles told me in 2003 that DavidRockefeller’s telephone bill ran up to 14,000 euros in three days. According tosources who are also Bilderberg participants, it wouldn’t be extravagant to puta price tag on the four-day “globalist festival” at 10 million euros. This ismore than it would cost to protect the President of the United States or thePope on one of his many international visits. Of course, neither the Presidentnor the Pope is nearly as important as the Bilderberg Group.There are four daily sessions — two in the morning and two in the afternoon,except for Saturdays, when there is only a morning session. On Saturday, betweennoon and 3 P.M., the Bilderbergers play golf, swim, accompanied by their“personal assistants,” go on an organized boat cruise or a helicopter ride.The seating plan is in rotatable alphabetical order. One year, Umberto Agnelli(the now deceased chairman of Fiat) might sit at the front. The next year, KlausZumwinkel, Chairman, Deutche Post Worldnet AG and Deutche Telekom, might takehis place.Each country sends a delegation of, typically, three persons: an industry orbusiness leader, a top-level minister or a senator, and an intellectual or chiefeditor of the leading periodical. The United States has the most participantsbecause of its size. Smaller countries like Greece and Denmark are afforded, atmost, two seats. The conferences usually consist of a maximum of 130 delegates.Two thirds of the attendees are from Europe, and the rest come from the UnitedStates and Canada. (Mexican globalists belong to a less powerful sisterorganization, the Trilateral Commission.)Bilderberg FoundationOne-third of the delegates are from government and politics, and the remainingtwo-thirds from industry, finance, education, labor and communications. Mostdelegates are fluent in English, with French as their second language of choice.Bilderberg Rules of ProcedureT he Bilderberg Group, from its inception, has been administered by a smallnucleus of persons, appointed since 1954 by a committee of “wise men,” which ismade up of a European Chairman, both a European and a U.S. Secretary General,and a Treasurer. The annual invitations, according to a Bilderberger unofficialpress release, are only sent out to “important and respected people who, throughtheir special knowledge, personal contacts and influence in national andinternational circles, can amplify the objectives and resources of theBilderberg Group.”Bilderberg meetings follow a traditional protocol founded in 1919 in the wake ofthe Paris Peace Conference held at Versailles for the Royal Institute ofInternational Affairs (RIIA) based in Chatham House in London. While the name“Chatham House” is commonly used to refer to the Institute itself, the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs is the foreign policy executive arm of theBritish monarchy. According to RIIA procedures, “when a meeting, or partthereof, is held under the Chatham House Rule, participants are free to use theinformation received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of thespeaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed; nof may it bementioned that the information was received at a meeting of the Institute.”The founders of the Bilderberg Group based their meetings on the Chatham HouseRule because this allows people to speak as individuals and to express viewsthat may not be those of their organizations, while encouraging free discussion.“People usually feel more relaxed if they don’t have to worry about theirreputation or the implications if they are publicly quoted.In 2002, the application of the Rule was clarihed and its wording strengthened:“Meetings of Chatham House may be held ‘on the record’ or under the ChathamHouse Rule. In the latter case, it may be agreed with the speaker(s) that itwould be conducive to free discussion that a given meeting, or part thereof,should be strictly private andThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupthus held under the Chatham House Rule. The Chatham House Rule guaranteesanonymity to those speaking within its walls in order that better internationalrelations can be achieved. Chatham House can take disciplinary action againstone of its members who breaks the Rule.”'^The Bilderberg Group has taken this more emphatic rule to heart. Althoughparticipants attest that they attend the Group’s annual meeting as privatecitizens and not in their official government capacity, that affirmation isdubious — particularly when you compare the Chatham House Rule to the Logan Actin the United States, where it is absolutely illegal for elected officials tomeet in private with influential business executives to debate and design publicpolicy.The Logan Act was intended to prohibit unauthorized United States citizens frominterfering in relations between the United States and foreign governments.There appear to have been no prosecutions under the Act in its almost 200-yearhistory. However, there have been a number of judicial references to the Act,and it is not uncommon for it to be used as a political weapon.None of which is to say that private citizens can get away with anything whenvisiting or interacting with foreign countries. They can’t export or sell armsillegally, unless, of course, they belong to the Central Intelligence Agency, inwhich case not only are they allowed to profit from illegal arms and drug salesand influence peddling, but also to interfere in private affairs of independentstates.Among those who have attended Bilderberg Group meetings and flouted the LoganAct: Allen Dulles (CIA); Sen. William J. Fulbright (from Arkansas, a RhodesScholar); Dean Acheson (Secretary of State under Truman); Nelson Rockefeller andLaurence Rockefeller; Gerald Ford (former President); Henry J. Heinz II(Chairman of the H. J. Heinz Co.); Thomas L. Hughes (President of the CarnegieEndowment for International Peace); Robert S. McNamara (Kennedy’s Secretary ofDefense and former President of the World Bank); William P. Bundy (formerPresident of the Ford Foundation, and editor of the Council on ForeignRelations’ Foreign Affairs journal); John J. McCloy (former President of theChase Manhattan Bank); George F. Kennan (former U.S. Ambassador to the SovietUnion); Paul H. Nitze (representative of Schroeder Bank — Nitze played a veryprominent role in matters of Arms Control agreements, which haveBilderberg Foundationalways been under the influence of the RJIA); Robert O. Anderson (Chairman ofAtlantic-Richfield Co. and head of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies);John D. Rockefeller IV (ex-Governor of West Virginia, U.S. Senator); Cyrus Vance(Secretary of State under Carter); Eugene Black (former President of the WorldBank); Joseph Johnson (President of the Carnegie Endowment for InternationalPeace); Henry Ford III (head of the Ford Motor Co.); Gen. Andrew J. Goodpaster(former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, and later superintendent of the WestPoint Academy); Zbigniew Brzezinski (National Security Adviser to PresidentCarter, founder of the Trilateral Commission); Gen. Alexander Haig (onceEuropean NATO Commander, former assistant to Henry Kissinger, and laterSecretary of State under Reagan); and James Rockefeller (Chairman, FirstNational City Bank).Bilderberg meetings are always frank, but do not always conclude with consensus.For the past several years, French, British and Americans have almost come toblows over Iraq. In 2003, then-French Foreign Minister, Dominique de Villepin,openly told Henry Kissinger that if “only the Americans had told them the truthabout Iraq” — that the real reason for the invasion was to gain control of oiland natural gas — perhaps they, the French, “would not have vetoed their UNresolutions. The rest of the world is not stupid, Henry.” According to sourcesat the conference, Kissinger gloomily turned around and walked away.British nationalism is another cause for Bilderberg concern. In 1998 at theTurnburry, Scotland meeting, British Prime Minister Tony Blair was lectured likea naughty schoolboy for not doing enough to bring Britain into the commoncurrency. According to a source of investigative journalist Jim Tucker, “Blairassured Bilderberg members that Britain would join, but he first had to resolve‘political problems’ because of a ‘surge of nationalism’ at home.”In the May 29, 1998 issue of Spotlight—a newspaper of dubious agendas—a Germanwas reported to have told Blair, “You’re a Maggie Thatcher in long pants.” Thiswas a crude reminder that Lady Thatcher had been dumped as head of state by herown Conservative Party on Bilderberg orders and replaced with trapeze artistJohn Major over the same issue.John Williams, in his work. Atlanticism: The Achilles’ Heel of EuropeanSecurity, Self-Identity and Collective Will, states thatThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupsome of the Western elite attend Bilderberg meetings “to polish and reinforce avirtual consensus, an illusion that globalization, defined under their terms —what’s good for banking and big business is good for everybody else — isinevitable and for the greater good of mankind.In a rare description of how Bilderberg Group discussions are structured, one ofthe founding members, Otto Wolff von Amerongen, the Chairman and CEO of OttoWolff GmbH in Germany, noted how each meeting is set up with short introductionsto the chosen topics, followed by a general debate.It’s interesting to note thatvon Amerongen is credited with reviving business ties between Germany and theold Soviet bloc. He served as Bonn’s informal ambassador to Russia, but his pastmay link him to Nazi Germany’s theft of Jewish holdings during World War II.Werner Ruegemer, who co-directed a 2001 television documentary about Otto’sfamily firm, alleged that von Amerongen was a Nazi spy in Portugal, involved inselling shares of stocks stolen from Jews and gold plundered from the centralbanks of European nations that Hitler had conquered. Ruegemer also claimed thatvon Amerongen exported tungsten — a key armaments metal used to harden steel inrifles and artillery — to Germany from Portugal, the only nation still tradingtungsten with Germany through the war.Two other delegates from the 2003 Bilderberg Conference in Versailles, whoprefer to remain anonymous but are believed to be British, explain how eachpanel consists of a moderator and two or three people. Six “panels,” with threemembers in each, lead the discussion. Each panel lasts for approximately twohours. After an introductory speech of about ten minutes, the rest of theparticipants choose when they want to enter into the debate or whether they wantto speak for one, three or five minutes by raising one, three or five fingers.One-minute speakers get to speak first, etc., and then there are discussionquestions lasting for five, three or two minutes. There are no introductorydocuments, and there are no records, although the delegates are required toprepare for the discussions in advance. The initial list of “proposed”participants is circulated as early as January, with the final selection beingmade in March.To avoid infiltrations, the Bilderberg Steering Committee sets the date for themeeting four months in advance, but the name of the hotelBilderberg Foundationis not announced till one week before. At the opening of the meeting, theChairman recalls the Bilderberg Rules of Procedure, and then turns to the firstitem of the agenda. Bilderberg marks all distribution material to its members:“personal and strictly confidential, and not for publication. ”cpicture20 [images/picture20.jpg]Bilderberg regulars Henry Kissinger and Henry Kravis carried on extensivediscussions at Bilderberg 5 2004. Henry's wife, Marie-Josee (shown here withKissinger) is one of the very few wives that regularly attend the meetings. DoKissinger and Kravis make investments based upon their insider knowledge of .Bilderberg discussions and decisions?picture21 [images/picture21.jpg]Chapter FourBILDERBERG BEDFELLOWSI t is important to distinguish between active members who assist annually andothers who are only invited occasionally. About eighty members are regulars whohave attended for many years. Fringe people, who are invited to report onsubjects related to their sphere of influence or professional and academicknowledge, are clueless about the formal structure behind the Bilderberg Group,and remain in absolute ignorance of the Group’s greater goals and universalobjectives. A select few are invited because Bilderbergers think they may beuseful tools in their globalist plan and are later helped to reach very powerfulelected positions. One-time invitees who fail to impress, however, are castaside.The most dramatic example of a “useful recruit” was the obscure governor ofArkansas, Bill Clinton, who attended his first Bilderberg meeting atBaden-Baden, Germany, in 1991. There, David Rockefeller told Clinton why theNorth America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was a Bilderberg priority and thatthe group needed him to support it. The next year, Clinton was electedPresident, and — guess what? — he was a strong proponent of NAFTA.The following list tracks the coincidences between the dates of some majorleaders’ attendance at a Bilderberg meeting and the dates of their subsequentcareer moves:• Bill Clinton: attended the Bilderberg meeting in 1991; won the DemocraticParty’s nomination and was elected President in 1992.The True Story of the Bilderberg Group• Tony Blair: attended the Bilderberg meeting in 1993; became party leader inJuly 1994 and elected Prime Minister in May 1997.• George Robertson: attended the Bilderberg meeting in 1998; appointed NATOSecretary-General in August 1999.• Romano Prodi: attended the Bilderberg meeting in 1999; sworn in as thePresident of Europe in September 1999. His term lasted until January 2005; in2006, Prodi was elected Prime Minister of Italy.The Francois Mitterrand TestO n December 10, 1980, the Bilderberg’s “Committee of 300”ordered the official resurrection of Francois Mitterrand, a socialistdiscarded by the French establishment, as France’s next president.According to John Coleman, whose book. Conspirators’ Hierarchy:The Story of the Committee of300, discusses these events, “Mitterrandwas in the process of being picked up, dusted off and returned to ”16power.Mitterand’s comeback speech expressed his disdain for capitalism: “Industrialcapitalist development is the opposite of freedom. We must put an end to it. Theeconomic systems of the 20th and 21st century will use machines to crush man,first in the domain of nuclear energy, which is already producing formidableresults.”Coleman’s reflections make one shudder: “Mitterrand’s return to the ElyseePalace was a great triumph for socialism. It proved that the ‘Committee of 300’was powerful enough to predict happenings and then make them happen, by force,or by whatever means it took to make its point that it could crush any and allopposition even if, as in the case of Mitterrand, he had been totally rejected afew short days before by a discerning political power group in Paris.”This “discerning political power group,” who rejected Mitterrand, along with alarge segment of his own socialist party, was the far-right National Front ledby Jean-Marie Le Pen, a fixture in French politics who campaigned for tightimmigration controls long before President Jacques Chirac introduced stricterpolicies, which in November 2005 set off rioting in France among unemployedyouth.Bilderberg BedfellowsShaping Turkey s FutureF our days after two Turkish attendees — Gazi Ercel, Governor of the CentralBank of Turkey, and Emre Gonensay, Turkish Foreign Minister — returned home fromthe 1996 King City Bilderberg meeting, the Turkish government fell.In a surprise move, Mesut Yilmaz, Turkish Prime Minister, abruptly quit. Hisresignation effectively dissolved the coalition government patched togetherbetween the True Path Party, led by conservative ex-Prime Minister Tansue Cille,and his centrist Motherland Party. Yilmaz’s resignation cleared the way forNecmettin Erbakan, head of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party, to form the nextTurkish government. This change in government gave the Bilderbergers a goldenopportunity to project Islamic influence into the soft underbelly of ChristianEurope, thus creating ethnic tensions and destabilizing the region.The Portuguese GambitA ccording to a well-informed source, 2004’s Bilderberg meeting in Stresa,Italy, set up wholesale promotion for Portuguese Bilderbergers. Following thatsession, major changes in leadership took place in Portugal.• Pedro M. Lopes Santana, the little-known Mayor of Lisbon was suddenlyappointed Prime Minister by the republic’s president.• Jose M. Durao Barroso, former Prime Minister, was appointed President of theEuropean Commission.• Jose Socrates, Member of Parliament, was elected leader of the Socialist Partyafter Eduardo Ferro Rodrigues resigned May 25, 2003, in a social/politicalcrisis brought on by a police investigation into fifteen cases, allegedlyinvolving him, of sexual violence against minors in state-run foster homesbetween 1999 and 2000. (Sources close to the investigation confirmed to me thatthe crisis was stage-managed from behind the scenes by Bilderberg members.)Socrates became Portugal’s Prime Minister in 2005.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupThe Bilderbergers’ Vice Presidential CandidateI n July 2004, Bilderberg members literally chose Democratic presidentialcandidate John Kerry’s former rival as his running mate, after John Edwards, inhis first-time attendance at a Bilderberg gathering, impressed them with hisvision for American politics. Various sources, whose names I cannot disclose,have independently corroborated that, after hearing John Edwards speak aboutNAFTA during the second day of the conference, Henry Kissinger telephoned JohnKerry with the following comment: “John, this is Henry. We have found your VicePresident.”In another momentary lifting of the veil the New York Times of July 8, 2004 alsosuggested the powerful group’s involvement:Did Bilderbergers Select Edwards?Several people pointed to the secretive and exclusive Bilderberg conference ofsome 120 people that this year drew the likes of Henry A. Kissinger, MelindaGates and Richard A. Perle to Stresa, Italy, in early June, as helping win Mr.Kerry’s heart. Mr.Edwards spoke so well in a debate on American politics with the Republican RalphReed that participants broke Bilderberg rules to clap before the end of thesession. Beforehand, Mr. Edwards traveled to Brussels to meet with NATOofficials, brandishing his foreign-policy credentials.Powerful BuddiesT o understand who controls the leadership of NATO, the world’s largest militaryoperation or today’s World Army, you only have to look at the NATO SecretariesGeneral who have belonged to the Bilderberg Group: Joseph Luns (1971-1984), LordCarrington (’84-’88), Manfred Worner (’88-’94), Willy Claes (’94-’95), JavierSolana (’95-’99), Lord Robertson (’99-’04), Jaap G. de Hoop Scheffer (’04- ).With such military connections, how much easier it becomes to initiateBilderberg policy in areas like the Persian Gulf, Iraq, Serbia, Bosnia, Kosovo,Syria, North Korea, Afghanistan, and so on, with an army under one’s control.As a note of interest, in August 1956, Joseph Rettinger wrote on page 11 of theBilderberg Report that this “group may be a factory of initiative; we decided,however, that none of the new ideas and initiativesBilderberg Bedfellowswould be developed by the group, but that they should be passed on to somepersons or organization who would further develop them.”In fact, during the final day of the inaugural 1954 conference, a proposal wassubmitted (p.8 of the General Report) by the Bilderberg Steering Committeewhereby the European Defence Community would be integrated into NATO with anobjective of serving as a “central organ of decision, capable of action in thepolitical and economic as well as in the military.” Thus, it was decided thatthe Bilderbergers would use NATO to control European affairs.Former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Ireland’s General PeterSutherland (former European Union commissioner and chairman of Goldman Sachs andBritish Petroleum) are active Bilderbergers. In 2000, Rumsfeld and Sutherlandearned a bit of pocket money by serving together on the board of the Swissenergy company, ABB. Their secret alliance became public knowledge when it wasdisclosed that ABB sold two light-water nuclear reactors to an active member ofthe “axis of evil” — North Korea. Needless to say, British Petroleum doesn’tadvertise this when the company promotes its “safety first” public initiatives.Every British Prime Minister for the past thirty years has felt compelled toattend Bilderberg Conferences. In fact, some say the Bilderberg Group is reallya creation of MI6 under the direction of the Royal Institute of InternationalAffairs. “The plan of British Intelligence was to get Joseph Rettinger, whowould later become one of the key founding fathers of the European Movement, toorganize the Bilderberger Group as the real power brokers behind the differentgovernments of Europe and of the United States.”*^According to another observer, “Rettinger [a Jesuit] was funded with secretmoney from the U.S. State Department and kept afloat with massive subventionsthrough Thomas Braden, head of the CIA’s International Organization Division.”*^John Coleman relates in Conspirators’ Hierarchy that the idea came from AlastairBuchan (a board member of the RIIA and a member of the Round Table, as well as ason of Lord Tweedsmuir) and Duncan Sandys (a prominent politician, andson-in-law of the late Winston Churchill), who was a friend of Rettinger’s, andhimself also a Jesuit priest and a 33rd Degree Freemason.The British newspaper The Observer reported the following in its April 7, 1963edition: “These people [Bilderbergers] maintain that theThe True Story of the Bilderberg GroupFuture belongs to technocrats, because the rumour among them is that the gravequestions of international affairs are too delicate to be left in the hands ofdiplomats. However, the ‘clandestinity’ of their debates shows that they onlyseek one thing: effective domination over the peoples of the world, but bydissimulating themselves and by leaving the responsibility of governments in thehands of petty politicians.”The Bilderberg Group may, in fact, be a natural extrapolation of Britain’sCoefficients Club, founded in 1902. Lord Alfred Milner spoke of his vision forthe future during a 1903 meeting at the St. Ermin’s Hotel, over half a centurybefore the Bilderbergers were founded. At that meeting, Milner stressed thepoint:We must have an aristocracy — not of privilege, but of understanding and purpose— or mankind will fail... And here my peculiar difficulty with democracy comesin. If humanity at large is capable of that high education and those creativefreedoms our hope demands, much more must its better and more vigorous types beso capable.And if those who have power and leisure now, and freedom to respond toimaginative appeals, cannot be won to the idea of collective self-development,then the whole of humanity cannot be won to that. The solution does not lie indirect confrontation. We can defeat democracy because we understand the workingsof the human mind, the mental hinterlands hidden behind the persona.We need constructive imagination working within the vast complex of powerfulpeople, clever people, enterprising people, influential people, amidst whompower is diffused today, to produce that self-conscious highly selective,open-minded, devoted aristocratic culture, which seems to me to be the nextnecessary phase in the development of human affairs. I see human progress, notas the spontaneous product of crowds of raw minds swayed by elementary needs,but as a natural but elaborate result of intricate human interdependencies, ofhuman energy and curiosity liberated and acting at leisure, of human passionsand motives modified and redirected by literature and art.‘‘'We can put the words of Lord Milner in perspective better by reviewing whatItalian industrialist, the late chairman of Fiat, Giovanni Agnelli had to say:“European integration is our goal, and where the politicians have failed, weindustrialists hope to succeed.” Indeed they do.If MI6 needed a royal face to give the Bilderbergers public support andpromotional possibilities, then Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands,Bilderberg Bedfellowsknown for his numerous close ties to European Royalty and top industrialists,was an ideal contact-man, and thus was seemingly given the “diplomatic”presidency of the Group. But it was Rettinger who actually managed the groupfrom behind the scenes until his death on June 12, 1960.The 1957 Bilderberg Conference initiated Denis Healey into its. ranks. Britain’sHealey, who is often described as the best Labor politician never elected itsleader (despite standing twice), was a founding member of the so-called“European Movement” promoting understanding and future cooperation of Americanand European politicians, businessmen, top bureaucrats and military leaders. Thegroup received financial support from a New York-based organization, whichcalled itself the “American Committee on United Europe.” Healey did not know itat the time, but the group was a CIA front, whose leadership included GeneralDonovan, wartime head of the OSS (precursor to the CIA), then-Secretary of StateGeorge Marshall and the ubiquitous Allen Dulles. Healey was later appointed asChancellor of the Exchequer, or the British cabinet minister responsible for allfinancial matters, second only to the Prime Minister in power.Many believe I am connecting a remarkable series of coincidences and seeingconspiracy. Perhaps, but the coincidences grow thicker.picture22 [images/picture22.jpg]1 David Rockefeller needsbadges,\" here at Bilderberg 2005Bilderberg Steering ^ Committee ^ member, Peter Sutherland Chairman « of BP andChairman of Goldman Sachs International, Director-General WTO, at Bilderberg20042004, ipiothschild representative Franco Bernabe talks with Henry Kravis, whileRucBard Haass, President of the- Council on Foreign ejat^ons (CFRJ^ talks on thephonej Diplo^at/nvestmei{4 banker RicharJ Holbrooke is in thoback with a glass.picture23 [images/picture23.jpg]Chapter FiveBILDERBERG OBJECTIVESThe Bilderbergers are searching for the age of post-nationalism: when we won’thave countries, but rather regions of Earth surrounded by Universal values. Thatis to say, a global economy, one World government (selected rather than elected)and a universal religion. To assure themselves of reaching these objectives, theBilderbergers focus on a “greater technical approach and less awareness onbehalf of the general public.”-^^—William ShannonT he Bilderberg Group’s chief fear is organized resistance. Members do not wantthe common people of the world to figure out what they are planning for theworld’s future: mainly, a One World Government (World Company) with a single,global marketplace, policed by one world army, and financially regulated by one“World Bank” using one global currency.How the Bilderbergers intend to achieve their One World vision is outlined inthe following “wish list.” They want:• One International Identity. By empowering international bodies to completelydestroy all national identity through subversion from within, they intend toestablish one set of universal values. No others will be allowed to flourish inthe future.* Centralized Control of the People. By means of mind control, they plan todirect all humanity to obey their wishes. The blueprint of their plan ischillinglyThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupdescribed in Zbigniew Brzezinski’s book, Between Two Ages: America s Role in theTechnetronic Era. A man with a Ph.D. From Harvard in 1953 and a Founder oF theRockeFeller-controlled Trilateral Commission, Brzezinski has an impressiveresume. Not only was he Carter’s National Security Advisor, but also a member oFRonald Reagan’s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and co-chair oF George H.W.Bush’s National Security Advisory Task Force in 1988. He is, as well, anassociate oF Henry Kissinger and well known For his presentations to severalBilderberg ConFerences. He Foresees, under the New World Order, no middle class,only rulers and servants.• A Zero-Growth Society. In a post-industrial period, zero growth will benecessary to destroy vestiges oF general prosperity. Wlien there is prosperity,there is progress. Prosperity and progress make it impossible to implementrepression, and you need repression if you hope to divide society into ownersand slaves. The end of prosperity will bring an end to the production olnucleargenerated electric power and all industrialization (except For thecomputer and service industries.) The remaining Canadian and American industrieswould be exported to poor countries such as Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Nicaragua,where slave labor is cheap. One oFthe principal objectives For NAFTA will thenbe realized.• A State of Perpetual Imbalance. By artificially manufacturing crises that willput people under continual duress — physically, mentally and emotionally — it ispossible to keep people in a perpetual state of imbalance. Too tired andstrung-out to decide their own destinies, populations will be confused anddemoralized to the extent that, “faced with too many choices, apathy on amassive scale will result.”^'• Centralized Control of All Education. One ofthe reasons For the European Community, “American Union” and the future AsianUnion to seek greater control of education in general is to allow One WorldBilderberg Objectivesglobalists to sterilize the world’s tr ue past. Their efforts are bearing “fantastic” fruit. ^Today’s youth are almost A ( completely ignorant of the lessonsof history, individual liberties and the meaning of freedom. From the globalistpoint of view, this arrangement simplifies the program.• L-entralized Control ot All Foreign and Domestic Policies. What the UnitedStates does affects the whole world. Right now the Bilderbergers seem toexercise some control over U.S. President Bush and his policies.Canada, while appearing to retain its own sovereignty, marches to U.S. demands.Europe, of course, is now influenced by the consensus of the European• Community.• Empowerment of the United Nations. By using what the United Nations alreadyhas in place, they plan to shape it into a de jure, and then de facto, worldgovernment, and charge a direct UN tax on “world citizens.”• Western Trading Bloc. By expanding NAFTA throughout the Western Hemisphereinto South America, an “American Union” will eventually form, similar to theEuropean Union.• Expansion of NATO. As the UN intervenes in more trouble-spots globally, as itis in Af ghanistan now,^ NATO becomes the UN’s world army//• One Legal System. The International Court of Justice is to become the solelegal system for the world.• One Socialist Welfare State. The Bilderbergers envision a socialist welfarestate, where obedient slaves will be rewarded and non-conformists targeted forextermination.The Bilderberg Group has the power and influence to impose its policies on anynation of the world. We’ve already seen how far-reaching their tentacles are —grasping to control the President of the U.S.A., the Prime Minister of Canada,all the main news media outlets in the free world, all the most importantpoliticians, financiers and media as well as every central banker of every majorcountry, in the world, the U.S. FederalThe True Story of the Bilderberg GroupReserve, thus its money supply, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank,and all the way to the UN. With such connections, they are capable of destroyinganyone, big or small, who gets in the way of their plans to create a One WorldOrder, as I will demonstrate through many hair-raising, and mind-bogglingexamples.For example in Adventures with Extremists (Picador, 2001), Jon Ronson describeshow, during the Falklands War, the British government requested internationalsanctions be implemented against Argentina, but “encountered stiff opposition.At a Bilderberg meeting in Sandefjord, Norway, however, David Owen, British MPstood up and gave the fieriest speech in favour of imposing them. Well, thespeech changed a lot of minds. I’m sure that various foreign ministers went backto their respective countries and told their leaders what David Owen had said.And you know what? Sanctions were imposed.”Alas, this simple and beautiful story of international cooperation amongstnations falls far short of a complete account.Bilderberg Test RunO ne Bilderberg objective is to de-industrialize the world by suppressing allscientific development, starting with the United States. Especially targeted arethe fusion experiments as a future source of nuclear energy for peacefulpurposes. “Development of the fusion torch would blow the Bilderbergerconception of 'limited natural resources’ right out of the window. A fusiontorch properly used could create unlimited untapped natural resources from themost ordinary substances, thus benefiting mankind in a manner, which is, as yet,not even remotely comprehended by the public.Why is nuclear energy hated so much by the New World Order? According to JohnColeman, a former British MI6 secret agent, nuclear power stations generatingabundant cheap electricity are ‘The key to bringing Third World countries out oftheir backward state. With nuclear energy generating electricity in cheap andabundant supplies. Third World countries would gradually become independent ofU.S. foreign aid, which keeps them in servitude, and begin to assert theirsovereignty.”Less foreign aid means less control of a country’s natural resources by the IMF,and greater freedom and independence for the people. ItBilderberg Objectivesis this idea of developing nations taking charge of their own destinies that isrepugnant to the Bilderbergers and their surrogates.This was confirmed on page 13 of the Bilderberg 1955 General Report: “In thefield of atomic energy, scientific discovery was continually overtakingitself.... It could not be excluded that the scientists would put the bomb intothe hands of more and more people and soon ‘the atomic bomb would become the armof the poor.’ The same applied to the development of atomic energy for peacefulpurposes, where we had almost to foresee the unforeseeable.”Nuclear energy, according to the Bilderberger ideals, is not for the poornations of the planet. Rather, it is the definitive weapon to threatenunwilling-to-submit Third and Fourth World nations, as illustrated by theFalklands War.According to my own investigative channels, a top-ranking member of theBilderberg council made a claim also confirmed by Coleman: “The subsequentoverthrow of the Argentine government, followed by economic chaos and politicalupheavals, were planned by Kissinger Associates acting in concert with LordCarrington, (former British Foreign Secretary and another top-ranking member ofthe Bilderberg council). We also learned that the Argentine operation wasplanned by the Rockefeller-controlled Aspen Institute of Colorado.The reason this action became so important is that the Bilderbergers saw theirpost-industrial zero-growth goal disintegrating, and acted accordingly by making“an example of Argentina as a warning to other Latin American nations to forgetany ideas they may have had to promote nationalism, independence and sovereignintegrity.”^'*The choice of Argentina was deliberate, because the richest nation in SouthAmerica was providing most of Mexico’s nuclear power technology, against thewishes of the Bilderbergers. The Falklands War ended that mutually beneficialcollabor ation in a hurry. |Without a doubt, the Group prefers to have Tv5exicoas an outlet of cheap, sweatshop slave labor, rather than to have it assertitself as a full-fledgedtr ading partnej; .Moreover, because of a constant barrage of negative in propaganda, few Americansrealize, even today, just how vital the Latin America market is to the interestsof the United States, ranging from technology to heavy industrial equipment.Healthy trade with Latinpicture24 [images/picture24.jpg]The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAmerica would “galvanize many faltering American companies and provide thousandsof new jobs.”^^The Bilderbergers sought to prevent this at all costs.Bilderberg Meddling in Foreign Affairs of Sovereign NationsT hese are just some of the ways the Bilderberg Group has sought to intervene incountries’ affairs:• The Bilderbergers took the decision for the U.S. to establish formal relationswith China before Nixon’s administration made it a public policy.• At a meeting in Saltsjdbaden, Sweden, in 1973, the Bilderbergers agreed toincrease the price of oil to $12 a barrel, a 350% jump meant to create economicchaos in the United States and Western Europe, in order to prop up the oilcorporations’ sagging fortunes. The perceived oil shortage formed part of thebackdrop of the staged Arab-Israeli war, and provided a cover for the formalendorsement of major price agreements negotiated prior to the outbreak of war.• In 1983, the Bilderbergers got a secret promise out of the then“ultraconservative” President Ronald Reagan to transfer 50 billion dollars ofAmerican taxpayers’ money to Third World and Communist countries through itsfavorite conduits, the IMF and the World Bank. That pledge was more than kept,and became known as the “Brady plan.”• The Bilderbergers orchestrated the decision to get rid of Margaret Thatcher asBritish Prime Minister, because she opposed the willing hand-over of Britishsovereignty to the European Super State designed by the Bilderbergers. And weall watched incredulously as her own party sold her out in favor of theBilderberg poodle, John Major.• In 1985, the Bilderbergers agreed to give full support to the StrategicDefence Initiative (Star Wars), long before it became the official policy of theU.S. government.Bilderberg Objectives• At their 1990 meeting at Glen Cove, Long Island, New York, they decided thattaxes had to be raised to pay more towards the debt owed to the internationalbankers. Bilderberg luminary. President George H.W. Bush, signed off on thetax-hiking “budget agreement” in 1990, and it lost him the election.• At the 1992 meeting, the group debated the possibility of conditioning thepublic into accepting the idea of a UN Army that could, through the use offorce, interfere in the internal policy and conflict resolution of sovereignnations. This Bilderberger proposal was given front-page coverage by two ofCanada’s leading periodicals, the Toronto Star and the National Post, during the2006 meeting in Ottawa.• The multimillion-dollar sale of Ontario Hydro, owned at the time by theCanadian government, was discussed for the first time at the Bilderberg meetingin King City in 1996. Shortly after, Ontario Hydro was broken up into fiveindependent companies and privatized.•Starting at the 1996 meeting and continuing through 1998, Kosovo fell under themicroscope of the Bilderbergers when they discussed the formation of a greaterAlbanian state following “trusteeship” of an “independent” Kosovo, thedismemberment of Yugoslavia (by the return of its northern province, which has350,000 ethnic Hungarians, to Hungary) as part of a general re-drawing ofborders in the region (calculated to continue regional instability andconflict), and the reconstruction of billions of dollars of destroyed regionalinfrastructure at western taxpayers’ expense.• Leaked reports from the 2002 meeting stated that the war in Iraq had beendelayed until March 2003, at a time when every newspaper in the world wasexpecting the attack to be launched in the summer/fall of 2002.• In 1999, Kenneth Clarke MP, Martin S. Feldstein, president of the NationalBureau of Economic Research, Stanley Fisher, deputy managing director of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), Ottmar Issing,board member of the European Central Bank and Jean-Claude Trichet, governor ofthe Bank of France, discussed “Dollarization” as the next step after the singleEuropean currency.• The Bilderbergers have discussed the formation of an Asian bloc under theleadership of Japan, with free trade, a single currency and a political unionsimilar to the European Union.• The splintering of Canada as a step toward an American Union was originallyscheduled for 1997, but unexpected media coverage in the Toronto Star, Canada’smost popular daily newspaper, during the 1996 meeting in King City, at leastforced the group to postpone their plan. The proposed breakup of Canada wasdescribed in several books on the subject, including New World Order Corruptionin Canada, a collection of essays edited by Robert O’Driscoll and ElizabethElliott (Saigon Press, 1994).Chapter SixBILDERBERG PUPPETSF rom the start of his political career as governor of California, Ronald Reagandistanced himself from tough, old-time traditionalists and put Rockefeller menin as his key advisors. By his 1980 presidential election, those who thought“conservative, traditional America” had won could not have imagined how wrongthey were. Though Reagan promised, if elected, to dismiss the Chairman of theFederal Reserve, Paul A. Volcker, because of his anti-inflation policy, Reaganbroke his word, to the disbelief of the conservative wing of the RepublicanParty, once he took office.By coincidence or not, Anthony Wedgewood Benn, a member of the BritishParliament told members of the Socialist International meeting in Washington onDecember 8, 1980, “You can thrive under Volcker’s credit collapse if you profile[translation: brainwash] Reagan to intensify the credit collapse.”These comments bring several questions immediately to mind: What did Benn mean?Was he implying someone had influence over Ronald Reagan? Why would Reagan breakhis word to his own party? Why did he favor Rockefeller advisors to theexclusion of others on his personal team?One of Reagan’s “insiders” was Peter Vickers Hall, a man known to be a topFabianist in the U.S., and a member of the Tavistock Institute for HumanRelations, a Bilderberg-affiliated organization. In 1981, Hall made this speech:“There are two Americas. One is the nineteenth century, heavy, industry-basedsociety. The other is the growing post-industrialThk True Story of the Bilderberg Groupsociety, in some cases built on the shards of: the old America. It is the crisisbetween these two worlds which will produce the economic and social catastropheof the next decade. The two worlds are in fundamental opposition; they cannotcoexist. In the end, the post industrial world must crush and obliterate theother one.”He was predicting the demise of the U.S economy and industry. How alarming isthat to hear from a man so closely connected to the President of the UnitedStates twenty-five years ago? Is it possible Reagan was a Bilderberg foil placedin the White House to fulfill a specific role for his sponsors?In his book. Conspirators' Hierarchy: The Story of the Committee of300y JohnColeman, makes this claim: “That the advice [Peter Vickers Hall’s] was taken andapplied to the Reagan administration can be seen in the collapse of the savingsand loan, and banking industries, which accelerated under Reagan economicpolicies.” Coleman also notes, in passing, that Milton Friedman presided overthe Bilderberg plans to de-industrialize America “using the Reagan presidency toaccelerate the collapse of first the steel industry, and then the auto andhousing industries.”It is upsetting to consider that the Bilderbergers often appear to be a nearlyomnipotent force with no counterweight capable of standing up to them. Afterlosing her prime ministership to John Major, Lady Thatcher told Jim Tucker atthe Spotlight newspaper that she considered being denounced by the Bilderbergersa “tribute,” because neither Britain nor any country should surrender itssovereignty. At least Lady Thatcher was only forced out of office and kept herlife. The same can’t be said for Aldo Moro, Italian Prime Minister.Bii.derberg Connection to the Aldo Moro AssassinationI n 1982, John Coleman, a former intelligence operative with access to topechelons of power and secrets, revealed that Italy’s former Prime Minister, AldoMoro, “a loyal member of the Christian Democrat Party, who opposed ‘zero growth’and population reductions planned for his country was murdered by assassinscontrolled by P2 Masonry with the object of bringing Italy into line with Clubof Rome and Bilderberg orders to de-industrialize the country and considerablyreduce its population.”Bilderberg PuppetsColeman claims in Conspirators' Hierarchy that the globalists wanted to useItaly to destabilize the Middle East, their main objective. “Moro’s plans tostabilize Italy, through full employment and industrial and political peace,would have strengthened Catholic opposition to Communism and made thedestabilization of the Middle East — a prime goal — that much harder.”Coleman described with meticulous detail the sequence of events that paralyzedthe Italian nation: how Moro was kidnapped by the Red Brigades in the spring of1978 in broad daylight and subsequently brutally shot to death, with all of hisbodyguards murdered in cold blood. On November 10th, 1982, in a Rome courtroom,Gorrado Guerzoni, a close friend of the deceased, testified that Aldo Moro, whohad been a leading politician for decades, was “threatened by an agent of theRoyal Institute for International Affairs (RIIA) while he was still the U.S.Secretary of State.”Coleman recounts how, at the trial of members of the Red Brigades, “several ofthem testified that they knew of high-level U.S. involvement in the plot to killMoro.” In June and July of 1982, “Aldo Moro’s widow testified that her husband’smurder came about as a result of serious threats against his life, made by whatshe called a high ranking United States political figuredAsked by the judge if she could tell the court what was said by this person,Eleanora Moro repeated the exact phrase given by Guerzoni in his priortestimony: “Either you stop your political line or you will pay dearly for it.”In one of the more chilling pages of his book, Coleman writes the following:“Recalled by the judge, Guerzoni was asked if he could identify the person Mrs.Moro was talking about. Guerzoni replied that it was Henry Kissinger, as he hadpreviously intimated.”Why would a high-ranking U.S. diplomat threaten a leading politician of anindependent European nation? Guerzoni’s sensational and potentially damagingtestimony to U.S.-Italian relations was instantly broadcast all across WesternEurope on November 10th, 1982. Yet, apparently, not one television station inAmerica thought the news worthy of anyone’s attention, and this despite the factthat Kissinger had been condemned as an accomplice to these murders.That blackout wasn’t really surprising, as we shall see in Part Two concerningthe Council on Foreign Relations.The True Story of the Bii derberg GroupBilderberg Baptism of Bill ClintonA s a final illustration of Bilderberg influence, President Bill Clinton was“anointed” for the presidency at the 1991 Bilderberg Conference in Baden-Baden,which he attended. What was completely unknown to most of the U.S. and worldmedia was that Clinton then took an unexpected, unannounced trip to Moscow,directly from this Bilderberg meeting.On Tuesday, June 9'*^, he met for ninety minutes with Soviet Interior MinisterVadim Bakatin. Mr. Bakatin, a minister in the doomed cabinet of PresidentMikhail Gorbachev, was in the middle of campaigning in the fiercely-contestedPresidential election, the vote for which was a mere six days away. Yet, he tooktime out of his crowded schedule to meet unexpectedly with theinternationally-unknown Governor of Arkansas. Wliy?Mr. Bakatin’s subsequent career might provide a clue. Although Gorbachev lostthe Presidential election, Bakatin, a “reformer,” was rewarded by PresidentYeltsin with the top spot at the KGB. It appears that President Clinton was sentby the Bilderbergers directly to Moscow to get his KGB student-era, anti-VietNam War files “buried” before he announced his candidacy for the U.S.Presidency, which occurred some two-and-a-half months later.One of the few U.S. papers to run this story was the Arkansas Democrat, whichdid so under the headline: “Clinton Has Powerful Buddy in U.S.S.R. - New Head ofKGB.”It may come as no surprise, therefore, that, according to sources,Bilderberger-backed candidate Clinton promised President Yeltsin that, if he wonthe election, Russian warships would be given full refuelling and other portprivileges at all U.S. Navy bases. This promise was more than kept once Clintonwas sworn in as the U.S. President.According to Samuel “Sandy” Berger, formerly Bill Clinton’s national securityadvisor, speaking at the Brookings Institution, “Globalization — economic,technological, cultural and political integration — is not a choice. It’s agrowing fact. It’s a fact that will proceed inexorably, with or without ourapproval. It’s a fact we ignore to our peril.”He is right. As Jim Tucker once told me, “God may have created the universe, butas far as planet earth is concerned, the message toBilderberg PuppetsGod from the Bilderberg Group is simply this: Thanks, but well take it fromherefpicture25 [images/picture25.jpg]picture26 [images/picture26.jpg]Chapter SevenWATERGATE CON GAMET he Watergate crisis is a case of mistaken identity and a travesty of justice.The truth behind Watergate has never been revealed, but those who orchestratedthe overthrow of the Shah, the war in the Falklands, the death of Aldo Moro andthe downfall of Margaret Thatcher are again implicated. Do we know for sure thatRichard Nixon abused his presidential powers? What if the “smoking gun” and the“damning” evidence of “abuse” were manufactured? Pat Nixon always claimed herhusband was framed, and believed history will eventually vindicate him.According to my sources, who attended Bilderberg conferences in the early 1970s,the role of the Washington Post newspaper was to keep the heat on Nixon byreleasing one “revelation” after another, thereby engendering a climate ofpublic distrust of President Nixon.Top level British Secret Intelligence Service intelligence analyst, JohnColeman, in his book. Conspirators' Hierarchy, directly pointed his finger atKatherine Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post from 1963 to 1993, andaccused her of murdering her husband, Philip L. Graham, a case the FBI hasofficially classed as “suicide.” He alleges that she killed her husband just soshe could take control of the newspaper. What’s more interesting is that such agrave accusation never garnered a civil suit for libeling the now deadmultimillionairess (and confirmed Bilderberg member). Those who have studied theBilderbergers and their system of protections believe that to address thecharges would give Coleman more credence, and Katherine Graham’s family, friendsand associates have no Intention of doing that. They have chosen theThe True Story of the Bilderberg Grouppath of “discretion is the better part of truth,” to adapt a familiar cliche.Yet, the Washington Post's part in the Watergate crisis demonstrates the immensepower of the press, as was quite properly anticipated by the controllers of theU.S. media, better known as Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) — a group weshall examine in Part Two. The scandal involving Nixon and his administrationmortally wounded the Office of the Presidency and assaulted the institutionsupon which the republic of the United States stands. How did this benefit theBilderberg Group? Certainly, an independent and strong America with anincorruptible head of state (I do not mean Richard Nixon) would have made itimpossible for the New World Order to realize their plans of global conquest.Wlio played a significant role in humiliating President Nixon?One of the most visible players was David Young, head of the “Plumbers,” aninteragency spy group with a Gestapo mentality working for the White HouseSpecial Investigations Unit, which Nixon created under John Ehrlichman. Young,who originally worked under one of the founding Bilderberg members, HenryKissinger, at the National Security Council, “bugged” the Wliite House. Histapes were the “smoking gun” that felled Nixon. In these incriminating tapes,Nixon is heard admitting he ordered the cover-up of the Watergate break-ins ashe discusses ways to frustrate the Watergate investigations. The recordingsfurther proved that the President had lied to the American public for ninemonths.Another key player was ex-CIA and FBI officer, James W. McCord, who was thesecurity director of the Committee for the Re-election of the President (Nixon).It seems he “accidentally” left the infamous piece of tape on a door in theWatergate building that alerted a security guard to the break-in. McCord wasarrested the night of the burglary along with four other men. He pleaded guiltyand was convicted on six counts. He later wrote a letter to Judge John J.Sirica, the judge of the Watergate case, in which he claimed perjury had beencommitted. McCord’s allegations — that the White House knew of the burglary andattempted to cover it up — drove the investigators to push harder to seize thesecret tape-recording system in the White House. After McCord confessed, heaccused CIA operatives of burning his personal papers in his home. McCordWatergate Con GameStill feared the CIA would kill him once he was locked up in the penitentiary toserve his sentence./ The pivotal player in the Watergate affair, however, was none other thanGeneral Alexander Haig. The general was a product of the Round Table, theBilderberg’s parallel group. In The Tavistock Institute: Sinister and Deadly,the ground-breaking book on the sinister plans of the world’s foremostbrainwashing institute, John Coleman untangled the secret arrangements betweenthe shadow government, U.S. politicians in the service of the New World Orderand the obliging press. He notes how Haig came to the attention of JosephCalifano, an American member of the Queen of England’s Round Table. Califano,legal council of the Democratic National Convention, actually interviewed AlfredBaldwin, one of the “plumbers” in the Watergate break-in, and made notes onMcCord’s background and why McCord selected Baldwin to be on his “team.”“Even more damaging,” writes Coleman, “Califano’s memorandum contained alldetails of transcripts of wiretaps of conversations between Nixon and there-election committee, all this before the break-in occurred.”Why wasn’t Califano arraigned for withholding evidence?Coleman got his hands on priceless Tavistock secret manuals that spelled out themethodology used to destroy President Richard Nixon: “The way President Nixonwas first isolated, surrounded by traitors and then confused, followed to theletter the Tavistock-method of gaining full control of a person according to themethodology laid down by Tavistock’s chief theoretician. Dr. Kurt Lewin.”That methodology included the following: “One of the main techniques forbreaking morale through a strategy of terror consists in exactly this tactic —keep the person hazy as to where he stands and just what he may expect. Inaddition, if frequent vacillations between severe disciplinary measures andpromises of good treatment together with the spreading of contradictory news,make the cognitive structure of this situation utterly unclear, then theindividual may cease even to know a particular plan would lead toward or awayfrom his goal. Under these conditions, even those individuals who have definitegoals and are ready to take risks are paralyzed by severe inner conflict inregard to what to do.”So successfully were Tavistock terror tactics and brainwashing used to removethe President of the United States that Americans beganThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupto believe the plethora of lies, distortions and Orwellian double-talk mountedby the conspirators as truth, when in fact, “Watergate” was an outright lie frombeginning to end.Nixon and his two closest aides, Haldeman and Ehrlichman, had no clue as to whatwas going on. They were no match for the combined forces of theBilderberg/RIIA/Tavistock Institute under the direction of the British MI6, witha secret annual budget, unknown to the public, of around $350-500 million. (As aside note, the British Parliament has no effective jurisdiction over MI6.) Theywere completely overwhelmed and never knew that “David Young, a graduate ofOxford and a longtime Kissinger associate through Round Table assets such as thelaw firm of Milbank Tweed, was working in the basement of the White House,supervising leaks.”James McCord’s confession of perjury to Judge John Sirica should have warnedNixon that he was being set up for a downfall. But, the confused and emotionallyparalysed Nixon followed, to the letter, the Tavistock profiling of how aperson’s morale can be broken through a strategy of terror.Kissinger was responsible for brainwashing and confusing President Nixon, while,in effect, it was Haig who ran the U.S. government during this “orientationperiod” of the President.Coleman writes that “on the insistence of the RIIA, Haig virtually took over themanagement of the Government of the United States after the April 1973 coupd’etat.”Haig filled the top one hundred posts in Washington with mei from the BrookingsInstitution, Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) and the Council on ForeignRelations, men who were loyal to the superimposed interests of the Bilderberg’sWorld Order above those of the United States of America.According to Coleman’s intelligence sources, in the spring of 1970, WilliamMcDermott of the FBI went to see the top security officer atthe RAND Corporati on in San ta Monica, California, to warn him that DanielEllsberg was suspected of stealing, for the U.S. military, RAND study papers onViet Nam and copying them before returning them to the RAND office. RAND is anon-profit organization created to connect military planning with research anddevelopment decisions. RAND is also referred to ;r s the U.S. BrainwashingInstitutjo ri, for its experiments in methodology for social planning andpsychologicalWatergate Con Gameresponse to stress. In the subsequent meeting with RAND’s director, Dr. HenryRowan, McDermott was told by Rowan that a Department of Defense (DOD) inquirywas already in progress. Because of Rowan’s assurance, the FBI dropped itsinvestigation of Ellsberg. What the FBI didn’t know was that Rowan wasEllsberg’s best friend, and Coleman discovered that “no inquiry was in progress,nor did the DOD ever conduct one. Ellsberg retained his security clearance atRAND and blatantly went on removing and copying Viet Nam War documents right upto the time of his exposure during the Pentagon Papers affair, which rocked theNixon Administration to its foundations.”At that stage, Nixon’s Atomic Energy Commission was dismantled, so ChairmanJames Schlesinger could then be drafted to serve as the government’s Secretaryof Defense. It would be Schlesinger’s task to require all military commanders torefuse orders from the White House prior to top Republicans’ threatening toimpeach the President. Instead, Nixon voluntarily resigned August 8, 1974.Was the humiliation of Nixon a lesson and a warning to future Presidents of theUnited States not to imagine they could defy the direction or manipulation ofthe Shadow World Government and win?More specifically, the collapse of Nixon’s presidency led to the reduction ofthe armed services after U.S. withdrawal from Viet Nam and thede-industrializing of the United States with the signing of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which Nixon vehemently opposed — tworesults that directly fulfilled the Post-Industrial-Zero-Growth Strategies ofthe Bilderberg Group.John Coleman added in Conspirators’ Hierarchy, “From this beginning, we cantrace the roots of the 1991 recession/depression which... cost the jobs of 30million Americans.”By far the most influential player in the Watergate Crisis was Nixon’s NationalSecurity Adviser — Henry Kissinger. As far back as the mid-1960s, theBilderbergers placed Kissinger in charge of a small group consisting of JamesSchlesinger, Alexander Haig and Daniel Ellsberg. Working with them was theInstitute of Policy Studies chief theoretician, Noam Chomsky. While the IPS wasthe brainchild of the British Round Table, the Tavistock Institute determinedits agenda, and together they developed programmed-learning techniques. In the’60s, Kissinger’s team and Chomsky were creating the “New Left” as a grassrootsmovement In the U.S. to engender strife and unrest. TheirThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupgoal was to spread chaos and to proliferate the “ideals” of left-wing nihilisticsocialism. From this position, they could engineer the “big stick” with which tobeat the United States’ political establishment.Once Kissinger was installed as National Security Advisor, he, Ellsberg and Haigwere then able to set in motion the RIIA’s Watergate plan to oust PresidentNixon after he publicly declared he did not approve of the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade (GATT), a statement that infuriated David Rockefeller. Infact, Nixon was right. The GATT has since proved to be a further erosion ofAmerica’s national sovereignty, as Sir James Goldsmith, a billionaire member ofthe European Parliament, testified it would to the U.S. Senate in 1994, justbefore he died.As Nixon’s National Security Advisor, Kissinger and his staff received allintelligence, foreign and domestic, law enforcement information, including FBItop-clearance and most-secret information before any of it was released toNixon. No wonder that Haldeman and Ehrlichman, the two men that Nixon trustedwith his life, could not understand what was going on around them.For Kissinger, it was the zenith of his career. Disgracing Nixon and drumminghim out of office handed Kissinger unprecedented powers, the likes of which havenever been seen since. With Nixon’s resignation, the Bilderbergers finally saw“their” president, Gerald Ford, move into the White House. The New World Order’syes man took direct orders from Henry Kissinger, an agent of David Rockefeller,a servant to the Bilderbergers.Chapter EightBILDERBERG UNMASKEDT homas Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of American democracy explainedit this way: “Single acts of tyranny may be ascribed to the accidental opinionof a day; but a series of oppressions, begun at a distinguished period, andpursued unalterably through every change of ministers [Presidents], too plainlyprove a deliberate systematical plan of reducing us to slavery.”The deep attitude of the global, mostly male, corporate gang was expressed byDavid Rockefeller at the June 1991 Bilderberg meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany,where he argued for “supranational sovereignty of an intellectual elite andworld bankers, which is surely preferable to the national auto determinationpracticed in past centuries.On December 9, 2001, Professor John McMurtry of the University of Guelph inCanada said this in his opening address at a Forum entitled “How Should CanadaRespond To Terrorism and War?”: “As such a structure of world rule, it isaccomplished by the same financial and media system deciders as put Tony Blairinto office in Britain and George W. Bush into the White House against amajority vote. Trans-national corporations have marketed and financed thesepolitical leaders to ensure that captive states serve them rather than thepeoples governments are elected by, guaranteeing through state plenipotentiariesand trans-national trade edicts that governments can no longer govern them incommon interest without infringing the new trade and investment laws in whichtrans-national corporations alone are granted rights.”The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupWliat perplexes me most is that other people don’t see the dangers. Is itbecause knowledge brings responsibility and clamors for a decisive response? Ifwe acknowledge that, in fact, there does exist a power far greater than theelected office of the President, a “moral” authority far more powerful than theChristian Pope, an invisible power that controls the world’s military apparatusand intelligence systems, controls the international banking system, controlsthe most effective propaganda system in history, we might be then forced toconclude that democracy is, at best, an illusion, and at worst, a prelude to adictatorship that will become known as the New World Order.Michael Thomas, a Wall Street investment banker who has won wide acclaim as anauthor, and is regarded by many as the Reagan-Bush era’s most incisivecommentator, said in SCH News, May 28, 1999, “If the Bilderbergers seem morepublicity-shy than ever, that is, among other reasons, because their proposals,implemented by subservient agencies such as the IMF and the World Bank havecaused more mass devastation in recent years than World War II ever did.”“The unhappy result,” as ex-BBC journalist Tony Gosling reports at his Web site,www.bilderberg.org, “is a picture of Western democracy subverted, with decisionmakers getting together not for reasons important to ordinary people — socialjustice, common interest, and quality of life — but to strengthen economicausterity and bring even more private gain for the world’s political andcorporate elite.”Despite the evidence at hand, the majority still believe that with all theday-to-day problems they have to face, they can’t be bothered to take the“conspiracy theories” seriously. That is exactly what the Tavistock profilinghas done to us. Faced with chaos, we are reacting as Nixon did when he was Hrstisolated, confused and later destroyed by the global planners. Demoralized andconfused, lacking self-esteem, unsure of the future, people are far more readyto welcome the sudden appearance of a “Messiah,” a New Order that promises toeliminate drugs, pornography, child prostitution, rampant crime, wars, famineand suffering, and guarantee a well-ordered society in which people live inharmony.But this newly hatched “harmony” will encroach on our freedoms, human rights,thoughts and our very existence. “Harmony” will mean a welfare society; we willbecome just a number in the vast bureaucratic system of the New World Order.Non-conformists, such as myself.Bilderberg Unmaskedwill be interned in Guantanamo-like concentration camps. All this will happenunless we, the people of (what is left of) the free world, stand up to defendour national ideals, rather than leave it in the hand of the governments, the EUcommissioners, the UN representatives and the royalty who have betrayed us.These nice, proper members of European royal families, the sweet-talking elderlyladies and the debonair gentlemen are, in reality, utterly ruthless. They willuse the suffering of every nation and exploit its wealth to protect theirprivileged way of life. The aristocracy’s fortunes are “inextricably woven andintertwined with the drug trade, the gold, diamond and arms trades, banking,commerce and industry, oil, the news media and entertainment industry.”^^How can these facts be verified, given that it is virtually impossible topenetrate the Bilderberg Group? Some of it cannot be checked, because theinformation comes straight out of intelligence files, with only a privilegedminority ever seeing it. Don’t expect the news media to ever mention theconspiracy on the nightly news bulletins. The press is under the total controlof the nice ladies and gentlemen who spend so much of their time inphilanthropic endeavors. Most people believe that, as they can’t see amotivation for the things I have described (and it doesn’t appear on the TV orradio news or in their newspapers) it must be a “conspiracy theory” — to beignored or mocked and, either way, rejected. Hard evidence is what they want,and hard evidence is difficult to come by. This is what Tavistock-typepsychological profiling has done to the human race. The New World Order hasstriven to neutralize the only real threat that we, the people, can pose totheir plans.I am attempting to rip the mask off the New World Order and show it for what itis. There are many sources and documents in this book which can corroborate, atleast, a good number of the facts, and which will leave, 1 hope, an intelligentreader wondering if there is more to all of this than might seem plausible.picture27 [images/picture27.jpg]All except the secretary have been President or Chairman ofCFR.Richard H^ass, Current President CFRDennis Ross, Counselor, the Washington, Institute for Near East Policy withRichard Haass, Bilderberg 2005 . m,picture28 [images/picture28.jpg]PART TWOThe Council on Foreign Relations(CFR)picture29 [images/picture29.jpg]The Trilateral Commission doesn’t secretly run the world.

About twenty-fivehundred years ago, one such upstart venture we call “Roman” began as a swindleof its sister states, known to history as the “Latin League.” Eventually, mostof the Latins received a second-class form of citizenship: the so-called “Latinrights.” The original region of Latiuni is now known as Lazio, where my familyand I had lived, in Ladispoli.In the first week of November 1999 I received what looked to be a postcard froman acquaintance from that small town on the Mediterranean coast in the provinceof Rome. The card simply said, “Having a good time. Wish you were here.”It was dated November 29, 1999, and signed, “Fashoda.”Obviously there was something terribly wrong with this apparently innocentholiday memento. In addition, the Italian postcard was posted with a Frenchstamp... and sealed with a March 30, 1980 seal!Anyone in the intelligence business will tell you immediately that dates andplaces hold a tremendous significance to spooks and their couriers. March 30,1980 was the date my family officially left the Soviet Union. While in Italy, wehad settled in Ladispoli, which would serv^e as our home for the next year.“This was hand-delivered and left In my mailbox by someone who had somethingimportant to tell me.” I thought. “Italian postcard with a French stamp.Interesting....“November 29, 1999. That’s three-and-a-half weeks from now,” I said out loud. Iturned the postcard over and examined the non-The True Story oe the Bii.derberg Groupdescript photograph. It was a typical summer holiday scene: an endless sea ofbathers and a barely distinct line of blue water on the horizon.I was able to make out two people, a mother, most likely, and her son all inwhite, staring straight ahead while a toddler innocently hugged his knee.I walked out into the street. Rain fell lightly. Two small children jumped andsquealed delightfully from puddle to puddle, leaving a print of their soles onthe edge of the road. I crossed the slick street beneath the dark rushing cloudsand pushed open the door of a corner pub.November 29, 1999. What the hell did it all mean?I re-read the text.“Having a good time. Wish you were here. Fashoda.”“Who the hell is this guy?” I racked my brain for any intelligence contact I hadnurtured over the past decade. I must admit there were some strange names andnicknames in that long list, but no Fashoda.I ordered a coffee while mechanically twirling the postcard in my hand.“Sounds African,” I thought to myself But with the exception of half a dozen keySASS operatives, members of the South African Secret Service, I had not beenable to establish a stable relationship with a single member of the securityapparatus of any African nation.“Could this be a code?” I mumbled to myself“Fashoda, Fashoda, Fashoda.” I turned the postcard over again and staredaimlessly at the mother and her children.Then, suddenly, in a flash, it came. “Fashoda!!!”Once an obscure dot on the map of Sudanese Egypt, the fort at Fashoda was builton a dusty peninsula connected by a narrow strip of land to a ridge which runsparallel to the water. The surrounding country is mostly deep swamp; mosquitoesare present in the millions. The climate is always humid and the temperaturerarely below ninety-five in the shade.The name and the place have since disappeared into the mists of history, but inSeptember 1898, Britain and France seemed on the verge of war, the closest thetwo countries have been to armed confrontation since the battle of Waterloo in1815, because at Fashoda, half a world away, French officers leading Africantroops confronted British officers leading African troops, each commanderclaiming sovereignty and demanding the withdrawal of the other.At the end of the century both the British and the French believed that if aFrench scouting party could claim a tributary on the Upper Nile at Fashoda,France could build a dam there, block the flow of the Nile, trigger chaos inEgypt that would force Britain out of the Suez Canal, cut Britain’s strategiclifeline to India, and thus topple the Empire that depended on India’s wealthand manpower.After a tense confrontation, face was saved for all parties by an agreement thatthree flags — Egyptian, British and French — would fly over the fort. Thefollowing year, the French and British governments agreed that the watersheds ofthe Nile and the Congo should mark the boundaries between their spheres ofinfluence. Much of the map of modern Africa derives from this agreement. It alsobegan a warming of relations that led to the Anglo-French Entente of 1904, amajor step on the road to World War I.“Fashoda is not a person but a place!” I could feel my heart pumping.November 29, 1999. Ladispoli. Lazio, Rome, Italy, Fashoda, March 30, 1980,France... March 30, November 29, 1980, 1999, France, Italy, Rome, Lazio,Ladispoli, Fashoda... FIFRLL...FRILLF...FFR1LLAgain and again, I kept looking for a pattern, but I just couldn’t nail it down.The rain had stopped and a purplish-green rainbow had extricated itself frombehind a three-story building. A glum waitress finally appeared and clumsily setmy full-to-the-brim cafe creme on the table. An elderly gentleman settled at anadjacent table, bumping his knee. Several vociferous men at the bar werediscussing money, interrupting each other with a heavy thump on a victim’sshoulder or forearm.I suddenly sat up. “Fashoda. Travis Read!!!”Travis Read was a hoodlum I had met during King City’s 1996 Bilderbergconference. He appeared to be an undisciplined and obnoxious small-time thiefwho hung around with Garik S., an Israeli high school dropout. Garik laterturned out to be a highly-trained Mossad operative working out of a basementapartment in Etobicoke, a non-descript suburb of Toronto.Travis had a penchant for getting arrested and almost as quickly of getting letgo. He also had a penchant of somehow always “sharing” a prison cell with amajor criminal or a valued government informant, an extremely unusualcoincidence, keeping in mind that government69The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupinformants are high-value targets whose lives are jealously protected by thecops. As I later found out, Travis Read had become a criminal in order to workwith the criminals. That was his cover. That was his rain dance.He was sent to Sudan by liaisons working for both the CIA and Canada’s nationalpolice force, the RCMP, an outfit involved with criminal intelligence. Traviswas your typical shit disturber — cocky, a congenital liar, almost alwaysintoxicated, rude... and almost always hard up for cash. The details of hisSudan trip were never revealed, but just as in 1898, this God-forsaken place wasattracting all the wrong characters for all the right reasons. It was a hotbedof drugs and guns and oil, and a staging grounds for destabilizing effortsagainst a number of African nations too tired to fight protracted wars and tooweak to resist U.S. and French and British and Russian and Chinese “friendly”political overtures. All of these African nations shared one common denominator— oil.Travis hated the hypocrisy of the system that had created and used him. Yetparadoxically, because he possessed so many secrets which he took great care tohide from prying eyes, he was still alive.“If Travis wants to see me,” I thought to myself, “this is going to getextremely messy.”Travis was an intelligence junkyard dog. He knew too much, had pissed off toomany people over the years, and had unnecessarily threatened some heavy highrollers. This man was bad news. And yet, I was at once both fearful andfascinated.“What does he have that could possibly interest me?” I muttered to myselfI caught the silhouette of a stunning woman against the windowpane. Her gracefulthin, long neck seemed to extend into infinity. An expression of mild melancholylent a mysterious beauty to her Botticellian face, while a wiggly-bottomedteenager clad in her school uniform noisily sucked back her milkshake at acorner table facing the street.In order to get to the bottom of what was up, it was clear that I had to go toRome. As I pushed open the pub door and walked out onto a noisy street, the ideadid not appeal to me. Travis Read was trouble, and even if he had genuineinformation to pass along, he could easily have been set up by his controllers,who always kept him on a long enough leash that allowed him to do things mostcivilians could neverHit or Miss, 1999do. After Canada and Bilderberg 1996, I could think of enough people who wouldhave been happy to see me out of the picture.The more I thought of it, the more I expected that a trap was being set up forme. I just didn’t know who was behind the setup. To pull this off, I neededhelp.On November 7, 1999, I participated in a four-way satellite, secure networkphone conversation with several former members of the Soviet Union’s securityapparatus. I must admit that when the chips are down, I have always been able torely on former Soviet officers. They inherently do not trust the West and arenot easily bought, contrary to what mainstream newspapers and press reports wantyou to believe. This makes them trustworthy in my eyes.These were no ordinary men. One of them was an expert on short- and medium-rangenuclear and bacteriological weapons and their delivery systems. Another was akey staff officer under General Valery Manilov, Deputy Chief of Staff of theRussian Armed Forces. One year later, Manilov would become the most outspokenRussian military figure to denounce the Kursk “accident” as a deliberate U.S.provocation.We quickly agreed that 1 could not walk into this alone, and one of the menvolunteered names of former KGB contacts and security people stationed in Romeas my back-ups. To my surprise, one of the names was a well-known Vaticanclergyman, whose apparent anti-Communist posture was a well-concealed mirage.Out of the list of some dozen names, I quickly settled on three, two of whom Ipersonally knew, with the third a unanimous choice amongst the rest of thegroup.Travis was going to meet me on November 29. That, at least, was obvious. If heknew where to find me, he obviously knew my telephone number and many anotherpertinent piece of information.“He is either setting me up or he is in trouble,” I thought. “If Travis is beingset up with his full knowledge by his controllers, he must have pushed the wrongpeople too far.” To survive himself, he was most likely told to deliver me tothe other side. Loyalty was definitely not Travis Read’s strong suit.“But then again,” I thought, “it is his life that is on the line, most likely...” And when one lacks friends, as he did, all one can hope for are temporarybusiness associates. They just may be your ticket to another round. I understoodhis predicament.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAfter several more short telephone conversations via a secure line,I agreed to meet my contacts in Rome, at Hotel Tefi.Hotel Teh, owned by an old acquaintance of my grandfather, for years served as ahideout for secret service operatives from the former Soviet Union who used Romeas a home base for counter-intelligence activities. It is strategically locatedjust off the Piazza della Repubblica, some three hundred meters from whereGogol, one of Russia’s giants of literature, in 1842 wrote his immortal workDead Souls. Among Teh’s original owners was my grandfather’s childhood friend,both having been born in Karasubazar, Belogorsk in the Crimea.The men who appeared on November 26 at Hotel Teh were seasoned veterans with anumber of top-secret assignments in their resumes. These were veterans of“irregular warfare” — surveillance, psychological intimidation, blackmail.Watching them handle their weapons, I concluded that among their numerous“skills” they were also likely contract killers. These were not the type ofpeople you would ever wish to double-cross.Yet I knew that I was safe in their company. My grandfather had put his own lifeon the line in the early 1950s to save the lives of these men’s fathers, all KGBofficers, just as Stalin, months from death, launched his hnal purge of the topRed Army officer corps and secret service high command. They were my invisiblearmy with a web of contacts that extended to every secret service agency on theplanet. The NSA, CIA and FBI were no exceptions. Russian intelligence has alwaysbeen surprisingly effective in penetrating U.S. agencies.Alexander Ivanovitch was born in the small town of Chesis, near Riga. DuringWWIl, it had been completely wiped out by German artillery. Konstantin was fromthe town of Borisov in Belorussia. Anatolii from Moscow. All were highlydecorated former intelligence officers who had a heavy axe to grind with theWest.After a brief and heart warming Kak dela dorogoy? (How are you my dear?) andPrivet clielovek! (Hi guy!), we got down to business.Konstantin pulled out a pistol and laid it gently on the table.Znaesli Shto Eto? (You know what this is?), he asked me looking over to hisright as he placed special emphasis on the know. I looked down at a dark objectin front of me."},{"pageContent":"I know my guns, and it wasn’t difficult to see by the non-metallic polymer framethat I was staring at a Clock semiautomatic pistol.“G36,” said Anatolii, “still a full year away from public consumption.” He wasobviously enjoying himself. It was the first time I had seen the new Clock —compact .45 ACP with a 3.78-inch barrel and six-round single-stack magazine thatwas 0.36 centimetres narrower, and a full four ounces lighter to carry, than theantecedent double-stack 10-round Clock C30. Those who used it called it “poetryin motion.”“You may need to use it,” barked Anatolii in a staccato-like rhythm.“Piazza della Repubblica, at dusk,” said Konstantin.“Whatever you do, don’t let him dictate the place and time of meeting,” saidAnatolii insistently, holding my forearm in his enormous hand. “Otherwise, wecan’t protect you.”On November 27, late in the afternoon, my cell phone rang. It was Travis. He wasstaying at some dive on the outskirts of Rome. He asked me to meet him near theColiseum at 10 a.m. on November 29.“Piazza della Repubblica at 5:30 p.m.,” I interrupted him.“I make the rules,” barked Travis.“Piazza della Repubblica at 5:30 p.m.,” I repeated, raising my voice.“Do you want the info or don’t you?” said Travis.“Not enough to get killed,” I said coldly.He hung up the telephone. Some twenty minutes later Travis rang back. He swore,he threatened, he pleaded, swore some more. Then, he agreed.“All right. Piazza della Repubblica at 5:30 p.m.”“Travis,” I said. “I know you are in trouble. I just hope you are not using meas a honey pot. That would be quite unfortunate.” He hung up.Piazza della Repubblica is strategically situated some 50 meters from Hotel Teh.In the middle of the Piazza is Cian Lorenzo Bernini’s masterpiece fountain inhonor of his great protector Urbanus VIII. Four dolphins support two valveswhich in turn support a triton blowing water through a shell held up in hishands.I phoned Konstantin from a public phone booth.“Cood,” was all he said before hanging up.Back at the hotel the plan was quickly put together.“That Volvo is your getaway car,” said Anatolii, pointing at a black car parkedin the shade next to an ice-cream parlor.“Ifthere is trouble,” said Konstantin, “it would take Sasha [Alexander] lessthan Hve seconds to get to you.”73The True Story of the Bii.derberg Group“If they ever got near you,” noted Anatolii pensively.I sincerely doubted that my adversaries — should there be any — would have anyinkling ol what they were in lor.On the morning of November 29, Anatolii and Konstantin, expert marksmen andformer members of the Russian Special Forces, took up their positions on therools ol adjacent buildings. Around lour in the afternoon I ordered a drink atone of the outdoor terraces around the piazza. Anatolii and Konstantin had aclear shot at anyone approaching me from any direction. Both held custom madenecked-down rilles. These were no ofl-the-shelf things. The rilles werespecially manulactured to shoot a small caliber bullet at the extremely highspeed ol over 1,500 meters per second. The trajectory of the bullet is thus veryHat, with little drop due to gravity over long ranges. Only those with very deeppockets could aflord such expensive toys.As I sat waiting lor my contact to appear, a large group ol French schoolchildren on a held trip walked by, blissfully and almost in unison licking theirgelatos. Alexander Ivanovitch sat waiting in the black Volvo across the piazza.Five-thirty came and went. There were no signs of Travis. Six p.M. Six-filteen.Nothing. He hnally called me around seven to tell me that he had decided to passon to me sealed diplomatic pouches with incriminating evidence detailing theU.S. government’s involvement in sectarian warfare in Sudan. This htted tightlywith the Bilderberger long-term objectives of prohts from never-ending war andoil scarcity.I told him that il this was his intention, and if he was talking to me over anopen cell phone, it was unlikely he would ever make it to the piazza alive. Itold him to stay put if he felt there was little chance of being found.Then, the phone went dead.You are probably not surprised to learn that Travis never showed up for ourmeeting. Around 8:30 p.m. we rushed into Travis’ residence, if you could call itthat, guns drawn. The one-bedroom dump had been completely ransacked. Yet, therewere no other signs of foul play, no bloodstains. And no Travis Read.To the best of my knowledge, he has never been heard from again. There were nodoubts in my mind that I had in fact spoken to Travis. I recognised hisunmistakable manner of speech, his particular way ofchewing his words and regurgitating them before spewing them out. He was theonly man I had ever met who spoke that way.Driving to the airport, I kept looking behind me, but there were no signs ofTravis. What I wouldn’t give to find out what happened to him.“Careful what you wish for,” my sixth sense warns me. “You might just get whatyou may have no stomach for.”In this line of work, you learn not to get too sentimental or too keen. Eitherone could be construed as a weakness; and either one could put you on the wrongend of a gun barrel.Once in a while, Travis’ ghost appears in the deepest recesses of my memory, amorbid reminder of the fragility and fallibility of the human spirit.75picture36 [images/picture36.jpg]Edward M. House and President Woodrow Wilson worked together P establish a worldgovernment through a League of Nations. House would go on to co-found theCouncil on Foreign Relations in 1921. House was the author of Philip Dm:Administrator, a book he wrote anonymously. In the novel Philip Dm, Americabecomes ruled by a dictator, who throws out the Constitution and introducesreform. Wilson oncef said, \"Mr. House is my second personality. He is my independent self. Histhoughts and mine are one. If I were in his place I would do just as hesuggested... If anyone thinks he is reflecting my opinion by whatever action hetakes, they are welcome to the conclusion.\"Chapter TenCROSSOVER PARTNERSA s in a conventional teleplay, there are actually secret spin-off organizationssimilar to the Bilderberg Group. The largest is the Round Table, whose branchesinclude Britain’s Royal Institute of International Affairs, Institutes ofInternational Affairs of Canada, Australia, South Africa, India and Holland, aswell as Institutes of Pacific Relations for China, Russia and Japan. One of theRound Table’s branches in the United States is called the Council on ForeignRelations, or CFRPart of the origins of the CFR go back to 1921 and one of its founders, EdwardMandell House, who was President Woodrow Wilson’s chief advisor and rumored tobe the power behind the Wilson administration from 1913 to 1921. Ironically,House was a known Marxist. He idealized socialism, and under his watch in theWhite House, he lobbied for a state-controlled central bank empowered to makeU.S. money. In 1913, the United States Congress still controlled the country’scurrency, but that year passage of the Federal Reserve Act transferred Congress’power to a private central bank. House also proposed the lb'*\" Amendment to theUnited States Constitution, which introduced the graduated income tax, anotheridea he borrowed from Karl Marx.^*^House also wrote the plan for the League of Nations, which was PresidentWilson’s prized proposal at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. Charles Seymour,House’s official biographer, said that Wilson “approved the House draft almostin its entirety, and his own rewriting of it was practically confined tophraseology.”The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAt the end of Wilson’s term in 1921, House and like-minded sympathizersestablished the Council on Foreign Relations. From the outset, their commitmentto form a one-world government based on a centralized global financing systemattracted the strangest mix of capitalist and socialist, opportunist andidealist. Among the potpourri of American elitists at that first meeting werethe rich and famous.Within a year, the Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations agreed to finance theCFR’s agenda and growth. President Franklin Roosevelt is responsible for fillingthe State Department with CFR members in 1940, and subsequent generations ofCFR-placed staff have run it ever since.The CFR is headquartered in New York in the Harold Pratt House, a four-storymansion on the corner of Park Avenue and 68th Street. The widow of an heir tothe Standard Oil Rockefeller fortune — Charles Pratt — donated the building totheir use in 1929. In 2006, over 4,000 of America’s leading Establishment aremembers (term or life) of the CFR Although the CFR is very influential ingovernment, it remains off the radar screen to most Americans. Only one personin five thousand knows about the organization, while even fewer are aware of itsreal purposes.During the first fifty years of its existence, the CFR received rare mediacoverage. Such anonymity might seem strange until you view a CFR membershiplist. It includes top executives from the New York Times, the Washington Post,the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, Time,Fortune, Business Week, U.S. News and World Report, along with many others.Since the media are part of the group’s think-tank sessions, we have to questiontheir “discretion.” If it is overdone, why? Why would they censor themselves?When asked this question at a CIA gathering nearly 25 years ago, CFR memberKatherine Graham, the legendary Washington Post publisher, told the audience,“There are some things the general public does not need to know about us andshouldn’t.”In fact, the CFR’s systemic conspiracy has been mentioned more than once in thepast by some of America’s leading individuals. As early as March 26, 1922, JohnF. Hylan, Mayor of New York, in a speech said, “The real menace of our republicis the invisible government, which, like a giant octopus, sprawls its slimylength over our city, state and nation. At the head is a small group of bankinghouses generally referred toCrossover Partnersas ‘international bankers.’ This little coterie of powerful internationalbankers virtually run our government for their own selfish ends.”On February 23, 1954, Senator William Jenner warned, in a speech, “Today thepath to total dictatorship in the United States can be laid by strictly legalmeans; unseen and unheard by the Congress, the President, or the people....Outwardly we have a Constitutional government. We have operating within ourgovernment and political system another body representing another form ofgovernment, a bureaucratic elite which believes our Constitution is outmoded andis sure that it is the winning side.... All the strange developments in foreignpolicy agreements may be traced to this group who are going to make us over tosuit their pleasure.”Historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. has called the CFR a “front organization” for“the heart of the American Establishment.” Newsweek has referred to the CFR’sleaders as “the foreign-policy establishment of the U.S.” Richard Rovere,writing in Esquire magazine, saw them as “a sort of Presidium for that part ofthe Establishment that guides our destu^y as a nation.”\\ /The 200-plus journalists, correspondents, and communications raecutives whobelong to the CFR defend the group’s right to private discussion on the basis ofa supposed need for a forum where concerned leaders can speak freely to analyzecritical events affecting U.S. political directions in a world economy, if theyare to have any hope of developing solutions and/or policies. Once thesesolutions and policies are announced, then the CFR welcomes press coverage andpublic debate. This implies that we should accept the 1987 CFR Report that isposted on the CFR’s Web site at face value. But, when any organization does nottolerate open publication of their discussions and activities, we have to wonderat the information we’re provided. Does such reporting represent the facts or isit what the Council wants us to see and believe?In Jim Marrs’ Rule by Secrecy, economist John Kenneth Galbraith, himself aformer member, called the CFR’s practices a scandal. “Why,” he asked, “shouldbusinessmen be briefed by Government officials on information not available tothe general public, especially since it can be financially advantageous?” To addfurther confusion, there is another coexisting organization with the sameone-world government objective, except its members represent global tradealliances: North America,The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupWestern Europe and Pacific Asia. It’s called the Trilateral Commission (TC) andwas founded, and financed, by David Rockefeller in 1973. Before establishingthis organization, he tested the idea for forming the commission at the 1972Bilderberg Group meeting in Knokke, Belgium.And guess what?Many of the same individuals who belonged to the CFR and the Bilderbergers alsojoined the Trilateral Commission. CFR members comprise Americans only. TheBilderberg Group is limited to members from the United States, Canada andWestern Europe. The Trilateral Commission brings together global power brokers,as I discuss in Part Three of this book. David Rockefeller, whose familyfinanced the CFR, is a common denominator among these parallel groups. Not onlyis he the CFR Chairman Emeritus, but he also continues to provide financial andpersonal support to the TC, CFR and Bilderberg Group.It’s no wonder, then, that critics see these three organizations as comprisingself-interested elitists protecting their wealth and the investments ofmultinational banks and corporations in the growing world economy at the expenseof developing nations and third-world countries. The policies they developbenefit them as well as move us towards a one-world government.To appreciate the extent of power the Bilderbergers, CFR and TC exercise, it isenough to recall that almost all of the presidential candidates for both partieshave belonged to at least one of these organizations, many of the U.S.congressmen and senators, most major policy-making positions, especially in thefield of foreign relations, much of the press, most of the leadership of theCIA, FBI, IRS (Internal Revenue Service), and many of the remaining governmentalorganizations in Washington. CFR members occupy nearly all White House cabinetpositions.Of CIA directors, only James R Schlesinger, who briefly headed It In 1973, wasnot a CFR member. He was, however, a protege of CFR member Daniel Ellsberg,famous for the release of the Viet Nam era “Pentagon Papers,” and hisappointment was approved by Henry Kissinger, a key Bilderberg, CFR and TCleader.Of U.S. presidents, we have seen a string of CFR members winning the electionsevery four years. In 1952 and 1956, CFR Adlai Stevenson challengedCFREisenhower. In 1960, it was CFRNixon vs. CFRKennedy. In 1964, theconservative wing of the Republican Party “stunned the Establishment” bynominating its candidate, Barry Goldwater, overCrossover PartnersNelson Rockefeller. Rockefeller and the CFR wing portrayed Barry Goldwater as “adangerous radical who would abolish Social Security, drop atom bombs on Hanoi,and in general be a reincarnation of the Fascist dictator Mussolini.Goldwaterwas humiliated, and Johnson won in a landslide.In 1968, it was CFR Nixon’s turn against CFR Democrat Hubert Humphrey. In 1972,CFR President Nixon took on CFR Democratic challenger George McGovern. In 1976,CFR Republican President/ contender Gerald Ford opposed CFR/TC challengerCarter. In 1980, President Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan, who, althoughnot a CFR member, had in George H.W. Bush a CFR Vice President. Reagan, afterbecoming President, quickly staffed his office with 313 CFR members. As aninteresting side note, the independent third-party candidate in the 1980elections, John Anderson, was also a CFR member.In 1984, President Reagan contested Democratic CFR member, Walter Mondale. In1988, Republican contender for the office of the President, George H.W. Bush,ex-CIA boss and a CFR member took on Michael Dukakis, the little-known CFRGovernor of Massachusetts. In 1992, President Bush faced an obscure governorfrom the backward state of Arkansas as his competitor for the presidency. Thiswas Bill Clinton, a Bilderberger as well as a member of the CFR and theTrilateral Commission. Wlien Clinton became President, he employed almost 100CFR members in his administration. Furthermore, the team of Clinton and Gore wasfinanced and supported by the CFR membership and agenda.In 1996, Clinton fought off a challenge from a Republican veteran and anotherCFR member, Robert Dole. In 2000, CFR Democrat A1 Gore squared off against TexasGovernor George W. Bush, son of the former President George H.W. Bush. George W.Bush, who won, was not a CFR member, but as is always the case, he wassurrounded by the Establishment in the corridors of power. Bush’s insider teamincluded Condoleezza Rice, Dick Cheney, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, LewisLibby, Colin Powell and Robert Zoellick — all CFR members. In 2004, incumbentBush won, against the CFR and Bilderberg challenger. Democrat John Kerry.In fact, from 1928 to 1972, a CFR member has won every presidential election(except Lyndon Johnson who more than compensated the Establishment by fillingmost of the top positions in Government withThe True Story of the Bilderberg GroupCFR members). George H.W. Bush had 387 members of the CFR and TC in hisAdministration. Nixon, at the beginning of his Administration, placed 115 CFRmembers in key positions in the Executive Branch. Of the first 82 names on alist prepared to help President Kennedy staff his State Department, 63 belongedto the CFR, according to Arnold Beichman’s report in the September 1, 1961edition of the Christum Science Monitor. It was simply titled, “Council onForeign Relations.” Indeed, the CFR has served as a virtual employment agencyfor the federal government under both Democrats and Republicans.Columnist Edith Kermit Roosevelt, granddaughter of President Theodore Roosevelt,had this to say about them: “Most people are unaware of the existence of thislegitimate Mafia. Yet, the power of the Establishment makes itself felt from theprofessor, who seeks a foundation grant, to the candidate for a cabinet post orState department job. It affects the nation’s policies in almost every area.”George Wallace, American Democratic presidential candidate on four occasions inthe 1960s and ’70s, made famous a slogan: “There is not a dime’s worth ofdifference between the Democrat and Republican parties.” And he was right.Governmental policies never seem to change even though significant“philosophical” differences have taken place within the ruling government. Thereason for this, claims Gary Allen, one of America’s “conspiracy-niched”investigative reporters, in his brilliant and now out-of-print best seller. TheRockefeller File, is that “while grassroots Democrats and Republicans generallyhave greatly differing views on the economy, political policies, and federalactivities, as you climb the sides of the political pyramid, the two partiesbecome more and more alike.”Whether a Democrat, a Republican, a Conservative or a Liberal is in power, theopposing rhetorics spouted by the candidates apparently have little to do withwho actually wins the elections: the decision makers who pull the strings staythe same, because cabinet seats are always held by CFR members. Even as U.S.presidents come and go, the CFR’s power and agenda remain the same.And the average voter is no fool. The public realizes something is amiss.Political surveys illustrate a growing perception that nothing changes ingovernment no matter how you vote. This widespread observation has led toreduced voter turnout at election time and a restless cynicism among citizens.Crossover PartnersNo matter how the public feels, the objective of the hardcore inner circle ofthe CFR has not changed since its founding in 1921 at the Majestic Hotel inParis. In the 50th anniversary issue of the CFR’s official quarterlypublication, Foreign Affairs, Kingman Brewster, Jr., U.S. Ambassador to GreatBritain and president of Yale University, contributed the leading article:“Reflections on Our National Purpose.” As a CFR member, Brewster did not backaway from stating the Council’s goal: “Our national purpose should be to abolishAmerican nationality and to take some risks in order to invite others to pooltheir sovereignty with ours.”^^.-’^“'These risks include disarming to the point where America would behelpless against the “peace-keeping” forces of a global UN government. Rather,America would happily surrender its sovereignty to the world government in theinterests of what he called the “world community,” or what today’s media likesto call “the international community.”These secret proposals reflect the work of dozens of different agencies andcommissions, and are now being vigorously advanced by the Commission on GlobalGovernance. Its report, entitled Our Global Neighbourhood, is a blueprint forthe UN’s future role as a global super-government.^^Another contributor to Foreign Affairs, Richard N. Gardner, former deputyassistant Secretary of State, in April 1974 wrote, “In short, the ‘house ofworld order’ will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the topdown.... An end run around national sovereignty, eroding it piece by piece, willaccomplish much more than the old fashioned assault.”James Warburg, son of CFR founder Paul Warburg, and a member of Franklin D.Roosevelt’s “brain trust,” which was made up of individuals from outsidegovernment, including professors, lawyers, and others who came to Washington toadvise him on economic affairs, delivered blunt testimony before the SenateForeign Relations Committee on February 17, 1950: “We shall have worldgovernment whether or not you like it — by conquest or consent.”And most tellingly, in an address to the Bilderberg Group at Evian, France, May21, 1992 — and transcribed from a tape recording made by a Swiss delegate,Michael Ringier, Publisher and CEO of Ringier Inc. — Henry Kissinger said,“Today, Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restoreorder; tomorrow, they willThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupbe grateFuL This is especially true if they were told there was an outsidethreat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our veryexistence. It is then that all people of the world will plead with world leadersto deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown.When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willinglyrelinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by theirworld government.”In his book. The Future of Federalism, Nelson Rockefeller proclaimed, “No nationtoday can defend its freedom, or fulfill the needs and aspirations of its ownpeople, from within its own borders or through its own resources alone.... Andso the nation-state, standing alone, threatens, in many ways, to seem asanachronistic as the Greek city-states eventually became in ancient times.”Rockefeller might have been referring to the wrong-headed strategic policiesunder Pericles and Alcibiades, which got Athens into the disastrousPeloponnesian War that brought on the collapse and the self-ruin of its GoldenAge. These stratagems are easily comparable to the current U.S. foreign policyin its calamitous advance.In fact, the CFR was apparently planning the New World Order before 1942. Aneditorial on page two in the Baltimore News-Post, Monday December 8, 1941 — theday after Pearl Harbor was bombed — predicted there would be a new world league,which would formulate a “basic declaration of the rights of man ... and toprotect those rights, the system will have the power to deal with and punishindividuals in some cases'' [emphasis added].Furthermore, “The UN began with a group of CFR members called the InformalAgenda Group. They drafted the original proposal for the UN, and called in threeCFR attorneys, who declared it was Constitutional. They then presented theproposal to President Roosevelt, who announced it the very next day to thepublic. When the United Nations held its founding conference in San Francisco,more than forty of the American delegates were CFR members.”^*Later, the United Nations did adopt a declaration of human rights. Then,international law was only concerned with how national authorities exercisedregulation of their own individual citizens. Now, the UN has the right to kidnapindividuals within their own national borders and bring them to trial at TheHague. Though war crimes are heinous, it is up to each nation victimized by suchcrimes to try itsCrossover Partnersown people under its own laws. Yet, there have been no protests of this blatanttravesty of international justice.Again in 1941, Quincy Wright, Ph.D., a CFR member and a specialist ininternational law at the University of Chicago, made the earliest and cleareststatement of how he viewed the “New World Order” — one government over theentire world that would limit national sovereignty and the independence ofindividual nations. That this declaration at the outset of World War 11 receivedno criticism nor comparison to Hitler’s feared “New Order” demonstrates howdeep-rooted American isolation was at the time. No one recognized the similarityin the goals of the Nazi state to this ideology.In discussing Dr. Wright’s ideas in his lecture on the “New World Order,” TerryBoardman told a packed auditorium of almost 1,500 people at Rudolf Steiner Housein London in October 1998 that Wright envisioned three continental systems: a“United States of Europe,” an Asiatic system and a Pan-American union. Wrightalso forecast that each continental system would have a common military forceand that national military forces would be greatly reduced or outlawed.Still, with the advent of a world government, a world army and a world currency,why would the Rockefeller family want to surrender U.S. sovereignty andgovernment power, which they already control, as well as their wealth, to thecontrols and dictates of a World Government? Wouldn’t such a World Governmentthreaten their financial power and therefore be the last thing on earth theywould wish to support?Yes, of course, unless the Rockefellers, the Bilderberg Group, the Council onForeign Relations and the Trilateral Commission expect the coming WorldGovernment to be under their control. In a letter to an associate on November21, 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote, “The real truth of the matteris, as you and 1 know, that a financial element in the large centers has ownedthe government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson.”If this is their ultimate goal — to create a single globalized marketplace,ruled by a world government (which in turn controls its courts, schools, and thepeople’s reading habits and very thoughts), policed by a world army, financiallyregulated by a world bank (via a single global currency) — then we can illafford to ignore what is happening to us and the world we live in.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupIt is imperative to understand that the conferences and meetings of the Councilon Foreign Relations, Council of the Americas, Royal Institute for InternationalAffairs, Institute of Pacific Relations, Trilateral Commission, GorbachevFoundation, Bill Gates Foundation, etc. are not places where major decisions aremade or new strategies embraced. Rather, these social gatherings capitalize onthe CFR’s use of its special discussion groups and study groups to advance itspolicies.According to G. William Domhoff, a writer and an investigator of methods used bythe elite organizations to strive to develop consensus, the CFR has historicallyoperated in “small groups of about twenty-five, who bring together leaders fromthe six conspirator categories (industrialists, financiers, ideologues,military, professional specialists — lawyers, medical doctors, etc. — andorganized labor) for detailed discussions of specific topics in the area offoreign aff airs.” In his 1970 book. The Higher Circles, he discussed “how thepower elite make foreign policy”: “Discussion groups explore problems in ageneral way, trying to define issues and alternatives. Such groups often lead toa study group as the next stage. Study groups revolve around the work of aCouncil research fellow (financed by Carnegie, Ford and Rockefeller) or a staffmember.”In a 1968 discussion group, former CIA Director of Plans Richard Bissell, whowas also a Ford Foundation consultant, laid out increasing needs for theinterplay between CFR members and covert actions to be more discreet when theCIA turned to Council members to act as covers for clandestine operations. “Ifthe agency is to be effective, it will have to make use of private institutionson an expanding scale, though those relations which have been ‘blown’ cannot beresurrected. We need to operate under deeper cover, with increased attention tothe use of‘cut-outs’ |intermediaries]. The CIA’s interface with the rest of theworld needs to be better protected. If various groups hadn’t been aware of thesource of their funding, the damage subsequent to disclosure might have been farless than occurred. The CIA Interface wi th various private groups, includingbusiness and student groups, must be remedied.”The CFR’s influence seamlessly extends throughout the American way of life. In 1he Higher Circles, Domhoff also quotes political scientist Lester Milbrath onhow well this is being achieved: “The Council on Foreign Relations, while notfinanced by government, works so closely with it that it is difficult todistinguish Council actions stimulated byCrossover Partnersgovernment from autonomous actions... the most important sources of income areleading corporations and major foundations.”As to the foundations Milbrath mentions, the major contributors over the yearshave been the Rockefeller Foundation, the Carnegie Foundation, and the FordFoundation. “All foundations, which support the CFR,” Domhoff concludes in TheHigher Circles, “are in turn directed by men from Bechtel Construction, ChaseManhattan, Kimberly-Clark, Monsanto Chemical, and dozens of other corporations.Further, to complete the circle, most foundation directors are members of theCFR In the early 1960s, Dan Smoot found that twelve of twenty RockefellerFoundation trustees, ten of fifteen Ford Foundation trustees, and ten offourteen Carnegie Foundation trustees were members of the CFR”''picture37 [images/picture37.jpg]MichaelBloombergVernon JordanPaula ZahnPeter G.

They determine what we see on television, hear onthe radio and read in newspapers, magazines, books, or on the Internet.Bilderberg has, at one time or another, had representatives of all major U.S.and European newspapers and network news outlets attend meetings. These mediapeople are invited on the condition that they promise to report nothing. This ishow the Bilderbergers sustain their news blackouts throughout the United Statesand Europe.Doing a cursory check of the Web pages of the principal international newsoutlets, we will not find even one reference to the most important group thatcounts among its members all the most important politicians, businessmen andfinanciers. Worse, there was no hint of the beginning of the Iraq hostilities,even from the press who attended a 2002 Bilderberg meeting. We’re talking aboutthe Washington Post, Newsweek, Time magazine. Wall Street Journal, the Economist— the world’s leadingThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupnewspapers knew exactly when the war was to begin and did not halfill the veryminimum of their journalistic duty.One of the more serious altercations among Bilderberg members took place at theannual 2002 meeting in a suburb of Washington D.C., between May 30 and June 2.European Bilderbergers demanded the immediate presence of U.S. Defense SecretaryDonald Rumsfeld. They wanted to hear firsthand from the Secretary about U.S. warplans. Rumsfeld, compelled to change his appointments for the day, appeared May31 before outraged European Bilderbergers to promise, in the name of the Bushgovernment, that no attack was to take place against Iraq before February orMarch 2003. Wasn’t this story sufficiently important to broadcast to the worldas front-page news?I must address an issue that dogged me through my research, investigations andactions to uncover the truth about the Bilderberg Group. I found that some of my“allies” came from “interesting” camps. When I commenced my investigation therewas a dearth of information, with next to no mainstream news coverage of theBilderberg Group. The American Free Press and before that the Spotlight were twoof the very few newspapers that have covered these secret meetings. I do notagree with most of their political views, but I found their reporting andcoverage of the Bilderberg meetings to be professional, competent and unique.It was left to the American Free Press to inform its readers in June 2002 that,according to its sources within Bilderberg, the war in Iraq had been postponeduntil March 2003, when at the time the entire world press was screaming of animpending attack programmed for the summer or early fall of 2002.^^How is it possible that Nicolas Beytout, Editor-in-Chief of Les Echos didn’tknow it? Or that Phillipe Camus, CEO of EADS, and Henri de Castries, Chairman ofAXA Insurance, might not have heard of it? Did Camus and de Castries use theinside information to proHt from it? How much did Donald Graham, the WashingtonPost CEO, know? Did he profit in any way from being party to such valuableinformation?It seems the largest periodicals such as the New York Times and the WashingtonPost, whose members form the very fiber of the Bilderberg Group, had explicitorders not to cover what would have undoubtedly been the story of summer 2002.Instead of the Iraq war, as if in unison, we got these stories:Journalistic Courtesans?“Rumsfeld Cautions Nuclear Foes”Abstract - Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said today he will try topersuade the leaders ot India and Pakistan to step back from the brink of war byreminding them that nuclear weapons are “distinctively different” from any othertool of war.Washington Post, June 6, 2002 pg. A.20“Taking the Offensive”Abstract - Many observers interpreted Mr. Bush’s talk of taking “the battle tothe enemy” as stage-setting for a possible military campaign against Iraq, whichclearly fits in his category of “evil and lawless regimes” for which“containment is not possible.”Washington Post, June 4, 2002. pg.

Friedman,[journalist, Bilderberg member]“U.S. must act first to battle terror, Bush tells cadets”Abstract - Pres. Bush delivers toughly worded speech to 1,000 graduates atUnited States Military Academy that seems aimed at preparing Americans forpotential war with Iraq.New York Times, June 2, 2002, Section 1, Page 1, Column 6Elisabeth BumillerAs an interesting aside, Jim Hoagland, William Safire and Tomas L Friedman areall Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists as well as members of theBilderberger-interlocked Council on Foreign Relations. In the past, they haveattended Bilderberger Conferences but are sworn to secrecy. It appears they willnever reveal what has transpired at the Bilderberg meetings to the Americanpublic.The Ainericcin Free Press' diplomatic correspondent at the UN, ChristopherBollen, asked a group of journalists waiting for a routineThe True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupconference to start, “Why is anything related to Bilderberg edited out by themost ‘respectable’ editors of national newspapers?” His question was met withironic laughter in the pressroom.“The Bilderbergers have been removed from our assignment list years ago byexecutive order,” said Anthony Holder, a former UN correspondent for the LondonEconomist, the leading international business weekly.“We are barely aware of the Bilderbergers’ existence, and we don’t report ontheir activities,” asserted William Glasgow, senior writer responsible forcovering such international organizations at Business Week. “One cannot help butbe a little suspicious when priorities for the future of mankind are beingconsidered by those who have real influence over that future, in total secret.“The involvement of the Rockefellers with the media has multiple implications.One is that the Rockefeller gang’s plans for monopolistic World Government arenever, but never, discussed in the machines of mass disinformation. The mediadecides what the issues will be in the country. They can turn on the povertyissue or turn it off The same holds true for population explosion, pollution,peace, detente, or whatever,” wrote American investigative journalist, thenow-deceased Gary Allen, in The Rockefeller File. “The media can take a man likeRalph Nader and make him an instant folk hero. Or they can take an enemy of theRockefellers (like Goldwater) and create the image that he is a cretin, abuffoon, a bigot, or a dangerous paranoid.”It is interesting to note that R^dph Nader, a perennial “independent”presidential candidate, “much admired for his anti-establishment stance,” isfinanced by the Rockefeller network in his attempt to destroy the freeenterprise system. Principal Nader financiers are the Ford Foundation and theField Foundation, both CFR-interlocked. According to a Business Week articlereprinted in the Congressional Record of March 10, 1971, “John D. Rockefeller IVis an advisor to Nader.”With money, the Rockefellers gained great influence over the media. With themedia, the family gained sway over public opinion. With the pulse of publicopinion, they gained deep influence in politics. And with this politics ofsubtle corruption, they are taking control of the nation.According to several sources, David Rockefeller made the following comments atthe 1991 Baden-Baden meeting: “We are grateful to theJournalistic Courtesans?Washington Post, the New York Times, Time magazine and other great publications,whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises ofdiscretion for almost forty years.” He went on to explain: “It would have beenimpossible for us to develop our plan for the world if we had been subjected tothe lights of publicity during those years. But, the world is more sophisticatedand prepared to march towards a world government. The supranational sovereigntyof an intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable to the nationalauto determination practiced in past centuries.”Is it really, Mr. Rockefeller? Can Etienne Davignon’s words be taken at facevalue? Remember what Mr. Davignon had to say during a 2005 BBC interview: “Idon’t think a global ruling class exists. Business influences society, andpolitics influences society — that’s purely common sense. It’s not that businesscontests the right of democratically elected leaders to lead.”However, a comment made to the Bilderberger elite by George Ball during apresentation titled “Internationalization of Business” at the April 26-28, 1968,Bilderberg meeting at Mont Tremblant, Canada, provides a far more truthful andinsightful glimpse into the Group’s economic orientation. Ball, who was theUndersecretary of State for Economic Affairs under JFK and Lyndon Johnson, aSteering Committee member of the Bilderberg Group as well as a Senior ManagingDirector for Lehman Brothers and Kuhn Loeb Inc., defined what the newBilderberger policy of globalization was going to be, and how it would shape theGroup’s policy.“In essence,” writes Pierre Beaudry in Synarchy Movement of Empire, “Ballpresented an outline of the advantages of a new-colonial world economic orderbased on the concept of a world company, and described some of the obstaclesthat needed to be eliminated for its success. According to Ball, the first andmost important thing that had to be eliminated was the archaic politicalstructure of the nation stateTIn other words. Ball was calling for a return to the old colonial system butthis time built on the concept of a world company. “To be productive,” Beaudryquotes Ball, “we must begin our inquiry by explicitly recognizing the lack ofphasing between development of the world company — a concept responding tomodern needs — and the continued existence of an archaic political structure ofnation states.The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupmostly small or of only medium size, which is evolving only at glacier pace inresponse to new world requirements of scope and scale.”Beaudry cuts to the chase in summarizing Ball’s speech: “For Ball, the verystructure of the nation state, and the idea of the commonwealth, or of a generalwelfare of a people, represented the main obstacle against any attempt of freelylooting the planet, especially the weak and poor nations of the world, andrepresented the most important impediment to the creation of a neo-colonialworld empire. The priority of the world company is obviously based oninternational free trade without restraint; that is, trade measured by theBritish standards of profit of buying cheap and selling dear. The problem isthat national governments have priorities, which are different from and contraryto those of a looting company.”^^Mr. Ball let a big rabbit out of the hat when, according to page 39 of aBilderberg transcript from the 1968 meeting at Mont Tremblant, he wistfullyasked, “Where does one find a legitimate base for the power of corporatemanagements to make decisions that can profoundly affect the economic life ofnations to whose governments they have only limited responsibility?”In other words, Mssrs. Rockefeller and Davignon, what Mr. Ball would like toknow is how does one establish a Halliburton type of world company, which wouldgreatly surpass, in authority, any government on the planet? How does oneestablish David Rockefeller’s Utopian ideal of the world, where “supranationalsovereignty of world bankers supersedes national auto-determination practiced inpast centuries”?In fact, it is quite simple.Current representative democracy works on the basis of an “elected” government —a Head of State and a sizable deliberative body — which can be dumped any timeit may be decided by “orchestrating a crisis,” along with a third power (calledan “independent central banking system”) in charge of its finances.In the United States, this “independent” banking system is known as the FederalReserve System, a privately owned bank system interlocked with theBilderbergers. In Europe, the independent banking system is run through theEuropean Central Bank, whose monetary policies are put together by the leadingmembers of the Bilderberg elite, including Jean Claude Trichet.In Britain, this “independent” system is run by the Bank of England, whosemembers are also full-time members of the Bilderberger inner circle.Journalistic Courtesans?The “independent central banking system” controls the issuance of currency;controls national credit and interest rates; and, any time the governmentdispleases it, it uses its power to orchestrate the overthrow of the government.Margaret Thatcher, British Prime Minister, was removed from her post by her ownTory party because she opposed the transfer of British sovereignty to theEuropean Super-State designed by the Bilderbergers.According to Beaudry, “This is what Kuhn Loeb and Lehman Brothers have beenbuilding worldwide, by ways of merger and acquisitions, from the 1960s untiltoday. In the past decades, the entire deregulation policy of U.S. industriesand banking was precisely set up in response to this blueprint scenario forcreating giant corporations for a new empire whose intention is nothing short ofperpetual war.”^^The MediaP ast media invitees included Katharine Graham, now deceased, owner andchairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post; Donald E. Graham,Publisher, the Washington Post;]un Hoagland and Charles Krauthammer, bothcolumnists for the Washington Post; Andrew Knight, News Corporation director ofKnight-Ridder; Arthur Sulzberger, New York Times editor and Council on ForeignRelations member; Robert L. Bartley, vice president of the Wall Street Journaland member of both the Council on Foreign Relations and the TrilateralCommission; Mortimer B. Zuckerman, chairman and editor-in-chief of U.S. News andWorld Report, New York’s Daily News, and Atlantic Monthly, also a Council onForeign Relations member; William F.

A more extensive list is provided in an endnote.The ideas and policies that come out of the Bilderberg annual meetings are usedto generate news in the leading periodicals and news groups of the world. Thepoint is to make the prevalent opinions of the Bilderbergers so appealing thatthey become public policy and to pressure world leaders into submitting to the“needs of the Masters of the Universe.” The “free world press” is completely atthe mercy of the Bilderbergers disseminating the agreed-upon propaganda.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupWhat is most disturbing is that publicly traded corporations try to keep theBilderberger guest-list a secret, and the corporate press scarcely reports onthe event at all. The likes of Microsoft, AT&T, Bechtel, Cisco, Compaq and PriceWaterhouse Coopers have nothing to fear from the press. Never mind thatMicrosoft and NBC co-own MSNBC cable network. In fact, among the frequentlyinvited Bilderberg guests can be found the name of Anthony Ridder ofKnight-Ridder, Inc., America’s second-largest newspaper chain, which owns suchpublications as the Detroit Free Press, the Miami Flerald and the PhiladelphiaInquirer.In the 1993 August/September edition, the prestigious Dutch magazine Exposureoutlined disturbing details about how the Tavistock Institute for BehaviouralAnalysis, premier behavioural research center in the world, planned to controlthe boards of the three major and most prestigious television networks in theUnited States: NBC, CBS and ABC. All three television networks came as spin-offsfrom the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). These organizations andinstitutions that theoretically are in “competition” with each other — this ispart of the “independence” that ensures Americans enjoy unbiased news — are infact closely interfaced and interlocked with countless companies and banks,making it an almost impossible task to untangle them.According to then-U.S. Representative Bernie Sanders, NBC’s owner GeneralElectric is “one of the largest corporations in the world — and one with a longhistory of anti-union activity. GE, a major contributor to the Republican Party,has substantial financial interests in weapons manufacturing, finance, nuclearpower and many other industries. Former CEO Jack Welch was one of the leaders inshutting down American plants and moving them to low-wage countries like Chinaand Mexico.NBC is a subsidiary of RCA, a media conglomerate. On RCA’s board sits ThorntonBradshaw, president of Atlantic Richfield Oil, and member of the World WildlifeFund, the Club of Rome, the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, and theCouncil on Foreign Relations. Bradshaw is also chairman of NBC.RCA’s most legendary role, however, was the service it provided to BritishIntelligence during World War II. Of particular note: RCA’s President DavidSarnoff moved to London at the same time Sir William Stephenson (of Intrepidfame) moved into the RCA building in NewJournalistic Courtesans?York. During the war, Sarnoff was Eisenhower’s top communications expert,overseeing the construction of a radio transmitter that was powerful enough toreach all of the allied forces in Europe. He campaigned for, and received, thehonorary title of Brigadier General, and thereafter preferred to be known as“General Sarnoff.” Today, the RCA directorate is made up of British-Americanestablishment figures that belong to other organizations such as the CFR, NATO,the Club of Rome, the Trilateral Commission, Bilderbergers, Round Table, etc.Among the NBC directors named in the Exposure article were John Brademas (CFR,TC, Bilderberg), a director of the Rockefeller Foundation; Peter G. Peterson(CFR), a former head of Kuhn, Loeb & Co. (Rothschild), and a former U.S.Secretary of Commerce; Robert Cizik, chairman of RCA and of First City Bancorp,which was identified in Congressional testimony as a Rothschild bank; Thomas O.Paine, president of Northrup Co. (the big defense contractor) and director ofthe Institute of Strategic Studies in London; Donald Smiley, a director of twoMorgan Companies, Metropolitan Life and U.S. Steel; and the above-mentionedThornton Bradshaw, chairman of RCA, director of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund,Atlantic Richfield, and the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies (both of thelatter headed by a Bilderberger, Robert O. Anderson). Clearly the NBC board isconsiderably influenced by the Rockefeller-Rothschild-Morgan troika, leadingexponents of the New World Order initiative.ABC is owned by the Disney Corporation, “which produces toys and products indeveloping countries where they provide their workers with atrocious wages andworking conditions.It has 153 TV stations. Chase Manhattan Bank controls 6.7% ofABC’s stock — enough to give it a controlling interest. Chase, through its trustdepartment, controls 14% of CBS and 4.5% of RCA. Instead of three competingtelevision networks called NBC, CBS, and ABC, what we really have is theRockefeller Broadcasting Company, the Rockefeller Broadcasting System, and theRockefeller Broadcasting Consortium.On the ABC board of directors is Ray Adam, director of J.P. Morgan, MetropolitanLife (Morgan), and Morgan Guaranty Trust; Frank Cary, chairman of IBM, anddirector of J.P. Morgan and the Morgan Guaranty Trust; Donald C. Cook (CFR,Bilderberg), general partner of hazard Freres banking house, whose executivesfrequently attend Bilderberg meetings; John T. Connor (CFR) of the Kuhn,The True Story of the Bitderberg GroupLoeb (Rothschild) law firm, Gravath, Swaine and Moore, former Secretary of theNavy, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, director of the Chase Manhattan Bank(Rockefeller/ Rothschild), General Motors, and chairman of the J. Henry SchroderBank; Thomas M. Macioce, director of Manufacturers Hanover Trust (Rothschild);George Jenkins, chairman of Metropolitan Life (Morgan) and Citibank (Rothschildconnections); Martin J. Schwab, director of Manufacturers Hanover (Rothschild);Alan Greenspan (CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg), chairman of the FederalReserve Board, director of J.P. Morgan, Morgan Guaranty Trust, Hoover Institute,Time magazine, and General Foods; Ulric Haynes, Jr., director of the FordFoundation and Marine Midland Bank.Isn’t it strange how the same Rockefeller-Rothschild-Morgan( characters on the board of the ABC network, which, we are told, is independentof NBC, appear to represent the competition? ABC was taken over by CitiesCommunications, whose most prominent director is Robert Roosa (CFR, Bilderberg),senior partner of Brown Brothers Harriman, which has close ties with the Bank ofEngland. Roosa and David Rockefeller are credited with selecting Paul Volcker tochair the Federal Reserve Board./ CBS is o wned by Viacom, which has over 200 TV and 255 radio ‘ affiliatesnationwide. This huge media conglomerate owns, amongother companies, MTV, Showtime, Nickelodeon, VHI, TNN, CMT, 39 broadcasttelevision stations, 184 radio stations. Paramount Pictures and Blockbuster Inc.As an American intelligence officer, CBS founder William Paley was trained inmass brainwashing techniques during World War II at the Tavistock Institute inEngland.The financial expansion of CBS was supervised for a long time by Brown BrothersHarriman and its senior partner, Prescott Bush (father and grandfather toPresidents), who was a CBS director. The CBS board included Chairman Paley, forwhom Prescott Bush personally organized the money to buy the company; HaroldBrown (CFR), executive director of the Trilateral Commission, and formerSecretary of the Air Force and of Defense of the U.S.; Roswell Gilpatric (CFR,Bilderberg), from the Kuhn, Loeb (Rothschild) law firm, Cravath, Swaine, andMoore, and former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York; Henry B.Schnacht, director of the Chase Manhattan Bank (Rockefeller/Rothschild), theCouncil on Foreign Relations, BrookingsJournalistic Courtesans?Institution, and Committee for Economic Development; Michel C. Bergerac,chairman of Revlon, and director of Manufacturers Hanover Bank (Rothschild);James D. Wolfensohn (CFR, Trilateral Commission, Bilderberg), former head of J.Henry Schroder Bank, who has close links with the Rothschilds and theRockefellers, and who in 1995 was successfully nominated to head the World Bankby Bill Clinton; Franklin A. Thomas (CFR), head of the Rockefeller-controlledFord Foundation; Newton D. Minow (CFR), director of the Rand Corporation and,among many others, the Ditchley Foundation, which is closely linked with theTavistock Institute in London and the Bilderberg Group. The former president ofCBS was Dr. Frank Stanton (CFR), who is also a trustee of the RockefellerFoundation and Carnegie Institution. So, are the Rothschild and the Rockefellerfamilies, who are leading groups in the tightly controlled field ofcommunications, answering directly to the Bilderbergers?FOX News Channel, part of the FOX network, is owned by Rupert Murdoch, who ownsa significant portion of the world’s media. His network has close ties to theRepublican Party and among his “fair and balanced” commentators is NewtGingrich, former GOP Republican House speaker. Murdoch, needless to say, is aluminary in the secret Bilderberg Group. He has most recently added the WallStreet Journal to his empire.All these networks are closely interlocked with Bilderberg, the Council onForeign Relations and the Trilateral Commission. How, then, can it possibly beclaimed that the majority of Americans get their news from independent sources?The Logan Act:§ 953. Private correspondence with foreign governments.Any citizen of the United States, wherever he may be, who, without authority otthe United States, directly or indirectly commences or carries on anycorrespondence or intercourse with any foreign government or any officer oragent thereof, with intent to influence the measures or conduct of any foreigngovernment or of any officer or agent thereof, in relation to any disputes orcontroversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures of the UnitedStates, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years,or both.This section shall not abridge the right of a citizen to apply himself, or hisagent, to any foreign government, or the agents thereof, for redress of anyinjury which he may have sustained from such government or any of its agents orsubjects.1 Stat. 613, January 30, 1799, codilied at 18 U.S.C. § 953 (2004)Chapter TwelveENFORCED DISARMAMENTU nknown to almost everyone, the U.S. government, sponsored by the Council onForeign Relations, has made a secret commitment to surrender irrevocably to theUnited Nations the means of protecting its national sovereignty, and,ultimately, to confiscate all of the weapons owned by its own citizens, as partof a planned future global disarmament program. Except that the “future,” as faras this particular program is concerned, appears to be very near indeed.Some prestigious members of the American political community fully agree withthis policy. CFR fellow Walter Rostow, JFK’s adviser in the Viet Nam War, wrotein his book The United States in the World Arena, that “it is a legitimateAmerican national objective to see removed from all nations — including theUnited States — the right to use substantial military force to pursue their owninterests. Since this right is the root of national sovereignty, it is thereforean American interest to see an end to nationhood as it has been historicallydefined.”As a State Department official, heading its policy-planning council, Walt Rostowauthored the infamous Rostow Papers, which laid out these goals for Americanforeign policy: unilateral disarmament, world government and accommodation withthe Communist world. Was Walter Wliitman Rostow a Communist, an anti-American ora one-world globalist? His father was a Marxist revolutionary in Russia. Hisbrother, Eugene Debs Rostow, was named after prominent labor organizer andSocialist leader Eugene Debs. Two of his aunts were members of the CommunistParty. Walter Rostow, on three separate occasions wasThe True Story of the Bilderberg Grouprejected for employment in the State Department by the Eisenhoweradministration. U.S. Air Force intelligence branded him a security risk. The CIAhad dropped him from a sensitive contract. He had long consorted with CommunistParty members, including known Soviet spies. To get him on board as an adviser,the Kennedy administration had to fire Otto Otepka, head of security for theState Department.As startling as these assertions may appear, they are fully supported by U.S.government documents.Although “officially” released in September 1961, one document - DEPARTMENT OFSTATE PUBLICATION 7277, published in unabridgedform in the 35-page “BLUEPRINT FOR THE PEACE RACE” by the U.S. ARMS CONTROL ANDDISARMAMENT AGENCY (PUBLICATION #4,GENERAL SERIES #3, MAY 1962) - had long been extremely difficult to track down,due to its sensitive nature and far-reaching consequences. Since its 1962publication, the document has become “unavailable,” according to numerousresponses to inquiries I made to the U.S. Navy, CIA, Army, etc. I was finallyshown it by a captain of the United States counter-intelligence division, whorisked his job and his life in getting in touch with me and later showing themto me. Ironically, it is now easily found on the Internet.FREEDOM FROM WAR: THE UNITED STATES PROGRAM FOR GENERAL AND COMPLETE DISARMAMENTIN A PEACEFUL WORLD DEPARTMENT OF STATE PUBLICATION 7277, Released September1961INTRODUCTIONThis new program provides for the progressive reduction of the war-makingcapabilities of nations and the simultaneous strengthening of internationalinstitutions to settle disputes and maintain the peace. It is based on threeprinciples deemed essential to the achievement of practical progress in thedisarmament field:First, there must be immediate disarmament action.A strenuous and uninterrupted effort must be made toward the goal of general andcomplete disarmament; at the same time, it is important that specific measuresbeEnforced Disarmamentput into effect as soon as possible.Second, all disarmament obligations must be subject to effective internationalcontrols.The control organization must have the manpower, facilities, and effectivenessto assure that limitations or reductions take place as agreed.Third, adequate peace-keeping machinery must be established.There is an inseparable relationship between the scaling down of nationalarmaments on the one hand and the building up of international peace-keepingmachinery and institutions on the other. Nations are unlikely to shed theirmeans of self-protection in the absence of alternative ways to safeguard theirlegitimate interests. This can only be achieved through the progressivestrengthening of international institutions under the United Nations and bycreating a United Nations Peace force to enforce the peace as the disarmamentprocess proceeds.DISARMAMENT GOAL AND OBJECTIVES The overall goal of the United States is a free,secure, and peaceful world of independent states adhering to common standards ofjustice and international conduct and subjecting the use of force to the rule oflaw; a world that has achieved general and complete disarmament under effectiveinternational control; and a world in which adjustment to change takes place inaccordance with the principles of the United Nations.In order to make possible the achievement of that goal, the program sets forththe following specific objectives toward which nations should direct theirefforts:•The disbanding of all national armed forces and the prohibition of theirre-establishment in any form whatsoever other than those required to preserveinternal order and for contributions to a United Nations Peace Force.•The elimination from national arsenals of all armaments, including all weaponsof mass destructionThe True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupand the means For their delivery, other than those required For a United NationsPeace Force and for maintaining internal order:•The institution of effective means For the enforcement of internationalagreements, For the enforcement of international disputes, and for theprinciples of the United Nations;• The establishment and effective operation of an International Disarmamentwithin the framework of the United Nations to insure compliance at all timeswith all disarmament obligations.GOVERNING PRINCIPLES•As states relinquish their arms, the United Nations must be progressivelystrengthened in order to improve its capacity to assure international securityand the peaceFul settlement of disputes.DISARMAMENT STAGESThe program provides For progressive disarmament steps to take place in threestages and For the simultaneous strengthening of international institutions.FIRST STAGEThe first stage contains measures which would significantly reduce thecapabilities of nations to wage aggressive war.• Arms and armed forces would be reduced: The armed forces of the United Statesand the Soviet Union would be limited to 2.1 million men each (with appropriatelevels not exceeding that amount For other militarily significant states);levels of armaments would be correspondingly reduced and their production wouldbe limited.•UN peace-keeping powers would be strengthened: Measures would be taken todevelop and strengthen United Nations arrangements For arbitration. For thedevelopment oF international law, and For the establishment in Stage II of apermanent UN Peace Force.Enforced Disarmament•An International Disarmament Organization would be established for effectiveverification of the disarmament program: Its functions would be expandedprogressively as disarmament proceeds. It would certify to all states thatagreed reductions have taken place and that retained forces and armaments do notexceed permitted levels.It would determine the transition from one stage to the next.• Further substantial reductions in the armed forces, armaments, and militaryestablishments of states, including strategic nuclear weapons delivery vehiclesand countering weapons;•The manufacture of armaments would be prohibited except for those of agreedtypes and quantities to be used by the UN Peace Force and those required tomaintain internal order. All other armaments would be destroyed or converted topeaceful purposes.•The peace-keeping capabilities of the United Nations would be sufficientlystrong and the obligations of all states under such arrangements sufficientlyfar-reaching as to assure peace and the just settlement of differences in adisarmed world.Set forth as the objectives of a program of general and complete disarmament, ina peaceful world:(a) The disbanding of all national armed forces and the prohibition of theirreestablishment in any form whatsoever, other than those required to preserveinternal order and for contributions to a United Nations Peace Force;(b) As states relinquish arms, the United Nations shall be progressivelystrengthened in order to improve its capacity to assure international securityand the peaceful settlement of differences as well as to facilitate thedevelopment of international cooperation in common tasks for the benefit ofmankind.[emphases added]The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupUnder Presidential Decision Directive No. 25, and in conjunction with theDepartment oi State Publication 1211, the United Nations “Partnership for Peace”program serves to cement people to relationships between the citizens ot theUnited States and the global military of the UN establishments.Top Secret Military PlansP age 554 of 1982 edition of the U.S. Code, Volume 9, Public Law #87-297 (1961)was signed by President Kennedy in 1962; it has received eighteen subsequentupdates, and its provisions have been steadily implemented by every Presidentsince.Public Law # 87-297 (1961) calls for the elimination of U.S. national forces andfurther declares that “no one may possess a firearm or lethal weapon exceptpolice or military personnel.” This law is taught and explained in the NationalWar College and various U.S. Armed Forces Academies.What does it imply? That the New World Order will require an Army, and it willbe formed under the UN banner.On page 555 of Public Law #87-297 (1961), “disarmament” is defined aselimination of U.S. Forces and absolute restrictions on privately-owned “deadlyweapons”; again, on page 557, Sections (a) and (d) require the U.S. to eliminateits Armed Forces; page 558 deals with “policy formulation,” i.e. theaccomplishment of these goals.\"^^Ironically, it was Alger Hiss, who would be convicted as a Soviet spy, who setup the United Nations with his U.S. State Department colleagues. He served as atemporary UN Secretary-General as well as resident of the Carnegie Endowment forInternational Peace and is credited with establishing the UN Department ofPolitical and Security Affairs, which would have jurisdiction over all future UNmilitary operations.Hiss’ influence shows up in the fine print of the rules and regulationsgoverning UN military operations. One rule stated that the head of this UNdepartment would always be a Soviet citizen, military officer, or persondesignated by the Soviets. This was the case for the first 53 years, in whichthe following fourteen Communists chaired the vital UN position ofUndersecretary-General of Political and Security Council Affairs. The firstselected to hold the post at the 35^^^ plenary meeting on October 24, 1946, wasArkady Sobolev:Enforced Disarmament1946-49 Arkady Sobolev 1949-53 Konstantin Zinchenko1953- 54 Ilya Tchernychev1954- 57 Dragoslav Protitch 1960-62 Georgy Arkadev1962- 63 E.D.

Safronchuk 1992-97 Vladimir PetrovskyThe only appointee with no Soviet ties is the present chairman, KieranPrendergast of the United Kingdom, who was appointed in 1997. Shortlythereafter, he became a Bilderberg Group member at the Turnburry meeting inScotland in 1998.picture43 [images/picture43.jpg]Averell Harriman, Dean Acheson, John McCloy and David E.

Since 1947 there have been 14 Secretaries of Defense on the Council onForeign Relations and/or Trilateral Commission membership list.One undercover FBI agent once explained it to me this way: “President Clintonhas appointed three Secretaries of Defense — William Cohen, William Perry, andLes Aspin. Under Secretary for International Security Affairs Lynn EtheridgeDavis has been coordinating Psychological Operations under all three. Davis hasbeen involved with the U.S. Intelligence community and a part of everyAdministration from the ’70s through the ’90s. Davis, Clinton and Perry areTrilateral Commission members. Davis, Clinton, Cohen, and Aspin all belong tothe Council on Foreign Relations. Davis is also a Vice President at DavidRockefeller’s Chase Manhattan Bank.“Now,” my FBI source continued, “with whom do you suppose Lynn Etheridge Davis’loyalties lie?”Davis once published a book, in 1974, titled. The Cold War Begins:Soviet-Anierican Conflict Over Eastern Europe. It contained this chillingsentence: “The most important step would be for government to place volunteermilitary forces under UN command.”Is it any wonder that so many honest and patriotic men and women of the Americanspy community are helping to Hght the menace of the New World Order?The True Story of tfie Bii.derberg GroupSince 1940, every U.S. Secretary of State (with the sole exception of JamesByrnes, who later became Governor of South Carolina) has been a member of theCouncil on Foreign Relations and/or its offshoot, the Trilateral Commission.Also since 1940, almost every Secretary of War/ Defense has been a CFR member.Virtually every key U.S. National Security and Foreign Policy Adviser has been aCFR member for the past 80 years. Almost all of the ranking generals andadmirals, including those on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, plus many line officersare or have been members of the Council on Foreign Relations. The followinglists include both present and former members.Presidential Candidates (CFR Members)Selected by their respective parties as oflicial candidates to the Office of thePresidencyJohn W. Davis (24), Herbert Hoover (28-32), Wendell Wilkie (40), Thomas Dewey(44-48), Adlai Stevenson (52-56), Dwight Eisenhower (52-56), John F.

Bush) Robert M. Cates(06- CW. Bush).Secretaries of the Treasury (CFR Members)The Secretary of the Treasury is the chief economic and financial advisor to thegovernment appointed by the President of the United States. The followingSecretaries of the Treasury had membership on the Council on Foreign Relations:Robert B. Anderson (Eisenhower), Douglas C. Dillon (Kennedy/ Johnson), HenryHamill Fowler (Johnson), David M. Kennedy and Ceorge P. Schultz (Nixon), WilliamEdward Simon (Nixon/Ford), W. Michael Blumenthal (Carter), C. William Miller(Carter), James A. Baker III (Reagan), Nicholas F. Brady (Reagan/Bush), Lloyd M.Bentsen (Clinton), Robert E. Rubin (Clinton), Paul H. O’Neill (C.W. Bush), JohnW. Snow (C.W. Bush), Henry Paulson (C.W. Bush).The Secretary of the Treasury relies heavily on the classified information hereceives from the National Security Council. This classified information permitsthe Department of the Treasury to contribute hilly to the “attainment ofnational security objectives and to the particular climate of opinion the UnitedStates is seeking to achieve in the world,” explains Dr. Richard J. Boylan,behavioral scientist, university associate professor (emeritus) and researcherin the summer 2001 issue of True Democracy.As the late Cary Allen noted in his international best-seller. The RockefellerFile: “The Rockefellers have made the Treasury Department virtually a branch ofthe Chase Manhattan Bank.”Appointments to the Supreme CourtWhen a Justice retires from the Supreme Court, the general public sees thesitting President nominate a replacement who closely reflects his own thinking,including political and religious beliefs. His nominee is then usually approvedby the U.S. Senate. What the general public does not see is how the Presidentshort-lists his candidates. If the President is a CFR member, the possibilitiesare screened by 100 or more Council members working together as the “SpecialCroup” or the “Secret Team”The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupbehind closed doors. Each one is vetted to see which choice will best promotedecisions that advance the opinion that Council on Foreign Relations members areseeking to promote in the world.If the President is not a CFR member, the odd status of George W. Bush, thisselected nominee is still influenced by advisers who are CFR members. Thisensures continuity in the Supreme Court through various presidential terms; forinstance, the Roe v. Wade watershed case, which established women’s right toabortion, was decided by nine Justices chosen by Presidents who belonged to theCFR: Burger (Nixon 1969), Douglas (Roosevelt 1939), Brennan (Eisenhower 1956),Stewart (Eisenhower 1958), White (Kennedy 1962), Marshall (Johnson 1967),Blackmun (Nixon 1970), Powell (Nixon 1971), Rehnquist (Nixon 1971).\"^ In thiscase, many people would agree the decision reached was the right one. But, thedecision may also open the door for selective breeding in the future.It is most distressing to learn that the President does not actually decide onthe choice, but is told whom to select for the vacant seat. This not onlycompromises the American justice system as we believe it should be; it alsosuggests that the final custodians of our individual rights are, in fact,looking after the interests of the CFR.Chapter FourteenCFR AND PSYCHOPOLITICAL OPERATIONSA ccording to Department of the Army Pamphlet No. 525-7-1, The Art and Scienceof Psychological Operations, “the Secretary of Defense is the principalassistant to the president in all matters relating to Department of Defense, andexercises direction, authority, and control over the department. He serves as amember of the National Security Council. Among the several principal militaryand civilian advisor and staff assistants to the secretary, his assistantsecretary for International Security Affairs has major Psychological Operations(PSYOP) related responsibilities.”'*^Hadley Cantril, a successful 1940s sociologist and public opinion researcherexplained this in his 1967 book. The Human Dimension: Experiences in PolicyResearch, published by Rutgers University Press: “Psycho-political operationsare propaganda campaigns designed to create perpetual tensions and to manipulatedifferent groups of people to accept the particular climate of opinion the CFRseeks to achieve in the world.”As Ken Adachi has noted, “What most Americans believe to be ‘Public Opinion’ isin reality carefully crafted and scripted propaganda designed to elicit adesired behavioral response from the public.”**^ Getting people to behave theway you hope they will behave by persuading them that it is ultimately in theirinterest to do so is achieving a desired behavioral response. Public opinionpolls are qualitative studies that investigate in depth the motivations, thefeelings.The True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupand the reactions of selected social groups towards acceptance of the CFR’splanned programs. Implementation of the insidious propaganda and public opinionmanipulations (including mind-control agendas) is executed in the United Statesby well over 200 “think tanks” such as the RAND Corporation, Planning ResearchCorporation, Hudson Institute, International Institute for Applied BehavioralSciences, Heritage Foundation and the Brookings Institution, which are overseenand directed in the United States, by the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) inMenlo Park, California.'^'^As John Coleman in Conspirators’ Hierarchy writes, “Today, the TavistockInstitute operates a $6 billion a year network of Foundations in the U.S., allof it funded by U.S. taxpayers’ money. Ten major institutions are under itsdirect control, with 400 subsidiaries, and 3000 other study groups and thinktanks that originate many types of programs to increase control over theAmerican people. The Stanford Research Institute, adjoining the HooverInstitute, is a $I50-million-a-year operation with 3,300 employees. It carrieson program surveillance for Bechtel, Kaiser, and 400 other companies, andextensive intelligence operations for the CIA. It is the largest institution onthe West Coast promoting mind control and the behavioural sciences.”The Rockefeller-funded RAND Institute and the Rockefeller-financed TavistockInstitute in England investigate the “dynamics of evolution”; that is the logicbehind why people of various backgrounds, interests, loyalties, and informationlevels hold certain opinions. The Establishment elitists refer to it as “theengineering of consent.” As Coleman makes absolutely clear in his book:“Tavistock and like-minded American foundations have a single goal in mind — tobreak down the psychological strength of the individual and render him helplessto oppose the dictators of the World Order.”In Educating for the New World Order (Halcyon House, 1991), B.K. Eakman, notedthe impact of one Establishment think tank: “Specific RAND policies that becameoperative include U.S. nuclear policies, corporate analyses, hundreds ofprojects for the military, the Central Intelligence Agency in relation to theuse of mind altering drugs like peyote, LSD.” One such project was code-namedMK-ULTRA.The covert MK-ULTRA operation, which lasted for 20 years, was the brainchild ofRichard Helms, later to become CIA director. ULTRA was the code name for a CIAmind-control research programCFR AND Psycho-Political Operationslasting from the 1950s through the 1970s. The “doctors,” headed by psychiatristDr. Ewen Cameron and former Nazi scientists, used some of the same techniques asconcentration camps, including electroshock, sleep deprivation, memoryimplantation, memory erasure, sensory modification, and psychoactive drugexperiments. Ironically, Dr. Cameron had served as a member of the Nurembergtribunal that heard the war-crime cases against Nazi doctors.“The ideology of American foundations,” writes Dr. Byron T. Weeks, retiredColonel of the U.S. Air Force, “was created by the Tavistock Institute of HumanRelations in London. In 1921, the Duke of Bedford, Marquess of Tavistock gave abuilding to the Institute to study the effect of shellshock on British soldierswho survived World War I. Its purpose was to establish the breaking point of menunder stress, under the direction of the British Army Bureau of PsychologicalWarfare, commanded by Sir John Rawlings-Reese.”''^The February 1971 edition of a Moscow-based Russian magazine. InternationalAtiairs, carried an article titled, “Ways and Means of U.S. IdeologicalExpansion.” It analyzed America’s propaganda efforts; “Psycho-politicaloperations are further subdivided into strategic psychopolitical operations thatfocus propaganda at small groups of people, such as the academics or experts,capable of influencing public opinion and tactical psycho-political operationsthat focus propaganda at the masses through mass communication media (i.e.newspapers, radio, television, textbooks, educational material, art,entertainment, etc.).”'^^“Our” side evidently saw themselves the same way: “Both forms of propaganda areused to manipulate public opinion to attain foreign policy goals in a givenperiod.” So said a group of experts in a pamphlet entitled The Art and Scienceol Psychological Operations: Case Studies of Military Application Volume One,published in 1976 by the Headquarters Department of the U.S. Army.'^^That same year, Thomas R Dye, one of the most prolific American authors on theinner-workings of modern day America, described the process by which “publicopinion” is established: “This opinion is formulated by the dominant Council onForeign Relations members who belong to an inner circle called the ‘SpecialGroup’ that plan and coordinate the psycho-political operations used tomanipulate the American public, and through a vast intergovernmental undercoverinfrastructure called the ‘Secret Team’ that include the legislative.The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupexecutive, and judicial branches of government, such as the Secretary of State,the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of theCIA; those who control television, radio, and newspaper corporations; who headthe largest law firms; who run the largest and most prestigious universities andthink tanks; who direct the largest pi^te foundations and who direct the largestpublic corporations.”*^^ / The Council on Foreign Relations’ “Secret Team”follows the pattern of leadership of all secret societies. The organization isstructured as circles within circles, with the exterior layer (Secret Team)always protecting the more dominant inner membership (Special Group) thatcoordinates the psycho-political operations. By keeping the objectives, theidentities and the roles played by members of a “Secret Team” hidden from otherteam members, the CFR “Special Group” protects itself from hypotheticalprosecution by denying its participation in the operation. To further protectitself from possible prosecution, the CFR does not reveal to every Councilmember what psycho-political operations are being planned or what their exactrole in the operation is. The more exclusive Bilderberg Group operates underidentical criteria.The CFR has long been convinced that “absolute behavior control is imminent...without mankind’s self-conscious realization that a crisis is at hand.”*^^The Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development of the liberalNational Education Association, points to the effectiveness of today’ssophisticated version of the old Hegelian dialectic process — the heart of theSoviet brainwashing system.There are three ground rules:1) The carefully crafted deception must contain a glimmer of the truth;2) It must be convoluted enough, rendering simple fact-finding impossible. Thiscan be accomplished by withholding key information from the public. According toDale Keiger, a senior writer at Johns Hopkins Magazine covering humanities,international affairs and public policy issues in A Different Form ofCapitalism, “The side meant to lose withholds key information that would causepublic opinion to go against Council plans. In the Marshall Planpsycho-political operation, Kennan was for the plan and Lippmann against it.Kennan’s side won. Years latter in his memoirs Kennan would say that uponreflection Lippmann was right.”CFR AND Psycho-Political Operations3) The use of deception should not discredit a source which may have valuablefuture potential. This means that the media, largely owned by CFR-controlledcorporations, must play the credibility card. With help from the media, forexample, the CFR has already persuaded people around the world that “theresurgence of nationalism, the growth of fundamentalisms and of religiousintolerance” is a global threat.The Council on Foreign Relations creates and delivers psycho-politicaloperations by manipulating people’s reality through a “tactic of deception,”placing Council members on both sides of an issue. The deception is completewhen the public is led to believe that its own best interests are being servedwhile the CFR policy is being carried out.Since the CFR has major leverage within the legal, legislative and courtsystems, it has little to fear from any “official” inquiry. Thus, it is free tocreate the perception in the general public, unable to comprehend the extent ofthe deceit, that laws are being followed. Lawyers, Legislators, and Judgeselected, supported and protected by the Council are committing blatantillegalities to further CFR aims or to hide improprieties which, if exposed,would cause great public outcry.For example, according to the Executive Summary of the Iran-Contra Investigationof the United States Government, available from U.S. National Archives ikRecords Administration for the years 1986-1993:In October and November 1986, two secret U.S. Government operations werepublicly exposed implicating Reagan Administration officials in illegalactivities: the provision of assistance to the military activities of NicaraguanContra rebels during an October1984 to October 1986 prohibition on such aid, and the sale of U.S. arms to Iranin contravention of stated U.S. policy and in possible violation of arms-exportcontrols. These operations became known as the Iran-Contra Affair. The Iranoperation involved efforts in1985 and 1986 to obtain the release of Americans held hostage in the Middle Eastthrough the sale of U.S. weapons to Iran, despite an embargo on such sales. TheContra operations from 1984 through most of 1986 involved the secretgovernmental support of Contra military and paramilitary activities inNicaragua, despite Congressional prohibition of this support.The Iran and Contra operations were merged when funds generated from the sale ofweapons to Iran were diverted to support the Contra effort in Nicaragua.Although this “diversion”The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupmay be the most dramatic aspect of Iran/Contra, it is important to emphasizethat both the Iran and Contra operations, separately, violated United Statespolicy and law that is Arms Export Control Act. In late November 1986, Reaganadministration officials announced that some of the proceeds from the sale ofU.S. arms to Iran had been diverted to the Contras.On November 26, 1986, the Attorney General ordered the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation to begin an investigation of the Iran/Contra episode. On December19, 1986, Lawrence Walsh was appointed Independent Counsel to proceed with theinvestigation. Did Lawrence Walsh play a constitutionally defined role as anIndependent Council, or might he, too, have been part of a much greaterconspiracy?The record shows Walsh to have joined Henry Kissinger’s team in Paris duringViet Nam talks in 1969. In 1981, Walsh worked for one of the oldest law firms inOklahoma, Crowe and Dunlevy founded in 1902; the firm represented oil andinsurance companies run by CFR members.CFR members of the “Special Group” — George H.W. Bush (Vice President), DonaldT. Regan (Chief of Staff to the President), Elliot Abrams (Assistant Secretaryof State for International Organization Affairs), John Poindexter (U.S. NationalSecurity Advisor), Casper Weinberger (Secretary of Defense), Robert M. Gates(Deputy Director CIA), William J. Casey (CIA Director), and Robert C. McFarlane(Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs) — all had advisedReagan to go ahead with Iran-Contra.On December 24, 1992, reports Associated Press, six years after the Iran-Contraaffair broke. President George H.W. Bush took advantage of Christmas and thesubsequent lack of attention from the media to pardon fellow CFR membersWeinberger, McFarlane, Abrams, and three CIA chiefs named Fiers, George, andClarridge. Why didn’t the “free press” bring this travesty of justice into theliving rooms of America? By remaining silent (another tactic of deception), thepress further demonstrated that it is part of the operation, part of the system,part of the shadow government.After a seven-year investigation that cost American taxpayers millions ofdollars, only one person, a second tier no-name, was convicted and sent toprison... for not paying his income taxes.CFR AND Psycho-Political OperationsAn additional “tactic of deception” used to achieve the aims of the Council onForeign Relations is to finance and “oversee” a legitimate study by a respectedorganization, with the express aim of manipulating public opinion by clever useof the right language.Kai Bird, contributing editor and foreign affairs columnist for The Nationmagazine, explained how this is accomplished in The Color of Truth: McGeorgeBundy and William Bundy: Brothers in Arms: “William L Langer... organized theCIA’s Office of National Estimates (known as ONE in 1950).... Langer had gone toWashington at the call of the CIA and promptly hired McGeorge’s brother Bill asone of his top aides. They were old friends and political allies.... McGeorgehad published a review in The Reporter of a massive two volume study ofAmerica’s entry into World War II written by Langer and S. Everett Gleason.Langer had finished the project while at the CIA and Gleason was a high-rankingofficial in the National Security Council. McGeorge Bundy called it a‘magnificent achievement... so thorough that it will never be done again....’Funded by the Rockefeller Foundation and the Council on Foreign Relations to thetune of $139,000 — an extraordinary sum in those years — and written withprivileged access to classified documents, the Langer-Gleason volumes wereofficial history parading as independent scholarship.”William (Bill) Bundy, the man hired by Langer, was responsible for drafting theTonkin Gulf Resolution. Lie was also an editor of the CFR’s Foreign Affairsmagazine. Furthermore, Bill Bundy was CFR Dean Acheson’s son-in-law. Acheson’slaw partner was Donald Fliss — brother of the Soviet spy Alger Hiss. In the late1940s, the Polish Communist Party hired Acheson’s law firm to help win U.S.recognition. Also it was Acheson, the former Secretary of State, along with theaforementioned Walt Rostow, who persuaded Johnson to escalate the Viet Nam War.The Council on Foreign Relations uses tax-free foundations as principal conduitsto funnel money into favorable policy-making processes. Thomas R Dye stated thatnearly 40% of all foundation assets were controlled by the top ten or elevenfoundations, who in turn were controlled by the Council on Foreign Relations.^*Furthermore, “The directors or trustees have great latitude in directing the useof foundation monies to underwrite research, investigate social problems, createor assist universities, establish ‘think tanks,’ endow museums, etc.”*’^The True Story of the Bii.derberg GroupIn 1993, Rene Wormser found that “the RAND National Defense Research Instituteis a federally-funded Council on Foreign Relations ‘think-tank’ sponsored by theOffice of the Secretary of Defense and headed by Council on Foreign Relationsmember Michael D. Rich. Clients include the Pentagon, AT&T, Chase ManhattanBank, IBM, Republican Party, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Department of Energy and NASA.The interlocking leadership between the trustees at RAND, and the Ford,Rockefeller, and Carnegie foundations is a classic case of CFR/Bilderberg modusoperandi. The Ford Foundation gave one million dollars to Rand in 1952, at atime when the president of the Ford Foundation was simultaneously the chairmanof RAND.”^^Two thirds of RAND’s research involves national security issues and consequentlyis labeled secret. The other third of Rand Corporation research is devoted topopulation control studies (applied demography). One of the key areas of RAND’sexpertise deals with studies on how to misinform and to manipulate large groupsof people. This often employs yet another tactic of deception: the Orwellian useof double talk. That is to say, peace is called war, pacifists are calledterrorists, and those who try to tell the truth are denigrated for spreadinghate and spewing evil.In July 1992, influenced by the uncertainty of the dissolution of the SovietUnion and alarmed at the impending changes in Eastern Europe, RAND broughttogether the leading world experts to discuss the problems in the new worldenvironment. The resulting document was “revised,” that is molded to theobjectives of RAND, and published as a Summer Institute Report titled,“Peacekeeping and Peacemaking after the Cold War.” According to the report, theSecretary-General of the UN “defines peace building as post conflict action...The Secretary-General has linked preventive diplomacy with preventivedeployments of military forces.”RAND stresses that, “the Secretary-General in his Agenda for Peace... emphasizesthe need for governments to share information on political or militarysituations, and in so doing, he is asking for an expansion of Intelligencesharing...” Again, I emphasize that RAND’s expertise in misinforming andmanipulating large groups of people is one of the key attributes of thisRockefeller/CFR-funded corporation.Chapter FifteenCFR AND THE MARSHALLPLANT he Marshall Plan is so-named for the speech on June 5, 1947, by formerGeneral, and then-U.S. Secretary of State, George Marshall, at HarvardUniversity. Marshall proposed a solution to the disintegrating economic andsocial conditions that faced Europeans in the aftermath of World War II. Underthe program, the United States would provide aid to prevent starvation in themajor war areas, repair the devastation of those areas as quickly as possible,and invite European countries to join in a cooperative plan for economicreconstruction. According to a brochure available from the Library of Congressof the United States, “America also benefited from the plan by developingvaluable trading partners and reliable allies among the West European nations.Even more important were the many ties of individual and collective friendshipthat developed between the United States and Europe.”What is less generally acknowledged is that the “Plan” came with stringsattached. America made explicit requirements for trade liberalization andincreases in productivity, thus “ensuring the Americanization of Europe asEuropean political and economic elites became wedded to their Americancounterparts with no significant economic or political development taking placewithout U.S. approval,” according to English political writer Richard Greaves inhis essay, “Who really runs the world?”The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupThe Foreign Assistance Act that emerged in 1948 set up the Economic CooperationAgency (EGA) to administer the European Recovery Program (ERP). Between theyears 1948-1951, when the Marshall Plan was Formally in operation, Congressappropriated $13.3 billion in aid to sixteen western European states.In an article called “The Bilderberg Group and the project of EuropeanUnification” in Lobster magazine, political commentator Mike Peters writes,“This unprecedented exercise of international generosity (dubbed by Churchillthe ‘most sordid act in history’) served direct economic purposes for theinternationally oriented U.S. corporations which promoted it. William Clayton[CFR], for example, the Under-Secretary for Economic Affairs, whose tour ofEurope and letters sent back to Washington played a key role in preparing theplan, and who pushed it through Congress, personally profited to the tune of$700,000 a year; and his own company, Anderson, Clayton & Co. secured $10million of Marshall Plan orders up to the summer of 1949. General Motorssimilarly got $5.5 million worth of orders between July 1950 and 1951 (14.7% ofthe total), and the Ford Motor Company got $1 million (4.2% of the total).”Kai Bird described the hidden aspects of the Plan in her book on the Bundybrothers. In 1949, “McGeorge Bundy, former Ford Foundation President, took on aproject with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York to study Marshall Planaid to Europe.... The Council’s study group on aid to Europe included some ofthe foreign policy establishment’s leading figures. Working with young Bundy onthe project were Allen Dulles, David Lilienthal, Dwight Eisenhower, WillClayton, George Kennan, Richard M. Bissell and Franklin A. Lindsay. Dulles,Bissell and Lindsay... would shortly become high-ranking officials of the newlyformed Central Intelligence Agency... Their meetings were considered sosensitive that the usual off-the-record transcript was not distributed toCouncil members. There was good reason for the secrecy. These were probably theonly private citizens privy to the highly classified fact that there was acovert side to the Marshall Plan. Specifically, the CIA was tapping into the$200 million a year in local currency counterpart Rinds contributed by therecipients of Marshall Plan aid. These unvouchered monies were being used by theCIA to finance anti-Communist electoral activities in France and Italy and tosupport sympathetic journalists, labor union leaders and politicians.”CFR AND THE Marshall Pu\\nOrigins of the Marshall PlanT he origins of the Marshall Plan are, in fact, to be found in thepolicy-formation networks instituted by the Council on Foreign Relations in 1939prior to World War II. Michio Kaku and Daniel Axelrod in To Win the Nuclear War:The Pentagon’s Secret War Plans, explain that “the minutes of the closetmeetings that were held between the State Department and the CFR beginning in1939 explicitly detail the role of the U.S. as an encroaching force and areplacement for the British Empire.Mike Peters agreed: “The plan which Marshall presented in his speech at Flarvardhad previously been outlined in the proposals of a CFR study group of 1946headed by the lawyer Charles M. Spoffbrd and David Rockefeller, entitledReconstruction in Western EuropeP^According to G. William Domhoff in The Powers that Be, published by VintageBooks in 1978, another effort was made through the Committee for the MarshallPlan formed in 1947 “to combat right wing American isolationists. Chairing thecommittee was Flenry L. Stimson, a former Secretary of War and Secretary ofState, who had been a CFR member since the 1920s.” He noted that five of theseven-member Committee were affiliated with the CFRThe movement to form a united Europe was part of a larger plan to form a worldgovernment. Carroll Quigley, a professor of History at the Foreign ServiceSchool of Georgetown University, traced the evolution of the Establishment, akafuture New World Order, in the 20^'' Century in Tragedy and Hope, noting that“the integration of Western Europe begun in 1948 was motivated by the MarshallPlan.... The United States had offered Marshall Plan aid with the provision thatthe European recovery be constructed on a cooperative basis. This led to theConvention for European Economic Cooperation... signed in April 1948 and theHague Congress for European Union held the following month.”The Hague Congress called for a United Europe and issued seven resolutions onaspects of political union. Number seven stated, “The creation of a UnitedEurope must be regarded as an essential step towards the creation of a UnitedWorld,” according to Dennis Behreandt in an article in The New Americanmagazine.Behreandt further explains that “the Marshall Plan, aside from helping to putEurope back on its feet, led to the Schuman Plan inThe True Story of the Bilderberg Group1950, when the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman proposed that the entirecoal and steel production of both France and Germany be placed under theauthority of one supranational body,” which in turn led to the Coal and IronCommunity, then to Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community), andultimately to the Common Market.Professor Quigley noted that the Coal and Steel Community “was a trulyrevolutionary organization since it had sovereign powers, including theauthority to raise funds outside any existing state’s power ... control prices,channel investment,... allocate coal and steel during shortages, and fixproduction in times of surplus.”In short, “the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was a rudimentarygovernment.” Coming into force during 1952, the arrangement pooled the coal andsteel resources of six nations (France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourgand the Netherlands) under a single authority, lifting restrictions on importsand exports, creating a unified labor market, adopting a joint economic policyand harmonizing the standard of living in the member states to help preventanother war.Hidden by General Marshall and the CFR crowd was the fact that the ECSC was thefirst concrete step toward political unification, the first block of the Empirebuilding, the Empire being the One World Government. With the signing of theTreaty of Rome, paving the way for the European Economic Community in 1957, thenext step towards a future world government was taken. The Treaty of Rome cameinto effect on January 1, 1958.Chapter SixteenVISIBLE PATTERNSE urope has been forced into a union of states. Not as Napoleon dreamed it wouldbe, under the French flag, and not as Hitler planned to subjugate it under theSwastika. But, by a stroke of irony, as both Napoleon and Hitler sought to unifyEurope under the Eagle standard, so does the Eagle emblem represent the UnitedStates, and high-powered Americans have worked in secret and in public todismantle independent sovereignties to create today’s European Union.Ambrose Evans-Pritchard tracks this American push to European unification in anarticle in The Telegraph of London from September of 2000: “The U.S.Intelligence community ran a campaign in the Fifties and Sixties to buildmomentum for a united Europe. It funded and directed the European federalistmovement.”During the period mentioned, the CIA was directed by influential members of theCouncil on Foreign Relations: Allen Dulles, General Walter Bedell Smith andWilliam Donovan, the former head of the OSS, precursor to the CIA. Donovan ledthe American Committee for a United Europe, which ran and supported the Europeanfederalist movement, as noted in Evans-Pritchard’s article.The dots leading to the unification of European nations travel from the MarshallPlan, to the European Coal and Steel Community, to the European EconomicCommunity, and it’s not far-reaching to say that America’s Council on ForeignRelations paved the path for the present European government. CFR members havebeen Involved in every step of the journey.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupThe State Department Publication 1111 ^ CFR Special Groups/ Secret Teams, andits War and Peace Studies have all had a tremendous impact on world geopolitics.Yet, these events and behind-the-scenes maneuverings are still not reported. Whyis the role of the Council on Foreign Relations in sponsoring and carrying outthese actions and operations ignored in modern history texts? Wliy aren’t thereany universities — the hub of American liberalism — offering courses on one ofAmerica’s most influential and oldest private organizations, one molding UnitedStates foreign policy to its private agenda? Why haven’t Pulitzer Prize-winninginvestigative reporters, university professors, historians, authors, statesmen,politicians, and researchers noticed the evolution toward a one-worldgovernment?Socrates, at least, would have been appalled. The human being investigates andthereby learns. Any topic is grist for a thinker. Is the public’s lack ofintellectual curiosity a symptom of the mental pacification to come?I acknowledge that it is difficult for people to believe that the CFR is asecret organization with ulterior motives, when the Council offers a copy of itsannual report containing a list of all members plus invites the public tosubscribe to the Council’s publication. Foreign Affairs, as well as browsethrough its Web site. There, it is explained that the CFR’s InternationalAdvisory Board consists of 40-odd members chosen from Europe, North and SouthAmerica, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, and that they “are invited tocomment on institutional programs and strategic directions, and on practicalopportunities for collaboration between the Council and institutions abroad.”Unlike the Bilderberg Group, the CFR even has a secretary, who politely answersmost of your questions. However, this is all a ruse. Their true intentions canbe found within the pages of the very annual reports they so politely hand outto the public each year. When you examine the CFR’s life-member list, forinstance, you will find that 90% either sit on the Trilateral Commission orbelong to the Bilderberg Group, and sharper scrutiny, of the CFR’s 1992 AnnualReport for example, reveals the Council emphatically warning in many places andin varying terms that members better not tell outsiders “who said what.”^^If this is not a secret organization, then why would the CFR insist on members’utter discretion? At this point, it is important to remember what Title-50,Section 783, of the United States Code, “War andVisible PatternsNational Defense of the United States,” declares; “It shall be unlawhil for anyofficer or employee of the United States or of any department or agency thereof,or of any corporation the stock of which is owned in whole or in major part bythe United States or any department or agency thereof, to communicate in anymanner or by any means, to any other person whom such officer or employee knowsor has reason to believe to be an agent or representative of any foreigngovernment, any information of a kind which shall have been classified by thePresident (or by the head of any such department, agency, or corporation withthe approval of the President) as affecting the security of the United States,knowing or having reason to know that such information has been so classified,unless such officer or employee shall have been specifically authorized by thePresident, or by the head of the department, agency, or corporation by whichthis officer or employee is employed, to make such disclosure of suchinformation.”In other words, any group or individual who knowingly works against the UnitedStates to benefit a foreign power’s takeover of the country commits an act oftreason.picture49 [images/picture49.jpg]Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney^with George H.W.

Oppressive heat andhumidity hung everywhere as I walked the local streets, looking to quench mythirst. Some three hundred meters from the famous Trianon Palace Hotel, ahorseshoe dangling over the doorway of a rundown tavern caught my eye. Its wornpurple and green exterior needed a good paint job, and the contrast between theluxurious hotel and this pub’s plainness struck my sense of irony: were wedestined to return to a world with only two classes — rich and poor, rulers andworkers — in a system reminiscent of feudal lords and serfs, and under onegovernment dominating the world? It was a plan few cared to know about, andtonight I was tired of searching for evidence that would expose this threat toour freedom. I had arranged no interviews. I just wanted the comfort of humdrumactivity and the din of disconnected voices. Appetizing smells from within thepub perked my craving for a cafe cream, and I crossed the doorstep.Inside, only standing room was left at the bar. I found a spot, leaned againstthe counter top and gave the bartender my order. In front of me, myriad liquorbottles, cups and glasses lined the wall racks. A coffee machine sat on thecounter. Behind me and to my right, Welsh tourists and a bearded hunchbackwearing leather gloves and a traveling cap occupied a group of tables gatheredtogether. While I wondered why he was wearing gloves on such a sultry night, afat lady with an oversized mole on her chin explained to the tourists that hewas a pianist and had to protect his hands.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupTo my left at another table, a boisterous bunch played cards. One myopic mandrew my attention. I imagined he had just stepped out of a van Gogh painting.Elderly, bald and flabby, he wore an oversized gray suit that, rather thanstreamlining his body, made him look dumpier. Enormous horn-rimmed glassesamplified his pink watery eyes ogling the people about him. The permanent shadowof a thick beard spread across his jaw and chin, and above his mouth perched agray-streaked moustache, carelessly clipped. He ordered rum, filled his pipe,and gazed at the game absent-mindedly.It was long past the Parisians’ dinner hour of eight o’clock, and I could hear apiano playing in the drawing room, loud banter and laughter to the exclamationsof delighted children. As I paid for my favorite coffee, my perception of thepub changed. Maybe it was so popular that the proprietor didn’t have time togive the place a facelift. The thought encouraged me.“I would like to speak to you.” I could feel the man’s breath stir the hairs onthe back of my neck. I instinctively turned to my right. No one was there.“Stay seated, please,” wheezed a second voice.My nerve ends bristled. How often was I to be harassed by the CIA, or theMossad, threatened by local police, photographed by security forces? Was thisanother shakedown? I swiveled around on my bar stool to confront the voices.“Slumming, are we fellas?”A British-looking gentleman ignored my barb. “Mr. Estulin, we are sorry tointrude into your space, but we would very much like to speak to you.” Heextended a flaccid hand in the hope I might choose to shake it. “Needless tosay, we ask your maximum discretion.”I could tell from his clumsy syntax that he had acquired his pseudo-culturedEnglish accent from fake literjti, who specialized in teaching posh Britishlanguage and manners.“How do you know my name? I don’t remember offering it to you.”“We know quite a bit about you, Mr. Estulin,” claimed the rasping voice of ayellow-haired, broad-shouldered man. He stood behind, in the first man’s shadow.No doubt his bodyguard. I dubbed them “Tweedle Dee” and “Tweedle Dum.”“Indeed,” I said leaning back on my bar stool, letting silence spread betweenus. Silence was as much my friend as their weapon.Confrontation, 2003The fake Tweedle Dee lowered his gaze, fished out a cigarette case from thebreast pocket of his well-cut jacket, and began to examine it. “For example, weknow you are here to cover the Bilderberg conference. You have been following usfor many years. Somehow, you seem to know the exact location of every meeting,even though most of the attendees do not find out where it will be held until aweek prior to the conference. I regret to admit, as much as we have tried tocover our tracks and take all necessary precautions, you seem to know what wediscuss and most of our future plans.”Tweedle Dee lifted his gaze and locked on my eyes. “Your meddling, Mr. Estulin,has even influenced our choice of some of the attendees. At one point, wethought we found you out. We believed a certain member not attending to theconference was your inside contact. Had you been wrong in your conferencepredictions, the unsuspecting member could have suffered great personalconsequences. Fortunately, for him, you were spot on.”Wliile I listened, my mind finally tagged the accent he was trying to imitate:Kent.“How do you know all this stuff?” asked Tweedle Dum.I looked the man over and resisted an urge to smile. Finally, “they” —representatives of this highly secret group of international power brokers andfinanciers who formed the Bilderberg Group — were reaching out directly to me.It was a compliment, if a dangerous one. I needed to keep my wits.“Let’s say it’s a professional secret,” I said, silently thanking my lucky starsthat 1 had not used this pub for meeting with my contacts at the Trianon Palace.Tweedle Dee’s intervention clearly meant that anyone working at the hotel seentalking to me would likely be fired.Tweedle Dum’s straw-cropped moustache and bulbous nose twitched at my tersereply. He had huge arching eyebrows and a diminutive mouth that sliced into acold triangular smile meant to intimidate me.Tweedle Dee inserted his right hand into his left trouser pocket, letting thedivergent coat flaps reveal the watch chain across his waistcoat, and said, “Youare quite an enigma, sir.” Giving Tweedle Dum a noticeable glance toward theexit, he made a suggestion in a quiet, yet firm tone: “Please follow us outsidewhere we can talk more freely.”Curious, I agreed.The True Story of the Bii.derberg GroupBy now, a huge moon burned through the distant trees edging the hotel terrace.Ahead, streetlights blinked. I could make out faint babble coming from outdoorcafes along the way as well as barking dogs. The three of us remained silent forseveral minutes.“Why do you follow us around?” asked Tweedle Dee. “You don’t work for anynewspaper of renown. You write articles that make our members uncomfortable.Several congressmen in America and members of Parliament in Canada were forcedto cancel their presence at our annual meeting when you named them as invitedguests.”“Not good,” intoned Tweedle Dum.Tweedle Dee continued: “The Bilderberg Group, Mr. Estulin, is a private forumwhere off-the-record friendly discussion takes place among influential membersof the business community. Politicians are invited to share their personal andprofessional experiences with the group. All this is done with the hope thatthese types of forums can bridge the gap between the high-stakes politics andthe greater needs of the world’s peoples. In no way, do we try to influencegovernments’ policy or decision making.”“Bullshit!” I snapped. I could feel my neck muscles bulge. My indignationvented. “Had it not been for the efforts of persistent journalists, Canada bynow would have become part of the Greater United States. And why did you peoplekill Aldo Moro?”“You know we can’t tell you anything, Mr. Estulin. I did not come to argue withyou, sir.” Tweedle Dee considered me. “Would it be too much to ask of you if wespoke off the record?”“I don’t usually speak off the record, especially where the Bilderberg Group isconcerned.”I realized that I was acting foolishly, but for the moment, I was enjoying theopportunity to give the “face” of my underhanded nemesis a sense of mysuppressed frustration with their covert agendas. Maybe, if 1 could forceTweedle Dee into losing his temper, I rationalized, I might find out what thismeeting was really about. Instead, he rattled on for a few more minutes aboutthe virtues of partnerships, collaboration among nations, starving children inAfrica... the usual propaganda. I tried to concentrate on listening but sooncaught myself watching Tweedle Dum’s face. He either smiled vacantly or lickedhis moustache.Confrontation, 2003“We can really make it worth your while, Mr. Estulin.” My attention snapped backto Tweedle Dee. “What conditions would you wish to impose?” he asked.I glanced again at the silent Tweedle Dum, to gauge his interest in my answer.He stood stone-faced. Tweedle Dee fiddle-fingered his cigarette, gently strokedit, bit his lower lip and pondered. His eyes did not really look at thecigarette, but into the distance as he waited for me to respond.“As a condition for my silence, I would like all future Bilderberg meetings tobe announced publicly. I want free and unimpeded access granted to anyjournalist who wishes to attend. All conferences are to be on-the-record, thelist of attendees to be released to the public in advance of the event. No CIA,guns, dogs, private security and most of all no secrecy!”“You know we can’t do that, Mr. Estulin. The stakes are too high, and it is verylate in the game.”“Then, sir,” I replied, “you will just have to put up with me until the refereeblows the final whistle.”Tweedle Dee nodded in his decorous manner. “Then it’s a good evening, Mr.Estulin. I’m sorry to have wasted your time.”Tweedle Dum donned his hat and walked away in step with his boss.Only then, did I again realize how much was at stake. This was no mereconversation between the Bilderberger’s emissaries and me. It was a warning.picture57 [images/picture57.jpg]dpicture58 [images/picture58.jpg]picture59 [images/picture59.jpg]Chapter EighteenBACK TO THE FUTUREW ithout a doubt, the Bilderberg Group is the premier occult forum operating inthe shadows of power, but a little understood entity — the Trilateral Commission(TC) — also plays a vital role in the New World Order’s scheme to use wealth,concentrated in the hands of the few, to exert world control. The powerfulindividuals who belong to the Trilateral Commission all share the sameanti-nationalist philosophy, and try to prevent the national forces within theirrespective countries from exerting influence on policy.The Trilateral Commission was established in 1973. Its founder and primary moverwas international financier David Rockefeller, longtime chairman of theRockefeller family-controlled Chase Manhattan Bank. Journalist Bill Moyers spokeabout the power of David Rockefeller in a TV documentary. The Secret Governmentin 1980: “David Rockefeller is the most conspicuous representative today of theruling class, a multinational fraternity of men who shape the global economy andmanage the flow of its capital ... Private citizen David Rockefeller is accordedprivileges of a head of state ... He is untouched by customs or passport officesand hardly pauses for traffic lights.”The first meeting of the Trilateral Commission was held in Tokyo between October21 and 23, 1973. Sixty-hve persons represented the North American group. Ofthose, 35 were also affiliated with the Council on Foreign Relations.The Trilateral Commission is divided into three regions — American, European andPacific Asian. American headquarters are in Washington;The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupEuropean, in Paris; and Asian, in Tokyo. The 2006 annual three-day TrilateralCommission meeting was held in Tokyo, the 2007 was held held in Brussels and the2008, from April 25 to 28 in Washington, D.C. The meetings are closed to thepublic, and the non-aligned media is denied access. Thomas Foley has served asthe North American chairman since May 2001. The European chairman for many yearshas been international businessman and politician Peter Sutherland; the PacificAsian chairman is business executive Yotaro Kobayashi.According to the Trilateral Commission’s Web site, “each regional group has achairman and deputy chairman, who all together constitute the leadership of theCommittee. The Executive Committee draws together a further 36 individuals fromthe wider membership” with proportional representation from the three regions.Committee members meet several times per year to coordinate their work andprepare the agenda.Trilateral membership is chosen by the group’s Executive Committee. At any giventime, it has around 350 members, each serving a three-year term. Even a cursorylook at the membership list establishes beyond doubt that every one of thepeople invited to join were, and are, members of the Establishment, theproverbial insiders, recruited with consummate skill and singleness of purposefrom the political, commercial, banking and media sectors. Commission membersare obliged to resign their membership in the group when they enter governement,but, according to Arlene Johnson, publisher of True Democracy, their loyalty andideology “does not change just because one is elected to a government post. Infact, the loyalty given to the commission for its support in obtaining aprestigious position seems to prompt reciprocal action to perpetuate theeffectiveness of the Commission. Therefore, prior to their elections orappointments, many high officials in government are active Trilateralmembers.”^*Moreover, members usually rejoin once their public commitment is over.Three hand-picked experts representing each area of operations write theTrilateral Commission’s annual Task Force Reports. It can take up to a year toprepare one. In Trilateralism: The Trilateral Commission and Elite Planning forWorld Management, well-known Knight-Ridder columnist and author. Holly Sklar,explains how these Task Force Reports are developed:Back to the FutureThe topics for projects are chosen by the chairmen, deputy chairmen, anddirectors, with the advice of the Executive Committee and others. Authors arethen invited, sometimes from the Commission membership. The authors do notrelocate to the offices of the Commission while preparing their report. Theyremain in their existing institutional settings, and the Commission enables themto meet with each other and various consultants along the way. The reports areto the Trilateral Commission, not o/ the Commission.The membership of the Commission is too diverse to achieve detailed agreementquickly on a controversial set of issues; and on a few occasions a summary ofdiscussion in the annual meeting has been added to a report to detail thecontroversy it created.^^In addition to Task Force Reports, the Trilateral Commission produces a journalcalled Trialogue. “In earlier years, the Trialogue series included specialnumbers on particular issues in addition to the numbers on Trilateral Commissionmeetings.The Commission has regional head offices, a small full-time staff, telephone andfax lines, business cards, and a Web site. Its annual reports are available tothe general public for a small fee, although its inner workings are secret. Itsmembership list is available upon request, but members, as is the case with theBilderbergers and the CFR, are pledged to secrecy regarding its goals andoperations. The Trilateral Commission is certainly no Bilderberger outfit. Butwhat are they, exactly? And how do their policies affect us?Antony Sutton, author of Trilaterals over Washington, writes that “this group ofprivate citizens is precisely organized in a manner that ensures its collectiveviews have significant impact on public policy. They meet, they review, theydiscuss, they report, and, after this discussion, make their recommendationspublic.In its hrst year and a half, the Trilateral Commission released six positionpapers to the public. In the years that followed, producing such papers becamethe TC’s trademark strategy, not only to gauge the mood of the public at largebut also to present the Commission’s agenda. These first six issued by theCommission were titled The Triangle Papers: two followed the Tokyo meeting inOctober 1973, three summarized the result of a meeting in Brussels in June 1974,and one was produced after a Washington, D.C. meeting in December 1974.In The Rockefeller File, Gary Allen made a prediction concerning the TrilateralCommission, “If the Triangle Papers are any indication.TFiE True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupwe can look for four major thrusts toward world economic controls.”The first, he noted, would pursue a renovated world monetary system; the secondwould loot U.S. resources for the further radicalization of “have-not” nations;the third would step-up trade with the Communists, and the fourth would milk theenergy crisis to gain greater international control.In the decades since Allen assessed the Commission’s intentions in its firstposition papers, what has the TC actually accomplished?No. 1: We’ve seen two regional economic blocks emerge — the European Community,and the Union of the Americas with the adoption of the National Free TradeAgreement (NAFTA). The soon-to-be-created Asian monetary union is waiting in thewings.No. 2: The U.S. and western nations have heavily subsidized and carried debt forThird World countries.No. 3: The U.S. sent billions of dollars worth of technology to the Soviets andthe Chinese, and established burgeoning trade following its detente with theChinese and the Russians.No. 4: We’ve seen one energy crisis after another beginning with the 1973 SuezCrisis, more recently the Desert Storm action of the early ’90s to restore worldoil production to Kuwait following Iraq’s invasion to annex the oil fields, andnow the ongoing war in Iraq. U.S. justihcation for invading Iraq was to secureweapons of mass destruction — these threatened world stability — but they nevermaterialized; so obviously, the Americans’ true purpose was to manipulate theflow of Middle East oil, despite promises to free the Iraqi people to buildtheir own democracy.Holly Sklar — the first to recognize the Trilateral Commission’s movement to“globalization” long before the term became a buzzword — maintains that theglobal interdependence between the Big Three economic world powers “allows therich to safeguard the interests of Western capitalism in an explosive world —probablyBack to the Futureby discouraging protectionism, nationalism, or any response that would pit theelites of one against the elites of another. The anticipated economic pressureswill be deflected downward rather than laterally.”^^In Final Warning: A History of the New World Order, David Rivera holds the viewthat the Trilateral Commission’s goal is “to make the world safe forinterdependence by protecting the benefits, which it provides for each countryagainst external and internal threats, which will constantly emerge from thosewilling to pay a price for more national autonomy. This may sometimes requireslowing the pace at which interdependence proceeds, and checking some aspects ofit. More frequently however, it will call for checking the intrusion of nationalgovernment into the international exchange of both economic and non-economicgoods.”In the late 1970s, then-Federal Reserve Chairman, Paul Volcker — aTrilateralist, who once worked for the Rockefeller’s Chase Manhattan Bank —didn’t mince words when he told the American people how these “economicpressures” would affect them. “The standard [of living] of the average Americanhas to decline.”Volcker was a man of his word. Under his “fiscal austerity” program implementedduring President Jimmy Carter’s administration in October 1979, the Treasurybill rate increased an unfathomable six percent during a six month period.Interest rates soared from five percent in 1977 to over 18 percent in 1980, asmeasured by the rate paid by the government on Treasury bills. The increaseadded further momentum to the inflation that sent the ’80s and early ’90s intoan economic slump that was comparable to the Great Depression in the way itrestructured the global economy and eliminated industrial jobs.When David Rockefeller read Between Two Ages: America's Role in the TechnotronicEra, a book published in 1970 by Professor Zbigniew Brzezinski of ColumbiaUniversity, he already shared the view that “people, governments and economiesof all nations must serve the needs of multinational banks and corporations”with Marxist CFR founder Edward Mandell House.In fact, Brzezinski was so bold as to dismiss the U.S. Constitution — the verydocument that limits government abuse of power — as “inadequate.” Instead,Brzezinski claimed that “the old framework of international politics, with theirspheres of influence... the fiction ofThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupsovereignty... is clearly no longer compatible with reality,” and proposed “theapproaching two-hundredth anniversary of the Declaration of Independence couldjustify the call for the national constitutional convention to re-examine thenation’s formal institutional framework... [and] could serve as a suitabletarget date culminating a national dialogue on the relevance of existingarrangements.”That same year, Brzezinski also contributed to Foreign Afhirs, the CFRpublication, asserting that a new and broader approach was needed. He suggestedthe “creation of a community of the developed nations, which can effectivelyaddress itself to the larger concerns confronting mankind.... A councilrepresenting the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, with regular meetingsof the heads of governments as well as some small standing machinery, would be agood start.”These words must have been the call-to-arms that set David Rockefeller inaction, for in the spring of 1972, he broached the idea of a TrilateralCommission at the annual Bilderberger meeting in Knokke, Belgium. According toGeorge S. Franklin, former Trilateral Commission coordinator, the Groupresponded with great enthusiasm for Rockefeller’s proposal of an internationalalliance that would create strategies and policies to consolidate the fourpillars of power — “political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical” —under a central world government. “The next eight speakers said that this was amarvellous idea; by all means, somebody get it launched.Two months after the Bilderberg meeting, in July 1972, David Rockefeller lenthis famous Pocantico Hills estate in New York’s Hudson Valley to be theheadquarters for the first organizational meetings of the Trilateral Commission.Two-hundred-and-fifty financiers and industrialists, with interlockingmemberships in the Bilderberg Group and the CFR, attended that Hrstget-together.With the formation of the Trilateral Commission, did David Rockefeller sow theseeds of a revolution for this century within the political institutions of ourmodern republics? It is certainly the one step that took Brzezinski’s vision offthe page, making a “movement toward a larger community by the developing nations... through a variety of indirect ties and already developing limitations onnational sovereignty” into a living reality.But, even in the very best scenario, there is something very disturbing about apower coalition of this magnitude being put together fromBack to the Futurebehind the scenes. Even the Establishment-owned Washington Post of January 16,1977, found unsettling features about the Trilateral Commission: “Trilateralistsare not three-sided people. They are members of a private, though not secret,international organization put together by the wealthy banker, DavidRockefeller, to stimulate the [EJstablishment dialogue between Western Europe,Japan and the United States. But here is the unsettling thing about theTrilateral Commission. The President-elect [Carter] is a member. So is the VicePresident-elect Walter F. Mondale. So are the new Secretaries of State, Defenseand Treasury: Cyrus R. Vance, Harold Brown and W. Michael Blumenthal. So isZibigniew Brzezinski, who is a former Trilateral director and Carter’s nationalsecurity adviser, also a bunch of others who will make foreign policy forAmerica in the next four years.”The Establishment crowd “got the message.” Soon after, Katherine Graham,Chairperson of the Board of Washington Post Companies, was offered a Trilateralmembership to go along with her memberships in the Bilderberg Group and Councilon Foreign Relations. From then on, that leading newspaper no longer felt itnecessary to shine the light of truth on the newest of “private” organizations.From its inception, the Commission aimed to fashion an enduring partnershipamong the ruling elites of North America, Western Europe, and Japan, and itscoordination among the three spheres of power constitutes the reason for dubbingitself the Trilateral Commission. The TC first needed to educate the public andleaders of most countries to switch from their concept of a world split intoseparate nations to thinking in terms of global perspectives.Long after the Trilateral Commission’s inauguration, its official Web siteclaimed credit for the realization of the global marketplace: “The ‘growinginterdependence’ that so impressed the founders of the Trilateral Commission inthe early 1970s is deepening into ‘globalization.’ The need for shared thinkingand leadership by the Trilateral countries, who (along with the principalinternational organizations) remain the primary anchors of the widerinternational system, has not diminished but, if anything, intensified. At thesame time, their leadership must change to take into account the dramatictransformation of the international system. As relations with other countriesbecome more mature — and power more diffuse — theThe True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupleadership tasks of the original Trilateral countries need to be carried outwith others to an increasing extent.”So what’s next? Brzezinski foresaw this international interdependent communitybeing funded by “a global taxation system.” How curious! This is exactly whatthe Bilderbergers have been pushing for the United Nations since the early1990s.Current Commission MembershipT he August 2007 roster of the Trilateral Commission includes members from everyEuropean nation. While in the past, the Asian group was made up of Japanesecommissioners, today’s Trilateral Commission has added new members from emergingAsian economies such as Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, aswell as seasoned capitalist centers such as Australia, New Zealand, South Koreaand Singapore.Furthermore, David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski, the Commission foundersand members of the Executive Committee from North America, have truly made theTrilateral Commission into a globalist organization. New Trilateralists fromsuch exotic locations as Kuwait, Morocco, Jordan and the Ukraine have joinedDomingo F. Cavallo, former Economy Minister of Argentina, and a man, accordingto many, responsible for destroying the Argentine economy. Carefully screenedcandidates from Taiwan, Turkey, Israel, Hong Kong, South Africa, Uruguay, China,Russia and Brazil have also been admitted. Excluding only equatorial Africa andthe Indian sub-continent the Trilateral Commission has truly expanded into aglobal powerhouse.Who are the people that form part of this “private” organization called theTrilateral Commission? Most are unknown, even to their countrymen, butinconsequential they are certainly not. They are present and past presidents,ambassadors, secretaries of state. Wall Street investors, international bankers,foundation executives, think tank executives, lobbyist lawyers, NATO andPentagon military leaders, wealthy industrialists, union bosses, media magnates,university presidents and key professors, select senators and congressmen, aswell as wealthy entrepreneurs. The largest proportion of TC membership comesfrom global corporations: United States, 34%; Western Europe, 39%; Japan, 65%.Back to the FutureHolly Sklar has explained why unions are included in the TC’s membership: “Alabor component helps control popular isolationism and reduces the distanceseparating Trilats from the masses of ordinary folk.”^^Originally, the difference between the Bilderbergers and the TC was that themuch older Bilderberg Group was limited in participation to NATO members fromWestern Europe, the U.S.A. and Canada. Today, the Group has expanded itsqualifications in step with the European Community and NATO and admits citizensof ex-Warsaw Pact nations into the Group.Although the Trilateral Commission paints itself as a harmless debating societyof private citizens who do not influence public policy, should we believe them?Why would Commission members give so much of their time to a mere academicexercise with so little significance?Journalist and researcher Robert Eringer notes in The Global Manipulators(Pentacle Books, 1980), that “many of the original members of the TrilateralCommission are now in positions of power where they are able to implement policyrecommendations of the Commission; recommendations that they, themselves,prepared on behalf of the Commission.”Could the Commission’s real objectives be to collaborate with the Bilderbergersand the Council of Foreign Relations in “establishing public policy objectivesto be implemented by governments worldwide”? That was Antony Sutton’s conclusionin Trilaterals Over America.After all, as Brzezinski noted in Between Two Ages, “Though the objective ofshaping a community of developed nations is less ambitious than the goal ofworld government, it is more attainable.”Debating society, indeed.At the Trilateral Commission’s 25th anniversary dinner in 1998, Henry Kissingerrevealed how the proposed establishment of the TC had been initially presentedto him:In 1973, when I served as Secretary of State, David Rockefeller showed up in myoffice one day to tell me that he thought 1 needed a little help. 1 mustconfess, the thought was not self-evident to me at the moment.He proposed to form a group of Americans, EuropeansThe True Story of the Biederberg Groupand lapanese to look ahead into the future.And I asked him, “Who’s going to run this for you,David?”He said, “Zbig Brzezinski.”/ knew that Rockefeller meant it. He picked something that was important. When Ithought about it, there actually was a need.^^ [emphases added]This “need” Kissinger refers to, but does not mention, related to his loss ofcontrol over the members of the Council of Foreign Relations as they grew evermore divided over the Viet Nam War. He suddenly “saw” the advantage in creatinga new global body that could supersede the CFR Rockefeller’s selection ofProfessor Zbigniew Brzezinski of Columbia University as the director of the neworganization made further sense to Kissinger, because Brzezinski’s ideas tocreate a vast alliance between North America, Western Europe and Japan not onlymirrored Rockefeller’s thinking, but also paralleled his own and that of CFRfounder Edward Mandell House."},{"pageContent":"However, according to an article by Will Banyon in Nexus magazine, in DavidRockefeller’s autobiography. Memoirs, Rockefeller fails to acknowledge his goalsin forming the Trilateral Commission. Evidently, Rockefeller was enraged withNixon’s New Economic Policy (NEP) of 1971, which tried to impose governmentmanagement over the most basic elements of the market through wage and pricecontrols and increased tariffs. For 90 days, Nixon succeeded in freezing wagesand prices to check inflation. Nixon’s position conflicted with Rockefeller’s,and Banyon captures the fervor with which Rockefeller was determined to rein inthe Nixon Administration, “which had taken advantage of Establishment divisionsto reject the liberal internationalist program.Daniel Yergin and Joseph Stanislaw, writing in The Commanding Heights, agreed:“the Establishment, represented by the TC, CFR and Bilderberg elite wereincensed that government officials were now in the business of setting pricesand wages.”Setting up the Trilateral Commission became Rockefeller’s plan to encourage“unity among the industrialized powers as a temporary alternative to a UnitedNations increasingly dominated by radicalized Third World states, so thattogether they could achieve his goal of a more integrated global political andeconomic structure.Back to the FutureMeanwhile, Rockefeller’s attempt to set the “erring” Nixon back on course via aprivate meeting to discuss the “international monetary and trade picture,” wasrebuffed by Nixon’s Chief of Staff, H. K. Haldeman. After finally securing themeeting with the President, Rockefeller’s views were dismissed by one of theofficials at the meeting as “not especially innovative.But what happened after that meeting is now history. Most of the NEP system wasabolished in April 1974, well into Nixon’s ill-fated second term.

In a few cases, two Triad members share a country — Taiwan and Singaporeare split between Japan and the U.S.; Argentina, between the U.S. and the EC;Malaysia, between the EC and Japan; and India is shared by all three.”“Rockefeller’s strategy,” writes Will Banyon “also reveals something fundamentalabout wealth and power: it does not matter how much money one has; unless it isemployed to capture and control those organizations that produce the ideas andthe policies that guide governments and the people who eventually serve in them,the real power of a great fortune will never be realized.Writing in a Letter to the Editor of the New York Times on August 20, 1980,David Rockefeller, chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank, defended the purpose ofthe Trilateral Commission in an unprecedentedThe True Story of the Bilderberg Grouppublic statement. “The Trilateral Commission is, in reality, a group ofconcerned citizens interested in fostering greater understanding, andcooperation among international allies.”This was not the impression held by U.S. Senator Barry Goldwater, however. Heput his view less mercifully. In his book. With No Apologies, he termed theTrilateral Commission, “David Rockefeller’s newest international cabal,” andsaid, “It is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of thecommercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political governmentof the United States.” Senator Jesse Helms, speaking from the Senate floor onDecember 15, 1987, went even further in his assessment of the interlockingprivate societies:This campaign against the American people — against traditional American cultureand values — is systematic psychological warfare.It is orchestrated by a vast array of interests comprising not only the Easternestablishment but also the radical left. Among this group, we find theDepartment of State, the Department of Commerce, the money center banks andmultinational corporations, the media, the educational establishment, theentertainment industry, and the large tax-exempt foundations.Mr. President, a careful examination of what is happening behind the scenesreveals that all of these interests are working to create what some refer to asa New World Order. Private organizations such as the Council on ForeignRelations, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, the TrilateralCommission, the Dartmouth Conference, the Aspen Institute for HumanisticStudies, the Atlantic Institute, and the Bilderberger Group serve to disseminateand to coordinate the plans for this so-called New World Order in powerfulbusiness, Hnancial, academic, and official circles....The influence of establishment insiders over our foreign policy has become afact of life in our time. This pervasive influence runs contrary to the reallong-term national security of our Nation. It is an influence which, ifunchecked, could ultimately subvert our constitutional order.^‘Isn’t that interesting! That’s exactly the conclusion that Antony Sutton reachesin the Trilateral Observer. “The Trilateralists have rejected the U.S.Constitution and the democratic political process.” Goldwater concludes With NoApologies with the following insight: “What the Trilaterals truly intend is thecreation of worldwideSophisticated Subversioneconomic power superior to the political governments of the nationstatesinvolved.... As managers and creators of the system, they will rule the future.”What these critics warn was happening in the ’70s and ’80s mirrors the veryimperial policies George Ball, the U.S. Undersecretary of State for EconomicAffairs under JFK and Lyndon Johnson, proposed at the 1968 Bilderberg meeting atMont Tremblant in Canada.As noted earlier. Ball framed the issue with a question: “Where does one find alegitimate base for the power of corporate managements to make decisions thatcan profoundly affect the economic life of nations to whose governments theyhave only limited responsibility?”The only answer that comes to mind is to orchestrate a crisis, one that binds“free” nations in common purpose against a world threat, whether economic,political or terrorist in nature. And this is the direction the Trilateralistspublicly take.Their methods were outlined in a candid 1974 report: The Crisis of Democracy,co-written by Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington, Michel Crozier (aFrench sociologist and member of the Academic des sciences morales etpolitiques) and Japanese Trilateralist Joji Watanuki. Their report suggested“the need for a dialectic game between the Department of State andmultinationals; the first one will have to exert pressure upon developingcountries for them to adopt liberal legislations and to quit nationalizations,while multinationals should transfer to the Department of State their knowledgeon the countries where they work.”The report further asserts that a democratic republic “is only one way ofconstituting authority, and it is not necessarily a universally applicableone... there are potentially desirable limits to the indefinite extension ofpolitical democracy... A government will have little ability, short ofcataclysmic crisis to impose on its people the sacrifice which may benecessary... In many situations, the claims of expertise, seniority, experienceand special talents may override the claims of democracy as a way ofconstituting authority.... The arenas where democratic procedures areappropriate are, in short, limited.”Sounds repressive, doesn’t it?The report also expressed anxiety at “the increased popular participation in andcontrol over established social, political, and economic institutions andespecially a reaction against the concentration of power of Congress and ofstate and local government.”The True Story oe the Bilderberg GroupIn other words, the Trilateralists are worried that people in a democraticsociety might rebel against the way they want to run things. So, to prevent suchresistance from happening, the Trilateralists recommend introducing powers ofdecree, says Gary Allen, to restore “a more equitable relationship betweengovernmental authority and popular control” through “centralized economic andsocial planning ... centralization of power within Congress ... a program tolower the job expectations of those who receive a college education.Of course, none of these initiatives can become truly effective without firstsubjugating the press and then putting it on a short leash. Therefore, theTrilateral Commission proposes limitations on freedom of the press such as“prior restraint of what newspapers may publish in unspecified unusualcircumstances, the assurance to the government [of] the right and the ability towithhold information at the source... moving promptly to reinstate the law oflibel as a necessary and appropriate check upon the abuses of power by thepress, and press councils enforcing ‘standards of professionalism,’ thealternative [to which] could well be regulation by the government.Make no mistake. The passages quoted here are not those published by critics ofthe Trilateral Commission. The wording comes directly from formal TrilateralCommission proposals.The idea of a “media control” and “media monopoly” that obfuscates the truth mayseem preposterous to many a Western person. Nevertheless, as early as 1983, BenBagdikian, the former editor of the Saturday Evening Post, in a book simplytitled The Media Monopoly, revealed the interlocking directorates among thefifty corporations that control what Americans see, hear and read. You mayrecall the earlier discussion of Bilderberg influence over U.S. media?Bagdikian’s most recent update the The New Media Monoploy (2004) puts the numberat five corporations controlling America’s Fourth Estate.Take the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, for example. PBS, supposedly, is apublic institution. According to its Web site, “PBS, is a non-profit mediaenterprise owned and operated by the nation’s ... public television stations. Atrusted community resource, PBS uses the power of noncommercial television, theInternet and other media to enrich the lives of all Americans through qualityprograms and education services that inform, inspire and delight. Available to99 percent of American homes with televisions and to an increasingSophisticated Subversionnumber of digital multimedia households, PBS serves nearly 90 million peopleeach week.”^\"*The cornerstone of PBS’s programming is the evening television news program, TheNewsHour with Jim Lehrer. Jim Lehrer, however, is a member of the Council onForeign Relations. For most of PBS’ history, funding was provided by AT&T [a CFRcompany]; Archer Daniels Midland, whose Chairman Dwayne Andreas was a member ofthe Trilateral Commission; PepsiCo [a CFR company], whose newly promoted ChiefExecutive Officer, Indra Krishnamurthy Nooyi, is a Bilderberger and a TrilateralCommission Executive Committee member; and Smith Barney [a CFR company], one ofthe world’s leading financial institutions. Furthermore, Smith Barney isinterlocked with Citigroup Inc., a global financial services company that is amember of the Bilderberg Group, the CFR and the Trilateral Commission.Journalists who participate in The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer are some of thebest-known political pundits in the United States, such as Paul Gigot, DavidGergen, William Kristol and William Sahre. All of them belong to the BilderbergGroup, the CFR or the Trilateral Commission.Would it be reasonable for us to suspect that PBS might not be quite asimpartial in certain delicate matters of public interest, such as the U.S.Constitutional crisis envisioned by Brzezinski, the future of nation-states, andof national sovereignty?Three years after publishing The Crisis of Democracy, Samuel Huntington, amember of the CFR and TC, was promoted to the post of coordinator of nationalsecurity planning for Jimmy Carter’s National Security Council. As the Council’scoordinator, Huntington drafted Presidential Review Memorandum 32 |PRM 32],which led to Carter’s presidential order creating the Federal EmergencyManagement Agency on June 19, 1979. FEMA, the crisis command center, does notoperate under the orders of the President, but under the National SecurityCouncil whose members belong to the Bilderberg/CFR/TC combines and interlockedleadership. One of FEMA’s past directors is the ubiquitous Zbigniew Brzezinski,the prognosticator of one-world idealism.Craig S. Karpel wrote “Cartergate: The Death of Democracy” for Penthouse'sNovember 1977 edition. “The presidency of the United States and key cabinetdepartments of the federal government,” heThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupasserted, “have been taken over by a private organization dedicated to thesubordination of the domestic interests of the United States to theinternational interests of the multi-national banks and corporations. It wouldbe unfair to say that the Trilateral Commission dominates the CarterAdministration; the Trilateral Commission is the Carter Administration.”Karpel’s words may seem like a gross exaggeration until we note HenryKissinger’s declaration to the head of state of Canada, a neighboring countryand a staunch ally of the United States: “Jimmy Carter is not the President ofthe United States,” said Kissinger. “The Trilateral Commission is the Presidentof the United States; I represent the Trilateral Commission.” This was reportedto me by persons within earshot of the conversation.Are you still not convinced we are facing a grave threat to our individualfreedoms and democratic way of life? Here are a few more examples.Richard Cooper, a Maurits C. Boas Professor of International Economics atHarvard, headed the Trilateral Commission’s task force on monetary policy, whichrecommended selling official gold reserves to private markets. When Cooper wasnamed the U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, the InternationalMonetary' Fund sold a portion of its gold.In 1976, C. Fred Bergsten along with Georges Berthoin and Kinhide Mushakojiprepared Commission Task Force Report #11 called The Reform of InternationalInstitutions. They stated their “overriding goal”: making the world “safe forinterdependence.” This was to be achieved by “checking of the intrusion ofnational governments into the international exchange of both economic andnon-economic goods” (p. 90). Bergsten went on to become Assistant Secretary forInternational Affairs of the U.S. Treasury during 1977-81.Trilateralist John C. Sawhill, along with Keichi Oshima and Hanns W. Maull,authored the Commission’s 1978 Task Force Report #17— Energy: Managing theTransition. It made recommendations about how to manage a movement tohigher-cost energy. On September 12, 1979, Carter appointed John Sawhill to beDeputy Secretary of Energy.With what we have noted so far, it isn’t too difficult to see that theTrilateral Commission’s approach is strictly economic. “Interlockingdirectorates and world market shares provide the greatest politicalSophisticated Subn'ersionpower because individual transnational corporations participate not asindividual or autonomous companies but as parts of a whole network or integratedsystems. The Trilateral Commission is the further extension of this network.”^^Political conditions, such as the ideals of nation-states, common law, andsocial welfare are anathemas to their materialist plans. Freedom — spiritual,political and economic — is frowned upon, and its necessity denied anyimportance in the Trilateralist vision of global financial partnership andinterdependence. All these criteria are best summed up in the infamous words ofRichard Gardner, one of Carter’s mentors, in the July 1974 issue of the CFR’smagazine. Foreign Affairs. In it, Gardner called for “an end run around nationalsovereignty, eroding it piece by piece.”The Trilateral/Bilderberg/CFR model is composed of top financial managers andEstablishment insiders. The key, however, to achieving the centralized power theTC covets is finding “a way to get us to surrender our liberties in the name ofsome common threat or crisis. The foundations, educational institutions, andresearch think tanks supported by members of the Trilateral Commission andCouncil on Foreign Relations oblige by financing so-called ‘studies’ which arethen used to justify their every excess. The excuses vary, but the target isalways individual liberty. Our liberty.”^^And despite the primarily financial nature of both their motives and methods,they are not without political goals: “Although the Commission’s primary concernis economic, the Trilateralists have pinpointed a vital political objective: togain control of the American Presidency.”^^picture62 [images/picture62.jpg]IBcsir y\\^isUes*'~iv 'RockeJislLer'/y/*Chapter TwentyPACKAGING A PRESIDENTI n the spring of 1972, a high profile group of men gathered for dinner with W.Averell Harriman, the grand old man of the Democratic Party, a Bilderberger andmember of the CFR. Also present were Milton Katz, a GFR member and Director ofInternational Studies at Harvard, Robert Bowie, who would later become DeputyDirector of the CIA, George Franklin, David Rockefeller’s coordinator for theTrilateral Commission, and Gerald Smith, U.S. Ambassador-at-Large forNon-Proliferation Matters. The focus of their discussion was the not-too-distant1976 U.S. Presidential elections. Harriman suggested that if the Democratswanted to recapture the White House, “we had better get off our high horses andlook at some of those southern governors.” Several names cropped up. Among themwere James Earl Carter, governor of Georgia, Reubin Askew, governor of Florida,and Terry Sanford, former governor of North Carolina and, at the time. Presidentof Duke University.Katz is reported to have promptly informed David Rockefeller that Carter was aviable candidate and could be sold politically to the American public. In thefall of 1973, Rockefeller invited Carter for dinner in London, in order tobetter acquaint himself with Georgia’s governor. As he listened to the southerngentleman, he became convinced that Carter was ideally suited to become the nextU.S. president.The Times of London gave an account of the developing Rockefeller-Carterrelationship: “Governor Jimmy Carter, 1976 DemocraticThe True Story of the Bii.derberg GroupPresidential candidate, has for reasons known only to himself professed to be aninnocent abroad, but the record is somewhat different. As Governor of Georgia, astate aspiring to be the centre of the New South, he led the state trademissions abroad. While in London in the autumn of 1973 he dined with anotherAmerican visitor, but by no means an innocent, Mr. David Rockefeller of ChaseManhattan Bank. Mr. Rockefeller was then establishing, with the help ofProfessor Brzezinski of Columbia University, an international group now known asthe Trilateral Commission. He was looking for American members... was impressedby the Governor, if only because he had ventured abroad, and invited him tojoin. Governor Carter, perhaps because he was already eyeing the White Housefrom afar, was only too happy to accept.”Rockefeller felt that Carter “could project an image of a Southern Governor thatcould be used to fool many voters by appearing ‘conservative’ or ‘moderate,’while in fact favoring the most left-wing of agendas. The idea was to use Carterto court both Wliite and Black voters who could be delivered by the DemocratParty’s big urban political machines.In fact, before moving forward, we should backtrack to the “screening” processand to 1973. That year. Carter and Askew were invited to David Rockefeller’sTarrytown, New York estate. Also present was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who washelping Rockefeller screen prospects for the Trilateral Commission. Carter’ssouthern gentility charmed both men, but what impressed them more was thatCarter had already opened up trade offices for the state of Georgia in Brusselsand Tokyo. This seemed to fit perfectly with the aspirations of the TrilateralCommission.However, what truly impressed them wasn’t Carter’s independence. Rather, whatendeared Carter to the Establishment crowd was his ruthlessness and ambition. AsGary Allen writes in his controversial 1976 book, Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Carter:“Carter’s overwhelming ambition and corruptibility made him vulnerable. Itincluded conniving with his own personal banker, Bert Lance, to funnel bankdepositors’ money into Carter’s peanut business and into the bank accounts ofLance associates and family members to finance Carter’s campaign, while waitingfor federal matching funds. The illegalities involved were enough to send thewhole gang to jail. And the key to exposure was in the hands of DavidRockefeller and his fellow banking insiders.”Packaging a PresidentThus, a peanut farmer was plucked out of the peanut field by the CFR/Bilderbergand soon-to-be Trilateral Commission organizations and “discovered” as apotential presidential candidate.In Carter’s acceptance speech after winning the nomination at the DemocraticNational Convention, he attacked the “unholy, self-perpetuating alliances [that]have been formed between money and politics... a political and economic elitewho have shaped decisions and never had to account for mistakes nor to sufferfrom injustice. When unemployment prevails, they never stand in line for a job.When deprivation results from a confused welfare system, they never do withoutfood, or clothing or a place to sleep. Wlien public schools are inferior or tornby strife, their children go to exclusive private schools. And when bureaucracyis bloated and confused, the powerful always manage to discover and occupyniches of special influence and privilege.”On the basis of the last paragraph, one may actually feel inclined to believethat Jimmy Carter truly was an outsider. But, was he really? Let’s see. Twelveindividuals belonging to the CFR/TC combines, according to a June 1976 articlein the Los Angeles Times, helped Carter prepare his first major speech onforeign policy: Zbigniew Brzezinski, Richard Cooper, Richard Gardner, HenryOwen, Edwin O. Reischauer, Averell Harriman, Anthony Lake, Robert Bowie, MiltonKatz, Abram Chayes, George Ball and Cyrus Vance. With a writing team like this,how could Carter come up with a bad political speech? But each of these men wasan insider heavyweight with an agenda. Most belonged to the Bilderberg Group.All were members of the Council on Foreign Relations and the TrilateralCommission. In the speech they created for Carter, they created what theAmerican people craved to hear from a prospective leader.Carter’s early support group from Atlanta, in his pre-candidate days, featuredseveral people “with very close ties to the Rockefeller family, such asGambrell, Kirbo and Austin.The “outsider” Gambrell family was a majorshareholder in Eastern Airlines, where David’s brother Laurence Rockefeller wasthe biggest individual shareholder.However, Carter played the role of an outsider to perfection. And, immediatelyupon entering the White House, he filled many of the administrative positionswith CFR and Trilateralist insiders. An astounding 40% of the AmericanTrilateral members joined the CarterThe True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAdministration. In all, 291 members of either the CFR or TC or both formed partof the Carter presidency; among them, of course, both President Carter and VicePresident Mondale.The December 2, 1976 edition of the Wall Street Journal covered the screening ofsixteen prospects in Plains, Georgia, and reported that Cyrus Vance,Trilateralist, was to be given the post of Secretary of State. At the time, hewas a director of IBM, Pan-Am Airways, and a member of the Foreign Policy TaskForce, vice-chairman of the CFR as well as a former Deputy Director of Defense.With such an associate. Carter could hardly be called an outsider. MichaelBlumenthal, a Trilateralist and a member of the CFR, was given the post ofSecretary of Treasury. This appointment was quickly followed by that of HaroldBrown, TC/CFR, to the post of Secretary of Defense. Zbigniew Brzezinski,Bilderberg, CFR/TC, was chosen to become Carter’s National Security Advisor.Andrew Young, CFR, TC, became U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and Paul A.Volcker became Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.U.S. News and World Report took note of the unmistakable influence ofTrilateralists on Jimmy Carter: “The Trilateralists have taken charge of foreignpolicy-making in the Carter Administration, and already the immense power theywield is sparking some controversy. Active or former members of the TrilateralCommission now head every key agency involved in mapping U.S. strategy fordealing with the rest of the world.”In fact, if we are to compare Carter’s words in 1976 to what Ronald Reagan saidduring his campaign against Carter in 1980, as quoted in Time’s issue of October20, we may be shocked at the similarity of language and ideas. These areReagan’s words: “I think there is an elite in this country, and they are thevery ones who run an elitist government. They want a government by a handful ofpeople because they don’t believe the people themselves can run their lives...Are we going to have an elitist government that makes decisions for people’slives, or are we going to believe as we have for so many decades, that thepeople can make these decisions for themselves?”Was Reagan an anti-Trilateralist? Hardly. Reagan’s campaign was managed byWilliam J. Casey, former Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission andReagan’s future Director of the CIA. Casey was a full-fledged Trilateralist.Active CFR and Trilateralist members such as Caspar Weinberger, Anne Armstrong,David Packard, GeorgePackaging a PresidentH. Weyerhauser, Bill Brock and William A. Hewitt helped manage Reagan’scampaign.Additionally, Reagan’s 59-member transition team responsible for selection andscreening of candidates for major governmental posts consisted of 28 CFRmembers, 10 Bilderbergers and 10 Trilateralists. Amongst them figured such“outsiders” as Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, George Shultz (former Secretaryof Treasury under Nixon), Donald Rumsfeld and Alan Greenspan.Yet, this maneuvering would never have become nearly as effective or evenpossible had it not been for the close cooperation between the media and peopleunder the control of the Bilderberger/CFR/TC apparatus. When in December 1975,seven months before the Democratic National Convention, the Gallup Pollindicated that only 5% of registered Democrats wanted Carter as President,alarms went off in the plush offices of David Rockefeller. For Carter to win thenomination, they needed to create the most elaborate media campaign in history —just like the media circus we have come to expect today from any top name in theentertainment industry — all in the effort to convince the electorate that JamesEarl Carter was indeed America’s only hope for a better future.But, former Georgia Governor Lester Maddox spoke out against Carter’s candidacy:“Based on false, misleading and deceiving statements and actions... JimmyCarter, in my opinion, neither deserves or should expect one vote from theAmerican people.”Nevertheless, the American people, with the help of incessant bombardment fromthe media, convinced themselves that Carter was indeed their first choice.Cyrus Vance (CFR), then on the board of the New York Times, and Hedley Donovan,then editor-in-chief of Time magazine, (a CFR/TC member as well as director ofthe Carnegie Endowment for International Peace) used Time’s elaborate range ofresources to aid Carter’s campaign. First, Time painted Carter as an “outsiderwith no connections to the corrupt politics of Washington.”^'But of course Time had been pushing Carter for sometime: “After Time devoted aflattering 1971 cover photo to him as a progressive Southern governor, it usedthat cover photo in all of Time’s ads in other magazines through 1975. The Timereports on the Carter campaign were so adulatory that they could scarcely bedifferentiated from the campaign’s own literature.”\"^The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupSenator Barry Goldwater was definitely not a Carter fan. In his book With NoApologies, he wrote, “David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found JimmyCarter to be their ideal candidate. They helped him win the nomination, and thepresidency.”Candidate Carter went from five percent support among Democrats to becomingalmost overnight the candidate of choice. “To accomplish this purpose,”explained Coldwater, “they mobilized the money power of the Wall Street bankers,the intellectual influence of the academic community — which is subservient tothe wealth of the great tax-free foundations — and the media controllersrepresented in the membership of the CFR and the Trilateral.”In his ensuing 1976 presidential campaign and stump speeches. Carter’s repeatedthemes became twin mantras: “The time has come to replace balance-of-powerpolitics with world order politics” and to “seek a partnership between NorthAmerica, Western Europe and Japan.Where have we heard this before? Doesn’t it sound as ifjimmy Carter wasparroting the TC’s mission statements? His emphasis on world order and tradingpartners definitely indicated Trilateralist views.In campaigning against Carter’s presidential candidacy, the publisher of theManchester Union Leader, William Loeb, made the Trilateral Commission an issueduring the New Hampshire primary: “It is quite clear that this group ofextremely powerful men is out to control the world.”The selection of Jimmy Carter for the office of the President is one of the bestillustrations of the market value of political contact — who you know, not whoyou are, wins the most votes. At the same time, it also demonstrates how easilythe lack of market value can crush the presidential aspirations of anon-favorite like Senator Barry Coldwater.Both John Kerry and Ceorge W. Bush have also been financed by the same elitecombines — the Bilderberg Croup, the Council on Foreign Relations and theTrilateral Commission. But, it really doesn’t matter who wins. The epicenter ofpower always seems to remain in the hands of the people with a One WorldCovernment-One World Company agenda.Chapter Twenty-OneGAME OF MONOPOLY\"TW \"T\" owhere,” writes Gary Allen in Chapter Nine of The I I Rockefeller File,“do we find any policy determinations JL 1 [of the Trilateral Commission] infavor of individual free enterprise and individual freedoms.”This complete rejection of free enterprise and individual freedom is puzzling.How can Marxism, and its resulting system of social and economic equalization,fascinate David Rockefeller, or the Trilateral Commission? Rockefeller is notonly rich; he is well-educated. He knows the failure of Marxism in the form ofCommunism under ruthless dictators like Stalin in the twentieth century, inwhich an estimated 100 million citizens were slaughtered under the Communistregime, over a billion more enslaved.How do we reconcile the mental image of a Capitalist embracing a Marxist, or anyCommunist/Socialist? The reason for the apparent incongruity is in our learneddefinitions of these words.In school, we are taught Capitalism is based on free enterprise. Capitalists arewealthy entrepreneurs, people who go into business for themselves to make money,and you can’t make money unless you produce profits. This is the cornerstone offree enterprise. Worldwide, free enterprise becomes free trade in a globalmarketplace. Everyone works to make money, which produces proHts to invest inmore businesses and industries that make money to create more jobs that spreadwealth and build a higher standard of life for all. The goods and servicesproduced are the collaborative result of individual imagination and innovation.“Whatever the mind can conceive, it can achieve.” TheThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupindividual “owns” his job, his business, his property. Whatever he earns forhimself, he keeps and can spend in any way he chooses. Individual wealthgenerates state wealth through the application of taxes.Not so for a Marxist, as we u nderstand Marxi sm. Everything is for the state;nothing is for the individual. Under Marxist, Communist or socialist systems,private ownership is banned. A one-party political structure controls thestate’s economic planning, in which the people receive an equal distribution ofgoods and property. There is no incentive to excel at a job or to implementimprovements to the state’s methods of working, because there is no recognitionof individual effort.So, why should anyone seriously believe the apparent contradiction that bankersof the magnitude of Rockefeller, Morgan and the Rothschilds, the mainstays ofour Free Enterprise system, would voluntarily support and finance an“anti-capitalist. Godless” revolution for Communists? How would the West, theparagon of capitalism and freedom, benefit from such a program?The magic word is monopoly, “an all-encompassing monopoly” that not onlycontrols the government, the monetary system and all property, but is also a“monopoly which, like the corporations it emulates, is self-perpetuating andeternal.We’ve seen monopoly power under state control in the Soviet Union and China.Under their Communist regimes, rather than create an economic system of equaldistribution, some people were treated more equal than others, depending ontheir rank and stature in the state hierarchy. Those enjoying the most perksheaded the state. However, following Mikhail Gorbachev’s glasnost, which openedup the state to public inquiry, the Soviet Union’s Communist system dissolved.Ironically, the inequality of economic wealth hasn’t improved since Russia’smove to a free market, nor have the former provinces experienced a betterstandard of living after regaining their independence. Instead, th e RussianMaHa has taken advantage of the new capitalism to exercise a corrupt power overa laim furtherWictimized. Meanwhile the merger of Communism with capitalism isseeing phenomenal success and economic growth in China. In fact, China isemerging as the next super power, all because it is practising what the West’sfinancial elite and Bilderbergers covet for their one-world order: state-plannedcapitalism.The fact is that members of the Establishment operating through “private”organizations such as the Bilderbergers, the CFR and theGame of MonopolyTrilateral Commission understand socialism as the ultimate power system forcontrol, a nd understand its ps ychology better than the Marxists do.^This iswhy their members push through Congress such ^ anti-capitalist programs asWelfare Reform and Regulation. Socialism to them, again, is not a system toredistribute wealth from the rich \\to the poor. Rather it’s a mechanism forgaining a greater and greaterconcentration of power and control.^ For example, by giving generous loans to Third World nations to help themdevelop their economies, the national banks actually make more profit and flexgreater power internationally. How do they manage to do this? Let’s go back to1976. Then, the Big Five New York banks (all run by members of the TrilateralCommission and Council on Foreign Relations) loaned over $52 billion to severalThird World and Communist countries, “many of which were already having a hardtime paying just the interest, let alone the principal. So, the Trilateralistsdemanded, and got, an ‘overhauled’ International Monetary Fund, subsidized forthe most part by the American taxpayer, which loaned money to these deadbeatThird World countries to allow them to meet their obligations to the big banks.And, of course, the money injected into the International Monetary Fund to dothis is paid for by still more and more domestic inflation,” explains Gary Allenin The Rockefeller File.In Confessions of a Monopolist published in 1906, Frederick C. Howe talked abouthow the strategy works in practice: “The rules of big business: Get a monopoly;let Society work for you. So long as we see all international revolutionariesand all international capitalists as implacable enemies of one another, then wemiss a crucial point ... a partnership between international monopoly capitalismand international revolutionary socialism is for their mutual benefit.”Gary Allen in his underground bestseller. None Dare Call it Conspiracy,describes how, through absolute control, the wealthy can create and perpetuate amonopoly. “Control necessitates a static society. A growing, competitive, andfree society gives new people a chance to make their fortune and replace some ofthose already at the top. So, legislation is promoted to restrictentrepreneurial effort and tax away capital accumulations not protected in thetax-free foundations of the Establishment insiders. Fwery effort is made topress a medium-size business to the wall and allow it to be swallowed up by theEstablishment giants.”The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupThe insiders’ drive to stifle competition is no different from the way Americanrailroad owners between 1877 and 1916 used the Interstate Commerce Commission toretain state control of railroads, which effectively gave them monopoly power.^^In The Rockefeller File, Allen notes the subversive manner of imposingmonopolies: “By the late nineteenth century, the inner sanctums of Wall Streetunderstood that the most efficient way to gain an unchallenged monopoly was tosay it was for the ‘public good’ and the ‘public interest.’”Brzezinski too recognized the value of a monopoly under Marxism, as did DavidRockefeller. David learned it at the feet of his father, John D., Jr. “Junior,”as he was known, hated competition, and his children were taught that the onlycompetition worth having is the one where you control both sides of theequation.“To the Rockefellers,” reports Gary Allen, “socialism is not a system forredistributing wealth — especially not for redistributing their wealth — but asystem to control people and competitors. Socialism puts power in the hands ofthe government. And since the Rockefellers control the government, governmentcontrol means Rockefeller control. You may not have known this, but you can besure they do!”^^This reality is the optimum benefit of monopoly power. Thus, we shouldn’t besurprised that what international financiers favor in the formation of a “WorldCompany” of cartels is their ability to control world finance, markets, naturalresources and, ultimately, people.At the beginning of the 1900s, however, Marxism was still a new economic theory,and American power brokers and financiers gleaned from it another way to goafter “markets that could be exploited monopolistically without fear ofcompetition,” states Antony Sutton in his book. Wall Street and the BolshevikRevolution}^Chapter Twenty-TwoBOLSHEVIKS’ BENEFACTORSH ad the Bolshevik Revolution failed, Russia’s industrial development wouldsurely have rivaled that of the United States, Great Britain and Europe, and wewould have been living in a very different world today. But, by supporting theBolshevik Revolution, American financiers slowed down Russian industrial growthto a snail’s pace in the lead-up to World War II. They prevented Russia fromemerging as a super power, while the Soviet industry that did develop wascontrolled by Wall Street bankers and investors behind the scenes.From the outset, a key player in the financial support of the Russian Revolutionwas Scottish-born Andrew Carnegie, an American steel magnate who in 1892 ownedthe largest steel company in the world. Carnegie also evolved into the richestphilanthropist of his time and supported what he considered worthy causes. Hebelieved a “man who dies rich dies disgraced.” By his death in 1919, he hadgiven away $350 million dollars, and one of the organizations he created todisperse his wealth was the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Because Carnegiehad witnessed the horrors of the Civil War as a young man, he donated $10million to establish the Endowment for International Peace, whose mandate was toprevent future wars from happening. Under this direction, the Endowment’s boardof trustees formulated the Marburg Plan.The objective of this Plan, writes Jennings C. Wise in Woodrow Wilson: Discipleof Revolution, was to weld “international financiers and the socialists into amovement to compel the formation of a league [the League of Nations, theprecursor of the United Nations] to enforceThe True Story of the Bii.derberg Grouppeace... and to control its councils... [and so] provide a specific for all thepolitical ills of mankind.This Plan was formed on the heels of World War I, the most dreadflil of warsbased on loss of life for both the Allies (which included Russia) and theCentral Powers. “To enforce peace” was a politically correct motive then, and anideal Carnegie was proud to strive for. There is a hidden assumption, however.To “enforce” peace also implies that war must be created as a necessaryprerequisite, and Carnegie may not have been aware of the secret intent buriedin the Marburg blueprint that his board of trustees prepared for the future.Antony Sutton provides us with the background preceding the Marburg Plan tocoordinate international governments under the “ultimate power” of financialcontrollers. “Russia was then — and is today — the largest untapped market inthe world. Moreover, Russia, then and now, constituted the greatest potentialcompetitive threat to American industrial and financial supremacy.”^^Thus, Sutton further explains, the creators of the Marburg Plan needed todevelop a monopoly that encircled the globe, not just their own backyard. “Wliatthe Interstate Commerce Commission and the Federal Trade Commission under thethumb of American industry could achieve for that industry at home, a plannedsocialist government could achieve for it abroad — given suitable support andinducements from Wall Street and Washington, D.C.”'^^Seedbed for DiscontentA t the turn of the twentieth century. Tsar Nicholas II ruled Russia. He was thelast Romanov to reign, in a dynasty that lasted from 1613 to 1917. Before WorldWar 1, his empire covered 8,500,000 square miles, and bordered Turkey, Persia,Afghanistan, Mongolia and China, while Poland, the Baltic States and Finlandwere Russian territories. According to Major-General Sir John Hanbury Williams,a British officer stationed in Russia during the War, the loyalty of the tsar“to the Allied cause was only equalled by his determination to Hght out the warto the bitter end.”The Romanovs had been westernizing Russia since the reign of Peter the Great,and Nicholas II intended to modernize Russian industry to equal the standard ofEuropean technology. Unfortunately, he was taking advantage of his labor forceto do it. Many were working 12-Bolsheviks’ Benefactorshour shifts for minimal wages, and this set the stage for the organized workers’protest in St. Petersburg on “Bloody Sunday” in 1905. The tsar’s troops,however, squashed this first attempt at a revolt. The old order maintainedprecarious power through the first years of the War, until an opportunity roseagain in 1918 to achieve the overthrow of the monarchy, and the eventualexecution of Nicholas II and his family.So, it is interesting to learn in Gyeorgos C. Hatonn’s book. Rape of theConstitution; Death of Freedom, that John D. Rockefeller’s personal emissary,George Kennan, spent twenty years promoting revolutionary activity against theTsar in Russia. His presence and influence made it easy for American capitaliststo exploit the “captive” Russian market under the guise of well-meaning aid todowntrodden rebels.Why were Rockefeller and his band of bankers so anxious to overthrow the Russianmonarchy? Was there another, more relevant reason to advance the RussianRevolution?In one word: Yes. The answer is as meaningful today as it was one hundred yearsago. Oil! Before the Bolshevik revolt, Russia had surpassed the U.S. as theworld’s number one oil producer.^* In 1900, the oil-saturated Baku fields inRussia were producing more crude oil than the United States and, in 1902,produced more than half of the total world output.The chaos and destruction of the Revolution destroyed the Russian oil industry.In Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution, Sutton writes: “By 1922, half thewells were idle,” and the other half barely functioning, because they lacked thetechnology to make them operational.^^In The Rockefeller File, Gary Allen also notes that the revolution crushedAmerica’s competition. “The Revolution effectively eliminated Standard Oil’scompetition from Russia for several years until Standard could move in and get apiece of the Russian oil business.”But, for the Wall Street bankers to wipe out their competition and condemn theRussian people to poverty and corruption for decades, they had to have leaderswho could deliver a successful revolution. Enter Vladimir Ulyanov Lenin and LeonTrotsky.Main Actors on StageS ounding rather like Brzezinski more than 50 years later, Lenin outlined hisideas in The Threatening Catastrophe, in September, 1917:The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupNationalization of the banks. Ownership of capital, which is manipulated by thebanks is not lost or changed when the banks are nationalized and fused into onestate bank, so that it is possible to reach a stage where the state knowswhither and how, from where and at what time millions and billions are flowing.Only control over bank operations, providing they are merged into one statebank, will allow, simultaneously with other measures, which can easily be putinto effect the actual levying of income tax without concealment of property andincome. The state for the first time would be in a position to survey all themonetary operations, then to control them, then to regulate economic life;finally, to obtain millions and billions for large state operations, withoutpaying the capitalist gentlemen sky-high commissions for their services. Itwould facilitate the nationalization of syndicates, abolition of commercialsecrets, and the nationalization of the insurance business; facilitate thecontrol of and the compulsory organization of labor into unions, and theregulation of consumption. The nationalization of banks would make circulationof checks compulsory by law for all the rich, and introduce the confiscation ofproperty for concealing incomes. The five points [sic] of the desired programthen, are nationalization of the banks, nationalization of the syndicates, theabolition of commercial secrets, and the compulsory organization of thepopulation into consumer associations.^^It is no coincidence that one of the first orders issued by the new Bolshevikregime was, “The banking business is declared a state monopoly.” One of thenames signed on the order was Lenin’s.Trotsky published a book in 1918, The Bolsheviks and World Peace. In it, Trotskyparrots Lenin but proclaims himself' an “internationalist” — not a Russian — whois for world revolution and for world dictatorship. Immediately, we see whatbonds American bankers to these two Bolshevik leaders: their concept of“internationalism” matches their own.Money Laundering BrethrenD oes anyone still think that the Bolshevik revolution was a spontaneousuprising? This is what John Reed would have us believe in his best-known work.Ten Days that Shook the World. Reed, who died of typhus in Russia in 1920, wasnot only a popular author in the World War I era; he also contributed to theJ.P.Morgan-controlled journal. Metropolitan. Is this mere coincidence?Bolsheviks’ BenefactorsEven though channels linking the Rockefellers and the Soviets have been largelycensored, Antony Sutton’s detailed document, Wall Street and the BolshevikRevolution, exposes how John D. Rockefeller and American super capitalistsfinanced the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia At the outset of his investigation,he found “virtually nothing written on the close relationship over the pastcentury that the Rockefellers have had with its supposed arch-enemies, theCommunists. [Nevertheless,] there has been a continuing, albeit concealed,alliance between international political capitalists and internationalrevolutionary socialists to their mutual benefit.”^''For example, Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett, the leading Wall Street law firmspecializing in reorganizations and mergers was firmly behind the Bolshevikregime in Russia. “As one indication of their support,” writes Sutton, “partnerThomas D. Thacher wrote a report which became decisive in gaining Britishcabinet support for the Bolsheviks... This memorandum not only made explicitsuggestions about Russian policy that supported the pro-Bolshevik position ofWilliam Boyce Thompson, the then director of Chase, now Chase Manhattan Bank,but even stated that ‘the fullest assistance should be given to the Sovietgovernment in its efforts to organize a volunteer revolutionary army.’”It Is worth noting that one of Simpson, Thacher and Bartlett’s alumni was theyoung Cyrus Vance, who would later become President Carter’s Secretary of Stateand, following that, a senior director of the Rockefeller Foundation. Smallworld, indeed.One of the Wall Street firms involved with the Bolsheviks was J.P. Morgan, aswas revealed in Harold Nicholson’s biography of Morgan partner Dwight Morrow,the father-in-law of Charles Lindbergh, Jr.:[Morrow’s] interest in Russia dated from March 1917 when Thomas D. Thacher, hislaw partner, had been a member of the American Red Cross Mission during therevolution. It was strengthened by his friendship with Alex Gumberg, who hadcome to New York as representative of the All-Russian Textile Syndicate.‘I have felt,’ he wrote in May 1927, ‘that the time would come when somethingwould have to be done for Russia.’ He was himself active in furthering officialrelations between Soviet emissaries and the State Dept., and he provided M.Litvinov with a warm letter of recommendation to Sir Arthur Salter in Geneva.Nor was this all. When in Paris, he gave a dinner party at 1^'oyot’s, to whichhe invited M. Rikovsky and other Soviet representatives.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAnother mega-organization supporting the Bolshevik cause was the Federal ReserveBank of New York, controlled by the five principal New York banks. In TheUnknown War with Russia, Robert}. Maddox noted in 1977, “William LaurenceSanders, chairman of Ingersoll ILmd, and deputy chairman of the Federal ReserveBank of New York, wrote to President Wilson, on October 17, 1918, ‘I am insympathy with the Soviet form of government as the best suited for the Russianpeople.’ George Foster Peabody, also deputy chairman of the Federal Reserve Bankof New York since 1914, and noted philanthropist, who organized the GeneralEducation Board for the Rockefellers, stated that he supported the Bolshevikform of state monopoly.”The scam boggles the mind when we consider that three of the top officers of theFederal Reserve Bank of New York publicly supported Bolshevism — Sanders,Peabody and William Boyce Thompson.Current knowledge makes clear that Wall Street bankers reacted with help asearly as 1905, when Lenin and Trotsky’s initial rebellion had failed. Theyarranged safe passage for Lenin to Switzerland, where he remained out of harm’sway.Trotsky after 1905 had lived in exile, notes Antony Sutton in Wall Street andthe Bolshevik Revolution, first in France. But after writing rabble-rousingarticles for a Russian-language newspaper in Paris in September 1916, the Frenchpolice escorted him across the Spanish border.A few days later, Madrid police arrested him and lodged him in a ‘first-classcell’ at a charge of one-and-one-half pesetas per day. Subsequently, Trotsky wastaken to Cadiz, then to Barcelona and finally placed on board the SpanishTransatlantic Company steamer Monserrjt. Trotsky and family crossed the AtlanticOcean and landed in New York on January 13, 1917.How did Trotsky, who knew only German and Russian, survive in capitalistAmerica? According to his autobiography. My Life [Scribner’s, 1930], “My onlyprofession in New York was that of a revolutionary socialist.” In other words,Trotsky wrote occasional articles for Novy Mir, the New York Russian socialistjournal. Yet we know that the Trotsky family apartment in New York had arefrigerator and a telephone, and, according to Trotsky, that the familyoccasionally traveled in a chauffeured limousine. This mode of living puzzledthe two young Trotsky boys. When they went into a tearoom, the boys wouldanxiously demand of their mother, “Why doesn’t the chauffeur come in?” Thestylish living standardBolsheviks’ Benefactorsis also at odds with Trotsky’s reported income. The only funds that Trotskyadmits receiving in 1916 and 1917 are $310, and, said Trotsky, “I distributedthe $310 among five emigrants who were returning to Russia.” Yet Trotsky hadpaid for a first-class cell in Spain, the Trotsky family had traveled acrossEurope to the United States, they had acquired an excellent apartment in NewYork — paying rent three months in advance — and they had use of a chauffeuredlimousine. All this on the earnings of an impoverished revolutionary for a fewarticles for the low-circulation Russian-language newspaper Nashe Slovo in Parisand Novy Mir in New York!By then, the American International Corporation had already been founded in NewYork in 1915. Its principal responsibility was to coordinate financialassistance to the Bolsheviks. J.P. Morgan, the Rockefellers, and the NationalCity Bank provided the funding, while the new corporation’s Chairman of theBoard was Frank Vanderlip, former president of National City Bank, and member ofthe Jekyll Island group, which had written the Federal Reserve Act in 1910.According to Eustace Mullins in The World Order, the Bolsheviks sought morefunds shortly after their return to Russia:To whom should Lenin turn but his powerful friend in the White House? Wilsonpromptly sent Elihu Root, Kuhn Loeb lawyer and former Secretary of State, toRussia with $20 million from his Special War Fund, to be given to theBolsheviks. This was revealed in Congressional Hearings on Russian Bonds, HJ8714.U5, which shows the financial statement of Woodrow Wilson’s expenditure ofthe $100 million voted him by Congress as a Special War Fund.The statement, showing the expenditure of $20 million in Russia by Root’sSpecial War Mission to Russia, is also recorded in the Congressional Record,Sept. 2, 1919, as given by Wilson’s secretary,Joseph Tumulty.Wilson’s assistance was but the tip of the iceberg. Using Colonel RaymondRobins, head of a Red Cross Mission to Russia, as its emissary, J.P. Morgan &Co. sent several million dollars in cash to the Russians through Henry P.Davison, Morgan’s right-hand man.Now Wall Street’s financial manipulation takes on a larger meaning. Although theJapanese had appeared to make the most of the internal strife within Russiaduring 1905, it was U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt who mediated a peacetreaty that forced Russia to give upThe True Story of the Bii.derberg Groupits Eastern and Baltic fleets and cede the southern half of Sakhalin Island toJapan. The Russian monarchy further agreed to hand over Manchuria to Japan andto abandon protection of Korea, which Japan then annexed in 1910, to littleinternational objection.What American bankers backed with one hand, they took away with the other.Clearly, they wanted to reduce Russia’s sea power and trading ability, andinfluenced Roosevelt’s intercession in the negotiated settlement between Japanand Russia, but the outcome was staggering. This action by the Russian monarchyhad the effect of weakening Soviet naval strength in the Far East until wellafter World War II.Other avenues also provided secret funding on a supra-national level. One of thekey men involved was Dr. Parvus Helphand. In his 1931 book, Lenin: Red Dictator,Yale Professor George Vernadsky wrote, “In the autumn of 1915, the GermanRussian Social Democrat Parvus [Helphand], who had formerly been active in theRevolution of 1905, announced in the paper published by him in Berlin, DieGlocke [The Bell], his mission to serve as an intellectual link between thearmed German and the revolutionary Russian proletariat.... During the war.Parvus was engaged in furnishing supplies to the German army and in hugespeculations, and so considerable amounts of money passed through his hands.”German Imperial records that only came to light after World War II document theimportant role of this “Marxist millionaire” in funneling German funds torevolutionaries in Russia. In December of 1915, for example, the German StateSecretary telegraphed the Minister in Copenhagen: “Your Excellency is authorizedto pay one million rubles to Helphand.The following month the Minister submitteda report: “Dr. Helphand, who has returned to Copenhagen after spending threeweeks in Stockholm, where he conferred with Russian revolutionaries, has told methe following, in confidence: The sum of a million rubles which was put at hisdisposal, was immediately sent on, and has already reached Petrograd and beendevoted to the purposes for which it was intended.Now almost forgotten, the Russian Alexander Israel Helphand was an enigmaticcharacter whose career was as strange as anything served up in fiction. Hisactive role in the abortive Revolution of 1905, when he became a close associateof Trotsky, led to a Siberian exile, so necessary for the resume of any trueRussian revolutionary. He had taken theBolsheviks’ Benefactorsalias “Parvus” as a Socialist pamphleteer in Germany in 1894, having received in1891 a doctorate in philosophy From the University oF Basel in Switzerland,where he had deepened his Marxist convictions. Later, as Maxim Gorky’s Germanpublisher, he became involved in a scandal over royalties, the result of along-running dispute that led to a secret conviction and expulsion by the GermanSocialists.After a brief stay in Vienna, he traveled in 1910 to Istanbul, which became hisbase of operations. There he somehow made a large fortune. In January of 1915 headvised the German Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, For three months the alliesof Germany: “The interests of the German government were ... identical withthose of the Russian revolutionaries, who were already at work.”^^ This led tohis role as intermediary.Helphand had a part in arranging the notorious “sealed train,” which in April of1917 delivered Lenin and other Bolsheviks From exile in Switzerland throughGermany to a steamer bound For Sweden, whence they made their way throughFinland to Russia. As Vernadsky noted, Germany’s interest lay in both providingsafe passage and maintaining its secrecy: “To afford Lenin and his comrades anopportunity of passage to Russia was in the nature of introducing disease germsinto the organism of the Russian state.By the time the wily Lenin had reached Stockholm, however, he refused a meetingwith Parvus, who was awaiting him, and began to distance himself from thisentire episode. It clearly did not suit the Bolshevik program to be linked toRussia’s enemy while Russian soldiers were being slaughtered at the front.Helphand received his own entry in the first official Soviet Encyclopedia; bythe second he had vanished.^^Meanwhile, in New York Trotsky received word to return to Russia immediately.Conditions were now ripe for a Revolution. With $10,000 For “travelingexpenses,” he left New York on March 26, 1917, on the S.S. Kristicwiafjord,along with 275 Communist revolutionaries under the watchful eye of LincolnSteffens, an American Communist and John D. Rockefeller’s emissary, to make sureTrotsky was returned safely to Russia.Where did Trotsky get his passport? How was it arranged and why? It appears thatJohn D. Rockefeller himself obtained a special passport For Trotsky throughWoodrow Wilson, the President of the United States. Why would the President ofthe United States arrangeThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupfor passage of a known revolutionary merely at the request of a private, albeitwealthy, citizen?According to de-classified Canadian government archives, when the Kristiankfjordstopped in Halifax on April 13, 1917, Canadian Secret Service officers andBritish naval personnel immediately boarded the ship and removed Trotsky (underofficial instructions received from London via cablegram on March 29, 1917) andinterned him for questioning in Amherst, Nova Scotia.The cablegram described Trotsky as a German prisoner of war, and warned that hewas “on his way to take Russia out of the war, which would free many Germandivisions to attack the Canadian troops on the Western Front,” explains EustaceMullins in The World Order. A previous Canadian government memo stated thatTrotsky was carrying “10,000 dollars subscribed by socialists and Germans.Immediately, Prime Minister Lloyd George cabled orders from London to theCanadian Secret Service to set Trotsky free. His order was ignored. Finally,Mackenzie King — at this stage of his career he was a labor expert for John D.Rockefeller, Jr. — intervened, and obtained Trotsky’s release. As soon as he wasfreed. King sent Trotsky on his way to Russia to share leadership of theBolshevik Revolution with Lenin.For his efforts. King was rewarded with a S30,000-a-year salary as head of theRockefeller Foundation department of Industrial Research, at a time when theaverage wage in the United States was $500 per year. On the other hand, theagents who had arrested Trotsky were dismissed from the Canadian service.King, destined to become Prime Minister of Canada, has remained an enigma to hiscountrymen. Was he a fool, a genius, or a self-absorbed opportunist? Hisadmiration for Rockefeller was clearly, if not naively, stated in a note he sentat the time to his friend, Violet Markham. “John D. Rockefeller Jr., the truestfollower of Christ, has one purpose — to serve his fellow man.”While historiansJ.L. Granatstein and Norman Hillmer in 1999 ranked King as thegreatest of Canada’s Prime Ministers,*^^' this is the same man who “was exposedas a principal in the $30 million Beauharnais-Power Co. swindle during thebuilding of the St. Lawrence Seaway. [He] had accepted $700,000 from Beauharnaisfor the Liberal Party, and among other enticements had received a trip toBermuda.Bolsheviks’ BenefactorsOnce Lenin and Trotsky were back in Russia, and the revolution succeeded inoverthrowing the monarchy in 1918, a world headquarters for providing Bolshevikaid was consolidated at 120 Broadway on Wall Street:During the early 1920s, 120 Broadway not only housed Equitable Life, but alsothe Federal Reserve Bank of New York, whose directors were enthusiasticallysupporting the Bolsheviks; the American International Corporation, which hadbeen organized to aid the Soviet Union; Weinberg and Posner, which received a $3million order for machinery from the Soviet Union in 1919, and whose vicepresident was Ludwig Martens, first Soviet Ambassador to the U.S.; John McGregorGrant, whose operations were financed by Olaf Aschberg of Nya Banken, Stockholm,who had transmitted large sums furnished by the Warburgs for the BolshevikRevolution; the London agent of Nya Banken was the British Bank of NorthCommerce, whose chairman was Earl Grey, a close associate of Cecil Rliodes -Grant had been blacklisted by the U.S. Government for his support of Germanyduring World War 1; and on the top floor of 120 Broadway was the exclusiveBankers Club. These were the organizers of the World Order.*^^To add another ring to this dazzling mesh of intrigue, it is tempting to see alink from 120 Broadway through Nya Banken to the German support of theBolsheviks. Nya was the bank in Stockholm used by Parvus Helphand to funnelrubles and marks (often in gold) to Russian revolutionaries. As Helphandapparently destroyed all his personal records shortly before his death in 1924(in a Berlin mansion destined twelve years later to become the residence ofJosef Goebbels!), this nexus is likely to remain speculative.picture63 [images/picture63.jpg]John Sr., famously handing out a dimeL-R, John JrvTAbby SidricnTlaurence, John Sr., Winthrop, Abby \"Babs\" and DavidRockefeller^Grandpa John D. and Great Undef .William with little David RockefellerJ.P. Morgan around townpicture64 [images/picture64.jpg]picture65 [images/picture65.jpg]Chapter Twenty-ThreeTREASON FOR PROFITF rom the 1920s, Morgan-Rockefeller interests played a leading role in numerouspro-Soviet commercial arrangements. They controlled the principal firms doingbusiness with Soviet Russia: Vacuum Oil, International Harvester, Guaranty Trustand New York Life. In 1926, the Vacuum Oil Company, owned by Rockefeller, closedan agreement with the Soviet Naptha Syndicate to market Soviet oil in Europeancountries through the Chase National Bank (also Rockefeller-owned).At the time, it was reported that John D. Rockefeller agreed on a $75,000,000loan to the Bolsheviks as “part of the price for the arrangement.” As a resultof this deal. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil built an oil refinery in Russia in1927, after they were promised 50% of the Caucasus oil production.But, as early as 1911, John Moody had already nicknamed the Standard Oil Co. theStandard Oil Bank because, as he observed, the “Standard Oil Co. was really abank of the most gigantic character — a bank within an industry ... lending vastsums of money to needy borrowers just as other great banks were doing.”’^\"^Again, the Rockefellers played a key role in founding the American-RussianChamber of Commerce in 1922 to promote trade with Russia under the direction ofits chairman. Reeve Schley, who was vice president of Chase National Bank aswell.As a prerequisite to opening up the Russian market to the Establishment, in 1925John D. Rockefeller added pressure to theThe True Story of the Bilderberg GroupChamber’s lobbying for the U.S. government to change its foreign policy, througha private campaign under his press agent, Ivy Lee, “to sparkplug a publicrelations drive” and promote Communism in the U.S. This combined effortculminated in 1933 with the U.S. government’s recognition of Soviet Russia.In 1935, Stalin quietly repaid Rockefeller when he seized a sizable chunk ofassets owned by foreign companies investing in Russia, but did not touchStandard Oil properties.Through the 1920s and ’30s, lone U.S. Congressman Louis McFadden tracked thesecret financial manipulations of the Federal Reserve System for the benefit ofthe Soviet Union. By June 10, 1932, he was fed up with the deliberate drainageof U.S. funds to Russia and harangued the Fiouse: “Open up the books of Amtorg,the trading organization of the Soviet government in New York, and of Gostorg,the general office of the Soviet Trade Organization, and of the State Bank ofthe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and you will be staggered to see howmuch American money has been taken from the United States Treasury for thebenefit of Russia. Find out what business has been transacted for the State Bankof Soviet Russia by its correspondent, the Chase Bank of New York.”Years later, during World War II, Amtorg’s bank of choice to handle the billionsof dollars of Lend Lease transactions for Soviet Russia was, of course, theChase National Bank.Unfortunately, funneling U.S. taxpayers’ money to the Soviet Union was not aprofitable enough operation for the Wall Street gang of profiteers. They finallyengaged in treason for profit when they secretly began transferring the mostsophisticated and expensive American technology to the Soviets in 1943.*^^ Then,the Soviet Purchasing Commission requested from the U.S. government 200 poundsof uranium oxide, 220 pounds of uranium nitrate, and 25 pounds of uranium metal,commodities virtually unknown at that time, for their war efforts. On April 29,1943, the Board of Economic Warfare granted a special license to Chematar Corp.of New York to fill this order.This provided the Soviets with the resources to build their own atomic bomb (ifthey had the formula), while at the same time, Winston Churchill demanded fromPresident Roosevelt that Stalin be barred from sharing scientific intelligenceleading to the development of nuclear weapons before Britain or the U.S. hadproduced an atom bomb Erst. It was enough that the Allies were in a race withHitlerTreason for Profitto beat him at building atomic capabilities without worrying about another“madman” launching a nuclear threat on the world.While the rich became richer, Americans were told that a detente was necessary,because without bilateral agreements the enemy would attack. For the illusion ofa partnership among equals to become a reality, there must at least be the“semblance of parity among the senior member states before you can justify amerger.”^^^Is this why, according to hundreds of U.S. State Department documents, theSoviet industrial and military capabilities such as trucking, aircraft, oil,steel, petrochemicals, aluminum, and computers were constructed at the U.S.taxpayers’ expense in the Soviet Union? For the sake of parity?As Sutton pointed out in 1972, “There was no such thing as Soviet technology.”^^^Of the technology that did exist, almost 90 to 95% came directly or indirectlyfrom the United States and its Allies. “Even stranger,” commented Sutton intestimony he gave to the Subcommittee of the Platform Committee of theRepublican Party, “the U.S. apparently wants to make sure this enemy remains inthe business of being an enemy.”The Soviets’ merchant marine, for example, was the largest in the world,containing nearly 6,000 vessels. But, Sutton further testified, “Abouttwo-thirds of the vessels were built outside the Soviet Union. About four-fifthsof the engines for these ships were also built outside the Soviet Union.“All Soviet automobile, truck, [guns, tanks, aircraft] and engine T<^hnologycome from the West. The Gorki organization, built by the Ford and Austincompanies, produced most of the trucks that once carried Soviet-suppliedmilitary equipment down the Ho Chi Minh Trail [during the Viet Nam War).Automobile factories can also be used to build tanks. The same Gorkiorganization under the guise of ‘peaceful trade,’ produced in 1964 the firstSoviet wire-guided anti-tank system. The Soviets have the largest iron and steelplant in the world. It was built by McKee Corporation. It is a copy of the U.S.steel plant in Indiana.How many billions did the United States spend on defense against a phantom enemyit created, nurtured, supported and built up? Do the costs justify the means? Ofcourse, they do! Remember, the Great Merger will be controlled by the sameBilderberg-CFR-TC combines thatThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupare orchestrating behind-the-scenes regional blocks and temporary monetaryunions.Chapter Twenty-FourSACRIFICING A NATIONW hile many biographies, including David Rockefeller’s autobiography, Memoirs,describe the Rockefellers’ unlimited economic and political power, and thefamily’s fabulous wealth, as spent on feeding the starving in Third Worldcountries, educating the poor through myriad benevolent foundations andsocieties, and building the infrastructure of underdeveloped and war-ravagednations, few have dealt with what many believe to be the most remarkable aspectof the family — its single-minded intent to destroy the United States as anindependent nation, to establish, for the greater good, a New World Order.Without a justifiable and a visible enemy, no nation will voluntarily give upits individual rights and freedoms. The Bilderberg, CFR and Trilateral brethrenknow they have to produce a reason for people to “buy into” their One WorldPlan. Every day their rhetoric grows louder.The Web site of the Trilateral Commission, for instance, speaks boldly of“sharing leadership responsibilities,” and advocates “closer cooperation” and“mutual understanding.” How they understand these terms, however, varies greatlyfrom how the greater part of the population understands them.By the time Brzezinski, Cyrus Vance, Defense Secretary Harold Brown andUndersecretary of the Treasury Anthony Solomon came together to help found theTrilateral Commission, they were already actively participating in a parallelinitiative promoted by the CPR called the “1980s Project”: “the largest singleeffort in CFR’s history.” The aimThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupof the project was to see “how world trends might be steered toward a particulardesirable future outcome.”This desirable future outcome dealt with the utter disintegration of theeconomy. In Alternatives to Monetary Disorder, Fred Hirsch, at the time editorof the London Economist, explained how this would be done:A degree of controlled disintegration in the world economy is a legitimateobjective for the 1980s and may be the most realistic one for a moderateinternational economic order. A central normative problem for the internationaleconomic order in the years ahead is how to ensure that the disintegrationindeed occurs in a controlled way and does not rather spiral into damagingrestrictionism. The problem therefore is not to minimize politicization in theprocess sense of political intervention in market outcomes; it is rather tocreate a framework capable of containing the increased level ot suchpoliticization that emerges naturally from the changed balance in both domesticeconomies and the international system.Translation; the key political commitment is to impede at all costs thereemergence of economic nationalism in all of its manifestations — industrial,technological and scientific.Why would Rockefeller and other U.S. Trilateralists, Bilderbergers and the CFRmembers want to dismantle the industrial might of the United States? Tounderstand the reasons, we must briefly review the economic history of thetwentieth century.The British Empire began to lose its grip on industrial superiority in the lasttwo decades of the nineteenth century. As the British power began to wane, theUnited States, Japan, France and Germany overtook it in industrial production.Mow was it that a nation such as France, almost ruined under the reign ofNapoleon III, could build itself up in such a short period of time? It wassimple. Their economic policies were based upon a “decidedly anti-liberaleconomic theory, the theory of dirigisme, identified with the theoretical worksof Alexander Hamilton, and also with the works of the great American economistsHenry and Mathew Carey.”'japan’s economic miracle was due to its adherence to the principles of theJanuary 3, 1868 Meiji Revolution, which brought about significant reforms to theJapanese society in terms of compulsory universal education, mass modernizationand the encouragement of capitalismSacrificing a Nationand markets in the tradition of American economists. The reforms of the MeijiRevolution shaped the basis of the modernization of pre-World War II Japaneseindustry, and also the makings and experience for the post-WWII “Japanesemiracle.”Germany too was built up into a leading world industrial power because itfollowed the policies of the great German economist Friedrich List, who waslargely influenced by Hamilton’s economic principles and the American school ofpolitical economy. In the nineteenth century. List was very much against theBritish model of free trade: buying cheap and selling expensive.The British oligarchy was well aware that, to survive, it needed to destroyHamilton’s “American System” of developmental economic nationalism, which wasintended to allow the United States to become economically independent andnationally self-sufficient by imposing industry protection through (a) selectivehigh tariffs to keep out British manufactured goods, (b) government investmentsin infrastructure to create targeted internal improvements, and (c) a nationalbank with policies to promote the growth of productive enterprises.In the early 1950s, Anglo-American leadership faced their first real challengefrom the then-Western Alliance partners, as the post-WWII liberal economicsystem was discernibly going to pieces. France, the Federal Republic of Germany,as well as American nationalist forces were proposing a new orientation in favorof a commitment for renewed industrial development worldwide. “Such a policywould have meant industrialization of key sectors of the Third World and thusthe eventual emergence of new, sound, and strong nations — a repeat of theBritish nightmare at the turn of the 20'*' century. Such a policy would alsohave meant that France, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Japan, with theirspecial relations with Third World nations, would experience an industrial boom,as their economies mobilized to provide the capital goods needed by the newnations. In the beginning of 1973, the West German deutschmark had alreadysmashed the British pound and by July-August was on its way to gaining hegemonyover the ailing U.S. dollar.”'\"Economic development would have also meant future competition from up-and-comingnations: competition, which needless to say, had to be strangled in the cradle.From the Establishment’s point of view, there is a clear advantage to conductingbusiness in this manner. “First,The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupeconomic exchanges [with weaker nations] can always be used as a tool ofpolitical power through boycotts, bribery, and manipulation of trade incentives.Second, economic relationships can operate on a more fundamental level, shapingthe political economic foundations of a weaker, less developed economy throughthe opportunity offered to it in the form of trade and finance. The weakercountry in the economic relationship, like a weaker class, then becomes not justa group of assorted individuals but a particularized, isolated and dependentparticipant in the world economy.”'*^British surrogates were launched in the United States in an attempt to destroyHamilton’s “American System” of economic nationalism — the Ditchley Foundationand the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies in Colorado. The institute wasfounded by Lord Bullock of the Royal Institute of International Affairs [RIIA].The RIIA is a branch of the Round Table, whose American branch is the Council onForeign Relations.The Aspen Institute played a leading role in the Malvinas War between Argentinaand Britain, as noted in Part One. Latin America is important to the UnitedStates because it has the potential to provide a huge market for Americanexports of technology and heavy industrial equipment, which could galvanize manyof America’s faltering companies and provide thousands of new jobs. In theBilderberg/CFR/TC “post industrial” age, this has to be prevented at all costs.One of the stranger propositions coming out of the Ditchley Foundation was itspublic advocacy for dual citizenship for England and the United States, ashocker to the U.S. constitutional experts, as the English do not possess thelegal status of “citizens,” but that of “subjects.”Aspen and Ditchley do not represent themselves, but rather form part of a vastoverlapping systemic organization with the Bilderbergers, CFR andTrilateralists, all playing a different function in their long-range objectivesof shaping a community of developed nations. As David Rockefeller said in hisMemoirs, “Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against thebest interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as‘internationalists’ and of conspiring with others around the world to build amore integrated global political and economic structure — one world, if youwill. If that’s the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it.”Sacrificing a NationWhat we have witnessed from this “cabal” is the gradual collapsing of the U.S,economy that began in the 1980s.The corporate raiders, financed by the dirty-money junk bond networks, bought upsignificant chunks of corporate America, and terrified the rest. The raiders’targets, and those who feared they might become targets, turned to Wall Street’sinvestment banks and law firms for “protection.” As such, the leveragedbuy-out/junk bond operation functioned as a giant protection racket, destroyingsome as a way of collecting tribute from the rest. At the same time, dirty moneypoured into the real estate market, notably through the giant Canadiandevelopers.... These firms built the skyscrapers, which were then filled up withservice workers — bankers, lawyers, accountants, clerks, and other white-collartypes....The pouring of hot money into the real estate markets caused real estate pricesto rise. The “wealth” created by these rising values provided more money to pumpinto the bubble....The speculator went from being the enemy to being the role model....The old-style productive industry became the realm of “losers,” replaced by thehot new “industries” of Hnance and information....The effect of all this deregulation and speculation has been the decimation ofthe physical economy of the United States. Over the last three decades, theproductive capacity of the U.S. economy has been cut in half, measured in termsof market baskets of goods on a per-capita, per-household, andper-square-kilometer basis. At the same time, the monetary claims on thatdeclining production have risen hyperbolically.\"^As a result, the rich have grown richer, and the poor, poorer, while the middleclass has continued to shrink. This is the price the interconnectedorganizations of “international insiders” have exacted behind our backs. Theyhave sacrificed our dreams, our independence and our self-sufficiency at thealtar of their New World Order.Richard N. Cooper, a Trilateralist and one of the authors of a 1977 Task ForceReport entitled. Toward a Renovated International System, defined theCommission’s objectives for world control: “The support for human rights willhave to be balanced against other important goals of world order. SomeTrilateral conceptions of detente with the Soviet Union and other Communiststates tend to conflict with a policy of promoting human rights.”The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupIs this the sound of dissent? One member calling for balance in the TrilateralCommission’s goals, implying there is a lack of balance in the Commission’sactual implementation of its plans.As much as we may wish for dissent to develop within Rockefeller’s TrilateralCommission, we will never see it implode and fall in upon its own foundation. AsEustace Mullins explains, “The Rockefellers operate under clearly definedspheres of influence. The ‘charitable’ organizations, the business companies,and the policy groups always meld into a working operation. No department of theGroup can strike out on its own or formulate an independent policy, no matterwhat may be its justification, because it operates under the control of theworld financial structure, which means that on any given day, all of its assetscould be rendered close to worthless by adroit financial manipulation. This isthe final control, which ensures that no one can quit the organization. Not onlywould he be stripped of all assets, but he would be under contract for immediateassassination.So, how can any one person stand up to such a mammoth machine, which, like anoctopus, grows larger, bolder and more powerful as its tentacles reach out andstrangle everything and everyone in its path?Our political, military and financial leaders are still accountable for theiractions. Make your vote count. Bring back Abe Lincoln’s original democracy: agovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people. The one thing thisself-appointed “cabal” of financial aristocrats is most afraid of is a publicrevolt, because they have been the masterminds behind one of the mostdevastating revolutions in history. But, not all revolutions have to be violent.There is tremendous power in everyone saying “NO” in a quiet yet firm,collective voice.What Edwin H. Chapin said in the nineteenth century remains true today: “Notarmies, not nations, have advanced the race; but here and there, in the courseof ages, an individual has stood up and cast his shadow over the world.”Chapter Twenty-FiveDETENTION, 2004F or once, my mind wasn’t on the Bilderbergers. Nor was it on the sleepy resorttown of Stresa in Italy, where they planned to meet this year. Instead, as Imade my way through Milan’s Malpensa International Airport, my thoughts werebusy seeking meaning in my past. Was it a storehouse of remembered images andconcealed patterns that contain the key to the mysterious designs on my life?What if I never discovered that key? What would become of me?“Bi/ona sera. Would you please come with us, sir?”The sharp voice penetrated my ponderings. I looked up. A man, dressed in araincoat, approached me. The raincoat struck me as odd. Through the wall ofwindows lining the airport terminal, I could see the Mediterranean blue sky. Nocloud in sight. And then I spotted the shiny automatic weapon slung across hisshoulders under his coat.Butterflies fluttered in my stomach. Feelings of prearranged tragedy, or moreprecisely, the ever-present shadow I lived with, reminded me of the perilousways in which I chose to make my living.The man in the raincoat stopped directly in front of me, clicked his heels andtipped his index and middle fingers to his temple in salute. Flashes of TweedleDum and Tweedle Dee sprung to mind from the prior year’s experience inVersailles.He introduced himself as a detective. ‘‘Would you please come with us?” he askedagain.Flanked by two local guards and a narcotics officer with a Doberman, thedetective and 1 passed into a detention room where small-time hoodlums andbig-time criminals were usually questionedThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupand searched. The room was so tiny it scarcely accommodated the wide deskdominating the space. Adding to this impression of absurd imbalance was the lowtable standing next to it. A small desk lamp sat on top. Once we were allcrowded inside, including the Doberman, the detective closed the door.In the eerie quiet, I could hear the wind outside brush the window glass, whileinside, through the room’s thin walls, I could make out someone weeping nextdoor followed by rhythmic whimpering. And then, my attention was caught by heavyfootsteps across the hallway.“You may take off your coat,” said one of the guards, jerking his head in thedirection of a tall coat rack standing in the corner.Looking back, I am ashamed to recall the anxiety I felt as I mechanicallyunzipped my windbreaker. Straining to reach up, I slung my windbreaker over thetop hook, but it fell short, taking down two other coats and a plaid jacket withit. The four garments swished to the floor. I debated picking them up and thendecided to leave the pile on the floor. I leaned against the wall and faced myinterrogators, determined to keep my cool yet aware of the sweat greasing theback of my neck.Lei come si chianu} (What is your name?)I gave him my name.“What is your nationality?”“Canadian.”Di che parte di Canada e lei? (What part of Canada are you from?) Lei doveabita? (Where do you live?) Qiial e il suo nuinero di telefono? (What is yourtelephone number?) Ela prima volta che viene in Italia? (Is this your firstvisit to Italy?)I gave them straight answers. Years of covering the Bilderberg Group taught methis was the easiest way to avoid confrontations with bullish border guards andtrigger-happy policemen. I had seen other journalists turned back at the borderfor their impudence.“We would like to examine your suitcase. We have reason to believe you may betransporting drugs,” said the detective.Drugs! The accusation stunned me.“If you have drugs, you better tell us before we open up your bag,” added thenarcotics officer.Being accused of carrying illegal drugs would not normally scare me — 1 don’tuse drugs, much less transport them internationally in asuitcase — but my name is known internationally by all divisions of the secretservice, from Mossad to the KGB, MI6, the FBI, and the CIA. Each reportercovering an annual Bilderberg meeting is photographed, his personal detailstaken and the information passed through Interpol to all internationalprotection agencies. Could someone have slipped drugs into my suitcase?I had only brought what luggage I could carry. No check-ins so I could keep mybag with me. I wracked my brain. Was there a moment when I left it unguarded? Nomatter how I tried to contain my nervousness, I failed to find one crumb ofhope. The best scenario I could look forward to was to be put back on the planeand sent home. “Bilderberg Paradise Lost” would be the headline in mynewspaper’s next issue.One of the guards lifted my suitcase and placed it on the wide desk. He openedit with his back to me. All I could see were the sharp angles of his elbowsmoving to and fro as he rummaged through my things. Suddenly he looked up, gavea cry, and pulled out a thin, well-worn volume of poetry by Afanasii Fet from mybag. Fet, an impressionist Russian writer of the late nineteenth century, couldwrite a verse using only nouns yet create a sense of restiveness that utterlyamazed me. This book represented the essence of my Russian soul, and I nervouslywatched the guard rifle through the dog-eared pages printed in Russian. As if oncue, everyone in the room started talking at once.The other bespectacled guard grabbed the book from him and immediatelyproclaimed he had been to Russia and knew some Russian words. ''Borsch (beetsoup),” he said to me proudly, followed by raduga (rainbow) and privet (hello).With his limited vocabulary, he then tried to form a coherent sentence. Ilistened dutifully, with half-opened mouth: his knowledge of Russian reminded meof the vastness of a stepa [steppes], that island of hope amongst the enormityof emptiness. Just listening to his bastardizing my native language wasdifficult enough, but trying to make sense out of what he was saying becamesheer torture.The detective sat down on the bench beside me, where I was still standingagainst the wall. He popped a peppermint into his mouth and then took my volumeof Fet from the guard. He passed his fingers across the spine before he openedthe book and leafed through its pages. His head moved in rhythm with his lips ashe tried to follow the191The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupwords across one page. Then the book lost his interest, and he laid it on thebench beside him, forgotten. He was an embarrassing representative for anyairport security: none too young, with a sharp-tipped nose, sleekly parted hair,jutting eyelids and badly bitten fingernails.In the next room, someone roared with laughter. Across the hall, a chairviolently slid across the floor. Suddenly, our door burst open. Aplainsclothesman with a holster slung over his shoulder stepped inside. Hecarried a red folder in his left hand. Recognizing the detective, he bellowed indelight, and his right hand spread open, all five fingers dancing. The detectivegrabbed the other man’s free hand and zealously slapped his back. The plainclothes operator whispered something to the detective, and they turned theirbacks to me, while they talked in hushed voices. They motioned to the two guardsand the narcotics officer, and all of them huddled together. In spite of theirattempts to whisper, I could make out isolated phrases in Italian: Cosa vuoldire} (What do you mean?). Non capisco nulla. (I don’t understand anything!),Che cerca? (What is he looking for?)Some agreement formed, for they all stopped talking at once. The detectiveturned, stood and walked towards me. He braced himself in front. We were eyeballto eyeball. The guards took their place at the door, the narcotics cop sat onthe edge of the desk, and the plain clothes operator leaned against the oppositewall. Through all their switches of position, the Doberman remained asleep onthe mat.“Let me see, where do I know you from?”Completely out of character, the detective had switched to using a velvet tone,but his D-grade acting performance only made him less threatening and morelaughable. 1 resisted the urge to smile. After an hour of this endlessinterrogation, our routine had become rote, and I was beginning to find bizarrehumor in the situation.He began with the same questions again. Dove siete alloggiati} (Where are youstaying?)But, this time he asked me for my plane tickets and hotel reservation. Iproduced both, crumpled beyond recognition in the habitual chaos of my satchel.“What possible reason would you have to come to Stresa at this time of theyear?”I said nothing. I bent down to retrieve my Fet volume, lying forgotten on thebench.“Never mind the book,” instructed the detective.I obeyed mid-motion and resumed standing erect.The detective produced a photograph out of the red folder he was now holding inhis right hand. I could hardly believe it. Staring at me was a copy of my ownhideous black-and-white Spanish national identity photograph.“What business do you have to attend to in Stresa?” he repeated in perfectEnglish.There could be no mistake about it. Someone in the Spanish Ministry of theInterior had provided the Italian security forces with my photo. The Italiansknew why I had flown into Milan and were waiting for me. What’s worse, theSpanish Ministry of the Interior had to be cooperating with the Bilderbergers tostop my investigation. I stared intently at a piece of tinfoil sparkling on thefloor as thoughts scrambled through my mind.All at once, the pieces of the puzzle slid into place. I understood something Ihad been seeing without understanding — why airport security had stopped me, whythey questioned me, why they made me lose time. They couldn’t retain me, for Ihad done nothing; nor did they want to let me go, for they were told to keep meat bay. The simple solution leapt to mind. The next move was mine, and if I madeit right, I was a free man.“Gentlemen,” I said, “you have two choices. Either you arrest me and charge mewith a crime, or you let me go. The masquerade is over. You know why I am here,and I know that you know that I know your game plan.”Another brief consultation ensued amongst the five of them. I waited and focusedon the shadow left by the slip of tinfoil still lying on the floor. Sick of itall, angry at them, at me, at the world, for not knowing, not wanting to knowand not caring about the Bilderbergers, I saw in the insignificant shape of theshadow the orderly existence of the moment.1 also knew that, within minutes. I’d be driven by taxi to the shores of LakeMaggiori, to Stresa and to the Bilderberg Group’s annual conference; to areunion with a group of fearless journalists, my friends, all of whom againstall odds made their way to this sleepy little town; people like me who put upwith unimaginable hardships to expose the Bilderberger’s master plan for GlobalGovernment and One World Order.193The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupSo, what is “time” — I asked myself in the taxi, once more escaping into mythoughts — if not mere brutal passage and decay? A form of awareness? A birth ofconsciousness? And yet, even less do I understand why Fate brings theBilderbergers and me constantly together, why I need to write about them.To write, I once read, is not to be absent but to become absent; to be someoneand then go away, leaving traces. And those traces, I finally realized, add upto our past.I tried to concentrate on what was awaiting me in Stresa. Twenty-two-hourworking days, phone calls to check information from sources, continualharassment by the secret service, threats, unauthorized searches, meetings andmore meetings with those few valiant souls who brave the threats ofBilderbergers to give us precious details of their diabolical plans. But, Isimply couldn’t get my mind around it.Incoherent images danced in my head. Total Enslavement. Manmade famines thatswept millions to their grave. Suffering, more suffering. Unspeakable, inhumansacrifice. Why? Is it really possible that someone might want to inflict so muchpain on the world for personal gain? As I struggled to hold back tears, I keptreminding myself that my quest for the truth was a vindication of decency at theexpense of greed and power.I kept mulling over happy endings to the yet-to-be-written tale about paradiselost: our damage-strewn world. What would it mean to lose happiness forever?Paradise and its loss are integral to each other. Not only that true paradisesare lost paradises, but that there are also no paradises without loss — it isn’tparadise if you can’t lose it.Bilderberg, of course, has become a metaphor for fear. Beneath its insanity,there is an understanding that time and space, like love and death, alter us andaffirm us, cling to us and explore us. They include the irrevocable, and make uswho we are.picture66 [images/picture66.jpg]picture67 [images/picture67.jpg]picture68 [images/picture68.jpg]The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupBehind the Closed Door; In Documents and Picturest,DE BILDRRBERG’ CONFERENCEAT OOSTERBEEKNEAR ARNHEMO29th. 30ch. 31st May 19541Top: Cover page of the program for the very first Bilderberg conference held atOosterbeek, the Netherlands.Bottom: Official 1954 Bilderberg badge for Bilderberg staff.picture69 [images/picture69.jpg]The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupTHE WHITE HOUSEWASH INGTONMarch 11, 1955.MEMORANDUM FOR GABRIEL HAUGEI understand that next week Prince Bernhard is having a meeting at Barbizon,continuing his exploration looking toward improving European and Americanrelations.If personally you can fit such a trip into your schedule, I suggest you find themoney and go to France.picture70 [images/picture70.jpg]D.D.E.I U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower urges his assistant Gabriel Hauge to attendthe i 1955 Bilderberg conference in Barbizon, France.

The names of the participants are not made known. The conference willend Monday afternoon.In silenceThe choice had fallen on \"The Biiderberg\" because the site of this hotel wasparticularly suitable. We were seeking a hotel of standing and atmosphere, wheretop figures of international diplomacy and business would feel at home. But italso had to be a bit isolated. Hence not along a main road, near a big city orat a lake, where numerous journalists, photographers or news reel personnelcould intrude and take pictures.Because the necessary condition for the success of the conference was:seclusion. And the Biiderberg offered this f seclusion. One can only reach thehotel from the main road to Arnhem through an entrance gate at the start of analley. If we could hire the entire estate for a few days and print individualentrance tickets, only a few guards could control the whole undertaking.Why then this secrecy? What was the aim, what were they cooking?Nothing that could not bear the light of day, but neither anything that could bespoiled or would lead to endless chain-reactions if the light of day would shineon it.199The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupBIXJjRPBERG:;ROTrpnXLAHG-B'D STEERING COMMITTEE J'/CEETIwl:-De Bllderber-g Fniel OosTorbee'-s:•- 26 vb l\\pv\\'\\ . 1 9f‘3 X ii st of Part j c:i pci nisHoHoKo.

Some things in this report are certainly worth mentioning. Forexample, the report shows that the Bilderbergers were well aware back in 1973 ofthe near-future oil crisis. On page 55, there is talk of manipulating energymarkets for personal gain. During Bilderberg 1973, Bilderbergers openlydiscussed (p.63 of the reporO increasing oil from the May 1973 price of$3/barrel to somewhere in the range of $10-12.50/ barrel. Miraculously, some 6months later oil went up to $11.65/barrel. On page 66 of the report, it wasproposed for the Group to work toward an international federal reserve system.Curiously, Europe IS now an embodiment of this system, with North America nottoo far behind. And if that wasn't enough, a French speaker, on page 69 of thereport, proposed the creation of an international clearing house to channel hotmoney from oil revenues. Is it any wonder the Bilderbergers would much prefer tokeep their discussions secret?The complete report is available at www.BilderberQBook.comBehind the Closed Door.- In Documents and PicturesCONrKNTSLIST OF PARTICIPANTS 5INTRODUCTION 9FIRST ITEM OF THE AGENDA\"The Possibilities of the Development of a European Energy Policy, and theConsequences for European-North American Relations.\"Summary of and Introduction to the International Working Paper . , 13Summary of and Introduction to the American Working Paper .... 22Discussion 35SECOND ITEM OF THE AGENDA\"Conflicting Expectations Concerning the European Security Conference.\"Summary' of and Introduction to the Norwegian Working Paper ... 73Summary of and Introduction to the .American Working Pa|>er . ... 818oLIST OF PARTlClFA.N’i SCHAlRMfXN:H.R.H.

The Prince of the Netherlands.There were 80 participants, drawn from a variety of fields: government ancpolitics, universities, journalism, diplomac>', industry, transport, tradeunions the law, banking, foundation administration and military service. Theycam< from thirteen Western European countries, the United States, Canada ancvarious international organizations.In accordance with the rulers adopted at each Meeting, all participants spok< ina purely personal capacity without in any way committing whatever government ororganization to which they might belong. To enable participants U ;pcak with thegreatest possible frankness, the discussions were confidentia with fio reportersbeing admitted.The j^enda was as follows:I. The Possibilities of the Development of a European Energy Policy, and theConsequences for European-North American Relations.II. Conflicting Expectations Concerning the European Security Conference.At the opening of the meeting, H.R.H. The Prince of the Netherlands read atelegram of thanks and good wishes which he had sent to H.M. Gustav VI Adolf andthe reply which he had received from the latter.His Royal Highness expressed hLs regret at the absence of Professor JohrPesmazoglou, whose request for p>ermission to leave Greece had been denied andof Mr. Gerhard Schrbder of West Germany, whose political commitment hadprevented him at the last moment from attending.After recalling the Bilderberg rules of procedure, The Prince turned to th<first item of the Agenda.Behind the Closed Door; In Documents and PicturesTHE POSSIBILITIES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A EUROPEAN ENERGY POLICY, AND THECONSEQUENCES FOR EUROPKAN-NORTH AMERICANRELATIONSThe background for discussion of this topic consisted of two working papers -one written by an International participant, the other by an Americanparticipant - which had been distributed before the meeting. 'Fhese papers, indthe comments of their authors in introducing them to the meeting, are lummarizcdbelow.GUIDELINES FOR A EUROPEAN ENERGY POLICY AND ITS CONSEQUENCES ON RELATIONSBETWEEN EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICAThe International author of this working papier began by pointing out that iherewas fairly widespread agreement as to why the energy situation was ilarming. Therelevant figures were generally known, and diagnoses of the inergy trenddiffered little. The problem was what treatment to apply: we aeeded an effort ofimagination to avoid lapsing into fatalism, and a strong tense of realism toguard against a Utopian approach.In this spirit, he proposed to examine the guidelines of a common energy xilicyfor the European Community, and then to consider how the main :nergy-consumingcountries might cooperate with one another.[. The Commumty energy potuy. Mapping out a Community energy policy was aong-term task. So far it had produced a limited number of specific measures, >uta new impetus was called for now, inspired by an overall vision.A. Gradual materialization of the Community energy polieySince the ECSC and Euratom treaties had dealt sjKcifically with coal andI 'XExcerpts from the 1973 report:However, the development of the oil resources of the Middle East did not reflectany extensive industrial involvement of the economics of those countries or anyimportant contribution by their j>eoplc to the huge flow of oil outward and ofrevenue backward. Operations were limited fundamentally to a small enclave.These various issues added up to a political crisis, not an oil crisis, in theview of a British participant. Middle Eastern countries had taken overquantities of oil contrary, to their agreements, with iw<* im{K>riaiitspractical consequences. First, there wils no limit to the price increases, andto the resulting impact on the balance of payments of consuming countries.Second, there was no particular incentive for the prorlucing countries todevelop the additional oil wells which would be needed if the civilized worldwere to continue using energy at the rate predicted. With a rising value totheir asset, it was in their interest to leave it in the ground, regardless ofworld shortages. Producing countries would thus be able to determine thestandard of living of consuming countries, and to enforce their political willupon them. It was not just a question of price (as an .'\\mcrican participant hadsuggested) but of quantity. A French speaker agreed with this anaK'sls.'Fhe announcement of Libya’s price demands, which had been made just as thismeeting convened, happened to furnish an excellent illustration of the sort ofproblem hreed by the oil companies. rhalcountrywMsrcsponsiblcfor one-sixth ofEurope’s oil supplies, so that one’s access to a daily hot bath depended verymuch on the attitude of (Colonel Q^iulhafi, iis the British speaker put it.If-* f •••• • «sovcrcign-to-sovcreign negotiations. The speaker replied that, at some point,the developed world would have to ’ ’take unusual step s” to protect its supplyof energy, in order to avid widespread unemployment and social unresf? Economicboycotts or shut-ins would obviously be against the interest of the worldcommunity, to which the producing countries had a definite respon-sibility.Whatever mcicsures might be cnvis.iged, sovereign governments could present amore convincing front tftan private entities.A Belgian intcrvenuon emphasized the need for a “psycho-social and political\"reorientation of our values, to enable an cflicicnt network of public transport^to replace our absurd system’* of urban transportation by private*^ automobiles,with its attendant problems of parking, road congestion and air po ution. . tough this reorientation would not completely solve the energyprob em, even a marginal reduction in demand would lie welcome in the supplycrisis which lay ahead.An American speaker pointed out that one oflicial US estimate of the futuredelivered price had been as high as S5 a barrel - which was now perhaps on thelow side - but that certain cost factors would reduce the net return to theproducing countries by around $1. Two other American participants reported thatthe author of the estimate just referred to - Mr. James Akins - hadsubsecpicntly said that the $5 figure would prove to be too low. and mightindeed range up to $10-12.50 a barrel.Behind the Closed Door: In Documents and PicturesBILDERBERG MEETINGS1, SmKi»waccr, 2500 GK Gr;ivrnhagr P.O.

Kenneth Clarke, QC, MPpicture87 [images/picture87.jpg]HOUSE OF COMMONSLONDON SWIA OAA24'^ March, 2003Dear Mr. Martin,Thank you very much for your recent letter. This year's Bilderberg Meeting isbeing held at Versailles in France, but I am afraid it is not open to thepublic. The whole point of the meetings is that they are informal and relaxedexchanges of views between politicians and businessmen, who can talk to eachother without being on the record or reported publicly. Some of the people arevery well known and, if they were talking in public, they would have to speak inthe language of a press release, which does inhibit the flow of argument.Yours sincerely.Official reply from the office of Honourable Kenneth Clarke, member of BritishParliament, to a request for information from a citizen concerned about Mr.Clarke's Bilderberg attendance. The text of theletter is identical to every reply on the record from every Bilderberg attendeeregarding attendance at the conference.Mr. F. M.

TheConference will deal mainly with European-Americon relations, Energy, Russia,Iran, the Middle East, Asia, Terrorism, and Immigration.Approximately 130 participants will attend of whom about two-thirds come fromEurope and the balance from North America. About one-third is from governmentand politics, and two-thirds are from finance, industry, labor, education, andcommunications. The meeting is private in order to encourage franjc and opendiscussion.Bilderberg takes its name from the hotel in Holland, where the first meetingtook plaee in May 1954, That pioneering meeting grew out of the concernexpressed by leading citizens on both sides of the Atlantic that Western Europeand North America were not working together as closely as they should on commonproblems of critical importance. It was felt that regular, off-thc-recorddiscussions would help create a better understanding of the complex forces andmajor trends affecting Western nations in the difficult post-war period.The Cold W'ar has now ended. But in practically all respects there are more, notfewer, common problems - from trade to jobs, from monetary policy to investment,from ecological challenges to the task of promoting international security. Itis hard to think of any major issue in either Europe or North America whoseunilateral solution would not have repercussions for the other.Thus the concept of a European-Amcrican forum has not been overtaken by time.The dialogue between these two regions is sbll - even increasingly - critical.What is unique about Bilderberg as a forum is the broad cross-section of leadingcitizens that are assembled for nearly three days of informal and off-the-recorddiscussion about topics of current concern especially in the fields of foreignaffairs and the international economy; the strong feeling among participantsthat in view of the differing altimdes and experiences of the Western nations,there remains a clear need to further develop an understanding in which theseconcerns can be accommodated; the privacy of the meetings, which has no purposeother than to allow participants to speak their minds openly and freely.In short, Bilderberg is a small, flexible, informal and off-the-recordinternational forum in which different viewpoints can be expressed and mutualunderstanding cnlianccd.Bilderberg's only activity is its annual Conference. At the meetings, noresolutions arc proposed, no votes taken, and no policy statements issued Since1954, fifty-three conferences have been held. 3 he names of the participants aremade available to the press. Participants are chosen for theirexperience, their knowledge, and their standing; all participants attendBilderberg in a private and not an official capacity.Participants have agreed not to give interviews to the press during the meeting.In contacts with the news media after the conference it is an established rulethat no attribution should be made to individual participants of what wasdiscussed during the meeting.There will be no press conference. A list of participants is appended.226Bilderberg press release along with the complete list of 2006 attendees wasfaxed to us from the hotel by one of our sources.Behind the Closed Door; In Documents and Picturespicture102 [images/picture102.jpg]MirJYnTKTBrookstreet Hotel® 003/006The True Story of the Bilderberg Group06/09/2(11)6 FRI 11:J0 FAX 6132\"11850 Brookstreet Hoteli004/00608/06/20062Behind the Closed Door: In Documents and Picturespicture103 [images/picture103.jpg]P06/00608 / 06/2006The True Story of the Bilderberg Grouppicture104 [images/picture104.jpg]WORLD CUP:GAME ON!Despite the scandals, the fans are ready, sports. bi Why Germany won’t win.BUSINESS, Elpicture105 [images/picture105.jpg]picture106 [images/picture106.jpg]How to Cl graffiti: Don’t seii spray paii to teens.COY, FIWORLD’S ELITE SLIP INTO TOWN FOR SECRET MEETINGpicture107 [images/picture107.jpg]picture108 [images/picture108.jpg]picture109 [images/picture109.jpg]cv«u<«c r>*coftMMaTt»N-niBmciTmH»d« .Uf^.n©mb*reb#gjn*rrMn*y#»Urd«ylofthelfm#6Mn£otti>*aroofc»»»-«»u^^i -fro*., to** Ift: U S b-n;<.r D»kl Rockefeller, ol the fwwwi.

Canada has already complied with its own law. In 1995, the Canadian federalgovernment passed the Firearms Act requiring Canada’s 7 million rifles to beregistered by 2004. According to their 2003 report, 6,818,073 non-restrictedhrearms, restricted and prohibited firearms had been registered with theCanadian government. Failure to comply is seen as a serious criminal offense.Many Canadians and Americans see this as the prelude to later wholesale gunconfiscation.41. Roe V.

The 1992 CFR annual Report contains the following representative sample:Page 21: “At all meetings, the Council’s rule of non-attribution applies. Thisassures participants that they may speak openly without others later attributingtheir statements to them in public media or forums, or knowingly transmittingthem to persons who will.”Page 122: Like the Council, the Committees encourage candid discourse by holdingtheir meetings on a not-for-attribution basis.”Page 169: Article 11 of the by-laws states: “It is an express condition ofmembership in the Council, to which condition every member accedes by virtue ofhis or her membership, that members will observe such rules, and regulations asmay be prescribed from time to time by the Board of Directors concerning theconduct of Council meetings or the attribution of statements made therein, andthat any disclosure, public, or other action by a member in contraventionthereof may be regarded by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion asgrounds for termination or suspension of membership pursuant to Article I of theby-laws.”EndnotesPage 174: “Full freedom of expression is encouraged at Council meetings.Participants are assured that they may speak openly, as it is the tradition ofthe Council that others will not attribute or characterize their statements inpublic media or forums or knowingly transmit them to persons who will. Allparticipants are expected to honor that commitment.”Page 175: “It would not be in compliance with the reformulated Rule, however,for any meeting participant (i) to publish a speaker’s statement in attributedform in a newspaper; (ii) to repeat it on television or radio, or on a speaker’splatform, or in a classroom; or (iii) to go beyond a memo of limitedcirculation, by distributing the attributed statement in a company or governmentagency newspaper. The language of the Rule also goes out of its way to make itclear that a meeting participant is forbidden knowingly to transmit theattributed statement to a newspaper reporter or other such person who is likelyto publish it in a public medium. The essence of the Rule as reformulated issimple enough: participants in Council meetings should not pass along anattributed statement in circumstances where there is substantial risk that itwill promptly be widely circulated or published....“In order to encourage to the fullest a free, frank, and open exchange of ideasin Council meetings, the Board of Directors has prescribed, in addition to theNon-Attribution Rule, the following guidelines. All participants in Councilmeetings are expected to be familiar with, and adhere to these Guidelines.”Page 176: “Members bringing guests should complete a ‘guest notice card,’ andacquaint their guests with the Council’s Non-Attribution Rule governing what issaid at meetings....“As a condition of use, the officers of the Council shall require each user ofCouncil records to execute a prior written commitment that he will not directlyor indirectly attribute to any living person any assertion of fact or opinionbased upon any Council record without first obtaining from such person hiswritten consent thereto.”Furthermore, in “A letter from the Chairman” in the 1994 Annual Report for theCFR, Peter G. Peterson states (page 7), “Members had occasion to meet inintensive off-the-record sessions with Secretary of State [Warren] Christopher,National Security Advisor [Anthony] Lake, Secretary [of State emeritus, GeorgePratt[ Shultz, Ambassador [Mickey] Kantor, Under Secretary of the Treasur>']Lawrence H.] Summers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other ranking officials.Next on our agenda are plans for reaching out to congressional leaders as well,an opportunity we will fashion as one component of an enhanced WashingtonProgram.” [emphases added]The True Story of the Bilderberg Group58.

Eustace Mullins, Murder by Injection: The Story of the Medical ConspiracyAgainst America, National Council for Medical Research 1988, Chapter 10PostscriptBilderberg ReportsBilderberg 2005 May 5-8Rottach-Egern, Bavaria, GermanyW hile Bush, Blair, Chirac, Berlusconi and Company attended the G8 summits ofthe world’s foremost democratically elected leaders, they were accompanied bythe massed ranks of the world media. In stark contrast, the comings and goingsat Bilderberg took place under cover of a virtual publicity blackout.After three straight years of open hostilities and tension amongst the European,British and American Bilderbergers caused by the war in Iraq, the aura ofcomplete congeniality amongst them had returned. Bilderbergers reaffirmed, andremain united in, their long-term goal to strengthen the role the UN plays inregulating global conflicts and relations.Although George W. Bush didn’t personally attend the meeting in Rottach-Egern,the U.S. Government was well represented by William Luti, Richard Perle, DennisRoss and Allan Hubbard.However, it is important to understand that Americans are no more the “Hawks”than the European Bilderbergers are the “Doves.” Europeans joined in supportingthe 1991 invasion of Iraq by President Bush’s father, celebrating, in the wordsof one notable Bilderberg hunter the end of “America’s Viet Nam syndrome.”European BilderbergersThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupalso supported former President Bill Clinton’s invasion of Yugoslavia, bringingNATO into the operation.UN Global Oil Tax and Peace-building ProposalsA much discussed subject in 2005 at Rottach-Egern was the concept of imposing aUN tax on people worldwide through a direct tax on oil at the well-head. This,in fact, sets a precedent. If enacted, it would be the first time that anon-governmental agency (read the United Nations) directly benefited from a taxon citizens of free and enslaved nations. The Bilderberg proposal called for atiny UN levy at the outset, which the consumer would hardly notice.Bilderberg wants “tax harmonization” so that high-tax countries can compete withmore tax-friendly nations — including the United States — for foreigninvestment. They would “harmonize” taxes by forcing the rate in the U.S. andother countries to rise so that socialist Sweden’s 58-per-cent level would be“competitive.”According to sources, an unidentified guest at the conference asked how globaltaxation could be sold to the American public. One European Union commissionersuggested using as the battering ram the rhetoric of helping countries buildpeaceful, stable societies once conflict subsided. Someone asked for the timingof the appeal. A former commissioner mentioned that the best time to ask forcash is once a conflict subsides and the world is subjected to brutal images ofdestruction. A Norwegian Bilderberger disagreed. What looked to be Bjorn T.Grydeland, Norway’s ambassador to the European Union, said that, on thecontrary, it’s much easier to get world attention and money for a region when aconflict rages.This was conhrmed a posteriori when Denmark’s foreign minister Per Stig Moller,during a debate in the United Nations on May 26, stated on the record that “ifthe international community is not able to act swiftly, the fragile peace is atrisk, with loss of more lives as a consequence. Denmark held the EU presidencyuntil July 1, 2005, when it was replaced by the UK.Bilderbergers were planning to use what they nominated as a UN PeacebuildingCommission, apparently to help win the peace in post-conflict countries, as oneof the tools in secretly imposing the UN tax on an unsuspecting worldpopulation.Postscript — Bilderberg ReportsMark R. Warner, governor of Virginia and a first-time Bilderberg invitee,expressed concern about how much additional financial responsibility the UnitedStates would take on as a result. At this point, Jose M. Durao Barroso,president of the European Commission, expressed a view held by many withinBilderberg that the United States did not provide a fair share of economic aidto poor countries. My sources confirm that “Kissinger and David Rockefeller,among other Americans, beamed and nodded approval.”Although the U.S. pays more into the foreign-aid piggy bank than any country inthe world, the Bilderbergers and the United Nations were poised to demand muchmore funding from it to meet the peacebuilding proposal.Neoconservative agendaI n full force was that faction known as the “neoconservatives” — those who havedetermined that Israel’s security should come at the expense of the safety tothe United States and be central to all U.S. foreign policy decisions.Most notable among this group is Richard Perle. Perle played the critical rolein pushing the United States into the war against Iraq. He was forced to resignfrom the Pentagon’s Defense Policy Board, on March 27, 2003, after it waslearned that he had been advising Goldman Sachs International, a habitualBilderberg attendee, on how it might profit from the war in Iraq.Another neoconservative figure on hand was Michael A. Ledeen, an “intellectual’sintellectual.” Ledeen serves at the American Enterprise Institute, a think tankfounded in 1943, with which Richard Perle has long been associated. AEl and theBrookings Institution operate a Joint Center for Regulatory Studies (JCRS), withthe purpose of holding lawmakers and regulators “accountable for their decisionsby providing thoughtful, objective analyses of existing regulatory programs andnew regulatory proposals.” The JCRS pushes for cost-benefit analysis ofregulations, which fits with AEI’s (and Bilderberger) ultimate goal ofderegulation.These neoconservatives were also joined this year at Bilderberg by a handful ofother top former Washington policy makers and publicists known for theirsympathies for Israel, including former StateThe True Story of the Bilderberg GroupDepartment official Richard N. Haass, president of the CFR, former AssistantSecretary of State and “father” of the Dayton accord, Richard Holbrooke, andDennis Ross of the pro-Israel Washington Institute for Near East Policy,effectively an offshoot of the America Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC).Declining Energy Reserves and Economic DownturnO f course, discussion at Bilderberg 2005 turned to oil. An AmericanBilderberger expressed concern over the sky-rocketing price of oil. One oilindustry insider at the meeting remarked that growth is not possible withoutenergy and that according to all indicators the world’s energy supply is comingto an end much faster than the world leaders have anticipated.According to sources, Bilderbergers estimated the extractable world’s oil supplyto be at a maximum of 35 years under current economic development andpopulation. However, one of the representatives of an oil cartel remarked thatwe must factor into the equation both the population explosion and economicgrowth and demand for oil in China and India. Under the revised conditions,there is apparently only enough oil to last for 20 years. No oil spells the endof the world’s financial system. So much has already been acknowledged by theWall Street Journal and the Financial Times, two periodicals who are regularlypresent at the annual Bilderberg conference.During the afternoon cocktail, a European Bilderberger noted that there is noplausible alternative to hydrocarbon energy. One American insider stated thatcurrently the world used between four and six barrels of oil for every newbarrel it found, that the prospects for a short term break through were slim, atbest.Someone asked for an estimate of the world’s accessible conventional oil supply.The amount was quoted at approximately one trillion barrels.As a side note of interest, the planet consumed a billion barrels of oil every11.5 days.Another Bilderberger asked about the hydrogen alternative to the oil supply. AU.S. government official stated gloomily that a hydrogen salvation for theworld’s imminent energy crisis is a fantasy.This discussion confirmed a public statement made in 2003 by IHS Energy, theworld s most respected consulting firm, cataloguing oilPostscript — Bilderberg Reportsreserves and discoveries, that for the first time since the 1920s there was nota single discovery of an oil field in excess of 500 million barrels.At the 2005 Bilderberg conference, the oil industry was represented by JohnBrowne, chief executive officer of BP; Sir John Kerr, director of Royal DutchShell; Peter D. Sutherland, chairman of BP; and Jeroen van der Veer, chairman ofthe committee of managing directors at Royal Dutch Shell. (Queen Beatrix of TheNetherlands, Royal Dutch Shell’s principal shareholder, is a fully fledgedmember of the Bilderbergers. Her father. Prince Bernhard, was one of thefounders of the group back in 1954.)It should be noted that in late 2003, oil and gas giant Royal Dutch Shellannounced it had overstated its reserves by as much as 20 per cent; in early2004 it reduced its estimated oil and gas reserves by about 4.5 billion barrels,but in October had to apply an additional cut of 1.15 billion barrels in reserveestimates. In fact. Shell’s three cuts in reserve estimates prompted theresignation of its co-chairman. The Los Angeles Times (January 18, 2005)reported: “For petroleum firms, reserves amount to nothing less than ‘the valueof the company.’”At Rottach-Egern in May 2005, the industry’s top executives tried to figure outhow to keep the truth about diminishing oil reserv^es from reaching the public.Public knowledge of the diminishing reserves directly translate into lower shareprices, which could destroy financial markets, leading to a collapse of theworld economy.An American Bilderberger wondered what it would take for the oil price to goback to $25 a barrel. Martin S. Feldstein, president of the National Bureau ofEconomic Research, added that $50 a barrel involves greater cash flow. Cheap oilslows economic growth because it depresses commodity prices and reduces worldliquidity. Another American Bilderberger reported that if the price of oil wereto go down to its previous low of $25 a barrel, the debt-driven asset bubblewould explode. Yet another American Bilderberger, believed to be Allan Hubbard,confirmed that the general public does not realise that the price for cheap oilcan be the bursting of the debt bubble. There was a strong indication that theU.S. Federal Reserve was extremely concerned about the debt bubble.A British Bilderberger noted that oil at $120 a barrel would greatly benefitBritain and the United States, but Russia and China would be the biggestwinners. An expert in international relations and policy studiesThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupnoted that for the Chinese this would be a real bonanza. The Chinese importedenergy not for domestic consumption but, instead, to hael its growing cheapexports—a cost that would be duly passed on to foreign buyers. A European bankerpointed out that Russia could effectively devalue the dollar by re-denominatingits energy trade with Europe from dollars into euros, forcing Europe’s centralbanks to rebalance their foreign exchange reserves in favour of the euro.Jean-Claude Trichet, Governor of the European Central Bank, was present duringthe debate.Someone raised a question about the impact of a sharp rise of energy prices onasset values. A German Bilderberger responded that the net effect is a de factodepreciation of money, misidentified as growth.EU Referendum in FranceT he first day was dominated by talk of EU referendum in France and whetherChirac could persuade France to vote Yes on May 29. A Yes vote, according tosources within Bilderberg would put a lot of pressure on Tony Blair to finallydeliver Britain into the waiting arms of the New World Order through their ownreferendum on the treaty scheduled for 2006. Matthias Nass wondered out loudwhether a No vote in France could cause political turmoil in Europe andovershadow Britain’s six-month EU presidency starting on July 1. Bilderbergershoped that Blair and Chirac, whose at times open animosity has spilled into apublic arena on more than one occasion, could work together for mutual benefitand political survival. Another European Bilderberger added that both leadersmust put behind them as quickly as possible all past disputes on such topics asIraq, the liberalization of Europe’s economy and the future of budget rebateBritain receives from the EU and work towards complete European integration,which could desintigrate if France’s often “hard-headed and obstinate people,”in the words of a British Bilderberger, did not do the right thing, meaning giveup voluntarily their independence for the “greater good” of a Federal Europeansuper state!A German Bilderberger insider said that France’s “Yes” vote was in troublebecause of the outsourcing of jobs. Jobs in Germany and France are going to Asiaand Poland” |to take advantage of cheap labor]. Poland was one of the formerCommunist republics that have been admitted to the European Union bringing thetotal membershipPostscript — Bilderberg Reportsto 25 nations. A German politician wondered out loud how Tony Blair should goabout convincing Britons to embrace the European Constitution, when due to theoutsourcing of jobs, both Germany and France were suffering a 10% unemploymentwhile Britain was doing well economically. The French electorate handilyrejected EU membership.Auna TelecomunicacionesA t a Saturday night cocktail partyat the luxurious DorintSofitelSeehotelOberfahrt in Rottach-Egern, Bavaria, Munich, several Bilderbergers sharing thestanding bar with Queen Beatrix of Holland and Donald Graham, Washington Post’sCEO were discussing the upcoming sale of Spanish telecommunications and cablegiant Auna. Auna operates fixed line telephone services, a mobile-phone network,cable television system and is also an Internet provider. One of theBilderbergers familiar with the matter [believed to be Henry Kravis, based onthe physical description of the source at the meeting] stated that Anna’s mobileoperations could bring in some 10 billion euros including debt, while anotherBilderberger, a tall man with a receding hairline added that its fixed-lineassets could fetch some 2.6 billion euros. An abundance of cheap credit and lowinterest rates made Auna an appetising target for private-equity buyers.Sources close to the Bilderbergers stated off-the-record that Kohlberg KravisRoberts & Co, a private-equity firm, was interested in buying all of Auna.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co is represented at Bilderberg meetings by itsluminary billionaire Henry Kravis and his small town Quebec-born wife MarieJosee Kravis, a Senior Fellow at the neoconservative Hudson Institute."},{"pageContent":"ChinaE uropean and American Bilderbergers realizing the most urgent of needs toexpand into developing markets in order to help sustain the illusion of endlessgrowth agreed to name Pascal Lamy, a French Socialist and a fanatical supporterof a European super state as the next WIO President. It will be remembered thatWashington gave conditional support to Lamy’s nomination in exchange forEuropean support of Paul Wolfowitz as head of the World Bank.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAccording to insider sources within the Bilderberger group, Lamy was chosen tohelp steer the global trading system through a time of rising protectionistsentiment in rich countries such as France and Germany, both reeling from highunemployment and reticent toward increasingly muscular demands for market accessfrom emerging economies. Third World states, for example, were insisting on cutsto EU and U.S. farm subsidies. The WTO liberalization drive collapsed inacrimony in Seattle in 1999 and again in Cancun in 2003.The Bilderbergers secretly agreed on the need to force the poor countries into aglobalized market for cheap goods while simultaneously forcing the poor intobecoming customers. The current rift with China is a good example, as theChinese have flooded the Western countries with cheap goods, among themtextiles, driving down prices. As a trade off, the Bilderbergers entered into anemerging market ripe and vulnerable to superior western know-how. Similardeveloping countries are slowly acquiring more purchasing power and theindustrialized world is gaining a foothold in their domestic economies bytargeting them for cheap exports.Further discussion on China was led off with a series of rhetorical questionsfrom the speaker. Was China really abusing its competitive advantage, or was itbeing victimized by the U.S. and the EU? Is a trade war imminent? Should Chinarevalue the yuan (its currency), and, if so, how should it do this?An American Bilderberger noted that China in 2005 was one of the leading worldeconomic powers whose actions influence the world economy. Another American,believed to be but not positively identified as Michael Ledeen of the AmericanEnterprise Institute, said that if China doesn t revalue the yuan it would causethe entire world trade system to go out of whack. Someone mentioned that thecurrent situation could be dangerous for the Chinese economy due to the creationof excess liquidity. Elena Nemirovskaya, founder of the Moscow School ofPolitical Studies, asked what would happen if the yuan were allowed to floatfreely. An economist responded that this could bring about serious consequencesto the world s financial markets. China’s foreign exchange reserves are to alarge extent made up of U.S. Treasury bills. An appreciation of the yuan wouldcause its dollar reserves to depreciate.A German Bilderberger pointed out that this could force the Federal Reserve toraise interest rates, thus causing the current housing boom InPostscript — Bilderberg Reportsthe U.S. to come to a screeching halt. An oversized Dutchman pointed out thatthe International Monetary Fund needs to play an active role in helping theyuan.“Is there a real danger, then,” asked an Italian Bilderberger, “of this disputedeteriorating into an all-out trade war?” “Not likely,” according to anunidentified blond man from Scandinavia, believed to be a Swede, “because Chinahas totally integrated itself into the market economy.”An American Bilderberger and a member of the U.S. Government noted that all theposturing is part of the act to keep the voters back home happy.China’s moves into the Mekong region did not go unnoticed at the conference.William J. Luti, U.S. Deputy Under-Secretary of Defense for Near Eastern andSouth Asian Affairs, explained that China’s rapid expansion into the Mekongregion, comprising Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Viet Nam, couldthreaten U.S. interests in the area. Such moves by China would give it anenhanced role in South-East Asia.Over the prior several years, China had invested heavily in transportinfrastructure development linking China’s southwestern Yunan province and theMekong region. A European Bilderberger pointed out that China was heavilydependent on oil imports. Someone asked for a figure. A tall, lanky man withglasses, believed to be Jeroen van der Veer, Chairman of Royal Dutch Shell,responded that some 40 per cent of China’s supply was imported. In fact, China’smove into the Mekong region was the result of acute awareness that the country’senergy supplies are vulnerable to interference. Overall, 32 per cent of itsenergy supplies, China’s lifeblood, passed through the narrow and easily blockedStrait of Malacca.U.S. Airunes and Pension FundsA n American Bilderberger inquired about the effect of $50 oil on the crisis ingovernment pension insurance. High oil prices threaten the economic viability ofairlines and motor vehicles sectors. The employees’ pensions at U.S. Airways hadbeen recently terminated by the bankruptcy court. United Airlines and otherswere on the list as well. An American Bilderberger noted that the U.S. SocialSecurity System was going through its worst accounting crisis in years. TheThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupspecter was raised of companies defaulting on their financial obligations to theworkers. Someone commented that government-run pension funds would not be ableto shoulder an industry-wide default on their obligations without a Federalbailout.Media AttendeesT he year’s invitees included Nicolas Beytout, editor-in-chief, Figaro;Oscar Bronner, publisher and editor, Der Standard; Donald Graham, chairman ofthe Washington Post; Matthias Nass, deputy editor.

TheEconomist. Micklethwait and Wooldridge acted as the meeting’s rapport builders.Iran-Russia-ChinaA ccording to reports, a French Bilderberger pointedly asked Henry Kissinger ifthe U.S Government’s sabre-rattling against Iran meant the beginning of newhostilities. Richard Haass, CFR President, after asking for his turn to speak,dismissed the notion of an Iran invasion as unrealistic due to the sheerphysical size of the country and its large population, not to mention thebillions of dollars involved in getting the operation off the ground. Up to theeyeballs in the Iraq quagmire, the United States military was wary of any newadventures in hostile terrain against a much healthier enemy, both betterprepared and organised.A Swiss Bilderberger asked if a hypothetical attack on Iran would involve apre-emptive strike against its nuclear sites. Richard Haass replied that such anattack would prove to be counterproductive because Tehran s counterattackoptions could range from “unleashing terrorism and promoting instability inIraq, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, to triggering oil price increases that couldtrigger a global economic crisis.” During dinner, according to several sources,Richard Perle criticised Haass’ position and explained his opposition to hisview.Postscript — Bilderberg Ri-:portsA woman believed to be Heather Munroe-Blum, Vice-Chancellor of McGillUniversity, Quebec, Canada, asked a rhetorical question about what would happenif Iran were to continue building its nuclear arsenal. Haass replied that inthis scenario, the United States would have no choice but to grant Iran the samestatus as it did to Pakistan and India.A U.S. General commented that the China-Iran-Russia alliance is changing thegeopolitical situation in the area. Rapprochement between Russia and China wasviewed by the Bilderbergers as a significant event not to be taken lightly, eventhough it had received little media attention in the West.A secret U.S. Government report was cited wherein, according to sources, theChinese had spent upwards of several billion dollars in acquiring Russia’slatest and most sophisticated weapons technology. Someone pointed out that theSino-Russian alliance was not limited to military trade and that thenon-military exchange of goods had grown 100 per cent since the beginning of theBush presidency.A delegate at the conference, believed but not positively identified by SecretService sources to be Anatoly Sharansky, a former Israeli Minister for Jerusalemand Diaspora Affairs, stated categorically during Friday night cocktails thatthe counterweight to the Moscow-Beijing-Tehran axis is the U.S.-Israel-Turkeyalliance. A financial expert from a European nation intervened by stating thatRussia was much better off financially than four years prior, before tax revenuegenerated by fuel and arms production and exports, as a result of heavy emphasison military production, had financed strong growth of wages and pension incomes,boosting private consumption.A German Bilderberger pointedly asked Richard Perle if the “war on terrorism”would intensify over the second term of the Bush presidency. Perle reportedlygave no reply but screwed up his face and looked away.Bilderberg luminary Richard Haass pointedly told Richard Perle during Saturdaynight cocktails that the Bush Administration had overestimated its ability tochange the world. Haass, according to several sources at the conference, isreported to have stated that regime change can be attractive because it is “lessdistasteful than diplomacy and less dangerous than living with new nuclearstates.” However, he noted, “There is only one problem: it is highly unlikely tohave the desired effect soon enough.”The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupIranT he presence of U.S. General James L Jones, Supreme Allied Commander Europe,and Retired U.S. Army General John M. Keane at the Bilderberg meeting in Germanysuggested that the next stage of the conquest was about to begin.An American neocon at an afternoon drink-fest said he was convinced that the“Iranian opposition movement” would unseat the mullahs. Nicolas Beytout of LeFigaro exclaimed, “You don’t really believe that!” A tall, bald, well-dressedSwiss gentleman, believed to be Pascal Couchepin, head of the powerfulDepartment of Home Affairs, replied reflexively that it will only succeed inhaving the Iranians rally behind their government. He ended by saying, “Youdon’t know Iranians.” Tempers boiled over momentarily when a FrenchBilderberger, raising his voice, told Kissinger that “an attack on Iran willescalate out of control.” According to sources working for the CIA and thespecial unit of the U.S. Army charged with protecting the U.S. delegation atRottach-Egern, both the CIA and the FBI were in open revolt against the BushWhite House.A member of the Greek Parliament asked Eival Gilady, strategic adviser toIsraeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, “What would happen if Iran were toretaliate?” Someone pointed out that even if the United States or Israel were toshow restraint in their use of tactical nuclear weapons, an attack on Iran’snuclear facilities would surely not only engulf neighbor states, raising thelikelihood of a broader war, but also succeed in creating a nuclear disasterthrough radiation spilling over a wide area.As a follow-up question, someone asked, “How much of this war has to do withAmerica doing its utmost to prevent Iran from becoming a regional power?” AFrench Bilderberger wished to know if the impending attack on Iran would involvethe United States and Israel working in tandem, or if it would be a NATOoperation. The question was directed at NATO Secretary-General Jaap G. de HoopScheffer. Another European Bilderberger wanted to know how the U.S.was planning to cope with three wars simultaneously, referring to Iraq,Afghanistan and Iran.The Israeli delegation was pressed to answer if Israel was prepared to usenuclear weapons against Iran. The answer was incoherent.Postscript — Bilderberg Ri:portsRussian vs American Foreign PolicyP olicy discussion began with a European expert on international relationspointing out that over the next several years Russia was poised to assert itselfand increasingly challenge Bush Government foreign policy goals.Someone openly asked the committee if the world was safer than in 2001 and if itwould be safer in four years’ time. A Dutchman responded by saying there waslittle doubt that the hand of international terrorism has been substantiallystrengthened by the U.S. Government’s policy in the Middle East. A DanishBilderberger wondered about what had happened to the U.S. promise to take alower-key approach in Iraq — referring to the heavy-handed tactics employed byAmerican troops in the siege of Fallujah, which played an important role inalienating a large cross-section of moderate Arab states. Additionally, theDutchman pointed out, terrorism hadn’t been confined to the Iraq theater ofoperations but had escalated across Asia, Africa and most of the Middle East.A blonde woman, believed to be Therese Delpech, Director of Strategic Affairsfor the Atomic Energy Commission, said that unilateralist policy actions by theU.S. will only succeed in alienating friendly nations and emboldening enemycombatants. “The U.S. is the most powerful nation in the world, but it is notmore powerful than the world. It must coordinate its policy with other greatpowers to achieve its ends.”An oil expert believed to be from Britain, possibly Sir John Kerr of Royal DutchShell, focused on the oil pipeline from Siberia to northern China. TheBilderbergers openly wondered at the medium-term repercussions of this deal. AnAmerican investment banker asked just how much oil was expected to flow throughthis pipeline. Another member of the oil cartel offered 65-80 million tons peryear as a ballpark figure.The 2005 German ElectionsT he Bilderbergers also discussed how to dust off the “boring” image of AngelaMerkel, Germany’s “future leader,” ahead of the German elections on September18, 2005. A short, oversized male BilderbergerThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupoffered an opinion that in order for the widest cross-section of the Germanpublic to accept Merkel (leader of the Christian Democratic Union opposition) asChancellor, it would be important to give a new definition to the term “familyvalues.” German Bilderbergers well-versed in the conservative Bavariancollective psyche believed that Merkel, a divorcee with a doctorate in physics,didn’t have a “reliable” enough image to attract sufficient votes in thatstaunchly conservative area of the country. According to people within earshotof the discussion, the idea “in the upcoming campaign would be to stress theimportance of families rather than marriage as an institution.” Nevertheless,Merkel was elected.Bilderbergers pushing Gerhard Schroeder aside in favour of a new candidate couldvery well signify that, after three years of strife between American andEuropean Bilderbergers over the war in Iraq, the secret society was ready tomove forward with a much-revised and more cohesive policy. It must be rememberedthat Schroeder, along with French President Chirac, was one of the mostvociferous European critics of the U.S.-led Iraq intervention.Both Schroeder, representing the left, and Merkel, representing the right, wereowned by the Bilderbergers. It has been the group’s policy since its inceptionin 1954 to own both horses in the race.Bilderberg 2006 June 8-11Brookstreet Hotel, Kanata, Ottawa, CanadaT he 54th Bilderberg meeting returned to Canada. The conference dealt withEuropean-American relations. Energy, Russia, Iran, China, the Middle East,Terrorism and Immigration. Internationally renowned media groups were invited toparticipate, among them The Economist, Financial Times, Die Zeit and DerStandard from Germany, America On Line, International Herald Tribune, Le Figaro,The Times of London, Indigo Books, Grupo Prisa from Spain, Canada’s TheGlobe and Mail and the Toronto Star, Time-Warner and Denmark’s Politiken.Technical problems prevented a more detailed description of the discussion atthis meeting; the following summary will have to suffice.Postscript — Bilderberg ReportsEnergyE nergy problems continued to dominate Bilderberger discussions.Oil and natural gas are finite, non-renewable resources. From the beginning ofthe twentieth century mankind has used up massive quantities of hydrocarbons(oil, natural gas) created over millions of years on the planet. Do we, atleast, have another one hundred years of oil reserves left, a good enoughcushion, while we look for a feasible solution? Or do, we have about twentyyears of proven petroleum supplies left, as the Bilderbergers themselves hadconfirmed at their 2005 Rottach-Egern meeting in Germany?Oil wells are very difficult to find. The investments energy corporations likeBP, Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon, Lukoil, Texaco, Unocal are required to make inorder to find the oil can be counted by the hundreds of millions and billions ofdollars. What’s worse, in order to stay on par, they need to turn around andfind another and then another and then another oil well that will guarantee themand their shareholders profit. Profit. That’s the name of the game. And profit,which is achieved through growth, is not possible without energy.As global demand for oil and natural gas continues growing much faster than newsupplies are being found, these corporations, and their corporate profits andbottom lines, have a problem. As reservoirs dry up, the cost of exploration isskyrocketing and the rewards are diminishing. To stay competitive and be in aposition to maintain a competitive advantage over their rivals, the energycorporations, whose board members and majority shareholders happen to be all ofthe most powerful individuals and corporations in the world, must maintain andexpand their control over more and more oil fields in order to continueguaranteeing their shareholders profitable return on their investment. (This isthe myth of infinite growth.)As the world turns, and as oil and natural gas supplies dwindle while demandsoars dramatically, especially with Indian and Chinese booming economies' whowant all the trinkets and privileges of an American way of life, we, as thePlanet, have entered a new phase of oil production and discovery. From now on,the only sure thing is that1. The average American consumes 25 barrels of oil a year. Average Chinese: 1.3barrels/year. Average Indian: less than one [The Christian Science Monitor,January 20, 2005].The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupsupply will continue to diminish and prices will continue to increase. In theseconditions world conflict is a certainty.This sentiment was also expressed by French Prime Minister and Bilderberg memberDominique de Villepin, who was quoted by Reuters on September 1, 2005 saying,“Wehave entered the post-oil era. I want to draw all the consequences of this andgive a real impulse to energy savings and to the use of renewable energies.”Jeroen van der Veer, CEO of Royal Dutch Shell and a full-time member of theBilderberg inner circle confirmed what the Bush administration and other energyexperts have felt for quite some time. In an interview with theBilderberg-influenced Financial Times on January 24, 2006, he stated, “My viewis that ‘easy’ oil has probably passed its peak.”Rest assured, the Bilderbergers and their cohorts were well aware of theimminent oil crisis. Energy, in fact, over the past two decades has always beenthe first item on their annual agenda. In April 2001, four and a half monthsprior to 9-11, the Council on Foreign Relations and James A. Baker III (Bush ISecretary of State, CFR, Bilderberg and Trilateral Commission member) publisheda detailed study of world energy problems. The report, which appeared on theCFR’s Web site, confirmed awareness of the catastrophic consequences: “Strongeconomic growth across the globe and new global demands for more energy hasmeant the end of sustainable surplus capacity in hydrocarbon fuels and thebeginning of capacity limitations. In fact, the world is currently precariouslyclose to utilizing all of its available global oil production capacity, raisingthe chances of an oil supply crisis with more substantial consequences than seenin three decades. These choices will affect other U.S. policy objectives: U.S.policy toward the Middle East; U.S. policy toward the former Soviet Union andChina; and the fight against international terrorism. Meanwhile, across much ofthe developing world, energy infrastructure is being severely tested by theexpanding material demands of a growing middle class, especially in the highgrowth, high population economies of Asia. As demand growth collided with supplyand capacity limits at the end of the last century, prices rose across theenergy spectrum, athome and abroad. (Strategic Energy Policy Challenges for the XXI century, CFRreport).James Woolsey, the former CIA director, is a member of a powerful circleresponsible for promoting an extremist agenda known as thePostscript — Bilderberg Reports“Project For The New American Century” (PNAC). This is an aggressive “defense”and foreign policy strategy developed since 1997 by a group backed by theneoconservatives around the Bush administration, and whose implementation inpractice is led by Vice President Cheney. Anything Woolsey has to say is worth aquote in the press. Thus, in an interview by the Washington Post on June 7,2000, Woolsey talked about the energy crisis, which, he said, “should have asevere impact, be global in scope, and be difficult to solve. Plainly, it willbe unprecedented,” and since “... the Mid East will increasingly become thesource of the world’s oil,” he went on to say, “this is a strategic problem forus and for many other countries.”In fact, he admitted in an article titled, “The New Petroleum” for the journalForeign Affairs, January/February 1999: “The underlying goal of the U.N. forcein Gulf War I, which included 500,000 American troops, was to ensure continuedand unfettered access to petroleum.”Energy for the Bilderberg cabal is clearly of utmost concern. One of the pointsdiscussed on the Bilderberger agenda in 2000 squarely dealt with oil and theCaspian Basin.In our current world, energy is oil and natural gas. Bush is oil. Oil is Bush.Bush’s administration is filled with ex-oil men and women: Bush, Cheney,Rumsfeld, and Rice (a former ExxonMobil board member). These people, before anyof us even knew, were only too well aware of the situation and terribleconsequences. Initially it was believed that the Caspian Basin held enough oiland natural gas reserves to supply the markets for the rest of the 2T' century,but some time between the end of 1998 and the beginning of the year 2000, as topsecret reports on drilling and exploration from the Caspian Basin came in, thesepeople became aware of the pending calamity and the imminence of aninternational economic collapse. What would happen if the markets andsubsequently, the shareholders and the politicians, and ultimately the peoplefound out that the energy numbers were being inflated to hide the pendingdisaster?The Caspian results could not be kept secret forever.Some argue that oil price hikes are a speculative phenomenon. Others argue thatproduction cuts are man-made, that they are artificial, and that this is a clearcase of greed and price-gouging with the OPEC and capitalist west colluding tocut production in order to make more money. Assuredly the profits of the oilcompanies are at recordThe True Story of the Bilderberg Grouphighs and there are industry insiders that claim political and industrymanipulation.The pessimistic predictions have dripped continually, Britain’s ForeignSecretary, Jack Straw, during his address to a group of more than 150 Britishdiplomats on January 10, 2003, where the Guardian of London reported that Strawadmitted future oil supply was a key motivator in Britain’s decision toparticipate in the U.S.-led Iraq war. The Times of London, on December 11, 2004,also reported that with “the depletion of gas reserves in the North Sea and theIrish Sea ... it is expected that Britain will have to import 75 per cent of itsgas by 2015.”According to the World Socialist Web site, “more than 92% of Europe’s oil and81% of its gas, will have to be imported from oversees within 30 years. Thecountry, or countries, able to establish control over this vital resource willsecure a major advantage over their international rivals. This is a prime factormotivating U.S. policy in the Middle East. By occupying Iraq and seizing its oilresources, the U.S. hopes to establish its undisputed hegemony over Europe andJapan.”’Oil energy expert Jan Lundberg’s calculations say that the United States lostbetween 20% and 25% of its energy supply as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Oilprices rose to over USS70/barrel, yet the Saudis continued to not increaseproduction. These are the same Saudis, who, for some time, have been braggingabout the infinite quantities of oil to be found under their feet. Are theytrying to gauge world markets? Or is the simple answer is that they just can’t.That, they are flat out.^ If the Saudis are out of spare oil, we are in deeptrouble.You can see this crisis of cataclysmic proportions happening all around you.Gasoline prices and natural gas prices are at, or near, their all-time highs.Fruit and vegetables are more expensive than ever, yet their quality has neverbeen poorer. Transportation costs are expensive, so are your bananas. MarkWilliams, writing for the Technology Review in February 2005 had this to say:“If the actions, rather than the words, of the oil business major playersprovide the best gauge of how they see the future, then ponder the following.Crude oil prices have doubled since 2 001, but oil companies have increasedtheir budgets2. “Britain: Foreign secretary admits oil central to war vs. Iraq,” WorldSocialist Web Site, Julie Hyland, January 14, 2003.3. “Paris Peak Oil conference reveals deepening crisis,” From the Wildernesspublication. May 30, 2003Postscript — Bilderberg Reportsfor exploring new oil fields by only a small fraction. Likewise, U.S. refineriesare working close to capacity, yet no new refinery has been constructed since1976.”They are not drilling more because they are certain there are no more large oilpools out there to find. More drilling doesn’t mean more oil. It means higherexpense, which inadvertently cuts into their profit. It also means more holes inthe ground. If these holes hold little or no oil, they are worthless. In fact,“oil companies are spending only 12% of their total capital expenditure onfinding new oil fields, down from nearly a third in 1990,” according to a reportfrom investment bank Credit Suisse First Boston.The bank’s statement was picked up by the Dow Jones Newswire service on January17, 2005. The implications of this should be self-evident. The reason that thereis virtually no exploration or refinery construction is that the oil cartel,represented by the most powerhil members within the Bilderberg group, such asthe Rockefellers, Peter Sutherland [BP] and Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands,understand there is no more significant oil to find. Their investment will neverpay offDoes the end of oil mean the end of the world’s financial system? This hasalready been acknowledged by the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times,two fulltime confidants of the Bilderberger inner circle. An oil report fromGoldman Sachs (another fulltime player of the Bilderberger elite), published onMarch 30, 2005 increased the predicted oil price-range for the year 2005-6 from$55-$80 per barrel to $55-$ 105. During the 2006 meeting, Bilderbergersconfirmed that their short-range price estimate for oil for the 2006-07 periodcontinued to hover around $ 150/barrel.According to sources present at the meeting, the world’s leading executivestried in vain to find a way to prevent the public from learning the truth aboutthe alarming decrease of estimated oil reserves. Public awareness of the fall ofthe reserves could give way to a panic, causing an immediate price explosion,and forcing a collapse of the world economy, according to the same sources.Besides, the Bilderbergers did not wish a drop in the price of oil because lowoil prices might precipitate the implosion of the debt bubble.The U.S. Federal Reserve System, which Is heavily influenced by the BilderbergGroup is very concerned about the debt bubble.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupSince the technology bubble burst in March 2000, many investors have sought thesafety of the national debt and the housing markets as opposed to the inherentrisks of the Stock Exchange, weary of the losses caused by the bubble and by theaccounting scandals of the likes of Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, Global Crossing, aswell as by the period of geopolitical uncertainties caused by 9-11 and the Warin Iraq.This and the deliberate policy of both the Federal Reserve Board of the UnitedStates and the European Central Bank of maintaining low interest rates, thustrying to assure that, in such a difficult period, liquidity would never beabsent from the world’s financial markets, bond prices increased to all-timemaximums. The Federal Reserve thought that this trend would be modified as soonas they began raising interest rates, as it had been doing since 2004.Nevertheless, bond prices, far from falling as was expected continued theirupward climb to historical highs, giving way to the debt bubble. The problem isthat, if now high oil prices unleash an inflationary process, this bubble couldcollapse, causing important losses amongst investors, especially the bankingsector and the owners of the capital-risk hedge funds, unleashing along the wayfinancial crises as devastating in scope and magnitude as the 1997 Asian crisis.IranI nstead of knocking off Iraq then moving promptly to the next target — Iran —the Bush administration has now played the foil for Iran, and put within Iran’sreach what it has sought for decades; the position of key political actor in theregion and the world. But the going is tough. During Bilderberg meeting 2006,European delegates told the U.S. contingent in blunt terms that the Iranadventure was off the table, and that in case the Bush administration was stillentertaining a notion of attack, it would have to do it alone.The United States needs to control the region, not only to control its oilreserves but, most importantly, to help It sustain world economic hegemony.Under this strategic design, regional states will be turned to weak domains ofsectarian sheikhs with little or no sovereignty, and, by implication, a patheticagenda for their economic development. Regional chaos favors the spread ofIslamic fundamentalism, whichPostscript — Bilderberg Reportsin turn reinforces the process of political and social disintegration supportedby the Bilderbergers.Imminent collapse of the U.S. housing marketT he world found itself at the precipice of the most devastating financialcollapse in modern history. There was no set date to this calamitous event, butit was expected to happen very, very soon. One of the principal reasons is thefact that today, the U.S. financial system is dependent for survival on the mostimportant real-estate bubble in human history. A hyperinflationary spiral hasforced housing price hikes of between 10 and 40 % per annum over the lastseveral years in some areas, which have pushed the prices of millions of homesinto the stratosphere.Leading American banking institutions voiced their alarm at the precarioussituation of the U.S. real estate market. Page one of the business section ofthe Washington Post on April 7, 2006 warned of the imminent collapse of the realestate bubble in some parts of the United States.That year the cumulative value of all American homes was a chilling 12 trilliondollars. Millions of families have purchased $500,000 houses, making 40 to 60 %of annual earnings in mortgage payments, betting that if they could keep thehouse for a 2-5 year period, they would be able to resell it for a considerableprofit in a bullish real estate market.The bad news was that soon the pool of prospective buyers would have disappearedforever. Many families worked a combined three jobs per family to pay themortgage. The next round of layoffs that eliminated one of those jobs wouldleave them without means to make their monthly payments, causing a major defaulten masse on mortgage payments throughout the country.The percentage of foreclosures on mortgages insured by the Federal HousingAdministration (used mainly as a barometer for low and mid income families)reached 10 % in urban areas of the United States — the highest percentage overthe prior decade. When the accumulative wave of mortgage foreclosures spread,the real estate bubble would burst, annihilating trillions of dollars in housingvalue.“We are sitting on top of the collapse of the real-estate bubble in the UnitedStates,” said one Bilderberger delegate during the June 9The True Story of the Bilderberg Groupsession at the luxurious Brookstreet Hotel. “The exact date of when it willexplode, I do not know. But it will explode. People who have taken years to paydown their $500,000 homes will be lucky if they can get $100,000 for them.”Where to invest the money?T he fundamental principles of gold and silver, in spite of their extremevolatility and recent price drop, were on a medium-term trend up; the Americandollar and the Dow Jones, on a medium-term trend down. Although the manipulation(suppression) of the price of gold over the past several decades is very welldocumented, the prior two years had shown that the anti-gold cartel had lost itsability to keep gold prices down.Furthermore, the central banks of both China and the Russian Federation hadrecently announced their intentions of buying large quantities of gold. Theprice of oil, as I mentioned, was expected to continue to rise.Bilderberg 2007 May 31 - June 3,Istanbul, TurkeyA fter a sumptuous lunch on this warm and sunny 3rd of June, most Bilderbergersreturned to their home countries, freshly armed with precise instructions fromthe Steering Committee regarding how to proceed in covertly expanding the powersof the One World Government.As a rhetorical question, can someone please explain to me how it is thatprogressive liberals such as John Edwards and Hillary Clinton, as well asdo-gooder humanitarians with multiple social projects ongoing such as theRockefellers and every Royal House in Europe, can perennially attend Bilderbergmeetings apparently knowing that the final objective of this despicable group ofhoodlums is a fascist One World Empire? How can it be orchestrated?The idea is to give to each country a political constitution and an appropriatenational economic structure, organized for the followingPostscript — Bilderberg Reportspurposes: (1) to place political power into the hands of chosen people andeliminate all intermediaries; (2) to establish a maximum concentration ofindustries and suppress all unwarranted competition; (3) to establish absolutecontrol of prices of all goods and raw materials (Bilderbergers make it possiblethrough their iron-grip control of the World Bank, the International MonetaryFund and the World Trade Organization); and (4) to create judicial and socialinstitutions that would prevent all extremes of action.The following is a summary of some key points made, with additional commentaryadded. Other subjects discussed: climate change and global warming, Turkey’srole in the new European Union, World Bank reforms, Middle East geopolitics, theconflict in Iraq, Iran’s potential nuclear threat, and the future of democracyand populism.Robert Zoellick and the World BankT he United States delegation was standing unanimously behind Robert Zoellick’scandidacy as the next President of the World Bank. Zoellick is a 53-year-oldWall Street executive, a former official in two Bush administrations and afree-market fundamentalist. During the meeting, he pledged “to work to restoreconfidence in the bank.”“We need to put our differences aside and focus on the future together. Ibelieve that the World Bank’s best days are still to come,” Zoellick said. Thechances of Zoellick not being approved for the presidency were slim to none. Thefinal decision was to be made in late June by the bank’s 24-member board ofdirectors.The United States and Europe have a tacit agreement that the World Bank’sPresident should always be a U.S. national, while its sister institution, theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), should always be headed by a European.Nevertheless, according to our sources at the conference, European Bilderbergerswere not at all pleased with continuing the status quo, in which the U.S. onceagain nominated a single candidate after informal consultations with World Bankmembers.The Zoellick nomination also appears to short-circuit burgeoning calls forreform of this selection process at the World Bank, one of the cornerstones ofthe global financial architecture designed by the victors of World War 11. OneBelgian Bilderberger proposed “a merit-basedThe True Story of the Bilderberg Groupselection process, without regard to nationality,” something which willobviously be discarded by the inept Bush administration. What is quiteremarkable is that on several occasions European Bilderbergers have openlyrejected the current model, saying “the nomination reeks of double standards,”especially because both the USA and the World Bank preach accountability andtransparency to developing countries, the main clients of the bank.But with the IMF under the control of a Spaniard, Rodrigo Rato, and the EuropeanCentral Bank headed by a Frenchman, Jean-Claude Trichet, it was difficult toimagine that the U.S. would give up control of the World Bank. Only the U.S.Federal Reserve would then remain in the hands of the Americans.“Replacing one Bush appointee with another will not resolve the fundamentalgovernance problems of the World Bank,” said one Scandinavian. “Membergovernments should reject a backdoor deal that leaves the bank’s governancestructure intact, and should press for an open, merit-based selection process,”he said. Zoellick’s name also raised eyebrows among development groups for hisclose ties to the U.S. establishment and corporate interests.One of the attendees asked Zoellick how he was planning to patch uprelationships with Third and Fourth World nations when he was best rememberedduring his tenure as U.S. Trade Representative for arm-twisting poor nations’governments to adhere to U.S.-imposed intellectual-property laws that makemedicines, for example, unaffordable in the developing world. Zoellick has beena close friend to the brand-name pharmaceutical industry, and the bilateraltrade agreements he has negotiated effectively block access to genericmedications for millions of people.However, what has really riled both the American and European delegates is thefact that the World Bank’s dirty linen was being washed in public, thanks ingreat part to Paul Wolfowitz and his ineptness, which incidentally he blamed onthe press.On June 25, Robert Zoellick was unanimously elected President of the World Bankfor a five-year term, taking over from Paul Wolfowitz on July 1. In a statementposted at http://www.worldbank.org, he said. Once I start at the World Bank, Iwill be eager to meet the people who drive the agenda of overcoming poverty inall regions, with particular attention to Africa, advancing social and economicPostscript — Bilderberg Reportsdevelopment, investing in growth, and encouraging hope, opportunity anddignity.”Relations with Russianother issue of great concern to both American and EuropeanBilderbergers was Russia’s current muscle-flexing on the issue of energy. Thecontroversy over the TNK-BP license, British Petroleum’s Russian venture, wasjust one of many circumstances causing anger amongst the globalist elite.One American Bilderberger said that after years of economic stagnation, “Russiais acting against unipolarity’s accommodating ideologies and politics, againstits recently resurgent manifestations and machinations, and against theinstruments of its perpetuation, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization[NATO].”Bilderberg 2007 served as a consensus-building exercise to decide on a commonpolicy and strategy to deal with Russia’s resurgence. In particular, Bilderbergwas not at all happy with Russia’s current strategy of actively dismantling whatremains of “the atmosphere of acquiescence to America’s will,” in the words ofone Bilderberger, which arose in the post-Soviet period and was absolutelycrucial to the thriving of U.S.-led unipolarity.That was in the beginning of the 1990s, the early stages of the Yeltsin reign.With the wholesale looting of Russia in the 1990s through shock therapy and theloans-for-shares scheme, engineered by the socialist theoreticians at Harvardsuch as Jeffrey Sachs, Andrei Schliefer, David Tipton and Jonathan Hay, thecountry was brought into the dawn of the 21st century capitalist economy. As aresult, Russia eventually toppled into anarchy, its population rendereddesperate; its ability to support a world-class military establishment wassmashed, which then made it inevitable that colonial exploitation would occur.That is exactly what George Ball was proposing during the Bilderberg 1968meeting in Canada.Incidentally, the term “shock therapy” refers to the sudden release of price andcurrency controls combined with the withdrawal of state subsidies and immediatetrade liberalization within a country — all the necessary ingredients forimpoverishment of the society; in this case, Russia. Clearly, to theBilderbergers, Russia was the beginning of the end game.picture244 [images/picture244.jpg]The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupIn Zbigniew Brzezinski’s 1997 book The Grand Chessboard, “Russia” and “vitalenergy reserves,” as it turns out, are mentioned more frequently than any othercountry or subject in the book. According to Brzezinski, global U.S. and thusBilderberg hegemony depended on having complete control of Russia’s vital energyreserves in Central Asia. As long as Russia remained strong, it remained athreat — a potential block to the complete imposition of Bilderberg-led economicand military will. Bilderberg energy imperatives and geopolitical control areonce again coming to play a key role in the lives of hundreds of millions ofunsuspecting people.Brzezinski spelled out in The Grand Chessboard the compelling energy issuedriving American policy: “A power that dominates Eurasia would control two ofthe world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions. A mereglance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almostautomatically entail Africa’s subordination, rendering the Western Hemisphereand Oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world’s central continent. About 75percent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world’s physicalwealth is there as well, both in its enterprise and underneath its soil. Eurasiaaccounts for 60 percent of the world’s GNP and about three-fourth of the world’sknown energy resources.The history of mankind has always shown that controlling the heart of Eurasia isthe key to controlling the entire known world. Azerbaijan, containing the richesof the Caspian Sea Basin and Central Asia, is a case in point. From the U.S.perspective, the independence of the Central Asian states will be renderednearly meaningless if Azerbaijan becomes fully subordinated to Moscow’s control.To the Bilderbergers, energy imperatives are the end game.The energy theme appears again later in Brzezinski’s book, written four yearsbefore 9/11: “The world’s energy consumption is bound to vastly increase overthe next two or three decades. Estimates by the U.S. Department of Energyanticipate that world demand will rise by more than 50 percent between 1993 and2015, with the most significant increase in consumption occurring in the FarEast. The momentum of Asia s economic development is already generating massivepressures for the exploration and exploitation of new sources of energy.”3224. Brzezinski, Zbigniew, The Grand Chessboard: Americaan Primacy And ItsGeostrategic Imperatives, Basic Books, 1997Postscript — Bilderberg ReportsClearly, to the Bilderbergers, Russia was the beginning of the end game.Could the eventual dismemberment and weakening of Russia — to the point that itcould not oppose U.S. military operations that have now successfully securedcontrol of the oil and gas reserves in Central Asia — been part of amulti-decade plan for global domination? Most credible senior analysts seem tobelieve so.At a 1997 symposium held in Bonn, Germany, Dr. Sergei Glazyev, Chairman of theEconomic Policy Committee of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, made astark declaration: “This colonization, masked as reforms, destroyed the basicinstitutions of Russian society along the following basic lines: (1) destructionof the financial system of the state, by means of an endless buildup of thestate debt pyramid, shrinking of the tax base, deepening of the non-paymentscrisis, and disorganization of the monetary system; (2) destruction of thescientific and technological potential of the country, achieved by means of amany-fold reduction in state financing of science, the collapse of technologicalcooperation and scientific production integration in the course of massprivatization, and the refusal of the government to have any scientific andtechnical, industrial or structural policy at all; (3) sale of controlling blocsof shares in the leading and most valuable Russian firms, in industry, electricpower and telecommunications, to foreign companies; (4) Transfer of the right toexploit the most valuable Russian raw materials deposits to transnationalcorporations; (5) establishment of foreign control over the Russian stockexchange; (6) establishment of direct foreign control over the shaping ofRussian domestic and foreign economic policy.”^But, one Finnish delegate’s opinion that “no U.S.-Russia military confrontationis likely, no matter how tense things should get” is increasingly an unsafe oneas a more desperate U.S. pushes back against a much more aggressive Russia.Henry Kissinger added that “aggressive, unilateralist U.S. foreign policy hasforced ‘axis of evil’ states to accelerate their pursuit of nuclear weapons toimmunize themselves against U.S. military strikes.”Richard Perle pointed out that in response to aggressive U.S. tactics across theglobe, Russia has undertaken asymmetric steps to undermine the ability of theU.S. to project its military power effectively into5. Glazyev, Sergei, “From a Five-Year Plan ol Destruction to a Five-Year PlanoFColonisation,” EIR Bonn Symposium, 1997The True Story of the Bilderberg Grouptheir neighborhoods and into those of their partners and allies. When oneAmerican Bilderberger tried to object, European delegates brought up China’srecent response to U.S. intentions to weaponize space: a simple and relativelyinexpensive demonstration of a shoot-down of its satellite. The example producedsnickering in the room, much to the chagrin of the Americans.AfghanistanA nother subject under discussion was Afghanistan. It was commonly agreed by theattendees that the U.S.-led NATO alliance/mission was in a state of quagmire,and that “the situation in the country is getting worse.” The problem could bedefined, in the words of one British Bilderberger, as “one of unrealexpectations.” He went on to explain that the dichotomy of clamoring fordemocratic reform while simultaneously propping up Pashtun warlords withoutdelivering serious progress “has managed to discredit a lot of our basic notionsin the eyes of the Afghans.”Bilderbergers, however, aren’t the only ones left scratching their heads abouthow Western governments and their carefully chosen Afghan partners have managedto spend billions of dollars in development assistance with little to show forit. Catastrophe is good for business — always has been. Without suffering, therewould be no humanitarian assistance. And without humanitarian assistance, therewould be no room for undercover intelligence network operations as part ofWestern imperatives for geopolitical control.The worse it looked, the better it sold. While the American people were gettingtheir daily diet of ubiquitous images of repression, suffering and burka-cladAfghani women beamed into every living room, a propaganda campaign wassurreptitiously launched in the pages of newspapers and glossy magazines. TheNew York Times and the New Yorker were greasing the gears of the misery machineby urging the U.S. government, the United Nations and anyone who would listen to“do something —amid the jewelry advertisements. Terror and horror, likeexpensive jewelry, became commodities.Afghanistan and its African cousins of Sudan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Congo andRwanda, and the rest of the nations blessed with Western humanitarian help, arenow all basket cases. Bilderbergers seemed to bePostscript — Bilderberg Reportsasking key questions: How is it possible that humanitarian missions of suchscale and magnitude could have failed so miserably? Is it a case ofgood-intentioned exercises going bad due to corruption, greed and lack ofoversight? Or it is the merciless dismemberment of yet more foreign lands andcultures exercised stealthily through humanitarian aid agencies tied to thelarger apparatus of government?Furthermore, the U.S. government’s support for known Afghan drug warlords addsanother vital clue to the puzzle. The amount of profit generated annually by thedrug trade, according to the United Nations, is somewhere around $700 billion intax-free cash-flow per year. Seven hundred billion dollars a year is too muchmoney to hide in a sock. You need a lot of experience and expertise to movethose kinds of funds stealthily. Does anyone doubt that Afghanistan is aboutdrugs? Does anyone doubt that the CIA is involved?For example, the CIA financed the Muslim Brotherhood in 1977 and trained themujahedin in preparation for the campaign of collusion between Washington andright-wing Islam: the Afghan War. The roots of the Afghan conflict can be tracedto Al-Azhar Mosque in Cairo, the center of the Muslim Brotherhood’s activity.Shortly after the 9/11 attacks, alleged airline hijacker Mohammed Atta wasidentified as a Muslim Brother in several Western publications, such as theWashington Post (September 22, 2001), The Observer (September 23, 2001) andNewsweek (December 31, 2001). Other Muslim Brothers involved were Khalid SheikMohammed and Ramzi Yousef, who masterminded the 1993 bombing of the World TradeCenter. Osama bin Laden’s right-hand man, the Egyptian Ayman al-Zawahiri, isalso a lifelong member of the Brotherhood.Robert Dreyfuss, in his extremely important book Devil’s Game,^ explained itthus: “They returned to Afghanistan and formed a branch of the Brothers, theIslamic Society. Later, these same ‘professors,’ as they were known, would formthe backbone of the Afghan mujahedin who waged a U.S.-backed, decade-long waragainst the Soviet occupation. The three leading ‘professors’ were Abdul RasulSayyaf, Burhanuddin Rabbani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.” Sayyaf and Hekmatyar, twobig-time Pashtun drug traffickers and CIA assets, were backed by PakistaniIntelligence, as well as Pakistan’s own “branch” of the Brotherhood, and fundedby Saudi money.^6. Dreyfuss, Robert, Devil’s Game; How the United States Helped UnleashFundamentalist Islam, Henry Holt ik Co., New York, 2005The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupThere was yet another link between the Brotherhood and the Bilderberg Group. Inthe early 1980s, Bilderberger Michael Ledeen of the ultraconservative AmericanEnterprise Institute and Bilderberger Richard Perle used Hekmatyar as a posterboy of anti-Soviet resistance at the time when Hekmatyar was actively workingwith Hezb-i-Islami terrorists to undermine America’s influence in Afghanistan.During an animated discussion, one Italian asked if the U.S.-led NATO forces had“the will to stay the course,” perhaps recalling that, in the wake of the U.S.military siege of Tora Bora in December 2001, the commanding general. TommyFranks, reportedly said it was not his intention to “get embroiled in aSoviet-style long-term engagement as in the 1980s.”' In 2007, however, AmericanBilderbergers were pressuring NATO allies to provide larger troop contributionsto the cause.Henry Kissinger insisted that “the will” is lacking, and so “we must now beginto acknowledge our limits.” One European Royal wholeheartedly agreed withKissinger’s assessment of the lack of commitment and will, adding, “The choicesfacing us are very difficult.”A NATO representative categorically stated that the West has neither thepolitical intelligence nor the understanding to fight a protracted, decade-longcounterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan.7.

Successes have been many, but so have disappointments. Agroup of very determined freedom-loving citizens from across the globe hasforced the all-powerful Bilderbergers to take cover, to become more secretive,more paranoid, and henceforth less invisible. We have been joined in our fightby men and women from every Western and some Eastern European secret serviceagencies. Little happens in the corridors of power which is not almostimmediately relayed to us through our trusted contacts. We operate within thelaw, triple checking our sources, references and leads. This effort is far fromeasy. But when 1 weaken and grow tired of the sacrifice this struggle hasdemanded from me, 1 think of millions of people from around the world who havefought and died so that one day, we, the generations who have come in theirwake, can enjoy the privileges of liberty and the honest and decent pursuit ofhappiness their sacrifice has afforded us.There was a time, when down on my luck, angry and frustrated because no oneseemed to listen, to understand and to fathom the dark clouds gathering allaround us, I felt betrayed by society and took it very personally and very hard.1 wanted to run away, to be alone, to feel sorry for myself, and to blame therest of the world for the misdeeds of a criminal few. Then, I grew up. 1 thoughtof the families of the Israelis and Palestinians killed in an ever spirallingviolence of hatred whose lives have forever been destroyed by the unspeakableevil hatred represents. This hatred is not spontaneous.It has been masterfully imposed and managed from behind the scenes by theBilderberger/CFR/TC/Round Table/RIIA controllers, who are dragging the unwillingworld to its utter decimation. I thought of millions of crack babies born ininner-city ghettos and tens of millions of opiate addicts whose future has beenturned into drug addiction because a select few make a lot of money from themisfortunes of others.1 thought of the lies and deaths of hundreds of millions of innocent youngsoldiers who were sent by the slick propaganda campaigns to their demise atVerdun and every other engagement of WWI, WWII, Korea, Viet Nam, the Falklands,Panama, Afghanistan, Iraq, etc., etc., etc. I thought of Agent Orange and theGulf War syndrome responsible for turning strong young, square-shoulderedsoldiers into frail old men at the age of 30. 1 thought of the hundreds ofthousands dyings in the hrebombing of Dresden, unwitting “guinea pigs” in theTavistock instigated psychological warfare experiments.The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAnd I stand firm and determined with the ever-growing number of people worldwidewho have lost all faith in their governments, who are sick to their stomachs ofthe lies and the greed and the duplicity, the pantomime, the facetiousness andthe manipulation, by those who call themselves our “leaders.”Three hundred and seventy years ago, Galileo Galilei was persecuted for teachingthat the earth was a round planet that revolved around the sun. The CatholicChurch and much of the citizenry reviled the great man because they wereterrified that this truth would upset the social order. As someone has said,“The problem is people’s inherent unwillingness to face things of which they areafraid, thereby scapegoating and sacrificing their fellows to an evil they darenot confront themselves.”I live for the day and the hour in which men and women of honor will recognizethat dignity, kindness, integrity, trust, love of thy fellow beings are asindispensable to the survival of the human race as Galileo’s discoveries were.These principles of humanity should be enshrined on some document somewhere, sothat should a future despot decide to betray Humanity once again, he will paydearly for it.On the surface, this book is about a secretive Group known simply as theBilderbergers. On a much deeper level, however, it is about inner faith andconviction, which public opinion, bribery, lust for money and power cannotinfluence. This book is about the integrity and honor of many individuals. It isabout helping people learn to think, and stand independent in their thoughtseven from the so-called experts, masterfully represented by every major mediagroup who would tell them which conspiracy theory not to believe.This book is also about my life, about my refusing to live in fear. Until mydying breath, I shall live as a free man, walking the earth as a free man does,with my head held high. Only when we decide to let fear govern our actions willthose whom we oppose and despise truly won.Daniel Estulin September 22, 2007picture245 [images/picture245.jpg]Dr. Mary’s MonkeyHow the Unsolved Murder of a Doctor, a Secret Laboratory in New Orleans andCancer-Causing Monkey Viruses are Linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the fFKAssassination and Emerging Global EpidemicsBY Edward T.

Bydeciphering past, present, and future geopolitical events, it makes the casethat oil pricing and availability have a long history of being employed aseconomic weapons by the United States. Despite ample world supplies andreserves, high prices are now being used to try to rein in China—a reverse ofthe low-price strategy used in the 1980s to deprive the Soviets of hardcurrency. Far from conspiracy theory, the debate notes how the U.S. haspreviously used the oil majors, the Saudis, and market intervention to movemarkets-and shows how this is happening again.—Available in July 2008-Softcover $14.95 (ISBN 0977795390) • 240 Pages • Size: 5.5 x 8.5picture248 [images/picture248.jpg]Oil Cardpicture249 [images/picture249.jpg]Global Economic Warfare IN THE CenturyExpendable EliteOne Soldier*5 Journey into Covert WarfareBY Daniel Marvin , Foreword by Martha Raye A special operations perspective onthe Viet Nam War and the truth about a White House concerned with popularopinionThis true story of a special forces officer in Viet Nam in the mid-1960s exposesthe unique nature of the elite fighting force and how covert operations aredeveloped and often masked to permit—and even sponsor—assassination, outrightpurposeful killing of innocents, illegal use of force, and bizarre methods incombat operations.
