Where it went and whathappened are questions that snarl along the tattered edges of our fetteredcomplacency – while a profane oligarchy tugs us and our children along itsturbulent path of economic efficiency, sacrificing quaint ideas of personalfreedoms and liberties at the altar of “homeland” security, and “your papers,please.” Goodness, how did we get trapped in such a trite B-movie?Daniel Estulin told some of the how and why in his best-selling book, The TrueStory of the Bilderberg Group. With Shadow Masters he shines a light onscurrilous activity happening behind the curtains, exposing the tactics beingused to enthrall us, to divide us – to rule us.It is sad, but true: the people no longer rule. Our republic of, by and for thepeople has morphed into a rampant empire run by corporate overseers using everymeans, some sinister, to increase their power, profit, and prestige.Seeking to divorce us from our heritages, our institutions, our families and ourfaiths, sophisticated methods of propaganda and psychological warfare plussimple bald-faced lies have been deployed, ripping our social fabric intodisparate factional futility. There is honesty within each camp which soon getsdebased through rhetoric, creating cogs in the machinery of control – to becalled up on cue.Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safetydeserve neither Liberty nor Safety.— Ben Franklin, 1755As much as things change they stay the same. Here we are, in the formative yearsof the 21st century, almost 234 years since our country’s Declaration ofIndependence, and we are still fighting some of the same battles of liberty andfreedom. Many of our fellow citizens do not seem to notice or care, unaware ofour mutuality and the responsibilities that come entwined. As someone succinclystated, “Perfect slaves think they are free.” Again, the simple, straightforwardfact is negative, “we aren’t.” Our Republic has been subsumed by forces withinand beyond, leaving a beholden mediocracy built upon misery, tragedy andpoverty.Daniel Estulin shows that the Shadow Masters, in their quest for total control,construct sleight-of-hand misdirections, attracting our attention here andthere, while the underlying actions subvert nations, their people and theircommonwealth. From crisis to crisis, from one “Hitler” to the next, we have allbeen strung along, led to choose sides, which then shape our roles in this“drama of history.”The consolidation of the corporate press and its infiltration by intelligenceagencies brings us a world where the frauds and fabrications of spooks becomedaily fare for us mere mortal fish-wrapper readers, leaving us susceptible towhat they are selling.Little strokes fell great oaks.— Ben Franklin, 1757They say knowledge is power; it is also said that a little knowledge is adangerous thing. Learning of the duplicity of the world, are we willing to stepout of the comfortable cocoon of our reality when we find that the truth of thematter presents us with revelations beyond our understanding and lays at ourfeet responsibilities we care not to fathom or shoulder? Lately, we have runaway, diverted our eyes from what is done in our name. Tyrants and tyranny havealways been with us. Will we stand up and do what needs doing, or succumb to thevulgarities of the age?God helps them that help themselves.— Ben Franklin, 1757Shadow Masters shows us the tricks of the trade, how “they” will play the endsagainst the middle and back again. How the world stage is set to beguile oursensibilities, provoke the desired reaction and send us on our merry way. Itisn’t whether you will be amazed, astonished, disgusted or whatever, but whetheryou will use these reactions to question authority, act in our own bestinterests and revitalize our Republic … and then see if we can keep it.Onwards to the utmost of futures!Peace,Kris MilleganPublisherTrine DayJanuary 21, 2010"},{"pageContent":"Dedicated to all those who refuse to accept the spectacle of human misery andinjustice as part of the norm.To the next generation who with pride and confidence have fearlessly picked upthe mantle and accepted the challenge.We leave it in your hands.

In 1980, one week after mygrandmother died, we emigrated. Over three hundred years of documented familyhistory and tradition fit into three dilapidated suitcases and one wooden cratethat held our family’s most prized possession – my mother’s piano. By the time Iturned fifteen, I had lived in some of the grandest of Europe’s greatest capitalcities. First came Mozart’s Vienna, then Dante’s Florence and Gogol’s Rome, thenHugo’s Paris, then Canada, then again Florence, Europe’s first nation-state andthe epicenter of the Renaissance. Finally, Spain. Finally, I mean, in atemporary sort of way.In all, I lost a country, got two back, somehow managed to misplace a wife,found a better, acquired three languages, a trunk load of unimaginable fun,enough deprivation and attempts on my life to last several lifetimes, andnothing about me has remained the same except, I’m told, my laugh.The burly border guard hadn’t been laughing when he spoke to my dad: “Don’t comeback. We don’t want your kind.” My dad was a brave man who defended freedom ofspeech in a totalitarian country, but the irony of the goon’s comment was loston me at the time. The sound of the man’s voice and the look on my dad’s facestill pierces.“My poor child,” said one of my wealthy aunts the day we landed in Toronto. “Howterrible it must have been. All the things they took away from you.” She scannedmy meager possessions, satisfied that it must indeed have been terrible. “What’sthis?” She inquisitively picked up a small plastic jar filled with sand and heldit some distance away from her, examining it askance.“It’s sand, sand from the Baltic sea.”She pretended not to have heard. “Tell me, what do you miss most?… Thoseterrible people….”Spain, Sun, Sand. And as I bend to pick it up on the white sand beaches of Conilde la Frontera in Southern Spain, twenty-six years crumble between my fingers.To take my broken pieces of recollection entirely literally, however, would beto miss almost everything that matters about them.The sound of my aunt’s voice resonates in the deepest recesses of my memory.What do I miss most? Having my country taken away from me in the name ofwhatever “-ism” they wanted to legitimize and bestow upon me. The ubiquitous“they.” The Men behind the Curtain. The Shadow Masters. They took my countryaway from me while I was still a boy.“You are with us or you are with the terrorists.” The voice of another “borderguard,” an airport security screener, grabs my attention. It catches me offguard, but this time I know who I am, why I am here and where I am going.No, sirs, I am definitely not with the terrorists, and I will not allow you tocow me into becoming one of them. I am here to shine some light on theircriminal transgressions. I am on my side, now. And on the side of those who aretoo weak to resist the jackboots of the criminal few. Graham Greene said itbest: “A writer’s loyalty always changes, because the victims change.”I have been offered the chance to become rich beyond my wildest dreams. For thetrouble I have caused them over the years, I have literally been handed a blankcheck: “Fill in the amount you consider just, and the money is yours.” Out ofthe corner of my eye, I can see the familiar cocky expression. Oh, do I know itwell. The border guards had it when they grabbed my mother by the scruff of herneck and pushed her face-first through the doors of a third class carriage:“Brest-Vienna,” it said, and underneath, hand painted, “Jews and emigrants.”A crazy thought occurred to me. What if I write a one and add nine zeroes? Abillion dollars? I was tempted. A billion dollars. A powerful impulse pushed meto pick up the pen. The two emissaries shifted nervously.But what if they accept? A chill ran through me. What if they did? Thenwhat?There would be no turning back on the road to perdition.One of the emissaries impatiently looked at his watch. “What will it take you tounderstand, Mr. Estulin? You can’t win this war. You can only prolong theinevitable.” Silence. “Your decision, Mr. Estulin.” His voice was firm butcompletely devoid of anger. To them, this was obviously a business proposition.I thought of my dad, a proud man destroyed by a system that felt threatened byhis innocence.“How many zeroes is one’s freedom worth?” I asked.The more educated of the two emissaries wished me good day, handing me back thecheck. “You can keep this as a memento,” he said. The paper left in my hand wasobviously bogus, and not even a real bribe. In retrospect, I’m far more relievedthan insulted.To my mind, there are two ethical implications in this episode. One, relativelyfacile and slightly snobbish, is that evil is a form of vulgarity. The otherimplication is more important, and more difficult to find, because it takes usbeyond words. It is that evil, in all of its manifestations, should be literally“unspeakable.” If we need to debate, even in the name of freedom and democracy,the legitimacy of evil deeds like torture, as we are being asked to do … if wemust debate these things, we are already lost.“Why are you doing this?” my aunt asked me shortly before she died. With myinnocence lost, I somberly replied, “Because personal freedom is a moralimperative. Because universal corruption and abuse of power and privileges atthe deepest level of society must be exposed. Because I refuse to turn my backon inhumanity and violence.”If democracy is the rule of the people, then influential sinister cliques andsecret government agendas are inimical to democracy. Clandestine spheres ofinfluence within governments waging secret campaigns against the populaces mustbe fought with zealous determination, lest we wish to repeat the fatal errors ofthe not-so-distant past.“Daddy, what’s an empire?” my daughter asked me, tugging on my sleeve. “Is thisan empire?” Unsure of herself, she had pointed to the cover of my last book, TheTrue Story of the Bilderberg Group. I gave the sort of answer suited to a youngchild, but I thought something different.Yes, this is an empire with a capital “E,” but not like a Russian Empire orBritish Empire or American Empire. Rather, it is the Empire of the ShadowMasters, unheard and unseen by most, but whose activities have a powerful anddirect impact on our daily lives.The American Revolution was a nationalist revolt against the British Empire. Itwas born as a defiant rejection of the legitimacy of tyranny. What is the moralauthority of an empire? How can we establish it? Why is a regime of libertysuperior to the tyrannies that today oppress so much of the earth? To some theanswers to these questions may seem self-evident, but for far too many people,they are not.This in itself is evidence of the reach of the Shadow Masters.Daniel EstulinBangkok, ThailandDecember 21, 2009"},{"pageContent":"[images/00126.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Prologue [index_split_005.html#filepos8995]AN UNEXPECTEDINVITATIONThere is much in life that is commonplace, and there is also much that isunusual.Jesse Ventura is one of the most unusual characters one can ever hope to meet.He stands over 6-feet 6-inches, has a 60-inch chest, a bald pate, and a large,unruly mane pulled back into a ponytail. His eyes, warm and penetrating, haveseen too much violence in their time. Eyes that don’t give up their secrets tooeasily. He shuffles, rather than walks, and speaks slowly and deliberately in ahusky deep baritone made famous during his days as World Wrestling Federationannouncer. Before that he was a big-time wrestler, before that a Navy SEAL.After retiring from the circus of the square ring, he joined another circus,this time juggling roles as radio host, TV presenter, actor, best-selling authorand political commentator. His reputation as a straight-talker in the latterenterprise got him elected governor of the freethinking state of Minnesota in1998 as the Reform Party candidate, and both Democrats and Republicans soughtways to snag him as a candidate for higher office. He served out his four-yearterm without seeking re-election, and has continued in his various other rolessince.In early July 2009, I received an email from Jesse Ventura’s producers. Theywere working on a seven-part series on conspiracy theories and had become awareof my investigations of the Bilderberg Group:Mr. Estulin, I’m working on a television documentary about secret societies andwould like to speak with you about possibly participating. Former Governor JesseVentura will serve as the host of the show.My reply was short and to the point. I had no idea how much they knew aboutBilderberg, nor what angle they wanted to present it from, but several recentdevelopments and experiences, such as an unfortunate documentary titled NewWorld Order by See Think productions, made me wary of the real intentions ofanyone involved in “getting to the core” of a conspiracy, either big or small.“My general comment on the subject,” I wrote to Ventura’s people, “is thefollowing:The Bilderbergers were founded by circles associated with a former Nazi Partymember, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands (who resigned from the Nazi Party asa qualification for marrying the Dutch princess). It was an agency sponsored bythe Anglo-Dutch monarchy, under the explicit patronage of the British and Dutchroyal consorts. It a significant, and typical part of a network overlapping thesame financier interests associated with the same Synarchist Internationalconcert of financier interests that had been behind the installation of fascistregimes in Europe during the interval 1922-1945. Its activities have been in thedirection of sundry efforts attempting to establish a world-system ofinternational fascism under the mantle of “globalization.”It is a subject which is worth studying as part of any investigation of relatednetworks associated with various nasty developments of recent decades. I alwaysrecommend that people study it as a sociological phenomenon, rather than as aconspiratorial entity. That approach would be most profitable for enrichingone’s understanding of recent and current history, and would, at the same time,avoid the kind of narrow “conspiratorial” view which, by its simplistic outlook,obscures more than is actually discovered.By making my position known in writing, I thought to avoid the kinds of mistakesthat lead to “he said, she said” innuendoes, especially if things didn’t turnout the way they were supposed to.What I found encouraging in the producers’ approach was their genuine attempt toavoid the kind of errors that would discredit both the show and theparticipants. I told them that I would only get involved if I had theirguarantee that the crazies and the conspiracy nuts would be kept on a shortleash.My request took them by surprise.“Why is that, Daniel?” The man’s accent was Southern Californian, and his voicetold me that this man gave orders and wasn’t accustomed to taking direction. Hewould have to listen in this case though, if they wanted my participation andall the hard-won credibility that came with it for their show.“Because this is different, gentlemen. We are dealing with real people and realcrimes. Not to mention the unfortunate fact that the media use the epithet‘conspiracy theorist’ to discredit anyone who discusses the criminal activitiesof those real people. Well, I am proposing we take the ‘theory’ out of theconspiracy.”I have been doing this work for quite a while now. I had come to the attentionof Jesse Ventura and his producers because of my books and my speakingengagements in North America in 2007 and 2008.The Bilderberg Group were introduced to me one fateful day in 1992, when aRussian double-agent, hoping to use my grandfather’s old KGB connections to savehis skin, first told me about them. It was then the weirdest thing I had everexperienced. I am not blowing smoke. It was utterly weird.How would you feel when between a Caesar salad and a T-bone steak with mashedpotatoes, a man who carried a poison pen in his breast pocket and was proudlythe owner at least eighteen false passports, told you that Canada was about tobe deep-sixed, and Quebec, its French speaking province, was about to separate,because powerful men in the United States needed to balance their books; thatHenry Kissinger was a KGB agent; and that much (most?) of consensual political“reality” was really more like theatrics. (This episode is described in greaterdetail in The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.)I was 26 years old at the time. Young and confident. Too confident, in fact. Itseemed like an amusing experience. I watched this man talk and wondered whatreally went on in his mind. However, being a pragmatist, I thought I could putthese stories to good use. Literally.I was single and, being a pragmatist, I adopted them as my own. Suddenly, I wasthe man-in-the-middle, telling and retelling them to every beautiful woman I metin bars and dance floors. I became the secret agent, the James Bond without theBritish accent and sexy moves. The more I told them, the more I embellishedthem. Searching for irrefutable proof of Kissinger’s KGB status morphed into aquest to unearth documents from Kenya’s Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s. And soon.Then 1995 came, and Quebec was making very public moves to separate from therest of Canada. My adopted country was in turmoil and so was I. I thought backto my T-bone steak and mashed potatoes. To this strange and secretive man,Vladimir, who told me matter-of-factly how the entire political process wasgoing to play itself out… step by step, three years in advance.“Brian Mulroney [Canada’s then-Prime Minister] is their man,” he had said. “Hehas been set up to take the fall.”“They need to destroy the Progressive Conservative Party [Canada’s oldest Party]and will use the Liberals to push their agenda” He wiped his hands on thenapkin. Actually, he rubbed that poor napkin with such force that for a moment Ithought Vladimir would end up wearing its pink color.He then methodically described, to my utter disbelief, how a series of electoralsurprises would result in Liberal Party control of Parliament, with JeanChretien (the most hated man in Quebec) as Prime Minister. With the ProgressiveConservatives ousted, the role of prime opposition to the Liberals would beParti Québécois, the Nationalist Party of Quebec.“You are crazy! PQ is a regional party full of ardent nationalists, they havezero representation in English Canada. Why would Canadians elect them as themain opposition?”“They will split the vote among all the regional parties, while the entireprovince of French-speaking Quebec will vote en masse for the separatist block.”He turned around and signaled for a waiter.“I will have another plate of mashed potatoes and a steak, please.”“So, what do you suggest we do?” I remember asking him, tongue in cheek, after afew moments of silence, amused at the silly man in front of me.“It’s too late,” he told me as he pulled a toothpick out of pocket. “The piecesare already in place.”Less than six months after that fateful lunch, and less than four afterVladimir’s disappearance, the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada wasobliterated in the most one-sided elections in Canada’s history. Brian Mulroneytumbled into political limbo. From an overwhelming majority, his party was leftwith five seats. Jean Chretien, the Liberal Party leader, became the new PrimeMinister. Canada’s opposition party became Parti Québécois, with LucienBouchard, a member of the Bilderberg Group and David Rockefeller’s man inQuebec, as the official opposition leader, and with the biggest block ofseparatists ever. A right-wing western party, the Reform Party (no relation toJesse Ventura’s), became the third force in Ottawa’s Parliament.The 1995 Quebec referendum on its right to self-determination became front-pagenews across Canada. Cleverly manipulated emotions spilled from political arenasinto city and town halls, shopping centers, bars and restaurants, barbershopsand playgrounds.“Quebec is different. We are not Canada. We have the right to be a nation,” somewould say.“You want to go? Go! But don’t come back. Who will be your trading partner?France?”The Quebecois were saying “We are leaving!” And the rest of outraged andstage-managed Canada, with unsuspecting people manipulated from behind thescenes, were saying, “Go to Hell and don’t come back!” There were lies heapedupon lies.I think it is safe to say that the twentieth century will go down in history asthe most outstanding for the endless monotony of its popularly believed lies.The magic bullet that killed JFK, 9/11, WMDs in Iraq, artificial sweetener thatis good for you. The one I like the most is about Ana Nicole marrying that veryold, very rich man for love. On the other hand, I definitely know that strangerthings have happened.Fifteen years ago, I had to make a hard choice. To believe the man who told methree years earlier what was going to happen in Canada was to step through thelooking glass into a parallel universe of smoke and mirrors. I was afraid ofwhat I might find there. It also meant admitting to myself that the life Ithought I had led before that fateful day was a fiction. Of course, I could havecalled it coincidence, unwilling to contemplate its reality, instead retreatinginto a comfortable existence of nightly news and front-page stories.But I didn’t, and by 1996 I was working with others to expose the Bilderbergers’sinister plans for Canada during their annual meeting, which that year was, veryfortunately, held at an exclusive resort near Toronto. Because of our efforts,their meeting did make front-page news across Canada, igniting indignation, andthey were forced to put their plans for the North American Union on the backburner. (Again, a much fuller narrative of these events is given in The TrueStory of the Bilderberg Group.)Now, as I watch the world ride its way to Hell in a hand basket, wondering whyintelligent people who came to listen to my conferences and talks across Americadecided to ignore my warnings, I recall my initial reaction of disbelief atVladimir’s revelations. Sometimes the stories just seem too weird to be true.Events, however, frequently bear them out.To get the Jesse Ventura people and me in the same boat, it was vital topersuade those high-powered individuals to be open to the possibility that thiswas more than simply making a show and airing it on TrueTV. Bilderberg is not anisolated phenomenon, but a megaconspiracy spanning centuries. In fact, today’sBilderberg Group already existed in the early 1200s, right after the FourthCrusade. Then, they were called the Venetian Black Nobility. Today, there arestill Venetian Nobles, but they have gone underground and changed their outerlayer to an informal, private gathering of powerful people who have come to beknown as the Bilderberg Group, after the hotel where they first met back in1954, in Oosterbeek, in the Netherlands.“What would your approach be, Daniel?”I explained to them that the only way to make it credible was to explain from ahistorical perspective the underlying causes of the political events around us.The man on the other end was listening.“What separates true investigators from the flim-flam artists and theirconspiracy cousins is history. By putting Bilderberg in a historical context,you take the high ground away from the potential ‘debunkers.’”“Can you give me an example?”“Thomas Aquinas and the idea of ‘natural law,’” I replied.“All right, you’ve got me now.”“In the 13th century, Aquinas emphasized that there were natural laws underGod’s divine plan, laws which were knowable, and which would naturally lead toan ideal nation-state dedicated to the common good. In the next century theseideas were advanced by Dante Alighieri’s, De Monarchia Mundi and Nicolas ofCusa’s, Concordantia Catholica. For the first time, the idea is postulated thatthe important aspect of nobility is not a question of blood or title to land,but rather the necessity of ennobling the individual, a very important evolutionin the development of mankind.“Then,” I added, pre-empting their questions and impatience, “in the middle ofthe 15th century, the collapse of the Italian banking houses of Bardi andPeruzzi caused a chain-reaction breakdown of the productive economy. Thisdisintegration resulted from the sudden collapse of the worst financial bubbleof debt-speculation in history throwing Europe into virtual chaos, andshattering temporarily much of the oligarchic power of Venice and itsaccomplices.”“Daniel, what does it have to do with Bilderberg?” asked one of the men inCalifornia.“They are the current oligarchs, who have been battling the rise of republicsdedicated to the common good ever since. These liberal ideas gained the greatesttraction in England, with the rise of Parliamentary power. Then, again inresponse to royal tyranny, the idea of a representative democracy as the onlypractical way to defend the inalienable rights of the individual was formulatedin the American Declaration of Independence, and then in the US Constitution.“The fostering of scientific and technological progress was a mandate given tothe republic. Patents and copyrights are specifically mentioned in theConstitution. This was truly revolutionary, because commitment to these newinstitutions, even by a tiny minority within Europe and America, would changethe dynamics for all nations. All were compelled to adjust their behavior andadopt virtually every technological and scientific breakthrough, or they’d beleft behind by the winds of progress.“This is what is behind the ferocious conflict over the past 650 years betweenthe forces representing the Classical republican tradition of Solon, Socrates,Plato, and Leonardo da Vinci against the forces representing so-called‘Enlightenment,’ which is used as a mask for the one-world tyranny that theBilderbergers hope to engineer.“How’s that for historical perspective?”“Okay,” came their reply. “Yes, we can definitely work with you.”I must admit that even at this point, I still had my reservations. My family andI were moving to Southeast Asia, amongst other reasons because my book couldn’tbe really complete without an exclusive interview with the world’s most infamousgunrunner, who was residing in a Bangkok prison and awaiting action on a USgovernment extradition request. Furthermore, I was working against the deadestof deadlines on Shadow Masters. The timing was simply wrong.Everything seemed wrong. Something inside kept telling me to postpone or evenforgo the opportunity altogether. After all, I rationalized, there are hundredsof credible and not-so-credible people who would love to appear in anything withJesse Ventura. Let them have their spot in the limelight.The producers must have sensed my wavering, and increased their pressure tenfoldto get me to officially commit to the project. Indeed, too much was riding onit. If I backed out, I finally realized, the only winners would be DavidRockefeller and his Bilderberg cohorts. And that I simply could not accept.For close to ten years now, I have enjoyed privileged access to documents andinformation not only unavailable to civilians, but also to five-star generalsand most world leaders. I came to the United States twice on country-wide toursto promote The True Story of the Bilderberg Group, back in October 2007 and thenagain in the spring of 2008. From bookshops in New York City to book-signingevents in the Midwest and on the West Coast, I told people exactly what toexpect short term, what was going to happen and how.The economy, the housing market collapse, the presidential race, Iran, Iraq,Afghanistan, drugs, money laundering, Wall Street collapse, unemployment, oilprices, dollar destruction. Now it has happened. Unfortunately. I do mean it,because I would much rather be wrong than be right and have to witness aneconomic worldwide meltdown. I have said that consistently for many years. Isaid that the real Powers That Be would get their money out and safe before theycrashed everything. They did…. It was your money. It was our money.I specifically warned people that the day when they lost much of their wealthwould come much sooner than most people imagined. What prompted that alert wasunprecedented information I had received from my Bilderberg moles. If you don’tbelieve me, see my predictions that are recorded all over the Internet,including You Tube.When the financial system creates bubbles, it drives up the cost of assets farbeyond their worth. When the bubble bursts, the value of these assets plummet.Those with ready cash buy up everything.“Sell your homes, and do it immediately,” I said. “This is about to crash. Take10% off the top, and you will move your home in a week. Rent for a year or so.Then, if you are smart, you can buy back the same or better for half the price.”I said that back in 2006, shortly after the Bilderberger meeting in Kanata,Canada.“Yes, but…” replied most people.“Don’t forget about gold. It will jump from $900/oz to $1200.”“Yes, but … “In one of the Bilderberg reports from the mid-1990s I learned a terrifying newphrase: “demand destruction.” It took me until the year 2002 to understand itstrue meaning.“What do they mean by demand destruction?” I asked one of my Bilderbergconfidants in 2002.This person looked at me, deep in thought before replying with a question. “Howwould you destroy demand?”“War,” I replied instinctively.“Wars are expensive. Actually, it’s much easier than that.”“It is?”“You destroy the demand by destroying the world economy.”I opened my mouth, but a hand went up, pre-emptying my next question.“If you are worried about David Rockefeller losing his wealth, don’t,” was thesarcastic comment.I smiled and waited.“It is a simple transfer of wealth, just like the Great Depression. The peoplewill lose their homes, their equity, their savings and their real money.Somebody else will come in behind them and stealthily buy it all back forpennies.”From one perspective, their plans for demand destruction and economic cataclysmmake sense. Without the kind of intervention that the Shadow Masters havelaunched in the attempt to slow down the rates of economic growth, thenation-states whose commitment is to scientific and technological progress wouldbecome dominant. That would signify the death of oligarchy. It would mean theend of the Shadow Masters. Nations which foster the creative mental developmentof their population produce a people which will not tolerate oligarchic forms ofrule indefinitely. Illiterate, technologically and intellectually backwardpopulations will.In Portland, Oregon, at a standing-room-only auditorium, I had the temerity tolecture Americans, who had come out in droves to hear about the BilderbergGroup, on their own principles of government: “If people are to participate inself-government, they must participate in the ideas by which society isself-governed. Ignorant people, uninformed people, can not participatecompetently in selfgovernment: they do not know what the issues of governmentare. Indeed, for the African-American slaves of the nineteenth century UnitedStates, literacy was the first condition of freedom.”I remember an elderly woman asking me if literacy meant being able to read, orif it implied something on a deeper level. A good question.True literacy, you see, also refers to “cultural literacy,” a crucial element tofulfil the requirements of self-government, which is intimately interlocked withthe ideal of a nation-state republic. Nationstate republics stand for“commonwealth” and for the general welfare of the citizenry. For the common goodof future generations.Common wealth, the General Welfare of the population as stated in the Preambleto the Constitution of the United States. What is undertaken is the developmentof mankind, the development of the power of the individual, and of the nationwhich depends upon scientific progress. This increases the potential of theentire population.On the other hand, the Empire of money depends upon the suppression ofgeneralized scientific knowledge by keeping us backward and dumb. Of course,scientific knowledge that it can monopolize is another matter entirely. It iseasy to see the fault lines. Us and them. The struggle is between those of uswho want to develop human minds and those who don’t.AUGUST 12,2009 MADRID 11:57 A.M.The man behind the ticket counter punched something into his computer, waitedfor a split second, squinted, checked my passport again, pressed the deletebutton until my name was erased, held my Canadian passport to the light, checkedthe watermarks, as he had been taught to do, typed it in slowly for the secondtime and waited. Something was wrong. He smiled. It was the friendliest smile Ihave seen in a long time. I don’t get these as a rule, not from airlinerepresentatives or officials in uniform.“Just a moment, sir. I will be right back.”“Is something wrong?” I inquired, not being even remotely aware of what was instore for me.“No, no, everything is all right, Mr. Estulin. It’s just your name … I willcheck inside.”Yes, something was wrong, very wrong. I have been doing what I do, whatever itis that I do to piss people off, for too long a time not to recognise thetelltale signs. I checked my watch. It was midday. My flight was schedule todepart at one-twenty-five in the afternoon. Thank God I was on time, this timeat least. My usual manner of catching a flight is more like running after theairplane as it is taxiing to the runway and, what’s even more embarrassing,having the entire plane wait for me as I meekly walk down the aisle excusing mytardiness.“Mr. Estulin?” The voice belonged to a man who acted in the line of duty. Anofficial representative of the airline, accustomed to making hard decisionswhere the meek and the gullible and the braindead travellers are concerned.“You are looking at him.”He held my passport in his right hand, checked the seal on the cover, opened itto the corresponding page, looked at the photograph, and then at me.“My name is –”He gave me his name.“You are from –” He told me where I was from.“Look,” I told him. “I know who I am, and I certainly know where I am from. Doyou want an autograph and simply can’t find a way to ask me for one, or is therea problem with my passport, my face or my name?”The man cleared his throat.“Mr. Estulin,” he lowered his voice, “you appear on a certain list of people whoare not allowed entry into the United States. We are checking once more to makesure. I am aware of who you are. In fact, I have read your book. Veryinteresting, if I might add.” He clearly felt uncomfortable.“I have made several trips to the United States over the past year, and I didn’thave any problems getting into the country,” I replied, trying to put thesituation into perspective.“These are troubled times, sir,” he tried to reassure me in the most obtuse way.“Troubled? How do you mean?”“The War on Terror, sir.”“Don’t insult me, please.” I gave him my if-looks-could-kill stare. “I thoughtyou said you had read my book.”“Sir, as far as the United States regulations are concerned, the airline ispowerless to do anything,” he replied apologetically. “We simply must complywith whatever directives they issue.”“So, the directive to preclude me from boarding my New Yorkbound plane was madeby the United States government?”“We assume so, sir. The airline certainly has no reasons to keep you here.”“At what level?”“The computer doesn’t offer that information.”“How would the US government know I was travelling to the United States?” Iasked him.“We, sir, well, I mean, the regulations and the requirements of internationalco-oper–…”“Stop, please.” I cut him off. “So, the European Union has caved in to thedemands of the United States government, I asked him?”“What?”“Officially, the EU has categorically denied any inkling of the US government’saccess to European passenger lists.“Officially,” I repeated. “Unofficially, through several secret Europe-wideprograms coordinated with the United States and Canadian governments, thisinformation is available upon request.”Suddenly, it dawned on me. “All the right person needs to do is requestinformation on potential terrorist subjects. Does that mean the airlinewillingly provided my name to the US government without being asked to do so inthe first place?”A look of horror registered on the man’s face. He certainly knew who I was, hewas well aware of my reputation in Europe as a firstclass polemicist, knew thatmy books were read by millions, interviews and TV appearances were religiouslyfollowed by tens of thousands of zealous supporters. The idea of having allthese people picket their company’s offices on national television had crossedhis mind. He was being most deferential, on purpose.“Mr. Estulin, I cannot tell you more. You have to believe me. If I knew anythingelse, I would tell you. Even if I was forbidden by my airline, I would stilltell you.”I listened to the tone, the intonation, to the cadences of his voice. There wasa grumble in the man’s voice, but not a trace of dissembling or guile. He wastelling the truth. Those who tell the truth in ordinary conversation take it forgranted they will be believed. Liars, on the other hand, more often than notinstinctively look at you attentively after they speak, to see if you bought itor if they need to do more in order to persuade you. The airline representativetook it for granted.“What you people have done is illegal,” I said. The man didn’t reply.“The Dutch representative for the Green party in the European Parliament,Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg, stated on record that this type of action was aclear violation of existing European privacy laws on data protection,” I shotback, my jaws clenching.(However, Kathalijne Maria Buitenweg should know better. The EuropeanParliament, the only elected institution in the EU, is no more than an assembly,with no legal powers to initiate legislation: its sole legal recourse is to askthe Commission to do so. Moreover, the number of proposals is so large thatMembers have to vote on many with little or no knowledge of what they trulyinvolve. Debate is virtually non-existent, and the strict, five-minute timelimits favor most legislative proposals going through virtually unchallenged.The European Parliament has no control over moneys, nor can it impose taxes. Themoney supply is the domain of the synarchist-controlled European Central Bank,which orchestrated the 1922-1945 spread of fascism throughout much of Europe,and which exists today in the form of a network of private banking houses, suchas Lazard Frères.)“Mr. Estulin, you can lodge a complaint with your European representative.”Another lie, I thought to myself, not to mention a naïve way to try to unloadthis onto someone else.He was about to speak again, but I interrupted: “Remember that these fine peopledo not, in any way, represent your interests, but rather interests of asupra-European state, regions on earth and not independent countries. This wasmade sure through the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam in October 1997, whichremoved the border controls between EU states. The next step in the wholesaledismantling of independent nations comes in the form of the Nice Treaty. This isthe foundation that is about to strip us, the people of Europe, of our basicindividual human rights under the guise of a charter of fundamental rights.”For the record, EU Commissioners, all of whom, incidentally, have attendedBilderberg meetings in the past, campaign a great deal for the charter offundamental rights, supposedly enshrined in the European Constitution, toprotect all of its citizens from malice, until you read the fine print of theConstitution and realize that the only rights you are entitled to are the onesspecifically mentioned in the charter. What you shall never hear from thesemalignant people is that all rights, under article 51 of the EuropeanConstitution can be suspended if “the interests of the Union” so require.I watched with chagrin as my Air Europa plane taxied down the runway, waited itsturn and took off without me, veering due north, and then northeast when it wasout of the busy Madrid air corridor.Use the situation to your advantage, I thought to myself. Adapt and improvise. Icouldn’t be in New York on Wednesday, August 12 as planned, which meant thatJesse Ventura and his crew had to be alerted, plans altered or changed or, inthe worst-case scenario, cancelled altogether. A simple “no” from the airline incollusion with the United States government affected plans of at least twelvepeople.Temporarily, I promised myself. I will get to New York one way or another.I checked my electronic telephone directory, which has more than 500 names ofpeople I can call on in times of emergency. This was an emergency. Luckily, aformer journalist for La Razón, a national newspaper owned by the publisher ofthe Spanish edition of my Bilderberg book, had taken on a position as the USEmbassy’s press secretary. I looked up his phone number and dialed.August is the worst month for business in Spain, as the entire country is onholidays. Unlike Canada and the United States, Europeans get thirty vacationdays per year, plus national and regional holidays. In Spain, you can also addall the holidays of local and regional and provincial patron saints, not tomention people’s individual patron saints. No wonder Spaniards work on averageforty-three fewer days than the rest of Europeans, and two-and-a-half monthsless than North Americans.“Whatever it is, call me in three weeks,” came a blissfully lazy reply from theother end of the line.“Where are you?”“In your part of town?”“Andalucía?” I asked.“Very much so.”“Where?”“Conil.”“Christ, you are five minutes from my house!” I exclaimed, suddenly rememberingI was not there, but six-hundred miles north in Spain’s capital.“How about dinner tomorrow?” he asked.“I hope to be in New York tomorrow,” I replied.“Hope?”“I was denied access to my New York City-bound flight.” I waited.“Okay. If you wanted my attention, you have it,” he replied.I briefly explained to him what happened, emphasizing the responsibility of theUnited States government. No need to bring in a hapless guy from the airlinecompany. He was simply following orders.“What are you planning to do?” he asked, all traces of bliss erased from hisvoice.“I would like you to call the US Ambassador and tell him that unless I amallowed to board that plane tomorrow, I will be on every Spanish mainstream andUS alternative radio station talking about this incident. You can also tell himI will be back tomorrow at the ticket counter with a throng of Spanishjournalists from television, radio and the print press, who will bear witness towhat transpires. You tell him it will be more expedient for him, and whoevergives him orders, to let me be rather than to deny me access again.”“Give me one hour. I will call you back.”“Manuel,” I said. “You and I have known each other for some six years. Pleasetell the Ambassador …”“I know, I know” he interrupted me. “Dealing with you is like wrestling with apig. One might win, but one is going to get awfully dirty in the process.”“Exactly.”He hung up. There was little left to do but wait. Two in the afternoon in Madridwas eight in the morning in New York, and five in the early morning on the WestCoast. I left a message with the A. Smith & Co people and called the hotel tochange the reservation for the next day. The airline reservation would have towait. There were too many unknowns even to consider booking another ticket atthis point. As much as I hated to admit it, my bravado and grandstanding heldlittle water with the United States government in Washington. The mainstreampress made sure of that.Spain, however, was different. I knew I could count upon at least two- tothree-dozen friends in the mainstream national press to show up at the airport.I needed numbers to make a statement. Three journalists showing up wouldn’t cutit. I needed a sizable enough force present to threaten the bureaucrats intoaction.Nothing riles up a Spaniard more than seeing an underdog mistreated by someonein a position of power. In the underdog culture that is Spain, Cervantes and hisknight of sad countenance still ride strong. Seeing the images of someone whohad been done wrong on national television would force the Spanish Minister ofForeign Affairs into calling his American number, not out of duty, butnecessity. To cover their backs. With the European Elections scheduled for thefall, I knew that phone calls would be made, and throats would be cleared andexplanations requested. I was hoping that would be enough to sway someone’sopinion to my favor.Manuel called me back less than forty minutes later. “The Ambassador doesn’tknow what happened. He is out of the country, so the decision wouldn’t have beenhis to make.”I thought about it for a moment. We had booked the tickets at the last minute,as the production company had trouble balancing Governor Ventura’s schedule andmine.“All right, Manuel. Let’s say the Ambassador really didn’t know. Who did? Whocovers his back when he is away? Who is responsible for plausible deniability asfar as the high-ranking members of the Embassy in Madrid go?”“That’s above my pay grade. They don’t tell me much.”“But you shovel all their shit, don’t you?”“That I do. But not the good stuff.”He paused for a moment before adding, “I have been assured unofficially that youwon’t have any trouble should you decide to try again.”“I am trying again tomorrow, and I am bringing out the cavalry. Enjoy Conil dela Frontera.”AUGUST 13,2009 MADRID 11:30 A.M.The airline representative, a fifty-something man with red round cheeks, dressedentirely in company blue: blue-spatted, blue bow-tied, blue shoed, and with afashionable goatee and a long patch of black dyed hair brushed over a “baldspot” the size of the Grand Canyon. He stood at Air Europa’s reception desk, aglass of water in one hand, and a passenger manifest conveniently folded into atube of documents in the other.One of my companions spoke first. “My name is Pepe Arenzana. I am a senioreditor with ABC.” ABC is a conservative Spanish national newspaper.The representative leaned over to an associate, who looked over my shoulder,squinted, and then whispered something in his ear.“Do you know Mr. Estulin?” asked Pepe Arenzana, pointing in my direction.As if in a trance, the representative stared pensively at the surface of thetable, absently gripped the rolled-up documents, then raised his eyes, lookingfirst at his associate, who was obviously in shock, his impressions a blur, histhoughts suspended, then at Pepe and then at me, studying us individually, andthen collectively as a group. Cameras and flashlights were going off all aroundus. Inquisitive passengers tentatively craned their necks to see what famousfilm star was the center of all the attention.“Were you aware that Mr. Estulin was denied access to the airplane yesterday?”“Has the US government given the airline credible reasons for such exclusion?”came a question from somewhere behind me.“Does the US government consider Mr. Estulin a terrorist?”“Does Air Europa, a Spanish airline, consider Mr. Estulin a terrorist?” shouteda female voice to my left.In that fraction of a second, the airline representative’s countenance expressedboth unmistakable resignation and crystalline contempt. For me? For the system?For himself? For the United States government and their misguided zeal? Madness.The assistant who sat next to the official representative tried to take some ofthe heat off his boss. “We assure you that Mr. Estulin will be allowed to fly.”He tried to sound calm and collective. Except for his shifty eyes, his externaldemeanor was calm. “There is no problem with his visa,” he tried to assure sometwenty-plus reporters who had gathered around the airline’s stand.“Since when do Canadian citizens need visas to enter the United States?” shotback a journalist from Tiempo national magazine.“There has simply been a misunderstanding. We were led to believe …”If there is such a thing as baptism by fire, I thought to myself, the assistantwas getting the real treatment. Live and in real time. What better way to learnthe nuances of the trade? And once again, Daniel Estulin was at the center.“Why do you always have to be a skunk at every garden party?” my ex-wife hadasked me once, what now seems like centuries ago.“Because injustices, sweetheart,” I said rather self-righteously, “need to bepaid back in kind. That’s the only way, short of violence, that goons learn.”"},{"pageContent":"[images/00030.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER ONE [index_split_005.html#filepos9127]CONSPIRATORS [index_split_005.html#filepos9127]That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain …William Shakespeare, Hamlet, Act 1 Scene VINTO THE WILDERNESS OF MIRRORSBy chance the final touches to this book were made during the 20th anniversaryof the fall of the Berlin Wall in November of 1989. It didn’t actually fall,rather the East German authorities announced on November 9 that access to WestBerlin was open, and jubilant Berliners simply disassembled most of it over thenext days and weeks. Since then it has become emblematic of the end of the ColdWar and the beginning of the “post-history,” “unipolar” world touted by Americanneoconservatives. The benefits from removing the expense of the arms race andfrom the spread of Western capitalism and finance – the “peace dividend” – wouldlead inevitably to a new golden age, a New American Century. It wasn’t meant tobe.Beyond the significant specifics, the fundamental message of this book is thaton the world stage, things are rarely as they seem. Leaders meet at G-20meetings, national legislation is enacted, UN resolutions are passed, NATOforces are dispatched, and only rarely do the real reasons for these actionseven approximate their justifying rhetoric. Such is the reach of the ShadowMasters.At the time I watched the party in Berlin – for that is surely what went on –with as much pleasure as anyone who had experienced Communist rule firsthand.But my meeting with Vladimir was years ahead, and I took the events at facevalue: as a vindication for Ronaid Reagan’s carrot-and-stick approach to betterrelations with the USSR. It would not be long before the USSR was no more, andMuscovites would be partying like the Berliners, albeit on a tighter budget. Itseemed as if the wildly popular Boris Yeltsin would be leading ano-longer-belligerent Russia into a new age of free enterprise and progress. Itwasn’t meant to be.Instead, Yeltsin presided over years of decline and economic disaster, all thewhile himself clearly declining into a world of alcohol and illness. When heabruptly left office, naming the ex-KGB officer Vladimir Putin as his successor,Yeltsin was the most hated man in Russia. Yeltsin, who had sold off state assetsat bargain prices to oligarchs and foreign interests, was seen clearly as theWest’s stooge, and US-Russian relations have cooled considerably since.The answer to “what went wrong?” depends on who is asked. The Shadow Masters’answer is another question: “What’s not to like?” Their world of deceptionthrives on conflict, both real and imagined. They consistently play both endsagainst the middle, and vice versa.They relish a war in Afghanistan precisely because it can be sold to the publicsamong the “coalition of the willing” as the defense of Western civilizationagainst the forces of Islamo-Fascism, whatever that may be. In fact it appearsto be an occupation to protect and control the most lucrative drug trade in theworld while stationing powerful military forces on the high ground betweenAmerica’s potential rivals Russia and China. It has the added “benefit” offurther destabilizing the Indian subcontinent while appearing to threaten Iran.As I said, what’s not to like?Few Americans took much notice of the June 2001 formation of the ShanghaiCooperation Organization (SCO), a mutual security concord including Russia,China, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kirgizstan, and Tajikistan. The Shadow Mastersnoticed. The invasion of Afghanistan took place in less than six months. Aglance at any globe will show the immense swath of Eurasia that these six statescomprise. In an effort to gain greater influence, the SCO has granted observerstatus to Mongolia, India, Pakistan, and Iran, which applied for full membershipin March 2008. These ten nations together comprise over 25 percent of theworld’s land-mass and over 45 percent of its population. Among other activities,which have included military exercises, the SCO has stated its intent to curtailthe drug trade. Western dominance of Afghanistan is viewed as essential inlimiting the power of the SCO.However, the current global financial crisis, though largely engineered, doesprovide an opportunity for more and more people to see through the veil ofdeception. This is particularly true outside the US, a phenomenon discussed byF. William Engdahl by way of an ancient Chinese concept:The problem for the US power elites around Wall Street and in Washington is thefact that they are now in the deepest financial crisis in their history. Thatcrisis is clear to the entire world and the world is acting on a basis ofself-survival. The US elites have lost what in Chinese imperial history is knownas the Mandate of Heaven. That mandate is given a ruler or ruling elite providedthey rule their people justly and fairly. When they rule tyrannically and asdespots, oppressing and abusing their people, they lose that Mandate of Heaven.If the powerful private wealthy elites that have controlled essential USfinancial and foreign policy for most of the past century or more ever had a“mandate of Heaven” they clearly have lost it. The domestic developments towardscreation of an abusive police state with deprivation of Constitutional rights toits citizens, the arbitrary exercise of power by non elected officials such asTreasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and now Tim Geithner, stealing trilliondollar sums from taxpayers without their consent in order to bailout thebankrupt biggest Wall Street banks, banks deemed “Too Big To Fail,” this alldemonstrates to the world they have lost the mandate.In this situation, the US power elites are increasingly desperate to maintaintheir control of a global parasitical empire, called deceptively by their mediamachine, “globalization.” To hold that dominance it is essential that they beable to break up any emerging cooperation in the economic, energy or militaryrealm between the two major powers of Eurasia that conceivably could pose achallenge to future US sole Superpower control – China in combination withRussia.1The world has discovered that risk has been globalized far more than eitherdemocracy or prosperity. The US bubbles in housing, banking and insurance haveled to economic ruin even among America’s traditional friends like Ireland andIceland. Their publics have been awakened by another type of “shock-therapy,”applied by the same culprits who used that as a justification for the “reforms”necessary to devastate the Russian economy.But again, none of this seemed likely, or even possible, when the Berlin Wallwas crumbling. It had been not yet thirty months since President Reagan hadissued his famous injunction during a speech in Berlin: “Mr. Gorbachev, teardown this Wall!” The irony was lost on me at the time, but if I had known in thewake of the Cold War’s end what I do now about spycraft, I would have noticed asignificant portent. November 9 marks the anniversary of a number of otherimportant watersheds in German history, to the extent that it is calledSchicksalstag, “Fate’s Day”: The 1848 Vienna arrest and execution of Germanliberal parliamentary leader Robert Blum, seen as symbolic of the failure of theRevolutions of that year in the German states. The 1919 abdication of the Kaisarand the declaration of both the Weimar Republic and a “Free Socialist Republic”in Berlin. The 1923 Munich Beer Hall Putsch, which failed but marked thebeginning of the rise of Adolph Hitler and the Nazis. The 1937 Krystallnachtrampage against the Jews, leaving well over one thousand dead and marking theonset of the full-blown Holocaust, which (ironically) helped lead to thecreation of the modern state of Israel.I also noted recently the 30th anniversary of the seizure of the Americanembassy in Tehran on November 4, 1979. The ongoing “hostage crisis” did morethan anything to discredit the Democratic Carter administration and usher in theReagan era, with its attendant Rea-ganomics, Iran-Contra, etc. Nearing thepresidential election of 1980, rumors began to swirl of an “October Surprise.”The Carter administration was negotiating for the release of the hostages beforethe election, with the very reasonable expectation that this would ensure thepresident’s reelection. It wasn’t meant to be, and Reagan was elected in alandslide on November 4, 1980, the first anniversary of the onset of the crisis.The hostages were released six minutes after Ronald Reagan was sworn in.The timing naturally raised a lot of eyebrows, and rumors now began to swirl ofsecret meetings with Iranian officials prior to the election by Reaganoperatives, most notably spymaster William Casey, Reagan’s campaign chief andhis future Director of Central Intelligence, and an ex-head of the CIA, then-VPcandidate George H.W. Bush. Charges and denials flared at various times viabooks and articles during the decade of the ’80s and beyond. In the wake ofpersistent Iran-Contra revelations that had for years been vigorously denied byadministration officials, a US House task force had been established toinvestigate the October Surprise story. By late 1992, with a new Democraticadministration on the horizon, it was evidently time for the outgoing leadershipto be exonerated, and the task force’s report was released on January 13, 1993,one week prior to Bill Clinton’s inauguration.Republicans then lauded it as complete vindication, especially after the taskforce’s Democratic co-chairman, Lee Hamilton (yes, the same Lee Hamilton of 9/11Commission and Iraq Study Group fame), provided the New York Times with an op-edpiece titled “Case Closed,” in which he recited the various “solid alibis” ofthe alleged evildoers. The powers-that-be were eager to apply the whitewash,lest the Reagan/Bush victory in 1980 be seen more as a coup d’etat than anelectoral triumph. It is now apparent that Hamilton knew better, and that thereport wasn’t worth the paper it was written on. But the disinformation campaignnonetheless succeeded, and subsequent revelations have never pierced the veil ofthe mainstream media.It turns out that Hamilton was withholding key information from the public. Inthe course of its investigation, the task force had in October requested theRussian government to supply any information it might have on the affair. Thethaw in US/Soviet relations now produced some inconvenient results. The Sovietreply was received on January 11, just two days before the reports already atthe printer’s were scheduled for dissemination.Based upon its extensive intelligence gathering, the Soviet report declaredunequivocally that both William Casey and G.H.W. Bush had met secretly withrepresentatives of Ayatollah Khomeini before the presidential election to urgedelaying the release of the hostages. It named specific individuals and providedthe specific locations in Paris and Madrid and dates. Also present, according tothe Soviet report, was Robert M. Gates. (Yes, that Robert Gates, who wouldbecome Director of Central Intelligence under George H.W. Bush and Secretary ofDefense under both George W. Bush and Barack Obama.) None of this informationwas made public, and the report was quietly buried among the task forcedocuments. To this day, the Russian report remains “classified,” and itscontents have never been officially released.It was discovered in 1994 among the stored raw documents of the task force by aWashington journalist, Robert Parry, who had broken a number of the Iran-Contrastories for the Associated Press and Newsweek. His 2004 book Secrecy andPrivilege: Rise of the Bush Dynasty from Watergate to Iraq discusses the matterin detail. A succinct account, including a discussion of the flimsy alibis,missing passports, etc. that provided the “rock solid” evidence of theprincipals’ innocence for the task force, is given by Parry in a recent Internetarticle, “The Crazy October Surprise Debunking,” for ConsortiumNews.2I am not suggesting that the Soviet report should be taken at face value; thatwould be naïve in the extreme. The point is that the information should havebeen investigated, not suppressed. And the fact that it was suppressed, and forthe most part exists “below the radar” of public awareness, illustrates the veryimportant fact that warfare in today’s world is primarily information warfare.Control of the very terms in which discussions are framed, and more so, even the“facts” which underpin the discussions, yields control of the outcomes of thosediscussions. The ritual drama of democratic process proceeds, while John andJane Q. Public haven’t a clue.This phenomenon is discussed in depth in another highly-recom-mended recentInternet article, “Beliefs: The Power Behind Unending War” by Jeff Gates forVeterans Today.3 Consider the following excerpts:In unconventional warfare, manipulated beliefs are used to displace inconvenientfacts. When waging war by way of deception, false beliefs are an oft-deployedweapon. Recall Iraqi weapons of mass destruction? Iraqi ties to al-Qaeda? Iraqimobile biological weapons laboratories?Iraqi meetings in Prague with al-Qaeda? Iraqi purchases of yellowcake uraniumfrom Niger? All these claims were reported as true. All were later proven falseor, worse, fabricated. Yet all were widely believed. Only the yellowcake uraniumwas conceded as bogus before the invasion of Iraq. As the US crafted itsresponse to the provocation of a mass murder on US soil, those widely sharedbeliefs shaped a consensus to wage war on a nation that had no hand in it….First and foremost are the consensus shapers and thought manipulators who targetperceptions and opinions until a critical mass of agreement is reached. Thencomes war. Those skilled at such duplicity induced coalition troops to war inIraq. Knowledge was their target. Manipulate thought and all else wasdownstream.Unconventional warfare is waged “upstream” with the assistance of those with themeans, motive and opportunity to massage consensus opinion. Where are modern-daybattles fought? Not on the ground nor in the air nor on the seas.The mindset is the primary theater of operations. The first battlefield is thepublic’s shared field of consciousness. The death and destruction come later.Deceit is not new to warfare. What’s new is the reach of thetechnologies–including modern media technologies–that now enable deception on aglobal scaleJeff Gates outlines how American neoconservatives manipulated public opiniontoward war through such organs as the Council on Foreign Relations’ journalForeign Affairs, where “The Clash of Civilizations” theme first appeared in anarticle in 1993. By the time it appeared in book form in 1996, Gates maintains,over one hundred non-government organizations (NGOs) were on board to promoteit.But again, Gates’ more general point is the one to keep in mind.When waging [information] field-based warfare, timing is everything. That’sparticularly the case when, as here, a belief-manipulating adversary is facedwith the greatest danger of its six-decade life: facts that conflict with thenarrative required to sustain The Clash storyline. …With consensus beliefs the upstream target, democracy becomes the downstreamcasualty. When manipulated beliefs displace facts, the rule of law degeneratesinto a faith-based parody of self-governance. To protect the informed consentessential to freedom requires that those waging war on the public’s sharedmindset become transparent so that those complicit can be made apparent.As I said, in the world of geopolitics, things are rarely as they seem. Thiswill become more apparent as the narrative proceeds.WHO KILLED LITVINENKO?On November 1, 2006, London became the site of the world’s first nuclearterrorist poisoning. The former KGB agent, Alexander Litvinenko, a majorconspiracy theorist, was poisoned with radioactive polonium. He had launched abarrage of damning accusations at the KGB’s successor, the Russian FederalSecurity Bureau: It had masterminded 9-11 … was an accomplice in the Danishcartoons mocking Muhammad … was directly implicated in a series of Moscowapartment block bombings in 1999 that killed more than 300 people … and the 7/7London train bombings of 2005 … and the 1999 shooting in the Armenianparliament… and so on and so forth. The former-Soviet/Russian intelligenceservice, by Litvinenko’s account, was the guiding force behind most worldtroublemakers, especially Carlos the Jackal, Yassar Arafat, and Aymanal-Zawahiri.4 On his deathbed, Litvinenko pointed his accusatory finger squarelyat Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian intelligence network.5The western media was rabid in proclaiming that Putin had ordered the poisonoushit, even though there was not a shred of evidence implicating the Russianstate. To me, none of it made sense. Putin would have to be mad to make such anattack. Litvinenko’s demise initiated a tsunami of Russophobic hysteria. Howwould Putin benefit from such massive antagonism? And why choose the highlyunusual method of eliminating a target with polonium 210? It’s a highlyradioactive and very rare metal, about 250 million times more toxic thancyanide, and its production requires a nuclear reactor to bombard the elementbismuth with neutrons.I recalled the words of a former US ambassador to the Republic of Seychelles,David Fischer: “The whole game of intelligence is called a wilderness ofmirrors. You look at it, but what you see isn’t reality, it’s always changing.”I had a feeling that none of what I was seeing was real.What looked like a clean and simple narrative, a morality tale pitting a heroic“human rights” crusader and former KGB agent against a tyrannical leader ofRussia – a rough nation of lawlessness and corruption doomed to imprisonment byits bloody past – has, on closer examination, turned into something quitedifferent, and far more complex. Again, why would the President of Russia, atthe peak of his popularity and awash in oil revenues, risk a breach with everyWestern nation by ordering the protracted public murder of a man who, at worst,was a nuisance to the regime?Was this a concerted attempt to discredit Putin’s administration? After all,according to Zbigniew Brzezinski’s assessment, an independent Russia stood inthe way of America’s plans for global hegemony. The grand strategy of theneoconservatives was revealed in a leaked 1990s Pentagon document written byBilderberg Group attendee, Paul Wolfowitz. It too identified Russia as thebiggest future threat to US global designs.Though Putin allowed the expansion of American influence in former Sovietrepublics, the Russian president’s limited efforts to defend his country’sinterests evidently irked America’s new imperialists. Bruce P. Jackson, directorof the neocon Project for a New American Century (PNAC), wrote in 2003 thatPutin’s partial renationalization of energy companies was a threat to what hecalled the “democratic objectives” of the west.6With Litvinenko withering and wilting away in pain and anguish in front ofmillions of television viewers, I kept asking myself a single question: Whowould benefit most from his dramatic demise? Although the Cold War was over, itseemed the wilderness of mirrors stretched on.There were a number of individuals, organizations and countries, I thought, whowould benefit greatly from Putin’s removal: big western oil companies barredfrom an unimpeded access to Russia’s energy reserves; former and now expelled orjailed oligarchs who looted the Russian economy and stashed the stolen billionsabroad, men such as Boris Berezovsky, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Leonid Nevzlin;7Chechen “freedom fighters” and their supporters in the American Committee forPeace in Chechnya (ACPC). The list of the distinguished individuals supportingthat organization is a who’s-who of conservative America.Supporters of the ACPC include Zbigniew Brzezinski, the architect of the “GrandStrategy” against Russian interests in Central Asia; Alexander Haig, former USSecretary of State and a close confidant of KLA terrorist Hashim Thaci, thecurrent prime minister of Kosovo; Richard Perle, US representative of apro-Israeli lobby; Kenneth Adelman, the former US ambassador to the UN whoeagerly supported the Iraq invasion; Michael Ledeen, of the right-wing AmericanEnterprise Institute and a former admirer of Italian fascism; and James Woolsey,the former CIA director and a leading advocate of remodelling the Muslim worldalong pro-US lines.8One of the connections between Chechnya and the American Committee for Peace inChechnya is oil, involving a powerful interplay of economic, political andstrategic interests. Chechnya and Georgia share a border, and Georgia, likeRussia’s big neighbor Ukraine, is on the fast track to join NATO. “There arehundreds of US troops in Georgia, training the local forces,” explains renownedand well-respected political analyst John Laughland in the investigative journalGlobal Research. “They are there for two reasons: first, to protect the US-builtBaku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline; secondly – and this follows from the first – toassist Georgia in recuperating its two secessionist territories, South Ossetiaand Abkhazia.”9For the ACPC principals, it will not do to have Russia anywhere close to thepipeline, and it has troops in both those areas. Pushing Russia out of theCaucasus, as Brzezinski outlined in his revealing 1997 book, The GrandChessboard: American Primacy and its Geostrategic Imperatives, requires victoryfor the Chechens. An independent Chechnya may also be the prelude to thelong-term breakup of Russia itself; after all, the CIA predicted that oil-richSiberia might escape Moscow’s control in its Global Trend 2015 report.10These strategic interests were further supported by, and are interlocked with,the private interests of powerful people lobbying for this anti-Putin policy.They included people like David Owen, representative in London of now-defunctRussian oil conglomerate Yukos, along with Henry Kissinger and Jacob Rothschild,members of the board of Open Russia Foundation, a Yukos front. Cheap oil is amatter of life and death for the US. Maintaining its dominance in a unipolarworld, especially in monetary matters, is also considered absolutely essential.Putin’s Russia stands in the way of both of these imperatives.But these suppositions distract from the real reason for Litvinenko’s murder: hehad joined with the Russian oligarchs in a bid to retake the Kremlin after theirexpulsion by Putin.Boris Berezovsky, who is wanted in Russia on charges of murder, extortion, andmassive theft, had taken Litvinenko under his wing. He found Litvinenko useful,and thus posthumously published Lit-vinenko’s book blaming Putin for practicallyevery ill under the sun.11In 1998, Litvinenko had called a press conference. In it he claimed that a yearprior he had been given instructions by a high Russian security official to killBerezovsky. The press conference was one of the strangest things I have everwitnessed. With other members of his unit beside him, one sporting a blackbalaclava, Litvenenko said his refusal to carry out the hit led to violentthreats from his superiors. Still, as the Guardian of London put it in anobituary article, “The truth of the accusation would remain disputed. Criticssaid it was fabricated to help Berezovsky blacken enemies in the FSB [FederalSecurity Bureau]. Litvinenko claimed it was just one manifestation of thecorruption and violence inside the FSB that he wanted to expose.”12Investigative journalist, Oleg Sultanov, who allowed himself to be “recruited”by the Berezovsky network-in-exile, was commissioned by the oligarch to write abook on Putin’s Russia, with the one requirement that it must be “as scary aspossible.” Says Sultanov, “It was meant to be some kind of ‘foundation study’ ofthe horrors of contemporary Russia and the criminal role of the specialservices.” The core of Berezovsky’s theory was “the special services, and Putinthe former KGB agent, are responsible for everything that’s happening in Russia– all the contract murders, terrorist attacks, frauds.” Litvinenko’s books hadbeen a flop,13 so Berezovsky, says Sultanov, “urgently needed to create some hotnew reading material, which would prove Berezovsky’s case was just and Putin wasthe enemy of the human race.”14When Sultanov turned out to be an undercover investigative journalist,Berezovsky decided that he needed another approach. He contracted the servicesof a security firm called RISC, (formerly known as ISC Global UK). According toindependent British journalist Martin Kelly in his December 12, 2006 blog,documents seen by the Sunday Times of London, confirmed that the firm worked onplans in 2003 for a worldwide operation to “discredit Putin and those aroundhim…. Clearly, the best possible outcome would be for Putin to be removed frompower at the earliest opportunity.”Everyone is assuming, I thought to myself, that the Russian government wasbehind Litvinenko’s assassination. But this was too easy and extremelycounterproductive. There were several alternative theories to the “KGB agentPutin and his old-buddy goons doing it” scenario.Some surmised that a rogue element of Russian intelligence or some other part ofthe military-security apparatus did it out of revenge, or as part of thestruggle for power in the post-Putin government. The problem with this theory isthat there is no evidence for it whatsoever, and one should not work withsuppositions that do not meet the rigorous test of investigative journalism.Furthermore, it is very improbable that something of this magnitude and planningwould go undetected for very long. And certainly, the only people who wouldbenefit from Litvinenko’s assassination would be those seeking to underminePutin’s legacy and his chosen successor.Others suggested that Ahmed Zakayev, Berezovsky’s right hand man did it. But theTimes of London seemed to indicate otherwise: “On the morning of November 1,Litvinenko was given a lift by Zakayev into the center of London by car. Zakayevis a close associate of Berezovsky and considers himself the Chechen’s ‘ForeignMinister’ in exile. However, no trace of polonium was found in that vehicle – anindicator that Litvinenko had not yet been poisoned. Given the high radiation hesuffered, he would have fallen ill rapidly. ‘It would have been within hours, aday at most,’ said a source at the Health Protection Agency (HPA). It was theevening of November 1 that he first became sick.15There were claims that ex-KGB cadres Andrei Lugovoi, Dmitri Kovtun andVyachenslav Sokolenko, who met Litvinenko hours before he fell ill, poisonedhim. There is nothing remarkable to tell about the lives of former KGB agentsKovtun and Sokolenko. Andrei Lugovoi, however, is another matter. He is both aformer KGB agent and a former bodyguard to Yegor Gaidar, once Russia’s PrimeMinister in the pre-Putin days, and has also been in charge of personal safetyfor the President’s administration Head, Sergey Filatov, and of the Minister ofForeign Affairs, Andrei Kozirev.His story was not difficult to track down. Lugovoi became frontpage news inRussia in connection with the escape from custody of former national airlineAeroflot chairman Nokolai Glushkov, jailed on charges of money laundering.Glushkov and several others were charged with stealing over $252 million ofAeroflot’s cash and depositing it in Swiss accounts. To whom did the Swissaccounts belong to? To Boris Berezovsky.After Glushkov was incarcerated, Lugovoi, the prison’s warden, helped him escapeto neighboring Georgia, a favored destination for Russian Mafia on the run.Lugovoi’s role became known when he was compromised by phone calls overheard bythe FSB while investigating Glushkov’s role in the crime.There was something else about Lugovoi’s past that caught my attention. He andLitvinenko both worked in the 1990s in a private security service for BorisBerezovsky.16 You might want to call it another coincidence, but one ofLugovoi’s clients at the time was Badri Patarkatsishvili, Georgian oligarch andlongtime associate of Berezovsky. A small world, indeed. Patarkatsishvili wasfound dead in February 2008 at his English manor house, of an apparent heartattack, at a ripe old age of 52. His personal detail counted over 120bodyguards.Let’s see. Glushkov is Berezovsky’s protégé. Glushkov is jailed for laundering$252 million of Aeroflot’s money. Lugovoi helps Glushkov escape. Lugovoi isjailed, but released. If Lugovoi had anything to do with Litvinenko’s murder,then the assassination dressed up to look like a KGB hit was far more likely tohave been a Berezovsky job than one of Putin’s.And how does one explain the rather expensive method used to eliminateLitvinenko? Berezovsky is a multi-billionaire. His estimated fortune is believedto be some $3 billion. With this kind of money, he would have had enoughresources to procure the polonium, hire the assassins, and make it look like acucumber-eating-KGB-goons-did-it job.A peripheral look at some of the other minor characters in the story line netsan entire platoon of former KGB types. One of them is Oleg Gordievsky, thehighest ranking KGB officer to escape from Mother Russia. He is under theprotection of British MI6. Another is Michael Trepashkin, arrested in 2003 andcharged with divulging state secrets to British intelligence. From his jailcell, he claims to know everything about Litvinenko’s death and to have vitalinformation for investigators. A May 19, 2004 Moscow News story reported thatTrepashkin, Litvinenko and Berezovsky are old friends.17Another player is Yuri Shvets, a former KGB major who in 2002 landed a $400,000contract from Berezovsky to transcribe a set of audiotapes that appeared toimplicate then-Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma in the killing of journalistHeorhiy Gongadze and in sanctions-busting arms deals. Then there is YevgeniLimarev, to whom Alex Goldfarb said he gave a $15,000 grant in 2002 for runningan anti-FSB website. Goldfarb is the executive director of the InternationalFoundation for Civil Liberties, established by Russian oligarch-in-exile BorisBerezovsky. Goldfarb presides over the information flow coming out of theBerezovsky camp. According to Goldfarb’s himself, he also has links to the CIAand the State Department.So, I thought to myself, Putin does not preside over this mysterious web offormer KGB operatives: Berezovsky does. Virtually all of the suspects in theLitvinenko murder are somehow tied to Berezovsky. The principals Litvinenko metwith the day he became sick are all stridently anti-Putin. The common thread isexiled oligarch Boris Berezovsky, who by his own admission is on a campaign todiscredit Putin and the Kremlin.I examined Litvinenko’s movements on November 1, 2006, the day he fell ill. Oneof the visits made by Litvinenko was to the security firms Erinys and TitonInternational, which shared offices. We are told that the occasion ofLitvinenko’s visit was to see a “friend,” but I wonder if it really was just asocial call. On the day he was effectively killed, Litvinenko paid a visit tothe world headquarters of a major mercenary operation actively involved insecurity for oil infrastructure in Iraq. Given the brief interval it would takefor Litvinenko’s poisoning symptoms to appear, one must ask when precisely thisvisit occurred. The timing could be a coincidence, but then again …In SourceWatch, I found a detailed description of Erinys’ operations. Thecompany was established by a pair of ex-Apartheid-era intelligence officials,Sean Cleary and Jonathan Garratt. Cleary was closely linked to Jonas Savimbi,the leader of the UNITA rebel movement in Angola. After reviewing some of thepress clippings about Erinys’ Iraq operation, I found a reference to a certainFrancois Strydom, who was killed in action. I knew Strydom personally, andbelieve me, he was someone you would wish to avoid at any hour of the day ornight. He had been a member of Koevoet, a known brutal counter-insurgency arm ofthe South African military active in Namibia during that nation’s fight forindependence from South Africa. To say he was right-wing would be a significantunderstatement.Both Erinys and Titon International are headed by the same CEO. Titon claims tobe engaged in confidential computer forensic investigation, whatever that is.What caught my attention is its logo – an iceberg floating in the sea, with thegreat mass of it underwater and only a tip jutting through the surface. Mightthis imply that much of Titon’s clout is unseen?I found myself thinking back to one of the more startling anomalies surrounding9/11: Many of the clues lead in the direction of Saudi Arabia and itsuninhibited support for jihadist terrorist networks, but some links also lead inan opposite direction, towards Israel. One such link was unexpectedly confirmedby the Washington Post in its reporting on the counterfeiting of US $100 billsby a South Ossetia-based organized crime ring operating with Russian-Israelimobsters based in the Republic of Georgia and Israel: On October 27, 2004, acourier for the counterfeit ring, Hazki Hen, met with an undercover SecretService agent at a hotel in Linthicum, Maryland, near Baltimore- WashingtonInternational Airport. Hen, who had just arrived from Tel Aviv, offered toexchange $230,000 in counterfeit $100 notes for $80,000 in real currency. Healso discussed the potential of delivering as much as $100 million oncounterfeit bills in the future. Hen was finally charged by the US government inNovember 2005.18The same linkage is seen with al-Qaeda financier Yehuda Abraham, a US-Israelidiamond dealer who was laundering money for the Russian-Israeli mob and aMalaysian linked to al-Qaeda affiliate Jemaah Islamiya; Asher Karni, a SouthAfrican-Israeli who was shipping nuclear triggers from the US to the AQ Khannetwork in Pakistan; and various Israeli spies caught around sensitive USfacilities posing as art students, movers and tourists prior to 9/11.What do avidly pro-Israel neocons and radical Islamists have in common? Hatredof Putin and his Russian nationalism. According to one commentator, “Putin ishated by Western elites, not because he aspires to be a dictator, but because heis defiant in the face of an all-out assault. He destroyed the power of theRussian oligarchs,”19 and, with it, the unadulterated, in-your-face theft anddestruction of his country.The prejudices of the media lead us down one path, signalling Putin and the KGBas scary nuclear murderers, but the facts, at least as they are known to me,take us down quite another. The Times of London’s suppression of Litvinenko’sconversion to Islam is a case in point. According to the Times’ paralleluniverse of smoke and mirrors: “Litvinenko was a loyal servant of the state .who grew disillusioned with the corruption of the FSB.”20Yes, and I am a cucumber. Litvinenko’s career at the FSB was dead onceBerezovsky, his krysha (Russian Mafia slang for “roof and protection”), wasforcibly removed from shaping the government’s gangster capitalism. One thing iscertain in Litvinenko’s case: he wasn’t killed for something he knew and wasabout to reveal. Berezovsky invested a lot of money over a five-year period intoLitvinenko’s “sensationalist” accusations. The results, to say the least, wereunderwhelming. Alex Goldfarb, Berezovsky’s right-hand man, clearly stated thatwhen Litvinenko tried to run to the United States, he had nothing to offer interms of information in exchange for settlement of his immigration case. Onlythe UK was willing to take him unconditionally, thanks in large part to thepersonal intervention provided by MI6’s Director of Security and PoliticalAffairs, John Scarlett. He had wrongly assumed that “Litvinenko would be able tofill in the gaps, and details in Vasili Mitrokhin’s KGB Archive which he hadbeen instrumental in bringing to Britain, especially more information aboutunidentified Soviet spies.”21* * *Another possibility in the murder of Litvinenko, although it first seemed quiteremote, was the involvement of the Italian “academic” Mario Scaramella, who hasbeen acquainted with dead Russians since 2002. Scaramella is one of those goofycharacters that populate the outer rings of the lunatic fringe of would-bespies. He has claimed to hold a professorship at the University of Naples; theUniversity apparently has never heard of him. He was caught on tape braggingthat Silvio Berlusconi, the once- and future-Italian Prime Minister, wasconsidering him for a top job at an unnamed international organization. He lateradmitted they had never even met.This history requires that his claims be accorded an extra degree of scepticism.Nonetheless, in an interview with the Independent shortly after the poisoningbecame public, Mario Scaramella said that Litvinenko told him he hadmasterminded the smuggling of radioactive material to Zurich in 2000. Was thismere bragging? Or was Scaramella in a position where an operative likeLitvinenko would be willing to divulge this information? Or might they havesimply been swapping “war stories”?One of Scaramella’s chief tormentors has been the wonderful Italian periodical,La Repubblica, one of Europe’s best sources for hardnosed investigativejournalism. Throughout the Litvinenko affair, I compiled quite a collection ofits articles. One of them specifically discussed a January 25, 2006 conversationbetween Mario Scaramella and a mysterious ex-CIA agent from California, named“Perry.” In the conversation, Scaramella stressed to Perry that his activitieswere not “just my activities, but the activity of the organization.” Whatorganization? I jotted down my question and pinned it to the Litvinenko puzzleboard.The latter portions of the conversation were even more revealing. Scaramelladiscussed political “dirty tricks” against his opponents, who included thecampaigning center-left Prime Minister Romano Prodi. The conversation made clearthat Perry gave Scaramella his orders. When Scaramella went off on a tangentabout his international activities, Perry merely replied, “You must work on theItalian politics.” When Scaramella presented a list of the possible futureoptions open to him, Perry very curtly suggested, “You could be part of thecabinet of the minister [Berlusconi].” But Scaramella was pessimistic: “Mostprobably Prodi will win, even if we will launch our attack.”But what did Scaramella mean by launching an attack? Was it a political attack,a personal attack, a dirty-tricks operation? What if, by “our attack,” he wasreferring to an attack for geopolitical gain, like the 3/11 (2004) train bombingin Madrid or the 9/11 attack in the United States? Could the deeper links of theScaramella-Litvinenko affair have to do with a dirty-bomb plot gone awry, whichthe Russian intelligence services may have actually derailed?Something else in the transcript drew my attention. La Repubblica was reportingthat, while talking to Perry, Scaramella declared that he had obtained tapedtestimony against Prodi from Oleg Gordievski, the highest-ranking officer tohave ever defected from the KGB, and that the testimony was given in thepresence of Lou Palombo. Who was this person, evidently involved in the reportedattempt to tarnish Prodi?I checked the Italian press for clues. According to La Stampa and La Repubblica,Louis F. Palombo was a 22-year veteran of the CIA and a managing partner ofFlorida-based Incident Management Group (IMG). Palombo’s biography at the IMGwebsite stated that, in 1977, he had founded the security consulting firmAckerman & Palombo. I scanned the list of IMG partners. They included DanielDonohue, a former CIA clandestine services agent in Southeast Asia and India;Harley Stock, a “forensic hypnosis” expert with the FBI and US Secret Service;and perhaps most intriguing, Christopher Hagon, a 21-year veteran of the LondonMetropolitan Police, better known as “Scotland Yard.”Hagon told La Stampa that another individual associated with IMG is FilippoMarino. The IMG site was quite clear on Marino’s credentials: “Filippo Marino,senior consultant, has 10 years of international experience in the areas ofsecurity and environmental crime prevention. He is one of the founders ofSpecial Research Monitoring Centre (SRMC) and a founding member of the PermanentIntergovernmental Conference for Environmental Crime Prevention.” LexisNexisconfirmed Scaramella’s links established by Italian investigators to FilippoMarino.With great interest, I went back to IMG’s website. One of the consultants whosename was listed on the site was Curtis Perry. According to IMG, “Curtis Perry,senior consultant, has 27 years experience in government and private sectorsecurity and was stationed with the CIA throughout the Far East.” I skipped aparagraph. “Previously, he was employed as a Senior Consultant by a securityfirm of Ackerman & Palombo and was a managing director for Kroll Associates inManila 1992-1996.”Egad, Kroll! I made a note. I would need to check that link further. Another IMGconsultant was Robert Wager, whose biography claimed he managed security for theUS Embassy in Bogota, Colombia. Scaramella has also claimed to have worked inBogota, I thought to myself.The Internet biography of another consultant working for IMG, Ned Timmons,stated, “for two years Timmons directed an international import/exportcorporation related to environmental issues operating undercover in Colombia,Venezuela and Central America.” Another Colombia-IMG link describes John Stantonas a “senior consultant with 17 years experience in security management and 13years of specialization in Colombia. He has designed security in hostilelocations in Colombia, Panama, Ecuador and Chile.”So, IMG is comprised of a number of former US intelligence officers in Colombia,in addition to Mario Scaramella’s colleague, Filippo Marino. Along withAfghanistan, Colombia is one of the world’s epicenters for international drugtrade. In both of these locations, the CIA controls the routes and the profits,which are laundered through Wall Street. I knew that the Colombia-CIA-IMG linkwas no coincidence. I had no idea where I would end up, but experience taught methat the seemingly endless connections would eventually lead to an opening, if Icould stay the course.An SEC EDGAR search revealed a stockholders’ agreement between Harrison-KrollEnvironmental Services, Inc. of Louisiana and Palumbo Partners, dated December31, 1992, in which Kroll acquired Palumbo Partners.Kroll Associates is a renowned security company with extremely close ties to theCIA. Kroll, a very active player in private military contracting in Iraq, wasalso responsible for the security of the World Trade Center on 9/11. Accordingto my “community” sources, Jules Kroll, who founded Kroll Associates in 1972, inthe 1980s obtained much-needed cash from Foothill Capital when his firm fell onhard times. Foothill was deeply mixed up in the Savings & Loan collapses in the1980s, but somehow miraculously managed to survive by becoming a part of WellsFargo Bank.In addition, IMG chief Lou Palombo, while working with Kroll at his Miamivantage point, reportedly tracked the activities of Colombian drug cartels,including the Medellin Cartel, according to investigative journalist and formerNSA analyst, Wayne Madsen, in his highly respected online investigative journal,Wayne Madsen Report, on January 13, 2007. One final note on Palombo: he islinked to Avram Shalom, a former member of Israel’s Shin Beth domestic securityservice. My Mossad contacts told me that Shalom was fired after a scandalinvolving the massacre of Palestinian civilians. Subsequently, Shalom joinedKroll as a security consultant.Mario Scaramella’s link to Colombia intrigued me, including his association withIMG. Scaramella had claimed he was a professor of environmental law at ExternadoUniversity and the University of Nuestra Señora del Rosario in Bogotá. But, weknow that his Naples University credentials were a smokescreen and an emptypromise, and his Berlusconi links were also a figment of his imagination. Thereis no evidence that these Colombian affiliations were any less imaginary.I went back to the Scaramella archives in La Repubblica. According to numerousreports in the Italian press, the so-called “professor” ran an organizationcalled the Environmental Crime Prevention Program (ECPP) from his home base inNaples in the region of Campania.Naples holds an interesting connection to both Scaramella and Litvinenko. Notonly were traces of polonium 210 discovered in the office of Britain’s deputyambassador at the UK embassy in Moscow, but Britain’s Deputy Consul in Naples,Frederick Brian Keeves, signed a false passport for Alexander Litvinenko with afictitious identity: Edwin Redwald Carter. According to insider accounts, Keevesalso countersigned a document prepared by Litvinenko concerning a meeting with aRussian Mafia member who worked for the Russian Federal Security Bureau. He wasto have transported a “nuclear suitcase” from Moscow to Zurich for onwardshipment to the Middle East.The document, “authenticated” by the British authorities, ended up in theMitrokhin Commission archives in the Italian Parliament. The MitrokhinCommission is a controversial Italian parliamentary inquiry set up by right-wingpoliticians during Silvio Berlusconi’s prior time in power to investigate linksbetween Italian politicians and the KGB. Vasili Mitrokhin himself was the seniorarchivist for the First Chief Directorate of the KGB from 1972 to 1984. In 1992,after the collapse of the USSR, he had defected to the UK with his extensivefiles about agents and operations of the KGB and its predecessors, from theBolshevik revolution of 1917 onwards.In addition, the British consulate in Naples dovetailed neatly with MarioScaramella and the Italian consulate in Miami, Florida, which Scaramella used asa major base of operations. In fact, all of the forged documents passed byScaramella to the Mitrokhin Commission were authenticated and officially markedby the Italian Consulate in Miami.Scaramella’s ECPP website listed a number of officials whom he claimed to beaffiliated with his program. On November 15 and 16, 2000, the ECPP conductedwhat it called its “Fourth Intergovernmental Plenary” in New York City at theEnvironmental Protection Agency, where former Environmental Protection AgencyCriminal Enforcement legal council Michael J. Penders was named AssistantSecretary General of the ECPP. The Scaramella-Penders link is quite interesting.Penders is President of Environmental Security, Inc. (ESI), located in downtownWashington, just one block from the White House. The ESI website states that“ESI conducts investigations, implements environmental management and securitysystem … and training to improve environmental performance.” According to theBerlusconi-owned Italian magazine Panorama, Scaramella has boasted of hiscontacts with Penders.Scaramella’s conference biography stated that “Dr. Mario Scara- mella isSecretary General of ECPP, whose mission is to provide environmental protectionand security through technology on a global basis. ECPP has used aerialsurveillance and the remote sensing capabilities of satellites to detectenvironmental crimes and eco-terrorism.”Through a friend working for the US government, I got in touch with an officialin the Environmental Protection Agency. What’s going on? I asked him. Why areall these questionable characters with links to security companies also involvedwith environmental issues?The insider told me that the EPA criminal investigative branch has access toNASA’s sky-viewing geographical information system. “It means,” he continuedafter a brief silence, “they know where every ounce of bad [nuclear] stuff is inthe world, and they can get access to it. The EPA enforcement center’s dataimport/export database system has the capability to identify suspect shipmentsof nuclear material.”I went back to Scaramella’s biography, which described what ECPP does: “ECPP hasused aerial surveillance and the remote sensing capabilities of satellites todetect environmental crimes and eco-terrorism.” I scanned the list of officialsnamed as officers of the ECPP. One name jumped out at me: Toni Popovski, theEnvironmental Minister of Macedonia. In January 2000, Popovski was named as thedirector of the Regional Environmental Centre for Central and Eastern Europe(REC), which also happens to be the nexus for the smuggling of nuclear andradioactive material from the former USSR and Warsaw Pact nations. Other RECmembers included Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, the CzechRepublic, Macedonia, Malta, Serbia, Slovenia and Turkey, along with Germany,Canada, Austria and Switzerland. Many of these nations are part of the nuclearand narcotics smuggling trade.So what do we have so far? IMG “environmental” consultants with long-lastinglinks to Colombia and the CIA; Kroll Environmental Services and their CIA links;ECPP environmentalists and Mario Scaramella; Michael J. Penders and his ESIenvironmental management and security system. If the Environmental ProtectionAgency has been infiltrated by some of these people or their organizations, thenit raises some extremely troubling issues. The compromise of agencies in theUnited States and Europe that are tasked with monitoring the location andtransport of nuclear material represents an immense danger to public safetyaround the world, and the implications of Russian-Israeli, Chechen and/orCamorra Mafiosi penetrating environmental regulatory agencies are enormous. Ifcompromised, the regulators are in an ideal position to enable the shipment ofradioactive waste materials around the world.Might the “attack” Scaramella mentioned in the telephone transcript, forinstance, actually be referring to a dirty bomb? If the answer is affirmative,then the Litvinenko affair may be merely the tip of a “Titon iceberg” of hugeinternational nuclear smuggling operations and global false-flag terrorism: onewith hooks into the EPA and possibly the White House, but aimed at the UnitedStates and its allies.London’s Observer surmised as much in a December 3, 2006 report: “Among thetheories that remain open is that the poisonings were an accident that happened,while Litvinenko tried to assemble a dirty bomb for Chechen rebels. Those whoknow him believe he was crazy enough to attempt such a thing and, in the pastweek, some have implicated him in the smuggling of nuclear materials fromRussia.” This makes one wonder whether the November 24, 2006 press release onChechenpress.org [http://www.chechenpress.org], with its ominous reference to“the weapon,” may have been hinting at a Litvinenko project to build a purportedradioactive “dirty bomb.”According to nuclear physicist Alexander Borovoi, former consultant to theInternational Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, quoted in a December 14, 2006 UPIreport, “The worst part of the Litvinenko story is that it was like a rehearsalfor a dirty bomb. The incident shows that something dangerous is cooking in theterrorist kitchen, with menacing ideas and plans that can generally be describedas a crime…. Litvinenko or one of his close friends have somehow got hold ofpolonium. From them, we can trace a connection to those whose dream is to gethold of a dirty bomb – terrorists.”22I now thought back to La Repubblica’s revelations of that January 25, 2006conversation between Mario Scaramella and the mysterious ex-CIA agent namedPerry. In the conversation, Scaramella stressed to Perry that his activitieswere not “just my activities, but the activity of the organization.” It wasbecoming clear that the “organization” to which Scaramella was referring to wasa private and global intelligence organization involving former members of theKGB like Litvinenko, private military contractors, intelligence companies, aswell ex-CIA and ex-British intelligence officers.The more confusing the Litvinenko affair became, the more it appeared to be yetanother example of a nefarious worldwide network of spies, weapons smugglers,far-right politicians, Russian-Israeli Mafia businessmen, and Islamic mujaheedinfalse-flag provocateurs. If anything, Litvinenko’s death helped to expose thisinternational network.Far from being a sympathetic figure, as the corporate media would have usbelieve, Litvinenko was a player in a global crime, disinformation, andterrorist networks, with links to all the shady characters who played such a keyrole in Russia’s disintegration, through ill conceived “loans-for-shares” theftof billions of dollars of the International Monetary Fund’s money, and also viagangster capitalism. Litvinenko also had contacts with the United KingdomIndependence Party, a right-wing British political party; the mujaheedinmovements of Chechnya and Dagestan; and the Russian-Israeli criminalorganization of wanted Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky and his accomplices.Many Litvinenko contacts, including former KGB colleagues whose loyalty toBerezovsky has been proved beyond any reasonable doubt, have strong ties to thecriminal world. And we have noted his connection to two British mercenary firmsoperating in Iraq: Titon and Erinys.With geopolitical fault lines erupting everywhere and the latest energy crisisthen making itself known in earnest, it was no surprise to find ZbigniewBrzezinski and his ilk returning to familiar stomping grounds – the original“geostrategic” battle plan for control of the “Grand Chessboard,” with Russia asthe key. Of course Russia, like the United States and Britain, is deeplyenmeshed in the world of Deep Politics, which are, in the words of academicPeter Dale Scott, “Political practices and arrangements, deliberate or not,which are usually repressed rather than acknowledged.”23Notes1.

There is little doubt that Litvinenko did not write the “deathbed” letter.The letter exists in only one form: a typed, stylistically perfect English text.The problem with the letter’s credibility is that Litvinenko hardly spokeEnglish at all. If the letter was dictated to Alex Goldfarb, who thentranscribed it for the world, there has to exist a Russian original, be it inwritten form or in a taped conversation.

In the post-Cold Warworld, Russia’s role has been fundamental, for whosoever gains Russia’sresources holds the key to global supremacy. Thus, destabilizing the Russianstate became the goal of the Shadow Masters after the collapse of the SovietUnion in December 1991.The United States undertook a massive effort to help the former Soviet Unionmake a transition to capitalism. As it turned out, the effort was intended toremove large amounts of wealth from the country. According to an internal FBImemo by Treasury Special Agent Philip Wainwright, but signed only as “Mr. X,”the Russia objective was quite simple: “There would be a possibility of aWestern privately orchestrated economic Jihad that could help crush theCommunist ruling powers by destroying their unstable rouble.”In other words, the Soviet Union – possessing the world’s largest mineralwealth, a vast reservoir of gold and gemstones, the world’s largest oilreserves, untold quantities of nickel, platinum, and palladium, and more timberthan the Amazon, not to mention an immense stockpile of Soviet-era weapons – wasto be asset-stripped. The strategy was intended to topple the country intoanarchy, to the point Russia could not oppose US military operations designed tosecure control of the oil and gas reserves in Central Asia. The plan developed,as echoed by former National Security Adviser under President Carter, ZbigniewBrzezinski, in his 1997 book, The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and ItsGeostrategic Imperatives, became a part of the most spectacular criminal coupever devised.In the period leading up to its collapse, floods of movable wealth left theUSSR. Truckloads of Soviet roubles motored down autobahns. Many were used incomplex swap operations in which billions of narco-dollars were laundered onbehalf of the Calabrian Mafia, Ndrangheta. Numerous prime western banks such asthe US Treasury using the Harvard Endowment, Bank of New York, Goldman Sachs,Massachusetts banking giants Fleet Financial and Bank of Boston looted up to$500 billion. Also participating was the CIA, whose chief goal was to destroythe Soviet currency. Ndrangheta, one of the most feared criminal organizationsin the world, is financially interlocked in its drug-running business withColombian and Mexican criminal cartels. Since the dismemberment of the SovietUnion, the Russian Mafia has joined Calabrian operations, providing an easternroot to the already lucrative cocaine and heroin business.In one operation, 280 billion roubles1 – with a market value ofhundreds ofbillion of dollars at the official commercial rate of exchange – were beingauctioned to leading figures in the world of organized crime. In January 1991,shady Russian dealers were offering “140 billion clean, clear, good, legal,bundled, counted, verified, packed and stamped Russian roubles” for an estimated$7.7 billion from a dubious Liechtenstein-based company, but the transaction wasfoiled by a KGB sting operation. Six months later, another transaction with amarket value of 140 billion roubles netted $4.5 billion, demonstrating howquickly the currency had been devaluing.The entire Russian government apparatus was gripped with panic as cash wasdraining out of Moscow at an astronomical rate.At the time, no one could understand why Colombian cartels, the Mafia and theworld’s criminal fraternities were lining up to purchase with hard cash (albeitat a fraction of the official rate, sometimes for as low as eight cents on thedollar) vast quantities of what was in effect little more than colored paper.These were hard-nosed criminals with keen business minds honed by “decades ofgreed and power, and were not known for squandering their wealth.”In a murky cloak-and-dagger operation, western intelligence services worked withblack market profiteers, leading banking houses, the Italian Cosa Nostra, theAmerican Mafia and the Russian Thieves’ World, former KGB officers, veterans ofthe Afghan war, and unemployed military officers to expedite illegal allianceson a colossal scale meant to destabilize, and eventually to destroy, the USSR.On the one hand, you had criminals preparing to launder their dirty narcoticsrevenue, while on the other, opportunists expected to garner a giant profit whenthe rouble became repatriated. They bought bargain-basement priced commoditieswith devalued currency as “inward investments” and financed crooked jointventure companies mushrooming in the meantime. In 1990 and 1991, the roubleproved to be the currency of choice.Fearful of plunder, Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov announced in a February 12,1991 interview in a Russian daily newspaper, Trud, that the government haduncovered a “plot by Western banks in Switzerland, Canada and Austria to floodthe country with billions of rouble bank notes.” Such a move would createinstant hyperinflation and, in turn, destabilize the Soviet Union financially.Pavlov saw this plot as a quiet and bloodless annexation of the Soviet Union’seconomy in order to eventually topple the government.According to British investigator David Guyatt, “It became clear that themassive quantities of exported roubles weren’t just coloured paper. Almostworthless on the international market, they were repatriated through some of the260 Mafia-controlled banks that sprang-up around the country…. Wasting no time,the now roublerich Mafia set about plundering Russia’s abundant naturaltreasures: platinum, gemstones, oil, lumber, strategic raw materials,non-ferrous metals such as cobalt, copper, bronze, titanium, and evencaterpillar tractors and other high value equipment; all went under the hiddenhammer.”2Robert Friedman, in the January 1996 cover story, “Money Plane,” for the NewYorker magazine explained how the process worked: “Russian assets, such as oil,are stolen by underworld figures or corrupt plant managers and sold on the spotmarket in Rotterdam. The proceeds are wired through front companies on theContinent and deposited in London banks. Gangsters place an order for, say, $40million in US currency through a bank in Moscow. The bank wires their bank ofchoice, placing a purchase order for the cash. The bank of choice buys thecurrency from the New York Federal Reserve. Simultaneously, bank of choicereceives a wire transfer for the same account from the London bank. Bank ofchoice pockets a commission and flies the cash from New York to Moscow. It isthen used by mobsters to buy narcotics or villas, or run political campaigns.”3A Wall Street brokerage or investment bank may also go “offshore” in order tolegally borrow once-laundered drug money to finance a corporate merger orleveraged buyout (LBO). Why do this? If you were a major investment banker orsecurities firm and could arrange to borrow laundered drug money at say fivepercent rather than the ten your bank wants, and you are in a cutthroatcompetition to buy a company, would you be willing to lower your cost of capitalin this way? It is hardly surprising that such practices are becoming “businessas usual.”In December 1989, the First Directorate (PGU – Pervoe Glavnoe Up-ravlenie, FirstChief Directorate – Foreign), and the Sixth Department (which dealt withinternational economic programs) realized that the chaos about to overwhelm theSoviet Union in the wake of its political crises would leave the country withoutan economic structure to perform the tasks needed by the Russian state. Theyconcluded that the survival of the entire nation was at stake.The Communist Party leadership gave the KGB responsibility to embark on aperestroika campaign of mass pilferage of state property and natural resources,and commissioned it to dump roubles abroad, illegally sell vast quantities ofraw materials for hard currency, and launder the hard currency proceeds in theWest.4 Weeks after the Soviet collapse, a parliamentary investigative commissionreported the following:… realizing as irrevocable the loss of then-authoritative and ideologicalpriorities in society, the Politburo of the CPSU CC [Central Committee] madeseveral secret resolutions toward direct concealment in commercial structures ofproperty and monetary resources actually accumulated at the expense of thenation. Based on this, at all levels of the party hierarchy, there was a massfounding of party banks, joint enterprises, and joint stock companies in 1990and 1991.5A Central Committee resolution titled “On Emergency Measures to OrganizeCommercial and Foreign Economic Activity of the Party,” passed in 1990, detailshow the Party intended from the start to conceal its holdings in the embryonicmarket economy. The resolution called for numerous actions, including:• preparation of proposals to create some new “interim” economic structures(foundations, associations, etc.), with minimum “visible” ties to the CentralCommittee, which could become focal points of the “invisible” Party economy;• immediate preparation of plans for using anonymous organizations to maskdirect links to the Party when launching commercial and foreign economic Partyactivity; in particular, consideration of the possibility of merging withalready functioning joint ventures, international consortiums, etc., throughcapital investment.• consideration of ways and means of establishing a bank controlled by theCentral Committee with the right to conduct hard- currency operations, theinvestment of the Party’s hard-currency reserves in international firmscontrolled by friends of the Party;• creation of a consulting firm with the status of a legal entity, but withoutdirect links to the Central Committee apparatus, for the practical organizationof economic cooperation and the provision of brokerage services for foreigneconomic activity of various Party organizations and the commercial firms offraternal parties.6In their 1991-1992 probe, parliamentary investigators found that the ExternalIntelligence Service (Sluzhba Vneshnei Razvedki, SVR) was a key player inlarge-scale money laundering between 1989 and 1991 (when it was known as the KGBFirst Chief Directorate) and that the SVR had covered up the entire operationsince that time. According to investigator A.P. Surkov, describing a highlysophisticated arrangement of phony agreements, ghost companies and offshoreaccounts throughout Europe in 1992:… the Party moved abroad at least 60 tonnes of gold, eight tonnes of platinum,150 tonnes of silver, and in the safes of Western banks are stored resources ofthe Communist Party amounting to from 15 to 50 billion dollars. There aresignificant violations with valuable metals, which have shown up in the StateRepository for Precious Metals. Gold bullion, for example, was provided to theKGB. On October 30 of [1990], the KGB was given 502 kilograms of valuables.Among this were gold bullion, gold American dollars [coins] stored for somespecial operations, and they were not returned in time, a gold brooch with 31diamonds, a gold ring with 20 diamonds, a gold brooch with 12 diamonds and twoemeralds, a gold necklace with 104 diamonds, a gold brooch with 60 diamonds, andso on . and there is a basis to think that the Moscow Special Alloys Plant didnot fall outside the KGB’s attention, and naturally, that of Partyfunctionaries.The new money would be stored in one of the newly created banks, 80% of which,according to the US State Department and BBC News report of November 21, 1998,7were under the control of organized crime. In the pre-Perestroika Soviet Union,the banking system basically consisted of a single bank, Gosbank, rudimentarilyrun and owned by the government which the Russian people instinctively did nottrust. This “instinct” had more to do with a fatalistic nature of a Russian soulthan any concrete evidence to the contrary. Because wages were paid only incash, and households used cash exclusively for making payments, Russiansrightfully had a penchant for stuffing money in mattresses and socks, somethingthe KGB planners realized was not feasible.One of these “new banks” established by the Party and the KGB apparatus was BankMenatep, set up to handle the fund transfers. Men in their late 20s and early30s were given authority, and the money flowed. The system hadn’t changed, northe beneficiaries.Former KGB Colonel Viktor Kichikhin, who served in the First Chief Directorateresponsible for ideological enforcement, witnessed the process firsthand: “In1989-1990, most of the Soviet- Western joint venture enterprises were created byour directorate, except those which were established directly by the CentralCommittee of the CPSU.”8The process was so integrated that former KGB general Timofeyev commented, “Themarket will be occupied by the ruling apparatus and the KGB, because they havethe opportunities to control the process of privatization and the creation ofnew enterprises. They have the licenses, they have the influence. This is not somuch for the party’s sake as it is for self preservation,” and added, “There isundoubtedly an element here of an organized retreat … under which the retreatingforce tries to maintain some element or order and the possibility of preservinga nucleus, and then perhaps, in time, returning to the past.”9There may be as many as six thousand of these “retreating” KGB Chekists inpowerful positions.10 “Chekists,” by the way, were the Soviet Secret Policeunder Felix Dzerzinski in the 1920s; since then the term has been usedpejoratively to refer to any secret service apparatchiks. The list of KGB/Putinappointments reads like a who’s who of KGB elite: Vladimir Putin, Prime Ministerof Russia, former Colonel of the KGB; Nikolai Patrushev, current secretary ofthe Security Council of Russia; Igor Sechin, head of second biggest oilproducer, Rosneft; Valery Golubyev, a former KGB general appointed to the topposition at state-run energy giant, Gasprom; Yuriy Zaostrovtsev, FSB deputydirector; Viktor Ivanov, Director of Russia’s Federal Service for Control ofNarcotics; Boris Gryzlov Minister of the Interior; Sergei Ivanov, DefenseMinister; Prosecutor General, Vladimir Ustinov; Sergei Stepashin, chief of theAudit Chamber; Sergei Pugachov, president of Mezhprombank Bank; Nikolai Negodov,deputy transportation minister; Vladimir Yakunin, first deputy president of theRussian Railways Co.; Konstantin Romodanovsky, chief of internal security at theMinistry of the Interior; Viktor Cherkesov, head of the Tax Police; , and acurrent chairman of the national airline Aeroflot.The Russian mob, known as the Vorovskoi Mir, or “Thieves’ World,” a loosefederation of Soviet mobsters, immediately grasped that the “retreat” ofCommunism heralded a glorious new world criminal order for them.Within one year of Mikhail Gorbachev’s ousting, over 2,600 “crime clans,”employing more than three million criminals, had appeared and spread likewildfire throughout the former Soviet empire, according to a research paperwritten by a group of Fellows for the prestigious Hoover Institute.11 Forty ofthem equal or surpass the size of both the Sicilian and American Mafias. Takentogether, they comprise the most powerful criminal enterprise on earth.In fact, the CPSU’s secret directive emphasized the need to forge a link withthe mafiya through the vast resources of the former KGB. That was in thebeginning of the 1990s. The early stages of the Yeltsin reign.By 1997, the Soviet Union had been dead for six years. A new world had emergedin which the United States alone ranked as a superpower. Yet Russia stillremained a threat – a potential block to the complete imposition of US economicand military will. In Zbigniew Brzezinski’s The Grand Chessboard, published in1997, “Russia” and “vital energy reserves,” as it turns out, are mentioned morefrequently than any other country or subject in the book.Once again, energy imperatives and geopolitical control would come to play a keyrole in the lives of hundreds of millions of people.It was in Russia’s backyard, the central Asian republics of the old SovietUnion, where Brzezinski saw that the move would have to be made to corner theworld’s energy reserves. The history of mankind has always shown thatcontrolling the heart of Eurasia was the key to controlling the entire globe.Azerbaijan, which contains the riches of the Caspian Sea Basin and Central Asia,is key. The independence of the Central Asian states can be rendered nearlymeaningless if Azerbaijan becomes fully subordinated to Moscow’s control.Though motives have changed over 20 centuries, this area’s strategic importanceremains essentially the same. Brzezinski spelled out the compelling issuedriving American policy: “A power that dominates Eurasia would control two ofthe world’s three most advanced and economically productive regions. A mereglance at the map also suggests that control over Eurasia would almostautomatically entail Africa’s subordination, rendering the Western Hemisphereand Oceania geopolitically peripheral to the world’s central continent. About 75percent of the world’s people live in Eurasia, and most of the world’s physicalwealth is there as well, both in its enterprise and underneath its soil. Eurasiaaccounts for 60 percent of the world’s GNP and about three-fourth of the world’sknown energy resources.”12Again the energy theme appears later in Brzezinski’s book: “The world’s energyconsumption is bound to vastly increase over the next two or three decades.Estimates by the US Department of Energy anticipate that world demand will riseby more than 50 percent between 1993 and 2015, with the most significantincrease in consumption occurring in the Far East. The momentum of Asia’seconomic development is already generating massive pressures for the explorationand exploitation of new sources of energy.”13With the Middle East safely but implicitly included, but minimized in hisdiscussion, Brzezinski stressed the importance of central Eurasia, particularlyfor the critical goal of diversification of energy supplies: “Moreover, they[the Central Asian Republics] are of importance from the standpoint of securityand historical ambitions to at least three of their most immediate and morepowerful neighbours, namely Russia, Turkey, and Iran, with China also signallingan increasing political interest in the region. But the Eurasian Balkans areinfinitely more important as a potential economic prize: an enormousconcentration of natural gas and oil reserves is located in the region, inaddition to important minerals, including gold.”14Could the eventual dismemberment and weakening of Russia to the point it couldnot oppose US military operations that have now successfully secured control ofthe oil and gas reserves in Central Asia been part of a multi-decade plan forglobal domination? One of the terms I have come to hear when referring to Russiais “Weimar Russia.” This is a reference to Germany after WWI, when reparationsand plundering by the Allies destroyed Germany’s economic base, createdhyperinflation and ripped the social fabric apart. Some experts have describedthe economic jihad against Russia as a deliberate attempt to revert thetottering superpower to Third World status.First came the chicken, then the egg, then the ubiquitous Russian cucumber, thenthe Bolshoi, and finally oil. With oil, came market reforms orchestrated by someof the best and brightest of world financiers such as Jeffrey D. Sachs andAnders Aslund. Market reforms in an unconsolidated and sluggishly developingproto-democracy, such as Russia, inevitably created the collapse of the Russianeconomy. Its population was rendered desperate, and its ability to support aworld-class military establishment destroyed, which inevitably invitedcolonialism. This colonization, masked as reforms, destroyed the basicinstitutions of Russian society along the following basic lines:1. Destruction of the financial system of the state, by means of an endlessbuild up of the state-debt pyramid, shrinking of the tax base, deepening of thenon-payments crisis, and disorganization of the monetary system.2. Destruction of the scientific and technological potential of the country,achieved by means of a many-folded reduction in state financing of science, thecollapse of technological cooperation and scientific production integration, inthe course of mass privatization, and the refusal of the government to have anyscientific and technical, industrial, or structural policy at all.3. Sale of controlling blocs of shares in the leading and most valuable Russianfirms, in industry, electric power, and telecommunications, to foreigncompanies.4. Transfer of the right to exploit the most valuable Russian raw materialsdeposits to transnational corporations.5. Establishment of foreign control over the Russian stock exchange.6. Establishment of direct foreign control over the shaping of Russian domesticand foreign economic policy.15Among the policies of the Yeltsin government, none did as much to discredit thenotion of reform as the thoroughly corrupt “loans-for-shares” program. It wasdevised by a former Soviet trade official turned banker, Vladimir Potanin, andfurther developed by a consortium of the new Russian banks. “Loans-for-shares”was run by Anatoly Chubais, key ally of the Clinton administration, who isprimarily known for his role under Yegor Gaidar as the vice-premier of theRussian Government under Yeltsin. Gaidar and Chubais, in the mid 1990s, werecredited with “shock therapy” privatization and the creation of the Russianoligarchs that overnight left 40% of Russians penniless and starving. The term“shock therapy” refers to the sudden release of price and currency controls,combined with the withdrawal of state subsidies, and immediate tradeliberalization within a country, all the necessary ingredients forimpoverishment of the Russian societyIn failing to oppose “loans-for-shares” and continuing to endorse Chubaisstrongly after its shock therapy, scandal-ridden failure, the Clintonadministration tacitly endorsed means that fundamentally undermined America’spublicly stated objective: to help the former Soviet Union, and in particularRussia, make a “successful transition” to capitalism. As it turned out, the USefforts were intended to remove large amounts of wealth from the region anddebilitate Russia. What happened was that Russia, in the words of Yeltsinhimself, became a “superpower of crime,” a “mafiocracy,” not merely because ofthe absence of adequate laws (or the supposed robber-baron period which someapologists say is a natural stage of economic development), but because of theinherently corrupt nature of its law enforcement, security organs, andintelligence services.16Though the seeds had been planted by the outgoing George H.W. Bushadministration, the US assistance program to facilitate Russia’s transition tocapitalism took off under the new Clinton administration in 1993. A task forceheaded by Vice President Al Gore, Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and DeputySecretary of State Talbot involved an exclusive US Treasury contract withGoldman Sachs, the Harvard Institute for International Development, theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and the World Bank. Their partnership withthe government of Boris Yeltsin remade the Russian economy.One of the clues to this remake was given in Zbigniew Brzezinski’s 1997 book,The Grand Chessboard. As far as Russia was concerned, the imperative was clear:“Understandably, the immediate task has to be to reduce the probability ofpolitical anarchy or a reversion to a hostile dictatorship in a crumbling statestill possessing a nuclear arsenal. But the long-range task remains: how toencourage Russia’s democratic transformation and economic recovery whileavoiding the re-emergence of a Eurasian empire that could obstruct the AmericanGeostrategic goal . But, in the meantime, it is imperative that no Eurasianchallenger [Russia] emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus of alsochallenging America.17Both economic and strategic considerations drive US interests in the oil and gasreserves of Central Asia. After the decline of the Ottoman Empire in the 19thcentury, Russia faced another colonial power on one of its southern flanks,separated from British India by wild Afghanistan. Their struggle over Asia’shigh ground became known as the “Great Game,” and they played it for a century,not only to gain control of important resources for themselves, but also to denythem to others. Today, US world domination is based largely upon its nearhegemony in the world oil economy. Official US policy in Central Asia, as an NSCofficial told Congress in 1997, was to “break Russia’s monopoly control over thetransportation of oil and gas from that region, and frankly, to promote Westernenergy security through diversification of supply.”18One of the first steps towards breaking that monopoly took place in mid-December1999, when US officials participated in a formal meeting in Azerbaijan in whichspecific programs for the training and equipping of mujaheedin, Muslim guerrillafighting forces, from the Caucasus, Central and South Asia and the Arab worldwere discussed and agreed upon. “This meeting led to Washington’s tacitencouragement of both Muslim allies and US private security companies to assistthe Chechens and their Islamic allies to sustain the ensuing jihad [againstRussia].”19The Taliban’s rise to power in Afghanistan can be linked to the same, single,golden theme of denying oil to your competitor – in this case, Russia – bypushing Russia out of its natural sphere of influence. Armed conflicts on thesouthern frontiers of Russia’s territory in Nagorno-Karabakh, Abkhazia andChechnya “represented a distinct, tactical move, crucial at the time, indiscerning which power would ultimately become master [of the energy supply].”20THE CROWNING OF BORIS YELTSINAcceptance of Boris Yeltsin by the Western press was a key ingredient in theequation. Once the mainstream press followed the lead of the Clintonadministration and defined the former hard-line Communist apparatchik andalcoholic Boris Yeltsin as a ‘democrat,’ the looting of Russia began. Communistapparatchik and alcoholic Boris Yeltsin as a ‘democrat,’ the looting of Russiabegan.Journalist Anne Williamson was for many years a leading expert on Russian andSoviet affairs, writing for among others, the Wall Street Journal and the NewYork Times. She lived in Russia, spoke the language, and saw firsthand what wasdone to Russia in the 1990s. Her testimony to the US Congress on how the RussianFederation was dismembered and pillaged forms part of the historical record.21What Williamson described before the Committee on Banking and Financial Servicesof the US House of Representatives on September 21, 1999, is the creation andinstallation of a whole new set of elites, the oligarchs, whose motives –personal enrichment at any cost – were already known. The oligarchs were lovedin the West because they were rather unsophisticated and also could be readilycontrolled with money. In her testimony before Committee on Banking and Finance,Anne Williamson said, “Western assistance, IMF lending and the targeted divisionof national assets are what provided Boris Yeltsin the initial wherewithal topurchase his constituency of ex-Komsomol [Communist Youth League] bank chiefs,who were given the freedom and the mechanisms to plunder their own country intandem with a resurgent and more economically competent criminal class.”22The new elite learned everything about the confiscation of wealth and thestripping down of assets, but nothing about its creation. In a sense, modernRussian political life cannot be understood without reference to the veryRussian phenomenon of ”political technology,”23 which in Russian understandingof realpolitik involves both manipulation of individuals and large-scaledeception. As Peter Reddaway explains, “Part of this process, was the growingnon-accountability of the Yeltsin regime and the taking of most realdecision-making out of public sphere and into the privacy of the bath houses andtennis courts used by Yeltsin, his confidant Alexander Korzhakov, and theircronies. This increasingly secretive method of government involved themanipulation of parties, social groups and public opinion, both through themedia and through a wide range of deceptions and dirty tricks during electioncampaigns.”24Indeed, with the presidential election of 2000 fast approaching, an “advisorygroup,” made up of committee chairmen of the US House of Representatives, issueda report on the mess Clinton and company had made in Russia. Of course, with themajority Republicans holding all the chairmanships, the report must be read inthe context of US politics. Nonetheless, and perhaps because their party wasuninvolved in the affair, I find their report to be candid and largely ontarget. Certainly the title of their September 2000 report leaves little roomfor misinterpretation: “Russia’s Road To Corruption: How the Clintonadministration Exported Government Instead of Free Enterprise and Failed theRussian People.” Here is a bit of what they had to say:In 1995, Russia was under considerable pressure from the IMF and the Clintonadministration to implement the IMF-Clinton troika program of increasing taxrevenues to meet arbitrary budget deficit targets…. Russians’ real income haddropped to the lowest levels since Soviet days. The Russian government [underYeltsin] desperately needed cash, but a new IMF loan at the moment seemedimpossible since Russian government borrowing in 1995 had already soared to over350% of the prior year’s.To meet the IMF and Clinton administration demands for more government revenues,Potanin, Chubais, and their colleagues devised a secretive plan in the springand summer of 1995 for the Russian government to borrow money from Russianbanks. As collateral, the government would offer stock in premier state-ownedindustries.25In exchange for the stock, the government issued bonds. Bonds represent debt. Aswith any debt, if it can’t be paid, then the collateral used to secure it isforfeited. The report continued:The key feature of the “loans-for-shares” scheme was the proviso that if thegovernment were unable to repay the loans, the banks would have the right toauction the shares – primarily in the energy, natural resources, metals, andmanufacturing industries. Given the banks’ ability to rig such auctions, and thefact that the loans were heavily over-collateralized, default by the Russiangovernment would yield a bonanza for the banks’ owners.A number of observers [including such qualified observers as Chrystia Freeland,a former Rhodes Scholar and Deputy Editor of the Financial Times, JosephStiglitz former chief economist of the World Bank and Anne Williamson] believethe “loans-for-shares” scheme was actually designed with the intention ofturning over these enterprises to the select insider group who were allowed toparticipate, and that from the inception the government neither intended nor wasable to repay the loans.26 The government needed money, and this was a way ofgetting at least a small amount of it while simultaneously accomplishing twoother objectives: “privatizing” industries without Duma [Russia’s legislature]approval, and providing political friends with enormous new wealth through anon-competitive process. Some Russian officials apparently believed that thebeneficiaries of “loans-for-shares” could then be counted upon as a powerfulpolitical constituency in favor of market reforms.In its execution, the “loans-for-shares” scheme failed to produce a constituencyfor reform – the bankers’ real interest was in increasingly lucrative sweetheartdeals – but did succeed in winning the support of a powerful group ofbusinessmen for the Yeltsin government in the upcoming elections. It is notdifficult to see why: exceptionally valuable government assets were virtuallygiven away at a fraction of their true worth. As one of the oligarchs commentedwith significant understatement, “each ruble invested in one’s own politicianyields a 100% profit.”27When the shares pledged as collateral were eventually sold after the governmentfailed to repay the loans they secured, the winning bid was almost invariablysubmitted by an affiliate of the bank managing the auction – and typicallyexceeded the minimum bid by only a nominal amount. Thus the “loans-for-shares”program essentially offered a select group of Russian bankers an opportunity toacquire cut-rate shares in prized state enterprises.Since then, a number of the oligarchs have been brought before the courts fortheir misdeeds. Russian state prosecutors initiated corruption investigations in1999 against both Boris Berezovsky, at one time Russia’s leading oligarch, andVladimir Gusinsky, an oligarch and one time Berezovsky associate. Both have fledrather than stand trial. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the target of a similar probe,was arrested on October 25, 2003. He is currently in prison camp number 13 in –where else? – Siberia. Security operations in Yukos and other Khodorkovskycompanies had been run by Mikhail Yosifovich Shestopalov. Shestopalov,ironically, is a former head of the Division for Combating Thefts of SocialistProperty and Speculation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and an intimatefriend of Yuri Primakov, former director of the KGB. In the end, the system,controlled by the ruling apparatus and by the KGB, hadn’t changed, nor had thebeneficiaries. There were secret service agents loyal to the Party at everylevel of Bank Menatep. In the fall of 1995, Khodorkovsky’s Bank Menatep wasgiven the right to conduct an auction for a 45% stake in the state-owned oilgiant, Yukos.28 It was clear to informed observers that a monumental rip-off wasbrewing, but it turned out to be startling, even by the standards of 1990sRussia, in both its simplicity and audacity.As the representative of the seller, Khodorkovsky had sold Yukos to himself! TheSoviet Union’s third-largest stockpile of oil came along with the title and deedto the company, and Yukos was generally regarded as one of the crown jewels ofthe Russian economy. According to the murdered, former-Forbes senior writer PaulKhlebnikov, Khodorkovsky and his partners, Leonid Nevzlin, Mikhail Brudno,Vladimir Dubov and Platon Lebedev, “ended up with a 78% stake in Yukos – forwhich they paid $309 million. How absurd was this sum? In the summer of ’97, twomonths after this deal was finalized, Yukos was trading on the Russian stockexchange at a market capitalization of $6 billion.”29CLINTON AND THE IMF RESCUE OF YELTSINDesperately afraid that Yeltsin, with a 3% approval rating perhaps the mostunpopular politician in history, would not be reelected in 1996, the Clintonadministration pushed through a new $10.2 billion International Monetary Fundloan in March of that year, which provided liquidity not only for the Russiancentral government also but for Yeltsin’s campaign.The 2000 report from the US House group condemned this loan in no uncertainterms:By December 31, 1995, the Russian central government had borrowed over $10billion through the IMF. When on March 26, 1996, the IMF and Russian centralgovernment reached final agreement on a new loan of $10.2 billion – thesecond-largest loan ever made30 to any borrower by the IMF – many outsideobservers were dumbfounded.In a single commitment, the IMF was preparing to flood the Kremlin with moremoney than it had disbursed in the more than four years since the end of theSoviet Union. The extension of such significant new credit was surprisingbecause there was little in the way of basic free-market reform legislation inplace to justify it. There was still no market in banking services, no reliableprotection for private property rights, no mortgage lending, and no honestsystem of commercial dispute resolution.On its merits, there was little economic justification for extending the IMFpackage in March 1996. The loans-for-shares ersatz “privatization” of majorRussian industries into the hands of a few insiders was already notorious. Thepoor state of the Russian Federation’s official budget and finances made itimplausible to assume that the government would ever repay the latest IMF loan.Worst of all, the loan did not effectively stipulate economic conditionality: inthe first year alone, the IMF granted three waivers for “nonobservance ofperformance criteria.”31In fact, President Clinton had endorsed the loan a month before the details ofthe commitment were even agreed upon. The president could do this because theUnited States was the largest contributor – about 18.25% or $35 billion – of theIMF’s total quotas. With such heavy US influence on the IMF, Clinton’sendorsement left little doubt that the loans would be made, and the Clintonadministration turned the IMF into an agent of US policy in Russia.In reality, the Clinton administration’s decision to extend yet another IMF loanwas nothing short of a sophisticated form of bribery. “When Clinton was pushingthe NATO Expansion Treaty through the Senate, which Russia looked upon asprovocative, the US President defused Yeltsin’s opposition by assuring hisre-election with a $10 billion IMF loan front-loaded with a billion dollars incash.”32Immediately following the accord with the IMF, explained Simon Pirani and EllisFarrell at a symposium in Moscow in 1999, “the Russian Central Bank began toplace funds, including much of the money Russia had been loaned by the IMF, intothe accounts of its offshore subsidiaries Fimaco and Evrobank.”33 This money wasthen recycled back in to the Russian financial markets to buy short-termtreasury bonds [GKOs]. This pump-priming with funds from Fimaco and Evrobankinflated the GKO market, and western investors and financial institutions thencaught the GKO mania, without understanding what was really going on, therebyboth betting for and helping assure a Yeltsin victory at the polls.The Central Bank fixed the rouble exchange rate, interest rates rose and theyields on the GKOs increased to insane levels – nearly 200% by the time of theelection. “The result was that the state was able to use the proceeds from thesale of the GKOs to pay off pensions and wages in arrears shortly before theelection; it also let private employers know that they should pay off wagesarrears rather than pay their taxes. This, together with completely fictitiouspromises that (for example) army conscription would be abolished, enabledYeltsin to be re-elected.”34The alleged threat of a Communist election victory had been ludicrouslyoverblown. The Communist Party was way out of its league. The combination ofoligarch millions and western marketing panache had dazzled the primitiveRussians into voting for the corrupt and criminal Yeltsin regime. The votes hadbeen in effect purchased with IMF money that had been converted to roubles andthen recycled through the GKO market to boost its value. A gigantic bubble wasforming.The 290-percent yields (on three-month paper at one point) on Russian GKOs werepaid with US taxpayers’ money via IMF loans. It isn’t difficult to surmise theinvestments’ final destination. “By yielding those kind of non-market returns,”reported Anne Williamson, “the bond market insured that all the country’sresources and all that it was capable of attracting went to the support of thestate, just as Czarism and Communism had done previously.”35Compounding the pillage, a number of investment schemes sponsored by theExport-Import Bank of the United States, the Overseas Private InvestmentCorporation, and a number of congressionally mandated funds were designed forindividuals, Russian corporations, and banks. These initiatives created nothingother than huge money laundries. The Russian bond market’s unscrupulouslyleveraged returns, sustained by IMF loans, were a magnet for investors, and soondeveloped into a classic pyramid scheme. As fast as the IMF, the World Bank, andinstitutions lent money to Russia, providing astronomical returns to favoredplayers, just so quickly was the money taken right back out of Russia. Thosehuge sums, initially provided by taxpayers, returned to Wall Street, US banks,and Harvard, according to Anne Williamson’s US House of Representativestestimony. 36As debt analyst David Riley put it in London’s Observer on October 17, 1999:“All this was part of the build up to the Russian financial crash in August1998.” Russia was literally a free lunch for American institutions andnon-profit organizations. Eventually, of course, the Russian economy collapsedso badly that it was necessary to secure a total bailout from the IMF: theultimate kiss of death for any country, and all funded by American taxpayers.To get the Russian nation out of its quagmire, the country desperately needed“direct investment, not speculative debt traders.”37 Why then did internationallending and bilateral aid programs work overwhelmingly to the international debtmerchants’ benefit? All aid programs form part of the IMF’s liberalizationpolicy. They are meant first to advance globally the Federal Reserve’s moneymonopoly through IMF lending and the private banking sector, and secondly, tosubsidize expansion of US firms into foreign markets thus improving conditionsfor speculative finance capital to operate.38In the aftermath of the August 1998 meltdown, an editorial in the FinancialTimes suggested that the IMF should stop lending to support currencies (i.e.,the rouble) at unsustainable levels. To its credit, the Financial Times onDecember 31, 1998 published a scathing rebuttal in a letter from economist HarryShutt. Such a suggestion, he argued, “indicates a failure to grasp that suchsupport [from the IMF] is driven by a desire to give priority help to foreignshort-term speculators investing in emerging markets at the expense of the realeconomy” [emphasis added].“Combined with the absence of exchange controls (also insisted on by the Fund),”Shutt continued, “it [IMF support for currencies at unsustainable levels]ensures that domestic interest rates are kept at astronomic levels in order todefend the overvalued parity. This in turn ensures that, as long as the exchangerate is kept more or less stable [through IMF-funded intervention in themarket], holders of government treasury bills at interest rates ranging from 40%to 100% make super profits, while local enterprise is strangled, government debtis pushed to ever more unfundable levels, public servants and pensioners gounpaid and millions more are subjected to destitution and premature death”[emphasis added].39THE FINAL DAYSThe US House report succinctly tells the story:The disaster that began on August 17, 1998, spread immediately throughoutRussia. Millions of ordinary men and women who had deposited their money inRussian banks lost everything. ATM and debit cards ceased to work. Dozens ofbanks became insolvent and disappeared. Angry depositors besieged Russian banks,only to learn they had been wiped out.Millions of senior citizens, whose meager pension income had been suspended formonths, were cut off completely. When the dust finally settled in March 1999,the ruble – and with it, every Russian’s life savings – had lost fully 75% ofits value.The devastation of Russia’s economy was worse than what America experienced inthe Great Depression. By 1932, the US gross national product had been cut byalmost one-third. But within just six months of the 1998 crash, Russia’seconomy, measured in dollars, had fallen by more than two-thirds. From $422billion in 1997, Russia’s gross domestic product fell to only $132 billion bythe end of 1998.At the end of 1929, following America’s disastrous stock market crash,unemployment in the United States reached 1.5 million, representing 1.2% of thetotal population. The 1998 collapse of the Russian economy was far worse: 11.3million Russians were jobless at the end of 1998 – 7.7% of the nation’s totalpopulation.In the Crash of 1929, stock prices fell 17% by year end – and 90% by the depthof the Great Depression four years later. By contrast, the Russian stock marketlost 90% of its value in 1998 alone.By March 1999, billions of dollars backed, as usual, by the US taxpayer haddisappeared into the secret bank accounts of both Russian and American gangstercapitalists. Then the IMF washed its hands of any responsibility for whathappened to the enormous sums of money it had poured into Russia so quickly, andwere so quickly siphoned off by government crooks into their foreign bankaccounts.With the collapse of the economy and the banking system, ordinary Russiansfroze, starved and drank themselves to death. According to the House report,more than 500 billion dollars had been looted out of Russia.40 And that wasn’tstockholder equity. It was real hard cash. Within a decade, the population ofRussia had shrunk from an estimated high of 160 million in 1991 to 145 millionpeople. According to the Hoover Institution Policy review, life expectancy of aRussian male had dropped in the year 2000 to around 48 years.41 Those livingbelow the official poverty line, defined as income of less than the roubleequivalent of $500 per year, now formed 41.2 percent of the population.By the dawn of the new century, Russia was a basket case, as badly ruined as ithad been at the worst part of World War II. Dmitri Vasiliev, former chairman ofRussia’s Federal Security Commission, confirmed the unimaginable: “The $10billion IMF money is all spent,” he told the Los Angeles Times a month after thedevaluation. “It went to foreigners and Russian speculators, including theCentral Bank. They got payments for their GKOs, converted the roubles into cheapdollars, and took the money out of the country.”42None of this was accidental or circumstantial. It was “profit taking” on a grandscale. Interpol money-laundering investigators have been quoted as saying thatthe IMF money just visited Russia briefly before returning to the US, leavingall of the debt, with no evident benefit to the economy. One Interpol source,whose name I cannot cite due to security reasons, even hinted that they did notreally know whom to trust for accurate information in Russia, because thehighest levels of government were part of the looting.The more I studied the circumstances of the case, the more one thing becameabsolutely clear: someone at the highest levels of power deemed this moneyexpendable. I needed to find the reason. I have been investigating moneylaundering by organized crime for over a decade, and none of this made anysense. You see, criminal money, dirty money is different from clean money Moneythat is not criminal has to go through regulations and banking systems. It hasto go through taxations. It’s tracked. The lawyers follow it. The governmentfollows it. The regulators follow it. The secret services follow it. Legal moneyis slow money.There is absolutely no way that all this IMF money could have vaporized intothin air. The billions in IMF loans had collapsed the currency, insuring abanking crisis, which wiped out Russia. Someone, somewhere knew where it was andhow it got there. Moreover, this held the key to the rest of the mystery.How do you lose so much money, I kept asking myself again and again? I re-readseveral dozen articles from the American, European and Russian press appearingaround the time the money disappeared. The IMF blamed the Russian government forincompetence, the Russian government blamed the IMF for trying to destroy thecountry, and financial analysts were blaming HIID (Harvard Institute forInternational Development) and the Clinton administration for short-sightednessin their handling of the “loans-for-shares” scam. Yet, none of them dealt withthe consequences of the loss. When the money used to bankroll the luxurious wayof life of the Russian oligarchs disappeared, Russia went belly up. Ordinarypeople froze, starved and drank themselves to death by the millions. And no oneseemed to have been concerned.Major western corporate media groups who picked up on the story blamed Russiangangster capitalists, Mafia bosses and ruthless oligarchs. But there was nofollow-up and no hard-nosed investigative journalism to uncover the money’swhereabouts. It was as if the mainstream press was in collusion with the USgovernment, the IMF and major banking institutions in sweeping the entireepisode under a rug, I thought to myself. Why? As far as I knew, the money wasstill missing, and the hunt was still on.The Wall Street Journal Europe had mentioned that the Swiss Federal Prosecutor’sOffice was involved. That was a very good start. I have done business with theSwiss secret service in the past, and I knew that they were very professionaland extremely tight-lipped. The Swiss were my ticket to getting it right.I weighed my options. In some tough investigations when leads are sparse, thereare times when it becomes necessary to “shake the trees” and see what falls out.It was 2006 and the year 1998 was far removed. Most of the leads had gone stonecold. Some of the witnesses and perhaps even the perpetrators had been rubbedout, or “suicided” as the CIA likes to call it. I called on a few acquaintancesat the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times who, it turned out, had longago lost interest in the story. With the Iraq quagmire front- and-center andIran dangerously looming in the background, you couldn’t blame them.Yep, this would have to be a major “tree shaking.” Only one person could helpme: an old and trusted contact at the world’s largest international policeorganization, Interpol.A little-known fact about Interpol is that the organization grew out ofanticipation of the Second World War. It was organized by the House ofRothschild in Vienna in 1923. The family felt it needed a special intelligenceorganization to watch over the interests of bankers, who were financing bothsides of the war. In order not to make things look too suspicious, they hadearlier in 1914 called on Prince Albert I of Monaco to invite lawyers, judgesand police officers from several countries to discuss international cooperationagainst crime.Today, Interpol is staffed by agents from MI6, MI5, the CIA, Mossad, the formerEast German Stasi and the KGB, to name just a few of the more famousorganizations.My contact listened silently and told me he would be in touch. When he got backto me, the information was worth the wait. According to him, the case was“XD-Top Priority Red Tab,” meaning of utmost importance. Interpol has specialfiles bearing different colored tabs. Red tabs get first priority These meantthat an investigation was in progress against individuals whose immediate arrestwas sought by Interpol. Furthermore, the Swiss Prosecutor’s Office was notworking alone. They were assisted by the Money Laundering Reporting Office(MROS) for Switzerland, which functions as a relay and nexus among financialintermediaries and the law enforcement agencies.If this case was “XD-Red Tab,” I speculated, then Interpol must have namedsuspects. Color tabs are applicable to people, not to organizations. If MROS wasinvolved, then this was a major international investigation into moneylaundering involving at the very least four or five international crimeprevention agencies working in tandem and being coordinated out of Switzerland.My Interpol contact gave me his source’s name at MROS, with very specificprearranged instructions of what must be said to indicate an outsider comingfrom a friendly source. I dialed and waited.According to the source, the only way money could be transferred from account Ato account B was on direct orders from an official in charge of foreign loans.By a process of elimination, it appeared that this mysterious official couldonly be Mikhail Kasianov, then Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister, whose authoritycould move 100 percent of the 1998 IMF loan.ENTER EDMOND SAFRAMy MROS contact, in turn, supplied me with a source at the Swiss Prosecutor’sOffice. What I then learned staggered my mind: the $4.8 billion IMF loan wasformed under “account No. 999091 at the US Federal Reserve Bank on August 14,1998.” The FBI, the Swiss told me, had confirmed that information. From there,the money should have been transferred to the Central Bank of Russia. It nevergot there. Instead, the entire amount was moved to account No. 608555800 at theRepublic National Bank of New York, owned by the self-acclaimed “world’sgreatest banker,” Edmond Safra.When I saw Safra’s name mixed into this, I began to realize the sheer scope ofwhat I was on to. Edmond Safra, one of eight children of a Syrian Jewish bankerwhose ancestors were gold traders in the Ottoman Empire, was one of the mostcolorful characters in the financial world and certainly more than just abanker. He was a gold trader. No, take that back. He was the greatestclandestine gold trader in the history of mankind, suspected at the time, by theFBI, according to Interpol, of being the principal conduit for Russia’s criminalmoney laundering.According to my FBI contacts, the laundered money, in turn, was transferredthrough the Swiss Creditanstalt Bankverein branch, to banks and accounts in noway related to the Russian budget. One of these sums, $2.35 billion out of the$4.8 billion was transferred into the accounts of the Bank of SydneyThrough the Sydney, Australia city directory, I checked for the bank’s address.To my surprise, there was no “Bank of Sydney” I called MROS for the second time.I learned that the Bank of Sydney, which had functioned fromJuly 1996 toSeptember 1998, was an offshore entity unrelated to Australia.The time line was clear enough. The IMF loan was approved in August 1998. Onemonth after the loan was transferred, it disappeared and the account closed.Period. Yet, nobody seemed to have been too concerned. My source at MROSconfirmed my suspicions. “When have you ever heard of a case of vast financialconspiracy against your [Russian] government, and the government itself neverfollowing up on it?” he asked.“Unless, you stole the money in the first place,” I added sarcastically. Therewas more to learn.When the money was transferred into the Swiss Creditanstalt Bankverein branch,Italian money-laundering experts and Russian government investigators out of theAttorney General’s office got involved. What they discovered were connections tothe usual suspects. Part of the money transferred to the Bank of Sydney wasplaced in an account of a company which was 25 percent owned by TatianaD’yachenko, former President Boris Yeltsin’s younger daughter. D’yachenko and asmall group of opportunist people such as Boris Berezovsky, the then-richestRussian oligarch, Valentin Yumashev, head of the Russian Presidentialadministration, and Roman Abramovich, principal and most aggressive ideologue ofthe “family,”43 ruled the country in the name of the President while Yeltsinfaded from the political scene due to his rapidly declining health.44According to the Swiss Prosecutor’s Office, $2.115 billion of this money wasconverted into British pounds and transferred to the National Westminster Bank,where any trace of the money disappeared. A much “smaller” amount of money, $780million, was transferred on August 14, 1998 to the Credit Suisse bank, followedby $270 million transferred to the same bank four days later. These twotransfers attracted the attention of Swiss investigator Loran Casper-Anserme,who together with Geneva prosecutor Bertrossa and Russian investigator NickolaiVolkov joined the investigation.The last $1.4 billion was transferred to the notorious Bank of New York and thento its Geneva branch, Bank of New York-Intermar- itime. However, this was farfrom being the end of the story. The money was deposited into the account of aRussian United Bank owned by Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich, the currentowner of the Chelsea Football Club. At that time, these two oligarchs were thebest of friends.Subsequent events transpired with breathtaking precision. The investigationconcluded that the IMF money was immediately transferred to the account of theSwiss RUNICOM company Through my Interpol contacts I found out that RUNICOM wasregistered in Switzerland at No. 1 De Mulen Street. Company owner? ChelseyFootball Club president, Roman Abramovich.British Special Services had the best report of nefarious RUNICOM activities.They published their report on the Compromat.ru website, categorically stating,“As a result of RUNICOM SA Director Roman Abramovich’s swindling in the courseof privatization of the state-owned Sibneft company in 1995-97, the Russianstate received $2.7 billion less,” contributing significantly to the devastatingeconomic crisis in the country.The investigation, however, was not without casualties. While visiting Russia,the magistrate who launched the Swiss investigation, Laurent Kasper-Ansermet,was found bleeding and unconscious after an attack in St. Petersburg.Investigator Nikolai Volkov, who had joined the Swiss investigation concerningthe loan, was immediately dismissed from the Prosecutor General’s Office by theSwiss government and blacklisted.MURDER IN THE GOLD MARKETBorn in 1932, Edmond Safra was working in finance and trade by the age ofsixteen. After World War II his family moved first to Italy and then Brazil in1952, where he was in business with his father. In 1956 he settled in Geneva,where he launched the private Trade Development Bank. In 1966, he began theRepublic National Bank of New York. For many years, Edmond Safra was listedamong the richest people in the world.His family’s banking and precious-metals empire was built primarily after thecreation of the state of Israel in 1948, with the Safras acting as the savvymoney-managing experts for wealthy Sephardic Jews, the descendants of those whoinitially fled the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th century Mostly MiddleEasterners, whole families desired to extract their fortunes before they movedto Israel.With its base in Lebanon, the original Safra bank catered to many of Syria’s andLebanon’s richest Sephardic Jewish families, who trusted the Safras’ care anddiscretion to manage their financial interests. “Mr Safra, has been able to wintheir loyalty, gathering 30,000 wealthy investors from the Sephardi Diasporafrom not just Syria and Lebanon, where they began, but Iraq and Iran, and theJewish communities of Latin America. In this very tribal group, which has attimes felt politically isolated from more westernized Jews, investing with theSafra bank was a link to both the past and a secure future.”45 To the day ofEdmond Safra’s death, his every financial transaction was conducted in a rareJudaeo-Arabic script, used only by the Sephardic Middle Eastern communities.He died in December 1999, under what were “suspicious circumstances” to say theleast – in a fire that engulfed his Monte Carlo residence after, an ex-GreenBeret nurse/bodyguard claimed, it had been started by two intruders he hadfought off, leaving him wounded. The nurse, Ted Maher, eventually confessed toinflicting knife wounds on himself and setting the fire in what he hoped wouldturn into an opportunity to “rescue” Safra, and thus enhance his hold on verylucrative employment. Maher served several years in a Monaco prison for theoffense.At the time of his death, Safra was finalizing the sale of his entire bankingempire to a British banking conglomerate. What is less known about Safra is thathe was likely the premier clandestine gold trader in the world, financing covertoperations for intelligence agencies such as the Israeli Mossad. Additionally,Safra was evidently the key man in the gold-for-opium trade, supplying verylarge quantities of gold to the Hong Kong market via the Trade Development Bank.The sources for this sensational information will, I am sorry to say, have toremain anonymous at this time.Realizing that he might well be accused of laundering billions from theIMF-Russian loan, and being aware that his life was in danger, either by thosewho stole the money or from Russia’s security forces, the billionaire becameextremely alarmed. Safra understood that the evaporation of the funds had causedthe financial crisis in Russia. To save his life, he sought the protection ofthe US Federal Bureau of Investigations. He told authorities he was ready toshow how Russian officials were laundering $4.8 billion of the IMF stabilizationloans. In the summer of 1999, Safra started giving the FBI concrete evidence ofhow the money was laundered and who did it, revealing the names of Russian topofficials and tycoons.Given the problematic nature of his demise, it is no surprise that it hasinvoked its share of notoriety, even in the mainstream press. The following isfrom a 2004 article on the missing IMF funds in London’s Times:A sinister footnote to the investigation came in the fate of the banker EdmondSafra, 67.Swiss investigators noted Mr. Safra had been questioned by the FBI in connectionwith unusual movements of funds originating from the IMF. After Mr. Safra begancooperating with the FBI, he hid in a penthouse flat in Monte Carlo. He diedwhen an inferno turned his fortress-like retreat into a pile of cinders.The official explanation, that his nurse started the fire with a candle, failedto explain how an unknown man’s DNA was found under Mr. Safra’s fingernails.There was speculation that he had tried to fend off an attacker. The nurse wassentenced to ten years’ imprisonment for arson.46CONNECTING DRUGS, MONEY LAUNDERING AND BIG-TIME BANKINGAccording to a US Congressional Investigation conducted in 2001, “US andEuropean banks launder between $500 billion and $i trillion of internationalcriminal proceeds each year, half of which is laundered by US banks alone. It isestimated that half of that money comes to the United States,” claims MichiganSenator Carl Levin. In other words, during the 1990s, between $2.5 and $5trillion (laundered criminal and corrupt money) had been laundered by US banksand circulated in the US financial circuits.What does it all mean?Without its illegal money, the US economy would collapse onto itself. As itstands, the US trade deficit is close to $900 billion. Now, compare it to thelaundered money of between $250 and $500 billion per year. Dirty money coverspart of the US deficit in its balance of trade. “Without the ‘dirty money,’”stated James Petras, a professor at Binghamton University, “the US economyexternal accounts would be totally unsustainable, living standards wouldplummet, the dollar would weaken, the available investment and loan capitalwould shrink, and Washington would not be able to sustain its global empire.”47Tough banking disclosure laws could put an end to the multibil- lion-dollar flowliterally overnight. How much is $500 billion of criminal and dirty moneyflowing into and through the major US banks? It exceeds the net revenues of allthe IT companies in the United States as well as all the net transfers by themajor US oil producers, military industries and airplane manufacturers.Intimately involved in the money-laundering business are the most importantbanks in the US, sustaining America’s global power through money laundering andmanagement of illegally obtained overseas funds. Again quoting James Petras inthe same source, “Washington and the mass media have portrayed the US as beingin the forefront of the struggle against narco trafficking, drug laundering andpolitical corruption: the image is of clean white hands fighting dirty money.The truth is exactly the opposite. US banks have developed a highly elaborateset of policies for transferring illicit funds to the US, investing those fundsin legitimate businesses or US government bonds and legitimizing them.”There are two methods that premier banking institutions use to launder money:through private banks and through correspondent banking.Private banking caters to extremely wealthy clients, requiring minimum depositsof $i million. Private banks are very attractive for money laundering becausemore than financial advice, they sell confidentiality to dirty-money clients.Private banks routinely use code names for accounts, establish “concentrationaccounts” which co-mingle bank funds with client funds (cutting off paper trailsfor billions of dollars of wire transfers), and set up offshore privateinvestment corporations (PICs) in countries with strict secrecy laws, such asthe Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, etc.The second, and related, route that the big banks use to launder hundreds ofbillions of dirty money, is through “correspondent banking,” a financialtechnique wherein illicit money is moved from bank to bank with “no questionsasked,” thereby cleansing funds prior to being used for legitimate purposes. Incorrespondent banking, one bank simply provides services to another in movingfunds, exchanging currencies or carrying out other financial transactions. Sincethis is what banks do, why would a bank incur additional cost by hiring anotherto do the work? According to US Congressional Hearings, these accounts “give theowners and clients of poorly regulated, poorly managed, sometimes corruptforeign banks, with weak or no anti-money laundering controls, direct access tothe US financial system and the freedom to move money within the United Statesand around the world.”48 Needless to say, some of these customers would includedrug dealers and others engaged in criminal activity.It is no surprise that most of the offshore banks laundering billions forcriminal clients have accounts in the US. Some of the biggest banks specializingin international-fund transfer process up to $i trillion in wire transfers perdayAccording to reports from the Associated Press, Reuters, Interpol and AgenceFrance-Presse, one of the banks involved in laundering as much as $15 billionworth of Russian organized crime and capital flight money was the Bank of NewYork [BoNY]. BoNY was founded in 1784 by Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretaryof the Treasury of the United States. It is one of the oldest banks in theworld, and the sixteenth largest bank in the United States, based on totalassets. According to a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of shareholders ofthe Bank of New York Company, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank ofNew York, BoNY “acting as primary Western correspondent bank for theMafia-controlled Inkombank, earned as much as $250 million a month in fees,49and certain of its officers earned illicit income, in exchange for wrongfullyproviding the Russian ‘oligarchs’ with powerful connections to the Kremlin andto Russian-organized crime factions in control of Inkombank, with unrestrictedaccess to the Western banking system, thereby knowingly facilitatingmoney-laundering, multi-billion dollar conversion of assets and capitalflight.”50Apparently, BoNY became the US correspondent bank of choice for at least 160gangster Russian banks. In the weeks leading up to the August 1998 Russianfinancial crisis, which led to the devaluation of the rouble, BoNY generated anaverage of $3.7 billion in daily transactions with those banks. The class actioncomplaint categorically states, “This laundering process was substantiallyenhanced by passing those funds through a major bank in the US banking system,because the size, speed and efficiency of that system helped immeasurably to‘cover the tracks’ of the laundering operations.”51 In addition, BoNY’s staturein the banking community would cloak the unlawful transactions with a veneer oflegitimacyI checked the full Board of Directors list of the Bank of New York atwww.sec.gov [http://www.sec.gov] using the EDGAR data base. Then I cross-referenced it with the Federal Elections Commissions databases at theirrespective websites. The interrelationship of those directors, as well as BoNY’sinvestment stake/loan exposure in many other firms, helped me understand theseconvoluted relationships much better. Many of the major corporate donors of theRepublican and the Democratic Parties, as well as leading financial institutionsand Wall Street corporations, were interlocked with the very individuals undercriminal indictment. For example, BoNY Board member John C. Malone sat on manyother boards including those of Tele Communications, Inc., where he served foryears with former chief Al Gore fundraiser, Tony Cohelo. Malone also hadconnections to Viacom, which bought CBS television, whose financial expansionwas supervised for a long time by Brown Brothers Harriman and its seniorpartner, Prescott Bush: father and grandfather to future presidents and a majorsponsor of Nazi Germany.For a waiver of any further US liability in the money-laundering affair, BoNYsettled in late 2005 with federal regulators for $38 million, roughly i% of itsvalue calculated shortly thereafter, in April 2006, in a complicated swap ofassets with J.P. Morgan Chase. In May 2007, Russia sued the bank in its owncourts for $22.5 billion on charges of money laundering.52The financial finagling of course has not been restricted to the BoNY affair.The post-perestroika, post-Yeltsin Russian Federation, not exactly unschooled inthe way of corruption, quickly took advantage of the new system; call itglasnost, openness, opportunism or money laundering. Overnight, thanks toClinton and the IFM policies, Russia was awash in dirty money, dirty politicsand dirty political vendettas. It didn’t take long for the governmentbureaucrats, the politicians, the KGB-controlled Mafia and a newly wealthyclique of oligarchs to join in the Shadow Masters’ agenda of turning Russia froma superpower into a cleptocracy.Is it any wonder that the Russian people would find the austere autocracy of anationalist like Vladimir Putin to be a change for the better?Notes1. As Claire Sterling, author of Thieves’ World: The Threat of The New GlobalNetwork of Organized Crime, put it, “On January 23, 1991, a British‘businessman’ named Paul Pearson was picked up at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo airport.In his briefcase was a signed contract, endorsed by the government of theRussian Federation, proposing the illegal exchange of 140 billion roubles forUS$7.8 billion. The two noteworthy aspects of this deal were (a) 140bn roubleswas more than all the cash then physically circulating in Russia and (b) at thethen official exchange rate, this sum was worth not $7.8bn but $224bn.British-born ‘businessman’ Colin Gibbins, based in the then pariah-state ofSouth Africa, was also involved in the 140 billion rouble contract whosesignatory on the Russian side was an A.A. Sveridov, a high official fromChelyabinsk, at the centre of Russia’s military-industrial complex in the Uralmountains. He signed on behalf of the ‘Ekho Manufacturing Ecological Company’[sic] and a dubious charity called ‘Eternal Memory to Soldiers.’ RussianFederation deputy Prime Minister, Gennady Filshin, had arranged to provide theroubles from the state budget. Yeltsin in person authorized such black marketswaps, as the only practical way of luring foreign capital to his bankruptcountry.”2.

The empire expects nothing less.Australian journalist John Pilger, New StatesmanSLOBO RULES?In 1996, the Bilderbergers decided to get rid of then-Serbian president SlobodanMiloševic. Their master plan was put together during the 1996 meeting in KingCity, a small luxury town about 35 kilometers north of Toronto in Ontario,Canada. The Kosovo War and the subsequent overthrow of the Yugoslav presidentoccurred because of political strategies secretly conceived at this BilderbergGroup conference. Their agenda was clear. When the time was right, they intendedto implement their plan to solve the “political problem” that Miloševic’spolitical survival and continued socialist policies created in his rejection oftheir capitalist goals: to turn all of Europe into a “free market.”In the article quoted above, John Pilger revealed how the US and Germany hadbegun supporting secessionist forces in Yugoslavia after the collapse ofCommunism in the former Soviet Union, when the Yugoslav federation refused to bebrought wholly into the Western orbit.1 Neil Clark, who specializes in MiddleEastern and Balkan affairs, provided specifics: “Over 700,000 Yugoslaventerprises, at the time, remained in social ownership and most were stillcontrolled by employee-management committees, with only 5% of capital privatelyowned.”2Sara Flounders, an activist and journalist aligned to the Workers World Party,reported on this as early as 1998: “Throughout the ‘90s, as the capitalistmarket has swept over the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe and theSoviet Union, socialist Yugoslavia has attempted to resist privatization of itsindustry and natural resources. To break this resistance, the Western countrieshave played a major role in the break-up of socialist Yugoslavia…. The lendingand credit conditions of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bankrequire the break-up of all state-owned industries. This is true for the oil andnatural gas wealth in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea as well as the diamondmines of Siberia. The decision on who will own or have controlling interest …will be made by whoever wins the armed struggle raging in Kosovo. NATOdomination on the ground would have put US corporations in the best ownershipposition.”3Tim Marshall, a British reporter, had impressive connections in the formerYugoslavia among secret service agents who were planning its overthrow. InMarshall’s book, Shadowplay, Mark Kirk, a US Naval Intelligence officer, isquoted on the conflict in Kosovo: “Eventually, we opened up a huge operationagainst Miloševic, both secret and open. The secret part of the operationinvolved not only things like staffing the various observer missions, which weresent into Kosovo with officers from the British and American intelligenceservices, but also— crucially – giving military, technical, financial,logistical and political support to the KLA [Kosovo Liberation Army],” The KLAis a terrorist organization which, according to Marshall, “smuggled drugs, ranprostitution rackets and murdered civilians.”In late 1998, Miloševic, in an effort to stave off the destruction and latersplintering of what was left of Yugoslavia, agreed to let the Kosovo DiplomaticObserver Mission enter Kosovo to monitor the situation in the province. TheKosovo Diplomatic Mission (KDOM) was an undercover CIA operation staffed with2,000 specially trained British and American intelligence agents, Special Forcesand “deep surveillance” operatives. The KDOM was run by a Bilderbergcontrolledbody, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. This is aregional security organization, founded in 1975 and supervised by the CIA, thatprides itself on conflict prevention, conflict resolution and post-conflictreconstruction. The Yugoslavs knew perfectly well what was going on, but werepowerless to stop it.The Bilderberg organs insisted upon prosecuting, in a new international court,alleged war criminals among the Serbian populace, fully expecting to inciteenough violent response to justify military intervention. The Serbs cleverlydefused the situation by persuading the less important suspects to surrendervoluntarily. Something more was needed. To further enrage the Serbs, theUS-controlled Hague Tribunal resorted to illegal kidnappings (“Snatch Squads,”as Henry Kissinger referred to them at the 1996 Bilderberg conference) to bringabout the war.After the 1996 Bilderberg Conference in King City, Ontario, Canada, we warnedanyone willing to listen: “If the Bilderbergers could not get such a war goingby inflaming the Serbs through the use of NATO ‘Snatch Squads’ to seizesuspected war criminals for trial at The Hague, their plan was to use Kosovo asthe flashpoint to ignite a regional conflict, which would ultimately embroil theYugoslav federation, Bosnia, Russia, Greece, Turkey, Albania, Macedonia, theWestern European military powers, the United States, and by extension – asallies of Turkey and Greece – Israel and Syria.”A knowledgeable Greek source present at the meeting, not as a member of theBilderberg Group but rather as one of the support staff, had drawn my attentionto the vast pool of oil reported to underlie the relatively shallow Aegean Sea.He suggested that this, in fact, is the primary reason why the US is furtheringa “peace” policy in the region that actually increases the chances of warbetween Turkey and Greece: such a conflict might well then give theBilderbergers an excuse to garrison the disputed area with UN peacekeepers andthus ensure their ultimate control over the exploitation of this treasure-troveof untapped oil reserves. If so, that would explain why the US Ambassador to theUnited Nations from 1999 to 2001, Richard Holbrooke, “father of the November1995 Dayton Agreement,” which ended the Bosnian war, was busy upsetting Greeksand Greek-Cypriots, why the US was still busily feeding weapons to both sides,and why Bilderberger Bill Clinton was so eager to link the Cyprus issue with anAegean settlement.4It would also explain why Holbrooke, a Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) andBilderberg member as well as a recipient of six Nobel Peace Prize nominations,inserted a clause in the final Bosnia agreement regarding Kosovo. What didKosovo have to do with Bosnia? Nothing. Except that Holbrooke’s agreement was tobecome a blueprint for further Bilderberg expansion in the Balkans. In a columntitled, “Dayton Sellout,” in the Dec. 7, 1995 Arizona Republic, journalist BobDjurdjevic – an internationally renowned specialist on the Balkans and afrequent contributor to the Washington Times, a newspaper with close militaryties to the Pentagon – called this expansion a “Green Interstate, anethnic/geopolitical highway with a dual carriage and a dual purpose”: on the onehand, “connecting NATO West with NATO East (Turkey),” and on the other,“projecting the Islamic influence into the soft underbelly of Christian Europe.”Historically, both the Albanian and Bosnian populations consisted of Serbs whohad forcibly or voluntarily converted to Islam to avoid Turkish persecution.In another article, Djurdjevic described ominous signs “provided by the KosovoAlbanians themselves. They have been boycotting all Serbian elections since thefall of Communism in 1990. This sent a clear signal that they were planning toachieve their political aims by bullets, not ballots. A steady flow of arms intoKosovo, financed in part by the Albanians’ drug trafficking operations …reinforced the assessment that it was just a matter of time before Kosovoexploded in violence.”5Michel Chossudovsky, Professor of Economics at the University of Ottawa inCanada, details the secret German and American plan to re-colonize the regionfollowing the Kosovo War: “The fate of Kosovo had already been carefully laidout prior to the signing of the 1995 Dayton agreement. NATO had entered anunwholesome ‘marriage of convenience’ with the Mafia … the narcotics tradeenabled Washington and Bonn to ‘finance the Kosovo conflict’ with the ultimateobjective of destabilizing the Belgrade government and fully re-colonizing theBalkans.”6But I am jumping ahead of myself.THE SNATCHED SUCCOMBThe Truth in Media Global Watch Bulletin of July 1, 1998, reported a number ofuntoward events occurring to Serbs unfortunate enough to fall into the hands ofthe “peacekeepers”: “Slavko Dokmanovic, the former Serb mayor of Vukovar who wastricked, kidnapped, and shipped off to the ‘NWO Bastille’ in the Hague a yearago, committed suicide in his prison cell on June 29, a year after he wasabducted by 20 masked New World Order commandos…. In February 1996, twounindicted senior Serb military officials were similarly kidnapped and whiskedoff to The Hague, where they were held illegally without charges. Gen. DjordjeDjukic was later released on account of his poor health. He died in April 1996of cancer…. In January 1997, Dr. Nikola Koljevic, vice president of the BosnianSerb Republic and one of the chief Serb negotiators at Dayton, also committedsuicide. His motives were unclear. 7 Neither Dokmanovic nor Gen. Djukic nor Dr.Koljevic had been on the published list of people indicted by the War CrimesTribunal. Yet all of them are dead now.8When illegal kidnappings failed to incite a Balkan war, our sources within theBilderberg Group said, they were prepared to utilize Kosovo to accomplish thatobjective. The alleged massacre at Racak began the process. This was followed bythe bogus settlement negotiations at Rambouillet.The head of the undercover CIA operation dubbed the Kosovo Diplomatic ObserverMission (whose outward assignment was to monitor the situation in Kosovo) wasWilliam Walker, a former ambassador to El Salvador (whose US-supportedgovernment ran death squads) and a CFR member. In 1985, as deputy assistantsecretary of state for Central America, Walker was a key operator in the ReaganWhite House’s operation to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, run byLieutenant Colonel Oliver North and Assistant Secretary of State Elliot Abrams.North had been assigned to the National Security Council staff beginning in 1981until he was fired on November 25, 1986, and was the White House official mostdirectly involved in secretly aiding the Nicaraguan Contras,9 selling arms toIran, and diverting Iran arms sales proceeds to the Contras. North claimed tohave taken much of his direction from Central Intelligence Agency DirectorWilliam Casey, who died at the height of the investigation from a cancerousbrain tumor.In 1991, Abrams, a disciple of Bilderberger Richard N. Perle, was investigatedby the Iran-Contra special prosecutor for giving false testimony before Congressin 1987 about his role in illicitly raising money for the Contras. Avoidingindictment, he entered into a plea agreement on two misdemeanor charges ofwithholding information from Congress. He paid a $50 fine, and was sentenced twoyears of probation and 100 hours of community service. In December 1992, as hewas about to leave office, President George H.W. Bush pardoned Abrams, alongwith five other Reagan administration officials involved in Iran-Contra.With this track record, how could George W. Bush not have jumped at theopportunity of bringing Abrams into his administration? The odd thing is that ittook almost a year. On Dec. 3, 2002, Elliot Abrams was appointed SpecialAssistant to the President and Senior Director for Near East and North AfricanAffairs, which included Arab/Israel relations and any US efforts to promotepeace and security in the region. What is even more curious about thisadjudicated criminal is that he served as President of the Ethics and PublicPolicy Center from 1996 to 2001.According to court records, CFR member Walker was responsible for setting up aphony humanitarian operation at an airbase in Ilopango, El Salvador. The airbasewas secretly used to run guns, cocaine, ammunition and supplies to the Contrarebels in Nicaragua.10 It was also Walker who “discovered” the “massacre” in thevillage of Racak in January 1999, the event that led to NATO’s decision tocommence bombing Serbia on March 24th.11 Although the mainstream press,represented by the New York Times, Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post,were aware of Walker’s illegal actions in Nicaragua, they decided againstbringing his past activities into the open. In fact, lack of media interest ingetting to the bottom of what happened isn’t new, and should surprise no onereading this book.12A January 20, 1999, New York Times editorial observed that the Racak “massacre”followed “a well-established pattern: Albanian guerrillas in the KosovoLiberation Army kill a Serb policeman or two. Serb forces retaliate byflattening a village. This time they took the lives of more than 40 ethnicAlbanians, including many elderly and one child.”George Szamuely described the scene: “On January 15, 1999, following a militaryoperation by Yugoslav armed forces against a KLA stronghold at Racak, KLAleaders had led observers of the Organization for Security and Co-operation inEurope (OSCE) to a gully where 45 bodies were piled on top of each other.Without waiting for any investigation, the United States, through AmbassadorWilliam Walker, immediately announced that the Serbs had carried out a massacreof unarmed Kosovo Albanian civilians.”13William Norman Grigg, writing in the New American on March 15, 1999, reportedthat “rather than a pitiless attack on helpless villagers, the unedited filmdepicts a fire fight between police and encircled KLA guerrillas, with thelatter group getting by far the worst of the engagement.” Further complicatingthings about the “official” account are the number of “journalists who foundonly very few cartridges around the ditch where the massacre supposedly tookplace.”“What really happened?” asks Renaud Girard in Le Figaro. “During the night,could the KLA have gathered the bodies, in fact killed by Serb bullets, to setup a [phony] scene of cold-blooded massacre?”Christophe Chatelot, in a January 21st dispatch from Kosovo, expressed similarscepticism in Le Monde, an anti-Serb publication. “Isn’t the Racak massacre justtoo perfect?” inquired Chatelot. “How could the Serb police have gathered agroup of men and led them calmly toward the execution site, while they wereconstantly under fire from [KLA] fighters? How could the ditch located on theedge of Racak [where the massacre victims were later found] have escaped noticeby local inhabitants familiar with the surroundings who were present beforenightfall? Or by the observers who were present for over two hours in this tinyvillage? Why so few cartridges around the corpses, so little blood in the hollowroad where twenty-three people are supposed to have been shot at close rangewith several bullets in the head? Rather, weren’t the bodies of the Albanianskilled in combat by the Serb police gathered into the ditch to create a horrorscene, which was sure to have an appalling effect on public opinion?”According to George Szamuely, writing in 2004, “On March 17, 1999, a week beforeits onslaught on Yugoslavia, NATO organized a press conference at which HelenaRanta, the leader of the Finnish forensic team hired by the OSCE to investigateRacak, announced her findings. Though the Finnish team’s report was neverpublished, the US government, with the New York Times in tow, touted herinconclusive findings as confirmation of William Walker’s initial statement thata massacre had taken place at Racak.14Walker, accused gun-runner turned peace observer, had screamed to the worldpress that Serb police were guilty of “the most horrendous” massacre imaginable.The Serbs, who had very skillfully avoided NATO/Bilderberg provocations up tothen, were “had.” The supposed “massacre” triggered a pretext for intervention.On January 30th, the NATO Council authorized Secretary General Javier Solana to“use armed force to compel Serbian and ethnic Albanian delegates to ‘peace’negotiations in France to discuss a framework for Kosovo ‘autonomy.’”In fact, as skilled as the Serbs were in side-stepping armed confrontation withNATO, the plan of attack was drawn long before the Racak incident. The US SenateRepublican Policy Committee in its secret report released August 12, 1998, notedthat “planning for a US-led NATO intervention in Kosovo is now largely inplace…. The only missing element seems to be an event – with suitably vividmedia coverage – that would make the intervention politically sellable.”Anyone observant enough could have easily guessed this was the pretext theBilderberg-controlled NATO needed to intervene. The August 4th Washington Post(the newspaper and its owner are Bilderberg full-time members) quoted “a seniorUS Defense Department official who listed only one thing that might trigger apolicy change [toward intervention]: ‘I think if some levels of atrocities werereached that would be intolerable, that would probably be a trigger.’”Helena Ranta evidently revealed the pressure she was under to make her findingsconform to NATO requirements. George Szamuely quoted an interview she gave tothe Berliner Zeitung: “KLAfighters [were] buried around Racak. At that time Ireceived information that proved that several Serb soldiers had been killed aswell. Unfortunately, we will never know the exact number of Serb soldiers thatdied that night. When Ambassador Walker said that there was a massacre at Racak,this statement had no legal value. I declared at that time that theOSCE-observers forgot to take all steps necessary to secure a crime scene:isolating the area, refusing admission to all unauthorized persons andcollecting all material evidence.… A bunch of governments were interested in aversion of Racak that blamed only the Serb side. But I could not provide thisversion.”Among the confusion there is at least one certainty: William Walker’s role inthe affair was so important that the country road in Kosovo which leads to Racakhas now been renamed after him.15ETHNIC CLEANSING – TRUTH OR FALSEHOOD?The question of mass murder cuts to the heart of the intervention in Kosovo. TheSerbs were guilty of murdering innocent civilians, as were the Croats, Bosnians,Macedonians and the KLA. Intentional provocation of racial tensions in a landthat has been the epicenter of two world wars can hardly be a positiveoccurrence. In WWII, entire Serb villages were burned and their inhabitantsburied alive by the Croat sympathizers of the Nazi regime. Serb partisans hadalso done their share of raping and murdering of Croat and Bosnian villages. Warcauses massive movements of threatened populations. And in the Balkan wars,there were plenty of those.But these dislocations were not in themselves the alliance’s justification formilitary intervention. The justification was the apparent “discovery” of secretand detailed plans worked out by the Miloševic regime in 1998 for the ethniccleansing of Kosovo-Albanians by the Yugoslav regular army and paramilitarygroups. According to NATO, the war would cut short this operation. The Germanmilitary took the lead in promoting the deception.But the German Section of the International Association of Lawyers AgainstNuclear Arms (IALANA) saw through the smokescreen, simply because the “plan”first became known only after March 24, 1999, that is once the bombing campaignhad gotten under way: “In its press statement, even the Foreign Ministry admitsthat it had become aware of the existence of such a plan only on April 1,1999.”16And there was at least one chink in the media’s wall of indifference,appropriately enough in Germany itself:The existence and content of the Horseshoe plan was – like so many otherelements of NATO’s war propaganda – generally treated as fact by the media. Itscontent and sources were hardly checked. The only exception I found was anarticle published on May 19 by the foreign editor of the German dailyFrankfurter Rundschau, Karl Grobe.Grobe makes clear that the origins, sources and content of the Horseshoe planare very mysterious, and that even if such a plan actually existed, it couldhardly be interpreted as a blueprint for the expulsion of the civilianpopulation from Kosovo.The press was informed about the plan in the third week of the war by generalinspector Hans Peter von Kirchbach, the highest commander of the Bundeswehr, theGerman army. Kirchbach refused to give any information on the sources of theplan, because they were “too sensitive.” The news agency AP later quoted“experts” who “thought” that it was leaked by a deserter or originated fromsecret service sources.German defense minister Rudolf Scharping claimed that the plan had been agreedon by Yugoslav President Slobodan Miloševic and the Yugoslav military leadershipin December 1998. Its main aim was, according to Sharping, to “smash orneutralise” the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) and to expel the Albanian civilianpopulation from Kosovo.17Any credibility this story may have had was further undermined in a book by aretired German officer, Der Kosovo-Konflikt. Wege in einen vermeidbaren Krieg[The Kosovo Conflict: Road to an Avoidable War] (Baden-Baden: Nomos, 2000):“Heinz Loquai, a retired brigadier general, has claimed in a new book on the warthat the plan was fabricated from run-of-the-mill Bulgarian intelligencereports. Loquai, who now works for the Organization for Security andCo-operation in Europe (OSCE), has accused Rudolf Scharping, the German defenseminister, of obscuring the origins of Operation Horseshoe…. Loquai has claimedthat the German defense ministry turned a vague report from Sofia into a ‘plan,’and even coined the name Horseshoe. Die Woche [a German news weekly] hasreported that maps broadcast around the world as proof of NATO’s informationwere drawn up at the German defense headquarters in Hardthöhe…. The Bulgarianreport concluded that the goal of the Serbian military was to destroy the KosovoLiberation Army, and not to expel the entire Albanian population, as was laterargued by Scharping and the NATO leadership.”18PEACE CONFERENCE AT RAMBOUILLETIn February 1999, to avoid being bombed into oblivion by a vastly superiorcombined NATO forces, the Serbs were compelled to participate in negotiations atRambouillet, near Paris. US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright (Bilderberg,CFR) led the negotiations. “The Serbs were confronted with the choice of eitheraccepting the text of the agreement unconditionally, or of being dragged into awar against NATO. The manner in which the negotiations were set up made italmost impossible to avoid the latter alternative,” wrote journalist Bo Pellnäsin the Swedish newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, February 8, 2004.19Under the terms presented at Rambouillet, Kosovo would have virtually become aNATO colony. But, according to Michael Parenti, the West was evidently fearfulthat Miloševic might yet accept these difficult terms “to avoid a full-scaleNATO onslaught on the rest of Yugoslavia.” Therefore, to insure that war wasinevitable, the American delegation added a “remarkable stipulation,” known asAnnex B: “NATO forces and personnel were to have unrestrained access to all ofYugoslavia, unfettered use of its airports, rails, ports, telecommunicationservices, and airwaves, all free of cost and immune from any jurisdiction byYugoslav authorities. NATO would also have the option to modify for its own useall of Yugoslavia’s infrastructure including roads, bridges, tunnels, buildings,and utility systems. In effect, not just Kosovo but all of Yugoslavia was to besubjected to an extraterritoriality tantamount to outright colonialoccupation.”20John Pilger’s conclusion? “This demanded the military occupation of the whole ofYugoslavia, a country with bitter memories of the Nazi occupation. As theBritish Foreign Office minister Lord Gilbert later conceded to a Commons DefenseSelect Committee, Annex B was planted deliberately to provoke rejection.”21The government of the sovereign state of Serbia, although fully recognizing theconsequences of its actions, had no recourse other than rejection of thehumiliating proposal, as expected.ENTER THE KLAThe Albanian underground group Kosovo Liberation Army is, without any questions,a terrorist group.Agence France Presse, 2/23/98The Clinton administration’s then-special envoy for Kosovo, Robert Gelbard, madethis statement before the KLA became a US geopolitical asset. From virtuallynowhere, the well-financed Kosovo Liberation Army had sprung into the limelight,and once again the Balkans were being prepared for a war of great carnage.On the heels of the 1996 Bilderberger meeting in King City, near Toronto,Canada, I had predicted this. Furthermore, a number of respected media sourcesin the US and Europe have documented the Kosovo Liberation Army and theirAlbanian sponsors to be heroinfinanced organized-crime groups hoping to dominatethe flow of Middle Eastern heroin into Europe and the US.As the Christian Science Monitor had reported on Oct. 20, 1994, “Disrupted bythe Yugoslav conflict, drug trafficking across the Balkans is making a comebackas Albanian mafia barons carve out a new smuggling route to Western Europe,bypassing the peninsula’s war zones, according to United Nations and othernarcotics experts…. For example, just 6 kilograms of hard drugs were seized byHungarian police in 1990, but by August this year [1994] the figure had risen to600 kilograms.”Great Britain’s Jane’s Intelligence Review, one of the world’s foremostinvestigative journals, went even deeper in predicting the coming crisis in anarticle entitled, “The Balkan Medellin,” published February 1, 1995. It includedthe following:A great deal of revenue is thought to derive from Albanian narco-terrorism aswell as associated gun-running and cross-border smuggling to and from Albania,Bulgaria and the Kosovo province of Serbia. Although its extent and forms remainin dispute, this rising Albanian economic power is helping to turn the Balkansinto a hub of criminality.Previously transported to Western Europe through former Yugoslavia, heroin fromTurkey, the Transcaucus and points further east is now being increasingly routedto Italy via the Black Sea, Albania, Bulgaria and Macedonia. This is adevelopment that has strengthened the Albanian Mafia, which is now thought tocontrol 70% of the illegal heroin market in Germany and Switzerland….If left unchecked, this growing Albanian narco-terrorism could lead to aColombian syndrome in the Southern Balkans, or the emergence of a situation inwhich the Albanian Mafia becomes powerful enough to control one or more statesin the region.According to a report marked Top Secret that I was shown by a deep undercover“Q” Clearance CIA officer stationed in Europe (Q clearance permits the holder tohave access to documents dealing with atomic energy, restricted data, formerlyrestricted data and national security information at the Confidential, Secretand Top Secret levels) in 1996 the Bilderbergers used the CIA and the GermanFederal Intelligence Service (the Bundesnachrichtendienst, or BND) to covertlyrecruit, arm and train the Kosovo Liberation Army through a series of frontcompanies located mainly in Germany. The companies were used to pump money intoaccounts in Switzerland held by Albanian sympathizers, in preparation for theirplanned Balkans war.The choice to involve Germany in order to destabilize the Serbs and supply theKLA with arms and training has its roots in German-Serb enmity going back tobefore the World Wars of the last century. The Serbs blocked the Berlin-Baghdadrailway project (for oil) before World War I, and predominantly Serb Yugoslavianforces valiantly held off the Nazis for quite a while at the outset of World WarII. In 1941, Nazi Germany finally took control of the Trepca mining complex,insuring a supply of minerals essential for German U-boat batteries.HIDDEN ORIGINS OF THE KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMYAccording to a US Department of Defense briefing of July 15, 1998, “initialcontacts” between the KLA and NATO took place in mid-1998, during the first partof CFR member General Wesley Clark’s mandate as NATO Commander in Chief: “… therealization has come to people [in NATO] that we [NATO led by Wesley Clark] haveto have the UCK [acronym for KLA in Albanian] involved in this process becausethey have shown at least the potential to be rejectionists of any deal thatcould be worked out there with the existing Kosovo parties. So somehow they haveto be brought in and that’s why we’ve made some initial contacts there with thegroup, hopefully the right people in the group, to try and bring them into thisnegotiating process.”22I emphasized that phrase because, of course, “the right people” are those whowill follow orders. As professor Michel Chossudovsky, in an article titled“Kosovo freedom fighters financed by organized crime,” observed in 1999, “Thewest was relying on its KLA puppets to rubber-stamp an agreement, which wouldhave transformed Kosovo into an occupied territory under Westernadministration.”23The framework for KLA operations was designed at the 1996 Bilderberg Conference,whose Kosovo intervention forum debate was attended, among others, by HenryKissinger, US Secretary of Defense William J. Perry, Lord Carrington, the Queenof Spain, Richard Holbrooke, George Soros, George Stephanopoulos (representingPresident Clinton) and Vice President Gore, as well as David Rockefeller, whohas attended almost every Bilderberg Group meeting.The job of carrying out its detailed plan of operations fell to HansjoergGeiger, who was appointed that year at the insistence of the Bilderbergers asthe new head of Germany’s BND. In order to set the entire operation in motion,it was first necessary to establish BND regional stations in Tirana, theAlbanian capital, where a pre-selection process enlisted useful recruits for theKLA terrorist organization’s “command structure from the estimated 500,000Kosovars in Albania,” reported the Truth in Media weekly news bulletin forOctober 24, 1998.Yet, the Germans weren’t the only ones involved in the concerted effort toprovoke a full-scale war. The CIA’s covert participation was reinforced withBritain’s Secret Intelligence Services MI6 and SAS Special Forces, as well asthe US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), together with “former and servingmembers of 22 SAS [Britain’s 22nd Special Air Services Regiment], as well asthree British and American private security companies,” stated Scotland’snational newspaper, the Scotsman, on August 29, 1999. The paper was veryspecific about the role the US government played: “The rag-tag Kosovar Albanianrebels were taken in hand by the Virginia-based company of professionalsoldiers, Military Professional Resources Inc. (MPRI). [MPRI was paid by theAlbanian government.] An outfit of former US marines, helicopter pilots andspecial forces teams, MPRI’s missions for the US government have run from flyingColombian helicopter gunships to supplying weapons to the Croatian army.”The involvement of the Albanian government isn’t surprising. Tomislav Kersovic,a member of the Belgrade-based Institute for Geo-Political Studies, has publiclyproduced documents that demonstrate finances to subsidize the KLA were providedthrough an Albanian foundation known as “Fatherland’s Call,” with active officesin Dusseldorf, Bonn, Stockholm, Bern and other European capitals, according toAnthony Wayne, reporting in April 1999.24Returning to the Scotsman’s report: “The US DIA approached MI6 to arrange atraining program for the KLA, said a senior British military source. ‘MI6 thensub-contracted the operation to two British security companies, who in turnapproached a number of former members of the (22 SAS) regiment. Lists were thendrawn up of weapons and equipment needed by the KLA.’ While these covertoperations were continuing, serving members of 22 SAS Regiment, mostly from theunit’s D Squadron, were first deployed in Kosovo before the beginning of thebombing campaign in March [1999].”Secret agent Michael Levine, formerly of the Drug Enforcement Administration,made the following disheartening observation in the New American magazine, onMay 24, 1999: “Ten years ago we were arming and equipping the worst elements ofthe Mujahideen in Afghanistan – drug traffickers, arms smugglers, anti-Americanterrorists …. Now we’re doing the same thing with the KLA, which is tied in withevery known middle and far eastern drug cartel. Interpol, Europol, and nearlyevery European intelligence and counternarcotics agency has files open on drugsyndicates that lead right to the KLA, and right to Albanian gangs in thiscountry.”25The Bilderbergers needed their war, and they weren’t going to let grass growunder their feet waiting for one to start. MI6, SAS Special Forces, and the USDefense Intelligence Agency, together with three British and American privatesecurity companies, were busy training the KLA terrorists in Northern Albania.In addition, Chris Stephen reported in November 1998 in Britain’s Sunday Timesthat military instructors from Turkey and Afghanistan financed by the “Islamicjihad” were providing the KLA with guerrilla and diversion tactics: “Bin Ladenhad visited Albania himself. His was one of several fundamentalist groups thathad sent units to fight in Kosovo…. Bin Laden is believed to have established anoperation in Albania in 1994…. Albanian sources say Sali Berisha, who was thenpresident, had links with some groups that later proved to be extremefundamentalists.”26BIN LADEN AND THE KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMYAlthough, President Clinton and his Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright,tried mightily to build a political legitimacy for the KLA terrorists, thegroup’s links to international terrorism and organized crime werewell-documented by the US Congress. The Bilderbergers, however, needed the KLAto spearhead the long desired war against the Serbs. So, the paramilitary army’sdrug-running gang of assassins in Kosovo, supported by al-Qaeda, literallyovernight was elevated to the status of “freedom fighters” (and renamed theKosovo Protection Corps) directly supported by NATO and the UN.What’s more, NATO’s Supreme commander from 1997 to 2000, General Wesley Clark(also a Bilderberg and CFR member), was squarely in the center of the wholemess. The evidence against him, and consequently against the Clintonadministration, compiled in the Congressional transcripts, news reports andintelligence documents became overwhelming. When asked during the USPresidential primaries in 2004 about some of the allegations, Democraticcandidate Clark could only shrug without ever, not once, confronting any ofthem. Clark, a useful Bilderberg dummy, had complied to the letter with hisobligations.According to a 2003 investigative report on www.globalresearch.ca[http://www.globalresearch.ca], Clark had developed “close personal ties withKLA Chief of Staff Commander Brigadier Agim Ceku and KLA Leader Hashim Thaci,”who directly collaborated with NATO during the 1999 Kosovo campaign.27 Accordingto Agence France Presse on October 13, 1999, Thaci also had the distinction ofbeing recognized by the Hague ICTY Tribunal “for alleged war crimes committedagainst ethnic Serbs in Croatia between 1993 and 1995.”28 There is a famousphotograph of the handsome, 34-year-old KLA leader Hashim Thaci kissing USSecretary of State and CFR member Madeleine Albright, with her loyal stoogeGeneral Wesley Clark looking on: a picture that is indeed worth more than 10,000words.According to an article by Alex Todorovic and Charles A. Radin in the BostonGlobe on August 2, 1999, “Terrorists with ties to Osama bin Laden running aroundwith AK-47s and anti-tank weapons is bad enough. Worse, Hashim Thaci’s boysaren’t just killers and kleptomaniacs, but mafiosos who are neck deep in thedrug trade.” During the war, the Washington Times, an organ with close militaryties to the Pentagon, quoted an unnamed US drug enforcement official commentingon the KLA: “They were drug dealers in 1998 and now, because of politics,they’re freedom fighters.”In 1999, Bill Clinton’s administration got a boost from Senator Joe Lieberman,an unofficial representative of the Israeli government in America and soon to beDemocrat Al Gore’s Vice-Presidential running mate in 2000, who statedauthoritatively that “fighting for the KLA is fighting for human rights andAmerican values.” Was he misinformed, or might that have been a “Freudian” slipof the tongue?Shortly after the US presidential election, Ralf Mutschke of Interpol’s CriminalIntelligence Division testified to the US House Judicial Committee on therelationship between the KLA and Osama bin Laden: “The US State Departmentlisted the KLA as a terrorist organization, indicating that it was financing itsoperations with money from the international heroin trade and loans from Islamiccountries and individuals, among them allegedly Osama bin Laden. Another link tobin Laden is the fact that the brother of a leader in an Egyptian Jihadorganization and also a military commander of Osama bin Laden’s, was leading anelite KLA unit during the Kosovo conflict.”29Why would the KLA be attracted to Osama bin Laden and vice versa, in a fightthat apparently pitted Serb nationalists against a US-backed terroristorganization, the KLA? According to military affairs analyst Ben Works, directorof the Strategic Research Institute of the United States (SIRIUS), “The KLA isnot rigidly ideological. The Maoist ideology is an important element, but theselling point for recruits is the group’s militant Albanian nationalism…. Itschief appeal is to the ethnic Albanian Muslim population, and so its nationalismis couched in Islamic terms.”So, you have an international terrorist (Osama bin Laden) trained and funded bythe CIA, an international terrorist organization (the KLA, excuse me, the KosovoProtection Corps) trained and funded by the British, American and German SecretServices and Special Forces, and an American establishment (Clinton, Gore,Clark, Albright, Holbrooke, Lieberman – all Bilderberg and CFR members, whorepresent the interests of the New World Order) fighting to reestablish“democracy” and bring justice to a long suffering and oppressed people.Truth, when unravelled, in many instances is indeed stranger than fiction.REASON FOR WAR – KLA, ALBANIA AND THE DRUG TRADEWhat was largely hidden from public view was the fact that the KLA raised partof their funds from the sale of narcotics. Albania and Kosovo lay at the heartof the “Balkan Route” that links the “Golden Crescent” of Afghanistan andPakistan to the drug markets of Europe. This route is worth an estimated $400billion a year and handles 80 percent of heroin destined for Europe.Frank Ciluffo of the Globalized Organized Crime Program, US House JudiciaryCommittee, December 13, 2000.The KLA, an internationally recognized terrorist group is funded, in largemeasure, by Albanian organized crime – particularly heroin trafficking, and isalso associated with a major drug smuggling ring that runs from Turkey intoEurope via the Balkans.Recall that Michael Levine, a highly decorated former undercover,counter-narcotics agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), and anauthor of the exposés Deep Cover and The Big White Lie, stated that “Interpol,Europol, and nearly every European intelligence and counter-narcotics agency hasfiles open on drug syndicates that lead right to the KLA, and right to Albaniangangs in this country [the US].”What Michael Levine almost certainly did not know is that the KLA-Albanian drugtrade is controlled from “top down,” by the same group that tried to orchestratethe break-up of Canada and started the wars in Afghanistan and in Kosovo. Tounderstand NATO, and consequently Bilderberger, involvement in Kosovo, we mustunderstand the principles of drug trade.It is likely that the actual amount of profit generated annually by the drugtrade is among the world’s most closely guarded secrets. However, a high-rankingexpert on money laundering within the US government agency charged withmonitoring global cash flows once told me, “The round off figure is somewherearound $700 billion in tax free cash flow per year.” In fact, drug money became“an essential part of the world banking and financial system because it providesthe liquid cash necessary to make the ‘minimum monthly payments’ on huge stockand derivative and investment bubbles in the US and Britain,” explained MichaelC. Ruppert, former LAPD narcotics officer, in his best-selling book, Crossingthe Rubicon.THE SPOILS OF EMPIRECorporations trading on Wall Street all have stock values that are based uponannual net revenues. Known as “price to earnings,” this multiplier effect inshareholder equity may be as much as a factor of thirty. Thus, for major firms,say like Chase Manhattan Bank, General Electric or Brown Brothers Harriman tohave an additional $10 million in revenues from the drug trade, the net increasein the firm’s equity could be as much as $300,000,000. These large firms andothers have held ownership positions in America’s three main news networks, withthousands of affiliate stations around the country). Why don’t these networksprovide accurate reporting on the drug trade and the CIA’s involvement therein?Might they be integral to the enterprise?Another thing often overlooked in the lucrative illegal drug trade is thefantastic amount of money corporations can earn from borrowing illegal moneyfrom drug dealers, and drug-dealing nations, at a lower interest rate andlaundering it into astronomical benefits. When 100 billion dollars of uselessillegal money is loaned at five percent to a giant corporation, the money, inturn becomes legal and liquid:The drug trade now has power because it is underwriting the investments of thelargest corporations in the world. It underwrites politicians. It has hooked thegringos on Wall Street whose own children sometimes die from its drugs. WallStreet cannot afford to let the drug barons fall. Congress cannot afford to letthe drug barons fall. Presidents and their campaign finances cannot afford tolet the drug barons fall. Why? Because our top down economy, controlled by oneper cent, cannot take the risk of letting competition (business or political)have the edge of using drug money. And for every million dollars of increasedsales or increased revenues from a buyout, the stock equity of the one percentwho control Wall Street, increases twenty to thirty times.30Thus, the obstacle to a more direct, profitable and efficient route fromAfghanistan and Pakistan through Turkey into Europe “was a cohesiveYugoslavian/Serbian government controlling the Balkans,” continued Ruppert inCrossing the Rubicon. With the destruction of Kosovo and Serbia and theinstallation of the KLA as a regional power, the Clinton administration opened adirect line from Afghanistan to Western Europe.Christian de Brie and Jean de Maillard, in an exposé article titled, “Crime, TheWorld’s Biggest Free Enterprise,” for Le Monde Diplomatique’s April 2000 issue,described a tangible “operating system” of international drug capital flow,estimating the total annual drug trade at $500 billion:By allowing capital to flow unchecked from one end of the world to the other,globalization and abandon of sovereignty have together fostered the explosivegrowth of an outlaw financial market. It is a coherent system closely linked tothe expansion of modern capitalism and based on an association of threepartners: governments, transnational corporations and Mafias. Business isbusiness: financial crime is first and foremost a market, thriving andstructured, ruled by supply-and-demand. Big business complicity and politicallaisser faire is the only way that large-scale organized crime can launder andrecycle the fabulous proceeds of its activities. And the transnationals need thesupport of governments and the neutrality of regulatory authorities in order toconsolidate their positions, increase their profits, withstand and crush thecompetition, pull off the “deal of the century” and finance their illicitoperations. Politicians are directly involved and their ability to intervenedepends on the backing and the funding that keep them in power. This collusionof interests is an essential part of the world economy, the oil that keeps thewheels of capitalism turning.After the 1996 Bilderberg meeting in King City, Toronto, Canada, through theinformation provided to us by our very, very deep sources within the BilderbergGroup, we warned that “to ensure the conflict’s deadly and rapid spread,discussions are already underway concerning the posting of a small and haplessforce of NATO troops on the border between the Yugoslav Federation and Albania,ostensibly to prevent Albanian gun- and drug-running into Kosovo. This willhardly impede the steady flow of weapons coming through that rugged terrain, butit will succeed in protecting the drug shipments being used by the KLA to raisethe necessary funds for a continuous armed struggle and hostilities against theSerbs, necessary conditions for a full-scale war in the Balkans.”We can draw a stunning parallel between today’s Kosovo and another distant landthat occupied the minds of the then-world rulers – the British crown. EveryEnglish child is raised in awe of the immortal name Khyber Pass. Hundreds ofthousands of pages have been written about the British army’s adventures in thisno-man’s land, battling the natives and local tribesmen to protect a meaninglesschunk of land, which no one in his right mind would want to die for … unless,there was a more sinister reason for sending young officers to their death indistant lands.Why was the British Army stationed in the Khyber Pass? For the vile opium trade,the so-called “spoils of Empire,” frivolously talked about in the educated,elegant and well-washed upper-circles of English society, of course. WhatRudyard Kipling neglected to tell you is that the tall tales of valor in theKhyber Pass covered a vast trade in opium. Just as NATO troops were stationed onthe border between the Yugoslav Federation and Albania protecting the drugshipments, so was the British Army stationed in the Khyber Pass to protectcaravans carrying raw opium from being robbed by the tribesmen.Did Clinton, (Bilderberg, CFR member) the US President who had CIA intelligenceat hand, know what was happening? Did Secretary of State Albright (Bilderberg,CFR member) know the KLA boys were drug-running assassins? Was Richard Holbrooke(Bilderberg, CFR member), the “father” of the Dayton Peace Plan, not informed ofthe comings and goings of the drug-running terrorist assassins associated withHashim Thaci? Did NATO’s Secretary General at the time, the “pride of Spain”Javier Solana (Bilderberg member) not know what was going on?Did the British Crown know why soldiers were stationed in one of the mosthostile regions of the world? After all, the costs to the Exchequer wereprohibitive. The lucrative opium trade was practically the only thing of valuein the region at that time. It stretches credulity to think that the highestlevels of Her Majesty’s Government, if not Her Majesty herself, were ignorant ofwhy the Redcoats were being sacrificed. Unfortunately, humankind has not changedone iota, and what drove them to kill then still keeps millions dying in distantlands for the benefit of a small, privileged group of world rulers.ANOTHER REASON FOR WAR – THE MINERAL WEALTH OF KOSOVO’S TREPCAKosovo, loosely translated as “land of blackbirds,” (Kos is a Serbian word for“blackbird”) was often portrayed in the media as an isolated and poormountainous region. It had been a cradle of the Serbian civilization ever sinceKing Stefan Nemanja threw out the Byzantines from Kosovo in 1180 and establishedcontrol over the territories of neighboring Serb tribes. All in all, Serb tribeshave lived in Kosovo for over 1,000 years. Ancient Christian monasteries dottingthe map of Kosovo keep records of their history. In fact, up until 1945, theSerbs constituted a majority of Kosovo’s population; that is before the purgesand repressions under Communist rule decimated Christian Serb inhabitants. In1929, Serbs constituted a bit less than two-thirds of the population, ethnicAlbanians, about one-third, and others just over five percent. In 1961, thepercentage of “others” was the same, but the ethnic Albanians accounted fortwo-thirds and the Serbs for twenty-seven percent.Trepca, situated in northern Kosovo, is a conglomerate of not only its three keyindustries: the Stari Trg9 mine, the Zvecan smelter and the Mitrovicë, anindustrial complex, but also of 41 other mines and factories. Collectively theyare capable of producing up to £3 million worth of vital industrial minerals perday. The New York Times called them the “Kosovo War’s glittering prize.”31 TheStari Trg mine has been yielding precious metals for over two millennia, havingbeen worked initially by the Greeks, then by the Romans, etc.The only article on the Kosovo Trepca Industrial complex to appear in themainstream press was a 1999 piece by Balkan correspondent Chris Hedges. It wassurprisingly frank: “This huge complex of mines, refining, power andtransportation in Kosovo may well be the largest uncontested piece of wealth notyet in the hands of the big capitalists of the US or Europe. The industry,natural resources and transportation of all the former Soviet republics, thesocialist countries of Eastern Europe, and the secessionist republics ofYugoslavia are now being rapidly privatized. No one within the region has thewealth or connections to finance capital to buy controlling shares of these vaststate-owned industries. The major Western corporations are gobbling theseindustries up.”32Could this “uncontested piece of wealth not yet in the hands of the bigcapitalists of the US or Europe” be reason enough to invent a war? As Trepca’sDirector Novak Bjelic emphatically stated, “The war in Kosovo is about themines, nothing else. This is Serbia’s Kuwait – the heart of Kosovo.” Oneobserver compared the conventional mainstream description of Kosovo todescribing Kuwait and the oil-rich Gulf states as “barren deserts.”33To get control of the mines, the Bilderbergers introduced the InternationalCrisis Group (ICG), a high level Brussels-based think tank supported byfinancier and regular Bilderberg attendee, George Soros. The ICG crew consistedof all the regular New World Order globalists dedicated to dismantlingindependent nations for the benefit of the global elite. Zbigniew Brzezinski wasone. So was General Wesley Clark, once the NATO supreme allied commander forEurope, and neoconservatives Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz, as well as formercongressman Stephen Solarz, who was once described as “the Israel lobby’s chieflegislative tactician on Capitol Hill.” Perle, Wolfowitz and Solarz becamefamous for their 1998 letter to President Clinton calling for a “comprehensivepolitical and military strategy for bringing down Saddam and his regime.”Ironically, this was the same regime they had helped put together.The outward reason for the International Crisis Group’s existence was “toprovide policy guidance to governments involved in the NATO-led reshaping of theBalkans.” The hidden reasons were far less humanitarian. On November 26, 1999,the ICG issued a secret paper called “Trepca: Making Sense of the Labyrinth.” Itadvised “the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to take over the Trepcamining complex from the Serbs as quickly as possible” – not for the purposes ofreturning it to the Kosovars, to whom, according to the ICG, the mines belonged,but rather for passing the valuable assets into the waiting hands ofBilderbergers, including Soros.The ICG report also detailed the timing of the theft. Conscious of politicalrepercussions of Trepca’s explosiveness, the ICG urged UNMIK to hurry up withthe game plan for taking over the valuable mining complex “before Serbianelections so that a new government more to the West’s liking cannot be accusedof losing Trepca.” They intended to put the blame at the feet of Miloševic for“losing” this property, vital to Yugoslavia, so he would be denied re-electionby an outraged populace.The under-handedness and greed of these people flew in the face of thedescription on their website, www.crisisgroup.org [http://www.crisisgroup.org]:“The International Crisis Group is now generally recognised as the world’sleading independent, non-partisan, source of analysis and advice to governments,and intergovernmental bodies like the United Nations, European Union and WorldBank, on the prevention and resolution of deadly conflict” [my emphasis]. Withfriends like these, who needs enemies?The Serbs, however, had sensed the trap thus laid for them and had confinedthemselves to short, repressive police actions against the Kosovo Albanianpopulation, none of which had been sufficient in duration, extent or intensityto provide the pretext necessary for the Bilderberger elite to rally WesternEuropean and American public support for a full-fledged military engagementagainst the Serbs. So, their methodical preparation, kidnappings and theBilderbergfriendly Hague Tribunal – funded in part by billionaire financierGeorge Soros, who had a long history of underwriting programs to destabilizecountries whose markets were closed, or partly closed, to Western investment.34Financing and arming of the newly-revealed Kosovo Liberation Army provided theBilderbergers with no dividends at all … and the clock was running out on theirschedule. They needed this war, and they needed it soon.The justification for intervening, or to use ICG’s terminology the “game-plan ofmeasures,” was given as, of all things, Zvecan environmental hazards, that isdangerous atmospheric lead pollution! The ICG advised UNMIK to instruct a“Zvecan environmental assessment team” to report on the status of the equipment,and determine the measures to be taken.”UNMIK was further advised to issue a statement wherein “the mines would remainclosed until repairs could be made to reduce emissions.” Furthermore, accordingto the ICG secret report, “Stari Trg, one of the richest mines in Europe, mustbe potentially profitable again and should be a priority for donors interestedin setting Kosovo on its feet.” In other words, “You donate money, which we willuse to channel into our Bilderberg-controlled corporations that shall reaphandsome profits from the rebuilding process, all supervised by the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund, and we will have taken over the crownjewels of Yugoslavia for a song and a dance.”The last morsel of the Kosovo Trepca Industrial complex still in the hands ofthe Yugoslav government, the Zvecan smelter, was seized by NATO forces on August14, 2000. The ICG instructed UNMIK, headed by France’s former Minister of Healthand the Founder of Doctors without Borders (Médecins sans frontières), BernardKouchner, to “take over management of Trepca itself,” even though the trueownership of the mines was, at the time, a hotly contested issue worth billionof dollars to the eventual winner. Kouchner, “whose mandate was to channelhumanitarian aid under UN auspices, worked closely with NATO officials includingWesley Clark in providing support to Kosovo’s terrorist paramilitary army.35Kouchner is also a member of the Bilderberg Group.A LICENSE TO STEALHow was it possible to plunder virtually all of Kosovo? On June 10, 1999, Dr.Bernard Kouchner, pursuant to authority given to him by the UN Security Councilas Special Representative of the Secretary General, issued the following edict:“UNMIK shall administer movable or immovable property, including monies, bankaccounts, and other property of, or registered in the name of the FederalRepublic of Yugoslavia or the Republic of Serbia or any of its organs, which isin the territory of Kosovo.”36Think about that. And remember that the power to “administrate” implies thepower to redistribute.Financier George Soros invested heavily in Kosovo, spending perhaps $100 millionto help oust President Miloševic. The George Soros Foundation for an OpenSociety opened a branch office in Pristina. It established the Kosovo Foundationfor an Open Society (KFOS) as part of the Soros network of “non-profitfoundations” in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. On November 16,1999, the World Bank issued a press release that confirmed that, together withthe World Bank’s Post Conflict Trust Fund, the KOSF provided “targeted support”for “the development of local governments to allow them to serve theircommunities in a transparent, fair, and accountable manner.”37 But, as MichelChossudovsky observed wryly, “Since most of these local governments are in thehands of the KLA, which has extensive links to organized crime, this program isunlikely to meet its declared objective.”38Neil Clark left little in doubt with the title of his article on Soros’activities for the New Statesman of June 2, 2003: “The billionaire trader hasbecome Eastern Europe’s uncrowned king and the prophet of an ‘open society.’ Butopen to what?”Karen Talbot, in her review of Neil Clark’s article for www.globalresearch.ca[http://www.globalresearch.ca], quoted him in this excerpt: “Soros’ way is touse a few billion dollars, some NGOs and a ‘nod and wink from the US Statedepartment’ to bring down foreign governments that are ‘bad for business’ toseize a nation’s assets, and even get thanked for your benevolence.”39The Russian paper Nezavisimaya Gazeta reported in its issue for August 9, 2005,that former Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze had personally warned UzbekPresident Islam Karimov about spying activities of George Soros’s Open SocietyInstitute in Uzbekistan, Georgia, Ukraine, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Abkhazia,Adjaria, South Ossetia, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan. Shevardnadze had beenousted in a coup by a neocon ally of the Bush administration in November 1993.Soros’ well-known animus for US President George W. Bush may seem puzzling giventheir similar New-World-Order objectives. Neil Clark speculated in the NewStatesman that Soros was angry, “not at Bush’s aims – of expanding Pax Americanaand making the world safe for global capitalists like himself – but with thecrass and blundering way Bush is going about it. By making US ambitions soclear, the Bush gang has committed the cardinal sin of giving the game away. Foryears, Soros and his NGOs have gone about their work extending the boundaries ofthe ‘free world’ so skillfully that hardly anyone noticed. Now a Texan redneckand a gang of overzealous neocons have blown it.”Meanwhile, an incarcerated Slobodan Miloševic had resigned the Yugoslavpresidency shortly after the disputed election of September 2000. He wasarrested on March 31, 2001 by Yugoslav federal authorities on a variety ofcharges relating to corruption and abuse of power. When their investigationfailed to reveal hard evidence, the Serbian prime minister shipped him to TheHague to stand trial for war crimes, where he languished for years. “Yet theorganizations that are normally so vociferous in their indignation about humanrights violations have been remarkably silent,” observed George Szamuely for theNew York Press. “Fraudulent NGOs that are really agencies of Westerngovernments, like the George Soros-financed Human Rights Watch, have beenpositively gleeful at the treatment meted out to Slobodan Miloševic. AmnestyInternational anguishes about the plight of al-Qaeda prisoners at Guantanamo,yet stays silent about this abuse of a political prisoner.”40MILOŠEVIC’S TIMELY DEATHSlobodan Miloševic died on the same day that his arch-enemy, Agim Ceku, formercommander of the KLA was elected Prime Minister of Kosovo. Miloševic deathcertainly came as a relief to the Hague Tribunal who, for the preceding fouryears, had been trying unsuccessfully to convict a man who stood his groundbefore the entire world.Miloševic was found dead in his prison cell on March 11, 2006, apparently thevictim of a heart attack, less than three days after writing a letter addressedto the Russian Foreign Ministry, asking them to intercede to win him permissionfrom his jailers, the Balkan War Crimes Tribunal, to go to Russia for medicalcare. Miloševic’s death was the sixth such incident of an accused Serb incustody of the Hague Tribunal.In a press conference on March 13, 2006, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrovstated that, in his letter, Miloševic expressed concern that some of thetreatment methods applied to him by doctors of the International Tribunal forthe Former Yugoslavia were having a disastrous effect on his health.In January 2006, Tribunal officials had refused Miloševic’s request to go toRussia for treatment, even though the Russian government offered completeguarantees that the former Serb leader would duly return to The Hague aftercompleting his treatment.Lev Bokeriya, head of the Bakulev Cardiovascular Surgery Center, told Russia’sItar-Tass news agency, “Miloševic belonged to the category of patients with alight coronary condition. He could have been easily cured. If Miloševic had beentaken to any specialized Russian hospital, he would have been subjected tocoronographic examination, two stents would have been made, and he would havelived for many years to come.” Dr. Bokeriya, who headed the delegation of fourRussian physicians to the Hague autopsy, stated on record that the evident causeof death was “the narrowing of the main blood vessel, which brought about aheart attack.”Clearly, Miloševic’s death remains suspicious. According to my sources withinthe Belarusian KGB working for Stepan Sukhorenko, whose account of the eventshas been categorically confirmed by sources in the Russian Foreign Ministry andby senior US counterintelligence operatives overseeing the Miloševic trial,Miloševic’s “timely” death was an outright assassination. The former Serb leaderwas becoming a major embarrassment to the US-led effort to bring former warcriminals to trial, and the call had gone out to get rid of him.Had Miloševic been in Russia and out of reach of an assassin’s bullet, or inthis case, venom, he may have become a rallying point for a new Serbia, whosecitizens are more than disenchanted with the friendly embrace of theBilderberg-led alliance. Russia’s traditional role as “Protector of the Slavs”may have been reasserted, with who knows what repercussions.The official, publicly pronounced autopsy was a compete whitewash. A KGBofficer, who shall remain anonymous and who at one time worked with AlexanderShelepin of the KGB’s International Department, made the following comment to anacquaintance of mine shortly after the official announcement became publicknowledge: “Disinformation is not just lying. It is expected to serve as asubtle means of inducing another government to do what one wants it to do, or tofrighten or bluff a foreign government into inaction or making concessions.However, two can play this game.”There seems to be no lack of potential suspects. The KGB, along with theBulgarian and Romanian Secret Service, are reckoned to be among the most skilledpoisoners in the world. However, they are not alone. The CIA and the BritishChemical, Microbiological and Bacteriological Research Division at Porton Downare constantly engaged in refining killer devices. Today, there are apparentlymore than 400 substances that can kill without leaving a trace. If you know theautopsy will be rigged, you may even be able to leave a trace.One such useful medication, and the one that is suspected to have killedMiloševic, is good old-fashioned digitalis. This drug will show up only if aproper autopsy is conducted. Digitalis can only be taken in carefully measureddoses. An overdose will bring on a heart attack, and it is impossible todistinguish this death from a heart attack due to natural causes. Even peoplewho have never experienced a heart condition will die immediately if digitalisis “improperly” administered.Whatever the truth may be, there can be no doubt that the death of SlobodanMiloševic has left the former Yugoslavia even riper for plunder.Notes1.

An initial investigation about the CIA/Contras/drugs was written by GaryWebb for the San Jose Mercury News. Several years later, he committed suicidedue to relentless pressure from the CIA. His investigation ignited a firestormof controversy and made one stunning allegation: The Contras’ drug-smugglingoperation bore major responsibility for a public-health epidemic in America.“The cocaine that flooded in helped spark a crack explosion in urban America …”The report said two Nicaraguans, Danilo Blandon and Norwin Meneses, sold tons ofcocaine to Los Angeles drug dealer, Ricky Ross. The articles said Blandon andMeneses funneled millions of dollars in profits to CIA-backed rebels fightingthe leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and Washington Post ran lengthy pieceshellbent on proving Gary Webb wrong, rather than attempting to follow up on hisstories. “In doing so, the mainstream press shirked its larger duty; thus itbears the larger burden,” reported Eric Umansky for Mother Jones magazine onAugust 25, 1998. We can draw a parallel to another Bilderberg unit, Grupo Prisaof Spain, whose Juan Luis Cebrian is a full-time member of the Bilderbergerinner circle and whose flagship periodical, El País, knowingly hid the date ofthe Iraq invasion from 40 million Spaniards for one year before it took place.13.

As a historical reference, the Serbs were the victims of history’s greatestacts of ethnic cleansing, such as the 200,000 or so Serbs who were ethnicallycleansed from the Krajina region of Croatia in the US-backed “Operation Storm”in 1995, or the 100,000 Serbs who were ethnically cleansed from Kosovo by theKLA at the end of the NATO bombing.

Roger Boyes and Eske Wright writing for theTimes of London, in an article entitled “Drugs Money Linked to the KosovoRebels” published on March 24, 1999, stated that “Albania – which plays a keyrole in channeling money to the Kosovans – is at the hub of Europe’s drugtrade.” In 2004, somewhere between 400 and 500 metric tons of heroin wereconsumed world-wide. According to the US DEA and Department of JusticeIntelligence reports, about 80% of heroin entering Europe does so throughKosovo. Another intelligence report, which was prepared by Germany’s FederalCriminal Agency, concluded, “Ethnic Albanians are now the most prominent groupin the distribution of heroin in Western consumer countries.”It took Jane’s Intelligence Review, the undisputed premier intelligence magazinein the world, almost three additional years (In a January 3, 1999 editorialtitled, “Unhealthy Climate in Kosovo as Guerrillas Gear Up for a SummerConfrontation”) to come to the same conclusion that we first reported after the1996 Bilderberg meeting: “Western intelligence agencies believe the UCK [theacronym for the KLA in Albanian] has been re-arming with the aid of money fromdrug-smuggling through Albania, along with ‘donations’ from the Albaniandiaspora in Western Europe and North America…. Albania has become the crimecapital of Europe. The most powerful groups in the country are organizedcriminals who use Albania to grow, process, and store a large percentage of theillegal drugs destined for Western Europe…. Albania’s criminal gangs areactively supporting the war in Kosovo. Many of them have family links toAlbanian groups in Kosovo and support them with arms and other supplies, eitherout of family solidarity or solely for profit. These links mean the UCK fightershave a secure base area and reasonably good lines of communication to theoutside world. Serb troops have tried to seal the border but with littlesuccess.”1If the KLA were “allowed” to sell drugs and to profit from the sales, it isreasonable to infer that the entire operation was approved from the top down;that is, by the Bilderbergers themselves (through the usual set ofintermediaries such as the US Government, the British, German and the US secretservice agencies, the UN bureaucracy, pertinent NGOs, European Commissions andNATO, all of which they control). Going back at least to the 1950s and thesurrogate wars between East and West in Southeast Asia, involvement ofgovernment “spooks” in the drug trade has become notorious, though of courseadamantly denied by the governments themselves.In 1997 Michael Ruppert submitted a lengthy written statement with exhibits tothe Select Intelligence Committees of both houses of Congress. It was not placedin the Congressional record, and he was not allowed to testify. It began asfollows:Mr. Chairman:On November 15, 1996, I stood at a town hall meeting at Locke High School in LosAngeles and said to Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch, “I am a formerLos Angeles Police narcotics detective. I worked South Central Los Angeles and Ican tell you, Director Deutch, emphatically and without equivocation, that theAgency has dealt drugs in this country for a long time.” I then referredDirector Deutch to three specific Agency operations known as Amadeus, Pegasusand Watchtower.Most Americans have been lead to believe that the purpose of these hearings isto ascertain whether or not there is any evidence that the Central IntelligenceAgency dealt drugs during the Iran-Contra era. If these hearings were aboutevidence, then the most patriotic duty I could perform would be to quote JackBlum who served as chief investigator for the Kerry Subcommittee on narcoticsand terrorism ten years ago. He testified before this committee last year andsaid, “We don’t have to investigate. We already know.” We could save a lot oftaxpayer money by just rereading the records of the Kerry hearings. There ismore evidence in there than any court in the world would ever need to hand downindictments.At best, I could just quote you one entry from Oliver North’s diary dated July5, 1985, which said that $14 million to buy weapons for the Contras, “came fromdrugs.” I wouldn’t need to mention the two hundred and fifty other such entriesin his diary which refer to narcotics. Or I could quote Dennis Dayle, a seniorDEA supervisory agent, who said, “In my thirty year history in DEA, the majortargets of my investigations almost invariably turned out to be working for theCIA.”But these hearings are not about evidence. They are about corruption andcover-up. The CIA did not just deal drugs during the Iran-Contra era; it hasdone so for the full fifty years of its history. Today I will give you evidencewhich will show that the CIA, and many figures who became known duringIran-Contra such as Richard Secord, Ted Shackley, Tom Clines, Felix Rodriguezand George Herbert Walker Bush, who was DCI [Director of Central Intelligence]when I first became exposed to Agency drug dealing, have been selling drugs toAmericans since the Vietnam era. I have been very careful to make sure that whatI tell you today is admissible evidence in criminal proceedings.The use of the drug trade to secure economic advantage goes back to the BritishEast India Company and its first smuggling of opium from India into China in thelate 1600s. It did that for 300 years. Why fiddle with something that broughtuntold billions to the ruling elites? Drugs also became the principal source ofincome for the wealthiest banking families associated with the Bilderberg Group,which in a variety of ways is a direct descendant of the East India Companies,both Dutch and British.By the 20th century, the drug trade was illegal. Now, before the money generatedcould be used for legitimate business, it needed to be hidden, and then to belaundered. Seven hundred billion dollars a year is too much money to hide in asock. A lot of experience and expertise is needed to move such funds stealthily.Funds transferred electronically, often in confusing arrays, move so quicklythat they become traceable only by those controlling the computers and software.According to the International Monetary Fund’s 2001 report, “The production andlaundering of drug money is central because it establishes channels for the flowof other criminal profits.” The British Foreign Office reported that “moneylaundering processes $1.5 trillion or 2-5% of global GDP,” a figure thatexceeded the gross domestic products of all but the world’s five largesteconomies.A report of the US Senate Republican Policy Committee from March 1999 put thewar in context: “The reported link between drug activities and arms purchasesfor anti-Serb Albanian forces in Kosovo predates the formation of the KLA, andindeed, may be seen as a key resource that allowed the KLA to establish itselfas a force in the first place.”2An article published in the San Francisco Chronicle in 1994 described a broadercontext: “Narcotics smuggling has become a prime source of financing for civilwars already under way – or rapidly brewing – in southern Europe and the easternMediterranean. The report, by the Paris-based Observatoire Geopolitique desDrogues, or Geopolitical Observatory of Drugs, identifies belligerents in theformer Yugoslav republics and Turkey as key players in the region’s acceleratingdrugs-for-arms traffic. Albanian nationalists in ethnically tense Macedonia andthe Serbian province of Kosovo have built a vast heroin network, leading fromthe opium fields of Pakistan to black-market arms dealers in Switzerland, whichtransports up to $2 billion worth of the drugs annually into the heart ofEurope, the report says. More than 500 Kosovo or Macedonian Albanians are inprison in Switzerland for drug- or arms-trafficking offences, and more than1,000 others are under indictment. The arms are reportedly stockpiled in Kosovofor eventual use against the Serbian government in Belgrade, which imposed aviolent crackdown on Albanian autonomy advocates in the province five yearsago.”3MAKING SMACKOpium is grown in several different regions of the world: South America; theGolden Triangle of Laos, Burma, and Thailand; and Afghanistan, Pakistan, andcentral Asia in an area called the Golden Crescent. The vast majority of opiumpoppies are grown in a narrow, 4,500-mile stretch of mountains extending acrosssouthern Asia from Turkey through Pakistan and Laos. The opium poppy prefers awarm, dry climate at altitudes above 4,000 feet, and is grown by Thai andBurmese hill tribesmen. When it is about to reach maturity, the plant produces aflower. A week or so later the petals fall off, leaving a pod from which the rawopium gum is harvested by slicing with a razor or thin-bladed knife. The rawopium resin leaks through the cut and is rolled into balls, set out to dry forseveral days, then wrapped in a banana leaf or plastic. “The tribesmen are paidin i kilo gold bars, known as 4/10ths, which are minted by Credit Suisse. Thesesmall bars are used only to pay the tribesman, the normal-weight gold bars aretraded on the Hong Kong market by the big buyers of raw opium or partlyprocessed heroin. The same methods are used to pay hill tribesman in India, theBaluchis, who have been in this business since the days of the Moguls. The ‘DopeSeason,’ as it is called, sees a flood of gold traded on the Hong Kong market.”4Raw opium is often transported through Turkey and the Levant to Corsica, forfurther processing in Europe, though the Mideast areas are increasinglythemselves home to lucrative heroin refineries. The Mediterranean coastline fromMarseilles to Monte Carlo abounds in them, and many have speculated that theruling Grimaldi family of Monaco have been involved.Monaco, where gold-trade tycoon Edmond Safra suffered his strange demise, is theworld’s most important opium-processing center. Some believe the only way thiscould be accomplished is if the Grimaldi family is actively supporting andprotecting it. They theorize Princess Grace was murdered because Prince Rainierwas skimming off the top. He refused to heed several warnings, believing himselfto be one of the untouchables. He, or rather she, was promptly dealt with by theNew World Order. To this day, the Rover car that Princess Grace drove the nightof the accident has remained in the custody of French police.According to Anthony M. DeStefano’s front-page article in the Wall StreetJournal for September 9, 1985, Albanian Mafiosi residing in the United States,were responsible for moving “25% to 40% of the US heroin supply,” in thepipeline reaching back through Belgrade to Istanbul.Once opium gum is transported to a refinery, it is converted into morphine, andthen heroin, by chemical processes. The main chemical used is acetic anhydride,along with sodium carbonate, activated charcoal, chloroform, ethyl alcohol,ether and acetone.Tough-talking public campaigns launched by central governments in Europe andNorth America that promise “to take the fight to the drug pushers” are purenonsense. If governments really wanted to eradicate the vile drug trade, theycould make laws that would oblige manufacturers of acetic anhydride, the mostessential chemical in the manufacture of heroin, to keep meticulous recordsshowing who buys the chemical, for what purpose and where it is going. But suchunilateral action on the part of any maverick government would greatly displeasethe oligarchic families of Europe and the United States Establishment because,as I have indicated, these people are turning hundreds of billions of dollarseach year from the drug trade.Needless to say, the leader who truly dared to really “take the fight to thedrug pusher” would become a target for immediate assassination. Why have thenames of the “real culprits,” the noble families of Britain and America’s toppeople, remained hidden for so long? Because banks have profited from illegaltrading through myriad middle men and ghost companies, leaving their criminalparticipation well hidden from public scrutiny.So, the ‘Albanian issue” – money laundering, drugs, gun running, terrorism –centered in Kosovo was a powder keg waiting to explode. And the Bilderbergerswere willing to let that the whole region explode with it.Once again, the context may be broadened: “Taking sides in this conflict withthe Kosovars, and the KLA, and therefore Albania, pleased Turkey, Iran, theMuslim world, and even gave Turkey a chance to fight alongside the Europeans,while side-lining their arch-rival Greece somewhat. That pulls Turkey intoEurope, rather than leaving it drifting eastward, which favors Western oilinterests in the Caucuses and Central Asia, also by offsetting Russia. Thisseems to be the crucial point as far as Kosovo is concerned, as well as thelonger term geostrategic intent.”5Now, you can be sure of several things. One, the Bilderbergers are notphysically responsible for moving drugs and laundering drug profits. This taskis charged to the CIA.6 CIA actions usually are accompanied by the explosion ofheroin in the region. (Iraq, never known to have had a drug problem, today isone of the hotbeds for Afghan heroin, according to the International NarcoticsControl Board, an influential drug agency, quoted by the BBC News on May 12,2005.) Furthermore, the cash flow and the profits from the smuggling will now bedirected through US banks and stocks back into Wall Street coffers. “That iswhat the CIA does,” was the succinct conclusion of former narcotics cop MichaelC. Ruppert in an article titled “The Lies about Taliban Heroin.”7The final objective of diverting huge quantities of cash is twofold: to weakenRussia and to de-stabilize the entire region from the Balkans, passing throughTurkey, Eastern Europe and Russia. Destabilization in the region may wellBalkanize Russia. Additionally, the increasing US military andBilderberger-controlled economic presence will consolidate their New WorldOrder’s control over the last remaining oil and gas reserves in the region. Thiswill result in a further drain on Russian influence in the region and greatlyincrease global instability. Global instability offers the Bilderbergers agolden opportunity to sell guns and butter to both sides.DOPE, INC.Do the drug barons in outlaw states benefit from the nefarious business ofnarcotics? The world’s largest and most powerful corporations and some of ourleading citizens have been benefitting from the business long before the PabloEscobars and the Manuel Noriegas came along. What do international terrorism,the world’s financial markets, empire building and capitalism have in common?Their utter dependence on drug profits for their very existence.The war on drugs is a sham. It has always been a sham and for as long as thereis money to be made, it will continue being a sham, while our political classespay lip service to the dangers of substance abuse with easy to remember sloganssuch as “just say no.” There are historical reasons for this.In his well-researched book, Opium, Empire and the Global Political Economy,Professor Carl Trockl argues that an organized drug trade can historically belinked with the development of capitalism. One of the key derivatives of drugtrade, according to the author, was the creation of a rudimentary form ofmonopoly. “The existence of monopoly resulted in the concentration of vast poolsof wealth in the hands of a relatively small group of people. Wealth led toaccumulation of power. The accumulation of wealth and power created by asuccession of historic drug trades have been among the primary foundations ofglobal capitalism and a modern nation-state itself.”8As a result of this process, Trocki postulates, a number of fundamentaltransformations in human life have taken place, dramatically altering bothsocial and economic terrain in the process. “Two major effects are the creationof mass markets and the generation of unprecedented cash flow. Over time, drugscame to be an essential element in the finances of every criminal structure fromthe sixteenth century European empires up until the present. All depended anddepend on enormous profits that come from monopolizing the world’s mostlucrative business.”9In fact, the entire rise of the West, from 1500 to 1900, depended on a series ofdrug trades. In the process, Europeans became the most prominent producers andpurveyors. Opium was the first addictive drug imposed by force on a population.It was sold in order to make a profit. Those profits went first to theinstitutions which promoted and protected the trade. “Foremost among them werethe British and Dutch East Indian Companies, its successor the British colonialgovernment of India, and the community of Dutch and later British merchants wholaid the economic foundation of the imperial economy. Opium trade was not simplyan aberration of the British Empire. It was a crucial component of it. TheBritish Empire, the opium trade and the rise of capitalism all occurredtogether.”10 When the opium trade was ended early in the twentieth century, theBritish Empire began to collapse.Opium was crucial to the expansion of the British Empire during the lateeighteenth and early nineteenth century, and without it, there may not have beenan empire at all. “Profits from drugs paid the bills and provided a regularsource of high-quality revenue that made it possible for the Indian empire tocontinue. In addition to being a major source of revenue, it was also thelargest single item of export for the first seventy years of the nineteenthcentury.”11 The drug business also created a concentration of capitalists and aglobal capitalist structure, without which none of what followed would have beenpossible. These developments took place first in London, and later in Boston andNew York.The great merchant houses, the banks and the insurance companies that had theirroots in the Asian trade, all had their start in opium. Mountains of money werecreated by the opium trade, as well as a mass market, and fed the accumulatinginstitutions in banking, insurance and transportation.In the end, capitalism has always been intimately tied to drug economies becauseit needed ready and off-the-books cash to finance exploitation and “defense,”and all under the banner of “free trade.” “The coalescence of banking, shippingand insurance around the opium trade was one of the most remarkable features ofthe era. Not only did they service the opium traffic, but they became thefoundation of a commercial infrastructure that ultimately supported a wide rangeof trade.”12Over time, drugs became a commodity that created a need for other commodities.From the fifteenth century until well into the twentieth, land, labor, fiscalrelations, and even the state itself were underwriten by the opium trade. Thiswas built on a commodity that previously for millennia had been almostexclusively medicinal, and which the British knew was a poison and addictive.Perhaps today when we refer to “narco-states” such as Colombia and Afghanistan,we should remember that the first true “narco-state” was run and operated fromLondon.How does it all fit into the bigger picture?Let’s start by saying that drug money is an inherent part of the American andworld economy. In following global cash flows, it’s staggering to find out theamount of profit generated annually by the drug trade is somewhere around $700billion. This figure includes heroin, opium, morphine, marijuana, cocaine, crackcocaine and hallucinogens. As noted, drug money is now “an essential part of theworld banking and financial system because it provides the liquid cash necessaryto make the ‘minimum monthly payments’ on huge stock and derivative andinvestment bubbles in the US and Britain.”13How can $700 billion in illegal profits crisscrossing international borders getthrough the international banking system and past the eyes and ears of lawenforcement authorities? The answer takes us behind the corporate board roomsand precious metal exchanges to the inner sanctum of some of the world’swealthiest people: eight to ten generations of men who built their empiresaround the opium trade. This may seem more like fiction than fact. But fact itis. Historical fact, etched in stone for posterity, recorded in the availabledocuments at the National Library of Singapore, the National Archives of India,the University of London, the British Library, the Jardine Matheson Archives atthe University of Cambridge Library, and the British East Indian CompanyArchives, as well as government records in Hong Kong and Macao.It began in the seventeenth century and involved an entire succession of empirebuilders. This included Robert Clive and Warren Hastings in the eighteenthcentury, and Alexander Matheson, David Sasoon, the Perkins and the Codmans, theRussells and the Appletons, the Boylestons and the Cunninghams amongst aplethora of others in the nineteenth. Opium represented money, fantastic gobs ofmoney, money beyond anyone’s wildest dreams. Nobody needed to remind the empirebuilders that money made the world go around. They were empire builders in thecorridors of power, and filthy drug runners in the annals of history.What may be a surprise is how shamelessly and publicly the drug runnersoperated. “Opium trading for the British was not a sordid backstreet business,but an honored instrument of state policy, the mainstay of the Exchequer, andthe subject of praise from Britain’s leading supporters of ‘free trade,’ AdamSmith, Thomas Malthus, James and John Stuart Mill. The poisoning of the world,did not lead to prison but to peerages and government appointments to importantpositions.”14 It still does, to this day.We are talking about the most highly organized, top-down political machinery inthe world, enjoying the logistical support of a $700-billion-per-annuminternational cartel, and the protection of every political entity Britain andthe US have created through these vast invisible earnings. This protectionapplies not merely to growing and distribution, but to providing political,intelligence, and ideological support as well. Like international terrorism,wherever it is retreating, it just can’t quite be stamped out: indicating thatsome of the biggest names in royal circles and the internationaloligarchy/plutocracy are the puppeteers, even if managed through cut outs andintermediaries concealing the identities of those pulling the strings.Nor should we forget the gigantic supporting facilities of the world’s officialcredit markets, the world’s gold and diamond trade, and “hands-on” management ofthe retail distribution, or organized crime of the operation. They are allderivatives of Drugs Incorporated. One purpose of the drug trade is to createunseen liquid capital, and to make it available to those wishing to gain anunfair advantage in the marketplace. This cash must go through nominallylegitimate channels, in such mind-boggling volumes that the nominally legitimatechannels, bank and other financial institutions cannot possibly be unaware ofthe origin of the moneys. The fact that most of this money flow is seasonal,completed during the two months following the March poppy harvest, can only addto our stupor. Banks pleading ignorance – “We didn’t know” – is simply not anoption.If 700 billion dollars a year in illegal drug money is moved and launderedthrough the American and world economy, that money, again, benefits financialmarkets and especially Wall Street. That’s the reason for maintaining theillegal drug trade.From The Wilderness Contributing Editor Catherine Austin Fitts, George H.W.Bush’s Assistant Secretary of Housing, and a former managing director at DillonRead with ample experience as a Wall Street investment banker, has been acrusader in the effort to expose the underbelly. She and her new investment firmwere quickly targeted for investigation by both the Department of Justice andHUD. This experience is described in some detail in her 13-part Internet article“Narco-Dollars For Beginners: How The Money Works In The Illicit Drug Trade.”The following excerpts are from that highly recommended piece, which looks atthe problem from the bottom up as well as the top down:Every day there are two or three teenagers on the corner dealing drugs acrossfrom our home in Philadelphia. We figured that if they had a 50% deal with asupplier, did $300 a day of sales each, and worked 250 days a year that theirsupplier could run his net profits of approximately $100,000 through a localfast food restaurant that was owned by a publicly traded company.Assuming that company has a stock market value that is a multiple of 20-30 timesits profits, a handful of illiterate teenagers could generate approximately $2-3million in stock market value for a major corporation, not to mention a niceflow of deposits and business for the Philadelphia banks and insurancecompanies….So if I have a company that has a $100,000 of income and a stock trading at 20times earnings, if I can find a way to run $100,000 of narcotics sales by a fewteenagers in West Philadelphia through my financial statements, I can get mystock market value to go up from $2 million to $4 million. I can double my“pop.” That is a quick $2 million profit from putting a few teenagers to work …The total stock market value generated in the Philadelphia area with $20-40billion in narco retail sales would be about $80-160 billion. If you add all thethings you could do with debt or and other ways to increase the multiples, andyou could get that even higher, say $100-250 billion….The problems this presents to people trying to run an honest business arenumerous. The problems it creates for our work ethic and culture are numeroustoo. It increasingly puts the low performance people in charge, and everyonestarts to behave like and follow them….John Gotti, Jr, not a reliable source, when asked by a reporter whether or notthe New York Gotti family was dealing in narcotics, said, “No, who can competewith the government?”The CIA, also not a reliable source, backs up Mr. Gotti’s position. According tothe CIA’s own Inspector General, the government has been facilitating drugtrafficking. Indeed, according to the CIA and DOJ (Dept. of Justice), the CIAand DOJ created a memorandum of understanding that permitted the CIA to help itsallies and assets to traffic in drugs and not have to report it.What does this mean in the world of high finance? If firms like Hong Kong andShanghai Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, Royal Bank of Scotland, Chase ManhattanBank, Citibank, or General Electric were to have an additional $40 million inearnings from the drug trade, with a price-to-earnings multiplier of 20, the netincrease in their company’s equity would be $800 million.If you still believe that there can not really be major, hands-on, institutionalinvolvement in the drug trade, you will be surprised to hear that in late June1999, numerous news services, including the Associated Press, reported thatRichard A. Grasso, then Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, flew down toColombia for a jungle encounter with a spokesperson for Raul Reyes of theRevolutionary Armed Forces of Columbia (FARC). FARC is Colombia’s majornarco-terrorist outfit, with which the United States government is unofficiallyat war.The purpose of the trip was “to bring a message of cooperation from US financialservices” and to discuss foreign investment and the future role of US businessesin Colombia. What does Colombia have that the United States could possibly want?Money – drug money: over a trillion dollars in equity that has been building upin Colombia for over thirty years now. These are practically limitless resourcesthat make Wall Street salivate at the thought of channeling them through itsfinancial markets.Of course it’s not always easy. If an individual American goes to a bank anddeposits $10,000 or more in cash, the bank is obligated by law to fill out acurrency transaction report. Large corporations, however, can cash a check for100 million dollars from any drug lord with no disclosure requirementwhatsoever. However, before they can channel this money into actual year-endresults, something needs to be done to legitimize it.Unlike one hundred and fifty years ago, today, profits from the lucrative drugtrade are illegal. That’s another thing often overlooked by people trying tounderstand how the entire nefarious business of drugs works. Before that moneycan be used legally, it needs to hide, then be laundered. You can’t hide sevenhundred billion dollars in a mattress. “The money moves so quickly that, unlessone were in control of the computer systems that handle it, or the software thatmanages it, it would be impossible to trace.”15 Ignorance, therefore, especiallywhen the laundering transactions are gigantic ones, is not a tenable position.Additionally, corporations can earn a fantastic amount of money from borrowingillegal money from drug dealers and drug dealing nations at a lower interestrate and laundering it into astronomical benefits. When 100 billion dollars ofuseless illegal money is loaned at five percent to a giant corporation, themoney, in turn becomes legal and liquid.Le Monde Diplomatique, the premier information source for internationaldiplomats, in an in-depth investigative report, found US intelligence services,banks, and other multinational corporations at the top of a huge global networkof organized crime and money laundering. It cited “cartels, insider dealing andspeculation, fraudulent balance sheets, embezzlement of public funds, spying,blackmail, and betrayal, among a host of other seamy practices. But these cannotsucceed without governments willing to keep restrictive regulations to aminimum, to abolish or override such rules as do exist, to paralyse inquiries …and to reduce or grant amnesty from any penalties.”17The Central Intelligence Agency is very much plugged into this system. The CIAhas had its name linked to the drug trade for most of the Company’s sixty-plusyears of existence. Most key players in the Agency’s history have held a specialrelationship with America’s financial system.Clark Clifford: Wall Street lawyer and banker. Former secretary of defense forLyndon B.

One classified activity related to CIA drug dealingoperations was codenamed Amadeus, a CIA umbrella, governing laundering of drugmoney through a host of banks worldwide. Admitted five months before dying froman inoperable brain tumour that the CIA has been involved in the drug trade.Left a signed notarized affidavit attesting to this fact with Richard Nixonsigning on as a witness.18From Vietnam to Cambodia, from Laos to Pakistan and Afghanistan, from Iran tothe Contras and beyond, the Agency has been the progressive left’s favoritewhipping boy. However, it isn’t only the CIA who are up to their eyeballs indrugs. In the aforementioned article, Le Monde Diplomatique explicitly statedthat “the secret services of the world’s most powerful state apparatus [i.e.,the US] … have moved into economic warfare,” becoming “international financialcrime’s number-one partner.”19 The same charge can be levelled at the BritishForeign Intelligence (MI6), the Israeli Mossad, French DGSE, Russian FSB, not tomention intelligence agencies from Morocco, Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador,Venezuela, Panama, Dominican Republic, the Philippines and beyond.Popular fairy tales aside, the Vietnam War was about drugs. The French werepushed out, and the ensuing vacuum was immediately filled by the Agency, whichtook over the drug trade, its processing and distribution. From this starkperspective, little room is left to idealists’ vision of the Vietnam War as aconflict pitting good versus evil, us versus them, Old Glory versus the Hammerand Sickle, Onward Christian Soldiers versus Godless Commies. No, it wassomething else. In the symbiotic relationship between economic and militarypower, money feeds the military, and military force maintains resources andmarkets. War and drugs: a match made in heaven.Christian de Brie and Jean de Maillard, in another brilliant article for LeMonde Diplomatique’s April 2000 issue titled, “Crime, The World’s Biggest FreeEnterprise,” describe a tangible “operating system” of international drugcapital flow: “By allowing capital to flow unchecked from one end of the worldto the other, globalization and abandon of sovereignty have together fosteredthe explosive growth of an outlaw financial market. It is a coherent systemclosely linked to the expansion of modern capitalism and based on an associationof three partners: governments, transnational corporations and Mafias. Businessis business: financial crime is first and foremost a market, thriving andstructured, ruled by supply and demand. Big business complicity and politicallaisser faire is the only way that largescale organized crime can launder andrecycle the fabulous proceeds of its activities. And the transnationals need thesupport of governments and the neutrality of regulatory authorities in order toconsolidate their positions, increase their profits, withstand and crush thecompetition, pull off the ‘deal of the century’ and finance their illicitoperations. Politicians are directly involved and their ability to intervenedepends on the backing and the funding that keep them in power. This collusionof interests is an essential part of the world economy, the oil that keeps thewheels of capitalism turning.”In other words, drugs are big business, run, controlled and protected by verypowerful people who work alongside leading banking institutions on both sides ofthe Atlantic, members of various governments and principal corporations whosestock is traded on the world’s leading stock exchanges. One such institution,apparently, is the Hong Kong and Shanghai Corporation (BHSH). Out of the secondOpium War (1858-60), the British merchant banks and trading companiesestablished BHSH, “which to this day serves as the central clearinghouse for allFar Eastern financial transactions relating to the black market in opium and itsheroin derivatives.”20Another suspect is Canada’s Bank of Nova Scotia, now headquartered in Toronto.On the one hand, it serves as a major gold dealer and leader of the Toronto goldmarket, and on the other, it serves as banker for giant Canadian miningcompanies operating in the third world. According to knowledgeable USintelligence sources, the Bank of Nova Scotia may be a major dirty moneyoperator in the Caribbean, running flight-capital against currency restrictions,a serious violation of local currency laws.How do banks with their great air of respectability fit into the drug trade withall of its attendant filth? One way is by financing legitimate purchases ofcompanies registered and licensed to do business as importers of chemicals. TheHong Kong and Shanghai Bank is right in the middle of such trade through acompany called Tejapaibul, which banks with BHSH. What does this company do? Itimports into Hong Kong most of the chemicals needed to process raw opium intoheroin by the diacetylation of morphine with acetic anhydride, the irreplaceablechemical agent in heroin processing. Acetic anhydride is also used in theconversion of cellulose into acetate, a component of photographic film, and inthe production of aspirin. It should be surprising, then, that the largestmarkets for diverted acetic anhydride continue to be in Afghanistan. I know whatyou are thinking. Afghanis may simply be more susceptible to the common coldthan anyone else on the planet.Tough-talking public campaigns cynically launched with all the bells andwhistles during national elections by governments in Europe and the UnitedStates promising “to take the fight to the drug lords” are pure nonsense. Asnoted, if governments, the European Parliament or the United States Congress forexample, were serious about eradicating the vile drug trade, they would makelaws requiring the meticulous tracking of acetic anhydride and other essentialchemicals. Such unilateral and decisive action however, would greatly displeasethe empire builders.OUR ISLAMIC ALLYWe would be wise to understand Turkey’s historically vital importance toAmerica’s and the West’s geopolitical interests. In fact, Turkey’s relationshipto opium and to the US goes back to the beginning of the nineteenth century. In1803, William Stewart, the first US Consul at Smyrna, in Turkey, filed a reporton the trade in that port. He noted that, “Our trade with the East & West Indiesand South America will always afford us the means of supplying Turkey with[opium] the principal articles of its consumption.”21 Stewart reported thatTurkey was an important source of drugs and of opium. By the 1820s Americanswere shipping hundreds of chests of Turkish opium to Southern Asia and China.Guess who was making the money?A November 1996 report by the Paris-based Observatoire Geopolitique des Drogues,or Geopolitical Observatory of Drugs, first identified Turkey as a key player inthe region’s accelerating drugs-for-arms traffic. Heroin-dealing Albaniannationalists, both in the ethnically divided nation of Macedonia and the newmini-narco-state of Kosovo, had built a vast network, stretching via Turkey fromthe Golden Crescent to black-market arms dealers in Switzerland. According tothis report, the amount of drugs originating from Afghanistan was worth nearly$40 billion in the final stage. That’s 40 billion dollars of heroin on thestreet! That’s more than Afghanistan’s Gross Domestic Product ($35 billion). Itwould be safe to assume that primitive and barely literate Afghan warlords arenot the brains behind the transportation, chemical processing, distribution andextremely sophisticated laundering of the proceeds through most of the world’sfinancial markets.According to the US State Department’s most recent annual InternationalNarcotics Control Strategy Report, “Turkey’s position astride the main overlandtrade route between Asia and Europe makes it a significant transit point fornarcotics.” The country serves as the land-bridge for some 60 tons a year,three-quarters of world’s heroin transported for use in Western Europe, aprimary victim of the drug war, from its origin in Afghanistan.The key component in Turkey’s part in the global drug trade is its geography.Turkey, one of the closest American allies as well as one of the key members ofthe NATO alliance, occupies a unique place among the modern nation-states. Itlies at the crossroads not only between Europe and Asia, but also between theformer Soviet Union and the Middle East. It is also the only Middle-Easternnation that has counted Israel as a close ally and collaborator.The Balkan Route is divided into three sub-routes with Turkey always playing akey role: the southern route, which runs through Turkey, Greece, Albania andItaly; the central route, which runs through Turkey, Bulgaria, the FormerYugoslav Republics of (Macedonia, Serbia, Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia, andBosnia and Herzegovina), Italy or Austria; and the northern route, which runsfrom Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania to Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic,Poland or Germany.According to statistics available for 1998, Turkey’s heroin trafficking broughtin $37.5 billion.22 This was equivalent to nearly a quarter of Turkey’s GrossDomestic Product.As one former FBI agent wrote, “Only criminal networks working in closecooperation with the police and the army could possibly organize trafficking onsuch a mind-boggling scale.” Turkish government complicity became more clear asearly as January 1997, when Tom Sackville, minister of state at the British HomeOffice publicly affirmed that “members of the Turkish government were involvedin drug trafficking.”23Members of the government, yes. But the government itself is generally workinghard to eradicate the drug trade. It hasn’t been easy for them. Turkey has beenstunned by the indictment of a criminal network, the Ergenekon, for planning amilitary coup against the government. On July 15, 2008 Istanbul Chief Prosecutorsubmitted the indictment against the Ergenekon to Turkey’s high criminal court.The 2,455-page indictment named 86 suspects, 48 of whom are currently incustody, including retired – and possibly current – members of the armed forces,as well as academics, journalists, political activists, and organized crimefigures.Turkey has its work cut out. Back in the 19th century, the Chinese governmenttried, but failed, to prevent Britain from imposing opium on its population.Turkey is hoping its efforts will prove to be more successful. There is simplytoo much at stake for the oligarchs who run the world and who earn fabulouswealth from the nefarious drug trade to simply let an upstart Turkey get in theway.Nonetheless, Turkey is playing a leading role in going after themulti-billion-dollar drug network responsible for trafficking heroin fromAfghanistan. In the process, Turkey serves as a key flank against theempire-builders’ new opium wars. According to knowledgeable military sources,the Kurdistan Workers Party, financially supported by the European oligarchy,has been linked to a massive conspiracy to overthrow the Erdogan government inTurkey. A nation-state like Turkey, the only constitutionally secular nation inthe Islamic world, may prove a bulwark against both radical Islam and globalrule by a financier oligarchy.Moreover, recent breakthroughs in the global war on drugs, beginning with thestunning July 2, 2008 rescue of French-Colombian dual citizen and a formerColombian Presidential candidate, Ingrid Betancourt, and three Americanhostages, from FARC narcoterrorists in Colombia, suggest that the “invisiblehand of the oligarchy may no longer be so invisible.”24 What happened was a verysophisticated operation, dubbed “Operation Checkmate,” carried out by elementsof the Colombian government in conjunction with the country’s Special Forces andhigh-ranking military command, with intelligence support from France, includingthe institution of the Presidency, and institutional elements within the UnitedStates.But Turkey occupies a unique position with respect to the designs of theoligarchs. Their purpose is to perpetuate the secret Sykes-Picot Treaty, whichwas drafted in 1916 by the soon-to-be “victors” of World War I, France and theBritish Empire, in which they divided up the Ottoman Empire between them as thespoils of war, with Britain controlling Iraq, Jordan, and Palestine, and Franceruling Syria and Lebanon. Their aim has been to prevent at all costs theeconomic development of a region that is at both the crossroads of Europe andAsia and of Eurasia and Africa. Their intent is to maintain it as trigger forglobal war by manipulating ethnic, religious, and tribal groups against oneanother, and against central governments, to create perpetual war. What they areafter is a modern form of feudal anarchy.Perpetual conflict destroys progress and severely limits the rights of theindividual. Stability is bad for business, drug business that is. The drug tradethrives on weak central governments and strong sectarian leadership. Afghanwarlords provide a good illustration of these vile synergies. As one of theleading drug-traffickers wrote to his superior almost two hundred years ago inreference to China, “As long as this country maintains its drug traffic, thereis not the slightest possibility that it will ever become a military threat,since the habit saps the vitality of the nation.”25 Neither the means nor theintent have changed over the two-hundred-year period.Drugs, however, are only one aspect of the aforementioned topdown system. Turkeyalso plays a key role in industrial and military espionage. It is commonknowledge that the US government subsidizes $8 billion of Turkey’s $10 billionin weapons purchases. What’s more, “many Turkish companies establish bases ofoperations in the Muslim states of the former Soviet Union. These corporations,for being Turkish and allies of the US, have received millions of dollars in theform of the US government grants on behalf of the US Congress.”26One of the reasons for such a close collaboration between the two countries hasinvolved a mutual interest in containing Soviet/Russian expansion, and this hasprovided the foundation of United States-Turkish relations over the past sixtyyears. Another reason for such generous financial help is because Turkey is akey ally of Israel. Yet, most of the corporations involved are fronts fororganized crime, which include everything from money laundering to drugtrafficking to arms smuggling. Still, the United States transfers its technologyto a country that ranks high on global narcotics, terrorism and weapons of massdestruction-related activities, while at the same the US government is hard atwork to cover up the terrorists’ main financial source: drug trafficking andillegal arms sales.There is no end in sight to the deceit, greed, corruption and double-crossespractised in the world of cut outs, special operations, phantom corporations,offshore secret accounts, unscrupulous corporate greed and centuries-longconspiracies. The essential feature of any great conspiracy, as someone oncesaid, is not the dark plotting. Rather, superior motivation is what causes theleaders to conspire together. Money is not the essence of any long lastingconspiracy. Neither is the megalomaniacal desire for power. I believe that asmallish group of people sustaining a conspiracy over hundreds of years requiresa powerful sort of ideological motive.In the case of drug-funded oligarchs and their cohorts, beginning with theBritish East Indian Company, the ideological motive is the hatred of the idealof sovereign nation-state republics, of individual liberties and the pursuit ofhappiness, and of technological progress. As we turn the next and the next andthe next corner, we find ourselves enveloped in mind boggling corruption,impunity and disregard for international mores, decency and boundaries. “Peace”and “prosperity” have been sold to the highest and most morally corrupt bidder.Notes1. “Life in the Balkan Tinderbox Remains as Dangerous as Ever,” Jane’sIntelligence Review, March 1, 1999.2.

The storyspans several continents and involves a large network of shady individuals,front companies and government officials; corrupt African bureaucrats andthieving East European military officials.”2We are told that he, more than most, has succeeded in exploiting the anarchy ofglobalization, making possible massacres on a scale that has stunned the world.Much of his personal history we are led to believe is unknown; much may be afigment of his own fertile imagination. According to a Men’s Journal article,“Viktor Bout has been so good at concealing his past that American intelligenceagents who have tracked him for years joke that his birth was an immaculateconception.”3 On paper, at least, it appears that Bout is one of the most amoralmen alive. His colorful story piqued my curiosity and shortly after 9/11, Idecided to investigate. My investigation would eventually take me to the fourcorners of the world and span almost a decade. The last leg of my exhaustingjourney took me to Bangkok, to KlongPrem prison, and to face-to-face meetingsand interviews with the so-called Merchant of Death, Victor Bout. What I foundout will forever help separate that which is fact from what is hearsay andfiction.Victor Anatoliyevich Bout was born in Russia on January 13, 1967, in Dushanbe,now the capital of Tajikistan, in the far reaches of Soviet territory. Hismother was a bookkeeper and his father an auto mechanic. He has one olderbrother, Sergey, who looks very much like him, born in 1961. After graduatingfrom secondary school, Bout applied to the Soviet Foreign Ministry’s MoscowState Institute of International Relations. Unable to pass the entry exam, hewas drafted into the Soviet Army. Upon completion of obligatory militaryservice, he applied to the Moscow Military Institute of Foreign Languages, afour-year program that would have made him a Lieutenant upon graduation.However, instead of studying its full course, he was offered a shorter option –a year and a half of intense courses in Portuguese and a rank of JuniorLieutenant, followed by two years of obligatory service in Mozambique as amilitary interpreter.But chance intervened with a sort of fumbling coherence, and the world andVictor Bout would never be the same again. I have learned that chance plays animportant, if not predominant, part in human affairs. The fact that a man likeVictor Anatoliyevich Bout should so much as go to Africa and to Mozambique, notto mention find himself in the position he currently finds himself in, locked upand in leg chains at the worst prison in all of Southeast Asia, is alone eerilyintriguing. That in time he should ultimately owe his freedom to the very USgovernment that has tried to put him in prison in the first place isbreathtaking in its absurdity.When Bout failed to catch on at Moscow State Institute of InternationalRelations, chance reared its gangly head. There was a dearth of translators inMozambique, so Bout was offered to do an accelerated, one-and-a-half yearprogram, with an emphasis on one language – Portuguese, instead of a fullfour-year program in Moscow.Upon completion of this program, Bout became a Lieutenant Junior Grade, afterwhich he was posted as a military translator in Mozambique on a two-year stint.At the end of this period, having shown his aptitude for languages and generallybeing considered a brilliant translator by his superiors, Bout was all set tofinish his higher education, per the initial agreement with the government, bycompleting the remaining two and a half years of studies in Moscow. But theSoviet Union began its implosion, and Bout decided to forego the remaining yearsof his career. His life, and for that matter ours, was never the same again.He speaks Russian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, English and Farsi. According toinvestigator Ruud Leeuw, his IQ is said to be more than 170, putting him in thetop .0002% (one in five million) of the world’s population. I got in touch withMr. Leeuw through his website.After identifying myself, I got straight to the point.“170 IQ. That’s pretty high. How do you know this? Did you measure it yourself,or do you have a psychological-evaluation report on Bout?”“Well, I don’t really know myself. That’s what they say. My interest in VictorBout is limited; I am a photographer … Contrary to the impression to what mywebsite may give you … I stumbled upon him while trying to research the historyof certain aircraft … keep track of those same planes … and things took off. Doyou know what I mean?”“Actually, Ruud, I don’t know what you mean,” I persisted. “You are building aprofile of a man. Your name appears on several official reports. Thus, you are acredible source for many people. Who told you Bout has an IQ of 170?”“I think it was Richard Chichakli.”“Bout’s former associate?”“Exactly.”“So, you spoke to Chichakli.”“Not personally, but I read it in a newspaper interview.”“If Chichakli said it, why don’t you source it? I mean, why didn’t you put it inquotes, attributing this information to him?”“I have no interest in conspiracy theories in any way, nor am I particularlyinterested in illegal arms trade. It’s just a personal web page,” he repliedapologetically, clearly uncomfortable.“And Bout is just an arms dealer, according to many.” I hung up without sayinggoodbye. I was once again in the land of the Shadow Masters.Now I am a Russian by birth, but consider myself a citizen of the world, withrespect for sovereignty, self-determination and self-reliance. My lifeexperiences have given me a strong appreciation of what man’s freedoms andliberties are worth. Exiled as a child with my family from the USSR – because ofmy father’s political beliefs – then coming of age in the West, becoming acitizen of Canada, marrying a Spanish lady and living in Spain and Italy foryears, has given me an appreciation of the freedoms and unlimited opportunitiesthat many take for granted. I understand the value of a free press, and of aneducated, civically involved population, to the health of any nation-state.As I pulled back the curtain during my research, the implausibility of it allamazed me, snapping me out of the thralldom of the official story. For just as“legends” (cover stories/false IDs) are created for our own spooks, it seemsthat legends may also be conveniently created for our enemies’. Let’s see, thegood guys wear the white hats and the bad guys the black ones, right? Let’s allhiss at the villain on cue …The Guardian of London, one of the UK’s most prestigious newspapers, stated thatBout “holds at least five passports and uses as many as seven aliases. Hisaliases include Boutov, Butt, But, Budd, Bouta, all with Victor or Viktor as thefirst name. Two of his passports are issued in the names of Vadim Aminov andVictor Bulakin, according to inside sources in the British Foreign Service andthe US State Department.”4 The insinuation is clear. The Merchant of Death, amost-sought-after international criminal, would certainly hide under falseidentities in order to avoid capture.Stephan Talty writing for Men’s Journal described the lead-up to Bout’s 2008arrest in Bangkok. “Snow drifted down from a malevolent black sky as a stocky,mustachioed man arrived at Moscow’s airport on the evening of March 5…. He hadchosen carefully among his five passports. The names on them varied, but theywere all versions of his given one: Viktor Bout. He had spent years carefullyblurring almost every trace of his past, but what is known is that he’d servedin the Soviet military in the 1980s, working as a navigator, training commandosfor its air force, and flying to Angola to act as a translator.”5According to his publisher, Stephan Talty “is a widely published journalist whohas contributed to the New York Times Magazine, GQ, Men’s Journal, and manyother publications. Through Random House, I got in touch with him.“Stephan, in your article for Men’s Journal you wrote …” I repeated thesnow-drifted arrival described above. “Were you there? Did you see it yourself?”“No, of course I wasn’t there.”“Did you get it from the DEA?”“It is a lead-in. Do you know what a lead-in is? I am setting the scene,” heclarified.“I know what a lead-in is. Except that when the first sentence is a fabrication,I might suspect that the rest of the article is too. Do you know what I mean?”“Whom do you work for again?” he asked, his voice more cautious, edgy.I ignored him. “You also say that Bout had chosen carefully among his fivepassports.” I paused. “Where did you get this from?”“What?”“That he had five passports?”“I got it from the DEA and from the Internet,” came the reply.“You did? And how do you know it’s true?”“Are you a conspiracy theorist?”“No, I am a coincidence theorist. So, how do you know he has five passports?”Silence.“All right. One more question. According to your article, in the 1980s, Boutworked as a navigator, training commandos for the Soviet air force.”Silence.“Let’s do the math, shall we? He was born in 1967. If we take the 1980s as 1987or 1988, Bout would have been nineteen, twenty, at most. Are you suggesting thata twenty-year-old was training elite commandoes of the Soviet armed forces?”“Look, it’s just background. We know what he is.”“Who is we, Stephan? The government, the mainstream press, your family,beer-drinking America, or people who work at Random House?”“Look, if you want to find out more about Bout, talk to the DEA.”“I will, count on it. I wanted to know what you knew about Bout before writingan article on him. It is obvious, you don’t know much.” There was a click.Widely published author Stephan Talty had nothing else to add.So, what’s the real story with Bout’s apparent numerous aliases and endlesspassports and why are the Guardian of London, New York Times, CNN, BBC andnumerous other publications so diligently trying to ram their version down ourthroats? In fact, as I found out, he only has one passport.The rest of the mainstream story is setting the scene, background noise made toappeal to the uninitiated and the gullible. A number of the supposed aliasesattributed to Bout are variant spellings of his surname when the Cyrillicalphabet of Russian is transliterated into the Roman letters of English and mostEuropean languages. According to tradition, the evangelist Cyril, later St.Cyril, devised an alphabet adapted from the Greek in order to bring the Gospelsto the mostly pagan and illiterate Slavic tribes. In Russian, the name is[images/00002.jpg].Two letters are derived from Greek beta. By chance, the one most resemblingEnglish “B” represents the non-Greek sound of “V,” while the “B” sound isrepresented by the letter beginning Bout’s surname. “K” is “K” and “T” is “T.”“P” represents the English “R” sound. (You are likely to recall the ubiquitous“CCCP” [USSR] on tanks and athletes from the Soviet era.) So much for theconsonants. With the knowledge that “O” is “O” and that “M” represents English“I,” Bout’s given name is discernible: Viktor, or the more familiar Victor, takeyour pick. Most sources seem to agree on this point.His surname can be rendered as Bout, Butt or But, depending on the systememployed. The spelling we see most often – Bout – results from the older,traditional system based upon French pronunciation. Beginning in 1996, theRussian Ministry of Foreign Affairs changed to an Anglicized system, which, in atypically chaotic post-Soviet manner, lacked a uniform methodology. Thus BHKTOPB became DEA-invented Victor Butt. However, supplying an ordinary Englishpronunciation under any of the spellings doesn’t approximate the Russian name,which has a “U” sound more like “put” than “but.”The fact is that the alleged arms dealer has had three passports: an old Sovietone, his first Russian passport as “Bout” in accordance with the former Frenchtransliteration rules, and a more recent Russian passport as “But” according tothe newer rules. I think Bout is resigned to hearing his name mispronounced inEnglish: “bout” as rhyming with “out.” But I find it remarkable that “Butt” hasnot become the standard, given the demonization of the man himself and thecommon meanings of that English word.The other two names ascribed to him by the intelligence agencies, Westerngovernments and the mainstream press are the names appearing on US extraditionrequest documents in its unsealed indictment of Bout: Vadim Markovich Aminov andViktor Bulakin. These are the names of real people who lived and worked inSharjah, United Arab Emirates, at the same time Victor Bout was there. Aminov,the owner of a travel agency in Sharjah catering to Russians, for example, wasoverheard on a wiretap talking to Victor Bout.Later on, the same voice was confused for Bout’s voice, and Aminov’s name waswritten into Bout’s file as another one of his aliases. Aminov and Bout are twodifferent people, the only similarity being that the two men spoke Russian andeach wore a bushy moustache. Why was Aminov talking to Bout? Who knows? However,it is only reasonable for Aminov and Bout to have known each other, as mostexpatriates stay in touch with fellow countrymen in a foreign land, especiallyin a place as different as Sharjah is from Moscow.In another interesting revelation, British military intelligence reported thatBout was stationed in Rome with the KGB between 1985 and 1989. I heard thisinformation on CNN and, not too long ago, read it in Canada’s flagshippublication, the Toronto Star.Now, let’s see. Bout was born in 1967. In 1985, he would have been 17 years old.Is it reasonable to believe that a seventeen-year-old would be working for theKGB at its key European station? Hardly. Are we to assume that British militaryintelligence made a mistake, or, whatever its source, is this disinformationpart of a farsighted policy initiative against Bout? And if not against Bout,then against whom and, most importantly, for what purpose?What is known about Bout from mainstream press reports is that he is six feettall, “stocky, and usually sporting a baseball cap and a bushy moustache.” Atleast, that’s how Interpol had described him in their Most Wanted files. Inphotographs taken during Peter Landesman’s interview of him in Moscow in 2003,he is wearing an expensive olive-colored suit.Douglas Farah is considered by many to be the foremost expert on Bout’s illegalactivities. He is co-author of a best-selling exposé on Bout, Merchant of Death:Money, Guns, Planes, and the Man Who Makes War Possible, which certainly limitsany suspense regarding its protagonist. According to Farah, Bout had been aninstructor of elite Soviet commandos while a senior lieutenant in the air force.There is no evidence that he ever rose above junior lieutenant, and as I’venoted, twenty-year-olds did not train commandos of the Soviet military.Furthermore, the book is completely lacking in primary sources of information.There are no names provided. References are always made to “European, Pakistani,US investigators … sources in the State Department … contacts in the DEA …government officials …” Etcetera.However, I decided to triple check. One can never be too careful. I sent DouglasFarah an email message on September 21, 2009.Doug, this is Daniel Estulin, again. I would like to clarify a point in yourbook. You say, “Until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Bout was an airforce senior lieutenant training recruits for the GRU, the elite commandos ofthe Russian Air Force, on a military base in Vitebsk, Belarus.”He was born in 1967. A copy of his latest passport is attached. If we do themath, he was barely out of his teens when he was purportedly training thesecommandoes. How do you explain this?A few days later, I got a reply from Farah stating that the passport I sent himwas “fake” and that Bout was “much older.”Once I got over the initial shock, I quickly sent him another query.“Please forgive my ignorance. But, what makes you think the passport is a fake?The Russian government in Bangkok has vouched for it. Or are you suggesting theyare in on the conspiracy? I am working on a deadest of deadlines for my book andwould dearly love to hear back from you at your earliest convenience.”I never heard back from Douglas Farah, Victor Bout-expert.Historically, Soviet military intelligence oversaw the flow of Russian militaryhardware and military services to friendly revolutionary movements around theglobe, especially in Africa and Central America, in accordance with its foreignpolicy objectives. According to one western intelligence official, “Bout’smilitary transport aviation regiment was disbanded in 1991, and essentially theywent private.” Alla Bout, Victor’s wife, explained to me that when the two ofthem came back from Mozambique at the end of 1991, the Soviet Union hadimploded. Bout’s junior lieutenant salary barely allowed them enough money tobuy an extra cup of coffee.Overnight, thousands of elite pilots and their crews found themselves out ofjobs. The Soviet system crumbled into oblivion before their very eyes. But, outof disaster arose opportunity. Dilapidated weapons, rusting spare parts, jeeps,tanks and clunky Soviet airplanes, which in most cases could be had for a priceof a Mercedes 600, attracted an instant clientele of former Soviet republics,rebel leaders and guerrilla armies in far-flung nations. Tin-cup dictators withoversized egos and shining medals hiding behind tacky plastic shades were onlytoo happy and eager to acquire Soviet surplus.And, according to mainstream press accounts, Victor Bout, who for years was justan unknown face on the edge of wartime photos, was only too pleased to servethem. As the Los Angeles Times reported, “During the chaotic period after thecollapse of the Soviet Union, Bout was among the Russian entrepreneurs whoseized opportunities to make a fortune.”7He allegedly started running guns to Afghanistan in the mid 1990s, and thendiscovered Africa. André Velrooy, a Norwegian journalist who investigated Bout’sactivities for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists’special issue of November 20, 2002, stated, “He had access to what the Africanwarlords wanted. The end of the Cold War resulted in a massive amount of surplusweaponry being dumped at often very low prices onto the private market.”According to the UN investigators at that time, “Bout traffics exclusively inweapons bought in the former Soviet bloc, mainly Russia, Bulgaria and Romania,”using his expertise and connections to expand weapons trade in Angola. “Localcarriers had the established routes and well-formed contacts in the area, butlacked capacity. Mr. Bout, through his numerous contacts in the ex-Soviet airforce, was immediately able to provide the required capacity and, in return,took advantage of the established routes and contacts in the southern Africanregion.”8According to the British secret service, US State Department documents andBelgian police reports, often cited in the mainstream press, what made Bout’snetwork extraordinary was its ability to deliver both small-caliber arms as wellas sophisticated weapon systems virtually anywhere in the world. His associates,ranging from former US military personnel and Russian officials to African headsof state and organized crime figures, gave him a lengthy list of buyers andsellers with whom to do business.United Nations Resolutions 1521 and 1532, as well as the Angola Report ofDecember 21, 2000 and Interpol intelligence documents, show Bout closely linkedwith several African dictators and rebel leaders, including the late Angolanrebel leader Jonas Savimbi, former Liberian president and accused mass murdererCharles Taylor, former Zairian president Mobutu Sese Seko, LibyanPresident-for-life Moammar Gadhafi, Jean-Pierre Bemba, leader of the CongoLiberation Front, as well as the former leaders of Congo-Brazzaville andnumerous others. It is said that it is next to impossible to pigeonhole hispolitical affiliations, however. That’s because he is completely apolitical. Idisagree.He is a Russian and he wears that distinction as a badge of honor. I can’treally explain it. You have to be a Russian to understand.What is undeniable, as Bout himself admits, is that in the 1990s Bout suppliedarms to Ahmed Shah Massoud, leader of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan. Boutdescribed Massoud “as a great friend with whom he had spent countless hourstalking about the everyday.” He sent an aircraft to rescue Mobutu Sese Seko, theailing and corrupt ruler of Zaire, even though he had supplied the rebels whowere closing in on Mobutu’s last stronghold.9 Bout bought a Gulfstream One usedby a Swedish expedition to fly to the North Pole.It is said that Bout cleverly combined legal and not-so-legal airlineactivities, often carrying legitimate wares such as fresh-cut flowers and frozencrayfish from South Africa to Europe. According to Bout himself, he flew over3,500 missions in Africa in one year. His most profitable enterprise was flyinggladiolus purchased for $2 in Johannesburg and resold for $100 in Dubai. Hetransported United Nations peacekeepers from Pakistan to East Timor, and formedpart of the logistics effort in Operation Restore Hope, the US-led militaryfamine relief effort in Somalia in 1993. In 1994, his aircraft flew 2,500 Frenchtroops into Rwanda. In 1997, he transported ostriches from Johannesburg in SouthAfrica to Saudi Arabia. Later that same year, he moved 50 elephants from SouthAfrica to Angola in specially outfitted cargo planes. In 2000, acting as abroker, he rented out his crew that transported hostage negotiators to thePhilippines, where European tourists were being held by the Islamist terroristgroup Abu Sayyaf. And then, in typical Bout turnaround style, we are led tobelieve, Abu Sayyaf became one of his clients shortly thereafter.I must admit that the notion of an amoral man selling death for profit isextremely unpalatable. The idea of living off someone else’s misery, fuelingconflicts the world over, makes me cringe. The first draft of this chapter was ascathing indictment of Bout, and of a world system that simply didn’t careenough about the weak and the oppressed.All I needed was one piece of evidence to put my mind at rest. One originalsource, one smoking gun, one voice recording, one fingerprint, one anything.Again, providence intervened in the most inexcusable way. I couldn’t findanything plausible or tangible on Bout. “Where is the proof, damn it, Merchantof Death? Why can’t I find it?”Proof, irrefutable proof of Bout’s guilt was nowhere to be found. Impossible!The man is guilty! He is a Merchant of Death. He sells arms. He profits fromwar. CNN, NBC, ABC, CBS, BBC, Time magazine, the Wall Street Journal, the NewYork Times, and the Washington Post all say so! Initially, I was dumbfounded,then I got angry at my inadequacy, then mystified at what I was seeing, thenpuzzled, and finally extremely alarmed.I had piles and piles of documents on top of piles and at the bottom of piles,filled with Bout’s alleged crimes. While he apparently crisscrossed the globeigniting war and hatred, I toiled in reference libraries from Toronto toFlorence and Madrid, searching in vain for primary sources of Bout’s crimes.Government bureaucrats quoted intelligence sources, intelligence sources quotedgovernment bureaucrats, UN officials quote intelligence sources, who in turnquoted UN reports. Where was the evidence? I was going out of my mind.“Intelligence reports show that Bout has … delivery was made to … people workingfor the Merchant of Death … the first breakthrough came when one of his closestcollaborators told the investigators that Bout …”Except that we have never found out what one of his closest collaborators toldthe government investigators, we have never seen his planes, nor him, anywherenear conflict zones, and intelligence agencies have never released theirfindings to the public. Even with the plethora of available technology, untilhis arrest in Bangkok in March 2008, few had ever heard his voice or seen him onvideo.Where was the proof? I needed to finish my book; my publisher was threatening tocut one finger off for every extra week I took to hand in the manuscript. Once,he called me at 3:00 A.M., telling me I had one week to hand in the (I can’trepeat what he said to me) manuscript. Still, I was looking for proof. I changedmy phone number, moved houses, changed continents and finally moved to Thailand.I was determined to get the despicable Merchant of Death.Lying in bed at night, I imagined Bout’s fat cheeks laughing at me. “You willnot find anything on me! I have it all hidden. I am an invisible man! They can’tget me!”I will get you. I promise you, Bout. Even, if I have to follow you to the endsof the Earth, I will find proof of your transgressions. We will put you inprison. You will not be a menace to society. I searched every sewer and everyback alley, called back every favor owed me by people in high and not so highplaces. “Get me the evidence! Get me something, anything!” I screamed at oneinformant. But, the harder I searched, the more I was beginning to realize thatI might never find one credible shred of evidence tying Victor Bout to even oneof the crimes he was being accused of committing. As a last resort, I went backto the mainstream press and re-read everything I had compiled on him. There wasa chance that in my haste, I had missed key evidence, overlooked keyinformation. It had to be there!According to an article in London’s Guardian newspaper, Bout “conducts hisillicit deals from the privacy of a walled compound in the Gulf state ofSharjah,”10 the third largest emirate in the United Arab Emirates. “Walledcompound.” Is it walled because Bout is a bad man and he needs to protecthimself from people trying to catch him? Is that why he “managed his legalactivities and clandestine deals” from a walled compound? What were theyinsinuating? Is it another case of numerous passports and aliases, of a bad mantrying to avoid detection? A real life Jason Bourne?In my efforts to get Bout, I travelled to Sharjah. Does the editor of theGuardian newspaper realize that every compound in Sharjah, and for that matterin the entire United Arab Emirates, is walled? It’s simply part of their cultureand aesthetics. Are we to assume they are all criminals? Supporters ofterrorists? Al-Qaeda lovers? Bin Laden followers?Summarizing mainstream accounts of Bout, we receive the following picture. Hisprivate fleet of old Soviet Antonov cargo aircraft, employing over 1,000 air andland personnel, has been based in Central African countries, South Africa andthe UAE of Sharjah, and his operations have prompted investigations in at leastfour countries – the United States, Belgium, Great Britain and South Africa.“What do you know about Bout?” asked the man from BBC-4 World Report. WhitneySchneidman of the United States State Department, quoting National SecurityAgency signal intelligence and intercepts, replied, “They told me that Victorhad a very efficient operation. They told me he had a great ability to move armsat will. It indicated that he had an ability to move money very quickly. He wasoperating on a scale much larger than anybody could imagine. He has a fleet offorty, fifty, sixty aircraft.”I did a double take. Wouldn’t a man from the State Department, armed with NSAintelligence reports and working on capturing Victor Bout know the exact numberof planes the Merchant of Death had at his disposal? Then, came the icing on thecake. I eagerly listened.Schneidman: “He delivered vast amounts of weapons, he was very agile in hismovements. He worked with a fax machine, a cell phone and pretty much that’sit.” I was about to scream, but then, something occurred to me. What if I calledthe State Department and told them that my publisher had two cell phones, a faxmachine and a Xerox machine in his garage. Would they be willing to put him awayfor a few months, at least, until I finished my book?A man who is familiar with Bout’s operation better than most is Lee ScottWolosky, former National Security Adviser and White House counterterrorismofficial under Presidents Clinton and George W. Bush. He is a partner at Boies,Schiller & Flexner LLP in New York, not to mention a life member of the Councilon Foreign Relations, an American arm of the all-powerful Bilderberg Group.“How many planes did Bout have in his heyday, Lee?”“I’d say close to two hundred.”“How many?” I thought I misunderstood.“He was all over the place. Most of Africa, Middle East, South-East Asia.”“Whitney Schneidman, in a BBC-4 interview said sixty, at most. What gives?”“He scaled back, you know, after we really went after him.” “But you didn’treally go after him, according to the US government, until after 9/11, Lee.That’s end 2001, beginning 2002,” I clarified. “When did he scale back?”“Beginning 2002.”“You mean, after moving back to Russia.”“Russia was his headquarters, but he was all over the place.”“Lee, according to a letter from the Russian government addressed to the Thaicourt in relation to his extradition hearing, Victor Bout travelled twice abroadsince he relocated to Moscow. One trip to Montenegro and the other to China.”What did Lee Wolosky have to say to that?“I can’t comment on that.”Okey dokey.Each time he was subjected to scrutiny, we are led to believe by the pressaccounts, he moved his airfreight operations elsewhere. Andre Velrooy, expert onVictor Bout matters with the International Consortium of InvestigativeJournalists, claims that Richard Chichakli, one of Bout’s many associates, saidthat he never saw him put his signature on a document. It makes one wonder whichof the many aliases he would use if he did.I called Chichakli in Moscow, where he has been residing in exile from the USsince his escape from Syria.“This is absolutely absurd,” he replied in a thick accent. “I have seen him signmany documents.”“What name did he use?” I asked him, trying to catch Chichakli in a lie.“His name, of course. Victor Bout.”In fact, I have personally seen Bout sign over a dozen court documents right infront of me, and seen his personal petitions to Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov.Of course, I might have just lucked out. In case you are wondering, hissignature is small and scratchy looking. I would hate to have to read anythingof his written out in longhand.Of course, journalists representing the corporate press wouldn’t know this, as Iam the only Western media representative to attend all of Bout’s court hearings.As is the case with the super secret Bilderberg Group meetings, I am the onlyWestern face to report on the comings and goings of the Shadow Masters. Why isthat?Still holding the phone in my right hand, I pulled out one of my manilaenvelopes; it had “Belgium” written across the top in bold, blue letters.Putting the phone down, I checked the case file and went on-line to read thefinal report. “I finally got you, Bout. You are mine!” I thought to myself. Isent my publisher an email.“I am on the home stretch. One more day!” I wrote triumphantly. Then, I read thereport, and my blood went cold. Bout’s involvement in the trade of war weaponswas an illusion according to what I was reading, found groundless in the finalsummation of the Court, to be mere politics, after being investigated, tested,and then discredited by the Royal Court in Belgium in case numberBR27.97.2780/97. What was truly painful to come to terms with for me was thefact that when the Belgian court asked for evidence, the US administrationfailed to produce any. Case closed. Bout is found not guilty.But CNN, the New York Times, the BBC? I was speechless and utterly confused. Themainstream media, they said Bout was a criminal, a monster. I want to believethem! I must believe them! My book, I mean, I have to publish it! Give me myproof, I deserve my proof. I have worked very hard at this!Still, I wasn’t going to give up this easily. Something stirred inside of me. Irecognized it right away. It was hope, the last thing to die. A man possessed, Iwent back to mainstream media reports.A confidant of dictators, warlords and guerrilla leaders, Bout juggled a murkygroup of companies for much of the 1990s,11 proclaimed the Los Angeles Times in2004. Having a toehold in South Africa gave him access to Swaziland, a tinylandlocked country in Southern Africa where he registered a total of 43aircraft, opening offices on August 20, 1997 of Air Cess Swaziland, anairfreight company that would later play an important role in the war in Iraq,proclaimed Ruud Leeuw who quoted the Center for Public Integrity, who in turnreferenced Douglas Farah and the Los Angeles Times.According to Bout himself, though, this is wrong. During his heyday in the mid1990s, the maximum number of aircraft he had was 29, including three Mi-8helicopters. The rest were old Antonov-8, Antonov-12, Antonov-72, Antonov-24,Antonov-32 and Il-76. In vain, I searched for the phantom 43, 60, 200 aircraft.They seemingly dropped off the face of the Earth.The complexity of Bout’s arms-trafficking networks and financial transactions,through myriad cut-out and shell companies, brokers, transportation companies,corporations, financiers and transshipment points, was intended to maketransactions untraceable, proclaimed Douglas Farah on CNN. “In the murky worldof arms trafficking, a Russian national has established himself as a premierplayer in Africa,” Farah further asserted in the Washington Post in February2002.12Bout used the balmy Persian Gulf state of the United Arab Emirates as hisprimary location for several reasons. For one thing, utter lack of regulationsrelated to weapons trafficking and aircraft registration put information abouthis clandestine operations on a purely need-to-know basis: No one asked and noone cared. For another, the Emirates are ideally situated for flight routes toAfghanistan and Africa, where Bout’s business was growing exponentially.Yet another attraction: The disintegration of the Soviet Union and opening up ofborders turned the duty-free Emirates into the vacationland of choice formarauding hordes of nouveau riche Russians. Seventy years of Communist austerityovernight had been turned on its head. For decades of the Soviet Union’sinexorable march under Communism, “the Russians,” as they became known in theEmirates and beyond, had been weaned on a daily diet of potato and beet salads.Now, they were being treated to mouth-watering delicacies from the farthestreaches of the globe. The Russians responded in kind, helping to quench seventyyears of hunger with mind-boggling consumption. Gluttony, in the early 1990s,becoming the primary cause of their hospitalization in Dubai. Bout saw theopportunity to multiply his wealth by catering to his countrymen’s increasinglyobscene and banal whims, selling them everything from Czar Nicholas II-shapedduty-free cellular phones to African-made gold plated statuettes of Lenin in aG-string.BOUT’S ENTERPRISES IMPACT A WIDER CIRCLEInitially, I thought that Western intelligence agencies were very slow tocomprehend important connections between weapons trafficking, diamond smugglingand links to the financial apparatus of terrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, whichwere covertly interlocked with clandestine groups in Europe and in Israel.Following Victor Bout’s associations led me to a network of Texas oil interests,Russian-Israeli mobsters, Muslim fundamentalists and off-the-book governmentblack operations. After tirelessly investigating these links and trying to makesense of their interlocked relationships, I understood that Bout was only anexample, a case study if you wish, of this underworld of the Shadow Masters.Something else has nagged at me, especially in the face of ever-mountinginconclusive evidence against the Russian arms dealer himself. Were Westernintelligence agencies “very slow” to comprehend links between weaponstrafficking, diamond smuggling and terrorism, or were these links and criminalsynergies allowed to take place and flourish? Why is it being insinuated byWestern governments and the official press that the Victor Bouts and hissupporting cast of characters are so much smarter than the United Statesgovernment, the FBI, the CIA, Interpol and the United Nations investigators? Andto what end? Could the demonization of the Bouts and the bin Ladens and theSaddam Husseins of the world simply serve as an extension of someone else’sforeign policy?One discovery of note came about as a result of an arrest in New York City inAugust 2003 of a diamond dealer, accused as part of a weapons smuggling ring.This Israeli-American and Afghanistan-born diamond dealer, Orthodox Jew YehudaAbraham, had business ties to the Saudi government and to the Saudi Royalfamily, as a provider of gems to many of its members.13 Abraham worked alongsideHemant Lakhani, an Indian-born Hindu clothing merchant from Mumbai’s prosperouscloth-trading Kutchi Lohana community.14 Lakhani, as it turned out, was an armsdealer with links to al-Qaeda and the ruling elites of the United Arab Emirates.During one of Lakhani’s many trips to East Africa, he met a key internationalarms dealer, Sanjivan Ruprah, an ethnic Indian and a politically well-connectedKenyan businessman.15 Ruprah, in turn, was associated in the press with VictorBout. I sent an email to Anil Padmanabhan, the journalist from India Today whohad made this startling revelation, asking for confirmation.In case you are wondering, I am still waiting. This doesn’t mean that Ruprah isnot connected to Bout. Simply, I couldn’t find any credible proof of it. Boutcategorically denies any dealings with him. In fact, he called Ruprah a “smalltime hoodlum.” This doesn’t mean I believe Bout either. The burden of proof ison me, and, to my chagrin, at this time I can’t find any. Not black and white,anyway, just shadows.For a long time, though, I was wondering where was the connection? The smokinggun? The fingerprint? Modus Operandi? How do we know these two are pals? Iwonder if when he approached the FBI, Ruprah brought a letter of introductionfrom Victor Bout. And Bout claims not to have any business dealings with Ruprah.Farrah and co-author Stephen Braun, in turn, claim they are pals andco-conspirators.Now I thought of the disastrous US proceedings against Bout in Thailand. In themultiple testimonies heard during the extradition hearing meant to back up theallegations, the agents of the United States government failed to deliver anyevidentiary matter in support of the allegations upon which their request forextradition was based. Exhibits the American legal team produced includedpictures of two cargo planes and Bout’s alleged notes during the supposedmeeting (more correctly, scribbled numbers and doodles on a 3×5 inch post-it).The decision of the Thai court explicitly stated, on page 49, ‘Although theprosecutor’s witness, Mr. Robert Sahari Vazevit, the head of investigation andinquiry who collected evidence connected with the accused’s trade of warweapons, came to testify for confirmation, it is found that the witness is theofficer of the United States who testified without any documentary evidencecontaining photographs or materials.”Surely, the US government had more evidence than that? According to the DEA,Bout’s capture had cost the agency over $30 million. Where was the proof of hisguilt? If the DEA went into this operation without adequate proof, heads wouldroll, I thought. If Bout is guilty, the Drug Enforcement Administration had thisone chance of nabbing him before he would disappear into the bowels of hisMotherland. No proof. What’s going on?My phone rang. I looked at the number flashing impatiently on the screen. 1-541-… I didn’t need to see the rest. My publisher, surely, was ruing the day he metme. Please, I thought to myself, just a little more time.Numerous open sources stated that Bout’s connections to arms deals were oftenobfuscated by a number of cut outs and middlemen, such as the aforementionedSanjivan Ruprah. Ruprah was being called, by some, “window dressing” to disguiseBout’s association with the notorious Ukrainian-Israeli citizen, Leonid Minin,leader of the ruthless Odessa Mafia.“Do you know him?” I asked Bout, sitting beside in court next to him. He, infour-pound leg irons over heavy wool grey socks, I in my multi-coloredflorescent socks and Pikolino runners.“Know who?”“Minin. Leonid Minin,” I repeated.“This is an invention of people who want to see me behind bars. I don’t know theman.”Bout, Minin, Ruprah, Lakhani, Abraham. Who next? On paper, they were allconnected to Bout. What if they too were permitted to be connected to Bout andhis empire as a result of someone’s farsighted policy decision? Still too soonto tell, I thought to myself.But these seemingly interlocked relationships amongst allegedly some of theworld’s most unsavory characters made me wonder: Was Abraham a cut out for theSaudi Royal family? If he was, then did the Saudis act independently or as asecondary cut out for someone else? Was the supposed someone else a nation or anindependent operator? After all, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United ArabEmirates are the only three nations in the world to have officially recognizedthe Taliban. Pakistan’s links to the Taliban and terrorism are well documented.I had been informed that the Emirates were being used as a money-launderingcenter by bin Laden, al-Qaeda and the Taliban. It was quite a stretch to imaginethe Saudis acting independently. But who were they covering for?Ken Silverstein, writing for the mainstream Washington Monthly, stated in themagazine’s January/February 2002 issue that Bout and Minin were longtime armssuppliers to former Liberian dictator Charles Taylor, and responsible fortransforming his allies, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in SierraLeone, from a rural army of 400 men in 1997 into a conventional army of 20,000by 1999. As “Bout’s man in Liberia,” Ruprah aided Bout in his frequent dealingswith Taylor. In return for his assistance, the RUF supplied Taylor with looteddiamonds from areas it controlled. Bout and his associates were given Liberiandiplomatic passports and, with Taylor’s blessing and protection, they registereda number of their front companies in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.16“How well do you know Taylor?” I screamed at Bout. He was in the visitor’s areaof prison, leaning against the glass, trying to make out what I was saying overthe cacophony of other prisoners, who were also straining to hear what was beingsaid to them.“Have never met him. Wouldn’t be caught in the same room with him!” he shoutedback in Russian, pressing his face against the small opening.He looked taller and thinner than his six feet, with a full head of short, brownhair parted strategically from left to right across his high forehead, dressedin a worn out, wrinkled, ill-fitted orange prison jump suit, brand new legirons, and wearing a smile of apologetic self-protection. His gaunt, stillyouthful face was betrayed by several deeply imbedded lines around the eyes,eyes that didn’t easily give away its secrets.“Do you have a Liberian diplomatic passport as the mainstream media alleges?”“How would I have a Liberian diplomatic passport if I have never dealt withTaylor?”In 2005, the UN Security Council Committee on Liberia identified Leonid Minin asone of Victor Bout’s closest associates and provided further personal details ofthe Odessa Mafia crime lord:Minin, Leonid EfimovichNationality: IsraelBolivian Passport: 65118Forged German Passports: 5280007248D, 18106739DGreek Passport: no detailsIsraeli Passports: 6019832, 9001689, 90109052Russian Passport: KI0861177Arms dealer in contravention of UNSC resolution 1343 – supported formerPresident Taylor’s regime in effort to destabilize Sierra Leone and gain illicitaccess to diamondsUN Security Council SC/8570, “Security Council Committee on Liberia UpdatesFreeze List”November 30, 2005Born in Odessa in 1947, Minin immigrated to Israel in the 1970s and establisheda global web of companies, many of them discreetly incorporated offshore.Minin’s primary business vehicle is Monacobased Limad AG, which also has officesin Switzerland, China, and Russia.Acting on a tip in Cinisello Balsamo, on the outskirts of Milan, Italian policearrested Minin in August 2000, writes investigative journalist Wayne Madsen,citing a PBS Frontline World Report. In his room, police found $500,000 worth ofuncut diamonds, a duffel bag filled with more than $35,000 in American, Italian,Hungarian and Mauritian currency, and over 1,500 documents, in Russian,Ukrainian, French, German, Dutch, English and Italian, relating to Minin’s widevariety of business operations. Specific findings included a record of a$10,263.02 payment to Marc Rich, an international financier and reputedRussian-Israeli-American Mafia don, soon to be known for his 11th-hour pardonfrom President Clinton on charges of fraud and extortion.According to Wayne Madsen’s sources, “The pardon of Rich was urged in a phonecall to Clinton by then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, as well as ShimonPeres and Ehud Olmert.”17 Why, I thought to myself, was Rich, a reputedRussian-Israeli-American Mafia don, attracting so much interest from the Israeligovernment and the President of the United States? Was he, too, a player, or washe being used as an extension of America’s or Israeli’s foreign policy? In whatcapacity did he serve the governments of Israel and/or the United States towarrant a Presidential pardon? Why would the President of the United States riska historical rebuke to pardon someone with such a dubious reputation? Was theIsraeli government a cut out or were they using Rich as a cut out for someunsavory black op?As Madsen notes, “In 1983, a little known US Attorney for the Southern Districtof New York had urged jail time for Rich for racketeering. The name of that USAttorney was Rudolph Giuliani. Marc Rich’s onetime lawyer was Vice PresidentDick Cheney’s former chief of staff, Scooter Libby.”18 Furthermore, Forbesmagazine puts out a Russian edition; its Moscow editor, Paul Klebnikov, wroteabout Rich’s connections to Boris Berezovsky, a business partner of Neil Bush,and also discussed this in his book, Godfather of the Kremlin. On July 9, 2004,Klebnikov was shot and killed gangland style on a Moscow street. Marc Rich’s oilcompany, Glencore, once shared a London phone number with one of Leonid Minin’scompanies, Galaxy Management.19 A world of Shadow Masters. A small world,indeed.After an exhaustive investigation, the Italian police concluded, “Minin was thehead of a Ukrainian criminal network associated with international drug andweapons trafficking, money laundering and extortion.”20 But, this was only thebeginning of the story.In February 2002, Belgian police arrested diamond- and armssmuggler SanjivanRuprah for using a false passport. Frontline, in a special report on illegalarms and diamond trafficking in Africa, reported that Ruprah “was directlyinvolved in the operations of Leonid Minin’s arms sales to Liberia, and ownsdiamond mines in Liberia.”21 A Bout-Minin link was confirmed by Bout himself,according to a New York Times Magazine article.22Bout claims his relationship with Minin is a fabrication, and that he never saidhe had any. Bout’s wife Alla showed me an email from Peter Landesman, the authorof the famed Bout exposé in the New York Times Magazine. It was sent before thearticle came out. Landesman apologizes ahead of time for the article’s finalversion, pleading clemency and claiming that even though he wanted to write atrue report on Victor Bout, his big, bad editor had other ideas.His article was a hit piece, forever cementing Bout’s reputation as a Merchantof Death. Incidentally, both Peter Landesman and Douglas Farah have landed juicyHollywood option deals as a result of their relentless Bout coverage. Landesmanhas produced a screenplay titled Arms and the Man. This work has been picked upby Universal studios, part of the Vivendi SA empire, one of the world’s topmedia groups, and will be directed by Michael Mann, who has done such films asThe Last of the Mohicans and Collateral. In Landsman’s screenplay, Bout the badguy is involved in a plot to steal plutonium from the Ukraine, but later turnsinto a good guy after his brother, Sergei, is killed. There is also talk of avideo game based on the film.Vivendi Universal was formed in 2000, “through the merger of Vivendi, a Frenchmultimedia group, and Edgar Bronfman’s Seagram Co. Ltd. Seagram had, in 1995,bought MCA, including MCA’s Universal movies division, with its 14.7% share ofthe US box-office market. Universal Music bought up PolyGram, and now owns thecopyrights works by to Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, the Jackson Five, U2, EltonJohn and, among others, 50% of the “Gangsta Rap” label Interscope. In 2006,General Electric acquired an 80% stake, thus creating the current NBC Universalthrough a merging of GE’s NBC unit and Vivendi’s Vivendi Universal Entertainmentgroup.“Vivendi’s boss Jean-Claude Messier himself was, from 1986-88, responsible forthe French government’s privatization program. Then, he joined the influentialUS-French investment bank Lazard Frères [a key bank in the Bilderberg Grouppower structure] before he took over the Lyon-based water utility Générale desEaux, which he transformed into the Vivendi media group.“The big media conglomerates share part of the business with the biggestmilitary producers. Many of the games are based on Hollywood film scripts, likeTerminator or Mission: Impossible, and rely on intellectual property rights soldor leased by the original film producers, who share part of the royalties incomeand have a lot of political clout.”23Fact and fiction, real life and Hollywood, shadows and the Shadow Masters. Thelines, at least in this tale are blurred on more than one occasion. Consideringthat Landesman and Farah are two of the more visible anti-Bout crusaders, couldtheir Hollywood good fortune simply be a payoff for creating an erroneousillusion of Bout for public consumption?Another project is an outgrowth of Douglas Farah’s work Blood from Stones. Thefilm will have a fictitious plotline sprinkled with factual information. Bout’scharacter will take a back seat to former Liberian strongman Charles Taylor andhis merry band of thugs.“Why did you agree to the [Landesman] interview?” I asked Bout.“It was Chichakli. For over six months he tried to convince me. I didn’t have agood feeling about it, but he insisted.”“Did Landesman record the interview?”He shook his head. “He took down notes.”Good idea, I thought to myself. If you were going to write a hit piece onsomeone, don’t leave evidence behind. “Why didn’t you record it yourself?” Iasked him incredulously.“I trusted him.”Can it really be that simple? I thought to myself.“The exploits of Bout and Ruprah in [Africa’s] worst killing fields are thesubject of numerous United Nations reports on mercenary activity, diamondsmuggling and arms trafficking in Angola, Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republicof the Congo, Liberia, Uganda and Rwanda.”24 According to UN investigators,“Ruprah was tied to the illicit diamond trade in West Africa and arranged forBout to be paid for his weapons deliveries with diamonds from Sierra Leone.”Even if we are to take this piece of evidence at face value without checking forprimary sources, I thought to myself, we would have to assume that if the UnitedNations investigators knew, then, so did the US government. Yet, again, nothingof substance was being done. Bout was still active; the weapons were gettingthrough, feeding some of the worst atrocities and abuses in human history. Why?Initially, none of it made sense, at least not until I understood the ShadowWorld of the Men behind the Curtain. You see, if what we are being told is true,that is, in a real world, a Victor Bout would not have existed, becausegovernments have the diplomatic, financial and intelligence clout to eliminatethe elements that threaten their sovereignty and the rule of law.Unless, of course, “arms-for-diamonds” and other scenarios were being used as anextension of a farsighted agenda, designed from the behind the scenes at some ofthe most prestigious think tanks and foundations. Vivendi and General Electric,Lazard Frères and the Bilderberg Group. As I later discovered, this is exactlywhat was happening.DIAMOND TRADINGDiamonds can be sold easily on the international black market, but the financialtrails of the transactions are virtually non-ex istent, and undetected byinternational law enforcement.25 Shockingly little is known about the politicaland criminal twilight world that conceals the commerce of international diamondtrading. Diamond dealers the world over are known by the Hebrew term yahalommanin. Jewish diamond dealers strike deals based on a handshake and the Hebrewwords mazal ubracha, or “luck and be blessed.” As with Islamic hawalahs,payments for diamonds are wired around the world through a variety ofpass-through companies and middlemen.26 Gems can be brought or sent halfwayaround the world for inspection without any guarantee of purchase. In thisenvironment, your good name is worth everything. “Disputes are settledinternally at peer-review courts. Wrongdoers face a penalty more serious thanjail – expulsion from the diamond community.”27The Hasidic community in London’s Hatton Garden is considered one of the leadingcenters for diamond smuggling and money laundering. “The gem trade appeals tomoney launderers because, following the introduction of new banking regulations,it is one of the few remaining industries where large cash transactions can becarried out with complete anonymity. There is an environment of almost completesecrecy and it is a very cash-intensive marketplace. These are all things thatmoney launderers find very attractive.”28 One of Osama bin Laden’s toplieutenants, Wadih el Hage, now serving a life sentence for his role in the 1998US Embassy bombing in Kenya and Tanzania, visited Hatton Garden to raise fundsfor al-Qaeda by smuggling tanzanite gems from Tanzania.29Such a means of raising funds points to another benefit of dealing in diamonds.They are very easy to transport, much more so than gold or even paper money.Gold, for example, has lately been selling for over one thousand dollars pertroy ounce. Depending upon quality, a diamond may be worth several thousanddollars per carat. As one carat is one fifth of a gram, there are over 155carats in a troy ounce. The value to any high-priced illicit trade of bothdiamonds and diamond experts is thus apparent.Over the past decade, Israel’s intelligence agency responsible forcounterterrorism and covert operations, the Mossad, has become aware thatterrorist groups such as al-Qaeda, Hamas and Hezbollah launder money throughdiamonds in places like West Africa without detection by international financialsurveillance authorities. These findings reveal additional background onterrorist links to diamond smuggling.Lebanese Shiite immigrants, fleeing economic depravation, first arrived in WestAfrica at the beginning of the 20th century.30 They were welcomed by the Britishcolonial authorities, who saw in their arrival an opportunity to displace localmerchants in commodity trade with the African interior. After diamonds werediscovered in eastern Sierra Leone in 1930, Lebanese traders quickly gainedcontrol of this lucrative market.31 More recently, as the Middle EastIntelligence Bulletin of June/July 2004 reported, “The most lucrative source offunds [for terrorists] was the Lebanese diamond traders of Sierra Leone … anumber of powerful Lebanese gem merchants … helped the brutal Liberian-backedRevolutionary United Front (RUF) sell diamonds from mines under its control.”The United Nations Angola Report issued December 21, 2000 had first brought theissue of the “conflict diamonds” trade to the world’s attention. It detailedhow, in many regions in Africa, civil strife has turned into all-out war overdiamond-mining territory, gems that end up paying for African wars at the costof millions of lives. “The proceeds from the diamonds are then used to buyillicit weapons and deepen the conflicts.”32 These arms, sold by shadowymerchants, have often ended up in the hands of child soldiers, as was the casein Sierra Leone and Angola, two of the leading employers of child soldiers incombat operations. To get these child soldiers to fight, the rebel forces fedthem cocaine and amphetamines, thus negating whatever compassion the childrenmight have felt for their victims; they played real soldiers “rampaging throughthe countryside, killing, mutilating, raping, and pillaging until they collapsedfrom fatigue and hunger.”33In the Congo, Hezbollah simply “muscled their way into the business and beganpurchasing diamonds directly from miners and local middlemen at a fraction oftheir market value.”34 A glimpse into the scale of Hezbollah profits from thediamond trade came in December 2003, “when a Union des Transports Africainsairliner loaded with Lebanese passengers crashed off the coast of Benin – onboard, according to news reports and Western diplomats in Sierra Leone, was aHezbollah courier carrying $2 million.”35It’s important to understand that, although most experts mention al-Qaeda andHezbollah in the same breath when terrorist links to the diamond trade arediscussed, the modi operandi of the two organizations are quite different.Al-Qaeda, with its global reach, buys diamonds as a way of hiding money, whereasHezbollah, a regional player in the Middle East, is involved to make money.Terrorism truly has become a global enterprise, not only in matters of warfarebut in the way these organizations tap into existing distribution routes anddelivery systems.Hezbollah is a Shi’a Islamic militia and political and paramilitary organizationbased in Lebanon, whose name is translated as “The Party of God.” It grew out ofa collapse of the Lebanese political system in the 1970s under the impact of thePalestinian guerrilla movement. A 1978 Israeli invasion was followed in 1982 bya fullscale Israeli assault aimed at driving out the Palestine LiberationOrganization (PLO). This resulted in more than 30,000 people losing their lives.In one of the most documented massacres of late 20th century, the Israeli armystood by as hundreds were massacred by Lebanese Christians in the Sabra andShatila refugee camps, where many Lebanese Shi’a had sought refuge. In thisenvironment, Hezbollah emerged and grew.DIAMONDS AND BIN LADENAnd that brings us to Osama bin Laden’s connections to the Israeli diamondtrade. Here is some information I received from one of my most trusted sources,showing some correspondence between him and one of his sources, referred to asABC.ABC: “On the last day of October 2001, Osama bin Laden finally realized that hewas trapped between the Northern Front and the US forces. Traditional escaperoutes were all cut off. He called an old business partner, who whisked Osamaand his party of 26 people to Africa on a private jet on November 4 [2001]. Youmay find it rather surprising, but you must understand that in the ancientmiddle eastern world of tradition and rituals, which may seem utterly absurd toa Western person, a business partnership is based on years of trust, and it istotally separate from political or national loyalties. This trusted ally was anIsraeli.“During Osama’s exile in Sudan in the 1990s, he was clandestinely approached byIsraelis who wanted him to take over the African diamond business from theLebanese. Traditionally, Muslims were the guardians of the raw diamond trade inWest Africa. They provided the logistics and the muscle. The Israelis’proposition to Osama was quite simple. They wanted for the wily Saudi to takethe trade away from the Shiites. You see, the idea of suicide bombers fromsouthern Lebanon being financed by the Israeli-run diamond trade out of Antwerp,Belgium, turned their stomach. Osama was feared and respected by the terrorists.It would take a battle hardened bin Laden to get the job done.”“Why would a Saudi terrorist want to deal with the Israelis.”ABC: “You see, neither Osama bin Laden nor the Taliban were anti-Jewish. In thecase of the Taliban [mostly Pashtuns], the Pashtun tribe of Afghanistan is oneof the ‘lost tribes of Israel.’ Their customs and names are identical to thoseof the Jews. As for the bin Ladens, the family is of Yemeni-origin and the manwho started the dynasty, Mohamed Bin Awad bin Laden, was a contractor who becameone of the wealthiest men in the world. Mohamed bin Laden had numerous wives,too many to count, as he always married into the people who lived in the placeswhere he was working in order to become one of them and not be looked at as astranger. As a result, the family construction empire routinely dealt withJewish businessmen through Yemen for building materials and equipment. That’show Osama’s father got rich. Since Saudis could have no direct dealings with theJews, the bin Ladens used Yemenis, who lived alongside Jews in their Yemenihomeland.“Once bin Laden wrestled control of the raw diamond trade away from the Shiites,he became an instant billionaire. The diamonds were sent from West Africa to theRussian Mafia through Osama’s trusted diamond courier, who used a verynon-Muslim name of Cyril Jacob. The Mafia then sold them to the Jews inAntwerp.”This information comes from a former US Naval Intelligence officer who has alsoworked for the National Security Agency, and maintains a network of contacts inthe intelligence communities. In one of our conversations, he dropped thisbombshell, citing one of his intelligence sources in Peshawar, Pakistan. Thissource was a “high value target,” someone recruited from a foreign intelligenceagency. This source has not “come in from the cold,” meaning has not physicallydefected to the recruiting country; thus, if found out, the source will beassassinated.This information from the source dovetailed very nicely with the activities ofthe Afghani Jew, Yehuda Abraham, president of Ambuy Gem Corp., his diamondbusiness with the Saudi Royal family, his arrest for involvement in a Russianshoulder-mounted-missile-launcher smuggling ring including Hemant Lakhani, whoin turn was linked to various client terrorist organizations. The multipleunrelated dots proverbially came together.As you now may begin to realize, seemingly extraneous information acquires adegree of importance in our story: Abraham’s primary clientele was the Saudiroyal family. It was also discovered that Abraham was operating a hawalah – anIslamic money transfer network based on trust and a handshake – from his diamondbusiness. It was that hawalah that was used to transfer money from weapons salesout of the United States without leaving a trace. Was Abraham being used as anextension of bin Laden’s “foreign policy”? If yes, by whom, bin Laden himself orby the United States government? And to what end? Were the United Statesgovernment and the intelligence agencies on purpose “very slow” to comprehendthe links between weapons trafficking, diamond smuggling and terrorism?In light of this speculation, is it possible that Osama bin Laden was referringto al-Qaeda’s diamond-smuggling network during his interview with the Pakistaninewspaper, Ummat? In it, on September 28, 2001, he noted that al-Qaeda uses“three alternative financial systems that are separate and independent,” addingthat any attempt to remove them would not succeed.In this context, it is surely no surprise that in the mid 1990s, the city ofDubai, al-Qaeda’s premier money laundering center in the Middle East, became amajor rival to Antwerp, Tel Aviv and London as a leading diamond processingcenter, a business in which bin Laden later became heavily invested.GOING GLOBALAl-Qaeda’s financial network was not limited to the Islamic world. The August25, 2002 Sunday Express reported that al-Qaeda financial front men associatedwith the Islamic charity, Mercy International Relief Agency, had used Irish bankaccounts to transfer money to Warsaw, Poland.36 According to the officialversion of events, Tim Shipman, writing for the Sunday Express, stated, “Some ofthe fund transfers, picked up by National Security Agency and British GovernmentCommunications Headquarters (GCHQ) intercepts, were likely used to fund part ofthe 9/11 attacks.”37An article in the Moscow Times on September 4, 2002, not only confirmed thesefindings, but also added a few precious nuggets of its own. “Victor Bout’splanes have been used to fly al-Qaeda and Taliban gold to Sudan in recent weeks.Several shipments of gold were delivered by boat from Karachi, Pakistan, toeither Iran or the United Arab Emirates,” said the newspaper citing unidentifiedEuropean intelligence officials. The report continued: “From there, the gold wasflown on charted planes to the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, where al-Qaeda hasbroad business contacts.” Air Bas, one of Victor Bout’s flagship airlines,supposedly transported the gold.“Not true,” said Bout. “I have never had business dealings with the Taliban oral-Qaeda.” I checked the primary source. As I suspected, it wasn’t the MoscowTimes. The information came via Douglas Farah in the Washington Post.38 Iscanned the article for precise information. “Financial officers of al-Qaeda andthe Taliban have quietly shipped large quantities of gold out of Pakistan toSudan in recent weeks, transiting through the United Arab Emirates and Iran,according to European, Pakistani and US investigators.” Once again, thoseeverhandy “European, Pakistani, and US investigators.”I skipped a paragraph. “Although it is not clear how much gold has been moved,US and European officials said the quantity was significant.” Are these the sameofficials who claim to have irrefutable evidence against Bout’s transgressionsonly to show up in Belgian and Thai courts empty handed, claiming theirrefutable evidence to be locked up in the DEA secure facility in New York?Thai courts didn’t buy it, neither did the Belgian justice system. Why shouldwe?Michael Chandler, a retired British colonel who led a UN panel on the Talibanand al-Qaeda, is quoted in Moisés Naírn’s book, Illicit: How Smugglers,Traffickers and Copycats are Hijacking the Global Economy: “If you look at allthe escapades of Bout and his associates, how easy it was for them to moveweapons, get end-user certificates, and change aircraft registration, you get anamazing picture of how corrupt many parts of the world are.”In their book, Farah and Braun excused US lack of early action against Bout:“The notion [in the 1990s] that transnational threats – the Clintonadministration’s phrasing for terrorists, narcotics cartels, global organizedcrime, and other dangerous ‘non-state actors’ – might prove as dangerous ashostile nations was an idea still in its infancy.”39 That much I could buy.However, what I was unwilling to buy was the notion that for over a decade, aVictor Bout remained a step ahead of the supposedly helpless United Statesgovernment, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, Interpol and their hundred-billion-dollarbudgets, with Total Information Awareness and Echelon’s global spy system. Oneman against the world.“Why are we subtly being led down this path?” I kept asking myself. “Could theBouts and the bin Ladens simply serve as extensions of someone else’s hiddenagenda, were they part of the Shadow World where the Men behind the Curtainoperate?” The question made sense. If the answer to the question is a “yes,” asit surely is in CIA-trained Osama bin Laden’s case, then the world we live in isindeed a cesspool of duplicity and lies and double-speak and secret governmentagendas, of changing loyalties, brainwashed black-ops agents, rogue dictatorsand telegenic villains who act as extensions of someone’s foreign policy.When the UN made its April 2001 report on the Democratic Republic of theCongo,40 it cited how easy it was for Bout to run his operation from Burundi.Sounds great, except Bout’s business was never registered in Burundi, accordingto the Ministry of Transportation’s Database Records located in Bujumbura.Furthermore, I went online and with the help of GP Fleet’s tracking and tracingfleet management technology, I double-checked Bout’s business practices inBurundi. Nothing. Either Burundi and/or Bout deliberately erased all traces ofhis unwholesome business practices in the country or … the UN was outrightlying.According to a January 2005 report of the UN Security Council, “Burundi has inthe past served as a ‘flag of convenience’ for operators in the DemocraticRepublic of the Congo by issuing aircraft registrations for their planes andlicenses for foreign pilots.”The term “flag of convenience” refers to aircraft registration in lessscrupulous countries that allow circumvention of international regulations onair cargo. Many fly from airports like Burgas in Bulgaria, Ostend in Belgium andSharjah in the UAE. These airports are known for their “lax oversight ofairfreight operations.” Additionally, airfreight documents do not requirecross-referencing of the goods described in the arms export and import licenses.Arms shipments are often described as engineering, mining, agricultural orhospital equipment.41 One of the oddities of the freight business is that youare not required to specify the travel route, nor any possible subcontractors,nor the ultimate customer. In fact, it is not even necessary for an airplane tobe physically present in a country in order for it to be registered there. Nowonder outlaw Liberia is one of the behemoths of the business.Once again, the message coming from the United Nations was crystal clear. It wasnot too difficult for someone like Victor Bout, with his shadowy connections,who excelled at getting around international rules and regulations, to gounnoticed and be one step ahead of the UN investigators and governments alike inchanging aircraft registration from one country to another, and then another.I checked the April 2001 report on the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Theindividual I was most interested in was Johan Peleman, listed as a technicaladviser in Point 3. In fact, every damning UN report on Bout had Peleman as oneof the authors. And only UN reports that involved Peleman incriminated Bout as aslippery, notorious arms-runner.I called him, after an initial exchange of pleasantries and emails.“Johan, this is Daniel Estulin. We spoke several days ago. You must feel goodabout Bout being finally in prison.”He sighed. It was a prolonged sigh of a man who carried the weight of thegodless world on his wide shoulders.“Johan, I know you are busy, so I will get right to the point. How much moneydid you personally make from being Bout’s leading antagonist?”There was a pause. It sounded like Peleman held his breath, and then he said, “Iworked for the United Nations.”“Are you saying you worked for free? If yes, what did you live on? I mean, whatis the source of your income?”Another pause. “I was getting a salary for my work.”“Johan, in a Groot Bijgaarden De Standaard newspaper interview, you said thatthe operational budget of the UN panel on Liberia amounted to 1 million Eurosand that you would never be given the same freedom of movement as you wereenjoying whilst working on the report. You also said you went to Africa thirtytimes that year.”“It proves that illegal arms trafficking was not a top priority for the BelgianGovernment,” he interrupted me.“It also proves you had access to a fabulous trough of cash. You have donenumerous reports for the UN and have been working with them for years. How muchmoney did you make in the name of putting the bad guys behind bars?”“You are dealing with—”“Two million dollars,” I interrupted him. “Three, four, five?”“This guy is the worst offender—”“Six? Seven, Ten? Eleven million dollars? Ten years of going after Bout, Johan.How much money?“Bout deserves to be where he—”“Thirteen? Fifteen? Twenty?”“I wasn’t alone. We had staff, people working for us, researchers,investigators, secretaries.”I was madly scribbling it all down. “Twenty million dollars, Johan! That’s a lotof money for staff and expenses. What kind of an operation did you people run atthe United Nations?”“You have any idea what it takes to track down someone like Bout?”“I am beginning to,” I shot back. “By the way, do you have Bout’s story optionedto Hollywood as well?” No response.“One last question, Johan. In your April 2001 Congo report you mention Boutdoing business out of Burundi. I checked every available registry and guesswhat? Nothing. Can you —”“I don’t have time for this,” he cut me off. “If you want to see the real story,go to BBC and watch their report.” He hung up.I turned to the BBC page, found their BBC World Report on Victor Bout andpressed play.Some three minutes into it, Peleman’s name came up along with the UN report onAngola dated December 18, 2000. According to the BBC report, “the name Boutbecame known to the general public in late January 2001.” Then, Peleman’s faceappeared, cigarette in hand. “It was the first time Bout was mentioned in anofficial report as being a sanctions buster. What was different was that thisreport was sexy enough to be picked up by the media.” I bolted up in my chair.Come again? I was sure I misunderstood. I rewound the video and listened again.Yes, Peleman said “it was sexy enough.” How do you sex up a report? Well,actually, we know how. The Bush administration and the British did it as part ofthe campaign to scare the public into rubberstamping their illegal war in Iraq.Published by the British government on September 24, 2002, the September Dossierwas part of a campaign by the Blair administration to bolster support for the2003 Iraq invasion. It contained a number of later-proven-baseless allegations,according to which Iraq possessed WMDs, including chemical and biologicalweapons. A sexed up report, which lead to a human carnage in Iraq.HUNTING VICTOR BOUTAccording to the August 17, 2003 issue of the New York Times Magazine, duringthe final year of the Clinton administration, US intelligence began trackingBout’s activities and his network, which included the likes of Ruprah andLakhani. In the summer of 1999, faced with multiple conflicts in West andCentral Africa, the National Security Council authorized electronic surveillanceof government and militia leaders in war zones like northeast Congo, Liberia andSierra Leone. Every morning, NSC officials cross-referenced transcripts ofoverheard telephone conversations with American satellite imagery and with fieldreports by British spies on the ground. The documentation was massive, withoutobvious patterns, until, finally, astute analysts noticed that every conflicthad something in common: Victor Bout. Belgium already had an internationalarrest warrant out for Bout for money laundering and diamond smuggling.Clinton’s National Security Council believed Bout was aiding terrorism.Landesman writes in the New York Times Magazine:Gayle Smith, the National Security Council’s (NSC) top Africanist, whose staffuncovered the Bout connection, sent an e-mail message to her fellow NSC members:“Who is this guy? Pay close attention to this. He’s all over the place.”An answer was provided by a CIA aviation expert from Langley, who showed up atthe White House with covert photographs shot at various African jungle airstripsbetween 1996 and 1999. The photos, according to a former White House officialwho studied them, show different Antonovs and Ilyushins, Russian cargo planesbuilt to land on (and escape from) almost any surface. In the pictures, theplanes’ bellies are open. African militiamen in fatigues are offloading cratesof weapons. One photo shows a younger Bout standing before one of the planes.The White House official said the planes were traced to Bout.42At least on paper, it looked as if America was prepared to act. Smith and otherstook their information to Richard C. Clarke, then the chief of counterterrorismfor the NSC. “Get me a warrant,” Clarke responded, but US laws could not extendto Bout’s foreign arms deliveries.43Clarke, of course, would have known this; then why the charade? Was this anothercase of powerful people playing games with us, dancing between raindropsperfectly content to hold our lives in the balance? What further complicated theissue was that the United Nations has no law enforcement powers: itsinvestigators cannot subpoena, detain or arrest suspects. “Big arms are theprovince of individual countries, but no country is configured to deal with itbecause its jurisdiction stops at the border,” said Jonathan M. Winer, deputyassistant secretary of state for international law enforcement in the Clintonadministration.In addition to efforts of American intelligence, we were led to believe, “Bout’sclandestine activities in Africa were shadowed by the British MI6 on theground,”44 Interpol and United Nations inspectors. US and British intelligencehad eavesdropped on his telephone conversations. Interpol had issued a “rednotice,” requesting his arrest on Belgian weapons-trafficking andmoney-laundering charges.Arms dealer Victor Bout, the Merchant of Death, allegedly the largest knownillicit trafficker, sought by the International Community for feeding conflictsthroughout much of the Eastern Hemisphere – was being squeezed, methodically …until George W. Bush came into office and Iraq “happened.”Then Bout was supposedly working for the Pentagon, and apparently had permissionto fly into Iraq. I needed definitive proof, but at this point in myinvestigation, I was overwhelmed with research and underwhelmed with help.What’s more, I wasn’t about to take the media reports at face value. But theproof would have to wait. For now, I used open sources and mainstream pressreports.The storyline out of the corporate media camp was clean and simple to follow.Bout’s Texas-based Air Bas had rights to refuel at US bases in Iraq. One ofBout’s other airfreight companies, Airbus, was subcontracted through anotherfirm called Falcon Express of Dubai, by Kellogg Brown and Root, then asubsidiary of Halliburton.45 Before acquiring his fiefdom at the US NavalObservatory, former Vice President Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton.I checked my Iraq timeline. Spring 2004 “roughly coincided with the early andstill-disorganized stages of the Iraqi resistance. Utterly unprepared, coalitionforces found themselves in a massive logistics crunch.”46 Bush, Cheney, DonaldRumsfeld and Richard Perle had promised a cakewalk, and told the world thatgrateful Iraqi people would greet American soldiers “with flowers and music.”They had lied.Road transit became a living nightmare. American SUVs were picked off like fliesby the insurgency. Someone thought of a Plan B to get supplies and ammunition tothe troops. According to one contractor in Iraq working for Dyncorp, thePentagon began leasing aircraft from just about anyone who had them, whilesimultaneously outsourcing convoy duty to private security firms in order tolimit the exposure of American troops.At least one company tied to Bout’s network was hired by the Bush administrationfor the war effort in Iraq, reported Michael Scherer on September 20, 2004.“Records obtained by Mother Jones show that, as recently as August, Air Bas, acompany tied to Bout and his associates, was flying charter missions undercontract with the US military in Iraq. Air Bas is overseen by Victor Bout’sbrother, Serguei, and his business manager, Richard Chichakli, an accountantliving in Texas; in the past, payments for Air Bas have gone to a Kazakh companythat the United Nations identifies as ‘a front for the leasing operations ofVictor Bout’s aircraft.’”47Mother Jones was being rather sparing with its information.48 Chichakli, infact, was more than a mere accountant. According to some sources he was anex-CIA operative and a relative of the former president of Syria, AdibShishakli, who after resigning the office of president in February 1954 lived inexile in Brazil, where he was assassinated in the town of Ceres on September 27,1964.Richard Chichakli became close to the bin Laden family while studying in SaudiArabia between 1977 and 1986. Mohamed bin Laden, the patriarch of the family,had 52 children by a number of wives, and two of his wives were Syrian. Themother of Osama bin Laden is a Syrian, and the mother of Saad bin Laden, ahalf-brother to Osama whom Chichakli had met in Riyadh University, was alsoSyrian.Saad bin Laden introduced Chichakli to the rest of the bin Laden family afterthe two of them became close friends, a relationship which was enhanced by theirSyrian family background. All of that led to Chichakli getting liked and trustedby the mother, and subsequently by the other members of the family, includingSalem bin Laden.Chichakli alleges that Salem bin Laden was ordered killed by George H.W. Bush in1988 in order to protect his son George W. Bush, who had been stealing moneyfrom bin Laden funds in the United States. At the time, the fund was under themanagement of “Major” James Bath, a former National Guard major who had servedwith Dubbya and was the financier of the latter’s oil-drilling ventures.Contrary to what has been written on the subject, Chichakli maintains, Salem wasnot killed in an ultra-light airplane that hit power lines in Texas; he wasassassinated over the Mediterranean while headed to the US to revoke Bath’spower as trustee over the bin Laden monies, when his BAC 1-11 aircraft was shotdown over international waters by the Israeli air force at the order of YitzhakRabin, then Minister of Defense. But, I am getting away from my story.Douglas Farah has claimed that Chichakli used to sit around and eat sandwichesand sing songs with bin Laden and his siblings, back when Osama was OK.I sent Chichakli an email.I have some points that I need to clarify. Unfortunately, certain parts of youraudio recording weren’t very good.1. Your relationship to the former president of Syria, Adib Shishakli.2. Your relationship to the bin Ladens. There are several references inmainstream sources essentially stating the following: you “hung out with ayouthful Osama and ran a free-trade zone in the United Arab Emirates.”3. Your relationship to Miles Copeland.4. Were you working for the US intelligence, as has been suggested?“I do not know Osama bin Ladin nor I have met him, he lived in Jeddah and wentto School in King Abdul Aziz University there, while I was in Riyadh and went touniversity in Riyadh, emailed Chichakli. “The ‘hang out story’ is a made uptale.” He did acknowledged that Saad bin Laden had been present at his weddingon July 14, 1983.I checked the original source for Osama bin Laden and Chichakli hanging outtogether. Douglas Farah, Merchant of Death, pages 53-56. Someone was obviously“wrong.” But who?Why would Chichakli make up a story of hanging out with the terrorist wanted formasterminding 9/11? Not a good way to make friends and influence people. On theother hand, if you are Farah and you are creating a background, “setting thescene” so to speak, linking Chichakli and Osama bin Laden and later Chichakliand Victor Bout would be ideal for negatively influencing people’s opinions. Isthis another case of multiple passports, walled compounds and phantom fleets allmade to serve someone’s far-reaching policy objectives?Chichakli refused to comment on his relationship with US intelligence officerMiles Copeland, a key player in US intelligence operations in the Middle East, aveteran of Wild Bill Donovan’s wartime OSS, and a founding father of the CIA. Ihave been told by reliable sources that Chichakli was a close confidant of MilesCopeland.On point one, he is related, though not immediate family, to former Syrianpresident Shishakli. Thus, a Victor Bout “accountant” was closely linked to theCIA, to the bin Ladens and to a former president of Syria. Of course, MotherJones would have known at least some of it, had they dug a little deeper. Ittook me less than one hour to cross reference some of this information throughseveral popular search engines, and a couple of emails to Richard Chichaklihimself. Why, then, didn’t they?Was Chichakli being protected as someone’s foreign policy asset through apublication that claims to be a non-profit “Foundation for National Progress”?In 1997, Mother Jones was given a $3 million grant by the Alfred P. SloanFoundation “to establish a Center for Working Families” at the University ofBerkeley. The Sloan Foundation’s board of trustees includes former chairmen ofthe General Motors, J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley corporate boards.If Chichakli was being protected or being used as someone’s foreign policyasset, I thought, the corollary was clear: so was Victor Bout. Taking it onestep further, if Bout’s actions were part of the plan, then the entire elaborateconstruct of smoke and mirrors could become visible as we followed itsimplications into a parallel world beyond logic.“Why are you doing this?” asked my aunt, shortly before she died, the aunt whohad clucked over the “terrible things” done to our family.Because universal corruption and abuse of power and privileges at the deepestlevel of society must be exposed, even at the risk of one’s life. And becausethe notion of the Shadow Masters acting as our puppeteers is too unpalatable,too intolerable.Perhaps the best response to my aunt’s question is another. What are the moralconsequences of freedom?BOUT-TALIBAN LINKBy Douglas Farah’s account, Victor Bout’s alleged dealings with the Taliban andal-Qaeda “were the subject of an ongoing, classified US operation that began inearly 2000.” Aware of the lack of international instruments to prosecute Bout,the United States embarked on a campaign against him. “There was a concertedeffort at the tail end of the Clinton administration, continued into the Bushadministration, to put him out of business,” Farah reported, citing anotherphantom former US government official “working out of the State Department.”49Hoping against hope for something concrete, I checked the article for names ofreal people. Nothing. It was the familiar Farah sleight of hand.Of course, any investigator might check for himself. How many such officialscould there be in the given time frame, you might ask? Try thousands.The intelligence community claims to have known for a long time of Bout’sextensive ties to Afghanistan. For example, according to a 1998 Belgianintelligence report, one of Bout’s Boeing 707s with a crew from Switzerland andregistered in the Democratic Republic of the Congo was “partially financed byAfghan generals.”50 Unlike his relationships with other Afghan forces, Bout’ssupposed links to the Taliban have been mostly unknown, even within therank-and-file of international intelligence communities. According to DouglasFarah, they go back to August 1995, when the Taliban was in opposition toPresident Burhanuddin Rabbani’s government in Kabul.51In reference to Bout’s supposed link to the Taliban, a PBS documentary ongunrunners stated that Taliban officials impounded “30-odd tons of AK-47 smallarms ammunition” meant for government forces in Kabul. At the time, the Talibanhad captured ten provincial capitals, but had not yet taken Kabul, and littlemore was heard about the event until after 9/11.52On January 1, 2002, the Washington Monthly shed additional light on supposedBout-Taliban connections, saying that an apolitical Bout started selling to theTaliban while negotiating for the release of his plane and Russian crew in 1995.“When his plane was detained, he used the opportunity as a business introductionto the Taliban.”53 The Center for Public Integrity website also reported, “Bout,together with Russian diplomats, met Mullah Omar and other Taliban leaders tonegotiate the release of the detained crew in Kandahar, but they were notsuccessful.”54Bout doesn’t deny meeting Omar, quite the opposite. “Of course I met with him.This was my crew. I was responsible for them. But selling arms to the Taliban?Never.” According to Bout, Mullah Omar was simply awful. A leader without ideas.Do I simply take Bout at his word? Of course not. But he may well have beentelling the simple truth. I noted a grumble of resentment in Bout’s voice, andnary a trace of dissembling or guile. It sounded like the truth to me.“What side are you on?” I have been asked repeatedly throughout myinvestigation.I am on my side, gentlemen, and I represent those who have no voice. If anyoneis apolitical, I am. Not amoral, but apolitical.Bout’s denials of his Taliban dealings are all lies, if we are to believe the“UN and US government officials.” They apparently said Bout made a deal with theTaliban in 1996 in the UAE, one of only three countries in the world, along withPakistan and Saudi Arabia, which recognized the regime. “Starting in 1998,according to aircraft registration documents found in Kabul by Afghan officials,Bout’s operation based in Sharjah sold the Taliban military a fleet of cargoplanes that was used to haul tons of arms and materiel into Afghanistan.”55 Whomade this statement? Douglas Farah.Off went another email to Douglas Farah:How many planes did Bout sell to the Taliban? The reason I ask is that theoperation doesn’t make sense. If Bout is a transporter, then his business isbuying, not selling, planes to maximize profit through operations, unless theplanes he sold were clunkers. In which case, why would the Taliban buy them inthe first place? Also, I am somewhat uncomfortable with the following phrase:“Starting in 1998, according to aircraft registration documents found in Kabulby Afghan officials.” It sounds too convenient. So, would it be too much to askfor you to explain, who were these officials, or in the absence of thisinformation whom did they work for and how is it that a man of Bout’s supposedtalents for invisibility would leave incriminating documents to be found byAfghani officials who luckily for you, told you about them?”In an email of September 29, 2009, Farah simply replied that it was “all in thebook.” No, I was asking precisely because it is not in the book.Of course, really replying to nosy independent investigators may not be in theinterests of someone’s farsighted agenda.But, there was more to the campaign against Bout.On January 7, 2002, the German weekly, Der Spiegel, claimed that Bout helpedarrange the sale of up to 200 Russian T-55 and T-62 tanks to the Taliban. Thetanks were alleged to have been transported by one of Bout’s airfreightcompanies. Reportedly, undercover Russian SVR (intelligence) agents in Kabuldiscovered that Pakistan’s Inter Service Intelligence (ISI) agency was also inon the arms-smuggling deal, a violation of UN sanctions against the Taliban.56The primary source on this information apparently was Stephen Braun, DouglasFarah’s co-author on Merchant of Death.As of this writing, NATO forces arguably control much of Afghanistan, and whatisn’t directly controlled is subject to constant surveillance by the mostsophisticated detection systems known. Yet the tanks are nowhere to be found.Are they all in some Taliban caves? Or is this another case of missing WMDs?Have anyone tried calling Afghanistan’s lost and found department? The seriousaccusations against Bout and his 200 tanks have lost all credibility, but thisfact has been quietly swept under the rug.According to intelligence sources in Ministry of Foreign Affairs RussianPresident Putin, in late February or early March 2002, reported to the WhiteHouse that ISI agents known to Russian intelligence were connected to arms ringssupplying not only the Taliban but also an offshoot of both the Chechen andal-Qaeda cells. President Bush promised to send an FBI team to St. Petersburg tofurther investigate, but that turned out to be an empty promise. The Russianintelligence was buttressed independently in August 2000, when a purchase orderfound during Leonid Minin’s arrest in Italy showed that ISI ran guns for theTaliban, without any apparent help from Bout.JUST ANOTHER V.P.On December 14, 2004, the Los Angeles Times opened its morning edition with astartling story: “Air cargo companies allegedly tied to reputed Russian armstrafficker Victor Bout have received millions of dollars in federal funds fromUS contractors in Iraq, even though the Bush administration has worked for threeyears to rein in his enterprise.”57The story continued with the Times reporters throwing one firebomb afteranother. “Planes linked to Victor Bout’s shadowy network continued to fly intoIraq, according to government records and interviews with officials, even thoughthe Treasury Department froze his assets in July [2004] and placed him on ablacklist for allegedly violating international arms sanctions. Largely underthe auspices of the Pentagon, US agencies including the Army Corps of Engineersand the Air Force, and the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority, whichgoverned Iraq until last summer, have allowed their private contractors to dobusiness with the Bout network [emphasis added]. Four firms linked to thenetwork by the CIA and international investigators have flown into Iraqapproximately 195 times on US business, government flight and fuel documentsshow. One such flight landed in Baghdad last week. The list of the Boutnetwork’s suspected clients over the years includes the Taliban, which boughtairplanes for a secret airlift of arms to Afghanistan. The Taliban was known tohave shared weapons with al-Qaeda.”58Initially, no other US mainstream corporate media came within shouting distanceof this story with the exception of a veteran journalist, Mike Isikoff, ofNewsweek. And he added one additional item: “The exact number of flightsBout-connected firms made into Iraq, 142 … were contracted by Halliburton’ssubsidiary Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR).”59 As reviewers of the war-zonecontracting have noted, Halliburton was then an oil-services company “that alsoprovides construction and military support services – a triple-header of wartimespoils.”60 “Wartime spoils” have immensely profited the corporation that VicePresident Cheney had headed.According to the Center for Public Integrity, the Cheney-Halliburton story isthe classic military-industrial revolving door tale. As Secretary of Defenseunder Bush’s father, Dick Cheney paid Brown & Root services (later Kellogg Brown& Root, now KBR, Inc.) $3.9 million to report on how private companies couldhelp the US Army, as Cheney cut hundreds of thousands of Army jobs. Then Brown &Root won a five-year contract to provide logistics for the US Army Corp ofEngineers all over the globe. In 1995 Cheney became CEO, and Halliburton jumpedfrom 73rd to 18th on the Pentagon’s list of top contractors, benefiting from atleast $3.8 billion in federal contracts and taxpayer-insured loans.61According to the aforementioned Los Angeles Times article, “UN investigationsand American officials have linked Air Bas, incorporated in Texas but based inthe United Arab Emirates, and Irbis, a company registered in Kazakhstan, toBout’s aviation empire.” Before 2001, Air Bas was called Air Cess.62When I was digging for evidence, I came across several pages of documents fromintelligence files that indicated one of the Boutlinked firms was drawing fuelfrom the Army as of March 10, 2004, and another as of April 5, 2004. Bout,again, I thought to myself, refueling at American bases? Through a captain inthe US Army’s special security unit stationed in Iraq who has followed myinvestigations for years, I was finally able to secure a copy of the fuelpurchasing agreements with Air Bas, one of … Richard Chichakli’s companies!What the Hell is going on? I thought. Chichakli? Air Bas is Bout’s company. Itis Bout, not Chichakli. Everyone from the United Nations to Newsweek, the NewYork Times, Washington Times to Le Monde63 insisted on linking Bout’s Air Basactivity in Iraq to US government lack of oversight regarding contracts afterthe Merchant of Death’s assets had been frozen.Douglas Farah made the Bout-Air Bas connection very clear in his WashingtonPost, September 23, 2007 article.64 Merchant of Death coauthor, Stephen Braun’sAugust 13, 2007 Washington Post article clearly stated that “Bout’s planes wereused as what former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz described assecond-tier contractors. The Army or the Army Corps of Engineers would hire KBRor other prime contractors to fly in supplies, and the firms would then hireBout planes, either directly or through air charter services.”This too, was apparently a lie. Bout didn’t fly anything for the United Statesgovernment! Chichakli did. I held the agreement in my hand, signed on March 9,2004. There was no doubt about it, Air Bas belonged to Chichakli. Then why, didthe United Nations insist on freezing Air Bas assets as belonging to Bout? Tomuddy the waters further, several weeks later, I acquired Air Bas Jet Fuelidentification card issued to the company by the Department of Defense of theUnited States.The Center for Public Integrity, part of the International Consortium ofInvestigative Journalists, is a non-profit organization based in Washington, DC.Its work is generally considered authoritative, and I have cited their reportingon the meeting between Bout and Taliban leaders regarding his downed aircraftand crew. They stated categorically that “Air Cess, just like Air Bas, existsmostly on paper, but it has given Victor Bout the right to use the “N” numbergiven to planes registered in North America, a vital advantage, especially whenyou fly illegal cargo and contraband” [emphasis added].65I Googled for their website, quickly found what I was looking for, clicked onthe supporting documents section and waited. I became particularly interested inthe extensive Leonid Minin documentation they claimed to have accessed, sincemultiple corporate media reports claimed that Minin and Bout were partners intheir arms-for-drugs-for-diamonds trade. To my chagrin, all Minin documents hadbeen taken offline. I picked up the phone.“What happened to the Minin archive in the documents section of your webpage?” Iasked.“Well, you see, we … we had to take it down.”“Why?”“Ah, we didn’t have permission from the authorities.”“Which authorities?” I insisted.“I don’t know. You should speak to Alain Lallemand.”“OK. Can I speak to him?”“Well, he is not here. But I can give you a number to call.”“I wanted to ask you about Victor Bout. I am working on a deadline, and unless Ihand in my manuscript in the next few weeks, my publisher may do unseemly bodilyharm to me.”She laughed.So did I. The mood had been set. It was time to sink the line.“What’s so special about Bout’s passports?” I asked.“He has two of them,” came the reply.“Yes?” I asked expectantly.There was a pause. Then I continued. “If you look closely, one was issued in1998 and the other in the year 2000,” I said.“Why would he change his passports so often?”“Perhaps because he travels a lot,” I quipped, “and ran out of blank pages forstamps.”“Or perhaps, he doesn’t want to be caught,” she replied significantly.“With what?”“You know what I mean,” she answered.“No, actually, I don’t. Let me ask you another question. Under the subheadingBout Arms Transactions 1996-1998, there is a flow chart.”“That’s Bout’s operation,” she clarified.“How do you know this,” I asked somewhat puzzled.“It’s from the UN report.”“Do you know who wrote the report?” I inquired.“Johan Peleman,” she said triumphantly.“And the flow chart of Bout’s operating network is from the same report?”“Exactly.”Before saying goodbye, I had to know one more thing. “Have you actually seen theevidence purported to show the extent of Bout’s arms smuggling network?”“No,” she said. “Just the flow chart.”A few minutes later, I called and left a message for Alain Lallemand. That wasmany weeks before press time, and I doubt the man intends to get back to me. Yousee, the Belgian courts found a great part of Minin’s documents to be fakes. Iam sure that’s why they were taken down. It had made someone important look badand exposed their lies, and perhaps their true intentions. Someone was liningducks up for a kill. I could smell it. In this business, one’s nostrils neverquite adjust. Instead, they develop a kind of hypersensitivity – to theinnumerable variations of the basic rotten smell.It was the sequence of events that concerned me.Zero, one, one, two, three, five, eight, thirteen, twenty-one, thirty-four, andso on. That is the Fibonacci sequence. Anyone might look and not see a pattern,but it is right there and staring one in the face (every third numeral is thesum of the previous two). I needed to see how each event was connected to theone before it. I pulled up everything I could on Bout, including the timelinesof the corporate news stories on him, UN reports, government actions andannouncements, not to mention an extensive file I had compiled on Internettraffic regarding Bout and the sites that most covered him. Who said what abouthim and when? What did a major announcement on Bout coincide with? That willgive me the sequence, the pattern, that makes order out of chaos, I thought tomyself.“Fibonacci sequence?” asked a friend, dumbfounded. “Have you been reading DanBrown?”“True sequences don’t change. Neither do the patterns of human thought. I justneed to find it,” I replied, absolutely sure I had walked through looking glassinto a parallel universe of smoke and mirrors, but one where the actual outlineswere still discernible.Aside from his numerous qualifications for phantom journalism, Douglas Farah isa very intelligent man. He is closely associated with the Council on ForeignRelations, the US arm of the powerful and secretive Bilderberg Group, and theHudson Institute, a neocon hotbed. The CFR boasts a membership of about 4,000.But its roster includes literally hundreds of powerful figures occupying keypositions in the media – not merely writers, reporters, and news anchors whodeliver the news, but also editors, publishers, and executives who define whatnews is and how it is covered. Just as significantly, the tiny CFR clique hasfor decades had a virtual stranglehold on the executive branch of the USgovernment, as well as much of academia.In his October 30, 1993 “Ruling Class Journalists” essay, Washington Postombudsman Richard Harwood candidly discussed how the CFR dominates our newsmedia. Harwood described the Council on Foreign Relations as “the closest thingwe have to a ruling Establishment in the United States … Its members are thepeople who, for more than half a century, have managed our international affairsand our military-industrial complex.” After listing the executive-branchpositions then occupied by CFR members, Harwood continued: “What isdistinctively modern about the council these days is the considerableinvolvement of journalists and other media figures, who account for more than 10percent of the membership.“The editorial page editor, deputy editorial page editor, executive editor,managing editor, foreign editor, national affairs editor, business and financialeditor and various writers as well as [the now deceased] Katherine Graham, thepaper’s principal owner, represent the Washington Post in the council’smembership,” observed Harwood. He went on to describe CFR representation amongthe owners, management, and editorial personnel for the other media giants – theNew York Times, Wall Street Journal, Los Angeles Times, NBC, CBS, ABC, and soon. These media heavyweights “do not merely analyze and interpret foreign policyfor the United States; they help make it,” he concluded. Rather than offering anindependent perspective on our rulers’ actions, the Establishment media act asthe ruling elite’s voice – conditioning the public to accept, and even embrace“insider” designs that otherwise might not be politically attainable.Back in 2003, when Douglas Farah was coming into his own, the Hudson Institutewas heavily financed by Lord Conrad Black, the now disgraced former owner of theHollinger Corporation. The Hudson Institute “has done more to shape the wayAmericans react to political and social events, think, vote and generallyconduct themselves than perhaps any except the kingpin of the brainwashingestablishment – Tavistock Institute of Human Relations itself.”66 Hudsonprimarily specializes in defense policy research and relations with Russia.Might Victor Bout fall under this specialized category? Of course.Furthermore, “most of Hudson’s military work is classified as secret. One of itslargest clients is the US Department of Defense which includes matters of civildefense, national security, military policy and arms control.”67 In themainstream media, Hudson and the CFR are usually portrayed as having oppositeviewpoints. However, they serve the same interests, and Farah’s job seems to beto lecture, travel, and issue reports on Victor Bout, Islam, Islamic terrorism,aviation, arms trafficking, diamonds, African politics, and whatever is hot inthe media in such a way as to manipulate public opinion favorably to cartelinterests.But another apparent piece of the puzzle fell into place when I found a 2003 UNSecurity Council report on several violations of the arms embargo, first inSomalia implicating Air Bas in Bout’s aviation empire, and then in Rwanda whereAir Bas was accused of supplying Hutu extremists with arms for carrying out theRwanda genocide.Just when I thought I had stumbled onto one of Bout’s transgressions, I drewanother blank. The UN Security Council report was referring to Air Bass FZE ofSharjah, an entity utterly unrelated to Bout’s empire. How do I know this? Thetwo companies incorporation documents. That didn’t stop Office of Foreign AssetsControl to add Victor Bout and his onetime accountant Richard Chichakli to itsSpecially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) list,68 citing theaforementioned UN report as evidence. In the BBC-4 World Report special onVictor Bout, the host interviewed Adam Szubin, the head of the US Treasury’sOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).Voice over: “Finally, OFAC decided to put a bullet straight through Bout’swallet. In 2005, his company assets were frozen and put off limit to others.”Szubin: “If Mr. Bout had assets in the United States, they would have beenimmediately frozen.”Did I hear right, did the OFAC man just contradict the BBC? Did Bout have assetsin the United States or didn’t he?“I never did any business in the United States,” Bout told me. “I haveprinciples.” OFAC agrees, at least on the first point. Bout, to their chagrin,never did business in America. Here was a real but (not as in Victor But, but asin a simple, to the contrary, English “but”).BBC program host: “How much money did you find, roughly?”Szubin: “A close conspirator of his assesses that he lost in the region of sixbillion dollars in profit due to pressure that was put on him thanks tosanctions.”Six billion dollars? In profit?A good story. Yes, definitely a good story. True? No, most definitely not true,although it makes for compelling television. There is no arms surplus availablefor illegal trading in the entire world that comes close to even 10% of thisnumber. How can my assertions be verified? A Thai court identified a US claimabout the hundreds of surface-to-air missiles that Bout supposedly agreed tosell to the FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) as “lacking foundationand credibility.” The excerpt from the Thai Court of First Instance verdict(page 48), as somehow translated from Thai into Russian and then back intoEnglish, is as follows: “… the accused was charged with selling the largequantity of war weapons and fighter aircrafts which have the large quantity andthe price is too high to believe that it can be illegally traded. It [the Court]is in doubt where to find the illegal source of large quantity of war weapons …[emphasis added].”For example, it took nine years to officially deliver $20 billion worth of armsin the Al-Yamamah deal between the UK’s BAE systems and the Saudi Arabiangovernment, the largest arms deal ever contracted. If Szubin’s assertion is tobe taken at face value and the US indeed denied Bout $6 billion in profit, howmuch should he have sold in arms to make such a profit, and how on earth cansuch a quantity of arms be moved without anyone taking notice?Furthermore, UN investigators examining bank records in the United Arab Emiratesin 2001, a known terrorist money-laundering center, claimed they “found frequentmoney transfers between British Gulf and another Bout-linked company, San AirGeneral Trading.”69 This article appeared in the Los Angeles Times in lateDecember 2004. Among its authors is Stephen Braun, Douglas Farah’s coauthor onthe Merchant of Death.It took a little digging, but in the end, this too proved to be utterlybaseless. Off went an email to Stephen Braun.Hey Stephen.My name is Daniel Estulin. I am working on a very tight deadline re. VictorBout. I would like to clarify a point and would love to have your cooperation.In your LAT article you write that investigators found frequent money transfersbetween various Bout companies. Specifically, “payments for many of the weaponsthat went to Liberia through Victor Bout’s network in 2000 and 2001 weredirected to San Air’s bank accounts.” That’s not what I found. Can you get backto me ASAP?Did he? Of course not.San Air USA was created in 2000 for Victor Bout in the US by Richard Chichakli.Apparently the plan was to manufacture panels for Russian aircraft, whichbusiness would provide a basis for Bout and family to establish a residence inthe US. After Bout’s application in Dubai for a US visa was rejected, theproject died, and Chichakli dissolved the firm after a couple of years. OnlyChichakli’s name appears on the company documents, and it never did any businessbeyond maintaining a small banking account in Richardson, Texas.San Air UAE, a completely different company, to which account an alleged paymentfrom the Liberian Maritime located in the US was made, was founded by AndreiSemenchenko who has been locked up in a United Arab Emirates jail for the pasteight years.70 In fact, UAE-based San Air would have been “Sun Air” except for atypo in the incorporation documents, which turned it into San Air. The nameremained unaltered on the books because Semenchenko did not have the money tocorrect the incorporation document.Did Stephen Braun know this? If I found out, working on a limited budget, socould he. Furthermore, The US treasury’s OFAC used the exact language stated ina UN resolution about Liberia to credit their action against Bout’s 30companies, as per UN reports S/2006/976 and S/2007/340. Is it the case of onehand washing the other? Another example of converging interests of the Menbehind the Curtain?In fact, as I discovered, none of the assets frozen by OFAC belonged to VictorBout, but rather to Richard Chichakli. I have in my possession every financialtransaction that took place through the 30 “Victor Bout” entities OFAC bragsabout freezing.Furthermore, the 30 big financial entities, as described by OFAC, weren’t big atall. In addition to Chichakli’s aircraft brokerage business, there were sixdormant corporations with no activities, one tax preparation office, one payrolland accounting practice, one used motorcycles dealership, two continuedprofessional education providers with no activities, a home renovation venture,and a swimming pool cleaning service. The other named entities were eitherclosed or dissolved, such as “Airbas Transportation,” Chichakli’s airline the USgovernment contracted to service American forces in Iraq.What I found telling, and at the same time disturbing, is that with all theextraordinary media hype that accompanied OFAC action against Bout, and to alesser degree Chichakli, the latter was not, and still is not, listed as havingany frozen assets in the United States. How do I know this? The US StateDepartment is under obligation to report to the United Nations’ Security Councilthe names of people who are sanctioned, and whose assets are frozen. Chichakli’sname is not listed as a person sanctioned by the US government, yet his assetswere reported as if they belonged to Victor Bout.I asked Richard Roper, United States attorney in charge of the Chichakli case,why the government had taken over seven years as of this writing (9/15/2002 -late 2009) to investigate Chichakli without any charges or indictment broughtagainst him. In context, the Enron investigation lasted slightly over one year.“I can’t comment on that,” replied the US attorney, Richard Roper. Where have Iheard that before?The US Treasury ordered the freezing of Chichakli’s assets and virtualtermination of his right to work, live, or exist in the United States. TheTreasury acted at the recommendation of the State Department, and in cooperationwith the DOJ, the CIA, Homeland Security, and other departments in the executivebranch according to the official statement released later by the US government.The cause of the action remains “SECRET” and the justification of the searchwarrant is forever “SEALED.”When I was searching for evidence against Chichakli, I came across an April 7,2006 UN Security Council report pursuant to resolution 1521 concerning Liberia.The report started with a note from the Syrian Arab Republic: “We have the honorto inform the Committee that the Syrian authorities found, on 13 June 2005, thename of Mamdouh Chichakli, which appears in the above mentioned list [the assetsfreeze list], on the account of Amal Amin Sabagh, as guardian of the account.Accordingly, the Syrian authorities have frozen the assets of Mr. Chichakli andhave blacklisted him.I did a double-take. This didn’t make any sense. The official United Nationsreport was stating in black and white that they had frozen the account ofChichakli’s seventy-year-old mother, Dr. Amal A. Sabagh. What’s more, the nameblacklisted on the report, Mamdouh Chichakli, belongs to Richard Chichakli’sdead father.No, I thought to myself. This was no mere mistake. This was done on purpose.If the United States government didn’t have Chichakli on their list, why wouldSyria go out of their way and put him on theirs? Furthermore, whose assets didthey freeze? What’s going on? Chichakli left Syria almost 45 years ago; becauseof his past family history in Syria he surely wouldn’t leave assets in a Syrianbank. If he had no assets in the country, then, what did the Syrian authoritiesfind?They found, according to the report, an “amount of monies not available.” Whynot available? Because Chichakli’s assets in Syria amounted to zero. Therefore,Syria froze nonexistent Chichakli assets in the country he hadn’t set foot inalmost half a century. Interesting. Something else drew my attention to the UNreport – the unsolicited, voluntary report by the Syrian government.Syria and the United States government working together? What’s the world comingto, I thought to myself. Paragraph 116 at the bottom of page 34 of the UN reportclearly shows that Syria was not among the countries contacted by the UN panelon Liberia. Then, why are sticking their nose into someone else’s business?What’s it to them?ONWARD CHRISTIAN SOLDIERSChichakli might not have known anything about non-existing assets in a Syrianbank, but he knew plenty about Operation Blessing, televangelist Pat Robertson’s“charity” in Africa, organized with the very same characters who were allegedlyworking hand-in-glove with Victor Bout.To prevent him from talking, Chichakli maintains, the US government offered hima deal – his life back and witness protection in exchange for saying that heknew Victor Bout to be an arms dealer. Chichakli refused, offering to testify,without immunity, to what he knew, not what the government wanted him to say. Hewas refused. Then, on April 26, 2005 the government counterattacked, seizing allof his records and assets.What did a God-fearing, Christian missionary like Pat Robertson do in Africa?Robertson’s African Development Company apparently used the cover of Robertson’stax-exempt “Operation Blessing” to smuggle conflict diamonds out of civilwar-ravaged Zaire, later renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo.71 Bout wouldhave surely known this. So would have Chichakli. Africa was Bout’s stompingground for almost a decade.Who was Robertson’s partner? Mass murderer Charles Taylor, former Liberianstrongman. The Robertson-Taylor Cayman Islandsbased front company was calledFreedom Gold, whose operations were overseen from Robertson’s offices inVirginia Beach, USA. What’s more, the US Special prosecutor for war crimes inSierra Leone, David Crane, charged in May 2005 that Taylor was harboringal-Qaeda members and training rebels throughout West Africa in exchange forblood diamonds.72 Now, if you are the US government, having a Richard Chichaklishine the light of truth on the transgressions of the Bush government’s favoriteBible thumper simply wouldn’t do.Chichakli was evidently ready to go public to show that Robertson was using hisOperation Blessing, a supposed non-profit Christian-aid organization, not toprovide aid to African victims of famine and war, but to transport equipment andsupplies for his various diamond-mining ventures on that continent, and at UStaxpayers’ expense. This was later confirmed by Max Blumenthal, a highlyrespected journalist writing for The Nation magazine on September 19, 2005: “Farfrom the media’s gaze, Robertson has used the taxexempt, non-profit OperationBlessing as a front for his shadowy financial schemes, while exerting hisinfluence within the Republican Party to cover his tracks.” And all, of course,in the name of Jesus.Chichakli needed to disappear. He was dangerous. Guantanamo was out of thequestion. He was too old to have been suddenly discovered as an al-Qaedafighter. What did the United States government do? In July 2006, theyrenditioned him to Syria, where he ended up in the hands of Syrian intelligenceagents. Impossible? Precedent setting case? Hardly. Ask Syrian-born CanadianMaher Arar, a telecommunications engineer, who was deported by the US governmentto Syria in 2002, where he was detained and tortured for almost a year. Despitea Canadian court ruling exonerating Arar of all charges and links to terrorism,the United States government to this day publicly insists that Arar isaffiliated with members of organizations they describe as terrorist.Intelligence sources have confirmed to me that the US government paid $4 millionto the ex-leader of the Syrian Republican Guard, General Adnan Makhlouf, to haveChichakli liquidated in Syria. The US government representative who made thepayment was a CIA operative working in Syria with diplomat status. ButChichakli, a former US Army intelligence officer, escaped. For the UnitedStates’ plans, that was a serious bummer. In fact, Chichakli’s liquidation wastaken for granted to such an extent that some of his confiscated assets begandisappearing, even before he was renditioned to Syria. All in all, Chichaklistates the FBI removed nearly $500,000 in diamonds, jewelry, cash andcollectible US notes of $500 and $1000 denominations. When Chichakli demanded toknow their whereabouts, the FBI claimed that the assets in questions weredelivered to OFAC. OFAC, in turn, claim not to know anything about them.If I ever had any faith in the mechanics of the United Nations and their innerworkings, after my Bout investigation that faith has been shattered forever.Back in 2002, a 59-page UN Security Council report confirmed British GulfInternational formed part of the Bout empire. The same UN investigators havealso scrutinized British Gulf International’s link with another airline thatflew into Iraq, Jetline, and found them to be tied to Bout. The Los AngelesTimes obtained Baghdad flight records, which clearly demonstrated that BritishGulf also flew for KBR, Halliburton’s subsidiary.With the UN Security Council conclusions in hand, and the true ownership of AirBas safely buried by the mainstream press, that made it a stunning four Bout aircargo firms working as subcontractors for the US government in Iraq at a timewhen Bout was apparently wanted for money laundering and arms smuggling byInterpol and the Belgian authorities, not to mention by the US government forhis ties to the Taliban and al-Qaeda! How can any of this be possible, I thoughtto myself. Then, I remembered. I had stepped through the looking glass into aparallel universe were everything was in reverse. The universe of changingloyalties and black ops in the name of someone’s far-reaching and farsightedforeign policy. For whom did all of these people work?The mainstream press’ timeline on the next series of events wasn’t difficult toput together. “Soon after the Los Angeles Times story appeared, Senate Democratsasked the State Department’s Richard Armitage and then Defense Department’s PaulWolfowitz to comment on the allegations. Neither knew anything, or so theyclaimed. Both, however, promised to look into the allegations.”73 Ironically,the final call on the contractors belongs to the Pentagon, and it was quiteobvious that the State Department’s inquiries, if they were ever made, wererejected.Wolfowitz finally responded when the pressure from Democrats in Congress becameunbearable. In a January 31, 2005 letter to Wisconsin Democratic Senator RussellFeingold, Wolfowitz acknowledged that “both the US Army and the CPA in Iraq didconduct business with companies that, in turn, subcontracted work to second tiersuppliers, who leased aircraft owned by companies associated with Mr. Bout.However, spokesmen for the US Central Command and the Pentagon brushed offinquiries on the subject saying they knew of no contracts with Bout-relatedcompanies. At the same time, they stressed the need to understand how complexcontracting arrangements were in Iraq. The Pentagon, a military official said,could not check out the subcontractors who actually flew the flights into Iraqand Afghanistan.”74If we are to believe the aforementioned reports from America’s leading corporatemedia publications, the consequences of Bout’s “far-flung operations” have beendevastating both in human cost and for long-term US geopolitical interests. Yet,the Pentagon, the paragon of American military might, would not give the subjectmatter the time of day. Perhaps, I thought to myself, there are too many peoplewho feel they need to keep Bout around to fly into the next Iraq or Afghanistan.There was something else that caught my attention in Michael Isikoff’s Newsweekarticle. He stated that “it took the Bush administration until July 2004 toissue an Executive Order # 3348 directing the Office of Foreign Assets Control(OFAC) to finally freeze Bout’s assets in the United States and forbid Americanfirms from doing business with him [emphasis added].” Furthermore, it took theUS government an additional nine months, until April 26, 2005, to freeze USassets of the 30 Bout-related companies. There was only one way to interpretthat – the Bush administration was stalling for time. There is only one way tointerpret the media’s assertions regarding Bout’s assets. They lied, brazenlyand blatantly. OFAC only has the power to go after Bout’s assets in the UnitedStates. Bout never had any assets in the United States, at least none thatFarah, Braun or the United States government has been able to show belonged toBout. The media knew that, of course, because we know. Someone was lining a duckup for a kill.Indeed, “the move against Bout proved largely symbolic. During the time betweenthe US designation and the UN listing, according to US and European intelligencesources, Bout revamped his operations, moving aircraft registrations andincorporating new companies. As a result, most of the designated companies nolonger have any assets to be frozen, and it will take months to identify the newcompanies and begin sanctioning them.”75 Who says so? You guessed it. DouglasFarah.As I continued to uncover one startling fact after another, I asked myself thesame, nagging question. If Bout was indeed a Merchant of Death, why was theUnited States government being “very slow” to act on comprehensive links betweenweapons trafficking and terrorism? Were these links and criminal synergiesallowed to take place and flourish? With irrefutable evidence mounting in frontof me, was it just possible that Victor Bout simply served as an extension ofAmerica’s foreign policy in Iraq, Afghanistan or Africa? How else could weinterpret the stonewalling and the lies?Needless to say, if we take this information at face value and try torationalize it, none of it makes any sense, at least not in any world we know.Again, in the real world, a Victor Bout operation would not have succeededbecause governments have the diplomatic, financial and intelligence clout todestroy the elements that threaten their sovereignty and the rule of law. And aBout-Taliban link would certainly qualify as such a destructive element.STILL HUNTINGThe US government’s punitive actions “were based on Bout’s relationship with[then-Liberian president] Taylor, but, in announcing the OFAC action, theTreasury Department stressed another facet of Bout’s activities, noting that hemade $50 million in profits from arms transfers to the Taliban when the regimewas hosting Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda.”76Still, if we were to take the aforementioned US Treasury Department statement atface value, Bout was delivering weapons to the Taliban and al-Qaeda at the sametime as the US government clandestinely contracted with him to work withAmerican forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. How surreal is that? The Office ofForeign Asset Control, however, is based out of the Treasury Department, andBout was being contracted by the Pentagon. Could this be a case of someremarkable incompetence in one department being utterly oblivious to what wasgoing on in another department of the government?This possibility loses credence with the addition of another strangecoincidence. How could both the US State Department and the British ForeignOffice allow such a high-profile case to slip through their nets? Perhaps thereal reason Victor Bout continued to enjoy relative immunity was his usefulnessin Iraq. What else could explain the undeniable fact that the coalitionpartners, the United States and Great Britain showed him exceptional favorswhile he did some of the dirtiest jobs for them? One French diplomat complainedthat “the American defense forces are using Victor’s planes for theirlogistics.” Would that make Bout an extension of someone else’s foreign policy?You bet, it would. “Is that why the condemnation of his role in the diamond warsand other conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade is being silentlyrepudiated?” poignantly asked the PBS documentary Gunrunners.The period of supposed “action” against Victor Bout coincided with the firstSadr uprising. In April 2004, Shiite firebrand cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and hisJaysh al-Mahdi militia rose in revolt against the US-led coalition in Iraq. TheUS forces quickly lost control of the roads and faced a serious problem. Neithersupplies nor ammunition were getting through. Even the heavily fortified GreenZone was suffering from a food shortage.According to Mother Jones in 2004, “Air Bas has continued to fly US militarymissions into Baghdad as well as the northern Iraqi air base of Balad, accordingto refueling records kept by the Defense Energy Support Center (DESC). DESCnotes that Air Bas flights have been approved by military commanders forofficial government purposes.”77Still, in the wider scheme of things, there was something missing. I scannedthrough Isikoff’s Newsweek article again and zeroed in on a paragraph I hadpreviously underlined. “The firms were contracted by Halliburton’s subsidiaryKellogg Brown & Root (KBR).” Then, I re-read the Los Angeles Times story. One ofthe paragraphs jumped out at me. “Among the firms holding US governmentcontracts that officials said were using the network’s services: FederalExpress.”Federal Express, I must admit, clearly took me by surprise. Could the referenceto FedEx be a mistake? Then, I found a reference to it in an Argentinepublication, Edicioni, through the LexisNexis search engine: “A Federal Expressofficial in the United Arab Emirates said Irbis was paid $22,000 for each of itsround-trip flights.” So, then, Bout was apparently cashing in through FedEx aswell by flying shipments for the US Air Force.I went back to the Times story. “KBR, formerly known as Kellogg Brown & Root, isa subsidiary of Halliburton, the Houston conglomerate formerly headed by VicePresident Dick Cheney and holder of a massive no-bid contract for reconstructionprojects in Iraq. Under pressure to move quickly on the crisis in Iraq,officials have paid little attention to the welter of subcontractors andsub-subcontractors involved in the massive reconstruction effort.”Back in May 2003, the CIA discreetly let it be known to the Pentagon that Bout’sfirms were cashing in on US-funded reconstruction efforts, but, “the warning didnot reach the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) until May 2004.”78 Anothercoincidence, perhaps? No, simply a well juxtaposed lie, as we now know that AirBas was a Chichakli company and not a Bout company. After conducting its owninquiry, the CPA allowed the companies to keep flying, “saying that onlymilitary officials could terminate their contracts.”79 The CPA was washing itshands of the entire matter.Going over the Bout-Bush-Halliburton-KBR-Cheney-private contractor story made mewonder. When did anyone in charge become aware that supposedly one branch of theUS government was offloading millions of dollars to an individual whom theUnited Nations, Belgium, France and another branch of the US government wastrying to put in prison? “After all, it takes an internationally organizednetwork of individuals,” according to the United Nations December 21, 2000,report, “well-funded, well-connected and well-versed in brokering and logistics,to move illicit cargo around the world without raising the suspicion of lawenforcement.”The report was insinuating that Bout is larger than life, more powerful than anynation on Earth, destined to control the world, unless he is permanentlystopped. The worse it looks (meaning the “sexier” the report), the better itsells. The more attention being paid to it by the mainstream press, the greaterthe media frenzy and the higher the ratings. Higher ratings attract advertiserswilling to spend lavishly, knowing that the American people need a daily diet ofever-present images of suffering, malnourished and dead bodies as part of aglossy propaganda campaign beamed into every living room in America.What was never explained in any of the hundreds of articles on Bout was thesources of the sophisticated weaponry that he sold. As a retired CIAwhistleblower (who had run an illicit gun trade through members of the Pakistaniintelligence in the Waziristan tribal autonomous area situated between Pakistanand Afghanistan) once told me, “You don’t just walk into a weapons factory andorder 15 million rounds of ammunition.” We can surmise that much of thismateriel came from the old Soviet bloc, but at least its distribution hasrequired the connivance of Western factions.“When the Bush administration took over,” reported Peter Landesman in the NewYork Times Magazine, “National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice told USintelligence, as far as Victor Bout was concerned, to look but not to touch.”80According to former intelligence officer for the NSA, Wayne Madsen, “USintelligence agencies considered Rice’s move to call off all operations, aimedat Bout to be inexplicable, given Bout’s direct links to arms smuggling to theTaliban and al-Qaeda, as well as to other areas rife with Islamic terroristgroups.”But, the Bush administration was not the only Western government covering up forBout. In May 2004, the French government complained, according to a FinancialTimes article, that Washington and London were not supporting a move by the UNto freeze Bout’s assets for his role in supporting Liberia’s dictator CharlesTaylor. Paris also alleged that the US and Britain were permitting Bout’s firmsto operate freely in occupied Iraq, including his air cargo companies beinginvolved in supplying coalition forces.81 When Britain appeared ready to agreeto put the squeeze on Bout’s operations, the Bush administration pressuredLondon to relent.82This was sheer madness. As I examined Bout’s supposed network of internationalcriminals, I realized that Bout had merely become the fall guy for acriminalized political structure much larger, far more hidden and moredangerous, than Bout himself. Something else dawned on me about Victor Bout. Hewas nothing but a creature of the post-Cold War era, the personification ofdisorganized crime, the exploiter of chaos – he was well funded, well connected,well versed in brokering and logistics, a highly mobile global enabler,apparently loyal to no country and with only the unadulterated motive of pureprofit in mind.But just when I thought I had reached the end, the world was treated tospectacular scenes of Bout-inspired pandemonium during his high profile arrestin Bangkok in March 2008. No, I thought to myself as I boarded a Thai AirlinesBangkok-bound flight, the world had not heard the last of Victor Bout, nor ofhis ragtag partners in crime.BOUT’S ARRESTVictor Bout, an alleged international arms trafficker was arrested at theSofitel Hotel on Silom Road in Bangkok on March 6, 2008 along with hisassociate, Mr. Andrew Smulian, by six officers of the US government and threeThai officers following a long-term international sting operation involvingdozens of US undercover drug agents and agencies, the Royal Thai Police, theRomanian Border Police, the Romanian Prosecutor’s Office Attached to the HighCourt of Cassation and Justice, the Korps Politie Curacao of the NetherlandsAntilles, and the Danish National Police Security Services. The operationincluded over 200 Thai special forces operatives who immediately locked down thehotel. Bout was the man the United States government wanted most after Osama binLaden.Jewel in the crown. Man behind the terror. Merchant of Death. The most unsavorycharacter alive. High priest and the foremost representative of a globalpotpourri of scum. After years of retracing Bout’s steps, one would assume theUS government would have hit the ground running in their extradition request, inwhat many experts felt at the time was a mere formality.According to the official March 6, 2008, court documents, the United States DrugEnforcement Administration (DEA), announced the unsealing of charges againstViktor Bout, a/k/a “Boris,” a/k/a “Victor Anatoliyevich Bout,” a/k/a “VictorBut,” a/k/a “Viktor Budd,” a/k/a “Viktor Butt,” a/k/a “Viktor Bulakin,” a/k/a“Vadim Markovich Aminov,” an international arms dealer, and his associate AndrewSmulian, for conspiring to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to theFuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) – a designated foreignterrorist organization.I’m not sure of the basis of much of this information, but I do know that duringBout’s extradition hearing in a Bangkok courtroom, the judge asked the DEAofficers if they knew who Bout was. “Of course we do,” one man replied. “I haveseen the film.” He was referring to a Hollywood movie, Lord of War, a politicalcrime thriller starring Nicholas Cage in the role of Victor Bout, Merchant ofDeath.I carefully re-read the full complaint and over 800 pages of pertinentdocuments. According to the Complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court:Between November 2007 and February 2008, Bout and Smulian agreed to sell to theFARC millions of dollars worth of weapons — including surface-to-air missilesystems (SAMs) and armor-piercing rocket launchers. During a series of recordedtelephone calls and emails, Bout and Smulian agreed to sell the weapons to twoconfidential sources working with the DEA (the “CSs”), who held themselves outas FARC representatives acquiring these weapons for the FARC’s use in Colombia.In addition, during a series of consensually recorded meetings in Romania,Smulian advised the CSs, among other things, that: (1) Bout had 100 SAMsavailable immediately; (2) Bout could also provide helicopters and armorpiercing rocket launchers; (3) Bout could arrange to have a flight crew airdropthe weapons into Colombian territory using combat parachutes; and (4) Bout andSmulian would charge the CSs $5 million to transport the weapons. During one ofthe meetings with the CSs, Smulian provided one of them with a digital memorystick that contained an article about Bout, and documents containing photographsand specifications for the SAMs and armor-piercing rocket launchers that Smulianhad previously said Bout could provide.In between his meetings with the CSs, Smulian spoke to Bout over a cell phoneprovided to him by one of the CSs at the direction of the DEA. Theseconversations between Smulian and Bout were legally intercepted by foreignauthorities. During one of these conversations, Bout and Smulian discussed the$5 million delivery fee for the weapons. Bout also told Smulian, in codedlanguage, that the weapons requested by the CSs were ready to be delivered.Subsequent to these phone calls with Smulian, Bout engaged in multiple recordedphone calls with one of the CSs, during which they arranged the March 6, 2008meeting in Bangkok. According to the court documents, Bout and Smulian werecharged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designatedforeign terrorist organization.The following day, I watched a live press conference starring the leadprosecuting US Attorney, Michael J. Garcia, who said, “Viktor Bout and AndrewSmulian agreed to arm terrorists with high-powered weapons that have fueled someof the most violent conflicts in recent memory. Today, they face charges in theUnited States for agreeing to provide weapons to a terrorist organization thathas threatened, and continues to threaten, American interests.”“This arms trafficker was poised to arm a narco-terrorist organization, but henow faces justice in the United States,” said DEA Acting Administrator MicheleM. Leonhart. It looked like Bout’s extradition was a foregone conclusion.Remarkably, after 533 days, on August 11, 2009, Mr. Jittakorn Wattanasin, ChiefJustice of the Thai court, rejected the United States plea to extradite him.I called James Entwistle, deputy chief of mission at the US embassy in Thailand.“Are you familiar with the full set of documents presented in the case, signedby the Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice?”“Of course, I am.”“Point “gg” on page 10 states that ‘On or about March 6, 2008, during a meetingin Thailand, after CS-3 explained that the FARC wanted to kill American forcesin Colombia, Bout indicated that the fight against the United States was alsohis fight and that he intended to supply the FARC with arms.’ Do you have it ontape and if you do, can I hear it?” I asked him.“I can’t comment on that,” he shot back.Of course.I called Michael A. Braun (no relation to author Steven Braun), a 34-year DEAveteran who had spearheaded the Bout hunt from the beginning. Since retiringfrom the force, he had joined Spectre Group International as its ManagingPartner. Michael Braun appears to be a poster boy of 21st century lawenforcement, a gun-wielding goon with a my-way-or-the-highway,end-justifies-means attitude. It seemed to me that nothing was out of bounds forthis fellow, from lying to cheating to kidnapping witnesses to forging officialgovernment documents to bribing key witnesses, all in the name of law and order,or should I say, One-World law and order.I introduced myself and asked him about Bout’s arrest.“Do you know if the meeting was recorded?”“I can’t comment on that,” he said decisively.“What happened in court?” I asked him.“We are mystified by the ruling, to be honest with you, Daniel.”“Why is that?”Michael Braun explained to me the dangers of international terrorism, and theFARC in particular, to world stability.“But the people who were allegedly buying weapons from an alleged arms dealerwere not FARC, but rather US government agents.”“In the United States, you need to show the intent of sale to allegedterrorists. That’s enough.”“Except, you were not in the United States, but in Thailand,” I shot back. “Andin Thailand, according to the law, you have to actually be FARC to show intent,not someone masquerading as FARC.”“There is no doubt FARC are terrorists,” he replied. Michael Braun clearly“missed” my point.“When the DEA were planning this operation, why didn’t it occur to anyone tocheck the local laws? I mean it looks like someone wanted this man to get off.”“I can’t answer that, Daniel.”Then I asked a key question.“Michael, why didn’t the US government agree to pay Bout the $2 million advancehe asked for? I mean it would be stupid for not to pay the money when you havethe once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to seize both 100 anti-aircraft missiles aswell as Victor Bout. Don’t you agree?”“Hello, hello? I can’t hear you.”All right, I thought to myself, I will pretend you can’t hear me, and you canpretend that you would really love to help, except for the bad connection.On September 29, 2009, I emailed Braun a list of 10 questions dealing withspecifics of the case, explaining the urgency of the request due to a pendingdeadline.MichaelI am sorry for the bad reception. I wanted to ask you a few questions and itwould be great if you find a few moments to answer them. Thank you in advance.Hope you are well.Most of my questions involved the obvious discrepancies discussed here. One wasobvious, but not yet mentioned: Why is the DEA involved in this case? Anotherwas so far from obvious that it may startle you: How did Andrew Smulian end upin the United States?Failing to hear from Michael Braun, special agent in charge of the Victor Boutinvestigation, I sent him another email one week later.Hi MichaelThis is Daniel Estulin, again. I have a feeling you might not have received myemail….As you can see my questions are very case-specific. Again, I am working on thedeadest of deadlines and need to hear back from you by Wednesday of this week,meaning tomorrow. My publisher has very magnanimously extended my deadline.I would like to add another matter to this list.About eight months ago, one of your men by the name of Derek Odney, an assistantUS District Attorney, met with a former Russian officer, a specialist in nucleartechnology who was working on Bout’s defense. The meeting took place in front ofthe US Embassy. This two-hour meeting was photographed by your people.How do I know? Because several of your Embassy staff are my readers.What I imagine you don’t know is that the meeting was also audio- andvideo-recorded by the Russians. As it turns out, the Russian officer was a lotsmarter than Odney because after two hours of beating around the bush, he wasable to get Odney to say on tape that you (i.e., the US) will pay him (a Russianofficer) any amount of money he wants if he just gets out of the way and letsyou extradite Bout. If you have the proof that Bout is the Merchant of Death,why would you compromise the entire operation in this way?Michael, my books are read by millions around the world and my interviews areheard by tens of millions. I would very much like to get your side of itcorrectly. If I can’t, I will just have to work with the assumptions I have,based on available information or lack of it.Hoping to hear from you.Daniel EstulinAuthor of The True Story of the Bilderberg GroupAfter more queries, I finally received a reply from Michael Braun, on October16, 2009, tartly claiming that he dealt only with “professional journalists,”not “conspiracy buffs.” Ouch! He then wished me a “wonderful weekend,” with“regards.” Aaah, that felt so much better!Having failed to get anywhere with former special agent Michael Braun, Icontacted Andrew Smulian’s lawyer, Mary Elizabeth Mulligan. She is a partner atthe New York law firm Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman LLP. The company’sclient-list reads like who’s who of the rich and famous. Certainly, some of themost powerful of the Bilderberg Group heavyweights and Wall Street were at onetime or another represented by Friedman Kaplan Seiler & Adelman: Bertelsmann,Lazard Frères, and MasterCard.As Bout’s and Smulian’s cases are intimately linked, I sent Ms. Mulligan anemail on October 12, 2009.Hi MaryMy name is Daniel Estulin. I understand you represent Andrew Smulian.I am an investigative journalist working against the deadest of deadlines on abook. One of the chapters deals with Victor Bout. I am in Bangkok, so I am veryfamiliar with the case….Amongst other things, I would love to find out how did Andrew make it to theUnited States?Again, Mary, I am working on a deadline. My books on the Bilderberg Group havesold millions of copies around the world. My work is followed by tens ofmillions.Let me know when it might be convenient to speak to you. If there is anything Ican do to help you in your case from here, please let me know.Daniel EstulinIn less than twenty-four hours, I received Ms. Mulligan’s reply: “No comment.”Hoping against hope, a couple of days later I tried another tack.MaryIn the real world we would be playing on the same team. Your client and Bout arein the same boat, sort of. The difference is that Bout is going to go free andyour client will be imprisoned, unless, of course he is a government agent.Michael Braun, former DEA agent in charge of Bout’s investigation and currentlyemployed as a senior partner with Spectre told me he had nothing to say when Iasked him how Smulian got to New York….I have a lot of very valuable information to offer your client in his defense.Information, that will most surely get him off.Needless to say, in the real world, a lawyer looking after the client’s bestinterests would jump at a chance to talk to me.Do you?Hope you are well.DanielI have not heard back from Mary Mulligan.Andrew Smulian’s first court appearance took place on March 10, 2008. Sincethen, there has been a virtual lockdown on any information about him. Bout hasbeen in court over a dozen times in the same span of time, every one of hisappearances followed by a media frenzy. Yet, the mainstream press has beensuspiciously silent on Andrew Smulian. Why?There was something else that bothered me about Smulian’s camp. Why would apowerful Wall Street law firm defend the interests of someone who is by mostreports a penniless, low-life gunrunner, one of the “potpourri of scum” asMichael Braun called them. Compassion? Gosh, can you imagine! Were they actuallyplanning on beating the United States government in court? Smulian was beingaccused of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terroristorganization. That’s at least a decade in the slammer, by my calculations. Whatif Mary Mulligan and her people were making sure he was safely delivered intothe waiting arms of Uncle Sam? After all, if the entire Bout case is a farce, ashas been shown thus far in Thai court and in my book, you wouldn’t want Smulianrepresented by an honest lawyer, truly working on Smulian’s defense. The factthat the United States government always knew that Bout, the so-called Merchantof Death, had no rockets to deliver to anyone, be it the FARC or Santa Claus,must forever remain hidden from the susceptible masses. Otherwise … No, therewon’t be an otherwise. That’s why one of Wall Street’s most prestigious firms isthere, marking territory.I gave it one last shot. On October 20, 2009 I emailed Brendon Robert McGuire,who has represented the US government in its proceeding against Smulian.Hi BrendanMy name is Daniel Estulin. I am an investigative journalist working against thedeadest of deadlines on my new book. One third of the book deals with VictorBout and Andrew Smulian.Since we haven’t heard anything about Mr. Smulian lately, I wanted to ask you ifthe US government and Smulian are negotiating a plea bargain?Also, can you tell me when is Mr. Smulian’s next court appearance?Finally, I would love to know how Mr.Smulian made his way to New York. If youhave the time, I would love to interview you for my book.Thank you ahead of timeDaniel EstulinI wasn’t holding out much hope, but Mr. McGuire surprised me and responded thefollowing day. He stated that Yusill Scribner, of the Southern District of NewYork US Attorney’s press office, was being assigned to assist me “to the extentpossible.” Less than three hours later, I received a follow-up email from Mr.Scribner, supplying the docket sheet and “waiver of indictment” in the case ofUS v. Smulian. He also asked for my phone number and a “convenient time” when wemight be able to chat.I replied immediately, hoping that my very relevant questions would for once, beanswered.YusillThank you very much for your reply. Probably the easiest thing to do is for meto send you a list of case-specific questions re Smulian/Bout. Once I have youranswers I will most definitely call you.1. How did Andrew Smulian make it to New York?2. How much of your success in Smulian’s prosecution depends on whether VictorBout is acquitted or convicted?3. Where are the weapons Bout and Smulian were allegedly willing to sell to theundercover DEA agents posing as the FARC?4. Why didn’t the US agree to pay Bout the $2 million he allegedly demanded asan advanced payment? Wouldn’t it make it easier to prosecute them both if youactually had something concrete to show as evidence? The reason I ask is that ina Thai court the US had no evidence of Bout’s transgressions. Doodles and a mapdo not count.5. Why is the DEA involved in the case?6. What is Derek Odney’s role in the case? The reason I ask is the following:About eight months ago, Derek Odney had met in Bangkok with a former Russianofficer, specialist in nuclear technology who was working on Bout’s defense. Themeeting took place in front of the US Embassy. This two-hour meeting wasphotographed by the US people. What I imagine Derek doesn’t know is that themeeting was also audio- and video-recorded by the Russians. As it turns out, theRussian officer was a lot smarter than Odney because after two hours of beatingaround the bush, he was able to get Odney to say on tape that the US governmentwill pay him (a Russian officer) any amount of money he wants if he just getsout of the way and let’s the USG extradite Bout. If the government’s caseagainst Bout and Smulian is airtight, why would Derek compromise the entireoperation in this way?Furthermore, how can I arrange to see Mr. Smulian in prison for an interview? Iemailed Mary Mulligan, but she is away on business until October 26.Hope you are well.DanielSix days later, I received the all-to-familiar reply: “No comment.” Alsoincluded was an invitation to “feel free to email or call” regarding any“follow-up.” How can I “follow up” on no information? That was the end of that.All the detours had only led to one more “Dead end…. Road out…. Proceed at ownrisk.”THAI FOOD FOR THOUGHTThe Court’s decision was called “a bitter blow” by the US government, but seeingwhat transpired throughout the case, it could only have been expected. Mostsignificantly, the Public Prosecutor states that the Defendant was allegedly“involved in conspiracy to commit crime with ‘FuerZas Armadas Revolucionarias deColombia Ejercito del Pueblo’ (FARC).” Unfortunately for the prosecution, thisis a non-starter, because, as appears from the materials of the actualcase-file, Victor Bout was not dealing with any real person from FARC, butrather with a group of agent-provocateurs (all of them American nationals, noneof them Colombian).Of course, as one would expect in a sting, it was not Bout who approached thephony FARC operatives in the first instance. The DEA ops masquerading as FARCfirst approached him, with offers to buy a plane. This was later presented assoliciting “portable anti-aircraft missiles and other war weapons.” And over thecourse of the Thai proceedings these morphed into “guided ballistic missiles,”as the latter description appears in the Public Prosecutor’s appeal.What is absolutely clear is that Bout was not involved in a conspiracy to commita crime with FARC in Thailand, as claimed by the Public Prosecutor, becauseunder Thai law one can not enter a conspiracy with someone who is onlyimpersonating a conspirator. Phantom FARC was joining phantom evidence, phantomjournalism, phantom sources and not-so-phantom-but-equally-absurd walledcompounds and multiple passports.The Thai police from the Crime Suppression Division, acting on an explicitrequest of Mr. Derek Odney, one of the American DEA agents in Bangkok, haveinvestigated Bout in connection with the Penal Code of Thailand, Section 135.They spent 33 days on their inquiry into the events, but were unable to discoversufficient evidence to prosecute Bout in a Thai court.The actual points the Public Prosecutor appeals against the judgment of theCourt of First Instance are haphazardly concocted of half-truths. The PublicProsecutor has claimed that all four counts of the offences alleged against theDefendant in the United States are also considered crimes in accordance with thelaw of the Kingdom of Thailand. Bout’s defense team rather easily dismissedthese claims.Consider counts 1 and 2: “Conspiracy to kill US nationals” and “Conspiracy tokill officers and employees of he US.” How was this to be done? Why, through theacquisition and use of the alleged missiles by FARC of course. But these countsfail for the reason discussed above: the alleged FARC conspirators wereimposters.Count 3, “Conspiracy to acquire and use anti-aircraft missiles,” fails for thesame reason, but also has an even more glaring defect. Though an offence underUS law, which prescribes a sentence of at least 25 years up to lifeimprisonment, no such or similar crime is defined in Thai law. Can this reallyhave been simply a bonehead move on the part of US authorities? The acts werecommitted in Thailand, Thai law does not prohibit the acts, case closed.Count number 4, “Conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terroristorganization,” provides another interesting window on the case. This is indeed acrime under the penal code of both countries – the United States of America andthe Kingdom of Thailand (Section 135 of its Penal Code). In fact, as noted, Thaiauthorities investigated the charges leveled against Bout there. Theirinvestigation has led to no charges against him, but the extraditionproceedings, now under appeal by the US, have made clear that the Thai judicialsystem stands ready to prosecute him under its own laws should appropriateevidence be found. Again, why would US officials not anticipate this?The American agents were unable either to catch Victor Bout, the allegedMerchant of Death, red-handed with missiles destined for the FARC or to seizeany single missile that could be traced back to him. When the US government wentto court, not even one anti-aircraft missile was produced as evidence. Thaicourts recognized the obvious: It is not possible to conspire to kill anyonewith a missile if you do not have a missile.The court proceedings in Thailand have been a disgrace. If only the Americanpeople knew what was being done in their name. The Three Stooges could have donebetter on their worst day. Unless, of course, we are playing with a marked deckof cards, and the Victor Bout diversion is just another stop in the endlessparallel universe of lies and deception.There are too many unanswered questions in the whole scenario. Where are themissiles? Why did the US government go into court empty handed, asking the Thaicourt to take them at their word? Why didn’t the DEA pay the $2 million as Bouthad allegedly asked when they had already spent in excess of $30 million tryingto capture him? The acceptance of the payment would seal his fate. Why didn’tthey trace the origin of the missiles? Why didn’t anyone double-check the Thailaws for compatibility?In the light of the above considerations, it is absolutely irrelevant if theFARC were indeed a truly political organization, or a truly terroristorganization, just as it doesn’t matter if the Thai government recognizes theFARC as a terrorist organization or not. The logic of the case under Thai law,bound with total absence of physical anti-aircraft missiles, exonerates Bout andprecludes his extradition to the United States. This is something that formerDEA agent-in-charge, Michael Braun, apparently refuses to acknowledge.How can the US government not have foreseen this? Another coincidence, perhaps?The mere fact that alleged FARC terrorists were proven to be true-blue AmericanDEA agents and the mere fact that these American agent-provocateurs were notable to seize a single anti-aircraft missile alleged to belong to Bout areenough reason to dismiss the accusations against him and for the Thais to refusethe extradition request.But, there is more. Just when it appeared the Thai courts might acquiesce andextradite Bout to the United States, the Colombian government, following theUnited States’ official request, sent the Thai court a 607-point brochure on thedangers of the FARC. The Colombian Foreign Minister lecturing the Thai judiciaryon the possible inadequacy of Thai laws? If you wanted to antagonize someone,can you think of a more ingenious way of doing it? I can’t.Then, there is the overriding question of morality. Does the United States,today, have the international moral authority to be taken at its word? Perhapsnot.Consider Dutch timber merchant, Gus Kouwenhoven, charged, at the request of theUnited States, with arms smuggling and war crimes in Liberia in the 1990s. TheUN’s Expert Panel Report on Sierra Leone alleged Gus Kouwenhoven to be “part of[former Liberian president Charles] Taylor’s inner circle, responsible for thelogistical aspects of many of the arms deals.” On June 7, 2006, Kouwenhoven wassentenced in the Netherlands to 8 years in jail for arms smuggling. Theallegations were later found to be groundless, when the UN Court of Appeal inThe Hague acquitted Kouwenhoven of all charges on March 10, 2008, and sharplycriticized the work of the prosecution. The Dutch government had alreadyacknowledged that the Kouwenhoven trial was ridden with false accusations,bribing of witnesses, and gross mismanagement of justice by the Dutch courts.Then, there is the case of United States vs. Cassin Abdullah Kati and Al BarakaInternational Foundation, who were sanctioned, persecuted, and prosecutedbecause the US government alleged to have evidence that these entities werespearheading terrorism and terror groups around the world. On September 3, 2008,the European Court of Justice ruled that the allegations presented as evidenceby the US government were false. The European Court of Justice ordered themembers of the EU to disregard the UN sanctions placed upon these entities.And conversely, on October 27, 2009, the French courts convicted apower-elite-connected group that had flaunted a UN embargo, selling $790 milliondollars worth of arms into the Angola civil war arena between 1983 and 1998. Thegroup included a son of the late French president Francois Mitterrand,Jean-Christophe Mitterrand; a “Russian-Israeli businessman,” Arkady Gaydamak; aFrench arms dealer, Pierre Falcone; and scandal-plagued right-wing politicianand former French Interior Minister, Charles Pasqua. This was at the time and inthe arena focused upon by UN investigator Johann Peleman. Yet with all theresources at his disposal, not one word appeared about these power-elite armssmugglers. Instead those resources focused strictly upon Bout, beginning hisdemonization.At one point during Bout’s last court appearance in September 2009, against theguard’s objections, I moved to the front row and sat next to him, to his left.He acknowledged my presence with a nod. For several seconds neither one of ussaid anything.“Victor,” I whispered, leaning my head in his direction, “if there is one thingyou could wish for now, what would it be?”There was a very long pause. “Home.” All traces of a smile left his lips.The images were there, the indescribable moments remembered, but until this verymoment, they had been pushed out of his life only to rise up and attack himwhenever the memories refused to stay buried. He closed his eyes. How he wishedfor oblivion, for temporary reprieve, if only long enough to drown his sorrowand have the nightmare recede. A veiled, vacuous look passed his face and VictorBout turned around and looked at me. Then, he smiled.“Do you know that joke about the Moon and the Russian President?” he asked inRussian.To his right, the Russian consul moved his large body sideways to hear it. TwoRussian journalists walked in and sat in the last row, talking quietly.Time is a true narcotic for pain. Either the pain disappears when it runs itscourse, or the person learns to live with it. The pain had not disappeared, butI could tell Victor Bout sensed that there was going to be an end to hisconfinement.*****What a world we live in. Competing nation-state propaganda and psychologicalwarfare operations tell us black is white and white is black, these lies andmisdirections create gray areas, the operative realm of the Shadow Masters. Forwhen governments operate in extreme secrecy, allowing their intelligenceagencies to operate with impunity and beyond oversight, then the noble ideals ofstatecraft may be hijacked by the Men behind the Curtain, playing nation-statesagainst each other in a Hegelian dance of conflict and resolution.The terrorist attacks on American soil in 2001 were nurtured by a far greatermenace than simple blind hatred acted out by Islamist insurgents from theirAfghani and Pakistani hideouts. These acts come from beyond the two-dimensionallandscape of opposing sides presented daily by the pundits and talking heads.These shadow plays disrupt our lives with blatant corruption, loaded agendas,and continually spin us from one “crisis” to another. This aberration, like ahidden monster, drives many acts, whether ushered from right-wing Christianfundamentalist groups, oil company board rooms, Wahhabi mosques, lobbying firmsand think tanks in Washington and New York, private banks in the emirates of thePersian Gulf, Hasidic-run “blood diamond” centers in Europe and New York, orarms depots of the former Warsaw Pact.This sinister influence is confirmed by an epic number of “coincidences,” anddocumented connections, among the CIA, the United Nations, the DEA, the FBI,Interpol, Belgian and British authorities, the United Nations, Christianfundamentalists and Russian-Israeli mob interests. The engine driving manyworld-changing events is not ideology, not religion, not politics and certainlynot patriotism. And money does seem to motivate many players – willing pawns ofthose who lust for control of humanity’s future.Once any large-scale military venture, be it “legitimate” or terrorist, acquiressignificant funding, greed will compete to supply its needs.Notes1.

I pulled out 500 Bahts, an equivalent of $15, a twentieth ofthe local average monthly salary. “Now!” I said. The man grabbed the money andhanded me his beat-up cell phone.“Where are you calling me from?” my source asked inquisitively.“A taxi. Did you know there are only six payphones for fifteen million Bangkokresidents?” I added.“Let me talk to the driver,” my source requested coldly, maybe concerned I waskidnapped and held at gunpoint.I passed a puzzled driver his phone. After several quick questions the taxidriver bobbed his head affirmatively up and down and gave me back his phone.“I didn’t know you spoke Thai?” I told my source half mockingly.“There are lots of things you still don’t know about me, sweetheart.”“So …” My question hung in the air for a split second before dissolving into themuggy Bangkok early-morning air.“You know what was the first question DEA agents asked Victor Bout?”“No,” I replied. “Do you?” A fire truck went by, the wail of its sirens drowningout every other noise around us.He paused. “They asked him the name of the cruise missiles he had sold to Iran.”I bolted forward, in the process bumping my head against the windshield.“Why would they ask him that? What’s their game?” I asked, my mind working at athousand revolutions per second.“This is a big-boys game.”Bout was being set up, the ground cleared, the markers fixed.“X-55!” I blurted out, realizing instantaneously the monstrosity of the gambitbeing run from behind the scenes.“That’s right. Cruise missiles, nuclear warheads,” came a low-pitched voice fromthe other end of the line. A moment later the line went dead.I needed time to figure this out. Then I winced, suddenly remembering lastnight’s short message from my publisher: “We are supposed to be going to printin three days. What’s up?”There was no going back. Publishing a book is like assembling a car. The bookitself is not the car, but a small piece of the car, say an engine. Once thedate is set, the ghost in the machine responsible for the entire operationbecomes insatiable. Distributors prepare the delivery trucks, stores preparebook-shelf space, radio stations book interviews and build their programs aroundyour title, graphic designers at local and national newspapers work diligentlyat making your advertising campaign look the best possible, online stores suchas amazon.com sell pre-ordered copies at discount, hoping to cash in on loyalreaders’ excitement. Therefore, when the book is delayed, sometimes even by aday, it can cause considerable damage not only to the author’s reputation, butalso to everyone’s bottom line.Three days. I had three days. There is an old saying in Russian that once afight is over, waving your fists around is a royal waste of time. If I hadmissed something, I had three days to figure it out. After that …I reeled myself in, shut down that line of thought. Thinking tangentially, atthis point, was the enemy, as was time.Cruise missiles, nuclear warheads, Iran, big-boys game, X-55?Iran was knee-deep into their nuclear program. But, what did it have to do withBout?What was the game? What were they after? The DEA wouldn’t have asked Bout aboutcruise missiles unless they had a very good reason. This wasn’t a knee-jerkreaction from an inexperienced agent, questioning a presumed weapons merchant.This was well thought out, a lever pulled at the right moment, approved at thehighest levels of the US government, part of the United States government’sunspoken policy initiative. I knew that nobody would make a move without thedirective itself being signed and countersigned by everyone from the Secretaryof State and the Director of the CIA through their various underlings andbeyond. The DEA’s involvement implied the consent of the US Attorney General.But why? And for what purpose? I leaned against the wall, staring at awall-to-wall collection of boxes related to the Shadow Masters investigation,filled with documents and other papers, labeled according to subject matters andmonths.Wait a moment! That report!I pulled off three heavy yellow boxes atop an even larger red box, ripping withmy fingers at the thick tape. “It better be here,” I thought to myself,rummaging through a box full of papers separated by markers and plastic.“Here it is,” I exclaimed aloud, feeling a charge going through me. Could Ireally have missed something this significant and not realized it until now?The report in question was the March 2008 (volume 6, number 3) issue ofTransnational Threats Update, put out by the Washington, DC, Center forStrategic and International Studies.The very first section dealt with Victor Bout’s arrest. I had read it back inMarch 2008, then again several months later. It was from “combined dispatches,”a term referring to material rehashed from the international media. It containedthe usual disinformation, with Bout possessing “more aliases and identificationpapers than a sports team,” and described his arrest in a sting operation alongwith his associate Robert [sic] Smulian. Now, a couple of pages further on,something else jumped out at me.“FARC seeking uranium for a dirty bomb” read the subhead under “NuclearThreats.” It reported reports of “a Ukrainian organized crime group” sellingenriched uranium stolen from Russia, and that they had negotiated with the FARCin Bucharest, Romania regarding the sale of “uranium and other arms.” But thelast paragraph underscored what I had missed, linking Bout to the FARCdirty-bomb plot through noting that Andrew Smulian (yes, this time they got thename right) had been “captured on the strength of a Romanian intelligence tip.”Until my source gave me the heads-up, I must admit, I didn’t put the twoelements together into one sentence. Now, there was a clever wickedness to theentire episode, which smelled of someone else’s farsighted foreign policyagenda. Bout was being aligned with the other little ducks for a major kill.To be triple sure, I went back and re-read the entire case history of VictorBout’s arrest. If the DEA had set “markers,” something in the US PublicProsecutor’s documents would have to back it up. It had to be there. A tickingtime bomb primed to go off, exposed at a pre-determined time – a public recordburied among a myriad of accusations and boring drivel.I rolled the dice and they came out snake eyes, twice. First, the original setof documents consisting of 50 pages and signed by Secretary Rice had no tickingbomb. Neither did the second set of documents consisting of 45 pages andtechnical information of alleged manuals confiscated from Bout. Then I rolledthe third time and hit the jackpot.Deeply buried within sheet 2 from the Public Prosecutor’s August 26, 2009appeal, point 3 clearly stated, “In/about November 2007 to March 2008, theaccused and his conspirator(s) conspired to provide, supply and train the use ofwar weapons such as surface-to-air missiles, guided ballistic missiles,including devices and components for assembly, installation and modification toFARC group …” [emphasis added].Christ Almighty! How skillful and how deceptive. It was unfathomable, yet it wasthere, in front of me, in black and white.The FARC equals Bout equals ballistic missiles equals nuclear terrorism. Thiswasn’t Mickey Mouse stuff. This was serious shit.Three days. Three days to figure it out, write it down, and send it off.The FARC: the nuclear “taint” all started with them. Here’s what I have found.On Saturday, March 1, 2008, Colombian commandoes carried out a combined groundand air cross-border assault on the encampment of unsuspecting FARC guerillas;the FARC had been fighting the Colombian government for over four decades. Theassault took place in the jungles of Ecuador, about 1.2 miles south of theEcuadoran border city of Lago Agrios. Raul Reyes, the FARC’s second-in-command,along with twenty-four other guerillas, was killed.I again re-read several hundred articles I had amassed on the subject. Mostappeared in mainstream publications between March 2 and March 20, 2008. Theparty line as well as the narrative was clear and easy to discern. The Colombiangovernment claimed that they recovered, at the scene of the carnage, threelaptop commuters belonging to Raul Reyes, which showed:• FARC connections with Ecuadoran president Rafael Correa.• Records of $300 million offerings from Hugo Chavez.• Uranium purchasing records.• An admission to planting a 2003 car bomb that killed 36 at a Bogotaupper-crust club.• Directions on how to make a dirty bomb.• A letter to Libya’s Moammar Gadhafi asking for cash to buy surface-to-airmissiles.• Information on Russian illegal arms dealer Victor Bout.• FARC funding of Correa’s campaign.• Cuban links to the FARC.The allegations were made without a shred of documentary evidence to back up theColombian government’s assertions. None of it was new. All the usual potpourriof individuals who collectively represented anti-American interests, from Chavezto Castro’s Cuba to Chavez’s ally, Ecuadoran president Rafael Correa, to MoammarGadhafi and even the “Merchant of Death” Victor Bout were present and accountedfor. Most of the information apparently gleaned from the FARC computers has bynow been exposed as fraudulent, even though none of the US mainstream mediabothered to report this trifling fact.For example, on March 17, 2008 the Bogotá daily El Tiempo published aphotograph, reportedly from Reyes’ laptop computer, which it said showed Reyestogether with Ecuadoran security minister Gustavo Larrea. The story was widelyreported in the mainstream US press, with the influential Miami Herald leadingthe way. However, several days later, El Tiempo had to retract the story, as theimage said to be Gustavo Larrea turned out to be none other than PatricioEtchegaray, general secretary of the Communist Party of Argentina, who said hehad had a long interview with Reyes three years earlier at a rebel camp.Furthermore, the mainstream media apparently had no issue with the fact thatthree laptop computers, along with key flash drives and external storage disks,miraculously survived unscathed a scorched-earth overkill of multiple US smartbombs dropped on less than half an acre of Ecuadoran jungle. This reminded me ofaccused 9/11 hijacker Sattam al Suqami’s passport, found intact by a fortunatepasserby in the dusty rubble of what remained of the World Trade Center, if weare to believe the 9/11 Commission.It also reminded me of the George W. Bush administration using, as irrefutableevidence, 1,000 pages of technical documents supposedly found in a stolenIranian laptop – evidence of Iranian intentions to build a nuclear weapon. Yes,I know, another lucky coincidence. Go figure. I guess the good guys are luckierthan the bad guys, whoever they are. Of course, one can think up another versionto this story, the one that has the good guys planting pre-loaded laptops withincriminating intelligence for all to see. Or am I being paranoid?But, this was different and new. I was exploring a nuclear angle, seeing thesame things from a different perspective. I knew the case information by heart,but there was something I had missed, something important that would make adifference in the way Bout’s history will be written. The more I focused, themore individual components were beginning to take on a life of their own. And avery, very scary life of their own it was, at that.On March 3, 2008, Bloomberg News, citing Colombia’s National Police CommanderOscar Naranjo, reported that “FARC was seeking to buy 50 kilos of uranium forbomb making with the aim of getting involved in international terrorism.” Couldthis have been a trial balloon for a potential casus belli that the USgovernment was hoping to use later on, in a very complicated geopolitical chessgame against Russia, China and other players? Back in March 2008, scrambling tofollow the real story and keep my eyes on the proverbial ball, I had dismissedthe uranium angle as incredible and idiotic.A March 4, 2008, Miami Herald article was headlined, “Rebel Documents Talk ofUranium Offer.” It described the FARC rebels supposed attempt to purchaseuranium that could be used for a dirty bomb. About halfway through, James Lewis,a former State Department expert on arms smuggling now with the aforementionedCenter for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, stated, “In a lotof cases involving uranium deals, somebody usually gets snookered.”Without a doubt, I was seeing a discernible pattern of news management beingaccomplished through a disingenuously thought-out and nuanced media operationusing overt and covert psychological subversion complementary to the ShadowMasters’ long-ranged agenda. Please understand, this is war, not a typical,traditional guns blazing war, but a 21st century, asymmetric war – the war ofthe Shadow Masters.Citing James Lewis, a former State Department official currently employed by thepeople who penned a report about Bout, the FARC and nuclear terrorism, and in amainstream publication like the Miami Herald, legitimizes the accusation andsilences the naysayers. Who wants to be made to look bad when your opponent indebate has the State Department and mainstream press as sources?On March 19, 2008, the Washington Times reported, “Scientists studying apurported proposal by Colombian rebels to sell uranium for about $2.5 millionper kilo say the plan sounds like a scam … Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist atHarvard’s Kennedy School of Government, and other scientists expressedskepticism about the proposal. Mr. Bunn said the e-mail [recovered on the FARCcomputer] contains ‘considerable indications that a scam of some kind wasinvolved, since the quoted price of $2.5 million per kilogram is roughly 10,000times more than natural uranium is worth,’”[emphasis added].The pattern was becoming clearer. The seed of concern is planted in the minds ofthe people by a skillfully written Washington Times article. On one level thearticle is made to put people’s minds at ease, painting the FARC as easilyfooled patsies. On a deeper level, written for the more discerning reader, themessage is quite the opposite: be afraid, be very afraid. $2.5 million per kilois the going rate for enriched, nuclear-weapons-ready, and very difficult toobtain “weapons-grade” uranium. To muddy the water even more, an additionallevel of disinformation is created when the newspaper quotes unnamed Colombianofficials who “speculated that the uranium offered by the FARC could be used tomake a so-called dirty bomb, in which conventional explosives are used to spreadradioactive debris.”On March 28, 2008, Los Angeles Times reported that although “US officialsexpressed concern over charges that the Colombian rebel group the FARC wasseeking ingredients for a radioactive dirty bomb, the material discovered thisweek poses little danger.” But two paragraphs later we read, “I think you haveto take at face value what the Colombians are saying,” quoting a senior USintelligence official who, like others, only spoke anonymously, then underlinedthe point: “There’s no reason at this point to think they’re [the Colombians]making this up.”Very subtle and very clever. Unease. Danger. We had better watch ourselves. Ifthe US government is concerned about the bad guys acquiring radioactivedirty-bomb material, we, the people, should be too. And what if the threat isgreater than we are being told? What if the bad guys already have the materialto nuke New York? After all, wasn’t it Osama bin Laden who flew those airplanesinto the Twin Towers from his five-star luxury cave in Afghanistan?Several paragraphs later, the Los Angles Times quoted Charles Ferguson, anuclear affairs specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations: “Depleteduranium is not sufficiently radioactive to be suitable for a device that couldbe used as a dirty bomb. A bomb made with depleted uranium might have panickedpeople for a little while, but the alarm wouldn’t have lasted.” Then, came hiscounterpoint. “If it were weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium, I’d befreaking out because you can make a low-yield improvised nuclear device fromthat.” This was accompanied by a proviso: “I’m not aware of any highly enricheduranium of appreciable quantities in the region of Colombia, Venezuela oranywhere else near there.”On one level, our simple minds are put at ease, but the germ of doubt and worryfor the welfare of our loved ones remains.A March 19, Washington Times article warns us that the FARC have access toenriched uranium. A March 28, Los Angeles Times article confirms our worstfears. If uranium is indeed enriched, weaponsgrade, you might as well kiss thisworld goodbye. A lever is pulled. A button is pressed. A paradigm is beingimplanted, subtly and stealthily.The Council on Foreign Relations is a cousin to the powerful Bilderberg Group.Their shared ideology is control. Not a One-World-Government type of control,but rather as a One-World-Company-Ltd. control. Who stands in the way of thismonstrous, One World Company Ltd. conglomerate? Aside from some patriots in theWest and perhaps some stubborn tribal folk still living in the remote mountainsand jungles of the world, only Russia and China. And Victor Bout is a pawn inthe play of a Russian endgame.The ubiquitous Charles Ferguson then appeared again in the WMD Insights April2008 issue restating the “company line”: “At high enrichment levels, uranium canbe used as the core of a nuclear weapon. 50 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium,which has been enriched to 80 percent or more in the fissile isotopeuranium-235, would provide enough fissile material to make an improvised nuclearexplosive, which could release as much explosive energy as the Hiroshima bomb.”Wow! Scary.Speaking at a news conference one week later, on March 10, 2008, theaforementioned Colombian National Police Commander Oscar Naranjo repeated hispart in the story, quietly informing us that additional evidence in the FARC’scomputers suggests they purchased 50 kilograms of uranium that month.The game of smoke and mirrors went on. Frank Bajan, in an article of March 5,2008 for AP, “Colombia Worried Rebels Seek Uranium,” stated cunningly, “The VicePresident of the Republic of Colombia, Francisco Santos Calderón told theAssociated Press that despite fears he expressed at the world disarmament agencyin Geneva, his government doesn’t have any indication that the FARC are seekingto build a radioactive dirty bomb.” This is a typical technique used inpsychology and intelligence operations: confirm something by outright denyingits existence.Furthermore, he reported, Santos told the 65-member United Nations Conference onDisarmament in Geneva on March 4, 2008, “To put the FARC and the word uranium inthe same sentence is to make anyone’s hair stand up.” Then more panic wasintroduced through the FBI’s two-cent’s worth of reassurance. “The FBI, whichhas an office in Bogota, also has no information or intelligence regarding theFARC attempting to use WMD, spokesman Richard Kolko said in Washington.”On March 12, 2008, an Investor’s Business Daily (IBD) editorial, “Colombia HasEarned Its Trade Pact,” stated, “FARC might have obtained enriched uranium,either to sell to other terrorists or to make a dirty bomb of its own. Computercorrespondence shows that FARC offered millions for 50 kilograms of enricheduranium to one shady figure in Bogota.”Remember the figure: 50 kilograms. It will turn out to be critical to ourunderstanding of the deception.Several paragraphs later, IBD cites Colombia’s El Espectador, stating, “Reyesmade a secret trip to Romania to scope out sellers.” Then comes the slight ofhand: “Colombia’s swift use of intelligence also may have contributed to thefall of Victor Bout, a Russian weapons trafficker whose arms sales to savageregimes made him known as the Lord of War. He was not only a FARC quartermaster.He also supplied guns to Afghanistan’s Taliban, al-Qaida in Iraq and themonstrous warlords who scourged western Africa in the 1990s.”What has just happened? An explicit connection was established between FARC,uranium, terrorism, WMDs and Victor Bout.The FARC’s second-in-command, Raul Reyes, allegedly made a secret trip toRomania to scope out sellers. Allegedly, because no proof of this trip has everbeen shown to the public. No proof of Reyes’ trip to Romania. No proof of Bout’stransgressions. Proofs of Bout’s transgressions are to be apparently revealed ina secret tribunal, which the general public will not be allowed to attend. Thisis what 21st century Empire-administered justice looks like from the outside in.We are supposed to take their word for it, just like the Thai judiciary wasasked to do with the Victor Bout extradition request.From Bout’s indictment we now know that Andrew Smulian, allegedly representingVictor Bout, tried to arrange a meeting in Romania between Bout and undercoverDEA agents posing as FARC. Do you see any relevance in the supposed “RomanianConnection”? No? Neither do I. But, the power of suggestion is such that itdoesn’t matter if Bout had nothing to do with al-Qaeda, nor does it matter thatthe supposed 200 tanks Bout apparently had delivered to the Taliban turned outto be a chimera of the mainstream press. The insinuation, the insistence, thesuggestion, the wink, the nod, the meaningful silence, the whisper, thefour-star generals and their cronies parading in front of TV cameras, likecircus performers, for the mainstream press giving us all the details of thenews they consider fit to print. Disinformation – or is it art? – taken to thenth degree.PROPAGANDA AS WAR, WAR AS PROPAGANDANewsflash: The British Government has learned that Saddam Hussein recentlysought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.Does this ring a bell? How about George W. Bush’s Niger yellowcake that wound upas pie in Collin Powell’s face? This sort of campaign has by now become rathercommonplace. In the lead-up to the first Gulf War, the “babies from incubators”stories were a hot item in newspapers across the entire planet. During theirinvasion of Kuwait, Iraqi soldiers were said to be plundering hospitals of theirincubators and viciously killing any tiny inhabitants thereof. Outrageous!Retribution! screamed the editorials. Of course, the story turned out to be acomplete fabrication, but the damage had been done. In the meantime, the tailand the dog just kept on wagging each other.How is it all done? The same way we sell soap or beer: through repetition, adnauseam. Multiple sources inject the same falsehood into the media cycle, eachphrasing it in its own manner. But the message itself, the gist never changes.Richard Dearlove, head of British MI6, in a “secret” document released by awhistleblower in the UK, described the process: “the intelligence and factsbeing fixed around the policy.”The FARC are terrorists. They kill people with guns. Who supplies the guns?Victor Bout, the bad Russkie. Now, the FARC want to kill even more people. How?By acquiring WMDs. Is that why the DEA’s first question to Bout focused on theparticular kind of cruise missiles he had allegedly sold to Iran? That’s calledsetting the markers. Once set, they are almost impossible to move. It’s likemoving a goal line in the middle of the game. The missiles in question are X-55,the Russian version of the US Tomahawk, but far more deadly, powerful andaccurate, according to a May 2009 television program about Bout on TB Centre, aRussian documentary channel.In the early twentieth century, thanks to the efforts of two men, the words“propaganda” and “war” became synonymous with one another. This was no accident.One was Walter Lippmann, the most influential political commentator of his time.The other was Edward Bernays, Sigmund Freud’s nephew and one of the founders ofthe field of public relations, i.e., opinion-manipulation techniques. In 1928,Bernays wrote in Propaganda, “It was, of course, the astounding success ofpropaganda during the [First World] War that opened the eyes of the intelligentfew in all departments of life to the possibilities of regimenting the publicmind [emphasis added]…. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastesformed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. Whateverattitude one chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that inalmost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics orbusiness, our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by arelatively small number of persons, a trifling fraction of our hundred andtwenty million [US citizens at the time], who understand the mental processesand social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires, which controlthe public mind, and who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bindand guide the world.”Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays participated in a secret study on the effectsof manipulating war information for the purposes of mobilizing mass support forthe war. The study was sponsored by the Royal Institute for InternationalAffairs, an organization interlocked with Council on Foreign Relations in theUnited States.Researchers discovered that less than 10% of people understand that the processof reasoning requires the ability to observe a problem without immediatelypassing judgment on it. Since then, the brainwashers have used this fact tocontrol war and every important issue in society in general. In 1991, over 87%of Americans wanted Saddam Hussein’s head on a platter, throwing their supportbehind the first Gulf War. That was a remarkable turn-around, considering thatin 1990, less than 10% of Americans were able to pinpoint Iraq on a map and lessthan 20% knew who Saddam was. A similarly high percentage of Spanish citizensvoted for the European Constitution, even though polls have clearly shown thatonly a tiny number of these people had actually read the document.“In this manner,” writes John Coleman in Conspirators’ Hierarchy: The Story ofthe Committee of 300, “irrationality is elevated to a high level of publicconsciousness. The manipulators then play upon this to undermine and distractthe grasp of reality governing any given situation and, the more complex theproblems of a modern industrial society became, the easier it became to bringgreater and greater distractions to bear so that what we ended up with was thatthe absolutely inconsequential opinions of masses of people, created by skilledmanipulators, assumed the position of scientific fact.”At the Tavistock Institute, Coleman says, Eric Trist and Frederick Emerydeveloped a theory of “social turbulence,” a so-called “softening up effect offuture shocks” – wherein a population could be softened up through massphenomena such as energy shortages, economic and financial collapse, orterrorist attack. “If the ‘shocks’ were to come close enough to each other andif they were delivered with increasing intensity, then it was possible to drivethe entire society into a state of mass psychosis,” claimed Trist and Emery.They also stated that “individuals would become disassociated, as they tried toflee from the terror of the shocking, emerging reality; people would withdrawinto a state of denial, retreating into popular entertainments and diversions,while being prone to outbursts of rage.”In fact, we are talking about two sides of the same coin here. On one side,guiding the covert, subtle manipulation and control of thought and humanconsciousness through the power of media. “On the other side,” wrote thepseudonymous “John Quinn” for News-Hawk online on October, 10 1999, “directlyand overtly shifting the paradigm, changing the basic concepts, widening theparameters, and changing the playing field and all the rules of play by whichsociety defines itself within an exceptionally short period of time.”Into this fray of a “changing paradigm” in modern-day thought entered thenewly-minted FARC, uranium, dirty bombs, nuclear suitcases, WMDs, unscathedlaptop computers, Russian pickle-eating arms merchants, South American andAfrican dictators and all the other potpourri of ready-made scum.Uranium. I thought back to the first months of my investigation. As it turnedout, I was dead wrong on this count. Uranium was the message. A lever pulled, amessage sent, fear level raised. These, in the end, are the most explosivecharges, allegations that the FARC intended to purchase enriched uranium for theconstruction of “dirty bombs.”Back in March 2008, I had dismissed all this as fear-mongering tactics on thepart of the US government and its Colombian surrogate, thinking that uranium wasthe slight-of-hand trick, and the real message was somewhere else. It was toosilly an angle to pursue, given that the FARC’s sophisticated arsenal consistedof highly inaccurate gas-canister bombs, mortars, heavy machine guns androcketpropelled grenades … That is until the DEA had ensnared Bout and asked hima very pointed first question – about the cruise missiles he had allegedly soldto Iran.Now, let’s get back to the 50 kilograms of uranium. Recall that Charles Fergusonsaid, “At high enrichment levels, uranium can be used as the core of a nuclearweapon. 50 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, which has been enriched to 80percent or more in the fissile isotope uranium-235, would provide enough fissilematerial to make an improvised nuclear explosive, which could release as muchexplosive energy as the Hiroshima bomb.” Sounds convincing, but what does itreally mean, and more importantly can the primitive FARC, who technologicallyspeaking are still fighting almost with sticks and stones, have access to theirown makeshift version of a nuclear weapon? Do we have reasons enough to feartheir nuclear prowess? After all, we are being subliminally beaten intosubmission by the mainstream press on this point. Dirty bomb, nuclear suitcase,weapons-grade uranium, depleted uranium, FARC, terrorism.“What does it mean?” I asked a fifty-something Spaniard in a bar in Madrid. Hewas holding court on how third-world dictators hate us for our freedom andwouldn’t hesitate to use nukes unless we do something about them.“What?” he replied.“A dirty bomb,” I said. “Is it dirty because it hasn’t been washed, or becausethe guy who uses it is dirty, or what?”“Because they fill it with other stuff,” he answered without batting an eyelash.“Like, what stuff, for example?”“Nuts and bolts. You know, like the Palestinians when they make their bombs.” Helooked around the bar for moral support. People shifted uneasily.“And a nuclear suitcase?”“It’s like in the movies. The President has a suitcase strapped to his wrist.”“How many nuclear suitcases are there?” I asked.“Two,” he said confidently. “The Americans and the Russians.”“What about the terrorists?”“That’s what I mean,” he said, raising his voice and hitting the bar top withhis hand. “Don’t give them a chance, or they will nuke us.”Do you understand? No? Neither do I. But then again, it’s not aboutunderstanding, but rather about feeling. Emotionally charged language projectedthrough TV images by telegenic teleprompter readers, four-star generals, unnamedgovernment officials, alphabetsoup agencies. Welcome to the circus.How many people really understand the terminology being bandied around? In thecase of this sort of nuclear propaganda, I’d say, surely no more than tenpercent have a rudimentary understanding, while real understanding is notpossessed by even a fraction of one percent of the populace.Dimitri Khalezov is a former Soviet nuclear intelligence officer and the authorof a soon-to-be published book on covert operations, nuclear terrorism and 9/11.He is also the specialist working for Victor Bout’s defense team who met withDerek Odney outside the US Embassy in Bangkok. He provided most of the detail inthe following over the course of a lengthy interview. My goal was to try toseparate the nuclear wheat from the chaff regarding the charges against Bout redirty bombs, nuclear terrorism, etc. At the outset I had no inkling of thebombshell Khalezov would be dropping.We began with a general discussion, distinguishing nuclear weapons fromconventional explosives and further identifying the type of nuclear weaponsunder our consideration: employing nuclear fission, rather than fusion, “atomic”bombs rather than the far-more-powerful “hydrogen” bombs, which use atomic bombsfor ignition. The power of atomic bombs is rated in kilotons, each equivalent to1000 metric tons of TNT; hydrogen bombs are rated in megatons, each equivalentto one million metric tons of TNT. The largest hydrogen bomb ever tested is saidto have gone off at 50 megatons. Fusion weaponry is simply too sophisticated,expensive, cumbersome, and perhaps even too deadly, to be useful to terrorists.Fission weapons, like atomic reactors, exploit the physical properties ofcertain isotopes of radioactive elements, such as uranium-235, which can producea cascading “chain reaction,” leading in a bomb to an enormously powerful blastwith attendant radiation, fallout, etc. Only rare and highly radioactiveisotopes of elements like uranium and plutonium will work. The prodigious energyreleased from “splitting” atoms comes from the enormous bonding force requiredto hold protons and neutrons together in their nuclei.Khalezov, adding to what Charles Ferguson had stated, quickly dismissed thenotion that the FARC or anyone else would be seeking uranium for the purpose ofbuilding a “dirty bomb”: “It is not possible to make a so-called ‘dirty bomb’from uranium, either depleted or enriched, because uranium is not a highlyradioactive material. Scary ‘dirty bombs’ are made from other, highlyradioactive isotopes – such as radioactive cobalt or radioactive cesium – bothof which are quite readily available. No one should be duped by these ravingsabout a ‘dirty bomb’ made from $2.5-million-per-kilo uranium. A discerningreader should know how to read between the lines – the FARC sought to build anatomic bomb. That is what they meant to imply.”Ferguson was correct in asserting a threshold enrichment level of 80 percenturanium-235 to make a weapon, but countries producing nuclear weapons from U-235will enrich it to 90, 95, or even 100 percent. Furthermore, the term“enrichment” is a bit misleading, as the process is one of refinement by removalof the other unwanted isotopes. This, not surprisingly, requires an extremelysophisticated industrial capacity. Then you need not only some of this enricheduranium to make a weapon, you need enough: the so-called “critical mass.”“Without critical mass,” Khalezov told me, “no nuclear explosion is possible. Toavoid a premature nuclear explosion, a critical mass of nuclear material isseparated into sub-critical masses that are kept apart. When a nuclear explosionis desired, these sub-critical masses are joined together, and the explosionfollows immediately.” On this point, he again confirmed Ferguson, specifying theamount of enriched U-235 needed to make a functional weapon as “50 to 52kilograms. In fact, the exact amount would depend on its exact level ofenrichment as well as on its exact geometrical form.”I asked Khalezov why such precise technology is required to make an atomic bomb,adding, “Why can’t a wealthy billionaire with bad intentions working out of hisfive-star Afghani cave make it?”“On paper, at least, to make such a crude charge seems easy, but it only seemsso. The problem arises when you try to join two pieces of uranium. Once you getthem close to each other, and their corresponding neutron fields overlap, a slownuclear reaction will start, instantly heating up these pieces of uranium. Sowhen you try to get them closer, they will overheat, melt, and evaporate. Youwon’t be able to actually join these two pieces together, because they willalways evaporate before you could get them to physically touch each other.Therefore, to join the two sub-critical masses of uranium into one over-criticalmass required for the nuclear explosion, they need to converge at very highspeed – 2.5 km/sec [2.5 kilometers per second, over 1.5 miles per second]. Onlythen, will you have a chance for these two pieces to join before the slownuclear reaction evaporates them.”“Can you put the 2.5 km/sec into perspective?”“Considering that the most advanced modern long-barreled antitank oranti-aircraft cannon could speed up its shell to slightly over 1.2 km/sec[slightly over .75 miles/sec], to reach speeds of 2.5 km/sec in a short barrelis quite a difficult task. Still, it is possible to achieve it, if you use,instead of ordinary gunpowder, a well-calculated combination of slow and fastexplosives. Therefore, it is possible to imagine Osama bin Laden in his famouscave in Afghanistan producing such a crude nuke – if only someone would supplyhim with over 50 kilograms of enriched uranium-235. But, by no means would suchan imaginary nuke be ‘mini.’ Osama bin Laden would need to use something like apiece of an anti-aircraft cannon’s barrel, as the Americans themselves used intheir first Hiroshima bomb. However, such a primitive nuclear charge would neverever fit into a small suitcase. In a best-case scenario, it would fit into amiddle-sized truck.”Khalezov described the effects of such a bomb: “While primitive nuclear weaponsdesigns can not achieve high yields, they could likely produce a nuclear blastof some 10-12 kilotons [of TNT], which is more than enough to level amiddle-sized town, killing nearly all its inhabitants. Just for your reference,while the officially claimed yield of the [uranium-based] Hiroshima bomb was 20kilotons, all specialists agree that it went off at only a 12- to 13-kilotonyield due to flaws in its design.”Newer nukes have used plutonium-239, with a critical mass only one-fifth that ofuranium-235. But acquiring even a small amount is quite difficult, even in adeveloped nuclear-weapons program: “Plutonium-239 can only be obtained in smallquantities from working nuclear reactors, because it is a by-product of theuranium-based nuclear reaction in such reactors. Plutonium-239 is about tentimes more expensive than uranium-235, and working reactors accumulate itsquantities very slowly – mere hundreds of grams per year. Use of plutonium-239allows manufacturing nuclear weapons that are much smaller in size thanuranium-based ones.”This naturally led to a question about a weapon we have come to hear about withgreater and greater frequency in the mainstream press, the “nuclear suitcase,”or “mini-nuke: “How difficult is it to produce a ‘mini-nuke’ of a fraction of akiloton yield?”“The term ‘mini-nuke’ is obviously an unofficial term, and probably it is notcorrect from a point of logic. It generally refers to a portable nuclear chargedesigned to explode at variable yields, as small as .01 kilotons [10 tons ofTNT] up to 1 kiloton and sometimes up to several kilotons. An actual yield isset by its end-user.“There is, however, another term – ‘micro-nuke’ – which purports to refer toeven smaller nuclear charges – topping out at around .01 kiloton. There is alsoanother term – ‘suitcase-nuke’ – which simply refers to the overall size of thefissionable material along with its ignition apparatus.“You have to understand that you have to be able to control, and not justcontrol, but precisely control the exact amount of fissionable material thatwould be involved in a chain nuclear reaction. Making a workable nuclear bomb isquite difficult, but it is much more difficult to be able to control such asmall amount of nuclear material into an actual explosion.”The critical-mass requirement dictates that mini-nukes be plutonium-based, butthis presents another hurdle in the ignition process: “The problem ofplutonium-239 is that it has a much higher reactivity than uranium-235, and youwould need speeds of about 12 km/sec [7.5 miles/sec] to actually join twosub-critical pieces of plutonium into one over-critical piece before the twopieces would be overheated and evaporated.”“What countries,” I asked, “have the level of sophistication needed tomanufacture such a weapon?”“Old nuclear players, such as the United States, France, Russia, and Israel,have the technology to manufacture a precisely wrought mini-nuclear device thatcould cause a precisely calculated mini-nuclear explosion equivalent to 0.3 to0.1 kilotons [300-100 metric tons of TNT] or even 0.01 kiloton. On the otherhand even if al-Qaeda, the Taliban, bin Laden, the FARC or some other rogueorganization were theoretically able to assemble the crudest of atomic bombs,they would never be able to achieve any level of control whatsoever over howmuch of its fissile material would really be involved in a chain nuclearreaction.“With such rudimentary conditions, the most Osama bin Laden & Company could hopefor is a nuclear explosion itself. If they get ‘lucky,’ the charge might reach12 kilotons; in case of bad luck, perhaps, 7 or 8 kilotons. They could not evendream of achieving a precisely calculated yield, such as only 1 kiloton, not tomention a fraction of it. The technology is too sophisticated, even for mostdeveloped nations in the world.”Khalezov provided additional evidence that rogue operations like al-Qaeda andthe FARC “would never be able to reach the speed of 12 km/sec required to jointwo pieces of plutonium-239.”“Plutonium-based charges,” he explained, “do not use the primitive canon-design,but use, instead, the so-called implosion scheme, where a slightly sub-criticalmass of plutonium-239 is compressed into a critical mass by well-calculatedsimultaneous explosions of conventional explosive materials, charges of whichare positioned equally around the plutonium nucleus. The plutonium nucleus isbeing compressed not from only two directions, but from every direction – wherecharges of conventional materials are positioned in a sphere around theplutonium like sections of a soccer ball. The problem of the implosion scheme isthat the implosion charges must be precisely calculated and precisely wrought –and this you can achieve in neither your kitchen, nor inside a cave inAfghanistan.“Moreover, the detonators have to be precisely synchronized, practically on amicrosecond level. Even a millisecond level synchronization is not enough,because if these implosion charges detonate even slightly asynchronously, thedetonation waves would destroy the plutonium nucleus, and the nuclear chargewould be rendered useless.“Only a few developed countries possess such precise technology, which mayenable them to produce plutonium-based nuclear weapons. And only a couple ofcountries are capable of miniaturizing these nuclear weapons to a size suitableto fit into a suitcase. To illustrate how difficult is to miniaturize such aplutonium-based charge, here is one good example. India, which embarked ondevelopment of plutonium nuclear weapons [India does not have any uranium] asearly as the beginning of the 1950s, despite its considerable financial andintellectual resources, allocated within frames of an extensive nationalprogram, was not able to come up with any really workable plutonium-basednuclear charge before the mid-’70s. And even then, their nuclear charge was farfrom being ‘mini.’ Though the actual plutonium nucleus weighed less than 10kilograms, the entire construction built around it weighed slightly overone-and-a-half tons. Even today, thirty-five years after their first successfulnuclear test, the Indians are not capable of producing a ‘mini-nuke’ – they canonly master warheads [sized] for ballistic missiles.”“If someone sincerely believes that the late Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Ladencould produce such a mini-nuke, that person might as well believe that Osama binLaden together with [Taliban leader] Mullah Omar could land on the Moon in amakeshift spaceship.”Much of this confirmed what I either knew or suspected, but I admit to beingstunned by Khalezov’s reply to what I had thought was a routine question.“In your opinion,” I asked, “has anyone ever detonated a nuclear charge otherthan the two cases of Hiroshima and Nagasaki?”“You must mean apart from nuclear testing and nuclear explosions for civilpurposes.“There are more than fifty episodes of low-yield nuclear weapons being used. Themost famous of them are, of course, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing of USMarines – which set the gold standard for future nuclear terrorism – the 1996Khobar Towers bombing in Saudi Arabia, the two nuclear bombings in Buenos Airesin 1992 and 1994, the 1992 Tarata, or ‘Miraflores,’ bombing in Lima, Peru. Notto mention the 2002 micro-nuclear blast in a Bali nightclub that was used tojustify the Iraqi adventure in search of alleged weapons of mass-destruction.“And of course, the most remarkable of all of them was the double nuclearbombing of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, which ‘strangely’occurred on an anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. If you follow the news youprobably know that the Hiroshima atomic bombing was used by Osama bin Laden inone of his sermons to justify using nuclear weapons against the US’ owncivilians – so it’s unlikely anyone could find a better way of implicatingal-Qaeda than nuking the US Embassy right on such an anniversary.“And, of course, the very El Nogal bombing in Colombia in 2003 mentioned in thesupposed Reyes laptop computer was also a nuclear bombing. Which was not thefirst nuclear bombing in Colombia, in any case – for example, there was anothernuclear bombing in November 1999 in Bogota, and it too was blamed on the FARC –with the same result as the 1992 Tarata bombing in Lima, Peru, which was blamedon the Sendero Luminoso [Shining Path] that led to the quick and imminent demiseof that formidable political movement, which after the supposed use of a nuclearweapon immediately lost support from the lower classes and was relegated to thestatus of a ‘terrorist organization.’”“Wait a moment,” I said, shaking my head. “According to the informationallegedly found on Reyes’ computer, the FARC admit to planting the 2003 car bombthat killed thirty-six at a Bogota club. Are you saying they were not behindit?”“How could they be? It was your casebook mini-nuke explosion where a typicalplutonium-based high-precision mini-nuke went off at about 0.1 kiloton [100metric tons] in TNT yield. Look at the evidence. The explosion caused a largecrater, which tells me that the nuclear charge was buried in the ground; carbombs do not dig craters, because the power of explosion goes by the way ofleast resistance – i.e. upwards and to the sides, but never downwards to dig acrater. It also caused burns along with radiation injuries to people, and friedall [nearby] electronic equipment with its electro-magnetic pulse [EMP]. For anyforensic nuclear expert, this is an unmistakable signature of a nuclearexplosion. A regular bomb, and I don’t care what you mix into it, does not burnpeople. Neither does it produce an EMP or radiation. You would be surprised ifyou reviewed contemporary newspapers where you can see such ‘nuclear’ terms as‘ground zero’ and ‘millisecond’ used in connection with the El Nogal bombing.“Besides, security specialists immediately established that the device used wasof the type used in another well-known, to specialists, nuclear bombing – thatin Oklahoma City in 1995. Don’t forget that the spot of the Oklahoma bombing wasalso immediately dubbed ‘ground zero’ – and such a nuclear term was used longbefore the 9/11, so it had nothing to do with its newer reference. It was usedin its pure former sense: ‘a hypocenter of a nuclear explosion.’“Besides, look at the damage produced by the explosion in Oklahoma, and look atthe actual properties of the explosion, which are publicly available. To beginwith, the Oklahoma bombing managed to produce a seismic signal of 3.0 on theRichter scale. This is the official number. How would a truck loaded with twotons of cheap explosives produce such a seismic signal? Do you know that theseismic signal of 3.0 corresponds to 29 tons of TNT buried deep under ground?Meaning, buried deep enough to communicate its entire explosive energy to theEarth, and nothing at all to the atmosphere. You have to understand that a truckloaded with explosives would not produce any seismic signal whatsoever, becauseits entire explosive energy would go by the way of least resistance, that is tothe atmosphere with nothing going to the Earth.“In Oklahoma, a standard mini-nuke was set to explode at 0.1 kiloton, but it wasnot buried sufficiently deep under ground. It was placed into a sewage tube infront of the building. Therefore the actual explosion was able to communicate tothe Earth approximately 30% of its entire energy – which produced the abovementioned seismic signal of 3.0, which was recorded by seismic observatories.The rest of its energy was used to dig a crater and was communicated to thetargeted building and to its surroundings, causing typical atomic damages. Ifyou look at the official description of the Oklahoma bombing and check how manyordinary structures were demolished or damaged by that explosion you would besurprised indeed. The explosion managed to collapse or damage not more and notless than 324 buildings in a sixteen-block radius. Does that look like anexplosion of two tons of fertilizer? You can’t argue against rules of elementarymathematics. The officially recorded seismic signal of 3.0 on the Richter scaleis proof that the device buried into sewage in front of the Oklahoma buildingwas not less [in explosive force] than 100 tons of TNT.“Do you think Timothy McVeigh would be able to fit 100 tons of TNT into hisRyder truck? Of course, it was a mini-nuke used in the Oklahoma bombing.Otherwise why would they call that place ‘ground zero’? And why would theyofficially indict Timothy McVeigh of using WMD against US citizens? Count one ofthe grand jury’s charges against Timothy McVeigh was “Conspiracy to use a weaponof mass destruction.” Count two: “Use of a weapon of mass destruction.” All ofthis is available in official court documents. Along with the seismic signal of3.0 as officially recorded. Don’t forget also that all electronic equipment wasfried in a certain radius around the targeted building by the electromagneticpulse of a nuclear explosion. Have you ever heard that explosions of fertilizercan fry electronics nearby? So, as long as the security officials admitted thatat El Nogal the same kind a device was used as in Oklahoma, you can draw yourown conclusions …“While early generation mini-nukes employed some uranium-238 in their design,smaller modern mini-nukes do not use any uranium at all, so nothing like thatcould be found in their residue after the explosion, but only plutonium alone.So, if you are told that a mini-nuclear explosion has been executed using thelatest generation mini-nuke, and the attack is blamed on al-Qaeda, bin Laden orHezbollah, a reasonable person should immediately understand that hisperceptions and reality are being manipulated. The same thing could be saidregarding the alleged ‘enriched uranium’ of the FARC – if there was amini-nuclear explosion and then someone tries to draw a connection between sucha plutonium-based nuclear explosion and weapons-grade uranium allegedly foundaround the FARC camp, you have to understand that someone is trying hard toinsult your intelligence.“And where on Earth would Timothy McVeigh or the FARC obtain such a mini-nuke?And even if we imagine that the FARC could somehow obtain such an unusual thing,would it be reasonable to presume that the FARC, which is a militaryorganization after all, would use it against a night club instead ofannihilating a building of the Ministry of Interior or Ministry of Defense?”I walked out of our interview deep in thought. Khalezov’s logic seemedunassailable. Few would want to argue with him, I thought. And few eversuccessfully had, as far as I was able to ascertain. It was clear to me from hisexplanations and analysis that the FARC were not behind the El Nogal bombingwhich took the lives of thirty-six innocent people. By extension, if they werenot responsible, then the information allegedly found on Raul Reyes’ computerwas a giant hoax, contrary to what the mainstream press wanted us to believe.El Nogal was most definitely a mini-nuke explosion. At least four nations,according to Dimitri Khalezov, had the technical know-how of pulling it off –the United States, Russia, France and Israel. Who did it? I don’t know. I wish Idid. But I do know who didn’t do it.Interestingly, one month after the El Nogal bombing, the Colombian Secretary ofDefense flew to Washington in search of political support and lucrative armscontracts. From Victor Bout? No, from the US government.Don’t get me wrong. The FARC are cold-blooded killers. I would love to see mostof them hang, maybe all of them. But in this case, they were being used as anextension of someone else’s agenda. Caught in the middle were the innocentpeople whose lives are so often and so easily snuffed out.Tangentially to the FARC and El Nogal, my thoughts returned to Victor Bout, X-55missiles and Iran. If we are to take the DEA at face value, Bout stands accusedof supplying strategic-weapons systems to Iran. At this point, I must concludethat God only knows how they got there and who delivered them.Bout is a pawn. The US and Russia are the big players. If Bout were somehowinvolved, it would have been on a very low level. Why? Because, it isunfathomable to imagine one individual dealing as an equal with the Iraniangovernment (or the Ukrainian government) without the full support of a large andpowerful nation in the shadows.And the Shadow Masters? Could Bout’s arrest be part of a much deeper politicalblackmail against a global power? Is that the game? If the charges of nuclearterrorism can be pinned on the FARC, and by extension on Bout, then the falloutwould severely undermine Russia’s standing in the world community, the “globalvillage.” When I asked myself shortly after his arrest whether Bout was beingused as an extension of someone else’s foreign-policy agenda, I had no idea ofthe repercussions of that question.As we go to print, Victor Bout is still awaiting the outcome of the Thaiproceedings in his prison cell. Extradition to the US, or a home-bound flight toMother Russia. Much is riding on the court’s decision. The Shadow Masters have ahigh-stakes interest in Bout’s future. He is a stepping-stone. A pawn. The gameitself is about Russia’s total destruction. The Shadow Masters feel they ownBout. They surely paid enough for propaganda to make him into a “Merchant ofDeath.” The script has been set. The play rehearsed. The leading characters havegone through their lines.Now, if only the Thai court will follow the prompter …"},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE [index_split_005.html#filepos11113]Walking out of KlongPrem prison after my umpteenth visit with Victor Bout, myview was a stark contrast with the island over 500 miles to the south where Iresided with my family. Phuket looks like paradise today, but a few years ago itwas devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami of 2004, a memory still fresh among thelocals.I jumped into a waiting taxi and before long found myself between Silom andSathorn Road, in Bangkok’s commercial business district and surrounded by thecacophony of Asia’s most vibrant city. Twenty million Bangkok natives went abouttheir lives in cars and tuk-tuks, those strange three-wheeled auto rickshaws,and on bikes, scooters and motorbikes, all with the obstinate and infuriatingrepetitiveness of peoples whose routines haven’t changed in a thousand years.Against these backdrops, I thought, what’s the life of a single man or, for thatmatter, the pretensions of the Shadow Masters.Significant numbers of Chinese have been present in Thailand for centuries. Bothcultures are history-minded, but the Chinese are the only people with acontinuous recorded chronicle of their own for twenty-five hundred years. Nopeople escape history – the Chinese are simply more aware of it than most othernations.Like most big cities, Bangkok has its ethnic enclaves. Sampeng Lane is the heartof the Chinese section of Bangkok, an old densely-populated neighborhood, wherethe dilapidated buildings, the carton-and-plywood houses are Bangkok, but thesounds and the smells are Chinese and the store signs come in two languages andtwo alphabets. The store windows seem never to lose that musty look, with lastseason’s holiday lights surrounded by Chinese dragons against red awnings andthe occasional plastic plant. The women of high-strung temperament and colorfulaprons and loud voices are talking a peculiar local dialect to their companions,a blend of Mandarin and Thai.This is another type of paradise, insofar as humanity is able to reproduce it incrowded cities. It never feels claustrophobic, despite the fact that people areall over the place, not only Chinese, but also Thais of course, and Laotians andthe poorest of the poor from Burma and Nepal, and in fact from all overSoutheast Asia. All are drawn to Bangkok by the allure of a big city,re-creating in different ways and in different places what they used to do backhome, wherever that home might have been at one time.A sharp sound to my right brought me back to Bangkok’s smoggy reality. Turningthe corner, I focused on a small cross-section of houses in front of me. From myvantage point, they appeared as a horizontal brown box contained within afloating shell. There was a continuing conversation between different materialsand different textures … smooth and rough, hard and soft. I again turned thecorner and found myself in front of a brand-new house with its fully glazedstairwell above a garden court at basement-level, where two small childrenpassed the time against the backdrop of a Chinese cemetary sitting four metersabove the rear of the house. That’s the thing about Bangkok – one moment you arestanding in front of an aluminum shack, the next in front of a $300-millionskyscraper.“Buddha is strong,” the Thais say. Their King, eternal. Their belief in both ofthem – unshakeable. The Mafias and the assassins and the ambitions of the elite,at least to the Thais, pale in comparison. Good karma is the best antidote to anassassin’s bullet. That, and the love of their King, Bhumibol Adulyadej. The manwith an unpronounceble name. How different we are as cultures. East and West.The quiet wisdom of one, the impetuousness and irrational zeal of the other,convinced that for history to favor us, we have to write the record ourselves.At Chakkrawat Street, I passed near the Grand China Princess Hotel, a favoritehangout of the Chinese triads in Bangkok. Overtaking some sausage vendors, I cutacross an alley that took me from the dilapidated shanty-town within Chinatownto the shore of Bangkok’s Chao Phraya river. The air was hot and heavy, makingmovement difficult. Thoughts clung to my forehead like beads of sweat.In a kind of drooping reverie, my mind returned to the theme of my book and tothe different characters forever locked into its two-dimensionality. AlexanderLitvinenko and Victor Bout. Boris Yeltsin and gangster oligarchs withblond-haired mistresses and Hugo Boss suits. Russian Mafia linked to enricheduranium-seeking FARC terrorists linked to the world’s biggest bogeyman, Osamabin Laden. Or has Victor Bout came along and taken bin Laden’s crown? The worldof shadows and shadow dancers, shadow players and Shadow Masters. The world ofOne World Company Limited. The world of globalization with a happy face. Theworld of an Empire. A parallel world of smoke and mirrors where reality has beensugar-coated and sold to the highest bidder.How deftly the Victor Bout story was spun into our brains. Spun, as in spin –the native language of politics. It is inherently disingenuous: based on thepremise that words are moves in a game of strategy The Shadow Masters, with deeppockets and aggressive agendas, have reshaped the debate on the fundamentalissues that affect all of us, and in the process they have made the mainstreammedia compliant partners in their mission.The rise of powerful organizations such as the Heritage Foundation, HudsonInstitute, Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Sage Foundation, Cato Institute andManhattan Institute into the role of savvy idea peddlers with millions to spendon marketing has profound implications for the future of the world. In keypolicy debates, these organizations have discredited their opponents, dominatedthe media, and engineered sweeping changes in public opinion and public policy.But none of this is being mentioned in the mainstream media, which is under thetight control of political operatives and policy launderers.For Freud’s nephew Edward Bernays, the father of the field of “publicrelations,” news was made “when reality is distilled down to the most simplifiedand dramatized form and it appeals to the instincts of the public mind. Thepublic relations counsel must create news around his ideas, isolate ideas anddevelop them into events so they can be more readily understood and so they mayclaim attention as news.”Victor Bout, a KGB-trained, amoral, gun-selling Russkie. He is a bad man. TheDEA, who are trying to apprehend this man, are good men. Never mind that boththe DEA and the CIA are eyeball-deep into the drug trade. Reality must bedistilled down to the most simplified and dramatized form for publicconsumption. Us and them. The shadows and the Shadow Masters.Never mind that in all these years of search-and-destroy against Bout, not oneshread of real evidence has been presented to the public. Never mind that. “Takeour word for it,” they say. I did, initially. And why not? How was I supposed toimagine that the entire operation against Bout was a brilliant slight of hand, agigantic conspiracy among unprincipled DEA agents, US senators, UNinvestigators, highly paid Washington spin-doctors and their mass-mediamouthpieces. If they had me convinced initially, imagine John Q. Public.The news agenda has been driven by their own pre-fabricated messages, issues andconcerns. Yes, it is elitist. And yes, it is antieverything we should believein. How is it done? By insinuating messages into the public consciousness, intothe minds of people – especially into their subconscious minds – by adopting adisinformation policy dedicated to changing people’s perceptions of reality.With the mainstream US and UK press led by the Washington Post and the BBC, andtheir sordid commentators spouting forth the most jingoistic propaganda billedas news, the publics are not being told the truth about Iraq, Afghanistan,Kosovo, Russia, the nefarious drug trade or Victor Bout.The Shadow Masters regime does not want bad news, only good news. The SovietUnion was known for a similar policy -- there was no bad news in the old Empire.Airplane crashes, earthquakes, dissidents and epidemics were never covered bythe Soviet media. The Shadow Masters-controlled media is gradually adopting thesame policy – the war in Afghanistan is not about protecting the drug trade, butis rather about bringing democracy to a God-forsaken land; the war in Kosovo hadnothing to do with taking control of the country’s most treasured naturalresources, but rather with freeing an oppressed and long-suffering people whosought self-determination and who were punished for it by the big, bad Serbs;the all-out assault on Russia must be seen in context of international communityand nation building rather than wiping out the only nation capable of destroyingthe NATO alliance ten times over; Victor Bout must be locked away forever, forhe is the worst gunrunner in the world, who managed to outwit every intelligenceagency on the planet, their spy satellites, their armies, their electronicequipment, and, without detection, single-handedly made deals on a scale unseenin the annals of history. Propaganda. Deception. Lies. Control.Back in the dark days of World War II, Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbelsunderstood this well: “Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought tothe bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them theyare being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, andexposing the country to greater danger.” It works this way in any country and atany time.In the immediate aftermath of that war, a fellow Russian émigré, VladimirNabokov, wrote one of the great dystopian novels of the twentieth century, BendSinister. In an imaginary country ruled by the Party of the Average Man, itsphilosopher protagonist is systematically destroyed by a tyrannical state “atwar with its own subjects.” Bend Sinister defends the freedom of the individualmind not only from dictatorships abroad, but from the coercion of mass culture,mass propaganda and mass mobilization at home.Yet even in his most political novel, conceived in the heat of war, Nabokovturns from the problem of the moment to the strength and mystery ofconsciousness: the power of one’s mind and heart and soul in resisting thepolitical pressure brought to bear. The novel’s own resistance, in the name ofconsciousness, is against the group thought that levels the individual humanmind.He was all too aware of the dangers inherent in group-think, like the “utopia”longed for by an obscure Soviet beaurocrat in the 1930s: “If the state is to besaved, if the nation desires to be worthy of a new robust government that canprotect its people, then everything must be changed; popular commonsense mustprevail, and simple words, intelligible to man and beast alike, and accompaniedby fit action, must be restored to power.”If we are to replace “state” with “Shadow Masters,” “nation” with “One WorldCompany Ltd,” and “people” with “interests,” a new, twenty-first century versionemerges, with its grisly echo of the torturous past. The alternative advanced bythe Shadow Masters today requires that things should be kept simple … broughtdown to the lowest common denominator. Bout is a modern day Satan, Russians areex-KGB assassins, Kosovo drug pushers and terrorists are good people who havebeen misunderstood, Litvinenko was a loyal servant of the state who becamedisillusioned with the corruption of the ex-KGB assassins, Bilderberg is aninformal meeting of private citizens concerned for the welfare of the world. AndDaniel Estulin is a conspiracy theorist, because if what he claims to be facts,were facts, they most certainly would be reported in the New York Times.Consciousness and unconsciousness. The Shadow Masters accept consciousness assomething to be handed out in small doses, to the select few willing to playalong.The credo of the Pan-World Empire zealously promoted by the Shadow Masters, thatindividual differences should be limited for the sake of some abstract “commongood” – whether it be defeating terrorism or putting up a united front against aphantom menace – is a reductio ad absurdum, and far too like Stalin’s terror,Hitler’s lunacy and any number of other smaller, more insignificant and lesslethal varieties of tyranny.Some believe that the third millennium must be the age of religion. I would sayrather that it must be the age in which we finally grow out of our need forreligion. But to cease to believe in gods is not the same thing as commencing tobelieve in nothing. To believe, we must take on the richness of man, hisexistential destiny, and not some sectarian, simplistic, visceralmillenarianism.Of all worldly powers, the only eternal power is that of thought. The ShadowMasters are more than aware of this. Take my word for it. They know that ideasare more powerful weapons than guns, fleets and bombs. In order to secureacceptance for their imperial ideas, they seek to control the way we think. Tocontrol our language and, through the language, to control us.We use words to label and help us comprehend the world around us. “At the sametime, many of the words we use are like distorting lenses,” saidnineteenth-century English jurist Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, “they make usmisperceive and hence misjudge the object we look at because of our incurablepropensity to prejudge all the great questions by stamping our prejudices uponthe language.” Bout – Merchant of Death. Litvinenko – loyal servant of the statewho became disilusioned with the corruption of the system. Osama bin Laden –terrorist who hates us for our freedom. Russia – a mafiocracy led byunscrupulous ex-KGB assassins. The New York Times – all the news that’s fit toprint. Empty slogans. Distorted meanings. Suggestion by stealth. Memory, or alack of it.Memory saves people from oblivion. The inherent danger for today’s society,however, is that its prerequisite is lacking: curiosity deriving from respectfor deeply alien cultures. As one character in Bend Sinister declares,“Curiosity … is insubordination in its purest form.” We need a healthy curiosityabout Russia, Afghanistan, China, India, Syria, Iraq, Iran. The Shadow Mastersand their enemies-on-demand.The first decade of the new millenium rushes to a close as I sit on my terraceoverlooking the Indian Ocean. I am asking myself something over and over again,making an attempt to understand what is happening to us: Where are we going asnations? As a world? What will happen to us if the Shadow Masters finally win?What is the destiny of the human race?I am convinced that truth and destiny can be fused into one. The need is for theyounger generation to step forward and take responsibility for the future of theplanet. It is not my fight. Nor is it a crusade. But the people of my generation– not all people, but many people – we instinctively knew that our parents’generation had been living a no-future fantasy. And we knew that we had to findour way out of this no-future endgame.Us and them. The rainmakers and the Shadow Masters. Either we start re-writinghistory through a great blinding light of truth – from which people stumble onlygradually, their eyes dazzled, toward more coherent attempts to understand whathappened to them – or we plunge into a new Dark Age and madness. Call it a fairytale with a twist, or a horror tale with a happy ending.Or perhaps call it a story of corrupted idealism – a pursuit of a Platonicreflection of “perfection”: an exalted dream. And since so much of what corruptsmankind is connected to the temptations that surround wealth and power, call ita very human story.History, someone said, teaches by analogy, not identity. The historicalexperience is not one of staying in the present and looking back.

It iselimination of nation-states, elimination of liberties, elimination of therights of individuals, and the creation of a One World Company Ltd. Russia, toBilderberg’s chagrin, is why the globalists are so far behind in their plans. Itis they who unleashed the alcoholic Boris Yeltsin on the world and almostsucceeded in destroying Russia back in the 1990s. Now they are back at it withtheir attempts to smear Victor Bout, laying nuclear terrorism at Bout’s, and byimplication Russia’s, feet.[images/00074.jpg]David Rockefeller “up-close and personal” during Bilderberg 2005.

He isconsidered by many to have been the driving force behind the World TradeOrganization.[images/00013.jpg]By comparison, Flemish former Belgian Prime Minister and member of the EuropeanParliament, Jean-Luc Dehaene, is a virtual nonentity: an uninspiring greytechnocrat, but useful. In Belgian political circles he is known as “theplumber,” the man who is called upon in a pinch to fix a problem.[images/00032.jpg]Beginning of country-by-country list of candidates for participation at 1996conference, sent out to the steering committee members. No one can buy his orher way into Bilderberg. Participants are invited on the strength of theirknowledge of the subjects Bilderberg finds of value to its future world plans.There would be at least another two rounds of cuts before the final list wassent out and approved by all involved. Once accepted into Bilderberg,participants never leave. They are always “welcome” and urged to network withcurrent and past members. This is one way to encourage former participants tokeep their mouths shut about what went on at a meeting.[images/00034.jpg]American Friends of Bilderberg have emerged as go-betweens for the US inviteesselected by the Bilderberg steering committee.[images/00037.jpg]Nothing is left to chance: Bilderberg is the paragon of professionalism andefficiency, as the cover letter (here and next page), the four-page conferencebrochure (p. 257) and the travel advisory form (p. 258) clearly demonstrate.[images/00039.jpg][images/00044.jpg][images/00047.jpg][images/00050.jpg]Cover letter to invitees to 1996 Bilderberg conference, with preliminary agendaon next page.

Bilderberg insiders outrank functionaries.[images/00058.jpg]Then-Bilderberg president, Lord Peter Carrington, sends warm greetings to theHonorable William Perry, thanking him for his upcoming participation inBilderberg 1996. Carrington has long been associated with Barclays Bank and theRio Tinto Group minerals conglomerate, which dominate southern Africa. AsMargaret Thatcher’s Foreign Secretary, Carrington played a dirty part inBritain’s incitement and orchestration of Serbian military aggression and crimesagainst humanity during the 1990s Balkan crises. The same “bait and switch” hadbeen practiced upon Argentina in negotiations over the Malvinas (FalklandIslands), which incited Argentina in 1982 to a futile preemptive invasion in anattempt to enforce its claim.[images/00035.jpg]Without the authorization of President Clinton, Secretary of Defense WilliamPerry would have almost certainly violated the Logan Act, passed in 1799 andlast amended in 1994, which forbids American citIzens to communicate withofficials of foreign governments or their agents “without authority of theUnited States” about “any disputes or controversies with the United States.” Hewould surely not have participated without proper authority, but why then is thecitizenry, which after all is supposedly the sovereign power, kept in the darkabout American officials’ participation in this ongoing private internationalinstitution?[images/00094.jpg]Here and following pages, the final list of Bilderberg attendees for the 1996conference in Canada. At that conference, the dissolution of Canada was again onthe table, along with the future war in Kosovo and the destruction of Russia.[images/00062.jpg][images/00065.jpg][images/00067.jpg][images/00069.jpg]After Perry’s great impact on Bilderberg attendees during the 1996 meeting inCanada, World Economic Forum president Klaus Schwab invited him to participatein its Davos meeting in late January 1997. As you can see (facing page), Perryturned him down. Compared to the importance of actions initiated at Bilderbergconferences, discussions at the annual World Economic Forums are nothing morethan ritualized debates.[images/00073.jpg][images/00076.jpg]A 13-page 1996 pre-meeting report on Russia by the assigned speaker, AndersAslund from the Carnegie Endowment for Peace.

Oh those wild andcrazy Bilderbergers![images/00149.jpg]Here and following four pages, general information for participants at the 1991conference. The primary emphasis on wearing the official photo ID “at alltimes,” and the role of “security officers” in enforcement of the rule,underlines the by-invitation-only nature of Bilderberg. Amenities of course arefirst-rate, and meals are provided, but note (p. 287) that free drinks arelimited, presumably making for more coherent discussions.[images/00167.jpg][images/00015.jpg][images/00033.jpg][images/00052.jpg]Note (top) that current British Prime Minister Gordon Brown was among those“encouraged to speak freely and without reservation” at Bilderberg 1991. Theprocedures (facing page) are intended to insure that the moderators are able tocontrol discussions considerably through their power to recognize speakers “indue course.”[images/00046.jpg]As you can see, the procedures at the Davos conferences are much less detailedthan Bilderberg’s. Note also (p. 292) the provision for private meetings ofselected participants that may conflict with conference sessions. At Bilderberg,scheduled sessions trump all other activities.[images/00086.jpg][images/00048.jpg][images/00115.jpg]With regularity, the annual general meeting of the Council on Foreign Relationstakes place in March, the annual Bilderberg conference and G8 meeting are inApril and May, the IMF/World Bank conference gathers in September. A kind ofinternational consensus emerges and is carried over from one meeting to thenext, but no one is really leading. This consensus becomes the background for G8economic communiqués, it becomes what informs the IMF when, for example, itimposes an adjustment program on Argentina, and it becomes what the US presidentproposes to Congress.At the World Economic Forums in Davos, Switzerland at the end of each January,by contrast, a plethora of who’s who debate, and are there for all to see. Noneof the discussion carries any real weight, but it does make for good publicityand provides world political and economic leaders a great photo-op. Below we seeHenry Kissinger sharing a laugh with Tony Blair. Both are war criminals. Whatmight they be laughing about? Perhaps how they conned the world and got awaywith it. These and the following photos are from Davos 2008.Shown lower left is embattled British Prime Minister, Gordon Brown. Beforesucceeding Blair as Prime Minister, Brown was the longest-serving Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in modern history, from 1997 to 2007. His term is noted for theloosening of British governmental control of the Bank of England. Despite thisboon, Bilderberg has been profoundly disappointed in Brown’s performance as PM,where he has not managed the unruly Labour Party like his predecessor. Itappears that they have decided he should be replaced, and it is unclear how longBrown will remain in office, even if Labour maintains its majority inParliament.At lower right is Jeroen van der Veer, former CEO of Royal Dutch Shell. As avertically integrated “supermajor” oil company, its operations includeexploration and production, refining and marketing, and trading and shipping,along with other energy-related projects. Shell operates in over 140 countries.Fortune magazine listed Shell as the world’s largest corporation in 2009; Forbeshad it at number two. Its 2008 revenues were slightly less than one-halftrillion dollars, dwarfing the operating budgets of most countries in which itdoes business, where Shell usually gets its way. In 1996 a number of humanrights groups sued Royal Dutch Shell over abuses, including summary execution,in Nigeria. In 2009, Shell agreed to a legal settlement of $15.5 million,without, of course, admitting any actual culpability.[images/00156.jpg]Jean Claude Trichet, European Central Bank chief. Trichet has been a member ofthe influential Group of Thirty, a Washington-based international advisory groupof bankers and academics, since 1987. In 1993 he was appointed governor of theBanque de France, and became president of the European Central Bank in 2003. Asthe European Parliament is a little more than a toothless debating society, thereal power rests with the money people: the European Central Bank, the WorldBank and the IMF, as well as the British Treasury, Bank of England and even theUS Federal Reserve. Not one of these organizations in any way represents theinterests of the people of the world. They stand with the Shadow Masters and area key part of the drive towards the creation of George Ball’s World Company.[images/00143.jpg]PepsiCo’s pride and joy, Indra Nooyi, a key player in the Bilderberg innercircle, seen here during her Davos presentation.

Kouchner is notorious for his endorsement of militaryinterventions for “humanitarian reasons.” He is also a regular at everyBilderberg conference, where “left” and “right” are but techniques of deceptionand control.[images/00162.jpg]A Russian mafia diagram of a typical opium route into Europe.

Afghanistan has joined Colombia asthe world’s major powerhouses. If NATO truly wanted to eradicate drugs, insteadof protecting their shipment, it could have interdicted the shipments and notallowed the drugs to leave. That would greatly displease the Shadow Masters. Theonly reason we have a drug problem is that governments like it that way, as itprovides enormous wealth-building opportunities in addition to a means ofmanaging the populace. US troops are dying and being maimed in the cause of thenefarious drug trade. Vietnam, Kosovo and Afghanistan all provide illustrationsof wars for drugs. The global financial system is imploding, and drug barons aremoving to take over the entire world economy.[images/00089.jpg]In July 2004, the Bush administration issued Executive Order 3348, directing theOffice of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to freeze any US assets of formerLiberian President, Charles Taylor and a number of his supposed associates,including Victor Bout (p. 305), and also forbidding American firms from doingbusiness with any of them. Bout denies any relationship with Taylor.Interestingly, Bout never had any assets in the United States, something thateveryone from President Bush to the mainstream media knew perfectly well. Notealso that the notorious Leonid Minin made the list (p. 306), probably withconsiderably more justification.[images/00095.jpg][images/00165.jpg][images/00166.jpg][images/00019.jpg][images/00098.jpg][images/00054.jpg][images/00105.jpg]Some of Bout’s air-cargo fleet, amongst them an Ilyushin-76.

Boutand his alleged accomplice, Andrew Smulian . Bout is accused of providingmaterial support to Colombian FARC terrorists, including guided ballisticmissiles. By implying Bout’s role in arming terrorists, New-World-Orderenthusiasts also implicated Russia as a potential supplier of the materiel. Thecomplaint is co-signed (top) by Assistant US Attorney, Brendan McGuire. Mcguirefailed to answer even one of more than two dozen questions I asked him about thecase. The deponent before the US Magistrate issuing the complaint was DEAspecial agent Robert Zachariasiewicz, who has been charged (along with DerekOdney, DEA station chief in Bangkok) in Thailand with Bout’s illegal arrest.Rather than face trial for what Thai judges have acknowledged to be an illegalarrest, Zachariasiewicz has left the country. The US embassy in Bangkokannounced that Derek Odney has a diplomatic passport and thus can’t be tried ina foreign court. Just in case, Odney too has left Thailand.[images/00125.jpg]A handcuffed Victor Bout being led from a Bangkok hotel room after his arrest.Over forty Thai commandoes guarded Victor Bout and Andrew Smulian. Then Smulian“somehow” escaped, and he “somehow” headed straight to the USA, where he facedfederal charges that might lead to life in prison. This is essentially theofficial account, which doesn’t merely stretch credulity: it obliterates it.[images/00127.jpg]In 2007, the Belgian court of 1st Instance passed down a “not guilty” verdict inBout’s case.

This report was added to the evidence presented against Bout in the Thaicourt. The second paragraph clearly states that Bout was charged under thecriminal code of Thailand on March 3. As Bout didn’t enter Thailand until March6, the absurdity of the charge is obvious on its face. I find it hard to believethat this can be chalked up to mere incompetence. But if not, then what?Ironically, Bout’s arrest led to Thai criminal charges for unlawful arrestagainst three US DEA officers. All three have since left the country, and,according to a submitted statement to the court by the US Embassy, the USgovernment has no idea of their whereabouts.[images/00138.jpg]The judgment of the Thai court was issued 533 days after Bout’s arrest. Itdenied the US request for extradition and ordered his release. Bout has remainedincarcerated pending a US appeal.[images/00164.jpg][images/00144.jpg][images/00031.jpg]In the event that Thai officials had bogged down in the several-hundred-pointindictment of the FARC sent by the Colombian Ministry of Foreign Affairs insupport of the US request for Bout’s extradition, this summary underlined itsmain points. In the weeks after the Thai court’s ruling, reports claimed thatthe Thai judiciary was leaning toward granting the US appeal. If so, theColombian intervention has apparently had a contrary effect, and is yet anotherbaffling event in the strange proceedings against Victor Bout, “Merchant ofDeath.”[images/00147.jpg]An excerpt from Douglas Farah’s submitted testimony before the US Housesubcommittee on the role of commodities in terrorist financing, February 16,2005, which appears to link Bout to Osama bin Laden via their supposed commoninterest in African diamonds.[images/00066.jpg]Andrew Smulian’s waiver of indictment, eliminating any need for testimony in thematter.

He hasstated on the record several times that he considers Bout a “friend andbrother.” This association with Bout has earned him considerable grief,especially after various reports labeled Air Bas to be a Victor Bout company andUN actions led to the freezing of Air Bas assets. While there is no realevidence that Air Bas was ever a Bout operation, there is no lack of evidence ofChichakli’s involvement. Note his signature on document.[images/00100.jpg][images/00157.jpg]The US has twice offered Richard Chichakli immunity from prosecution in returnfor his testimony against Victor Bout. In September 2005, an initial offer wasmade, which led to a counter offer by Chichakli to testify without immunity,leading to another offer (above), which was refused. Chichakli has redactedsensitive information that may pertain to legal proceedings involving him orVictor Bout. As you can see (right), even after renditioning him to Syria, theUS in 2008 was taking a let-bygones-be-bygones approach, offering Chichaklianother immunity agreement, which he also refused.

We know of coursethat it resulted from a sting operation that had been going on long before theattack on the FARC encampment.Here the evil Ecuadoran President Correa is linked to axis-of-evil pariah stateNorth Korea, a linkage that would also be applied to Victor Bout in alast-minute US move against him in Thailand.[images/00075.jpg]Doodles, allegedly drawn by Bout during his fateful meeting in Bangkok on March6, 2008, moments before being apprehended by Thai secret police and DEA agents.Any evidentiary value was severely compromised by the fact that the doodles bearno resemblance to any writing known to come from Bout’s own hand.

The weapons were packed into 140crates, and included surface-to-air missiles, tube launchers with computerizedweapon controls, and rocketpropelled grenades. In an the ensuing media circus inBangkok, no effort has been spared in attempting to link the seized plane toVictor Bout. The US State Department claims that the seized aircraft haspreviously been registered with three companies identified by the US TreasuryDepartment as being controlled by Bout. With the Thai appeals court only weeksaway from deciding Bout’s fate, this high-profile incident appears to have beencalculated to influence the judges’ decision. Sources, including a US StateDepartment official, have told me that the impending release of this book hashelped spur actions to both influence the Thai court’s decision and discreditthe book.[images/00064.jpg][images/00097.jpg]As much as the mainstream press tries to portray my investigative journalism asconspiracy fiction, my discussions of the Shadow Masters have been drawing fullhouses across North America, Europe and Southeast Asia. Over 400 people packedan auditorium in Bologna for my conference on Bilderberg and its historicalroots.

I urged Croatians to vote against joining the European Union:“A fascist type of assault on humanity is expressed as the elimination ofnational sovereignty through the mode of imperialist tyranny known asglobalization, which, in itself, is just another word for Empire. Is that whatyou want for your country?”[images/00136.jpg]Bilderberg has become a worldwide bestseller[images/00099.jpg]Leading mainstream periodicals and magazines are strarting to take notice.
