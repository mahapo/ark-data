[{"pageNumber":1,"pageContent":"Can’t Say No! By Richard Bandler From an interview with Richard Bandler by Ronald Amsler This is always what I hear when someone comes in saying that they are like a rug — everyone walks all over them. “I can’t say ‘no,’ no matter how hard I try.” Then I we nt: “Really?” because the minute I hear this I hear the solution. I say “Really, well tell me ‘no!’” And they say they can’t do that. And I say “Well you just did!” and then they go “Oooh!!!” “What did you think would happen if you said ‘no’ to people?” an d they said: “Well I don’t know.” “See, you said it again! Right now you are telling me you can’t say no and you just used it in a sentence.” “Well, it’s not that kind of no!” and I said “Well that’s the kind you really need. You need the kind of knowing t hat you can say yes or no because you know: one takes you one way one takes you the other but if you say you can’t say ‘no’ then I think I’ve got you right there.” I mean, to me, now tell me this is not nonsense! Because I know that people who tell me they can’t say no are saying: “No no no I can’t say no!” And that’s what I hear them saying. “No no no I can’t say no; I never say no and no one is going to make me!” To me, I say that most of my clients walk in with their own solutions. ------------ The enti re interview appears in a pdf file “Treating nonsense with nonsense — Strategies for a better life!.” Ronald Amsler, NLP Institute Zurich 1999"}]
