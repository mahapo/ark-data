Combining solid scientific evidence with stimulating insights, Joestretches the horizons of the possible by extending the boundaries of the known.He takes science more seriously than most scientists, and in this fascinatingbook, he extrapolates the most recent discoveries in epigenetics, neuralplasticity, and psychoneuroimmunology to their logical conclusion.That conclusion is an exciting one: You, and every other human being, areshaping your brain and body by the thoughts you think, the emotions you feel,the intentions you hold, and the transcendental states you experience. You Arethe Placebo invites you to harness this knowledge to create a new body and newlife for yourself.This isn’t a metaphysical proposition. Joe explains each link in the chain ofcausality that starts with a thought and ends with a biological fact, such as anincrease in the number of stem cells or immunity-conferring protein moleculescirculating in your bloodstream.The book starts with Joe’s account of an accident that shattered six of thevertebrae of his spine. Suddenly, in extremis, he was confronted with thenecessity of putting into practice what he believed in theory: that our bodiespossess an innate intelligence that includes miraculous healing power. Thediscipline he brought to the process of visualizing his spinal column rebuildingitself is a story of inspiration and determination.We’re all inspired by such stories of spontaneous remission and “miraculous”healing, yet what Joe shows us in this book is that we are all capable ofexperiencing such healing miracles. Renewal is built into the very fabric of ourbodies, and degeneration and disease are the exception, not the norm.Once we understand how our bodies renew themselves, we can start to harnessthese physiological processes intentionally, directing the hormones our cellssynthesize, the proteins they build, the neurotransmitters they produce, and theneural pathways through which they send signals. Rather than possessing a staticanatomy, our bodies are seething with change, moment by moment. Our brains areon the boil, teeming with the creation and destruction of neural connections inevery second. Joe teaches us that we can steer this process with intention,assuming the powerful position of driver of the vehicle, rather than the passiverole of passenger.The discovery that the number of connections in a neural bundle can double withrepeat stimulation revolutionized biology in the 1990s. It earned itsdiscoverer, the neuropsychiatrist Eric Kandel, a Nobel Prize. Kandel later foundthat if we don’t use neural connections, they begin to shrink in just threeweeks. In this way, we can reshape our brains via the signals we pass throughour neural network.In the same decade that Kandel and others measured neuroplasticity, otherscientists discovered that few of our genes are static. The majority of genes(estimates range from 75 to 85 percent) are turned off and on by signals fromour environment, including the environment of thoughts, beliefs, and emotionsthat we cultivate in our brains. One class of these genes, the immediate earlygenes (IEGs), takes only three seconds to reach peak expression. IEGs are oftenregulatory genes, controlling the expression of hundreds of other genes andthousands of other proteins at remote sites in our bodies. That kind ofpervasive and rapid change is a plausible explanation for some of the radicalhealings you’ll read about in these pages.Joe is one of the few science writers to fully grasp the role of emotion intransformation. Negative emotion may literally be an addiction to high levels ofour own stress hormones, like cortisol and adrenaline. Both these stresshormones and relaxation hormones like DHEA and oxytocin have set points, whichexplains why we feel uncomfortable in our skin when we think thoughts orcountenance beliefs that drive our hormonal balance outside of that comfortzone. This idea is at the very frontier of the scientific understanding ofaddictions and cravings.By changing your internal state, you can change your external reality. Joemasterfully explains the chain of events that starts with intentions originatingin the frontal lobe of your brain and then translating into chemical messengers,called neuropeptides, that send signals throughout your body, turning geneticswitches on or off. Some of these chemicals, like oxytocin, the “cuddle hormone”that’s stimulated by touch, are associated with feelings of love and trust. Withpractice, you can learn to quickly adjust your set points for stress hormonesand healing hormones.The notion that you can heal yourself by simply translating thought into emotionmight sound astounding at first. Not even Joe expected the results he began toobserve in participants attending his workshops when they fully applied theseideas: spontaneous remission of tumors, wheelchair-bound patients walking, andmigraines disappearing. With the openhearted delight and open-mindedexperimentation of a child at play, Joe began to push the envelope, wonderingjust how fast radical healing might occur if people applied the body’s placeboeffect with complete conviction. Hence, the title You Are the Placebo reflectsthe fact that it’s your own thoughts, emotions, and beliefs that are generatingchains of physiological events in your body.At times, you will feel uncomfortable reading this book. But read on. Thatdiscomfort is just your old self, protesting the inevitability of transformativechange, and your hormonal set points being disturbed. Joe reassures us thatthose feelings of discomfort may simply be the biological sensation of thedissolution of the old self.Most of us won’t have the time or inclination to understand these complexbiological processes. Here’s where this book provides a great service. Joe digsdeep into the science behind these changes to present them in an understandableand digestible way. He does the heavy lifting behind the scenes in order topresent elegant and simple explanations. Using analogies and case histories, hedemonstrates exactly how we can apply these discoveries in our daily lives andillustrates the dramatic breakthroughs in health experienced by those who takethem seriously.A new generation of researchers has coined a term for the practice Joe outlines:self-directed neuroplasticity (or SDN). The idea behind the term is that wedirect the formation of new neural pathways and the destruction of old onesthrough the quality of the experiences we cultivate. I believe that SDN willbecome one of the most potent concepts in personal transformation andneurobiology for the coming generation, and this book will be at the forefrontof that movement.In the meditation exercises in Part II [p2.html] of this book, metaphysics movesinto concrete manifestation. You can do these meditations yourself easily,experiencing firsthand the expanded possibilities of being your own placebo. Thegoal here is to change your beliefs and perceptions about your life at abiological level so that you are, in essence, loving a new future into concretematerial existence.So embark on this enchanted journey that will expand your horizons of thepossible and challenge you to embrace a radically higher level of healing andfunctioning. You have nothing to lose by throwing yourself enthusiastically intothe process and dumping the thoughts, feelings, and biological set points thathave limited your past. Believe in your ability to realize your highestpotential and take inspired action, and you will become the placebo that createsa happy and healthy future for yourself and for our planet.— Dawson Church, Ph.D.Author of The Genie in Your Genesimage [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"PREFACE [toc.html#a2]Waking Up [toc.html#a2]I never planned on doing any of this. The work I’m currently involved in as aspeaker, author, and researcher sort of found me. In order for some of us towake up, we sometimes need a wake-up call. In 1986, I got the call. On abeautiful Southern California day in April, I had the privilege of being runover by an SUV in a Palm Springs triathlon. That moment changed my life andstarted me on this whole journey. I was 23 at the time, with a relatively newchiropractic practice in La Jolla, California, and I’d trained hard for thistriathlon for months.I had finished the swimming segment and was in the biking portion of the racewhen it happened. I was coming up to a tricky turn where I knew we’d be mergingwith traffic. A police officer, with his back to the oncoming cars, waved me onto turn right and follow the course. Since I was fully exerting myself andfocused on the race, I never took my eyes off of him. As I passed two cyclistson that particular corner, a red four-wheel-drive Bronco going about 55 miles anhour slammed into my bike from behind. The next thing I knew, I was catapultedup into the air; then I landed squarely on my backside. Because of the speed ofthe vehicle and the slow reflexes of the elderly woman driving the Bronco, theSUV kept coming toward me, and I was soon reunited with its bumper. I quicklygrabbed the bumper in order to avoid being run over and to stop my body frompassing between metal and asphalt. So I was dragged down the road a bit beforethe driver realized what was happening. When she finally did abruptly stop, Itumbled out of control for about 20 yards.I can still remember the sound of the bikes whizzing by and the horrifiedscreams and profanities of the riders passing me—not knowing whether they shouldstop and help or continue the race. As I lay there, all I could do wassurrender.I would soon discover that I had broken six vertebrae: I had compressionfractures in thoracic 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 and lumbar 1 (ranging from myshoulder blades to my kidneys). The vertebrae are stacked like individual blocksin the spine, and when I hit the ground with that kind of force, they collapsedand compressed from the impact. The eighth thoracic vertebra, the top segmentthat I broke, was more than 60 percent collapsed, and the circular arch thatcontained and protected the spinal cord was broken and pushed together in apretzel-like shape. When a vertebra compresses and fractures, the bone has to gosomewhere. In my case, a large volume of shattered fragments went back toward myspinal cord. It was definitely not a good picture.As if I were in a bad dream gone rogue, I woke up the next morning with a hostof neurological symptoms, including several different types of pain; varyingdegrees of numbness, tingling, and some loss of feeling in my legs; and somesobering difficulties in controlling my movements.So after I had all the blood tests, x-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs at the hospital,the orthopedic surgeon showed me the results and somberly delivered the news: Inorder to contain the bone fragments that were now on my spinal cord, I neededsurgery to implant a Harrington rod. That would mean cutting out the back partsof the vertebrae from two to three segments above and below the fractures andthen screwing and clamping two 12-inch stainless-steel rods along both sides ofmy spinal column. Then they’d scrape some fragments off my hip bone and pastethem over the rods. It would be major surgery, but it would mean I’d at leasthave a chance to walk again. Even so, I knew I’d probably still be somewhatdisabled, and I’d have to live with chronic pain for the rest of my life.Needless to say, I didn’t like that option.But if I chose not to have the surgery, paralysis seemed certain. The bestneurologist in the Palm Springs area, who concurred with the first surgeon’sopinion, told me that he knew of no other patient in the United States in mycondition who had refused it. The impact of the accident had compressed my T-8vertebra into a wedge shape that would prevent my spine from being able to bearthe weight of my body if I were to stand up: My backbone would collapse, pushingthose shattered bits of the vertebra deep into my spinal cord, causing instantparalysis from my chest down. That was hardly an attractive option either.I was transferred to a hospital in La Jolla, closer to my home, where I receivedtwo additional opinions, including one from the leading orthopedic surgeon inSouthern California. Not surprisingly, both doctors agreed that I should havethe Harrington rod surgery. It was a pretty consistent prognosis: have thesurgery or be paralyzed, never to walk again. If I had been the medicalprofessional making the recommendation, I’d have said the same thing: It was thesafest option. But it wasn’t the option I chose for myself.Maybe I was just young and bold at that time in my life, but I decided againstthe medical model and the expert recommendations. I believe that there’s anintelligence, an invisible consciousness, within each of us that’s the giver oflife. It supports, maintains, protects, and heals us every moment. It createsalmost 100 trillion specialized cells (starting from only 2), it keeps ourhearts beating hundreds of thousands of times per day, and it can organizehundreds of thousands of chemical reactions in a single cell in everysecond—among many other amazing functions. I reasoned at the time that if thisintelligence was real and if it willfully, mindfully, and lovingly demonstratedsuch amazing abilities, maybe I could take my attention off my external worldand begin to go within and connect with it—developing a relationship with it.But while I intellectually understood that the body often has the capacity toheal itself, now I had to apply every bit of philosophy that I knew in order totake that knowledge to the next level and beyond, to create a true experiencewith healing. And since I wasn’t going anywhere and I wasn’t doing anythingexcept lying facedown, I decided on two things. First, every day I would put allof my conscious attention on this intelligence within me and give it a plan, atemplate, a vision, with very specific orders, and then I would surrender myhealing to this greater mind that has unlimited power, allowing it to do thehealing for me. And second, I wouldn’t let any thought slip by my awareness thatI didn’t want to experience. Sounds easy, right?A Radical DecisionAgainst the advice of my medical team, I left the hospital in an ambulance thatbrought me to the home of two close friends, where I stayed for the next threemonths to focus on my healing. I was on a mission. I decided that I would beginevery day reconstructing my spine, vertebra by vertebra, and I would show thisconsciousness, if it was paying attention to my efforts, what I wanted. I knewthat it would demand my absolute presence . . . that is, for me to be present inthe moment—not thinking about or regretting my past, worrying about the future,obsessing about the conditions in my external life, or focusing on my pain orsymptoms. Just as in any relationship we have with anybody, we all know whensomeone is present or not with us, right? Because consciousness is awareness,awareness is paying attention, and paying attention is being present andnoticing, this consciousness would be aware of when I was present and when Iwasn’t. I would have to be totally present when I interacted with this mind; mypresence would have to match its presence, my will would have to match its will,and my mind would have to match its mind.So for two hours twice a day, I went within and began creating a picture of myintended result: a totally healed spine. Of course, I became aware of howunconscious and unfocused I was. It’s ironic. I realized back then that whencrisis or trauma occurs, we spend too much of our attention and energy thinkingabout what we don’t want instead of what we do want. During those first severalweeks, I was guilty of this tendency on what seemed like a moment-to-momentbasis.In the middle of my meditations on creating the life I wanted with a fullyhealed spine, I would all of a sudden become aware that I’d been unconsciouslythinking about what the surgeons had told me a few weeks prior: that I wouldprobably never walk again. I would be in the midst of inwardly reconstructing myspine, and the next thing I knew I was stressing over whether I should sell mychiropractic practice. While I was step-by-step mentally rehearsing walkingagain, I would catch myself imagining what it would be like to live the rest ofmy life sitting in a wheelchair—you get the idea.So every time I lost my attention and my mind wandered to any extraneousthoughts, I would start from the beginning and do the whole scheme of imageryover again. It was tedious, frustrating, and, quite frankly, one of the mostdifficult things I’d ever done. But I reasoned that the final picture that Iwanted the observer in me to notice had to be clear, unpolluted, anduninterrupted. In order for this intelligence to accomplish what I hoped—what Iknew—it was capable of doing, from start to finish I had to stay conscious andnot go unconscious.Finally, after six weeks of battling with myself and making the effort to bepresent with this consciousness, I was able to make it through my inwardreconstruction process without having to stop and start over from the beginning.I remember the day I did it for the first time: It was like hitting a tennisball on the sweet spot. There was something right about it. It clicked. Iclicked. And I felt complete, satisfied, and whole. For the first time, I wastruly relaxed and present—in mind and body. There was no mental chatter, noanalyzing, no thinking, no obsessing, no trying; something lifted, and a kind ofpeace and silence prevailed. It was as if I no longer cared about all of thethings I should have been worried about in my past and future.And that realization solidified the journey for me, because right around thattime, as I was creating this vision of what I wanted, reconstructing myvertebrae, it started to get easier every day. Most important, I started tonotice some pretty significant physiological changes. It was in that moment thatI began to correlate what I was doing inside of me to create this change withwhat was taking place outside of me—in my body. The instant I made thatcorrelation, I paid greater attention to what I was doing and did it with moreconviction; and I did it again and again. As a result, I kept doing it with alevel of joy and inspiration instead of such a dreadful, compromised effort. Andall of a sudden, what had originally taken me two or three hours to accomplishin one session, I was able to do in a shorter period.Now, I had quite a bit of time on my hands. So I started to think about what itwould be like to see a sunset again from the water’s edge or eat lunch with myfriends at a table in a restaurant, and I thought about how I would never takeany of that for granted. In detail, I imagined taking a shower and feeling thewater on my face and body, or simply sitting up while using the toilet or takinga walk on the beach in San Diego, the wind blowing on my face. These were somethings that I had never fully appreciated before the accident, but now they hadmeaning—and I took my time to emotionally embrace them until I felt as if I werealready there.I didn’t know what I was doing at the time, but now I do: I was actuallystarting to think about all these future potentials that existed in the quantumfield, and then I was emotionally embracing each of them. And as I selected thatintentional future and married it with the elevated emotion of what it would belike to be there in that future, in the present moment my body began to believeit was actually in that future experience. As my ability to observe my desireddestiny got sharper and sharper, my cells began to reorganize themselves. Ibegan to signal new genes in new ways, and then my body really started gettingbetter faster.What I was learning is one of the main principles of quantum physics: that mindand matter are not separate elements, that our conscious and unconsciousthoughts and feelings are the very blueprints that control our destiny. Thepersistence, conviction, and focus to manifest any potential future lies withinthe human mind and within the mind of the infinite potentials in the quantumfield. Both of these minds must work together in order to bring about any futurereality that potentially already exists. I realized that in that way, we are alldivine creators, independent of race, gender, culture, social status, education,religious beliefs, or even past mistakes. I felt really blessed for the firsttime in my life.I made other key decisions about my healing as well. I set up a whole regimen(described in detail in Evolve Your Brain) that included diet, visits fromfriends who practiced energy healing, and an elaborate rehabilitation program.But nothing was more important to me during that time than getting in touch withthat intelligence within me and, through it, using my mind to heal my body.At nine and a half weeks after the accident, I got up and walked back into mylife—without having any body cast or any surgeries. I had reached full recovery.I started seeing patients again at 10 weeks and was back to training and liftingweights again, while continuing my rehabilitation, at 12 weeks. And now, almost30 years after the accident, I can honestly say that I’ve hardly ever had backpain since.Research Begins in EarnestBut that wasn’t the end of this adventure. Not surprisingly, I couldn’t go backinto my life as my same self. I was changed in many ways. I’d been initiatedinto a reality that no one I knew could really understand. I couldn’t relatewith a lot of my friends, and I certainly couldn’t return to the same life. Thethings that were once so important to me really no longer mattered. And Istarted asking big questions like “Who am I?”; “What is the meaning of thislife?”; “What am I doing here?”; “What’s my purpose?”; and “What or who is God?”I left San Diego within a short time and moved to the Pacific Northwest,eventually opening a chiropractic clinic near Olympia, Washington. But at first,I pretty much retreated from the world and studied spirituality.In time, I also became very interested in spontaneous remissions: when peoplehealed from a serious disease or condition deemed terminal or permanent, withouttraditional medical interventions like surgery or drugs. On those long, lonelynights during my recovery when I couldn’t sleep, I had made a deal with thatconsciousness that if I were ever able to walk again, I’d spend the rest of mylife investigating and researching the mind-body connection and the concept ofmind over matter. And that’s pretty much what I’ve been doing in the nearlythree decades since then.I traveled to several different countries, seeking out many people who had beendiagnosed with illnesses and treated conventionally or nonconventionally, eitherstaying the same or getting worse until, all of a sudden, they got better. Istarted interviewing these people to discover what their experiences had incommon so I could understand and document what had made them improve, because Ihad a passion to marry science with spirituality. What I found was that each ofthese miraculous cases relied on a strong element of mind.The scientist in me started getting very itchy, becoming even more inquisitive.I became re-involved in attending university classes and studying the latestresearch in neuroscience, and I advanced my postgraduate training in brainimaging, neuroplasticity, epigenetics, and psychoneuroimmunology. And I figured,now that I knew what these people had done to get better and now that I knew allabout the science of changing your mind (or at least I thought I did), I shouldbe able to reproduce it—in both sick people and people who are well who want tomake changes to support not only their health, but also their relationships,careers, families, and lives in general.I was then invited to be one of the 14 scientists and researchers featured inthe 2004 documentary film What the Bleep Do We Know!? and that movie became anovernight sensation. What the Bleep Do We Know!? invited people to question thenature of reality and then try it out in their lives to see if their observationmattered or, perhaps more accurately put, if their observation became matter.People around the world were talking about the film and the concepts itespoused. In the wake of that, my first book, Evolve Your Brain: The Science ofChanging Your Mind, was published in 2007. After Evolve Your Brain had been outfor a while, people started to ask me, “How do you do it? How do you change, andhow do you create the life you want?” It soon became the most common questionpeople asked me.So I assembled a team and started teaching workshops across the United Statesand internationally on how the brain is wired and how you can reprogram yourthinking using neurophysiological principles. At first, these workshops weremostly just a sharing of information. But people wanted more, so I addedmeditations to synergize and complement the information, giving participantspractical steps to making changes in their minds and bodies, and, as a result,changes in their lives as well. After I taught my introductory workshops indifferent parts of the world, people would then ask me, “What’s next?” So Ibegan teaching another level to the introductory workshop. After that wascompleted, more folks asked if I could teach another level, a more advancedworkshop. This continued in most of the places where I presented.I kept thinking that I was done, that I’d taught all I could teach, but peoplekept asking for more, so I’d learn more myself and then refine the presentationsand meditations. A momentum developed, and I was getting good feedback; peoplewere able to eliminate some of their self-destructive habits and lead happierlives. Even though up to this point, my associates and I had seen only smallchanges—nothing really significant—people loved the information and wanted tocontinue the practice. So I kept going where I was invited. I figured that whenthe time came that they stopped inviting me, I’d know I was done with this work.About a year and a half after our first workshop, my team and I startedreceiving several e-mails from our participants commenting on positive changesthey were experiencing from doing the meditations on a consistent basis. A floodof change began to manifest in people’s lives, and they were overjoyed. Thefeedback we received over the next year caught my attention and that of my staffas well. Our participants began reporting not only subjective changes in theirphysical health, but also improvements in objective measurements from theirmedical tests. Sometimes the tests would even come back totally normal! Thesepeople were able to reproduce the exact physical, mental, and emotional changesthat I studied, observed, and ultimately wrote about in Evolve Your Brain.This was incredibly exciting for me to witness, because I knew that anythingthat is repeatable verges on becoming a scientific law. It seemed as though manyfolks were sending us e-mails starting with the same verbiage: “You’re not goingto believe this . . .” And those changes were now more than coincidence.Then a little later that year, during each of two events in Seattle, someamazing things began to happen. At the first event, a woman with multiplesclerosis (MS), who was using a walker when she arrived, was walking unassistedby the time the workshop was over. At the second Seattle event that year,another woman, who had suffered with MS for ten years, started dancing around,declaring that the paralysis and numbness she’d experienced in her left footwere completely gone. (You’ll read more about one of these women, and otherslike them, in the chapters to come.) By demand, in 2010 I taught a moreprogressive workshop in Colorado, where people started noticing that they wereshifting their well-being right there, during the event. People stood up, tookthe microphone, and reported some pretty inspiring stories.Around this time, I was also invited to speak to a lot of business leaders aboutthe biology of change, the neuroscience of leadership, and the concept of how totransform individuals in order to transform a culture. After a keynote addressto one group, several executives approached me about adapting the ideas for acorporate model of transformation. So I created an eight-hour course that couldbe tailored for companies and organizations, and the course was so successfulthat it spawned our “30 Days to Genius” corporate program. I found myselfworking with business clients such as Sony Entertainment Network, Gallo FamilyVineyards, the telecommunications company WOW! (originally called Wide OpenWest), and many others. This led to offering private coaching for uppermanagement.The demand for our corporate programs became so great that I began training acoaching staff; I now have more than 30 active trainers, including ex-CEOs,corporate consultants, psychotherapists, attorneys, physicians, engineers, andPh.D. professionals who travel all around, teaching this model of transformationto different companies. (We now have plans to begin certifying independentcoaches in using the model of change with their own clients.) Never in mywildest dreams had I ever imagined this type of future for myself.I wrote my second book, Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself: How to Lose YourMind and Create a New One, published in 2012, to serve as a practical how-tocompanion to Evolve Your Brain. I not only explained more about the neuroscienceof change and epigenetics, but also included a four-week program withstep-by-step directions for implementing these changes, based on the workshops Iwas teaching at the time.Then I did another, more advanced event in Colorado, where we had sevenspontaneous remissions of various conditions. One woman who was living onlettuce because of severe food allergies was healed that weekend. Other peoplewere healed of gluten intolerance, celiac disease, a thyroid condition, severechronic pain, and other conditions. All of a sudden, I started seeing somereally significant changes in people’s health and in their lives, while theyretreated from their then-current reality in order to create a new one. It washappening right before my eyes.Information to TransformationThat event in Colorado in 2012 was the turning point in my career, because Icould finally see that people not only were being helped to change their senseof well-being, but now also were signaling new genes in new ways right thereduring the meditations, in real time, in big ways. In order for someone who hadbeen sick for years with a health condition like lupus to become well during aone-hour meditation, something significant must have occurred in the person’smind as well as her body. I wanted to figure out how to measure these changeswhile they were happening in the workshops so that we could see exactly what wasgoing on.So in early 2013, I offered a brand-new type of event that shot our workshops toa whole new level. For this event, which was in Arizona, I invited a team ofresearchers, including neuroscientists, technicians, and quantum physicists,with specialized instruments to join me for a four-day workshop attended by morethan 200 participants. The experts used their equipment to measure the ambientelectromagnetic field in the workshop room to see if the energy was changing asthe workshop progressed. They also measured the field of energy around theparticipants’ bodies and the energy centers of their bodies (also calledchakras) to see if they were able to influence these centers.To take these measurements, they used very sophisticated instrumentation,including electroencephalography (EEG) to gauge the brain’s electrical activity,quantitative electroencephalography (QEEG) to make a computerized analysis ofthe EEG data, heart rate variability (HRV) to document the variation in timeinterval between heartbeats and heart coherence (a heart-rhythm measurement thatreflects the communication between the heart and the brain), and gas dischargevisualization (GDV) to measure changes in bioenergetic fields.We did brain scans on many of the participants both before and after the eventso that we could see what was going on in the inner world of people’s brains,and we also randomly selected people to scan during the event to see if we couldmeasure any changes in brain patterns in real time during the three meditationsI led each day. It was a great event. A person with Parkinson’s disease nolonger had any tremors. Another person with a traumatic brain injury was healed.People with tumors in their brains and bodies found that these growths wentaway. Many individuals with arthritic pain experienced relief for the first timein years. All of these occurrences were among many other profound changes.During this amazing event, we were finally able to capture objective changes ina scientific realm of measurement and document the subjective changesparticipants reported in their health. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to saythat what we observed and recorded made history. Later in the book, I’ll showyou what you’re capable of doing, by sharing some of these stories—stories aboutordinary people doing the extraordinary.Here was my idea in developing that workshop: I wanted to give people scientificinformation and then provide them with the necessary instruction on how to applythat information so that they could achieve heightened degrees of personaltransformation. Science is, after all, the contemporary language of mysticism. Ilearned that the moment you start talking in the language of religion orculture, the moment you start quoting tradition, you divide your audiencemembers. But science unifies them and demystifies the mystical.And I discovered that if I could teach people the scientific model oftransformation (bringing in a little quantum physics to help them understand thescience of possibility); combine it with the latest information in neuroscience,neuroendocrinology, epigenetics, and psychoneuroimmunology; give them the rightkind of instruction; and provide the opportunity to apply that information, thenthey would experience a transformation. And if I could do this in a settingwhere I could measure the transformation as it was happening, then thatmeasurement of transformation would become more information that I could use toteach the participants about the transformation they had just experienced. Andwith that information, they could have another transformation, and on it goes aspeople begin to close the gap between who they think they are and who theyreally are—divine creators—making it easier for them to keep doing it. I calledthis concept “information to transformation,” and it has become my new passion.Now, I offer a 7-hour introductory online intensive, and I also personally teachabout nine or ten 3-day progressive workshops a year all around the world, plusone or two 5-day advanced workshops, where we have the aforementioned scientistscome in with their equipment to measure brain changes, changes in heartfunction, changes in genetic expression, and energetic changes in real time. Theresults are nothing short of astounding, and they form the basis of this book."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [toc.html#a3]Making Minds Matter [toc.html#a3]The incredible results I’ve seen in the advanced workshops I offer and all thescientific data that has come out of that have led me to the idea of theplacebo: how people can take a sugar pill or get a saline injection and thentheir belief in something outside of themselves makes them get better.I began to ask myself, “What if people begin to believe in themselves instead ofin something outside of themselves? What if they believe that they can changesomething inside of them and move themselves to the same state of being assomeone who’s taking a placebo? Isn’t that what our workshop participants havebeen doing in order to get better? Do people really need a pill or injection tochange their state of being? Can we teach people to accomplish the same thing byteaching them how the placebo really works?”After all, the snake-handling preacher who drinks strychnine and has nobiological effects certainly has changed his state of being, right? (You’ll readmore about this in the first chapter.) So if we can then begin to measure what’staking place in the brain and look at all this information, can we teach peoplehow to do it themselves, without relying on something outside of them—without aplacebo? Can we teach them that they are the placebo? In other words, can weconvince them that instead of investing their belief in the known, like a sugarpill or a saline injection, they can place their belief in the unknown and makethe unknown known?And really that’s what this book is about: empowering you to realize that youhave all the biological and neurological machinery to do exactly that. My goalis to demystify these concepts with the new science of the way things really areso that it is within the reach of more people to change their internal states inorder to create positive changes in their health and in their external world. Ifthat sounds too amazing to be true, then as I’ve said, toward the end of thebook you’ll see some of the research compiled from our workshops to show youexactly how it’s possible.What This Book Is Not AboutI want to take just a moment to talk about a few things that this book is notabout, to clear up any potential misconceptions right from the start. For one,you won’t read here about the ethics of using placebos in medical treatment.There’s much debate about the moral correctness of treating a patient who isn’tpart of a medical trial with an inert substance. While a discussion aboutwhether the end justifies such means may well be worthwhile in a broaderconversation about placebos, that issue is completely separate from the messagethis book aims to deliver. You Are the Placebo is about putting you in thedriver’s seat of creating your own change, not about whether or not it’s okayfor other people to trick you into it.This book is also not about denial. None of the methods you’ll read about hereinvolve denying whatever health condition you may presently have. Much to thecontrary, this book is all about transforming illness and disease. My interestis in measuring the changes people make when they move from sickness to health.Instead of being about rejecting reality, You Are the Placebo is aboutprojecting what’s possible when you step into a new reality.You’ll discover that honest feedback, in the form of medical tests, will informyou if what you’re doing is working. Once you see the effects you’ve created,you can pay attention to what you did to arrive at that end, and do it again.And if what you’re doing isn’t working, then it’s time to change it until it is.That’s combining science and spirituality. Denial, on the other hand, occurswhen you’re not looking at the reality of what’s happening within and aroundyou.This book also won’t question the efficacy of the various healing modalities.Many different modalities exist, and many of them work quite well. All of themhave some type of measurable beneficial effect in at least some people, but acomplete cataloging of these methods isn’t what I want to focus on in this book.My purpose here is to introduce you to the particular modality that has mostcaptured my attention: healing yourself through thought alone. I encourage youto continue using any and all healing modalities that work for you, be theyprescription drugs, surgery, acupuncture, chiropractic, biofeedback, therapeuticmassage, nutritional supplements, yoga, reflexology, energy medicine, soundtherapy, and so on. You Are the Placebo is not about rejecting anything exceptyour own self-imposed limitations.What’s Inside This Book?You Are the Placebo is divided into two parts:— PART I [p1.html] gives you all the detailed knowledge and backgroundinformation you need to be able to understand what the placebo effect is and howit operates in your brain and body, as well as how to create the same kind ofmiraculous changes in your own brain and body all by yourself, by thought alone.Chapter 1 [ch1.html] starts off the book by sharing some incredible storiesdemonstrating the amazing power of the human mind. Some of these tales relatehow people’s thoughts have healed them, and others show how people’s thoughtshave actually made them sick (and sometimes even hastened their death). You’llread about a man who died after hearing he had cancer, even though his autopsyrevealed that he’d been misdiagnosed; a woman plagued by depression for decadeswho improved dramatically during an antidepressant drug trial, despite the factthat she was in the group receiving a placebo; and a handful of veterans hobbledby osteoarthritis who were miraculously cured by fake knee surgery. You’ll evenread some startling stories about voodoo curses and snake handling. My purposein sharing these dramatic stories is to show the wide range of what the humanmind is capable of doing all on its own, without any help from modern medicine.And hopefully, it will lead you to the question “How is that possible?”Chapter 2 [ch2.html] gives a brief history of the placebo, tracing accounts ofrelated scientific discoveries from the 1770s (when a Viennese doctor usedmagnets to induce what he thought were therapeutic convulsions) all the waythrough the modern day, as neuroscientists solve exciting mysteries about theintricacies of how the mind works. You’ll meet a doctor who developed techniquesof hypnotism after arriving late for an appointment only to find his waitingpatient mesmerized by a lamp flame, a World War II surgeon who successfully usedsaline injections as an analgesic on wounded soldiers when he ran out ofmorphine, and early psychoneuroimmunology researchers in Japan who switchedpoison-ivy leaves with harmless leaves and found that their test group reactedmore to what they were told they were experiencing than to what they actuallydid experience.You’ll also read about how Norman Cousins laughed himself to health; how Harvardresearcher Herbert Benson, M.D., was able to reduce cardiac patients’ riskfactors for heart disease by figuring out how Transcendental Meditation worked;and how Italian neuroscientist Fabrizio Benedetti, M.D., Ph.D., primed subjectswho had been given a drug, and then switched the drug for a placebo—and watchedthe brain continue to signal the production of the same neurochemicals the drugproduced without interruption. And you’ll also read a striking new study that’sa real game changer: It shows that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients wereable to dramatically improve their symptoms by taking placebos—even though theyknew full well that the medication they were given was a placebo, not an activedrug.Chapter 3 [ch3.html] will take you through the physiology of what happens inyour brain when the placebo effect is operating. You’ll read that, in one sense,the placebo works because you can embrace or entertain a new thought that youcan be well, and then use it to replace the thought that you’ll always be sick.That means you can change your thinking from unconsciously predicting that yourfuture is your same familiar past to beginning to anticipate and expect a newpotential outcome. If you agree with this idea, then it means that you’ll haveto examine how you think, what the mind is, and how these things affect thebody.I’ll explain how as long as you’re thinking the same thoughts, they’ll lead tothe same choices, which cause the same behaviors, which create the sameexperiences, which produce the same emotions, which in turn drive the samethoughts—so that neurochemically, you stay the same. In effect, you’re remindingyourself of who you think you are. But hold on; you’re not hardwired to be thesame way for the rest of your life. I’ll then explain the concept ofneuroplasticity and how we now know that the brain is capable of changingthroughout our lives, creating new neural pathways and new connections.Chapter 4 [ch4.html] moves into a discussion of the placebo effect in the body,explaining the next step of the physiology of the placebo response. It startsout telling the story of a group of elderly men who attend a weeklong retreatset up by Harvard researchers who asked the men to pretend they were 20 yearsyounger. By the end of the week, the men had made numerous measurablephysiological changes, all turning back the clock on their bodies, and you’lllearn the secret behind how they did it.To explain that, the chapter also discusses what genes are and how they aresignaled in the body. You’ll learn how the relatively new and exciting scienceof epigenetics has basically torched the old-school idea that your genes areyour destiny, by teaching us that the mind truly can instruct new genes tobehave in new ways. You’ll discover how the body has elaborate mechanisms forturning some genes on and others off, which means that you’re not doomed toexpress whatever genes you’ve inherited. This means you can learn how to changeyour neural wiring to select new genes and create real physical changes. You’llalso read about how our bodies access stem cells—the physical matter that’sbehind many placebo-effect miracles—to make new, healthy cells in areas thathave been damaged.Chapter 5 [ch5.html] ties the previous two chapters together, explaining howthoughts change your brain and your body. It begins by asking the question “Ifyour environment changes and you then signal new genes in new ways, is itpossible to signal the new gene ahead of the changing of the actualenvironment?” I’ll then explain how you can use a technique called mentalrehearsal to combine a clear intention with an elevated emotion (to give thebody a sampling of the future experience) in order to experience the new futureevent in the present moment.The key is making your inner thoughts more real than the outer environment,because then the brain won’t know the difference between the two and will changeto look as if the event has taken place. If you’re able to do this successfullyenough times, you’ll transform your body and begin to activate new genes in newways, producing epigenetic changes—just as though the imagined future event werereal. And then you can walk right into that new reality and become the placebo.This chapter not only outlines the science behind how this happens, but alsoincludes stories of many public figures from different walks of life who haveused this technique (whether or not they were fully aware of what they weredoing at the time) to make their wildest dreams come true.Chapter 6 [ch6.html], which concentrates on the concept of suggestibility,begins with a fascinating but chilling story of how a team of researchers setout to test whether a regular, law-abiding, mentally healthy person who washighly suggestible to hypnosis could be programmed to do something he or shewould normally deem unthinkable: shoot a stranger with the intent to kill.You’ll see that people have differing degrees of suggestibility, and the moresuggestible you are, the better able you are to gain access to your subconsciousmind. This is key to understanding the placebo effect, because the consciousmind is only 5 percent of who we are. The remaining 95 percent is a set ofsubconscious programmed states in which the body has become the mind. You’lllearn that you must get beyond the analytic mind and enter into the operatingsystem of your subconscious programs if you want your new thoughts to result innew outcomes and change your genetic destiny, as well as learn how meditation isa powerful tool for doing just that. The chapter ends with a brief discussion ofdifferent brain-wave states and which are the most conducive to your becomingmore suggestible.Chapter 7 [ch7.html] is all about how attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions changeyour state of being and create your personality—your personal reality—and howyou can shift them to create a new reality. You’ll read about the power thatunconscious beliefs exert and have a chance to identify some of those beliefsyou’ve been harboring without realizing it. You’ll also read about how theenvironment and your associative memories can sabotage your ability to changeyour beliefs.I’ll explain more fully that in order for you to change your beliefs andperceptions, you must combine a clear intention with an elevated emotion thatconditions your body to believe that the future potential that you selected fromthe quantum field has already happened. The elevated emotion is vital, becauseonly when your choice carries an amplitude of energy that’s greater than thehardwired programs in your brain and the emotional addiction in your body willyou be able to change your brain’s circuitry and your body’s genetic expression,as well as recondition your body to a new mind (erasing any trace of the oldneurocircuitry and conditioning).In Chapter 8 [ch8.html], I’ll introduce you to the quantum universe, theunpredictable world of the matter and energy that make up the atoms andmolecules of everything in the universe, which turn out to really be more energy(which looks like empty space) than solid matter. The quantum model, whichstates that all possibilities exist in this present moment, is your key to usingthe placebo effect for healing, because it gives you permission to choose a newfuture for yourself and actually observe it into reality. You’ll then understandjust how possible it really is to cross the river of change and make the unknownknown.Chapter 9 [ch9.html] introduces you to three people from my workshops who havereported some truly remarkable results from using these same techniques tochange their health for the better. First, you’ll meet Laurie, who, at age 19,was diagnosed with a rare degenerative bone disease that her doctors told herwas incurable. Although the bones in Laurie’s left leg and hip suffered 12 majorfractures over several decades, leaving her dependent on crutches for gettingaround, today she walks perfectly normally, without even needing a cane. Herx-rays show no evidence of any fractures in her bones.Then I’ll introduce you to Candace, who was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease—aserious thyroid condition with a host of complications—during a time in her lifewhen she was resentful and full of rage. Candace’s doctor told her she’d have totake medication for the rest of her life, but she proved him wrong after sheeventually was able to turn her condition around. Today, Candace is totally inlove with a brand-new life and takes no medication for her thyroid, which bloodtests show is completely normal.Finally, you’ll meet Joann (the woman mentioned in the Preface), a mother offive who was a successful businesswoman and entrepreneur whom many considered asuperwoman—before she collapsed quite suddenly and was diagnosed with anadvanced form of multiple sclerosis. Joann’s condition went downhill quickly,and she was eventually unable to move her legs. When she first came to myworkshops, she made only small changes—until one day when the woman who hadn’tmoved her legs in years walked around the room, completely unassisted, afterjust one hour-long meditation!Chapter 10 [ch10.html] shares more remarkable stories from workshopparticipants, along with the brain scans that go with them. You’ll meetMichelle, who completely healed herself of Parkinson’s disease, and John, aparaplegic who stood up from his wheelchair after a meditation. You’ll read howKathy (a CEO living on the fast track) learned to find the present moment andhow Bonnie healed herself of fibroids and heavy menstrual bleeding. Finally,you’ll meet Genevieve, who went into such states of bliss in meditation thattears of joy ran down her face, and Maria, whose experience can only bedescribed as having an orgasm in her brain.I’ll show you the data my team of scientists collected from these people’s brainscans so that you can see the changes we witnessed in real time during theworkshops. The best part of all this data is that it proves you don’t have to bea monk or nun, a scholar, a scientist, or a spiritual leader to accomplishsimilar feats. You don’t need a Ph.D. or a medical degree. The folks in thisbook are ordinary people like you. After reading this chapter, you’ll understandthat what these people did is not magic or even all that miraculous; they simplylearned and applied teachable skills. And if you practice the same skills,you’ll be able to make similar changes.— PART II [p2.html] of the book is all about meditation. It includes Chapter 11[ch11.html], which outlines some simple preparation steps for meditation andgoes over specific techniques you’ll find helpful, and Chapter 12 [ch12.html],which gives you step-by-step instructions for using the meditation techniques Iteach in my workshops—the very same techniques that participants used to producethe remarkable results you’ll have read about earlier in the book.image [images/line1.jpg]I’m happy to say that although we don’t have all the answers yet aboutharnessing the power of the placebo, all sorts of people are actually usingthese ideas right now to make extraordinary changes in their lives, the kinds ofchanges that many others consider practically impossible. The techniques I sharein this book need not be limited to healing a physical condition; they can alsobe applied to improving any aspect of your life. My hope is that this book willinspire you to try these techniques, too, and to make possible in your life thesame kind of seemingly impossible changes.image [images/line.jpg]Author’s note: While the stories of the individuals in my workshops whoexperienced healing are true, their names and certain identifying details havebeen changed in this book to protect their privacy."},{"pageContent":"Part I [toc.html#a4]INFORMATION [toc.html#a4]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter One [toc.html#a5]Is It Possible? [toc.html#a5]Sam Londe, a retired shoe salesman living outside of St. Louis in the early1970s, began to have difficulty swallowing.1 [endnote.html#fn-1] He eventuallywent to see a doctor, who discovered that Londe had metastatic esophagealcancer. In those days, metastatic esophageal cancer was considered incurable; noone had ever survived it. It was a death sentence, and Londe’s doctor deliveredthe news in an appropriately somber tone.To give Londe as much time as possible, the doctor recommended surgery to removethe cancerous tissue in the esophagus and in the stomach, where the cancer hadspread. Trusting the doctor, Londe agreed and had the surgery. He came throughas well as could be expected, but things soon went from bad to worse. A scan ofLonde’s liver revealed still more bad news: extensive cancer throughout theliver’s entire left lobe. The doctor told Londe that sadly, at best, he had onlymonths to live.So Londe and his new wife, both in their 70s, arranged to move 300 miles toNashville, where Londe’s wife had family. Soon after the move to Tennessee,Londe was admitted to the hospital and assigned to internist Clifton Meador. Thefirst time Dr. Meador walked into Londe’s room, he found a small, unshaven mancurled up underneath a mound of covers, looking nearly dead. Londe was gruff anduncommunicative, and the nurses explained that he’d been like that since hisadmission a few days before.While Londe had high blood-glucose levels due to diabetes, the rest of his bloodchemistry was fairly normal except for slightly higher levels of liver enzymes,which was to be expected of someone with liver cancer. Further medicalexamination showed nothing more amiss, a blessing considering the patient’sdesperate condition. Under his new doctor’s orders, Londe begrudgingly receivedphysical therapy, a fortified liquid diet, and lots of nursing care andattention. After a few days, he grew a little stronger, and his grumpinessstarted to subside. He began talking to Dr. Meador about his life.Londe had been married before, and he and his first wife had been true soulmates. They had never been able to have children but otherwise had had a goodlife. Because they loved boating, when they retired they had bought a house by alarge man-made lake. Then late one night, the nearby earthen dam burst, and awall of water crushed their house and swept it away. Londe miraculously survivedby hanging on to some wreckage, but his wife’s body was never found.“I lost everything I ever cared for,” he told Dr. Meador. “My heart and soulwere lost in the flood that night.”Within six months of his first wife’s death, while still grieving and in thedepths of depression, Londe had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer and hadhad the surgery. It was then that he had met and married his second wife, a kindwoman who knew about his terminal illness and agreed to care for him in the timehe had left. A few months after they married, they made the move to Nashville,and Dr. Meador already knew the rest of the story.Once Londe finished the story, the doctor, amazed by what he’d just heard, askedwith compassion, “What do you want me to do for you?” The dying man thought fora while.“I’d like to live through Christmas so I can be with my wife and her family.They’ve been good to me,” he finally answered. “Just help me make it throughChristmas. That’s all I want.” Dr. Meador told Londe he would do his best.By the time Londe was discharged in late October, he was actually in much bettershape than when he had arrived. Dr. Meador was surprised but pleased by how wellLonde was doing. The doctor saw his patient about once a month after that, andeach time, Londe looked good. But exactly one week after Christmas (on NewYear’s Day), Londe’s wife brought him back to the hospital.Dr. Meador was surprised to find that Londe again looked near death. All hecould find was a mild fever and a small patch of pneumonia on Londe’s chestx-ray, although the man didn’t seem to be in any respiratory distress. All ofLonde’s blood tests looked good, and the cultures the doctor ordered for himcame back negative for any other disease. Dr. Meador prescribed antibiotics andput his patient on oxygen, hoping for the best, but within 24 hours, Sam Londewas dead.As you might assume, this story is about a typical cancer diagnosis followed byan unfortunate death from a fatal disease, right?Not so fast.A funny thing happened when the hospital performed Londe’s autopsy. The man’sliver was, in fact, not filled with cancer; he had only a very tiny nodule ofcancer in its left lobe and another very small spot on his lung. The truth is,neither cancer was big enough to kill him. And in fact, the area around hisesophagus was totally free of disease as well. The abnormal liver scan taken atthe St. Louis hospital had apparently yielded a false positive result.Sam Londe didn’t die of esophageal cancer, nor did he die of liver cancer. Healso didn’t die of the mild case of pneumonia he had when he was readmitted tothe hospital. He died, quite simply, because everybody in his immediateenvironment thought he was dying. His doctor in St. Louis thought Londe wasdying, and then Dr. Meador, in Nashville, thought Londe was dying. Londe’s wifeand family thought he was dying, too. And, most important, Londe himself thoughthe was dying. Is it possible that Sam Londe died from thought alone? Is itpossible that thought is that powerful? And if so, is this case unique?Can You Overdose on a Placebo?Twenty-six-year-old graduate student Fred Mason (not his real name) becamedepressed when his girlfriend broke up with him.2 [endnote.html#fn-2] He saw anad for a clinical trial of a new antidepressant medication and decided toenroll. He’d had a bout of depression four years previously, at which time hisdoctor prescribed the antidepressant amitriptyline (Elavil), but Mason had beenforced to stop the medication when he became excessively drowsy and developednumbness. He had felt the drug was too strong for him and now hoped the new drugwould have fewer side effects.After he’d been in the study for about a month, he decided to call hisex-girlfriend. The two of them argued on the phone, and after Mason hung up, heimpulsively grabbed his bottle of pills from the trial and swallowed all 29 thatwere left in the container, attempting suicide. He immediately repented. Runninginto the hallway of his apartment building, Mason desperately called out forhelp and then collapsed on the floor. A neighbor heard his cry and found him onthe ground.Writhing, he told his neighbor he’d made a terrible mistake, that he had takenall his pills but didn’t really want to die. When he asked the neighbor to takehim to the hospital, she agreed. When Mason got to the emergency room, he waspale and sweating, and his blood pressure was 80/40 with a pulse rate of 140.Breathing rapidly, he kept repeating, “I don’t want to die.”When the doctors examined him, they found nothing wrong other than his low bloodpressure, rapid pulse, and rapid breathing. Even so, he seemed lethargic, andhis speech was slurred. The medical team inserted an IV and hooked it up to asaline drip, took samples of Mason’s blood and urine, and asked what drug he’dtaken. Mason couldn’t remember the name.He told the doctors it was an experimental antidepressant drug that was part ofa trial. He then handed them the empty bottle, which indeed had informationabout the clinical trial printed on the label, although not the name of thedrug. There was nothing to do but wait for the lab results, monitor his vitalsigns to make sure he didn’t take a turn for the worse, and hope that thehospital staff could contact the researchers who were conducting the trial.Four hours later, after the results of the lab tests came back totally normal, aphysician who had been part of the clinical drug trial arrived. Checking thecode on the label of Mason’s empty pill bottle, the researcher looked into therecords for the trial. He announced that Mason had actually been taking aplacebo and that the pills he’d swallowed contained no drugs at all.Miraculously, Mason’s blood pressure and pulse returned to normal within a fewminutes. And as if by magic, he was no longer excessively drowsy either. Masonhad fallen victim to the nocebo: a harmless substance that, thanks to strongexpectations, causes harmful effects.Is it really possible that Mason’s symptoms had been brought on solely becausethat’s what he’d expected to happen from swallowing a huge handful ofantidepressants? Could Mason’s mind, as in the case of Sam Londe, have takencontrol of his body, driven by expectations of what seemed to be the mostprobable future scenario, to the extent that he made that scenario real? Couldthat happen even if that meant his mind would have to take control of functionsnot normally under conscious control? And if that were possible, could it alsobe true that if our thoughts can make us sick, we also have the ability to useour thoughts to make us well?Chronic Depression Magically LiftsJanis Schonfeld, a 46-year-old interior designer living in California, hadsuffered with depression since she was a teenager. She’d never sought help withthe condition until she saw a newspaper ad in 1997. The UCLA NeuropsychiatricInstitute was looking for volunteer subjects for a drug trial to test a newantidepressant called venlafaxine (Effexor). Schonfeld, whose depression hadescalated to the point where the wife and mother had actually entertainedthoughts of suicide, jumped at the chance to be part of the trial.When Schonfeld arrived at the institute for the first time, a technician hookedher up to an electroencephalograph (EEG) to monitor and record her brain-waveactivity for about 45 minutes, and not long after that, Schonfeld left with abottle of pills from the hospital pharmacy. She knew that roughly half the groupof 51 subjects would be getting the drug, and half would receive a placebo,although neither she nor the doctors conducting the study had any idea whichgroup she had been randomly assigned to. In fact, no one would know until thestudy was over. But at the time, that hardly mattered to Schonfeld. She wasexcited and hopeful that after decades of battling clinical depression, acondition that would cause her to sometimes suddenly burst into tears for noapparent reason, she might finally be getting help.Schonfeld agreed to return every week for the entire eight weeks of the study.On each occasion, she’d answer questions about how she was feeling, and severaltimes, she sat through yet another EEG. Not long after she started taking herpills, Schonfeld began feeling dramatically better for the first time in herlife. Ironically, she also felt nauseated, but that was good news because sheknew that nausea was one of the common side effects of the drug being tested.She thought that she surely must have gotten the active drug if her depressionwas lifting and she was also experiencing side effects. Even the nurse she spoketo when she returned every week was convinced Schonfeld must be getting the realthing because of the changes she was experiencing.Finally, at the end of the eight-week study, one of the researchers revealed theshocking truth: Schonfeld, who was no longer suicidal and felt like a new personafter taking the pills, had actually been in the placebo group. Schonfeld wasfloored. She was sure the doctor had made a mistake. She simply didn’t believethat she could have felt so much better after so many years of suffocatingdepression simply from taking a bottle of sugar pills. And she’d even gotten theside effects! There must have been a mix-up. She asked the doctor to check therecords again. He laughed good-naturedly as he assured her that the bottle shehad taken home with her, the bottle that had given Schonfeld her life back,indeed contained nothing but placebo pills.As she sat there in shock, the doctor insisted that just because she hadn’t beengetting any real medication, it didn’t mean that she had been imagining herdepression or her improvement; it only meant that whatever had made her feelbetter wasn’t due to Effexor.And she wasn’t the only one: The study results would soon show that 38 percentof the placebo group felt better, compared to 52 percent of the group whoreceived Effexor. But when the rest of the data came out, it was theresearchers’ turn to be surprised: The patients like Schonfeld, who had improvedon the placebos, hadn’t just imagined feeling better; they had actually changedtheir brain-wave patterns. The EEG recordings taken so faithfully over thecourse of the study showed a significant increase in activity in the prefrontalcortex, which in depressed patients typically has very low activity.3[endnote.html#fn-3]Thus the placebo effect was not only altering Schonfeld’s mind, but alsobringing about real physical changes in her biology. In other words, it wasn’tjust in her mind; it was in her brain. She wasn’t just feeling well—she waswell. Schonfeld literally had a different brain by the end of the study, withouttaking any drug or doing anything differently. It was her mind that had changedher body. More than a dozen years later, Schonfeld still felt much improved.How is it possible that a sugar pill could not only lift the symptoms ofdeep-seated depression, but also cause bona fide side effects like nausea? Andwhat does it mean that the same inert substance actually has the power to changehow brain waves fire, increasing activity in the very part of the brain mostaffected by depression? Can the subjective mind really create those kinds ofmeasurable objective physiological changes? What’s going on in the mind and inthe body that would allow a placebo to so perfectly mimic a real drug in thisway? Could the same phenomenal healing effect occur not only with chronic mentalillness, but also with a life-threatening condition such as cancer?A “Miracle” Cure: Now You See It, Now You Don’tIn 1957, UCLA psychologist Bruno Klopfer published an article in a peer-reviewedjournal telling the story of a man he referred to as “Mr. Wright,” who hadadvanced lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph glands.4 [endnote.html#fn-4] The manhad huge tumors, some as big as an orange, in his neck, groin, and armpits, andhis cancer was not responding at all to conventional treatments. He lay in hisbed for weeks, “febrile, gasping for air, completely bedridden.” His doctor,Philip West, had given up hope—although Wright himself had not. When Wrightfound out that the hospital where he was being treated (in Long Beach,California) just happened to be one of ten hospitals and research centers in thecountry that were evaluating an experimental drug extracted from horse bloodcalled Krebiozen, he got very excited. Wright unrelentingly badgered Dr. Westfor days until the physician agreed to give him some of the new remedy (eventhough Wright couldn’t officially be part of the trial, which required patientsto have at least a three-month life expectancy).Wright received his injection of Krebiozen on a Friday, and by Monday, he waswalking around, laughing, and joking with his nurses, acting pretty much like anew man. Dr. West reported that the tumors “had melted like snowballs on a hotstove.” Within three days, the tumors were half their original size. In ten moredays, Wright was sent home—he’d been cured. It seemed like a miracle.But two months later, the media reported that the ten trials showed thatKrebiozen turned out to be a dud. Once Wright read the news, became fullyconscious of the results, and embraced the thought that the drug was useless, herelapsed immediately, with his tumors soon returning. Dr. West suspected thatWright’s initial positive response was due to the placebo effect, and knowingthat his patient was terminal, he figured he had little to lose—and Wright hadeverything to gain—by testing out his theory. So the doctor told Wright not tobelieve the newspaper reports and that he’d suffered a relapse because theKrebiozen they’d given Wright was found to be part of a bad batch. What Dr. Westcalled “a new, super-refined, double-strength” version of the drug was on itsway to the hospital, and Wright could have it as soon as it arrived.In anticipation of being cured, Wright was elated, and a few days later, hereceived the injection. But this time, the syringe Dr. West used contained nodrug, experimental or not. The syringe was filled only with distilled water.Again, Wright’s tumors magically vanished. He happily returned home and did wellfor another two months, free of tumors in his body. But then the AmericanMedical Association made the announcement that Krebiozen was indeed worthless.The medical establishment had been duped. The “miracle drug” turned out to be ahoax: nothing more than mineral oil containing a simple amino acid. Themanufacturers were eventually indicted. Upon hearing the news, Wright relapsed afinal time—no longer believing in the possibility of health. He returned to thehospital hopeless and two days later was dead.Is it possible that Wright somehow changed his state of being, not once buttwice, to that of a man who simply didn’t have cancer—in a matter of days? Didhis body then automatically respond to a new mind? And could he have changed hisstate back to that of a man with cancer once he heard the drug was purported tobe worthless, with his body creating exactly the same chemistry and returning tothe familiar sickened condition? Is it possible to achieve such a newbiochemical state not only when taking a pill or getting a shot, but also whenundergoing something as invasive as surgery?The Knee Surgery That Never HappenedIn 1996, orthopedic surgeon Bruce Moseley, then of the Baylor College ofMedicine and one of Houston’s leading experts in orthopedic sports medicine,published a trial study based on his experience with ten volunteers—all men whohad served in the military and suffered from osteoarthritis of the knee.5[endnote.html#fn-5] Due to the severity of their conditions, many of these menhad a noticeable limp, walked with a cane, or needed some type of assistance toget around.The study was designed to look at arthroscopic surgery, a popular surgery thatinvolved anesthetizing the patient before making a small incision to insert afiber-optic instrument called an arthroscope, which the surgeon would use to geta good look at the patient’s joint. In the surgery, the doctor would then scrapeand rinse the joint to remove any fragments of degenerated cartilage that werethought to be the cause of the inflammation and pain. At that time, aboutthree-quarters of a million patients received this surgery every year.In Dr. Moseley’s study, two of the ten men were to be given the standardsurgery, called a debridement (where the surgeon scrapes strands of cartilagefrom the knee joint); three of them were to receive a procedure called a lavage(where high-pressured water is injected through the knee joint, rinsing andflushing out the decayed arthritic material); and five of them would receivesham surgery, in which Dr. Moseley would deftly slice through their skin with ascalpel and then just sew them back up again without performing any medicalprocedure at all. For those five men, there would be no arthroscope, no scrapingof the joint, no removal of bone fragments, and no washing—just an incision andthen stitches.The start of each of the ten procedures was exactly the same: The patient waswheeled into the operating room and given general anesthesia while Dr. Moseleyscrubbed up. Once the surgeon entered the operating theater, he would find asealed envelope waiting for him that would tell him which of the three groupsthe patient on the table had been randomly assigned to. Dr. Moseley would haveno idea what the envelope contained until he actually ripped it open.After the surgery, all ten of the patients in the study reported greatermobility and less pain. In fact, the men who received “pretend” surgery did justas well as those who’d received debridement or lavage surgery. There was nodifference in the results—even six months later. And six years later, when twoof the men who’d received the placebo surgery were interviewed, they reportedthat they were still walking normally, without pain, and had greater range ofmotion.6 [endnote.html#fn-6] They said that they could now perform all theeveryday activities that they hadn’t been able to do before the surgery, sixyears earlier. The men felt as though they’d regained their lives.Fascinated by the results, Dr. Moseley published another study in 2002 involving180 patients who were followed for two years after their surgeries.7[endnote.html#fn-7] Again, all three groups improved, with patients beginning towalk without pain or limping immediately after the surgery. But again, neitherof the two groups who actually had the surgery improved any more than thepatients who received the placebo surgery—and this held true even after twoyears.Could it be possible that these patients got better simply because they hadfaith and belief in the healing power of the surgeon, the hospital, and even inthe gleaming, modern operating room itself? Did they somehow envision a lifewith a fully healed knee, simply surrender to that possible outcome, and thenliterally walk right into it? Was Dr. Moseley, in effect, nothing more than amodern-day witch doctor in a white lab coat? And is it possible to attain thesame degree of healing when facing something more threatening, maybe somethingas serious as heart surgery?The Heart Surgery That Wasn’tIn the late 1950s, two groups of researchers conducted studies comparing thethen-standard surgery for angina to a placebo.8 [endnote.html#fn-8] This waswell before the coronary-artery bypass graft, the surgery most often used today.Back then, most heart patients received a procedure known as internal mammaryligation, which involved exposing the damaged arteries and intentionally tyingthem off. The thinking was that if surgeons blocked the blood flow in this way,it would force the body to sprout new vascular channels, increasing blood flowto the heart. The surgery was extremely successful for the huge majority ofpatients who had it, although doctors had no solid proof that any new bloodvessels were ever actually created—hence the motivation for the two studies.These groups of researchers, one in Kansas City and one in Seattle, eachfollowed the same procedure, dividing their study subjects into two groups. Onereceived the standard internal mammary ligation, and the other received a shamsurgery; the surgeons made the same small incisions into the patients’ cheststhat they made for the real surgery, exposing the arteries, but then they justsewed the patients back up, doing nothing more.The results of both studies were strikingly similar: 67 percent of the patientswho had received the actual surgery felt less pain and needed less medication,while 83 percent of those who had received the sham surgery enjoyed the samelevel of improvement. The placebo surgery had actually worked better than thereal surgery!Could it be that somehow the patients who had received the sham surgery sobelieved that they’d get better that they actually did get better—throughnothing more than holding that expectation for the best? And if that ispossible, what does that say about the effects our everyday thoughts, whetherpositive or negative, have on our bodies and our health?Attitude Is EverythingA wealth of research now exists to show that our attitude does indeed affect ourhealth, including how long we live. For example, the Mayo Clinic published astudy in 2002 that followed 447 people for more than 30 years, showing thatoptimists were healthier physically and mentally.9 [endnote.html#fn-9] Optimistliterally means “best,” suggesting that those folks focused their attention onthe best future scenario. Specifically, the optimists had fewer problems withdaily activities as a result of their physical health or their emotional state;experienced less pain; felt more energetic; had an easier time with socialactivities; and felt happier, calmer, and more peaceful most of the time. Thiscame right on the heels of another Mayo Clinic study that followed more than 800people for 30 years, showing that optimists live longer than pessimists.10[endnote.html#fn-10]Researchers at Yale followed 660 people, aged 50 and older, for up to 23 years,discovering that those with a positive attitude about aging lived more thanseven years longer than those who had a more negative outlook about growingolder.11 [endnote.html#fn-11] Attitude had more of an influence on longevitythan blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, body weight, or level ofexercise.Additional studies have looked more specifically at heart health and attitude.Around the same time, a Duke University study of 866 heart patients reportedthat those who routinely felt more positive emotions had a 20 percent greaterchance of being alive 11 years later than those who habitually experienced morenegative emotions.12 [endnote.html#fn-12] Even more striking are the results ofa study of 255 medical students at the Medical College of Georgia who werefollowed for 25 years: Those who were the most hostile had five times greaterincidence of coronary heart disease.13 [endnote.html#fn-13] And a Johns Hopkinsstudy presented at the American Heart Association’s 2001 Scientific Sessionseven showed that a positive outlook may offer the strongest known protectionagainst heart disease in adults at risk due to family history.14[endnote.html#fn-14] This study suggests that having the right attitude can workas well as or better than eating the proper diet, getting the right amount ofexercise, and maintaining the ideal body weight.How is it that our everyday mind-set—whether we’re generally more joyful andloving or more hostile and negative—can help determine how long we live? Is itpossible for us to change our current mind-set? If so, could having a newmind-set override the way our minds have been conditioned by past experiences?Or could expecting something negative to recur actually help to bring thatabout?Nauseated Before the NeedleAccording to the National Cancer Institute, a condition called anticipatorynausea occurs in about 29 percent of patients receiving chemotherapy when theyare exposed to the smells and sights that remind them of their chemotreatments.15 [endnote.html#fn-15] About 11 percent feel so sick before theirtreatments that they actually vomit. Some cancer patients start feelingnauseated in the car on the way to get chemo, before they even set foot insidethe hospital, while others throw up while still in the waiting room.A 2001 study from the University of Rochester Cancer Center published in theJournal of Pain and Symptom Management concluded that expecting nausea was thestrongest predictor that patients would actually experience it.16[endnote.html#fn-16] The researchers’ data reported that 40 percent of chemopatients who thought they would get sick—because their doctors told them thatthey probably would be sick after the treatment—went on to develop nausea beforethe treatment was even administered. An additional 13 percent who said they wereunsure of what to expect also got sick. Yet none of the patients who didn’texpect to get nauseated got sick.How can it be that some people become so convinced that they will get sick fromchemotherapy drugs that they get ill before any of the drugs are evenadministered? Is it possible that the power of their thoughts could be what’smaking them sick? And if that’s true of 40 percent of chemo patients, could italso be true that 40 percent of folks could just as easily get well by simplychanging their thoughts about what to expect about their health or from theirday? Could a single thought that a person accepts also make that person better?Digestive Difficulties DisappearNot long ago, as I was about to get off an airplane in Austin, I met a woman whowas reading a book that caught my eye. We were standing and waiting to deplane,and I saw the book sticking out of her bag; the title mentioned the word belief.We smiled at each other, and I asked her what the book was about.“Christianity and faith,” she answered. “Why do you ask?” I told her that I waswriting a new book on the placebo effect and that my book was all about belief.“I want to tell you this story,” she said. She went on to tell me that yearsago, she had been diagnosed with gluten intolerance, celiac disease, colitis,and a host of other ills, and experienced chronic pain. She’d read up on thediseases and gone to see several different health professionals for advice. Theyhad advised her to avoid certain foods and to take certain prescription drugs,which she had done, but she’d still felt pain throughout her entire body. Shealso hadn’t been able to sleep, had skin rashes and severe digestivedisturbances, and suffered from a whole list of other unpleasant symptoms. Then,years later, the woman went to see a new doctor, who decided to do some bloodtests. When the blood tests came back, all of the results were negative.“The day I found out I was really normal and there was nothing wrong with me, Ithought, I’m fine, and all my symptoms went away. I immediately felt great andcould eat whatever I wanted,” she told me with a flourish. Smiling, she added,“What do you believe about that?”If it’s true that learning new information that leads to a 180-degree turnaroundin what we believe about ourselves can actually make our symptoms disappear,what’s going on in our bodies that’s supporting that and making it happen?What’s the exact relationship between the mind and the body? Could it bepossible that those new beliefs could actually change our brains and bodychemistries, physically rewire our neurological circuitry of who we think weare, and alter our genetic expression? Could we in fact become different people?Parkinson’s vs. the PlaceboParkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder marked by the gradualdegeneration of nerve cells in the portion of the midbrain called the basalganglia, which controls body movements. The brains of those who have thisheartbreaking disease don’t produce enough of the neurotransmitter dopamine,which the basal ganglia needs for proper functioning. Early symptoms ofParkinson’s, which is currently considered incurable, include motor issues suchas muscle rigidity, tremors, and changes in gait and speech patterns thatoverride voluntary control.In one study, a group of researchers at the University of British Columbia inVancouver informed a group of Parkinson’s patients that they were going toreceive a drug that would significantly improve their symptoms.17[endnote.html#fn-17] In reality, the patients received a placebo—nothing morethan a saline injection. Even so, half of them who had no drug intervention, infact, had much better motor control after receiving the injection.The researchers then scanned the patients’ brains to get a better idea of whathad happened and found that the people who responded positively to the placebowere actually manufacturing dopamine in their brains—as much as 200 percent morethan before. To get an equivalent effect with a drug, you’d have to administerroughly a full dose of amphetamine—a mood-elevating drug that also increasesdopamine.It seemed that merely expecting to get better unleashed some previously untappedpower within the Parkinson’s patients that triggered the production of thedopamine—exactly what their bodies needed to get better. And if this is true,then what is the process by which thought alone can manufacture dopamine in thebrain? Might such a new internal state, brought on by the combination of clearintention and heightened emotional state, actually make us invincible in certainsituations, by activating our own inner storehouse of pharmaceuticals andoverriding the genetic circumstances of disease that we once considered outsideour conscious control?Of Deadly Snakes and StrychnineIn parts of Appalachia exist pockets of a 100-year-old religious ritual known assnake handling, or “taking up serpents.”18 [endnote.html#fn-18] While WestVirginia is the only state where it’s still legal, that doesn’t stop thefaithful, and local police in other states are known to turn a blind eye to thepractice. In these small and modest churches, as congregations gather for theworship service, the preacher enters carrying one or more briefcase-shapedlocked wooden boxes with hinged, clear-plastic doors perforated with air holes,and places the boxes carefully on the platform at the front of the sanctuary ormeeting room, near the pulpit. Before long, the music starts, a high-energyblend of country-and-western and bluegrass melodies with deeply religious lyricsabout salvation and the love of Jesus. Live musicians wail away on keyboards,electric guitars, and even drum sets that any teenage band would envy, while theparishioners shake tambourines as the spirit moves them. As the energy builds,the preacher might light a flame in a container on top of the pulpit and holdhis hand in the fire, allowing the flames to lick his outstretched palm beforehe picks up the container to sweep the fire slowly over his bare forearms. He’sjust getting “warmed up.”The congregants soon begin swaying and laying hands on one another, speaking intongues and jumping up and down, dancing to the music in praise of their savior.They are overcome with the spirit, what they call “being anointed.” Then it’stime for the preacher to flip open one of the locked boxes, reach a hand in, andpull out a deadly snake—usually a rattlesnake, cottonmouth, or copperhead. He,too, is dancing and working up quite a sweat as he holds the live serpent aroundits middle so that the snake’s head is frighteningly close to the preacher’s ownhead and throat.He might hold the snake high in the air before bringing it back down closer tohis body, dancing all the while, as the snake winds its lower half around hisarm and gyrates its upper half in the air in whatever manner it pleases. Thepreacher might then get a second or even a third snake from additional woodencases, and the congregants, men and women alike, might join him in handling theserpents as they feel the anointing coming over them. In some services, thepreacher might even ingest a poison, like strychnine, from a simple drinkingglass, without suffering any ill effects.Although the snake handlers do sometimes get bitten, considering the thousandsof services where feverish believers have reached into those hinged wooden boxeswithout a trace of doubt or fear, it doesn’t happen often. And even when itdoes, they don’t always die—even though they don’t rush to the hospital,preferring instead to have the congregation gather around them in prayer. Whyare these people not bitten more often? And why aren’t there more deaths whenthey do get bitten? How can they get into a state of mind where they are notafraid of such venomous creatures, whose bite is known to be deadly, and how canthat state of mind protect them?Then there are the displays of extreme strength in emergency situations, knownas “hysterical strength.” In April 2013, for example, 16-year-old Hannah Smithand her 14-year-old sister, Haylee, of Lebanon, Oregon, lifted a 3,000-poundtractor to free their father, Jeff Smith, who was trapped underneath.19[endnote.html#fn-19] And what about firewalkers—indigenous tribes practicingsacred rituals, and Westerners taking workshops—who stroll across burning coals?Or even the carnival showmen or Javanese trance dancers who feel compelled tochew and swallow glass (a disorder known as hyalophagia)?How are such seemingly superhuman feats possible, and do they have somethingvital in common? Could it be that at the height of their uncompromising belief,these people are somehow changing their bodies such that they become immune totheir environments? And can the same rock-solid belief that empowers snakehandlers and firewalkers also go the other way, causing us to harm ourselves—andeven die—without our having any awareness of what we’re doing?Victory Over VoodooIn 1938, a 60-year-old man in rural Tennessee spent four months getting sickerand sicker, before his wife brought him to a 15-bed hospital at the edge oftown.20 [endnote.html#fn-20] By this time, Vance Vanders (not his real name) hadlost more than 50 pounds and appeared to be near death. The doctor, DraytonDoherty, suspected that Vanders was suffering from tuberculosis or possiblycancer, but repeated tests and x-rays came up negative. Dr. Doherty’s physicalexamination showed nothing that could be causing Vanders’s distress. Vandersrefused to eat, so he was given a feeding tube, but he stubbornly vomitedwhatever was put down the tube. He continued to get worse, repeating theconviction that he was going to die, and eventually he was barely able to talk.The end seemed near, although Dr. Doherty still had no idea what the man’saffliction was.Vanders’s distraught wife asked to speak to Dr. Doherty privately and, swearinghim to secrecy, told him that her husband’s problem was that he’d been“voodoo’d.” It seems that Vanders, who lived in a community where voodoo was acommon practice, had had an argument with a local voodoo priest. The priest hadsummoned Vanders to the cemetery late one night, where he put a hex on the manby waving a bottle of malodorous liquid in front of Vanders’s face. The priesttold Vanders that he would soon die and that no one could save him. That was it.Vanders was convinced that his days were numbered and thus believed in a new,dismal future reality. The defeated man returned home and refused to eat.Eventually, his wife brought him to the hospital.After Dr. Doherty had heard the whole story, he came up with a rather unorthodoxplan for treating his patient. In the morning, he summoned Vanders’s family tohis bedside and told them that he was now certain that he knew how to cure thesick man. The family listened intently as Dr. Doherty spun the followingfabricated tale. He said that on the previous night, he had gone to thecemetery, where he’d tricked the voodoo priest into meeting with him anddivulging how he had voodoo’d Vanders. It hadn’t been easy, Dr. Doherty said.The priest had understandably not wanted to cooperate, although he finallyrelented once Dr. Doherty had pinned him against a tree and choked him.Dr. Doherty said that the priest had told him that he’d rubbed some lizard eggsonto Vanders’s skin and that the eggs had found their way to Vanders’s stomach,where they’d hatched. Most of the lizards had died, but a large one had survivedand was now eating Vanders’s body from the inside out. The doctor announced thatall he had to do was remove the lizard from Vanders’s body and the man would becured.He then called for the nurse, who dutifully brought a large syringe filled withwhat Dr. Doherty claimed was a powerful medicine. In truth, the syringe wasfilled with a drug that induced vomiting. Dr. Doherty carefully inspected thesyringe to make sure it was working right and then ceremoniously injected hisfrightened patient with the fluid. In a grand gesture, he left the room, notsaying another word to the stunned family.It wasn’t long before the patient began to vomit. The nurse provided a basin andVanders heaved, wailed, and retched for a time. At a point that Dr. Dohertyjudged to be near the end of the vomiting, he confidently strode back into theroom. Nearing the bedside, he reached into his black doctor’s bag and scooped upa green lizard, hiding it in his palm beyond anyone’s notice. Then just asVanders vomited again, Dr. Doherty slipped the reptile into the basin.“Look, Vance!” he immediately cried out with all the drama he could muster.“Look what has come out of you. You are now cured. The voodoo curse is lifted!”The room was buzzing. Some family members fell to the floor, moaning. Vandershimself jumped back away from the basin, in a wide-eyed daze. Within a fewminutes, he’d fallen into a deep sleep that lasted more than 12 hours.When Vanders finally awoke, he was very hungry and eagerly consumed so much foodthat the doctor feared his stomach would burst. Within a week, the patient hadregained all his weight and strength. He left the hospital a well man and livedat least another ten years.Is it possible that a man could just curl up and die simply because he thoughthe’d been hexed? Does the contemporary witch doctor, adorned with a stethoscopeand holding a prescription pad, speak with the same conviction for us as thevoodoo priest did for Vanders—and is our belief the same? And if it’s indeedtrue that a person could, on one level, just decide to die, then could it alsobe true that a person with a terminal disease could make the decision to live?Can someone permanently change his or her internal state—dropping his or heridentity as a cancer or arthritis victim or a heart patient or a person withParkinson’s—and simply walk into a healthy body just as easily as shedding oneset of clothes and donning another? In the upcoming chapters, we’ll explorewhat’s really possible and how that applies to you.image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Two [toc.html#a6]A Brief History of the Placebo [toc.html#a6]As the saying goes, desperate times call for desperate measures. WhenHarvard-educated American surgeon Henry Beecher was serving in World War II, heran out of morphine. Near the end of the war, morphine was in short supply inmilitary field hospitals, so this situation wasn’t uncommon. At the time,Beecher was about to operate on a badly wounded soldier. He was afraid thatwithout a painkiller, the soldier might go into fatal cardiovascular shock. Whathappened next astounded him.Without skipping a beat, one of the nurses filled a syringe with saline and gavethe soldier a shot, just as if she were injecting him with morphine. The soldiercalmed down right away. He reacted as though he’d actually received the drug,even though all he’d received was a squirt of saltwater. Beecher went ahead withthe operation, cutting into the soldier’s flesh, making what repairs werenecessary, and sewing him back up, all without anesthesia. The soldier feltlittle pain and did not go into shock. How could it be, Beecher wondered, thatsaltwater could stand in for morphine?After that stunning success, whenever the field hospital ran out of morphine,Beecher did the same thing again: injected saline, just as if he were injectingmorphine. The experience convinced him of the power of placebos, and when hereturned to the United States after the war, he began to study the phenomenon.In 1955, Beecher made history when he authored a clinical review of 15 studiespublished by the Journal of the American Medical Association that not onlydiscussed the huge significance of placebos, but also called for a new model ofmedical research that would randomly assign subjects to receive activemedications or placebos—what we now refer to as randomized, controlled trials—sothat this powerful placebo effect wouldn’t distort results.1[endnote.html#fna-1]The idea that we can alter physical reality through thought, belief, andexpectation alone (whether we are fully aware of what we’re doing or not)certainly didn’t start in that World War II field hospital. The Bible is filledwith stories of miraculous healings, and even in modern times, people regularlyflock to places such as Lourdes in southern France (where a 14-year-old peasantgirl named Bernadette had a vision of the Virgin Mary in 1858), leaving behindtheir crutches, braces, and wheelchairs as proof that they’ve been healed.Similar miracles also have been reported in Fátima, Portugal (where threeshepherd children saw an apparition of the Virgin Mary in 1917), and inconnection with a traveling statue of Mary carved for the 30th anniversary ofthe apparition. The statue was based on the description given by the oldest ofthe three children, who by then had become a nun, and it was blessed by PopePius XII before it was sent traveling around the world.Faith healing is certainly not confined to the Christian tradition. The lateIndian guru Sathya Sai Baba, widely considered by his followers to be anavatar—a manifestation of a deity—was known to manifest holy ash called vibhutifrom the palms of his hands. This fine gray ash has been said to have the powerto heal many physical, mental, and spiritual ills when either eaten or appliedto the skin as a paste. Tibetan lamas are also said to have healing powers,using their breath to heal by blowing on the sick.Even French and English kings reigning between the 4th and 9th centuries usedthe laying on of hands to cure their subjects. King Charles II of England wasknown to be particularly adept at this, performing the practice about 100,000times.What is it that causes such so-called miraculous events, whether the instrumentof healing is faith in a deity alone or belief in the extraordinary powers of aperson, an object, or even a place deemed sacred or holy? What is the process bywhich faith and belief can bring about such profound effects? Might how weassign meaning to a ritual—whether that ritual is saying the rosary, rubbing apinch of holy ash onto our skin, or taking a new miracle drug prescribed by atrusted physician—play a role in the placebo phenomenon? What if the internalstate of mind of the people who received these cures was influenced or alteredby the conditions in their external environment (a person, place, or thing atthe proper time) to such a degree that their new state of mind could actuallyeffect real physical changes?From Magnetism to HypnotismIn the 1770s, Viennese physician Franz Anton Mesmer made quite a name forhimself by developing and demonstrating what was considered at that time amedical model of miraculous healing. Expanding on an idea of Sir Isaac Newton’sabout the effect of planetary gravitation on the human body, Mesmer came tobelieve that the body contained an invisible fluid that could be manipulated toheal people using a force he called “animal magnetism.”His technique involved asking his patients to look deeply into his eyes beforemoving magnets over their bodies to direct and balance this magnetic fluid.Later, he found that he could wave his hands (without the magnets) to producethe same effect. Soon after each session began, his patients would starttrembling and twitching before going into convulsions that Mesmer consideredtherapeutic. Mesmer would continue the fluid balancing until they were calmagain. He used this technique to heal a variety of maladies, from seriousconditions like paralysis and convulsive disorders to more minor difficulties,such as menstrual problems and hemorrhoids.In what became his most famous case, Mesmer partially cured teenage concertpianist Maria-Theresia von Paradis of “hysterical blindness,” a psychosomaticcondition she’d had since about the age of three. She stayed in Mesmer’s homefor weeks as he worked with her and finally helped her to be able to perceivemotion and even distinguish color. But her parents were less than overjoyed byher progress, because they stood to lose a royal pension if their daughter wascured. In addition, as her sight returned, her piano playing deterioratedbecause she now was able to watch her fingers on the keyboard. Rumors, neversubstantiated, began circulating that Mesmer’s relationship to the pianist wasimproper. Her parents forcibly removed her from Mesmer’s house, her blindnessreturned, and Mesmer’s reputation diminished considerably.Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, a French aristocrat known as the Marquis dePuységur, observed Mesmer and took his ideas to the next level. Puységur wouldinduce a deep state that he called “magnetic somnambulism” (similar tosleepwalking), in which his subjects had access to deep thoughts and evenintuitions about their health and that of others. In this state, they wereextremely suggestible and would follow instructions, although they had no memoryof what happened once they came out of it. Whereas Mesmer thought that the powerwas in the practitioner over the subject, Puységur believed that the power wasin the thought of the subject (directed by the practitioner) over his or her ownbody; this was perhaps one of the first therapeutic attempts to explore themind-body relationship.In the 1800s, Scottish surgeon James Braid took the idea of mesmerism stillfurther, developing a concept he called “neurypnotism” (what we now know ashypnotism). Braid became intrigued by the idea when one day he arrived late foran appointment only to find his waiting patient calmly staring in intensefascination at the flickering flame of an oil lamp. Braid found the patient tobe in an extremely suggestible state as long as his attention remained solocked, thereby “fatiguing” certain parts of his brain.After many experiments, Braid learned to get his subjects to concentrate on asingle idea while staring at an object, which put them into a similar trancethat he felt he could use to cure their disorders, including chronic rheumatoidarthritis, sensory impairment, and the various complications of spinal injuriesand stroke. Braid’s book Neurypnology details many of his successes, includingthe story of how he cured both a 33-year-old woman whose legs were paralyzed anda 54-year-old woman with a skin disorder and severe headaches.Then esteemed French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot weighed in on Braid’s work,claiming that the ability to go into such a trance was possible only in thosesuffering from the condition of hysteria, which he considered an inheritedneurological disorder that was irreversible. He used hypnosis not to curepatients, but to study their symptoms. Finally, a rival of Charcot’s, a doctornamed Hippolyte Bernheim at the University of Nancy, insisted that thesuggestibility so central to hypnotism was not confined to hysterics but was anatural condition for all humans. He implanted ideas in subjects, telling themthat when they awoke from their trance, they would feel better and theirsymptoms would disappear; thus he used the power of suggestion as a therapeutictool. Bernheim’s work continued into the early 1900s.image [images/line1.jpg]Although each of these early explorers of suggestibility had a slightlydifferent focus and technique, they were all able to help hundreds and hundredsof people heal a wide variety of physical and mental problems by changing theirminds about their maladies and about how those illnesses were expressed in theirbodies.During the first two world wars, military doctors, most notably Armypsychiatrist Benjamin Simon, used the concept of hypnotic suggestibility (whichI’ll discuss further later) to help returning soldiers who suffered from thetrauma that was first labeled “shell shock” but is now known as post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD). These veterans had suffered through such horrible warexperiences that many of them numbed themselves to their emotions as a form ofself-preservation, developed amnesia surrounding the horrific events, or, worse,kept reliving their experiences in flashbacks—all of which can causestress-induced physical illness. Simon and his colleagues found hypnosisextremely useful for helping the veterans face their traumas and cope with themso that they wouldn’t have to resurface as anxiety and physical ailments(including nausea, high blood pressure and other cardiovascular disorders, andeven suppressed immunity). Like those practitioners in the century before them,Army doctors employing hypnosis helped their patients alter their patterns ofthinking in order to get well and reclaim their mental and physical health.These hypnosis techniques were so successful that civilian doctors also becameinterested in using suggestibility, although many did so not by putting theirpatients into a trance but by occasionally giving them sugar pills and otherplacebos and telling them that these “drugs” would make them better. Thepatients often did get better, responding to suggestibility in the same way thatBeecher’s wounded soldiers responded to the belief that they were receivingshots of morphine. This was, in fact, Beecher’s era, and after he wrote hisgroundbreaking 1955 review calling for the use of randomized, controlled trialswith placebos for testing drugs, the placebo became a serious part of medicalresearch.Beecher’s point was well taken. Initially, researchers expected that a study’scontrol group (the group taking the placebo) would remain neutral so thatcomparisons between the control group and the group taking the active treatmentwould show how well the active treatment worked. But in so many studies, thecontrol group was indeed getting better—not just on their own but because oftheir expectation and belief that they might be taking a drug or receiving atreatment that would help them. The placebo itself might have been inert, butits effect was certainly not, and these beliefs and expectations were proving tobe extremely powerful! So somehow, that effect had to be teased out from thedata if that data was to have any real meaning.To that end, and heeding Beecher’s petition, researchers began making therandomized, double-blind trial the norm, randomly assigning subjects to eitherthe active or the placebo group and making sure none of the subjects or any ofthe researchers themselves knew who was taking the real drug and who was takingthe placebo. This way, the placebo effect would be equally active in each group,and any possibility that the researchers might treat subjects differentlyaccording to what group they were in would be eliminated. (These days, studiesare sometimes even triple blind, meaning that not only are the participants andthe researchers who are conducting the trial in the dark about who’s taking whatuntil the end of the study, but the statisticians analyzing the data also don’tknow until their job is done.)Exploring the Nocebo EffectOf course, there’s always a flip side. While suggestibility was garnering moreattention because of its ability to heal, it also became apparent that the samephenomenon could be used to harm. Such practices as hexes and voodoo cursesillustrated the negative side of suggestibility.In the 1940s, Harvard physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon (who had in 1932coined the term fight or flight) studied the ultimate nocebo response—aphenomenon that he called “voodoo death.”2 [endnote.html#fna-2] Cannon examineda number of anecdotal reports of people with strong cultural beliefs in thepower of witch doctors or voodoo priests suddenly falling ill and dying—despiteno apparent injury or evidence of poison or infection—after ending up on thereceiving end of a hex or curse. His research laid the groundwork for much ofwhat we know today about how physiological response systems enable emotions(fear in particular) to create illness. The victim’s belief in the power of thecurse itself to kill him was only part of the psychological soup that broughtabout his ultimate demise, Cannon said. Another factor was the effect of beingsocially ostracized and rejected, even by the victim’s own family. Such peoplequickly became the walking dead.Harmful effects from harmless sources aren’t restricted to voodoo, of course.Scientists in the 1960s coined the term nocebo (Latin for “I shall harm,” asopposed to “I shall please,” the Latin translation of placebo), referring to aninert substance that causes a harmful effect—simply because someone believes orexpects it will harm her.3 [endnote.html#fna-3] The nocebo effect commonly popsup in drug studies when subjects who are taking placebos either just expect thatthere will be side effects to the drug being tested, or when the subjects arespecifically warned of potential side effects—and then they experience thosesame side effects by associating the thought of the drug with all of thepotential causations, even though they’ve not taken the drug.For obvious ethical reasons, few studies are designed specifically to look atthis phenomenon, although some do exist. A famous example is a 1962 study donein Japan with a group of children who were all extremely allergic to poisonivy.4 [endnote.html#fna-4] Researchers rubbed one forearm of each child with apoison-ivy leaf but told them the leaf was harmless. As a control, they rubbedthe child’s other forearm with a harmless leaf that they claimed was poison ivy.All the children developed a rash on the arm rubbed with the harmless leaf thatwas thought to be poison ivy. And 11 of the 13 children developed no rash at allwhere the poison had actually touched them.This was an astounding finding; how could children who were highly allergic topoison ivy not get a rash when exposed to it? And how could they develop a rashfrom a totally benign leaf? The new thought that the leaf wouldn’t hurt themoverrode their memory and belief that they were allergic to it, rendering realpoison ivy harmless. And the reverse was true in the second part of theexperiment: A harmless leaf was made toxic by thought alone. In both cases, itseemed as if the children’s bodies instantaneously responded to a new mind.In this instance, we could say that the children were somehow freed from thefuture expectation of a physical reaction to the toxic leaf, based on their pastexperiences of being allergic. In effect, they somehow transcended a predictableline of time. This also suggests that by some means, they became greater thanthe conditions in their environment (the poison-ivy leaf). Finally, the childrenwere able to alter and control their physiology by simply changing a thought.This astonishing evidence that thought (in the form of expectation) could have agreater effect on the body than the “real” physical environment helped to usherin a new era of scientific study called psychoneuroimmunology—the effect ofthoughts and emotions on the immune system—an important segment of the mind-bodyconnection.Another notable nocebo study from the ’60s looked at people with asthma.5[endnote.html#fna-5] Researchers gave 40 asthma patients inhalers containingnothing but water vapor, although they told the subjects that the inhalerscontained an allergen or irritant; 19 of them (48 percent) experienced asthmaticsymptoms, such as restriction of their airways, with 12 (30 percent) of thegroup suffering full-blown asthmatic attacks. Researchers then gave the subjectsinhalers said to contain medicine that would relieve their symptoms, and in eachcase, their airways did indeed open back up—although again, the inhalerscontained only water vapor.In both situations—bringing on the asthma symptoms and then dramaticallyreversing them—the patients were responding to suggestion alone, the thoughtplanted in their minds by the researchers, which played out exactly as theyexpected. They were harmed when they thought they’d inhaled something harmful,and they got better when they thought they were receiving medicine—and thesethoughts were greater than their environment, greater than reality. We could saythat their thoughts created a brand-new reality.What does this say about the beliefs we hold and the thoughts we think everyday? Are we more susceptible to catching the flu because all winter long,everywhere we look, we see articles about flu season and signs about flu-shotavailability—all of which reminds us that if we don’t get a flu shot, we’ll getsick? Could it be that when we simply see someone with flu-like symptoms, webecome ill from thinking in the same ways as the children in the poison-ivystudy who got a rash from the inert leaf or from thinking like the asthmaticswho experienced a significant bronchial reaction after inhaling simple watervapor?Are we more likely to suffer from arthritis, stiff joints, poor memory, flaggingenergy, and decreased sex drive as we age, simply because that’s the version ofthe truth that ads, commercials, television shows, and media reports bombard uswith? What other self-fulfilling prophecies are we creating in our minds withoutbeing aware of what we’re doing? And what “inevitable truths” can wesuccessfully reverse simply through thinking new thoughts and choosing newbeliefs?The First Big BreakthroughsA groundbreaking study in the late ’70s showed for the first time that a placebocould trigger the release of endorphins (the body’s natural painkillers), justas certain active drugs do. In the study, Jon Levine, M.D., Ph.D., of theUniversity of California, San Francisco, gave placebos, instead of painmedication, to 40 dental patients who had just had their wisdom teeth removed.6[endnote.html#fna-6] Not surprisingly, because the patients thought they weregetting medicine that would indeed relieve their pain, most reported relief. Butthen the researchers gave the patients an antidote to morphine called naloxone,which chemically blocks the receptor sites for both morphine and endorphins(endogenous morphine) in the brain. When the researchers administered it, thepatients’ pain returned! This proved that by taking the placebos, the patientshad been creating their own endorphins—their own natural pain relievers. It wasa milestone in placebo research, because it meant that the relief the studysubjects experienced wasn’t all in their minds; it was in their minds and theirbodies—in their state of being.If the human body can act like its own pharmacy, producing its own pain drugs,then might it not also be true that it’s fully capable of dispensing othernatural drugs when they’re needed from the infinite blend of chemicals andhealing compounds it houses—drugs that act just like the ones doctors prescribeor maybe even better than the drugs doctors prescribe?Another study in the ’70s, this one by psychologist Robert Ader, Ph.D., at theUniversity of Rochester, added a fascinating new dimension to the placebodiscussion: the element of conditioning. Conditioning, an idea made famous byRussian physiologist Ivan Pavlov, depends on associating one thing withanother—like Pavlov’s dogs associating the sound of the bell with food afterPavlov started ringing it every day before he fed them. In time, the dogs wereconditioned to automatically salivate in anticipation of a meal whenever theyheard a bell. As a result of this type of conditioning, their bodies becametrained to physiologically respond to a new stimulus in the environment (in thiscase, the bell), even without the original stimulus that elicited the response(the food) being present.Therefore, in a conditioned response, we could say that a subconscious program,which is housed in the body (I’ll talk more about this in the coming chapters),seemingly overrides the conscious mind and takes charge. In this way, the bodyis actually conditioned to become the mind because conscious thought is nolonger totally in control.In the case of Pavlov, the dogs were repeatedly exposed to the smell, sight, andtaste of the food, and then Pavlov rang a bell. Over time, just the sound of thebell caused the dogs to automatically change their physiological and chemicalstate without thinking about it consciously. Their autonomic nervous system—thebody’s subconscious system that operates below conscious awareness—took over. Soconditioning creates subconscious internal changes in the body by associatingpast memories with the expectation of internal effects (what we call associativememory) until those expected or anticipated end results automatically occur. Thestronger the conditioning, the less conscious control we have over theseprocesses and the more automatic the subconscious programming becomes.Ader started out attempting to study how long such conditioned responses couldbe expected to last. He fed lab rats saccharine-sweetened water that he’d spikedwith a drug called cyclophosphamide, which causes stomach pain. Afterconditioning the rats to associate the sweet taste of the water with the ache intheir gut, he expected they’d soon refuse to drink the spiked water. Hisintention was to see how long they’d continue to refuse the water so that hecould measure the amount of time their conditioned response to the sweet waterwould last.But what Ader didn’t know initially was that the cyclophosphamide alsosuppresses the immune system, so he was surprised when his rats startedunexpectedly dying from bacterial and viral infections. Changing gears in hisresearch, he continued to give the rats saccharine water (force-feeding themwith an eyedropper) but without the cyclophosphamide. Although they were nolonger receiving the immune-suppressing drug, the rats continued to die ofinfections (while the control group that had received only the sweetened waterall along continued to be fine). Teaming up with University of Rochesterimmunologist Nicholas Cohen, Ph.D., Ader further discovered that when the ratshad been conditioned to associate the taste of the sweetened water with theeffect of the immune-suppressing drug, the association was so strong that justdrinking the sweetened water alone produced the same physiological effect as thedrug—signaling the nervous system to suppress the immune system.7[endnote.html#fna-7]Like Sam Londe, whose story was in Chapter 1 [ch1.html], Ader’s rats died bythought alone. Researchers were beginning to see that the mind was clearly ableto subconsciously activate the body in several powerful ways they’d neverimagined.West Meets EastBy this time, the Eastern practice of Transcendental Meditation (TM), taught byIndian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, had caught on in the United States, fueled bythe enthusiastic participation of several celebrities (starting with the Beatlesin the 1960s). The goal of this technique, which involves quieting the mind andrepeating a mantra during a 20-minute meditation session performed twice a day,is spiritual enlightenment. But the practice caught the attention of Harvardcardiologist Herbert Benson, who became interested in how it might help reducestress and lessen the risk factors for heart disease. Demystifying the process,Benson developed a similar technique, which he called the “relaxation response,”described in his 1975 book by the same title.8 [endnote.html#fna-8] Benson foundthat just by changing their thought patterns, people could switch off the stressresponse, thereby lowering blood pressure, normalizing heart rate, and attainingdeep states of relaxation.While meditation involves maintaining a neutral attitude, attention was alsobeing paid to the beneficial effects of cultivating a more positive attitude andpumping up positive emotions. The way had been paved in 1952, when formerminister Norman Vincent Peale published the book The Power of Positive Thinking,which popularized the idea that our thoughts can have a real effect, bothpositive and negative, on our lives.9 [endnote.html#fna-9] That idea grabbed theattention of the medical community in 1976, when political analyst and magazineeditor Norman Cousins published an account in the New England Journal ofMedicine of how he had used laughter to reverse a potentially fatal disease.10[endnote.html#fna-10] Cousins also told his story in his best-selling bookAnatomy of an Illness, published a few years later.11 [endnote.html#fna-11]Cousins’s doctor had diagnosed him with a degenerative disorder calledankylosing spondylitis—a form of arthritis that causes the breakdown ofcollagen, the fibrous proteins that hold our bodies’ cells together—and hadgiven him only a 1-in-500 chance of recovery. Cousins suffered from tremendouspain and had such difficulty moving his limbs that he could barely turn over inbed. Grainy nodules appeared under his skin, and at his lowest point, his jawnearly locked shut.Convinced that a persistent negative emotional state had contributed to hisillness, he decided it was equally possible that a more positive emotional statecould reverse the damage. While continuing to consult with his doctor, Cousinsstarted a regimen of massive doses of vitamin C and Marx Brothers movies (aswell as other humorous films and comedy shows). He found that ten minutes ofhearty laughter gave him two hours of pain-free sleep. Eventually, he made acomplete recovery. Cousins, quite simply, laughed himself to health.How? Although scientists at the time didn’t have a way to understand or explainsuch a miraculous recovery, research now tells us it’s likely that epigeneticprocesses were at work. Cousins’s shift of attitude changed his body chemistry,which altered his internal state, enabling him to program new genes in new ways;he simply downregulated (or turned off) the genes that were causing his illnessand upregulated (or turned on) the genes responsible for his recovery. (I’ll gointo more detail about turning genes on and off in the coming chapters.)Many years later, research by Keiko Hayashi, Ph.D., of the University of Tsukubain Japan showed the same thing.12 [endnote.html#fna-12] In Hayashi’s study,diabetic patients watching an hour-long comedy program upregulated a total of 39genes, 14 of which were related to natural killer cell activity. While none ofthese genes were directly involved in blood-glucose regulation, the patients’blood-glucose levels were better controlled than after they listened to adiabetes health lecture on a different day. Researchers surmised that laughterinfluences many genes involved with immune response, which in turn contributedto the improved glucose control. The elevated emotion, triggered by thepatients’ brains, turned on the genetic variations, which activated the naturalkiller cells and also somehow improved their glucose response—probably inaddition to many other beneficial effects.As Cousins said of placebos back in 1979, “The process works not because of anymagic in the tablet, but because the human body is its own best apothecary andbecause the most successful prescriptions are filled by the body itself.”13[endnote.html#fna-13]Inspired by Cousins’s experience, and with alternative and mind-body medicinenow in full swing, Yale University surgeon Bernie Siegel started to look at whysome of his cancer patients with poor odds survived while others with betterodds died. Siegel’s work defined cancer survivors largely as those who had afeisty, fighting spirit, and he concluded that there were no incurable diseases,only incurable patients. Siegel also began writing about hope as a powerfulforce for healing and about unconditional love, with the natural pharmacy ofelixirs it provides, as the most powerful stimulant of the immune system.14[endnote.html#fna-14]Placebos Outperform AntidepressantsThe profusion of new antidepressants that appeared around the late 1980s andinto the ’90s would next ignite a controversy that would ultimately (althoughnot immediately) increase respect for the power of placebos. In researching a1998 meta-analysis of published studies on antidepressant drugs, psychologistIrving Kirsch, Ph.D., then at the University of Connecticut, was shocked to findthat in 19 randomized, double-blind clinical trials involving more than 2,300patients, most of the improvement was due not to the antidepressant medications,but to the placebo.15 [endnote.html#fna-15]Kirsch then used the Freedom of Information Act to gain access to the data fromthe drug manufacturers’ unpublished clinical trials, which by law had to bereported to the Food and Drug Administration. Kirsch and his colleagues did asecond meta-analysis, this time on the 35 clinical trials conducted for four ofthe six most widely prescribed antidepressants approved between 1987 and 1999.16[endnote.html#fna-16] Now looking at data from more than 5,000 patients, theresearchers found again that placebos worked just as well as the popularantidepressant drugs Prozac, Effexor, Serzone, and Paxil a whopping 81 percentof the time. In most of the remaining cases where the drug did perform better,the benefit was so small that it wasn’t statistically significant. Only withseverely depressed patients were the prescription drugs clearly better thanplacebo.Not surprisingly, Kirsch’s study caused quite an uproar, although manyresearchers seemed quite willing to throw the placebo baby out with thebathwater. While most of the fracas focused on the fact that these drugs weren’tany better than the placebo, the patients in the trials did, in fact, get betteron antidepressants. The drugs did work. But the patients taking placebos gotbetter, too. Instead of seeing Kirsch’s work as proof that antidepressantsfailed, some researchers chose to see the glass as half-full and pointed to thedata as proof that placebos succeeded.After all, the trials provided stunning proof that thinking that you can getbetter from depression can actually heal depression just as well as taking adrug. The people in the study who got better on placebos were actually makingtheir own natural antidepressants, just as Levine’s patients in the ’70s who hadtheir wisdom teeth out made their own natural painkillers. What Kirsch hadbrought to light was more evidence that our bodies do have an innateintelligence that enables them to serve us with a chemical array of naturalhealing compounds. Interestingly enough, the percentage of people who improvewhile taking placebos in depression trials has gotten greater over time, as hasthe response to active medication; some researchers have suggested that this isbecause the public has greater expectations for the antidepressant drugs, whichin turn makes the placebos more effective in these blind trials.17[endnote.html#fna-17]The Neurobiology of the PlaceboIt was only a matter of time before neuroscientists would start usingsophisticated brain scans to take an intricate look at what happensneurochemically when a placebo is administered. An example is the 2001 study onParkinson’s patients who regained motor skills after receiving only an injectionof saline that they thought was medication (described in Chapter 1[ch1.html]).18 [endnote.html#fna-18] Italian researcher Fabrizio Benedetti,M.D., Ph.D., a pioneer in placebo research, did a similar Parkinson’s study afew years later and, for the first time, was able to show a placebo’s effect onindividual neurons.19 [endnote.html#fna-19]His studies explored not only the neurobiology of expectation, as with theParkinson’s patients, but also the neurobiology at work with classicalconditioning—what Ader had been able to glimpse years previously with hisnauseated lab rats. In one experiment, Benedetti gave study subjects the drugsumatriptan to stimulate growth hormone and inhibit cortisol secretion, and thenwithout the patients’ knowledge, he replaced the drug with a placebo. He foundthat the patients’ brain scans continued to light up in the same places as whenthey were getting the sumatriptan; this was proof that the brain was indeedproducing the same substance—in this case, growth hormone—on its own.20[endnote.html#fna-20]The same was seen to be true for other drug-placebo combinations as well; thechemicals made in the brain closely tracked those that the subjects initiallyreceived via drugs that were given to treat immune system disorders, motordisorders, and depression.21 [endnote.html#fna-21] In fact, Benedetti evenshowed that placebos caused the same side effects as the drugs. For example, inone placebo study using narcotics, the subjects suffered the same side effectsof slow and shallow breathing when taking the placebo, because the placeboeffect so closely mimicked the physiological effects of the drug.22[endnote.html#fna-22]If the truth be told, our bodies are indeed capable of creating a host ofbiological chemicals that can heal, protect us from pain, help us sleep deeply,enhance our immune systems, make us feel pleasure, and even encourage us to fallin love. Reason this for a moment: If a particular gene was already expressed sothat we made those specific chemicals at one point in our lives, but then westopped making them because of some type of stress or illness that turned offthat gene, maybe it’s possible for us to turn the gene back on again, becauseour bodies already know how to do that from previous experience. (Stay tuned forresearch to prove this.)So let’s begin to look at how this happens. The neurological research showssomething truly remarkable: If a person keeps taking the same substance, his orher brain keeps firing the same circuits in the same way—in effect, memorizingwhat the substance does. The person can easily become conditioned to the effectof a particular pill or injection from associating it with a familiar internalchange from past experience. Because of this kind of conditioning, when theperson then takes a placebo, the same hardwired circuits will fire as when he orshe took the drug. An associative memory elicits a subconscious program thatmakes a connection between the pill or injection and the hormonal change in thebody, and then the program automatically signals the body to make the relatedchemicals found in the drug. . . . Isn’t that amazing?Benedetti’s research also makes another point very clear: Different types ofplacebo treatments work best with different goals. For example, in thesumatriptan study, initial verbal suggestions that the placebo would work had noeffect on the production of growth hormone. To use placebos to effectunconscious physiological responses by associative memory (such as to secretehormones or alter the functioning of the immune system), conditioning getsresults, whereas to use placebos to change more conscious responses (such as torelieve pain or lessen depression), a simple suggestion or an expectation works.So there isn’t just one placebo response, Benedetti insisted, but several.Taking Mind Over Matter into Your Own HandsAn astonishing new twist to placebo research came in a 2010 pilot study led byHarvard’s Ted Kaptchuk, D.O.M., that showed that placebos worked even whenpeople knew they were taking a placebo.23 [endnote.html#fna-23] In the study,Kaptchuk and his colleagues gave 40 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)a placebo. Each patient received a bottle clearly labeled “placebo pills” andwas told it contained “placebo pills made of an inert substance, like sugarpills, that have been shown in clinical studies to produce significantimprovement in IBS symptoms through mind-body, self-healing processes.” A secondgroup of 40 IBS patients, given no pills, served as a control group.After three weeks, the group taking the placebos reported twice as much symptomrelief as the no-treatment group—a difference that Kaptchuk noted is comparableto the performance of the best real IBS drugs. These patients hadn’t beentricked into healing themselves. They knew full well that they weren’t gettingany medication—and yet after hearing the suggestion that the placebos couldrelieve their symptoms and believing in an outcome independent of the cause,their bodies were influenced to make it happen.Meanwhile, a parallel track of studies that examines the effect of attitude,perceptions, and beliefs is leading the way in current mind-body research,showing that even something as seemingly concrete as the physical benefit ofexercise can be affected by belief. A 2007 study at Harvard by psychologistsAlia Crum, Ph.D., and Ellen Langer, Ph.D., involving 84 hotel maids is a perfectexample.24 [endnote.html#fna-24]At the start of the study, none of the maids knew that the routine work theyperformed in their jobs exceeded the Surgeon General’s recommendation for ahealthy amount of daily exercise (30 minutes). In fact, 67 percent of the womentold the researchers that they didn’t exercise regularly, and 37 percent saidthey didn’t get any exercise. After this initial assessment, Crum and Langerdivided the maids into two groups. They explained to the first group how theiractivity related to the number of calories they burned and told the maids thatjust by doing their jobs, they got more than enough exercise. They didn’t giveany such information to the second group (who worked in different hotels fromthe first group and so wouldn’t benefit from conversations with the othermaids).One month later, the researchers found that the first group lost an average oftwo pounds, lowered their percentage of body fat, and lowered their systolicblood pressure by an average of 10 points—even though they hadn’t performed anyadditional exercise outside of work or changed their eating habits in any way.The other group, doing the same job as the first, remained virtually unchanged.This echoed similar research done earlier in Quebec, where a group of 48 youngadults participated in a ten-week aerobic exercise program, attending three90-minute exercise sessions per week.25 [endnote.html#fna-25] The group wasdivided into two. The instructors told the first half, the test subjects, thatthe study was specifically designed to improve both their aerobic capacity andtheir psychological well-being. They mentioned only the physical benefits ofaerobics to the second half, who served as the control group. At the end of theten weeks, the researchers found that both groups increased their aerobiccapacity, but it was only the test subjects, not the controls, who also receiveda significant boost in self-esteem (a measure of well-being).As these studies show, our awareness alone can have an important physical effecton our bodies and our health. What we learn, the language that’s used to definewhat we’ll experience, and how we assign meaning to the explanations that areoffered all affect our intention—and when we put greater intention behind whatwe’re doing, we naturally get better results.In short, the more you learn about the “what” and the “why,” the easier and moreeffective the “how” becomes. (My hope is that this book will do the same foryou; the more you know what you’re doing and why you’re doing it, the betterresults you’re bound to get.)We also assign meaning to subtler factors, such as the color of the medicine wetake and the quantity of pills we ingest, as shown in an older but classic studyfrom the University of Cincinnati. In this study, researchers gave 57 medicalstudents either one or two pink or blue capsules—all of them inert, although thestudents were told that the pink capsules were stimulants and the blue ones weresedatives.26 [endnote.html#fna-26] The researchers reported, “Two capsulesproduced more noticeable changes than one, and blue capsules were associatedwith more sedative effects than pink capsules.” Indeed, the students rated theblue pills as being two and a half times more effective as sedatives than thepink pills—even though all the pills were placebos.More recent research shows that beliefs and perceptions can also affect scoresin mental performance on standardized tests. In a 2006 study from Canada, 220female students read fake research reports claiming that men had a 5 percentadvantage over women in math performance.27 [endnote.html#fna-27] The group wasdivided into two, with one group reading that the advantage was due to recentlydiscovered genetic factors, while the other group read that the advantageresulted from the way teachers stereotype girls and boys in elementary school.Then the subjects were given a math test. The women who’d read that men had agenetic advantage scored lower than those who’d read that men had an advantagedue to stereotyping. In other words, when they were primed to think that theirdisadvantage was inevitable, the women performed as if they truly had adisadvantage.A similar effect has been documented with African-American students, who havehistorically scored lower than whites on vocabulary, reading, and math tests,including the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), even when socioeconomic class isnot a factor. In fact, the average black student scores below 70 to 80 percentof the white students of the same age on most standardized tests.28[endnote.html#fna-28] Stanford University social psychologist Claude Steele,Ph.D., explains that an effect called “stereotype threat” is to blame. Hisresearch shows that students who belong to groups that have been negativelystereotyped perform less well when they think their scores will be evaluated inlight of that stereotype than they do when they feel no such pressure.29[endnote.html#fna-29]In Steele’s landmark study, conducted with Joshua Aronson, Ph.D., researchersgave a series of verbal reasoning tests to Stanford sophomores. Some of thestudents were given instructions that primed the stereotype that blacks scorelower than whites by saying that the quiz they were about to take was designedto measure their cognitive ability, while the others were told that the test wasmerely an unimportant research tool. In the group where the stereotype wasprimed, blacks scored lower than whites who had similar SAT scores. When thestereotype was not primed, performance of blacks and whites whose SAT scoreswere similar was the same—proving that the priming made a critical difference.Priming is, basically, when someone, someplace, or something in our environment(for example, taking a test) triggers all sorts of associations that arehardwired into our brains (that people grading this test think black studentsscore lower than whites), causing us to act in certain ways (not scoring ashighly) without being conscious of what we’re doing. It’s called “priming,”because it works just as priming a pump does. You have to have water already inthe pumping system in order to pump more water out of it. So in this example,the idea or belief that others expect black students to score lower than whitesis like the water that’s already in the system—it’s just there all the time.When you do something to stimulate the system (grabbing the pump handle ortaking the test), you’re stirring up all those related thoughts, behaviors, oremotions, and you produce exactly what was waiting to emerge from the system allalong—be that water, in the case of a pump, or lower test scores, if it’s atest.Think about this for a moment. Most automatic behaviors that priming elicits areproduced by unconscious or subconscious programming, which, for the most part,is happening behind the scenes of our awareness. Are we, then, primed to behaveunconsciously all day long—without our even knowing it?Steele replicated this effect with other stereotyped groups as well. When Steelegave a math test to a group of white and Asian men who were strong in math, thewhite men in the group who were told that Asians do slightly better than whiteson the test indeed didn’t do as well as the white men in the control group whoweren’t told that. Steele’s experiments with strong female math students showedsimilar results. Again, when the students’ unconscious expectation was that theywould score lower, they, in fact, did.The greater meaning behind Steele’s research, then, is quite profound: Whatwe’re conditioned to believe about ourselves, and what we’re programmed to thinkother people think about us, affects our performance, including how successfulwe are. It’s the same with placebos: What we’re conditioned to believe willhappen when we take a pill, and what we think that everyone around us (includingour doctors) expects will happen when we do, affects how our bodies respond tothe pill. Could it be that many drugs or even surgeries actually work betterbecause we’re repeatedly primed, educated, and conditioned to believe in theireffects—when if it weren’t for the placebo effect, those drugs might not work aswell or at all?Can You Be Your Own Placebo?Two recent studies from the University of Toledo perhaps shed the best light onhow the mind alone can determine what someone perceives and experiences.30[endnote.html#fna-30] For each study, researchers divided a group of healthyvolunteers into two categories—optimists and pessimists—according to how thevolunteers answered questions on a diagnostic questionnaire. In the first study,they gave the subjects a placebo but told them it was a drug that would makethem feel unwell. The pessimists had a stronger negative reaction to the pillthan the optimists. In the second study, the researchers gave the subjects aplacebo as well, but told them it would help them sleep better. The optimistsreported much better sleep than the pessimists.So the optimists were more likely to respond positively to a suggestion thatsomething would make them feel better, because they were primed to hope for thebest future scenario. And the pessimists were more likely to respond negativelyto a suggestion that something would make them feel worse, because theyconsciously or unconsciously expected the worst potential outcome. It’s as ifthe optimists were unconsciously making the specific chemicals to help themsleep, while the pessimists were unconsciously making a pharmacy of substancesthat made them feel unwell.In other words, in exactly the same environment, those with a positive mind-settend to create positive situations, while those with a negative mind-set tend tocreate negative situations. This is the miracle of our own free-willed,individual, biological engineering.While we may not know exactly how many medical healings are due to the placeboeffect (Beecher’s 1955 paper, mentioned earlier in this chapter, claimed thenumber was 35 percent, but modern-day research shows it can range anywhere from10 to 100 percent31 [endnote.html#fna-31]), the overall number is certainlyextremely significant. Given that, we have to ask ourselves, What percentage ofdiseases and illnesses are due to the effects of negative thoughts in thenocebo? Considering that the latest scientific research in psychology estimatesthat about 70 percent of our thoughts are negative and redundant, the number ofunconsciously created nocebo-like illnesses might be impressive indeed—certainlymuch higher than we realize.32 [endnote.html#fna-32] This idea makes a lot ofsense, given that so many mental, physical, and emotional health conditions seemto arise from nowhere.image [images/line1.jpg]Although it may seem incredible that your mind could actually be that powerful,the research of the past several decades clearly points to a few empoweringtruths: What you think is what you experience, and when it comes to your health,that’s made possible by the amazing pharmacopeia that you have within your bodythat automatically and exquisitely aligns with your thoughts. This miraculousdispensary activates naturally occurring healing molecules that already existwithin your body—delivering different compounds designed to elicit differenteffects in any number of different circumstances. Of course, this raises thequestion: How do we do it?The chapters that follow will explain how this all unfolds on a biological leveland thus how you can apply this innate ability to consciously and intentionallycreate the health—and the life—that you want to experience.image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Three [toc.html#a7]The Placebo Effect in the Brain [toc.html#a7]If you’ve read my previous book, Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself, you’llfind that this chapter reviews much of that material. If you feel that youalready have a good command of that information, you may choose to either skipthis chapter completely or skim it to brush up on those concepts as needed. Ifin doubt, I recommend that you read this chapter, because a thoroughunderstanding of what is presented here will be necessary to fully understandthe chapters that follow.As the stories in the last two chapters illustrate, when we truly change ourstate of being, our bodies can respond to a new mind. And changing our state ofbeing begins with changing our thoughts. Because of the size of our enormousforebrain, the privilege of being a human being is that we can make thought morereal than anything else—and that’s how the placebo works. To see how the processunfolds, it’s vital to examine and review three key elements: conditioning,expectation, and meaning. As you’ll see, these three concepts all seem to worktogether in orchestrating the placebo response.I explained conditioning, the first element, in the discussion about Pavlov inthe previous chapter. To recap, conditioning happens when we associate a pastmemory (for example, taking an aspirin) with a physiological change (getting ridof a headache) because we’ve experienced it so many times. Think about it likethis: If you notice that you have a headache, essentially you become aware of aphysiological change in your inner environment (you’re feeling pain). The nextthing you automatically do is look for something in your outer world (in thiscase, an aspirin) to create a change in your inner world. We could say it wasyour internal state (being in pain) that prompted you to think about some pastchoice you made, action you took, or experience you had in your external realitythat changed how you were feeling (taking an aspirin and getting relief).Thus, the stimulus, or cue, from the outer environment, called the aspirin,creates a specific experience. When that experience produces a physiologicalresponse or reward, it changes your internal environment. The moment you noticea change in your inner environment, you pay attention to what it was in yourouter environment that caused the change. That event—where something outside ofyou changes something inside of you—is called an associative memory.If we keep repeating the process over and over again, by association the outerstimulus can become so strong or reinforced that we can replace the aspirin fora sugar pill that looks like an aspirin, and it will produce an automatic innerresponse (lessening the pain of the headache). That’s one way the placebo works.Figure 3.1A, Figure 3.1B, and Figure 3.1C illustrate the conditioning process.Expectation, the second element, comes into play when we have reason toanticipate a different outcome. So, for example, if we have chronic pain fromarthritis and get a new medication from the doctor, who enthusiasticallyexplains to us that it’s supposed to alleviate our pain, we accept hissuggestion and expect that when we take this new medication, something differentwill happen (we won’t be in pain anymore). Then, in effect, our doctor hasinfluenced our level of suggestibility.Once we become more suggestible, we’re naturally associating something outsideof ourselves (the new medication) with the selection of a different possibility(being pain-free). In our minds, we are picking a different future potential andhoping, anticipating, and expecting that we’ll get that different result. If weemotionally accept and then embrace that new outcome we’ve selected, and theintensity of our emotion is great enough, our brains and our bodies won’t knowthe difference between imagining that we’ve changed our state of being to beingpain-free and the actual event that caused the change to a new state of being.To the brain and the body, they are the same.image [images/49.jpg]In Figure 3.1A, a stimulus produces a physiological change called a response ora reward. Figure 3.1B demonstrates that if you pair a stimulus with aconditioned stimulus enough times, it will still produce a response. Figure 3.1Cshows if you remove the stimulus and substitute a conditioned stimulus—like aplacebo—it can produce the same physiological response.Consequently, the brain fires the same neural circuits as it would if our statehad changed (if the drug worked to relieve the pain) while it releases similarchemicals into the body. What we’re expecting (to be pain-free) then actuallyhappens, because the brain and the body create the perfect pharmacy to alter ourinternal condition. We are now in a new state of being—that is, the mind andbody are working as one. We’re that powerful.Assigning meaning, the third element, to a placebo helps it work, because whenwe give an action a new meaning, then we have added intention behind it. Inother words, when we learn and understand something new, we put more of ourconscious, purposeful energy into it. So, for example, in the study about thehotel maids from the previous chapter, once the maids understood how muchphysical exercise they were doing every day just by performing their jobs, aswell as the benefits of that exercise, they assigned more meaning to thoseactions. They weren’t just vacuuming, scrubbing, and mopping; they realized theywere working their muscles, increasing their strength, and burning calories.Because the vacuuming, scrubbing, and mopping had more meaning after theresearchers educated them about the physical advantages of exercise, the maids’intention or aim as they worked wasn’t just to complete their tasks—it was alsoto get physical exercise and become healthier.And that’s exactly what happened. The members of the control group didn’t assignthe same meaning to their tasks, because they didn’t know that what they weredoing was beneficial to their health, so they also didn’t receive the samebenefits—even though they were performing exactly the same actions.The placebo works the same way. The more you believe that a particularsubstance, procedure, or surgery will work because you’ve been educated aboutits benefits, the better your chances of responding to the thought of improvingyour health and getting better. In other words, if you place more meaning behinda possible experience with a person, place, or thing in your externalenvironment in order to change your internal environment, then you’re morelikely to be successful at intentionally changing your inner state by thoughtalone. In addition, the more you can accept a new outcome related to yourhealth—because you’ve been educated about the possible rewards of what you’redoing—the clearer the model you’re creating in your own mind, and so the betteryou’ll be at priming your brain and your body to replicate exactly that. Simplysaid, the more you believe in the cause, the better the effect.The Placebo: Anatomy of a ThoughtIf the placebo effect is a function of how a thought can change physiology—wecould call it mind over matter—then perhaps we should examine our thoughts andhow they interact with our brains and our bodies. Let’s begin with our ownpersonal daily thoughts.We are creatures of habit. We think somewhere between 60,000 to 70,000 thoughtsin one day,1 [endnote.html#fnb-1] and 90 percent of those thoughts are exactlythe same ones we had the day before. We get up on the same side of the bed, gothrough the same routine in the bathroom, comb our hair in the same way, sit inthe same chair as we eat the same breakfast and hold our mug in the same hand,drive the same route to the same job, and do the same things we know how to doso well with the same people (who push the same emotional buttons) every day.And then we hurry up and go home so that we can hurry up and check our e-mail sothat we can hurry up and eat dinner so that we can hurry up and watch ourfavorite TV shows so that we can hurry up and brush our teeth in the samebedtime routine so that we can hurry up and go to bed at the same time so thatwe can hurry up and do it all over again the next day.If it sounds as though I’m saying that we live a huge part of our lives onautopilot, that’s exactly right. Thinking the same thoughts leads us to make thesame choices. Making the same choices leads to demonstrating the same behaviors.Demonstrating the same behaviors leads us to create the same experiences.Creating the same experiences leads us to produce the same emotions. And thosesame emotions then drive the same thoughts. Take a look at Figure 3.2 and followthe sequence of how our same thoughts create the same reality as usual.image [images/52.jpg]How we create the same reality by thought alone.As a result of this conscious or unconscious process, your biology stays thesame. Neither your brain nor your body changes at all, because you’re thinkingthe same thoughts, performing the same actions, and living by the sameemotions—even though you may be secretly hoping your life will change. Youcreate the same brain activity, which activates the same brain circuits andreproduces the same brain chemistry, which affects your body chemistry in thesame way. And that same chemistry signals the same genes in the same ways. Andthe same gene expression creates the same proteins, the building blocks ofcells, which keep the body the same (I’ll go into more on proteins later). Andsince the expression of proteins is the expression of life or health, your lifeand your health stay the same.Now take a look at your life for a moment. What does this mean for you? Ifyou’re thinking the same thoughts as yesterday, more than likely, you’re makingthe same choices today. Those same choices today are leading to the samebehaviors tomorrow. The same habitual behaviors tomorrow are producing the sameexperiences in your future. The same events in your future reality are creatingthe same predictable emotions for you all the time. And as a result, you’refeeling the same every day. Your yesterday becomes your tomorrow—so in truth,your past is your future.If you agree with me up to this point, then we could say that the familiarfeeling I just described is “you”—your identity or your personality. It’s yourstate of being. And it’s comfortable, effortless, and automatic. It’s the knownyou who, quite frankly, is living in the past. When you keep this redundantprocess going on a daily basis (because you wake up in the morning andanticipate and remember the feeling of “you” every day), in time that knownstate of being can drive only the same thoughts that will influence you to cravethe same automatic cycle of choices, behaviors, and experiences in order toarrive back at that familiar feeling that you think of as “you.” So everythingstays the same about your personality.If this is your personality, then your personality creates your personalreality. It’s that simple. And your personality is made up of how you think, howyou act, and how you feel. So the present personality who is reading this pagehas created the present personal reality called your life; and that also meansthat if you want to create a new personal reality—a new life—then you have tobegin to examine or think about the thoughts you’ve been thinking and changethem. You must become conscious of the unconscious behaviors you’ve beenchoosing to demonstrate that have led to the same experiences, and then you mustmake new choices, take new actions, and create new experiences. Figure 3.3 showshow your personality influences your personal reality.image [images/54.jpg]Your personality is made up of how you think, act, and feel. It is your state ofbeing. Therefore, your same thoughts, actions, and feelings will keep youenslaved to the same past personal reality. However, when you as a personalityembrace new thoughts, actions, and feelings, you will inevitably create a newpersonal reality in your future.You must observe and pay attention to those emotions that you’ve memorized andthat you live by on a daily basis, and decide if living by those emotions overand over again is loving to you. You see, most people try to create a newpersonal reality as the same old personality, and it doesn’t work. In order tochange your life, you have to literally become someone else. Stay tuned for somesound science to support this process. Take a glance at Figure 3.4 and followthe sequence again.image [images/55.jpg]How we create a new reality by thought alone.So if you understand this model, then you should agree with me that your newthoughts should lead to new choices. New choices should lead to new behaviors.New behaviors should lead to new experiences. New experiences should create newemotions, and new emotions and feelings should inspire you to think in new ways.That’s called “evolution.” And your personal reality and your biology—your braincircuitry, your internal chemistry, your genetic expression, and ultimately yourhealth—should change as a result of this new personality, this new state ofbeing. And it all seems to start with a thought.A Quick Look at How the Brain WorksUp to this point, I’ve briefly mentioned terms like brain circuitry, neuralnetworks, brain chemistry, and genetic expression without giving you muchexplanation of what they mean. So for the rest of the chapter, I want to outlinesome simple scientific understandings of how the brain and body work together inorder to build a complete model of how you really can become your own placebo.Your brain, which is at least 75 percent water and is the consistency of asoft-boiled egg, is made up of some 100 billion nerve cells, called neurons,that are seamlessly arranged and suspended in this aqueous environment. Eachnerve cell resembles a leafless but elastic oak tree, with wiggly branches androot systems that connect and disconnect to other nerve cells. The number ofconnections a particular nerve cell might make can range from 1,000 to more than100,000, depending on where in the brain the nerve cell resides. For example,your neocortex—your thinking brain—has about 10,000 to 40,000 connections perneuron.We used to think of the brain as a computer, and while there are certainly somesimilarities, we now know there’s much more to the story. Each neuron is its ownunique biocomputer, with more than 60 megabytes of RAM. It’s capable ofprocessing enormous amounts of data—up to hundreds of thousands of functions persecond. As we learn new things and have new experiences in our lives, ourneurons make new connections, exchanging electrochemical information with eachother. Those connections are called synaptic connections, because the placewhere the cells exchange information—the gap between the branch of one neuronand the root of another—is called a synapse.If learning is making new synaptic connections, then remembering is keepingthose connections wired together. So in effect, a memory is a long-termrelationship or connection between the nerve cells. And the creation of theseconnections, and the ways they change over time, alters the physical structureof the brain.As the brain makes these changes, our thoughts produce a blend of variouschemicals called neurotransmitters (serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine are afew examples you may recognize). When we think thoughts, neurotransmitters atone branch of one neuron tree cross the synaptic gap to reach the root ofanother neuron tree. Once they cross that gap, the neuron fires with anelectrical bolt of information. When we continue thinking the same thoughts, theneuron keeps firing in the same ways, strengthening the relationship between thetwo cells so that they can more readily convey a signal the next time thoseneurons fire. As a result, the brain shows physical evidence that something wasnot only learned, but also remembered. This process of selective strengtheningis called synaptic potentiation.When jungles of neurons fire in unison to support a new thought, an additionalchemical (a protein) is created within the nerve cell and makes its way to thecell’s center, or nucleus, where it lands in the DNA. The protein then switcheson several genes. Since the job of the genes is to make proteins that maintainboth the structure and function of the body, the nerve cell then quickly makes anew protein to create new branches between nerve cells. So when we repeat athought or an experience enough times, our brain cells make not only strongerconnections between each other (which affects our physiological functions), butalso a greater number of total connections (which affects the physical structureof the body). The brain becomes more enriched microscopically.So as soon as you think a new thought, you become changed—neurologically,chemically, and genetically. In fact, you can gain thousands of new connectionsin a matter of seconds from novel learning, new ways of thinking, and freshexperiences. This means that by thought alone, you can personally activate newgenes right away. It happens just by changing your mind; it’s mind over matter.Nobel laureate Eric Kandel, M.D., showed that when new memories are formed, thenumber of synaptic connections in the sensory neurons that are stimulateddoubles, to 2,600. However, unless the original learning experience is repeatedover and over again, the number of new connections falls back to the original1,300 in a matter of only three weeks.Therefore, if we repeat what we learn enough times, we strengthen communities ofneurons to support us in remembering it the next time. If we don’t, then thesynaptic connections soon disappear and the memory is erased. This is why it’simportant for us to continually update, review, and remember our new thoughts,choices, behaviors, habits, beliefs, and experiences if we want them to solidifyin our brains.2 [endnote.html#fnb-2] Figure 3.5 will help you become familiarwith neurons and neural networks.To get an idea of how vast this system really is, imagine a nerve cellconnecting to 40,000 other nerve cells. Let’s say it’s processing 100,000 bitsof information per second and sharing that information with other neurons thatare also processing 100,000 functions per second. This network, formed fromclusters of neurons working together, is called a neural network (or a neuralnet for short). Neural nets form communities of synaptic connections. We canalso call them your neurocircuitry.So as there are physical changes in the nerve cells that make up your brain’sgray matter, and as neurons are selected and instructed to organize themselvesinto these vast networks capable of processing hundreds of millions of bits ofinformation, the physical hardware of the brain also changes, adapting to theinformation it receives from the environment. In time, as thenetworks—converging and diverging propagations of electrical activity like acrazy lightning storm in thick clouds—are repeatedly turned on, the brain willkeep using the same hardware systems (the physical neural networks) but willalso create a software program (an automatic neural network). That’s how theprograms are installed in the brain. The hardware creates the software, and thesoftware system is embedded into the hardware—and every time the software isused, it reinforces the hardware.image [images/59.jpg]This is a simple graphic representation of neurons in a neural network. Theminute space between the branches of individual neurons that facilitatescommunication between them is called the synaptic gap. About 100,000 neurons canfit into the same space as a grain of sand and will have more than a billionconnections among them.So when you’re thinking the same thoughts and having the same feelings all thetime because you’re not learning or doing anything new, your brain is firing itsneurons and activating the neural networks in exactly the same sequences,patterns, and combinations. They become the automatic programs that youunconsciously use every day. You have an automatic neural network to speak alanguage, to shave your face or put on makeup, to type on the computer, to judgeyour co-worker, and so on, because you’ve performed those actions so many timesthat they’ve become practically unconscious. You no longer have to consciouslythink about it. It’s effortless.You’ve reinforced those circuits so often that they’ve become hardwired. Theconnections between neurons become more glued together, additional circuits areformed, and the branches actually expand and become physically thicker—just aswe might strengthen and reinforce a bridge, build a few new roads, or widen afreeway to accommodate more traffic.One of the most basic principles in neuroscience states, “Nerve cells that firetogether wire together.”3 [endnote.html#fnb-3] As your brain fires repeatedly inthe same manner, you’re reproducing the same level of mind. According toneuroscience, mind is the brain in action or at work. Thus, we can say that ifyou’re reminding yourself of who you think you are on a daily basis byreproducing the same mind, you’re making your brain fire in the same ways andyou’ll activate the same neural networks for years on end. By the time you reachyour mid-30s, your brain has organized itself into a very finite signature ofautomatic programs—and that fixed pattern is called your identity.Think of it as a box inside your brain. There’s no literal box inside your head,of course. But it’s safe to say that thinking inside the box means you’vephysically hardwired your brain into a limited pattern, as illustrated in Figure3.6. By reproducing the same level of mind over and over again, the mostcommonly fired, neurologically wired set of circuits has predetermined who youare as a result of your own volition.image [images/61.jpg]If your thoughts, choices, behaviors, experiences, and emotional states remainthe same for years on end—and the same thoughts are always equal to the samefeelings, reinforcing the same endless cycle—then your brain becomes hardwiredinto a finite signature. That’s because you are re-creating the same mind everyday by making your brain fire in the same patterns. Over time, this biologicallyreinforces a specific limited set of neural networks, making your brainphysically more prone to creating the same level of mind—you’re now thinking inthe box. The totality of those hardwired circuits is called your identity.NeuroplasticitySo our goal, then, needs to be thinking outside the box to make the brain firein new ways, as Figure 3.7 illustrates. That’s what having an open mind means,because whenever you make your brain work differently, you’re literally changingyour mind.Research shows that as we use our brains, they grow and change, thanks toneuroplasticity—the brain’s ability to adapt and change when we learn newinformation. For example, the longer mathematicians study math, the more neuralbranches sprout in the area of the brain used for math.4 [endnote.html#fnb-4]And after years of performing in symphonies and orchestras, professionalmusicians expand the part of their brains associated with language and musicalabilities.5 [endnote.html#fnb-5]image [images/62.jpg]When you learn new things and begin to think in new ways, you are making yourbrain fire in different sequences, patterns, and combinations. That is, you areactivating many diverse networks of neurons in different ways. And whenever youmake your brain work differently, you’re changing your mind. As you begin tothink outside the box, new thoughts should lead to new choices, new behaviors,new experiences, and new emotions. Now your identity is also changing.The official scientific terms for how neuroplasticity works are pruning andsprouting, which mean exactly what they sound like: getting rid of some neuralconnections, patterns, and circuits and creating new ones. In a well-functioningbrain, this process can happen in a matter of seconds. Researchers at theUniversity of California at Berkeley demonstrated this in a study on laboratoryrats. They found that rats living in an enriched environment (sharing a cagewith siblings and offspring and having access to many different toys) had largerbrains with more neurons and more connections between those neurons than did therats in less-enriched environments.6 [endnote.html#fnb-6] Again, when we learnnew things and have new experiences, we’re literally changing our brains.To break free from the chains of hardwired programming and the conditioning thatkeeps you the same takes considerable effort. It also requires knowledge,because when you learn vital information about yourself or your life, you stitcha whole new pattern into the three-dimensional embroidery of your own graymatter. Now you have more raw materials to make the brain work in new anddifferent ways. You begin to think about and perceive reality differently,because you begin to see your life through the lens of a new mind.Crossing the River of ChangeAt this point, you can see that in order to change, you have to become consciousof your unconscious self (which you now know is just a set of hardwiredprograms).The hardest part about change is not making the same choices we made the daybefore. The reason it’s so difficult is that the moment we no longer arethinking the same thoughts that lead to the same choices—which cause us toautomatically act in habitual ways so that we can experience the same events inorder to reaffirm the same emotions of our identity—we immediately feeluncomfortable. This new state of being is unfamiliar; it’s unknown. It doesn’tfeel “normal.” We don’t feel like ourselves anymore—because we’re not ourselves.And because everything feels uncertain, we no longer can predict the feeling ofthe familiar self and how it’s mirrored back to us in our lives.As uncomfortable as that may be at first, that’s the moment we know we’vestepped into the river of change. We’ve entered the unknown. The instant that weno longer are being our old selves, we have to cross a gap between the old selfand the new self, which Figure 3.8 clearly shows. In other words, we don’t alljust waltz into a new personality in a matter of moments. It takes time.image [images/64.jpg]Crossing the river of change requires that you leave the same familiarpredictable self—connected to the same thoughts, same choices, same behaviors,and same feelings—and step into a void or the unknown. The gap between the oldself and the new self is the biological death of your old personality. If theold self must die, then you have to create a new self with new thoughts, newchoices, new behaviors, and new emotions. Entering this river is stepping towarda new unpredictable, unfamiliar self. The unknown is the only place where youcan create—you cannot create anything new from the known.Usually when people step into the river of change, that void between the oldself and the new self is so uncomfortable that they immediately slip back intobeing their old selves again. They unconsciously think, This doesn’t feel right,I’m uncomfortable, or I don’t feel so good. The moment they accept that thought,or autosuggestion (and become suggestible to their own thoughts), they willunconsciously make the same old choices again that will lead to the progressionof the same habitual behaviors to create the same experiences that automaticallyendorse the same emotions and feelings. And then they say to themselves, Thisfeels right. But what they really mean is that it feels familiar.Once we understand that crossing the river of change and feeling that discomfortis actually the biological, neurological, chemical, and even genetic death ofthe old self, we have power over change and we can set our sights on the otherside of the river. If we embrace the fact that change is the denaturing of thehardwired circuitry from years of unconsciously thinking the same way, we cancope. If we understand that the discomfort we feel is the dismantling of oldattitudes, beliefs, and perceptions that have been repeatedly etched into ourcerebral architecture, we can endure. If we can reason that the cravings webattle in the midst of change are real withdrawals from the chemical-emotionaladdictions of the body, we can ride it out. If we can comprehend that realbiological variations are occurring from subconscious habits and behaviors inwhich our bodies are changing on a cellular level, we can forge on. And if wecan remember that we are modifying our very genes from this life and from untoldprevious generations, we can stay focused and inspired to an end.Some people call this experience the dark night of the soul. It’s the phoenixigniting itself and burning to ashes. The old self has to die for a new one tobe reborn. Of course that feels uncomfortable!But that’s okay, because that unknown is the perfect place to create from—it’sthe place where possibilities exist. What could be better than that? Most of ushave been conditioned to run from the unknown, so now we have to learn to becomecomfortable in the void or the unknown, instead of fearing it.If you told me that you didn’t like being in that void because it’s sodisorienting and that you can’t see what lies ahead because you can’t predictyour future, I’d say that’s actually great, because the best way to predict thefuture is to create it—not from the known, but from the unknown.As the new self is born, we must be biologically different, too. New neuronalconnections must be sprouted and sealed by the conscious choice to think and actin new ways every day. Those connections must be reinforced by our repeatedlycreating the same experiences until they become a habit. New chemical statesmust become familiar to us from the emotions of enough new experiences. And newgenes must be signaled to make new proteins to alter our state of being in newways. And if, as we’ve seen, the expression of proteins is the expression oflife and the expression of life is equal to the health of the body, then a newlevel of structural and functional health and life will follow. A renewed mindand a renewed body must emerge.Now, when a new day dawns for us after the long night of darkness and thephoenix rises regenerated from its ashes, we have invented a new self. And thephysical, biological expression of the new self is literally becoming someoneelse. That’s true metamorphosis.Overcoming Your EnvironmentAnother way to look at the brain is to say that it’s organized to reflecteverything you know and have experienced in your life. Now you can understandthat each time you’ve interacted with your external world, those events haveshaped and molded who you are today. The complex networks of neurons that havefired and wired together throughout your days on Earth formed trillions andtrillions of connections, because you learned and formed memories. And sinceevery place where one neuron connects with another neuron is called a “memory,”then your brain is a living record of the past. The vast experiences with everyperson and thing at different times and places in your external environment havebeen stamped into the recesses of your gray matter.So by nature, most of us are thinking in the past, because we’re using the samehardware and software programs from our past memories. And if we’re living thesame life every day by doing the same things at the same time, seeing the samepeople at the same place, and creating the same experiences from yesterday, thenwe’re enslaved to having our outer worlds influence our inner worlds. It’s ourenvironment that is controlling how we think, act, and feel. We’re victims ofour personal realities, because our personal realities are creating ourpersonalities—and it’s become an unconscious process. Then that, of course,reaffirms the same thinking and feeling, and now there’s a tango or a matchbetween our outer worlds and our inner worlds, and they merge and become thesame—and so do we.If our environment is regulating how we’re thinking and feeling every day, thenin order to change, something about ourselves or our lives would have to begreater than the present circumstances in our environment.Thinking and Feeling, and Feeling and ThinkingJust as thoughts are the language of the brain, feelings are the language of thebody. And how you think and how you feel create a state of being. A state ofbeing is when your mind and body are working together. So your present state ofbeing is your genuine mind-body connection.Every time you have a thought, in addition to making neurotransmitters, yourbrain also makes another chemical—a small protein called a neuropeptide thatsends a message to your body. Your body then reacts by having a feeling. Thebrain notices that the body is having a feeling, so the brain generates anotherthought matched exactly to that feeling that will produce more of the samechemical messages that allow you to think the way you were just feeling.So thinking creates feeling, and then feeling creates thinking that’s equal tothose feelings. It’s a loop (one that, for most people, can go on for years).And because the brain acts on the body’s feelings by generating the samethoughts that will produce the same emotions, it becomes clear that redundantthoughts hardwire your brain into a fixed pattern of neurocircuitry.But what happens in the body? Because feelings are the modus operandi of thebody, the emotions you continually feel based on your automatic thinking willcondition the body to memorize those emotions that are equal to the unconscioushardwired mind and brain. That means that the conscious mind isn’t really incharge. The body has subconsciously been programmed and conditioned, in a veryreal way, to become its own mind.Eventually, when this loop of thinking and feeling and then feeling and thinkinghas been operating long enough, our bodies memorize the emotions that our brainshave signaled our bodies to feel. The cycle becomes so established and ingrainedthat it creates a familiar state of being—one based on old information thatkeeps recycling. Those emotions, which are nothing more than the chemicalrecords of past experiences, are driving our thoughts and are being played outover and over again. As long as this continues, we’re living in the past. Nowonder it’s so hard for us to change our future!If the neurons are firing the same way, they’re triggering the release of thesame chemical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the brain and body, andthen these same chemicals begin to train the body to further remember thoseemotions by altering it physically once again. The cells and tissues receivethese very specific chemical signals at specific receptor sites. Receptor sitesare akin to docking stations for chemical messengers. The messengers fitperfectly in place, like a child’s puzzle in which certain shapes, like acircle, a triangle, or a square, fit into specific openings.Think of those chemical messengers, which are really molecules of emotion, ascarrying bar codes that enable the cell receptors to read the messengers’electromagnetic energy. When the exact match is made, the receptor site preparesitself. The messenger docks, the cell receives the chemical messages, and thenthe cell creates or alters a protein. The new protein activates the cell’s DNAwithin the nucleus. The DNA opens up and unwinds, the gene is read for thatcorresponding message from outside the cell, and the cell makes a new proteinfrom its DNA (for example, a particular hormone) and releases it into the body.Now the body is being trained by the mind. If this process continues for yearsand years because the same signals outside of the cell are coming from the samelevel of mind in the brain (because the person is thinking, acting, and feelingthe same every day), then it makes sense that the same genes will be activatedin the same ways, because the body is receiving the same data from theenvironment. There are no new thoughts ignited, no new choices made, no newbehaviors demonstrated, no new experiences embraced, and no new feelingscreated. When the same genes are repeatedly activated by the same informationfrom the brain, then the genes keep getting selected over and over again, andjust like gears in a car, they start to wear out. The body makes proteins withweaker structures and lesser functions. We get sick and we age.In time, one of two scenarios can occur. The intelligence of the cell membrane,which is consistently receiving the same information, can adapt to the body’sneeds and demands by modifying its receptor sites so that it can accommodatemore of those chemicals. Basically, it creates more docking stations to satisfythe demand—just as supermarkets open up additional checkout lanes when the linesget too long. If business stays good (if those same chemicals keep coming), thenyou’ll have to hire more employees and keep more lanes open. Now the body isequal to and has become the mind.In the other scenario, the cell becomes too overwhelmed with the continualbombardment of feelings and emotions on a moment-to-moment basis to allow allthe chemical messengers to dock. Because the same chemicals are more or lesshanging around outside the cell’s docking-station doors day in and day out, thecell gets used to those chemicals being there. So only when the brain produces alot more heightened emotions does the cell become willing to open its doors.Once you increase the intensity of the emotion, the cell is stimulated enough sothat the docking-station doors open and the cell turns on. (You’ll hear moreabout the importance of emotion later—this is a key part of the placeboequation.)In the first scenario, when the cell makes new receptor sites, the body willcrave those specific chemicals when the brain doesn’t make enough, andconsequently, our feelings will determine our thinking—our bodies will controlour minds. That’s what I mean when I say the body memorizes the emotion. It hasbecome biologically conditioned and altered to be a reflection of the mind.In the second scenario, once the cell is overwhelmed by the bombardment and thereceptors become desensitized, then just as a drug addict does, the body willrequire a greater chemical thrill to turn on the cell. In other words, in orderfor the body to become stimulated and get its fix, you’ll need to get angrier,more worried, guiltier, or more confused than last time. So you might feel theneed to start a bit of drama by yelling at your dog for no reason, just to givethe body its drug of choice. Or maybe you can’t help talking about how much youdespise your mother-in-law just so the body has even more chemicals availablewith enough strength to arouse the cell. Or you start obsessing about somehorrible imagined outcome just so the body can get a rush of adrenal hormones.When the body isn’t getting its emotional chemical needs met, it will signal thebrain to make more of those chemicals—the body is controlling the mind. Thatsounds very much like an addiction. So now when I use the term emotionaladdiction, you’ll understand what I mean.When feelings have become the means of thinking in this manner—or we can’t thinkgreater than how we feel—then we’re in the program. Our thinking is how we feel,and our feelings are how we think. What we experience is like a merger ofthoughts and feelings—we’re finking or theeling. Since we’re caught in thisloop, then our bodies, as the unconscious mind, actually believe they’re livingin the same past experience 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Ourminds and bodies are one, aligned to a destiny predetermined by our unconsciousprograms. So to change requires being greater than the body and all itsemotional memories, addictions, and unconscious habituations—that is, to nolonger be defined by the body as the mind.The repetition of the cycle of thinking and feeling and then feeling andthinking is the conditioning process of the body that the conscious minddelivers. Once the body becomes the mind, that’s called a “habit”—a habit iswhen your body is the mind. Ninety-five percent of who you are by the timeyou’re 35 years old is a set of memorized behaviors, skills, emotionalreactions, beliefs, perceptions, and attitudes that functions like asubconscious automatic computer program.So 95 percent of who you are is a subconscious or even an unconscious state ofbeing. And that means your conscious mind’s 5 percent is working against the 95percent of what you’ve memorized subconsciously. You can think positively allyou want, but that 5 percent of your mind that’s conscious will feel as if it’sswimming upstream against the current of the other 95 percent of your mind—yourunconscious body chemistry that has been remembering and memorizing whatevernegativity you’ve been harboring for the past 35 years; that’s mind and bodyworking in opposition. No wonder you don’t get very far when you try to fightthat current!That’s why I called my last book Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself, becausethat’s the greatest habit we have to break—thinking, feeling, and behaving inthe same way that reinforces the unconscious programs that reflect ourpersonalities and our personal realities. We can’t create a new future whilewe’re living in our past. It’s simply impossible.What It Takes to Be Your Own PlaceboHere’s an example that will pull all of this together. I’m intentionallychoosing a negative event, because these types of events tend to keep uslimited, whereas more successful, empowering, and uplifting events usually helpus create a better future. (That process will become clear soon.)So let’s say that you had a horrific past experience with public speaking thatscarred you emotionally. (Feel free to substitute any emotionally scarringexperience of your choice here.) Because of that experience, you now fearstanding up to talk in front of a group of people. It makes you feel insecure,anxious, and anything but confident. Just thinking about looking out over ameeting room of even 20 people causes your throat to close up, your hands to gocold and clammy, your heart to race, your face and neck to flush, your stomachto twist, and your brain to freeze.All of these reactions come under the jurisdiction of your autonomic nervoussystem, the nervous system that functions subconsciously—below your consciouscontrol. Think of autonomic as automatic—it’s the part of the nervous systemthat regulates digestion, hormones, circulation, body temperature, and so onwithout your having any conscious control over them. You can’t decide to changeyour heart rate, alter blood flow to your extremities to cool them off, heat upyour face and neck, change the metabolic secretions of your digestive enzymes,or shut off millions of nerve cells from firing on command. Try as you might toconsciously change any one of these functions, you’ll probably find that youwon’t be able to do it.So when your body makes these autonomic physiological changes, it’s because youhave associated the future thought of standing in front of an audiencedelivering a presentation with the past emotional memory of your flawedpublic-speaking experience. And when that future thought, idea, or possibilityis consistently associated with the past feelings of anxiety, failure, orembarrassment, in time the mind will condition the body to respond automaticallyto that feeling. This is how we continuously move into familiar states ofbeing—our thoughts and feelings become one with the past because we can’t thinkgreater than how we feel.Now let’s take a closer look at how that works inside your brain. The particularevent that was embossed and patterned neurologically as a past memory (remember,experience enriches brain circuitry) becomes physically wired in your brain justlike a footprint. As a consequence, you can retrace your steps and recall thenegative public-speaking experience as a thought. In order for you to rememberit on command, the experience must have had a significant enough emotionalcharge as well. So you can also emotionally bring to mind all of the feelingsrelated to your foiled attempt to be a successful orator, because it seems asthough you were chemically altered from the experience.I want to point out that feelings and emotions are the end products of pastexperiences. When you’re caught up in an experience, your senses capture theevent and then relay all of that vital information back to your brain throughfive different sensory pathways. Once all of that new data reaches the brain,mobs of nerve cells organize into fresh networks to reflect the novel externalevent. The moment those circuits jell, the brain makes a chemical to signal thebody and alter its physiology. That chemical is called a feeling or an emotion.Thus, we can remember past events, because we can remind ourselves of how theyfelt.So when your lecture went amiss, all of the information that your five senseswere picking up in your external environment changed how you were feeling inyour inner environment. The information that your senses were processing—thesight of the faces in the audience, the expansiveness of the room, and thebright lights above your head; the echoing sound of the microphone and thedeafening silence after your first attempted joke; the immediate rise in theroom’s temperature the moment you started talking; the smell of your old cologneevaporating from your own perspiration—changed your inner state of being. Andthe moment you correlated this unique event in your outer world of the senses(the cause) with the changes going on in your inner world of thoughts andfeelings (the effect), you created a memory. You associated a cause with aneffect—and your own conditioning process began.So after the self-inflicted torture of that day, which fortunately ended with norotten fruits or vegetables being thrown in your direction, you drove home. Onthe ride, you kept recalling the event over and over again. And to varyingdegrees, every time you reminded yourself (which is exactly that: reproducingthe same level of mind) of your experience, you produced the same chemicalchanges in your brain and body. In a sense, you repeatedly reaffirmed the pastand continued the conditioning process further.Because your body acts as your unconscious mind, it didn’t know the differencebetween the actual event in your life that created the emotional state and theemotions you created by thought alone when you remembered the event. Your bodybelieved that it was living in the same experience over and over again, eventhough you were actually alone in the comfort of your car, and the bodyresponded physiologically as though you were indeed reliving that experience inthe present time. As you fired and wired the circuits in your brain that werederived from the thoughts related to that experience, you were physicallymaintaining the synaptic connections, and you were now creating even morelasting connections within those networks—you were creating a long-term memory.Once you arrived home, you told your partner, your friends, and maybe even yourmother about the events of that day. As you described the trauma in grievousdetail, you were working yourself into an emotional froth. As you also relivedthe emotions of the incident, you chemically conditioned your body to the day’spast event. You physiologically trained your body to become your personalhistory—subconsciously, unconsciously, and automatically.In the days that followed, you were moody. People couldn’t help noticing this,and every time someone asked you, “What’s wrong?” you just couldn’t resist. Youopportunistically took them up on the invitation to become more addicted to therush of chemistry from your past. The mood created from that experience was justone long emotional reaction lasting for days. When weeks of feeling the same wayevery time you remembered the event turned into months, even years, it became aprolonged emotional reaction. It’s now not only a part of your temperament,character, and nature, but also your personality. It’s who you are.If someone else asks you to talk in front of a group again, you automaticallycringe, shrink, and become anxious. Your external environment is controllingyour internal environment, and you’re unable to be greater than it. As youexpect the thought that your future (a public-speaking opening) will be morelike the feeling of your past (unlivable torment), just like magic, your body,as the mind, automatically and subconsciously responds. Try as you might, itseems as if your conscious mind can gain no control over it. In a matter ofseconds, a host of conditioned responses from your brain and body’s own pharmacymanifest—profuse sweating, dry mouth, weak knees, nausea, dizziness, shortnessof breath, and uncontrollable fatigue—all from a single thought that changesyour physiology. Sounds like the placebo to me.If you could, you’d turn down the opportunity to do the talk, saying somethinglike, “I am not a public speaker,” “I am insecure in front of people,” “I am abad presenter,” or “I am too afraid to talk in front of large audiences.”Whenever you say, “I am . . .” (insert your own words here), what you aredeclaring is that your mind and body are aligned to a future or that yourthoughts and feelings are one with your destiny. You’re reinforcing a memorizedstate of being.If, by chance, you were then asked why you chose to be defined by your past, aswell as your own limitation, I’m certain that you’d tell a story equal to yourpast memories and emotions—reaffirming yourself to be that way. You’d probablyeven embellish it a little. From a biological level, what you’d really beproclaiming is that you were altered physically, chemically, and emotionallyfrom that event several years ago and haven’t changed much since then. You’vechosen to be defined by your own limitation.In this example, one could say that you’re enslaved by your body (because it hasnow become the mind), you’re trapped by the conditions in your environment(because the experience of people and things at a certain place and time areinfluencing how you think, act, and feel), and you’re lost in time (because byliving in the past and anticipating the same future, your mind and body arenever in the present moment). So in order to change your current state of being,you’d have to be greater than these three elements: your body, your environment,and time.So, then, thinking back to the beginning of this chapter, where you read thatthe placebo is created from three elements—conditioning, expectation, andmeaning—you can now see that you are your own placebo. Why? Because all threeelements come into play in the previous example.First, like a talented animal trainer, you’ve conditioned your body into asubconscious state of being where mind and body are one—your thoughts andfeelings have merged—and your body has now been programmed to automatically,biologically, and physiologically be the mind by thought alone. And anytime astimulus from your external environment is presented to you—like an opportunityto teach—you’ve conditioned your body, just as Pavlov conditioned his dogs, tosubconsciously and automatically respond to the mind of the past experience.Since most of the placebo studies show that a single thought could activate thebody’s autonomic nervous system and produce significant physiological changes,then you’re regulating your internal world by simply associating a thought withan emotion. All of your subconscious, autonomic systems are being reinforcedneurochemically by the familiar feelings and bodily sensations related to yourfear—and your biology perfectly reflects it.Second, if your expectation is that your future will be like your past, then youare not only thinking in the past, but also selecting a known future based onlyon your past and emotionally embracing that event until your body (as theunconscious mind) believes that it’s living in that future in the presentmoment. All of your attention is on a known, predictable reality, which causesyou to limit any new choices, behaviors, experiences, and emotions. You’reunconsciously forecasting your future by physiologically clinging to the past.Third, if you assign meaning or conscious intention to an action, the result isamplified. What you’re telling yourself on a daily basis (in this case, thatyou’re not a good speaker and that public speaking elicits a panic reaction) iswhat has meaning to you. You’ve become susceptible to your own autosuggestions.And if your present knowledge is based on your own conclusions from pastexperiences, then without any new knowledge, you’ll always keep creating theoutcome that’s equal to your mind. Change your meaning and change yourintention, and just as the hotel maids in the study from the last chapter did,you change the results.So whether you’ve been trying to effect positive change to create a new state ofbeing or you’ve been running on autopilot and staying stuck in the same oldstate of being, the truth is that you’ve always been your own placebo.image [images/line1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Four [toc.html#a8]The Placebo Effect in the Body [toc.html#a8]On a crisp September day in 1981, a group of eight men in their 70s and 80sclimbed into a few vans headed two hours north of Boston to a monastery inPeterborough, New Hampshire. The men were about to take part in a five-dayretreat where they were asked to pretend that they were young again—or at least22 years younger than they were at the time. The retreat was organized by a teamof researchers, headed by Harvard psychologist Ellen Langer, Ph.D., who wouldtake another group of eight elderly men to the same place the following week.The men in the second group, the control group, were asked to actively reminisceabout being 22 years younger but not to pretend that they weren’t their currentage.When the first group of men arrived at the monastery, they found themselvessurrounded by all sorts of environmental cues to help them re-create an earlierage. They flipped through old issues of Life and the Saturday Evening Post, theywatched movies and television shows popular in 1959, and they listened torecordings of Perry Como and Nat King Cole on the radio. They also talked about“current” events, such as Fidel Castro’s rise to power in Cuba, Russian premierNikita Khrushchev’s visit to the United States, and even the feats of baseballstar Mickey Mantle and boxing great Floyd Patterson. All of these elements werecleverly designed to help the men imagine that they were really 22 yearsyounger.After each five-day retreat, the researchers took several measurements andcompared them to those they’d taken before the start of the study. The bodies ofthe men from both groups were physiologically younger, structurally as well asfunctionally, although those in the first study group (who pretended they wereyounger) improved significantly more than the control group, who’d merelyreminisced.1 [endnote.html#fnc-1]The researchers discovered improvements in height, weight, and gait. The mengrew taller as their posture straightened, and their joints became more flexibleand their fingers lengthened as their arthritis diminished. Their eyesight andhearing got better. Their grip strength improved. Their memory sharpened, andthey scored better on tests of mental cognition (with the first group improvingtheir score by 63 percent compared to 44 percent for the control group). The menliterally became younger in those five days, right in front of the researchers’eyes.Langer reported, “At the end of the study, I was playing football—touch, butstill football—with these men, some of whom gave up their canes.”2[endnote.html#fnc-2]How did that happen? Clearly, the men were able to turn on the circuits in theirbrains that reminded them of who they had been 22 years ago, and then their bodychemistry somehow magically responded. They didn’t just feel younger; theyphysically became younger, as evidenced by measurement after measurement. Thechange wasn’t just in their minds; it was in their bodies.But what happened in their bodies to produce such striking physicaltransformations? What could be responsible for all of these measurable changesin physical structure and function? The answer is their genes—which aren’t asimmutable as you might think. So let’s take some time to look at what exactlygenes are and how they operate.Demystifying DNAImagine a ladder or a zipper twisted into a spiral, and you’ll have a prettygood picture of what deoxyribonucleic acid (better known as DNA) looks like.Stored in the nucleus of every living cell in our bodies, DNA contains the rawinformation, or instructions, that makes us who and what we are (although aswe’ll soon see, those instructions are not an unchangeable blueprint that ourcells must follow for our entire lives). Each half of that DNA zipper containscorresponding nucleic acids that, together, are called base pairs, numberingabout three billion per cell. Groups of long sequences of these nucleic acidsare called genes.Genes are unique little structures. If you were to take the DNA out of thenucleus of just one cell in your body and stretch it out from end to end, itwould be six feet long. If you took all the DNA out of your entire body andstretched it out from end to end, it would go to the sun and back 150 times.3[endnote.html#fnc-3] But if you took all the DNA out of the almost seven billionpeople on the planet and scrunched it together, it would fit in a space as smallas a grain of rice.Our DNA uses the instructions imprinted within its individual sequences toproduce proteins. The word protein is derived from the Greek protas, meaning “ofprimary importance.” Proteins are the raw materials our bodies use to constructnot only coherent three-dimensional structures (our physical anatomy), but alsothe intricate functions and complex interactions that make up our physiology.Our bodies are, in fact, protein-producing machines. Muscle cells make actin andmyosin; skin cells make collagen and elastin; immune cells make antibodies;thyroid cells make thyroxine; certain eye cells make keratin; bone-marrow cellsmake hemoglobin; and pancreatic cells make enzymes like protease, lipase, andamylase.All of the elements that these cells manufacture are proteins. Proteins controlour immune system, digest our food, heal our wounds, catalyze chemicalreactions, support the structural integrity of our bodies, provide elegantmolecules to communicate between cells, and much more. In short, proteins arethe expression of life (and the health of our bodies). Take a look at Figure 4.1and review a simplistic understanding of genes.image [images/82.jpg]This is a very simplistic representation of a cell with DNA housed within thecell nucleus. The genetic material once stretched out into individual strandslooks like a twisted zipper or ladder called a DNA helix. The rungs of theladder are the nucleic acids that are paired together, which act as codes tomake proteins. A different length and sequence of the DNA strand is called agene. A gene is expressed when it makes a protein. Various cells of the bodymake different proteins for both structure and function.For the 60 years since James Watson, Ph.D., and Francis Crick, Ph.D., discoveredthe double helix of DNA, what Watson proclaimed in a 1970 issue of Nature4[endnote.html#fnc-4] as the “central dogma,” that one’s genes determine all, hasheld fast. As contradictory evidence popped up here and there, researcherstended to dismiss it as a mere anomaly within a complex system.5[endnote.html#fnc-5]Some 40-odd years later, the genetic-determinism concept still reigns in thegeneral public’s mind. Most people believe the common misconception that ourgenetic destiny is predetermined and that if we have inherited the genes forcertain cancers, heart disease, diabetes, or any number of other conditions, wehave no more control over that than we do our eye color or the shapes of ournoses (notwithstanding contact lenses and plastic surgery).The news media reinforce this by repeatedly suggesting that specific genes causethis condition or that disease. They’ve programmed us into believing that we’revictims of our biology and that our genes have the ultimate power over ourhealth, our well-being, and our personalities—and even that our genes dictateour human affairs, determine our interpersonal relationships, and forecast ourfuture. But are we who we are, and do we do what we do, because we’re born thatway? This concept implies that genetic determinism is deeply entrenched in ourculture and that there are genes for schizophrenia, genes for homosexuality,genes for leadership, and so on.These are all dated beliefs built on yesterday’s news. First of all, there’s nogene for dyslexia or ADD or alcoholism, for example, so not every healthcondition or physical variation is associated with a gene. And fewer than 5percent of people on the planet are born with some genetic condition—like type 1diabetes, Down syndrome, or sickle-cell anemia. The other 95 percent of us whodevelop such a condition acquire it through lifestyle and behaviors.6[endnote.html#fnc-6] The flip side is also true: Not everyone born with thegenes associated with a condition (say, Alzheimer’s or breast cancer) ends upgetting that. It’s not as though our genes are eggs that will ultimately hatchsomeday. That’s just not the way it works. The real questions are whether or notany gene we might be carrying has been expressed yet and what we’re doing thatmight signal that gene to turn either on or off.A huge shift in the way we look at genes came when scientists finally mapped thehuman genome. In 1990, at the beginning of the project, the researchers expectedthey’d eventually discover that we have 140,000 different genes. They came upwith that number because genes manufacture (and supervise the production of)proteins—and the human body manufactures 100,000 different proteins, plus 40,000regulatory proteins needed to make other proteins. So the scientists mapping thehuman genome were anticipating that they’d find one gene per protein, but by theend of the project, in 2003, they were shocked to discover that, in fact, humanshave only 23,688 genes.From the perspective of Watson’s central dogma, that’s not only not enough genesto create our complex bodies and keep them running, but also not even enoughgenes to keep the brain functioning. So if it’s not contained in the genes,where does all of the information come from that’s required to create so manyproteins and sustain life?The Genius of Your GenesThe answer to that question led to a new idea: Genes must work together insystemic cooperation with one another so that many are expressed (turned on) orsuppressed (turned off) at the same time within the cell; it’s the combinationof the genes that are turned on at any one time that produces all the differentproteins we depend on for life. Picture a string of blinking Christmas-treelights, with some flashing on together while others flash off. Or imagine a cityskyline at night—with the lights in the individual rooms in each buildingflipping on or off as the night progresses.This doesn’t happen randomly, of course. The entire genome or DNA strand knowswhat every other part is doing in an interconnected fashion that’s intimatelychoreographed. Every atom, molecule, cell, tissue, and system of the bodyfunctions at a level of energetic coherence equal to the intentional orunintentional (conscious or unconscious) state of being of the individualpersonality.7 [endnote.html#fnc-7] So it makes sense that genes can be activated(turned on) or deactivated (turned off) by the environment outside the cell,which sometimes means the environment inside the body (the emotional,biological, neurological, mental, energetic, and even spiritual states of being)and at other times means the environment outside the body (trauma, temperature,altitude, toxins, bacteria, viruses, food, alcohol, and so on).Genes are, in fact, classified by the type of stimulus that turns them on andoff. For example, experience-dependent or activity-dependent genes are activatedwhen we’re having novel experiences, learning new information, and healing.These genes generate protein synthesis and chemical messengers to instruct stemcells to morph into whatever types of cells are needed at the time for healing(more about stem cells and their role in healing will be coming up soon).Behavioral-state-dependent genes are activated during periods of high emotionalarousal, stress, or different levels of awareness (including dreaming). Theyprovide a link between our thoughts and our bodies—that is, they’re themind-body connection. These genes offer an understanding of how we can influenceour health in states of mind and body that promote well-being, physicalresilience, and healing.Scientists now believe it’s even possible that our genetic expression fluctuateson a moment-to-moment basis. The research is revealing that our thoughts andfeelings, as well as our activities—that is, our choices, behaviors, andexperiences—have profound healing and regenerative effects on our bodies, as themen in the monastery study discovered. Thus your genes are being affected byyour interactions with your family, friends, co-workers, and spiritualpractices, as well as your sexual habits, your exercise levels, and the types ofdetergents you use. The latest research shows that approximately 90 percent ofgenes are engaged in cooperation with signals from the environment.8[endnote.html#fnc-8] And if our experience is what activates a good number ofour genes, then our nature is influenced by nurturing. So why not harness thepower of these ideas so that we can do everything possible to maximize ourhealth and minimize our dependence on the prescription pad?As Ernest Rossi, Ph.D., writes in The Psychobiology of Gene Expression, “Oursubjective states of mind, consciously motivated behavior, and our perception offree will can modulate gene expression to optimize health.”9[endnote.html#fnc-9] Individuals can alter their genes during a singlegeneration, according to the latest scientific thinking. While the process ofgenetic evolution can take thousands of years, a gene can successfully alter itsexpression through a behavior change or a novel experience within minutes, andthen it may be passed on to the next generation.It helps to think of our genes less like stone tablets onto which our fate hasbeen ceremoniously carved and more like storehouses of an enormous amount ofcoded information or even massive libraries of possibilities for the expressionof proteins. But we can’t just call the stored information up to make use of itthe way a company might order something from its warehouse. It’s as if we don’tknow what’s in storage or how to access it, so we end up using just a smallportion of what’s truly available. In fact, we actually express only about 1.5percent of our DNA, while the other 98.5 percent lies dormant in the body.(Scientists called it “junk DNA,” but it’s not really junk—they just don’t knowhow all of that material is used yet, although they do know that at least someof it is responsible for making regulatory proteins.)“In reality, genes contribute to our characteristics but do not determine them,”writes Dawson Church, Ph.D., in his book The Genie in Your Genes. “The tools ofour consciousness—including our beliefs, prayers, thoughts, intentions, andfaith—often correlate much more strongly with our health, longevity, andhappiness than our genes do.”10 [endnote.html#fnc-10] The fact is, just asthere’s more to our bodies than a sack of bones and flesh, there’s more to ourgenes than just stored information.The Biology of Gene ExpressionNow let’s take a closer look at how genes are switched on. (Several differentfactors can be responsible, actually, but for the sake of our discussion hereabout the mind-body connection, we’ll keep it simple.)Once a chemical messenger (for example, a neuropeptide) from outside of the cell(from the environment) locks into the cell’s docking station and passes throughthe cell membrane, it travels to the nucleus, where it encounters the DNA. Thechemical messenger modifies or creates a new protein, and then the signal it wascarrying is translated to information now inside the cell. Then it enters thenucleus of the cell through a small window, and depending on the content of theprotein message, it looks for a specific chromosome (a single piece of coiledDNA that contains many genes) within the nucleus—just as you might look for aspecific book on the shelf in the library.Each of these strands is covered in a protein sleeve that acts as a filterbetween the information contained in the DNA strand and the rest of theintracellular environment of the nucleus. In order for the DNA code to beselected, the sleeve must be removed or unwrapped so that the DNA can be exposed(just as a book chosen from a library shelf then has to be opened before anyonecan read it). The genetic code of DNA contains information waiting to be readand activated to create a particular protein. Until that information is exposedin the gene by unwrapping that protein sleeve, the DNA is latent. It’s apotential storehouse of encoded information just waiting to be unlocked oropened. You could think of the DNA as a parts list of potentials that areawaiting instructions to construct proteins, which regulate and maintain everyaspect of life.Once the protein selects the chromosome, it opens it up by removing the outercovering around the DNA. Another protein then regulates and readies an entiregene sequence within the chromosome (think of it as a chapter within a book) tobe read, all the way from the start of the sequence to its end. Once the gene isexposed and the protein sleeve is removed and read, another nucleic acid, calledribonucleic acid (RNA), is produced from the regulatory protein reading thegene.Now the gene is expressed or activated. The RNA exits the nucleus of the cell tobe assembled into a new protein from the code the RNA carries. It has gone frombeing a blueprint of latent potential to being an active expression. The proteinthe gene creates can now construct, assemble, interact with, restore, maintain,and influence many different aspects of life both within the cell and outside ofit. Figure 4.2 gives an overview of the process.image [images/88.jpg]Figure 4.2A shows the epigenetic signal entering the cell receptor site. Oncethe chemical messenger interacts at the level of the cell membrane, anothersignal in the form of a new protein is sent to the nucleus of the cell to selecta gene sequence. The gene still has a protein covering protecting it from itsouter environment, and that covering has to be removed in order for it to beread.image [images/89.jpg]Figure 4.2B illustrates how the protein sleeve around the gene sequence of theDNA is opened so that another protein, called a regulatory protein, can unzipand read the gene at a precise location.image [images/90.jpg]Figure 4.2C demonstrates how the regulatory protein creates another molecule,called RNA, which organizes the translation and the transcription of thegenetically coded material into a protein.image [images/91.jpg]Figure 4.2D shows protein production. RNA assembles a new protein from theindividual building blocks of proteins called amino acids.Just as an architect gets all of the information that’s necessary to build astructure from a blueprint, the body gets all the instructions it needs tocreate complex molecules that keep us alive and operating from the chromosomesof our DNA. But before the architect reads the blueprint, it has to be pulledout of its cardboard tube and unrolled. Until then, it’s just latent informationwaiting to be read. The cell is the same way: The gene is inert until itsprotein sheathing is removed and the cell chooses to read the gene sequence.Scientists used to believe all the body needed was the information itself (theblueprint) to start construction, so that’s what most of them focused on. Theypaid little attention to the fact that the whole cascade of events starts withthe signal outside of the cell, which is, in fact, responsible for what geneswithin its library the cell chooses to read. That signal, as we now know,includes thoughts, choices, behaviors, experiences, and feelings. So it makessense that if you can change these elements, you can also determine your geneticexpression.Epigenetics: How We Mere Mortals Get to Play GodIf our genes don’t seal our fate and if they actually contain an enormouslibrary of possibilities just waiting to be taken off the shelf and read, thenwhat gives us access to those potentials—potentials that could have a hugeeffect on our health and well-being? The men in the monastery study surelygained such access, but how did they do it? The answer lies in a relatively newfield of study called epigenetics.The word epigenetics literally means “above the gene.” It refers to the controlof genes not from within the DNA itself but from messages coming from outsidethe cell—in other words, from the environment. These signals cause a methylgroup (one carbon atom attached to three hydrogen atoms) to attach to a specificspot on a gene, and this process (called DNA methylation) is one of the mainprocesses that turns the gene off or on. (Two other processes, covalent histonemodification and noncoding RNA, also turn genes on and off, but the details ofthose processes are more than we need for this discussion.)Epigenetics teaches that we, indeed, are not doomed by our genes and that achange in human consciousness can produce physical changes, both in structureand function, in the human body. We can modify our genetic destiny by turning onthe genes we want and turning off the ones we don’t want through working withthe various factors in the environment that program our genes. Some of thosesignals come from within the body, such as feelings and thoughts, while otherscome from the body’s response to the external environment, such as pollution orsunlight.Epigenetics studies all of these external signals that tell the cell what to doand when to do it, looking at both the sources that activate, or turn on, geneexpression (upregulating) and those that suppress, or turn off, gene expression(downregulating)—as well as the dynamics of energy that adjust the process ofcellular function on a moment-to-moment basis. Epigenetics suggests that eventhough our DNA code never changes, thousands of combinations, sequences, andpatterned variations in a single gene are possible (just as thousands ofcombinations, sequences, and patterns of neural networks are possible in thebrain).Looking at the entire human genome, so many millions of possible epigeneticvariations exist that scientists find their heads spinning just thinking aboutit. The Human Epigenome Project, begun in 2003 as the Human Genome Project drewto a close, is under way in Europe,11 [endnote.html#fnc-11] and some researchershave said that when it’s completed, it “will make the Human Genome Project looklike homework that 15th century kids did with an abacus.”12[endnote.html#fnc-12] Going back to the blueprint model, we can change the colorof what we build, the type of materials we use, the scale of the construction,and even the positioning of the structure—making an almost infinite number ofvariations—all without ever changing the actual blueprint.A great example of epigenetics at work involves identical twins, who shareexactly the same DNA. If we embrace the idea of genetic predeterminism—the ideathat all diseases are genetic—then identical twins should have exactly the samegene expression. However, they don’t always manifest the same illnesses in thesame way, and sometimes one will manifest a genetic disease that the otherdoesn’t manifest at all. Twins can have the same genes, but different outcomes.A Spanish study illustrates this perfectly. Researchers at the CancerEpigenetics Laboratory at the Spanish National Cancer Center in Madrid studied40 pairs of identical twins, ranging in age from 3 to 74. They found thatyounger twins who had similar lifestyles and spent more years together hadsimilar epigenetic patterns, while older twins, in particular those withdissimilar lifestyles who spent fewer years together, had very differentepigenetic patterns.13 [endnote.html#fnc-13] For example, researchers found fourtimes as many differentially expressed genes between one pair of 50-year-oldtwins as they did between a pair of 3-year-old twins.The twins were born with exactly the same DNA, but those with differentlifestyles (and different lives) ended up expressing their genes verydifferently—especially as time went on. To use another analogy, the older twinpairs were like exact copies of the same model of a computer. The computers cameloaded with some similar starter software, but as time went on, each downloadedvery different additional software programs. The computer (the DNA) stays thesame, but depending on what software a person has downloaded (the epigeneticvariations), what the computer does and the way it operates can be quitedifferent. So when we think our thoughts and feel our feelings, our bodiesrespond in a complex formula of biological shifts and alterations, and eachexperience pushes the buttons of real genetic changes within our cells.The speed of these changes can be truly remarkable. In just three months, agroup of 31 men with low-risk prostate cancer were able to upregulate 48 genes(mostly dealing with tumor suppression) and downregulate 453 genes (mostlydealing with tumor promotion) by following an intensive nutrition and lifestyleregimen.14 [endnote.html#fnc-14] The men, enrolled in a study by Dean Ornish,M.D., at the University of California at San Francisco, lost weight and reducedtheir abdominal obesity, blood pressure, and lipid profile over the course ofthe study. Ornish noted, “It is not really so much about risk-factor reductionor preventing something bad from happening. These changes can occur so quicklyyou don’t have to wait years to see the benefits.”15 [endnote.html#fnc-15]Even more impressive are the number of epigenetic changes made over a six-monthperiod in a Swedish study of 23 slightly overweight, healthy men who went frombeing relatively sedentary to attending spinning and aerobics classes an averageof just under twice per week. Researchers at Lund University discovered that themen had epigenetically altered 7,000 genes—almost 30 percent of all the genes inthe entire human genome!16 [endnote.html#fnc-16]These epigenetic variations may even be inherited by our children and thenpassed on to our grandchildren.17 [endnote.html#fnc-17] The first researcher toshow this was Michael Skinner, Ph.D., who was director of the Center forReproductive Biology at Washington State University. In 2005, Skinner led astudy that exposed pregnant rats to pesticides.18 [endnote.html#fnc-18] The malepups of the exposed mother rats had higher rates of infertility and decreasedsperm production, with epigenetic changes in two genes. These changes were alsopresent in about 90 percent of the males in each of the four generations thatfollowed, even though none of these other rats were exposed to any pesticides.Our experiences from our external environment are only part of the story,however. As we’ve been learning, how we assign meaning to those experiencesincludes a barrage of physical, mental, emotional, and chemical responses thatalso activate genes. How we perceive and interpret the data we receive from oursenses as factual information—whether that information is actually true ornot—and the meaning we give it produce significant biological changes on agenetic level. Thus, our genes interact with our conscious awareness in complexrelationships. We could say that meaning is continually affecting the neuralstructures that influence who we are on the microscopic level, which theninfluences who we are on the macroscopic level.The study of epigenetics also raises the question: What if nothing is changingin your external environment? What if you do the same things with the samepeople at exactly the same time every day—things leading to the same experiencesthat produce the same emotions that signal the same genes in the same way?We could say that as long as you perceive your life through the lens of the pastand react to the conditions with the same neural architecture and from the samelevel of mind, you’re headed toward a very specific, predetermined geneticdestiny. In addition, what you believe about yourself, your life, and thechoices you make as a result of those beliefs also keeps sending the samemessages to the same genes.Only when the cell is ignited in a new way, by new information, can it createthousands of variations of the same gene to rewrite a new expression ofproteins—which changes your body. You may not be able to control all theelements in your outer world, but you can manage many aspects of your innerworld. Your beliefs, your perceptions, and how you interact with your externalenvironment have an influence on your internal environment, which is still theexternal environment of the cell. This means that you—not your preprogrammedbiology—hold the keys to your genetic destiny. It’s just a matter of finding theright key that fits into the right lock to unleash your potential. So why notsee your genes for what they really are? Providers of possibility, resources ofunlimited potential, a code system of personal commands—in truth, they’renothing short of tools for transformation, which literally means “changingform.”Stress Keeps Us Living in Survival ModeStress is one of the biggest causes of epigenetic change, because it knocks yourbody out of balance. It comes in three forms: physical stress (trauma), chemicalstress (toxins), and emotional stress (fear, worry, being overwhelmed, and soon). Each type can set off more than 1,400 chemical reactions and produce morethan 30 hormones and neurotransmitters. When that chemical cascade of stresshormones is triggered, your mind influences your body through the autonomicnervous system and you experience the ultimate mind-body connection.Ironically, feeling stressed was designed to be adaptive. All organisms innature, including humans, are programmed to deal with short-term stress so thatthey’ll have the resources they need for emergency situations. When you sense athreat in your external environment, the fight-or-flight response in yoursympathetic nervous system (a subsystem of your autonomic nervous system) isactivated, and your heart rate and blood pressure increase, your muscles tense,and hormones like adrenaline and cortisol shoot through your body to prepare youto either flee or face your foe in battle.If you’re being chased by a pack of wild, hungry wolves or a party of violentwarriors, and you outrun them, your body will return to homeostasis (its normal,balanced state) soon after you reach safety. That’s the way our bodies weredesigned to operate when we’re living in survival mode. The body is out ofbalance—but only for a short period of time, until the danger passes. At least,that’s how it was meant to be.The same thing happens in our modern world, although the setting is usually alittle different. If someone cuts you off when you’re driving on the highway,you might be momentarily frightened, but once you realize that you’re okay andyou let go of the fear of having an accident, your body returns to normal—unlessthat was only one of countless stressful situations you stumbled into that day.If you’re like most people, a string of nerve-racking incidents keeps you infight-or-flight response—and out of homeostasis—a large part of the time. Maybethe car cutting you off is the only actual life-threatening situation youencounter all day, but the traffic on the way to work, the pressure of preparingfor a big presentation, the argument you had with your spouse, the credit-cardbill that came in the mail, the crashing of your computer hard drive, and thenew gray hair you noticed in the mirror keep the stress hormones circulating inyour body on a near-constant basis.Between remembering stressful experiences from the past and anticipatingstressful situations coming up in your future, all these repetitive short-termstresses blur together into long-term stress. Welcome to the 21st-centuryversion of living in survival mode.In fight-or-flight mode, life-sustaining energy is mobilized so that the bodycan either run or fight. But when there isn’t a return to homeostasis (becauseyou keep perceiving a threat), vital energy is lost in the system. You have lessenergy in your internal environment for cell growth and repair, long-termbuilding projects on a cellular level, and healing when that energy is beingchanneled elsewhere. The cells shut down, they no longer communicate with oneanother, and they become “selfish.” It’s not time for routine maintenance (letalone for making improvements); it’s time for defense. It’s every cell foritself, so the collective community of cells working together becomes fractured.The immune and endocrine systems (among others) become weakened as genes inthose related cells are compromised when informational signals from outside thecells are turned off.It’s like living in a country where 98 percent of the resources go towarddefense, and nothing is left for schools, libraries, road building and repair,communication systems, growing of food, and so on. Roads develop potholes thataren’t fixed. Schools suffer budget cuts, so students wind up learning less.Social welfare programs that took care of the poor and the elderly have to closedown. And there’s not enough food to feed the masses.Not surprisingly, then, long-term stress has been linked to anxiety, depression,digestive problems, memory loss, insomnia, hypertension, heart disease, strokes,cancer, ulcers, rheumatoid arthritis, colds, flu, aging acceleration, allergies,body pain, chronic fatigue, infertility, impotence, asthma, hormonal issues,skin rashes, hair loss, muscle spasms, and diabetes, to name just a fewconditions (all of which, by the way, are the result of epigenetic changes). Noorganism in nature is designed to withstand the effects of long-term stress.Several studies give strong evidence to show how epigenetic instructions forhealing shut down during emergencies. For example, researchers at the Ohio StateUniversity Medical Center found that more than 170 genes were affected bystress, with 100 of them shutting off completely (including many that directlymake proteins to facilitate the proper type of wound healing). The researchersreported that wounds of stressed patients took 40 percent longer to heal andthat “stress tilted the genomic balance towards genes [that were] encodingproteins responsible for cell-cycle arrest, death, and inflammation.”19[endnote.html#fnc-19] Another study examining the genes of 100 citizens ofDetroit zeroed in on 23 subjects who were suffering from post-traumatic stressdisorder.20 [endnote.html#fnc-20] These people had six to seven times moreepigenetic variations, most of which involved compromising the immune system.Researchers at the UCLA AIDS Institute found that not only did HIV spread fasterin patients who were the most stressed, but also the higher a patient’s stresslevel, the less he or she responded to the antiretroviral drugs. The drugsworked four times better for those patients who were relatively calm, comparedto those whose blood pressure, skin moisture, and resting heart rate indicatedthey were feeling the most stress.21 [endnote.html#fnc-21] Based on thesefindings, researchers concluded that the nervous system has a direct effect onviral replication.Although the fight-or-flight response was originally highly adaptive (because itkept early humans alive), it’s now clear that the longer that survival system isconstantly activated, the longer your body shunts its resources for creatingoptimal health, so the system becomes maladaptive.The Legacy of Negative EmotionsAs we keep making stress hormones, we create a host of highly addictive negativeemotions, including anger, hostility, aggression, competition, hatred,frustration, fear, anxiety, jealousy, insecurity, guilt, shame, sadness,depression, hopelessness, and powerlessness, just to name a few. When we focuson thoughts about bitter past memories or imagined dreadful futures to theexclusion of everything else, we prevent the body from regaining homeostasis. Intruth, we’re capable of turning on the stress response by thought alone. If weturn it on and then can’t turn it off, we’re surely headed for some type ofillness or disease—be it a cold or cancer—as more and more genes getdownregulated in a domino effect, until we eventually arrive at our geneticdestiny.For example, if we can anticipate a possible known future scenario and thenfocus on that thought to the exclusion of everything else even for just onemoment, the body will physiologically begin to change in order to prepare itselffor that future event. The body is now living in that known future in thepresent moment. As a consequence of this phenomenon, the conditioning processbegins to activate the autonomic nervous system, and it creates thecorresponding stress chemicals automatically. This is how the mind-bodyconnection can work against us.When this happens, we are demonstrating the three elements of the placebo effectin perfect symmetry. First, we start to condition the body to the rush ofadrenal chemistry in order to feel a boost of energy. If we can associate aperson, thing, or experience at a particular time and place in our outer realitywith that rush of chemistry within us, we’ll begin to condition the body to turnon the response just by thinking about that stimulus. In time, we’ll be able tosimply condition the body to be put in mind of that emotionally aroused state bythought alone—the thought of a potential experience with someone and somethingat some time and some place. If we can expect the future outcome based on thepast experience, then the expectation of the event, when we emotionally embraceit, will change the body’s physiology. And if we assign meaning to the behaviorsand experiences, we’re putting our conscious intention behind the outcome sothat our bodies will change or not change equal to what we think we know aboutour reality and ourselves.But whether or not you believe that the stress in your life is justified orvalid, the effect of that stress on the body is never advantageous or healthenhancing. Your body believes that it is being chased by a lion, is standingperched on a perilous cliff, or is fighting off a pack of angry cannibals. Hereare a few examples from scientific studies demonstrating the effects of stresson the body.Researchers at the Ohio State University College of Medicine confirmed thatstressful emotions trigger hormonal and genetic responses, by measuring howstress affects the speed of healing minor skin wounds—a significant marker ofgene activation.22 [endnote.html#fnc-22] A group of 42 married couples weregiven small suction blisters, and then their level of three proteins commonlyexpressed in wound healing was monitored for a total of three weeks. The coupleswere asked to have a neutral discussion for half an hour as a baseline and then,later, to talk about a previous marital argument.The researchers found that after the couples discussed a previous disagreement,their level of healing-linked proteins was mildly suppressed (showing that thegenes were downregulated). The suppression rose to an even greater degree—about40 percent—in couples whose discussion ballooned into a significant conflict,peppered with sarcastic comments, criticism, and put-downs.Research also supports the reverse effect—that reducing stress with positiveemotions triggers epigenetic changes that improve health. Two key studies byresearchers at the Benson-Henry Institute for Mind Body Medicine atMassachusetts General Hospital in Boston looked at the effects of meditation,which is known for eliciting peaceful and even blissful states, on geneexpression. In the first study, conducted in 2008, 20 volunteers received eightweeks of training in various mind-body practices (including several types ofmeditation, yoga, and repetitive prayer) known to induce the relaxationresponse, a physiological state of deep rest (discussed in Chapter 2[ch2.html]).23 [endnote.html#fnc-23] The researchers also followed 19 long-termdaily practitioners of the same techniques.At the end of the study period, the novices showed a change in 1,561 genes (874upregulated for health and 687 downregulated for stress), as well as reducedblood pressure and reduced heart and respiration rates, while the experiencedpractitioners expressed 2,209 new genes. Most of the genetic changes involvedimproving the body’s response to chronic psychological stress.The second study, conducted in 2013, found that eliciting the relaxationresponse produces changes in gene expression after just one session ofmeditation among both novices and experienced practitioners alike (with thelong-term practitioners, not surprisingly, deriving more benefit).24[endnote.html#fnc-24] Genes that were upregulated included those involved inimmune function, energy metabolism, and insulin secretion, while genes that weredownregulated included those linked to inflammation and stress.Studies like these underscore just how quickly it’s possible to change your owngenes. That’s why the placebo response can produce physical changes in a matterof moments. In my workshops around the world, my colleagues and I have witnessedsignificant and immediate changes in our participants’ health after only onesession of meditation. They transformed themselves and activated new genes innew ways by thought alone. (You’ll be introduced to some of them soon.)When we’re living in survival mode, with our stress response turned on all thetime, we can really focus on only three things: our physical bodies (Am Iokay?), the environment (Where is it safe?), and time (How long will this threatbe hanging over me?). Constantly focusing on these three things makes us lessspiritual, less aware, and less mindful, because it trains us to become moreself-absorbed and more focused on our bodies, as well as on other materialthings (such as what we own, where we live, how much money we have, and so on),in addition to all of the problems we experience in our external world. Thisfocus also trains us to obsess about time—to constantly brace ourselves for theworst-case future scenarios based on our traumatic past experiences—becausethere’s never enough time and everything always takes too much time.So we could say that just as stress hormones cause the cells of the body tobecome selfish to ensure that we survive, they endorse our ego to become moreselfish, too—and we become materialists defining reality with our senses. We endup feeling separate from any new possibilities, because when we never leave thatstate of chronic emergency, that me-first mentality that pervades all ourthinking strengthens and endures, leading us to become self-indulgent,self-serving, and self-important. Ultimately, the self becomes defined as a bodyliving in the environment and in time.As you have just read and now more fully understand, the reality is that you doindeed have some degree of control over your own genetic engineering—by way ofyour thoughts, choices, behaviors, experiences, and emotions. Like Dorothy inThe Wizard of Oz, who had the power she sought all along but didn’t know it, youalso possess a power that you may not have previously realized was yours—thekeys that can set you free of being chained to the limitations of your owngenetic expression.image [images/line1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Five [toc.html#a9]How Thoughts Change the Brain and the Body [toc.html#a9]Now you can understand that whether it’s joyful or stressful, with every thoughtyou think, every emotion you feel, and every event you experience, you’re actingas an epigenetic engineer of your own cells. You control your destiny. So thisraises another question: If your environment changes and you then program newgenes in new ways, is it possible—based on your perceptions and beliefs—toprogram the gene ahead of the actual environment? Feelings and emotions arenormally the end products of experiences, but can you combine a clear intentionwith an emotion that begins to give the body a sampling of the future experiencebefore it’s been made manifest?When you’re truly focused on an intention for some future outcome, if you canmake inner thought more real than the outer environment during the process, thebrain won’t know the difference between the two. Then your body, as theunconscious mind, will begin to experience the new future event in the presentmoment. You’ll signal new genes, in new ways, to prepare for this imaginedfuture event.If you continue to mentally practice enough times this new series of choices,behaviors, and experiences that you desire, reproducing the same new level ofmind over and over again, then your brain will begin to physicallychange—installing new neurological circuitry to begin to think from that newlevel of mind—to look as if the experience has already happened. You’ll beproducing epigenetic variations that lead to real structural and functionalchanges in the body by thought alone—just as do those who respond to a placebo.Then your brain and body will no longer be living in the same past; they’ll beliving in the new future that you created in your mind.This is possible through mental rehearsal. This technique is basically closingyour eyes and repeatedly imagining performing an action, and mentally reviewingthe future you want, all the while reminding yourself of who you no longer wantto be (the old self) and who you do want to be. This process involves thinkingabout your future actions, mentally planning your choices, and focusing yourmind on a new experience.Let’s go over this sequence in greater detail so we can more thoroughlyunderstand exactly what’s happening in mental rehearsal and how it works. As youmentally rehearse a destiny or dream about a new outcome, you imagine it overand over again until it becomes familiar to you. The more knowledge andexperience you have wired in your brain about the new reality you desire, themore resources you have to create a better model of it in your mental picturing,and so the greater your intention and expectation are (as with the hotel maids).You are “reminding” yourself of what your life will look like and feel like onceyou get what you want. Now you are putting an intention behind your attention.Then you consciously marry your thoughts and intentions with a heightened stateof emotion, such as joy or gratitude. (More on heightened states of emotion iscoming up.) Once you can embrace that new emotion and you get more excited,you’re bathing your body in the neurochemistry that would be present if thatfuture event were actually happening. It could be suggested that you’re givingyour body a taste of the future experience. Your brain and body don’t know thedifference between having an actual experience in your life and just thinkingabout the experience—neurochemically, it’s the same. So your brain and bodybegin to believe they’re actually living in the new experience in the presentmoment.By keeping your focus on this future event and not letting any other thoughtsdistract you, in a matter of moments, you turn down the volume on the neuralcircuits connected to the old self, which begins to turn off the old genes, andyou fire and wire new neural circuits, which initiates the right signals toactivate new genes in new ways. Thanks to the neuroplasticity discussedpreviously, the circuits in your brain begin to reorganize themselves to reflectwhat you’re mentally rehearsing. And as you keep coupling your new thoughts andmental images with that strong, positive emotion, then your mind and body areworking together—and you’re now in a new state of being.At this point, your brain and body are no longer a record of the past; they area map to the future—a future that you’ve created in your mind. Your thoughtshave become your experience, and you just became the placebo.A Few Mental-Rehearsal Success StoriesMaybe you heard that story a while back about a major who was imprisoned in aconcentration camp in Vietnam who mentally practiced playing golf on aparticular course every day to keep himself sane—only to shoot a perfect scorewhen he was finally released and returned home. Or perhaps you’ve heard theaccount of Soviet human-rights activist Anatoly Shcharansky, later known asNatan Sharansky, who spent more than nine years imprisoned in the Soviet Unionafter being falsely accused of spying for the United States in the 1970s.Sharansky—who spent 400 days of his prison term in a small, darkened,freezing-cold punishment cell—played a game of mental chess against himselfevery day, keeping track of the board coordinates and the positions of eachpiece in his mind. This enabled Sharansky to maintain many of his neural maps(which normally require external stimulation to stay intact). After his release,he immigrated to Israel and eventually became an Israeli cabinet minister. Whenworld chess champion Gary Kasparov came to Israel in 1996 to play a simultaneouschess match against 25 Israelis, Sharansky beat him.1 [endnote.html#fnd-1]Aaron Rodgers, quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, also imagines moves in hishead that he often later executes with precision on the field. Leading up to thePackers’ 2011 Super Bowl win, in a play-off game that the sixth-seeded Packerswon 48 to 21 against the top-seeded Atlanta Falcons, Rodgers completed 31 of 36passes (86.1 percent), the fifth-best postseason completion percentage of alltime.“In the sixth grade, a coach taught us about the importance of visualization,”Rodgers told a sports reporter for USA Today.2 [endnote.html#fnd-2] “When I’m ina meeting, watching film, or [lying] in bed before I go to sleep, I alwaysvisualize making those plays. A lot of those plays I made in the game, I hadthought about. As I [lay] on the couch, I visualized making them.” Rodgers wasalso able to successfully spin out of three potential sacks in that game, laternoting about those plays, “I visualized the majority before I made them.”Countless other professional athletes have also used mental rehearsal tostunning effect, including golfer Tiger Woods; basketball stars Michael Jordan,Larry Bird, and Jerry West; and baseball pitcher Roy Halladay. Champion golferJack Nicklaus wrote in his book Golf My Way:I never hit a shot, even in practice, without having a very sharp, in-focuspicture of it in my head. It’s like a color movie. First, I “see” the ball whereI want it to finish, nice and white and sitting up high on the bright-greengrass. Then the scene quickly changes, and I “see” the ball going there: itspath, trajectory, and shape, even its behavior on landing. Then there’s sort ofa fade-out, and the next scene shows me making the kind of swing that will turnthe previous images into reality. Only at the end of this short, private,Hollywood spectacular do I select a club and step up to the ball.3[endnote.html#fnd-3]As we can see from these examples alone (and there are many, many more just likethem), plenty of evidence shows that mental rehearsal is extremely effective forlearning a physical skill with minimal physical practice.I can’t resist adding one more example, this time from Jim Carrey, who tells anamazing story about what he did when he first came to Los Angeles in the late1980s as a struggling actor looking for work. He’d written a paragraph-longaffirmation on a piece of paper about meeting the right type of people, gettingthe right types of acting jobs, working on the right movie with the rightcasting, and being successful and contributing something worthwhile and making adifference in the world.He would go up to Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills every night and leanback in his convertible and look up at the sky. He’d say that paragraph tohimself, committing it to memory, as he imagined that what he was describing wasactually happening. And he wouldn’t drive back down from that Hollywood overlookuntil he felt as though he was the person he’d been imagining, until it feltreal for him. He even wrote a check to himself for $10 million, penning “foracting services rendered” on it and dating it “Thanksgiving 1995.” He carriedthe check in his wallet for years.Finally, in 1994, three movies were released that made Carrey a star. First, AceVentura: Pet Detective came out in February, followed by The Mask in July. Andfor his role in the third movie, Dumb and Dumber, released in December, Carreyreceived a check for exactly $10 million. He created exactly what he hadenvisioned for himself.What all of these individuals have in common is that they eliminated theexternal environment, got beyond their bodies, and transcended time so that theycould make significant neurological changes within. When they presentedthemselves to the world, they were able to get their minds and bodies to worktogether, and they created in the material world what they’d first conceived inthe mental realm.Scientific studies back this up. To start with, many experiments on mentalrehearsal prove that when you concentrate on a particular region of the body,your thoughts stimulate the region in the brain that governs that part4[endnote.html#fnd-4]—and if you keep doing it, physical changes in the brain’ssensory area will then follow. It makes sense, because if you keep placing yourawareness in the same place, you are firing and wiring the same networks ofneurons. And as a result, you’ll build stronger brain maps in that area.In a Harvard study, research subjects who’d never before played the pianomentally practiced a simple, five-finger piano exercise for two hours a day forfive days—and made the same brain changes as the subjects who physicallypracticed the same activities, but without ever lifting a finger.5[endnote.html#fnd-5] The region of their brains that controls finger movementsincreased dramatically, allowing their brains to look as though the experiencethey’d imagined had actually happened. They installed the neurological hardware(circuits) and software (programs), thereby creating new brain maps by thoughtalone.In another study of 30 people over a 12-week period, some regularly exercisedtheir little fingers, while others just imagined doing the same thing. While thegroup that actually did the physical exercises increased the strength of theirlittle fingers by 53 percent, the group that only imagined doing the same thingalso increased the strength of their little fingers—by 35 percent.6[endnote.html#fnd-6] Their bodies had changed to look as if they were having thephysical experience in external reality over and over again—but they onlyexperienced it in their minds. Their minds changed their bodies.In a similar experiment, ten volunteers each imagined flexing one of theirbiceps as hard as they could five times a week. Researchers recorded thesubjects’ electrical brain activity during the sessions and measured theirmuscle strength every two weeks. Those who only imagined flexing increased theirbicep muscle strength by 13.5 percent in just a few weeks, and they maintainedthe gain for three months after the training stopped.7 [endnote.html#fnd-7]Their bodies responded to a new mind.A final example is a French study that compared subjects who either lifted orimagined lifting dumbbells of different weights. Those who imagined liftingheavier weights activated their muscles more than did those who imagined liftinglighter weights.8 [endnote.html#fnd-8] In all three of these studies on mentalrehearsal, the subjects were able to measurably increase their body strengthusing only their thoughts.You may well wonder if studies exist showing what happens when we follow theentire sequence—when we not only imagine what we want to create, but alsoconnect with strong positive emotion. As a matter of fact, they do. And you’llbe reading about them soon enough.Signaling New Genes in the Body with a New MindTo understand more fully why mental rehearsal works, we need to look at just afew points of brain anatomy for a moment and then briefly add someneurochemistry. Let’s start by explaining that your frontal lobe, located rightbehind your forehead, is your creative center. This is the part of the brainthat learns new things, dreams of new possibilities, makes conscious decisions,sets your intentions, and so on. It’s the CEO, so to speak, and even more to thepoint, the frontal lobe also allows you to observe who you are and evaluate whatyou’re doing and how you’re feeling. It’s the home of your conscience. This isimportant, because once you become more aware of your thoughts, ultimately youcan better direct them.As you practice mental rehearsal and truly concentrate and focus on the outcomeyou want, the frontal lobe is your ally, because it also lowers the volume onthe outside world so that you’re not as distracted by information coming in fromyour five senses. Brain scans show that in a highly focused state, such asmental rehearsal, the perception of time and space diminishes.9[endnote.html#fnd-9] This happens because your frontal lobe dials down the inputfrom your sensory centers (which allow you to “feel” your body in space), yourmotor centers (responsible for your physical movement), and your associationcenters (where your thoughts about your identity and who you are live), as wellas your parietal-lobe circuits (where you process time). Because you can getbeyond your environment, beyond your body, and even beyond time, you’re betterable to make the thought you’re thinking more real than anything else.The moment you imagine a new future for yourself, think about a new possibility,and start to ask specific questions—such as What would it be like to livewithout this pain and limitation?—your frontal lobe snaps to attention. In amatter of seconds, it creates both an intention to be healthy (so you can getclear on what you want to create and what you no longer wish to experience) anda mental picture of being healthy so that you can imagine what it will be like.As the CEO, the frontal lobe has connections to all the other parts of thebrain. So it starts selecting networks of neurons to create a new state of mindas an answer to that question. You might say it becomes a symphony conductor,silencing your old hardwiring (the pruning function of neuroplasticity) andselecting different networks of neurons from different parts of the brain andwiring them together to create a new level of mind to reflect what you wereimagining. It’s your frontal lobe that changes your mind—that is, it makes thebrain work in different sequences, patterns, and combinations. Once the frontallobe can select different networks of neurons and seamlessly turn them on intandem to create a new level of mind, a picture or internal representationappears in your mind’s eye, or frontal lobe.Now let’s bring in some more neurochemistry. If your frontal lobe isorchestrating enough of these neural nets to fire in unison as you focus on aclear intention, there will come a moment when the thought will become theexperience in your mind—that’s when your inner reality is more real than yourouter reality. Once the thought becomes the experience, you begin to feel theemotion of how the event would feel in reality (remember, emotions are thechemical signatures of experiences). Your brain makes a different type ofchemical messenger—a neuropeptide—and it sends it out to the cells in your body.The neuropeptide looks for the appropriate receptor sites, or docking stations,on various cells so that it can deliver its message to the body’s hormonalcenters and, ultimately, the cells’ DNA—and the cells get a new message that theevent has occurred.When the DNA in a cell gets this new information from the neuropeptide, itresponds by turning on (or upregulating) some genes and turning off (ordownregulating) others, all to support your new state of being. Think of theupregulating and downregulating as lights either heating up and getting brighteror cooling off and getting dimmer. When a gene lights up, it’s activated to makea protein. When a gene turns off, it becomes deactivated and gets dimmer orweaker—and it doesn’t produce as many proteins. And we see the effects withmeasurable changes in our physical bodies.Take a look at Figure 5.1A and Figure 5.1B. They will help you follow the entiresequence of how to change your body by thought alone.image [images/113.jpg]image [images/114.jpg]In Figure 5.1A, the flowchart demonstrates how thoughts progress through acascade of simple mechanisms and chemical reactions in a downward causation tochange the body. By deduction, if new thoughts can create a new mind byactivating new neural networks, creating healthier neuropeptides and hormones(which signal the cells in new ways and epigenetically activate new genes tomake new proteins), and if the expression of proteins is the expression of lifeand is equal to the health of the body, then Figure 5.1B illustrates howthoughts can heal the body.Stem Cells: Our Potent Pool of PotentialsStem cells are the next layer we need to understand in the puzzle. They’re atleast partially responsible for how the seemingly impossible becomes possible.Officially, these are undifferentiated biological cells that become specialized.They’re raw potential. When these blank slates are activated, they morph intowhatever kind of cell the body needs—including muscle cells, bone cells, skincells, immune cells, and even nerve cells in the brain—in order to replaceinjured or damaged cells in the body’s tissues, organs, and systems. Think ofstem cells as scoops of shaved snow-cone ice before the flavored syrup is pumpedon top; lumps of clay waiting on the potter’s wheel for their turn to befashioned into plates, bowls, vases, or mugs; or maybe even a roll of silverduct tape that can fix a leaking pipe one day and be cleverly fashioned into aprom dress the next.Here’s an example of how stem cells work. When you cut your finger, the bodyneeds to repair the break in the skin. The local physical trauma sends a signalto your genes from outside the cell. The gene turns on and makes the appropriateproteins, which then instruct stem cells to turn into healthily functioning skincells. The traumatic signal is the information the stem cell needs todifferentiate into a skin cell. Millions of processes like this occur all overour bodies all the time. Healing attributable to this type of gene expressionhas been documented in the liver, muscles, skin, intestines, bone marrow, andeven the brain and the heart.10 [endnote.html#fnd-10]In wound-healing studies where the subject is in a highly emotional, negativestate like anger, the stem cells don’t get the message clearly. When there’sinterference in the signal, as with static on the radio, the potential celldoesn’t get the right stimulation in a coherent fashion to turn itself into auseful cell. As you know from reading the section about the stress response andliving in survival mode, the healing will take longer because most of the body’senergy is busy dealing with the angry emotion and its chemical effects. It’sjust not the time for creation, growth, and nurturing—it’s the time for anemergency.So when the placebo effect is at work, and you create the right level of mindwith a clear intention and combine it with a nurturing, elevated emotion, theright type of signal can reach the cell’s DNA. The message will not onlyinfluence the production of healthy proteins for better structure and functionof the body, but also make brand-new, healthy cells from latent stem cells thatare just waiting to be activated by the right message.You could even think of these stem cells as “get out of jail free” cards, as inthe game Monopoly, because once they’re picked up or activated, they replacecells in damaged areas of the body, allowing for a fresh, clean start. In fact,stem cells help explain how healing occurs in at least half the placebo casesinvolving sham surgery, whether it’s for an arthritic knee or a coronary bypass(as described in Chapter 1 [ch1.html]).How Intention and Elevated Emotion Change Our BiologyWe’ve already mentioned emotions and how they play a vital role in healing thebody, but now let’s take a deeper look at the subject. If we have a heightenedemotional response to the new thoughts we’re concentrating on in mentalrehearsal, it’s like turbocharging our efforts, because the emotions help usmake epigenetic changes much faster. We don’t need the emotional component;after all, the subjects who strengthened their muscles by imagining they werelifting weights didn’t need to get blissed out to change their genes. However,they inspired themselves by using their imaginations with each mental lift,saying, “Harder! Harder! Harder!” The consistent emotion was the energeticcatalyst that truly enhanced the process.11 [endnote.html#fnd-11] Maintainingsuch an elevated emotion allows us to get far more dramatic results much morequickly—the same kind of amazing results as we see in the placebo response.Remember the laughter study from Chapter 2 [ch2.html]? Japanese researchersfound that watching an hour-long comedy show upregulated 39 genes, 14 of whichwere related to natural killer cell activity in the immune system. Several otherstudies have shown increases in various antibodies after subjects watched ahumorous videotape.12 [endnote.html#fnd-12] Research at the University of NorthCarolina at Chapel Hill further showed that increased positive emotions producedincreases in vagal tone, a measure of the health of the vagus nerve, which playsa major part in regulating the autonomic nervous system and homeostasis.13[endnote.html#fnd-13] In a Japanese study, when baby rats were tickled for fiveminutes a day for five days in a row to stimulate positive emotion, the rats’brains generated new neurons.14 [endnote.html#fnd-14]In each of these cases, strong positive emotions helped the subjects triggerreal physical changes that improved their health. Positive emotions cause thebody and brain to flourish.Now look at the pattern of many of the placebo studies: The moment someonestarts getting a clear intention of a new future (wanting to live without painor disease) and then combines it with a heightened emotion (excitement, hope,and anticipation of actually living without pain or disease) is the moment thebody is no longer in the past. The body is living in that new future, because aswe’ve seen, the body doesn’t know the difference between an emotion created byan actual experience and one created by thought alone. So that heightened stateof emotion in response to the new thought is a vital component of that process,because it’s new information coming from outside the cell—and to the body, theexperience from the outer environment or inner environment is the same.Remember Mr. Wright from Chapter 1 [ch1.html]? He got very excited when hethought about taking the powerful new drug he’d heard about and imagined how itmight cure him. He was so excited that he badgered his doctor to allow him totake it. When he actually did, he had no idea that it was inert. But because hisbrain didn’t know the difference between his highly emotionally charged mentalimages of being well and actually being well, his body emotionally responded asif what he had imagined had already happened. His mind and his body were thenworking together to signal new genes in new ways, and that, rather than the“powerful new drug” he took, was what shrank his tumors and restored his health.That’s what created his new state of being.Then, when Mr. Wright learned that the drug trials showed that the drug didn’twork, he reverted back to his old thoughts and old emotions—to his oldprogramming—and not surprisingly, his tumors returned. His state of beingchanged once again. But when his doctors told him that he could get an improvedversion of the drug that had worked before, he got excited all over again. Hereally believed that this new version of the drug could work, because he’d seenit do so before (or at least that’s what he thought he’d seen).Naturally, when he reembraced the intention of health and started thinking newthoughts about possibility again, his brain went back to firing and wiring newneural connections, and he created a new mind. All his excitement and hopereturned, and that emotion created the very chemicals in his body that supportedhis new thoughts. And so once more, his body didn’t know the difference betweenhis thoughts and feelings about being well and actually being well. And oncemore, his brain and body responded as if what he’d imagined had alreadyhappened—and his tumors disappeared again.Once he read in the news that his “miracle drug” truly was a bust, he revertedto his old thinking and old emotions one final time—and his oldpersonality-self, along with his tumors, returned. There was no miracle drug—hewas the miracle. And there was no placebo—he was the placebo.So it makes sense that we should concentrate not merely on avoiding negativeemotions, like fear and anger, but also on consciously cultivating heartfelt,positive emotions, such as gratitude, joy, excitement, enthusiasm, fascination,awe, inspiration, wonder, trust, appreciation, kindness, compassion, andempowerment, to give us every advantage in maximizing our health.Studies show that getting in touch with positive, expansive emotions likekindness and compassion—emotions that are our birthright, by the way—tends torelease a different neuropeptide (called oxytocin), which naturally shuts offthe receptors in the amygdala, the part of the brain that generates fear andanxiety.15 [endnote.html#fnd-15] With fear out of the way, we can feelinfinitely more trust, forgiveness, and love. We move from being selfish toselfless. And as we embody this new state of being, our neurocircuitry opens thedoor to endless possibilities that we never could have even imagined before,because now we’re not expending all our energy trying to figure out how tosurvive.Scientists are finding areas in the body—like the intestines, the immune system,the liver, and the heart, as well as many other organs—that contain receptorsites for oxytocin. These organs are highly responsive to oxytocin’s majorhealing effect, which has been linked to growing more blood vessels in theheart,16 [endnote.html#fnd-16] stimulating immune function,17[endnote.html#fnd-17] increasing gastric motility,18 [endnote.html#fnd-18] andnormalizing blood-sugar levels.19 [endnote.html#fnd-19]Let’s return to mental rehearsal for a moment. Remember how the frontal lobe isour ally in mental rehearsal? That’s true because, as we established earlier,the frontal lobe helps us unplug from the body, the environment, and time—thethree main focuses of someone who’s living in survival mode. It helps us getpast ourselves to a state of pure consciousness, where we have no ego.In this new state, as we envision what we desire, our hearts are more open, andpositive emotion can flood through us so that now the loop of feeling what we’rethinking and thinking what we’re feeling is finally working in our favor. Theselfish mind-set we were in when we were in survival mode no longer exists,because the energy we channeled toward survival needs has now been freed up forus to create. It’s as though someone paid our rent or mortgage payment for themonth so that we have extra cash to play with.Now we can understand exactly why it is that if we hold a clear intention of anew future; marry it to a state of expansive, elevated emotion; and repeat thatover and over until we’ve created a new state of mind and a new state of being,these thoughts will seem more real to us than our previous, limited view ofreality. We’re finally free. And once we truly embrace that emotion, we can moreeasily fall in love with the possibility that we’ve been envisioning.The symphony conductor (frontal lobe) feels like a kid in a candystore—excitedly and joyfully seeing all sorts of creative possibilities for newneural connections that can combine to form new neural nets. And as theconductor unplugs us from the old state of being and switches on the circuits inthis new state of being, our neurochemicals begin delivering new messages to ourcells, which are now prepared to make epigenetic changes that signal new genesin new, empowering ways—and because we’ve used heightened emotions to make itseem as though it’s already happened, we’re signaling the gene ahead of theenvironment. Now we’re no longer waiting for the change and hoping for thechange—we are the change.Back to the MonasteryLet’s revisit the study from the beginning of the last chapter, where theelderly men pretended to be younger and actually got physically younger. Thequestion of how they did it has now been answered, and we’ve solved the mystery.When these men arrived at the monastery, they retreated from their familiarlives. They were no longer reminded of who they thought they were based on theirexternal environments. Then they began their retreat by holding a very clearintention: to pretend they were young again (using physical and mentalrehearsal, because both change the brain and the body) and to make it as real aspossible. As they watched the movies, read the magazines, and listened to radioand television programs from when they were 22 years younger, without modern-dayinterruptions, they were able to let go of the reality of being in their 70s and80s.They actually started living as though they were young again. As theyexperienced new thoughts and feelings about being younger, their brains startedfiring neurons in new sequences, new patterns, and new combinations—some ofwhich hadn’t been fired for 22 years. Because everything around the men, as wellas their own excited imaginations, joyfully supported them in making theexperience feel real, their brains couldn’t tell the difference between actuallybeing 22 years younger and just pretending that they were. So the men, in amatter of days, were able to start signaling the exact genetic changes toreflect who they were being.In doing that, their bodies produced neuropeptides to match their new emotions,and when the neuropeptides were unleashed, they delivered new messages to thecells in their bodies. As the appropriate cells allowed those chemicalmessengers in, they ushered them straight to the DNA deep inside each cell. Oncethey arrived there, new proteins were created, and these proteins looked for newgenes according to the information they were carrying. When they found what theywere looking for, the proteins unwrapped the DNA, switching on the gene that waslying in wait and triggering epigenetic changes. These epigenetic changesresulted in the production of new proteins that resembled the proteins of men 22years younger. If the men’s bodies didn’t happen to have the necessary parts tocreate whatever the epigenetic changes required, the epigenome simply calledupon stem cells to make what was needed.A cascade of physical improvements ensued as the men made more epigeneticchanges and switched on more genes, until finally, the men who waltzed back outthrough the monastery gates were no longer the same men who had shuffled throughthose gates just one week earlier.And if the process worked for these guys, I assure you that it can work for you,too. What reality do you choose to live in, and who are you pretending to be (ornot be)? Could it be that simple?image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Six [toc.html#a10]Suggestibility [toc.html#a10]Thirty-six-year-old Ivan Santiago stood patiently on a New York City street,along with a handful of paparazzi gathered behind a velvet rope outside aservice entrance to a four-star Lower East Side hotel. They were awaiting aforeign dignitary who was about to exit the building and jump into one of twoblack SUV limos waiting at the curb. But Santiago wasn’t clutching a camera. Onehand held a brand-new red backpack, while the other reached inside the partiallyunzipped bag and took hold of the grip of a pistol outfitted with a silencer.Santiago, an imposing Pennsylvania corrections officer with a bald head thatwould make Vin Diesel proud, knew a thing or two about deadly weapons. He’dnever had to fire one while on duty, but he was ready to fire one today.Moments before, Santiago had been on his way home, without a single thought ofguns, backpacks, foreign dignitaries, or assassination. But now here he was,finger on the trigger, brow knit into an intimidating scowl, and mere secondsfrom turning into a killer. The hotel door opened, and out sauntered his mark ina crisp, white dress shirt, sporting shades and carrying a leather briefcase.The man took only two or three strides toward the waiting limo before Santiagowhipped his gun out of the backpack and fired three times. The man fell to thesidewalk, motionless, his shirt stained red.Seconds later, a man named Tom Silver appeared out of nowhere, calmly put onehand on Santiago’s shoulder and his other on Santiago’s forehead, and said, “Onthe count of five, I’ll say, ‘Fully refreshed.’ Open your eyes and wake up. One,two, three, four, five! Fully refreshed!”Santiago had been hypnotized to shoot a stranger (actually a stuntman) usingwhat turned out to be a harmless Airsoft prop gun in an experiment run by ahandful of researchers who set out to test the unthinkable: Using hypnosis, wasit possible to program a law-abiding, all-around good person to become acold-blooded assassin?1 [endnote.html#fne-1]Hidden inside the SUV, eyes riveted to the scene, were the researchers workingwith Silver: Cynthia Meyersburg, Ph.D., then a postdoctoral fellow at Harvardspecializing in experimental psychopathology; Mark Stokes, Ph.D., aneuroscientist at Oxford who studies the neural pathways of decision making; andJeffery Kieliszewski, Ph.D., a forensic psychologist with Human ResourceAssociates in Grand Rapids, Michigan, who’s done work in super- maximum-securityprisons and hospitals for the criminally insane.The day before, the researchers had started out with a group of 185 volunteers.Silver (a certified clinical hypnotherapist and forensic-hypnosis investigationexpert who once helped the Taiwan Department of Defense bust open a $2.4 billioninternational arms-trading scandal) screened all 185 participants to determinehow suggestible they were to hypnosis. Only about 5 to 10 percent of thepopulation are considered very susceptible to hypnosis. In the test group, 16passed muster and were given a psychological evaluation to weed out those whomight suffer permanent psychological harm from the experiment. Eleven progressedto the next test, which determined whether, under hypnosis, they would rejectdeeply rooted social norms; this would show which were the most suggestible.Divided into smaller groups, the subjects were taken to a fairly busy restaurantfor lunch, but unbeknownst to them, they’d been given a posthypnotic suggestionthat once they sat down, their chairs would feel very hot, to the point wherethey’d quickly become so warm that they’d strip to their underwear—right therein the restaurant. While all of the subjects complied with the instructions tovarying degrees, the researchers eliminated seven who they felt either wereplaying along or just weren’t suggestible enough to fully follow the prompt. Theothers stripped to their underwear within seconds; they really thought theirchairs were extremely hot.The four who progressed to the next level were invited to take a test no onewould be able to fake. The subjects were to step into a deep metal bathtubfilled with 35°F ice water, just 3° above freezing. One at a time, the subjectswere wired to devices that monitored their heart rate, breathing rate, andpulse, while a special thermo-imaging camera monitored both their bodytemperature and the temperature of the water. Hypnotizing them, Silver told thesubjects they would feel no discomfort from the cold water and, in fact, wouldfeel as though they were stepping into a nice, warm bath. AnesthesiologistSekhar Upadhyayula administered the test as emergency medical technicians stoodby.This test would make or break the experiment. Normally, when someone is exposedto water this cold, an involuntary gasping reflex happens as the water reachesnipple level. The heart rate and respiratory rate climb, the person starts toshiver, and the teeth begin to chatter. It’s the autonomic nervous system takingover in an automatic attempt to maintain internal balance—something that’s notunder conscious control. Even if a person were in a deep state of hypnosis, theamount of sensation being sent to the brain under these extreme circumstanceswould normally be too overwhelming to maintain a hypnotic state. If any of thesubjects passed this test, they were indisputably suggestible to a very highdegree.Three of the subjects were indeed in deep states of hypnosis, but not deepenough to withstand this kind of intense cold without their bodies losinghomeostasis. The longest any of them could stay in the bath was 18 seconds. Butthe fourth subject, Santiago, stayed in for just over two full minutes beforeDr. Upadhyayula called a halt to the test.Although Santiago’s heart rate was high before the experiment, once he steppedinto the water, his heart rate calmed down immediately. There wasn’t so much asa flutter on his EKG or a single blip in his respiratory rate. Santiago satamong ice cubes as though he were soaking in a warm bathtub; indeed, that’sexactly what he believed he was doing. The man never flinched nor did his bodyfall into hypothermia, and the researchers knew they’d found the subject theywere looking for.Because Santiago was so suggestible under hypnosis that his body could overcomesuch an extreme environment for this amount of time and his mind could controlhis autonomic functions, he was ready for the final test.Santiago’s background check had shown he was a great guy, the researchers noted.He was a trusted employee, a devoted son, and a loving uncle. He was certainlynot the type of man who would agree to kill somebody in cold blood. Would Silversucceed in getting such a man to turn into an assassin?For this next phase of the experiment to be valid, Santiago couldn’t know whatwas being staged; he couldn’t make any connection between the experiments he wastaking part in and the scene in front of the hotel next to where the study wastaking place. As part of the plan, the television producers in charge of filmingthe experiments told him he hadn’t been selected to continue in the program,although they wanted him to return the next day for a short exit interview.Before Santiago left, he was told he wouldn’t be put under hypnosis again.Santiago returned the following day. While he was chatting with a producer, theteam went to work staging the scene outside. The stuntman strapped on bloodpacks; the Airsoft prop gun (which had the blast and recoil action of a realfirearm) was placed inside a red backpack and laid on the seat of a parkedmotorcycle right outside the entrance to the building. A velvet rope line wasset up outside the hotel service entrance, right next door, and staged paparazziwere in place with their film and video cameras. Two SUVs were parked on thestreet, looking ready to drive off with the “foreign dignitary” and hisentourage.Back upstairs, Santiago happily answered questions in his “exit interview,”until the producer excused herself for a moment, saying she’d be right back.Soon after she left the room, Silver entered, saying he wanted to say good-byeto Santiago. As Silver shook Santiago’s hand, he gave a little tug on his armthat prompted Santiago, by now well conditioned to this cue, to drop immediatelyinto a hypnotic trance. He went limp on the couch.Silver told him “a bad guy” was downstairs, adding, “He’s gotta be erased. We’vegot to get rid of him, and you’re the one to do it.” He told Santiago that oncehe exited the building, he’d see a red backpack on a motorcycle, and insidewould be a gun. He told Santiago that he was to grab the red backpack and walkover to the velvet rope, where he’d wait for the dignitary, who’d be carrying abriefcase, to emerge from the hotel. He told Santiago, “As soon as he comes outthe doors, you’re going to point the gun at his chest and fire that gun: Bang!Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! But as soon as you do it, you’ll simply, completely,totally forget that it ever happened.”Finally Silver implanted both an audible and a physical stimulation trigger thatwould send Santiago back into a hypnotic state, under which he’d follow theposthypnotic suggestion Silver had given him: He told Santiago that he’drecognize a segment producer outside the building, and the man would shake hishand and say, “Ivan, you did a spectacular job.” Silver told Santiago to nod“yes” if he’d do what Silver had instructed, and Santiago complied. Then Silverbrought him out of the trance and acted as if he were truly just sayinggood-bye.The producer returned to the room after Silver left and thanked Santiago,telling him the exit interview was over and he could leave. Soon after, Santiagoleft the building, thinking he was going home.Once he was outside, the segment producer walked up to him, shook his hand, andsaid, “Ivan, you did a spectacular job.” That was the trigger. Immediately,Santiago looked around, saw the motorcycle, walked over to it, and calmly pickedup the red backpack sitting on the seat. Seeing the velvet rope line and thepaparazzi, he walked over next to them and slowly unzipped the bag.In moments, a man carrying a briefcase strode out the door. Without flinching,Santiago pulled the gun out of the backpack and shot the man in the chestseveral times. The blood bags under the “dignitary’s” shirt erupted, and hedramatically collapsed to the ground.Silver almost immediately appeared on the scene and had Santiago close his eyes.The stuntman made a hasty exit as Silver then brought Santiago out of histrance. The psychologist Jeffery Kieliszewski appeared and suggested Santiagofollow him inside with the others for a debriefing. Once inside, the researcherstold a surprised Santiago what had happened and asked him if he had any memoryof what he’d done or what had just unfolded outside. Santiago didn’t remember athing—that is, until Silver suggested to him that he would.Programming the SubconsciousIn the first few chapters, you read about many different individuals whoaccepted a possible imagined scenario, and like magic, their bodies responded tothat picture in their minds: individuals who’d been trapped for years by theinvoluntary tremors of Parkinson’s disease but increased their dopamine levelsby thought alone, only to see their spastic paralysis mysteriously vanish; achronically depressed woman who, over time, physically changed her brain andtransmuted her debilitating emotional state into joy and well-being; asthmaticswho experienced a full-blown bronchial episode brought on by nothing more thanwater vapor, but then reversed their bronchial constriction in seconds byinhaling exactly the same water vapor; and, of course, the men with severe kneepain and compromised range of motion who miraculously improved after having shamknee surgery and remained healed years later.In all of these cases and more, it could be said that each subject firstaccepted and then believed in the suggestion of better health, and thensurrendered to the outcome without further analysis. When these people acceptedthe potential of recovery, they aligned themselves with a future possiblereality—and changed their minds and brains in the process. As they believed inthe outcome, they emotionally embraced the idea of better health, and as aresult, their bodies, as the unconscious mind, were living in that futurereality during the present moment.They conditioned their bodies to a new mind and so began to signal new genes innew ways and express new proteins for better health—and they moved into a newstate of being. Once they surrendered to a new possible scenario, they no longeranalyzed how it was going to happen or when it would manifest; they simplytrusted in a better state of being and maintained that new state of mind andbody for an extended period of time. It was that sustained state of being thatswitched on the right genes and programmed them to stay on.Whether they took a regimen of daily sugar pills lasting weeks or even months,received a single saline injection, or submitted to fake surgery, theseindividuals reaffirmed their acceptance, belief, and surrender for the durationof the study they participated in. If they were taking a pill daily to relievepain or depression, the pill was a constant reminder for them to condition,expect, and assign meaning to their intentional activity, thus reinforcing theinternal process over and over again. If it was a weekly visit to the hospitalto see a doctor and be interviewed about their improvement, the choice tointeract in a particular environment with doctors, nurses, equipment, andwaiting rooms triggered a host of sensory responses, and through associativememory, they were reminded of a possible new future. They were conditioned frompast experiences that the place called “a hospital” was where people went to getwell. They began to anticipate their future changes and, therefore, assignedintention to the whole healing process. Because all these factors had meaning,they helped make the placebo patients more suggestible to the outcomes theyexperienced.So now let’s address the elephant in the room: No real physical, chemical, ortherapeutic mechanisms made these changes happen. None of these people hadactual surgery, took active medication, or received any real treatment to createthese significant alterations in health. The power of their minds so influencedtheir bodies’ physiology that they became healed. It’s safe to say that theirreal transformation happened independent of their conscious minds. Theirconscious minds may have initiated the course of action, but the real workhappened subconsciously, with the subjects remaining totally unaware of how ithappened.The same is true of Ivan Santiago. The power of his mind under hypnosis soinfluenced his physiology that even when he was sitting in a freezing ice-cubebath, he didn’t so much as flinch. It was the power of his subconscious mindaltered by a mere suggestion, however, not his conscious mind, that wasresponsible for this feat. If he hadn’t accepted the suggestion, the outcomewould have been very different. In addition, he did what he did without thinkingabout how he was able to do it; in fact, in his mind, he wasn’t sitting in anice bath. He was sitting in a perfectly pleasant tub of warm water.So just as with hypnosis, the placebo effect is created by a person’sconsciousness somehow interacting with the autonomic nervous system. Quitesimply, the conscious mind merges with the subconscious mind. Once the placebopatients accept a thought as a reality, and then believe and trust in the endresult emotionally, the next thing that happens is that they get well.A cascade of physiological events automatically carries out the whole biologicalchange—without their conscious minds being involved. They’re able to enter theoperating system where these functions already happen routinely, and when theydo, it’s as if they’ve planted a seed in fertile ground. The systemautomatically takes over for them. In fact, it’s not anyone’s job to doanything. It just happens.None of the subjects could consciously spike dopamine levels by 200 percent andcontrol involuntary tremors with the mind, manufacture new neurotransmitters tocombat depression, signal stem cells to morph into white blood cells to mount animmune response, or restore knee cartilage in order to reduce pain—just asSantiago couldn’t have consciously avoided flinching when he lowered his bodyinto that tub. Anyone trying to accomplish any of these feats would certainly beunsuccessful. These people would have to get help from a mind that already knowshow to initiate all of these processes. To succeed, they’d have to activate theautonomic nervous system, the subconscious mind, and then assign it the task ofmaking new cells and healthy new proteins.Acceptance, Belief, and SurrenderI have mentioned the word suggestibility throughout this book as if beingsuggestible were something that all of us could simply do voluntarily oncommand. As you read in the story at the beginning of the chapter, it turns outthat it’s not that easy. Let’s face it. Some of us—certainly Ivan Santiago—aremore suggestible than others. And even those who are more suggestible respond tocertain suggestions better than other suggestions.For example, some of the hypnotism test subjects had no problem stripping totheir underwear in public when given that posthypnotic suggestion, yet they wereunable to subconsciously accept the idea that a tub of frigid ice water wasreally a warm Jacuzzi. This was true even though posthypnotic suggestions(including the suggestion that Santiago shoot the stranger) are generally moredifficult to make stick, compared to suggestions that alter someone’s statetemporarily during the hypnotic trance itself.And like hypnosis, the placebo response also doesn’t just work for everyone. Theplacebo patients you’ve read about who were able to make positive changes lastfor years (like the men who had the sham knee surgery) respond much likehypnotherapy subjects who’ve been given posthypnotic suggestions. For some, likethese men, such suggestions work beautifully. For others, not much happens.For instance, when they’re sick or suffering from a disease, many people simplycan’t accept the idea that even a drug, procedure, treatment, or injection canhelp them—let alone that a placebo might work. Why not? It takes thinkinggreater than how they feel—in turn allowing those new thoughts to drive newfeelings, which then reinforce those new thoughts—until it becomes a new stateof being. But if familiar feelings have become the means of familiar thinkingand the person can’t transcend that habituation, he or she is in the same paststate of mind and body, and everything stays the same.However, if those same people who can’t accept that a drug or procedure couldmake them well could reach a new level of acceptance and belief, and thensurrender to that end without constantly fretting, worrying, and analyzing, thenthey could reap greater rewards from the process. That’s what suggestibility is:making a thought into a virtual experience and having our bodies consequentiallyrespond in a new manner.Suggestibility combines three elements: acceptance, belief, and surrender. Themore we accept, believe, and surrender to whatever we’re doing to change ourinternal state, the better the results we can create. Similarly, when Santiagowas under hypnosis and his subconscious mind was in control, he could totallyaccept what Silver told him about the “bad guy” who needed to be eliminated, hecould believe that Silver was telling the truth, and he could surrender tocarrying out the detailed instructions Silver gave him, without ever analyzingor thinking critically about what he was about to do. There was no hand-wringingand asking for proof. There was no second-guessing. He just did it.Adding in EmotionSo when we are presented with the idea of better health, and we can associatethat hope or thought—that something outside of us is going to change somethinginside of us—with emotional anticipation of the experience, we’re becomingsuggestible to that end result. We condition, expect, and assign meaning to thewhole delivery system.But the emotional component is key in this experience; suggestibility isn’t justan intellectual process. Many folks can intellectualize being better, but ifthey can’t emotionally embrace the result, then they can’t enter into theautonomic nervous system (as Santiago did using hypnotism), which is vitalbecause that’s the seat of the subconscious programming that’s been calling allthe shots (as discussed in Chapter 3 [ch3.html]). In fact, it’s generallyaccepted in psychology that a person who experiences intense emotions tends tobe more receptive to ideas and is therefore more suggestible.The autonomic nervous system is under the control of the limbic brain, which isalso called the “emotional brain” and the “chemical brain.” The limbic brain,depicted in Figure 6.1, is responsible for subconscious functions like chemicalorder and homeostasis, for maintaining the body’s natural physiological balance.It’s your emotional center. So as you experience different emotions, youactivate this part of the brain, and it creates the corresponding chemicalmolecules of emotion. And since this emotional brain exists below the consciousmind’s control, the moment you feel emotion, you activate your autonomic nervoussystem.image [images/133.jpg]When you feel an emotion, you can ultimately bypass your neocortex—the seat ofyour conscious mind—and activate your autonomic nervous system. Therefore, asyou get beyond your thinking brain, you move into a part of the brain wherehealth is regulated, maintained, and executed.So if the placebo effect requires you to embrace an elevated emotion ahead ofthe actual experience of healing, then when you amplify your emotional response(and come out of your normal resting state), you’re activating your subconscioussystem. Allowing yourself to feel emotions is a way to enter the operatingsystem and program a change, because you’re now automatically instructing theautonomic nervous system to begin creating the corresponding chemistry as if youwere getting better. And the body receives a blend of those natural alchemicalelixirs from the brain and mind. As a result, the body is now becoming the mindemotionally.As we’ve seen, these can’t be just any emotions. The survival emotions that wealready explored in the last chapter knock the brain and body out of balance andso downregulate (or shut off) the genes needed for optimal health. Fear,futility, anger, hostility, impatience, pessimism, competition, and worry won’tsignal the proper genes for better health. They actually do the opposite. Theyturn on the fight-or-flight nervous system and prepare your body for emergency.You’re now losing vital energy for healing.It’s a similar situation with trying to make something happen, by the way. Themoment you’re trying, you’re pushing against something because you’reendeavoring to change it. You’re struggling, attempting to force an outcome,even if you don’t realize that’s what you’re actually doing. That knocks you outof balance, just as the survival emotions do, and the more frustrated andimpatient you become, the more out of balance you get. Remember in The EmpireStrikes Back, when Yoda said to Luke Skywalker that there is no try, only do (ordo not)? The same is true with the placebo response: There is no try; there’sonly allow.All those negative and stressful emotions are so familiar to us and connect toso many past known events that when we focus on them, those familiar emotionskeep the body connected to the same past conditions—which, in this case, is poorhealth. No new information can then program your genes in any new ways. Yourpast reinforces your future.On the other hand, emotions like gratitude and appreciation open your heart andlift the energy in your body to a new place—out of the lower hormonal centers.Gratitude is one of the most powerful emotions for increasing your level ofsuggestibility. It teaches your body emotionally that the event you’re gratefulfor has already happened, because we usually give thanks after a desirable eventhas occurred.If you bring up the emotion of gratitude before the actual event, your body (asthe unconscious mind) will begin to believe that the future event has indeedalready happened—or is happening to you in the present moment. Gratitude,therefore, is the ultimate state of receivership. Look at Figure 6.2 to reviewthe difference between the expression of survival emotions and the expression ofelevated emotions.image [images/135.jpg]Survival emotions are derived primarily from the stress hormones, which tend toendorse more selfish and more limited states of mind and body. When you embraceelevated, more creative emotions, you lift your energy to a different hormonalcenter, your heart begins to open, and you feel more selfless. This is when yourbody starts to respond to a new mind.If you can bring up the emotion of appreciation or thankfulness, and combine itwith a clear intention, you’re now beginning to embody the event emotionally.You’re changing your brain and body. Specifically, you’re chemically instructingyour body to know what your mind has philosophically known. We could say thatyou’re in a new future in the present moment. You’re no longer using familiar,primitive emotions to keep you anchored to the past; you’re now using elevatedemotions to drive you into a new future.Two Faces of the Analytical MindLet’s go back to the idea introduced earlier that we each have different levelsof our own acceptance to a suggestion, resulting in a spectrum ofsuggestibility. Everyone has his or her own level of susceptibility to thoughts,suggestions, and commands—from both outer and inner realities—based on manydifferent variables. Think of your level of suggestibility as being inverselyrelated to your analytical thinking (as illustrated in Figure 6.3): the greateryour analytical mind (the more you analyze), the less suggestible you are; andthe lesser your analytical mind, the more suggestible you are.image [images/136.jpg]The inverse relationship between the analytical mind and suggestibility.The analytical mind (or the critical mind) is that part of the mind youconsciously use and are aware of. It’s a function of the thinking neocortex—thepart of the brain that’s the seat of your conscious awareness; that thinks,observes, and remembers things; and that resolves problems. It analyzes,compares, judges, rethinks, examines, questions, polarizes, scrutinizes,reasons, rationalizes, and reflects. It takes what it has learned from pastexperience and applies it to a future outcome or to something it hasn’t yetexperienced.In the hypnosis experiment described at the start of this chapter, for example,7 of the 11 subjects given the posthypnotic suggestion to peel their clothes offin the public restaurant didn’t fully comply. It was the analytical mind thatbrought them “back to their senses.” The moment they began to analyze—Is thisright? Should I do this? What will I look like? Who’s watching? What will myboyfriend think?—the suggestion was no longer as powerful, and they returned totheir old, familiar state of being. The folks who immediately stripped to theirunderwear, on the other hand, did it without questioning what they were doing.They were less analytical (and so more suggestible) than their counterparts.Since the neocortex is divided into two halves called hemispheres, it makessense that we analyze and spend a lot of time thinking in duality: you know,good versus bad, right versus wrong, positive versus negative, male versusfemale, straight versus gay, Democrat versus Republican, past versus future,logic versus emotion, old versus new, head versus heart—you get the idea. And ifwe’re living in stress, the chemicals we’re pumping into our systems tend todrive the whole analytical process faster. We analyze even more in order topredict future outcomes so that we can protect ourselves from potentialworst-case scenarios based on past experience.There’s nothing wrong with the analytical mind, of course. It has served us wellfor our entire waking, conscious lives. It’s what makes us human. Its job is tocreate meaning and coherence between our outer worlds (the combined experiencesof people and things at different times and places) and our inner worlds (ourthoughts and feelings).The analytical mind works best when we’re calm, relaxed, and focused. This iswhen it’s working for us. It simultaneously reviews many aspects of our livesand provides us with meaningful answers. It helps us choose from myriad optionsin order to make decisions, learn new things, scrutinize whether to believe insomething, judge social situations based on our ethics, get clear on our purposein life, discern morality with conviction, and evaluate important sensory data.As an extension of our egos, the analytical mind also protects us so that we cancope and survive best in our external environments. (In fact, one of the ego’smain jobs is protection.) It’s always evaluating situations in the externalenvironment and assessing the landscape for the most advantageous outcomes. Ittakes care of the self, and it also tries to preserve the body. Your ego willlet you know when there’s potential danger, and it will urge you to respond tothe condition. For example, if you were walking down the street and saw theoncoming cars driving too close to the side of the road where you were walking,you might cross the street to protect yourself—that’s your ego giving you thatguidance.But when our egos are out of balance due to a barrage of stress hormones, ouranalytical minds go into high gear and become overstimulated. That’s when theanalytical mind is no longer working for us, but against us. We getoveranalytical. And the ego becomes highly selfish by making sure that we comefirst, because that’s its job. It thinks and feels as though it needs to be incontrol to protect the identity. It tries to have power over outcomes; itpredicts what it needs to do to create a certainly safe situation; it clings tothe familiar and won’t let go—so it holds grudges, feels pain and suffers, orcan’t get beyond its victimhood. It will always avoid the unknown condition andview it as potentially dangerous, because to the ego, the unknown is not to betrusted.And the ego will do anything to empower itself for the rush of addictiveemotions. It wants what it wants, and it will do whatever it takes to get therefirst, by pushing its way to the front of the line. It can be cunning,manipulative, competitive, and deceptive in its protection.So the more stressful your situation, the more your analytical mind is driven toanalyze your life within the emotion you’re experiencing at that particulartime. When this happens, you’re actually moving your consciousness further awayfrom the operating system of the subconscious mind, where true change can occur.You’re then analyzing your life from your emotional past, although the answersto your problems aren’t within those emotions, which are causing you to thinkharder within a limited, familiar chemical state. You’re thinking in the box.Then because of the thinking and feeling loop discussed earlier in the book,those thoughts re-create the same emotions and so drive your brain and bodyfurther out of order. You’ll be able to see the answers more easily when you getbeyond that stressful emotion and see your life from a different state of mind.(Stay tuned.)As your analytical mind is heightened, your suggestibility to new outcomesdecreases. Why? Because an impending emergency isn’t the time to be open-minded:entertaining new possibilities and accepting new potentials. It’s not the timeto believe in new ideas and openly let go and surrender to them. It’s not thetime to trust; instead, it’s the time to protect the self by measuring what youknow against what you don’t know in order to determine the greatest chances ofsurvival. It’s the time to flee from the unknown. So it makes sense that as theanalytical mind is endorsed by the stress hormones, you’ll narrow your thinking,be unlikely to trust and believe in anything new, and be less suggestible tobelieving in thought alone or in making any unknown thought known. Thus, you canuse the analytical mind or ego to work for you or against you.The Inner Workings of the MindThink of the analytical mind as a separate part of the conscious mind thatdivides it from the subconscious mind. Since the placebo works only when theanalytical mind is silenced so that your awareness can instead interact with thesubconscious mind—the domain where true change occurs—the placebo response ispossible only when you can get beyond your self and so eclipse your consciousmind with your autonomic nervous system.Look at Figure 6.4 for a simple illustration of this. Let the circle in thefigure represent the total mind. The conscious mind is only about 5 percent ofthe total mind. It’s made up of logic and reasoning as well as our creativeabilities. These aspects give rise to our free will. The other 95 percent of thetotal mind is the subconscious mind. This is the operating system where all ofthe automatic skills, habits, emotional reactions, hardwired behaviors,conditioned responses, associative memories, and routine thoughts and feelingscreate our attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions.image [images/140.jpg]This is an overview of the conscious mind, the analytical mind, and thesubconscious mind.The conscious mind is where we store our explicit, or declarative, memories.Therefore, declarative memories are memories that we can declare. They’re theknowledge we’ve learned (termed semantic memories) and experiences we’ve had inthis lifetime (episodic memories). You might be a woman who grew up inTennessee; who rode horses in childhood until you fell off and broke your arm;who had a pet tarantula at age 10 that escaped from its cage, requiring you andyour family to sleep at a hotel for two days; who won the state spelling bee atage 14 and now never misspells a word; who studied accounting in college inNebraska; who presently lives in Atlanta so that you can be near your sister(who took a job for a large corporation); and who is now getting a master’sdegree in finance online. Declarative memories are the autobiographical self.The other type of memories we have are implicit, or nondeclarative, memories,sometimes also called procedural memories. This kind of memory kicks in whenyou’ve done something so many times that you aren’t even consciously aware ofhow you do it. You’ve repeated it so often that now your body knows it as wellas your brain. Think of riding a bike, operating a clutch, tying your shoes,tapping a phone number or a PIN on a keypad, or even reading or speaking. Theseare the automatic programs that have been discussed throughout this book. Youcould say that you no longer have to analyze or consciously think about theskill or habit you’ve mastered, because it’s now subconscious. This is theprogrammed operating system, which is depicted in Figure 6.5.When you’ve mastered how to do something until it has become hardwired in yourmind and emotionally conditioned to your body, then your body knows how to do itas well as your conscious mind. You’ve memorized an internal neurochemical orderthat has become innate. The reason is simple: Repeated experience enriches thebrain’s neural networks and then finally seals the deal when it emotionallytrains the body. Once the event is neurochemically embodied enough times throughexperience, you can turn on the body and the corresponding automatic programjust by accessing a familiar subconscious thought or feeling—and then youmomentarily move into a particular state of being, which executes the automaticbehavior.image [images/142.jpg]Memory systems are divided into two categories: declarative memories (explicit)and nondeclarative memories (implicit).Since implicit memories are developed from the emotions of experience, twopossible scenarios explain how this unfolds: (1) A highly charged one-timeemotional event can be immediately branded and stored in the subconscious (forexample, a childhood memory of being in a big department store and gettingseparated from your mother), or (2) the redundancy of emotions derived fromconsistent experience will also be repeatedly logged there.Since implicit memories are part of the subconscious system of memory and arerouted there either by repeated experience or by highly charged emotionalevents, when you bring up any emotion or feeling, you’re opening a door to yoursubconscious mind. Since thoughts are the language of the brain and feelings arethe language of the body, the moment you feel a feeling, you’re turning on yourbody-mind (because your body has become your subconscious mind). You’ve justentered the operating system.Think about it like this: When you feel a certain familiar way, you’resubconsciously accessing a series of thoughts derived from that particularfeeling. You’re autosuggesting thoughts on a daily basis equal to how you feel.These are the thoughts you accept, believe, and surrender to as if they weretrue. Therefore, you’re more suggestible only to the thoughts that are matchedto exactly the same feeling. As a result, those thoughts that you unconsciouslythink about are the ones you accept, believe, and surrender to over and over.Conversely, it could also be said that you’re much less suggestible to anythoughts that are not equal to your memorized feelings. Any new thought thatreflects an unknown possibility just wouldn’t feel right. Your self-talk (thethoughts that you listen to every day) slips by your conscious awareness on amoment-to-moment basis and stimulates the autonomic nervous system and the flowof biological processes, reinforcing the programmed feeling of who you think youare. Remember the study in Chapter 2 [ch2.html], where researchers found thatoptimists responded more favorably to suggestions that were positive whilepessimists responded more unfavorably to suggestions that were negative.By the same means, if you were to change how you feel, could you become moresuggestible to a new stream of thoughts? Absolutely! By feeling an elevatedemotion and allowing a whole new set of thoughts to be driven by that newfeeling, you’d increase your level of suggestibility to what you were feelingand then thinking. You’d be in a new state of being, and your new thoughts wouldthen be the autosuggestions equal to that feeling. And when you feel emotions,you’re naturally activating your implicit memory system and the autonomicnervous system. You can simply allow the autonomic nervous system to do what itdoes best: restore balance, health, and order.Isn’t that what many people did in the placebo studies mentioned earlier?Weren’t they able to bring up an elevated emotion like hope or inspiration orthe joy of being well? And once they saw a new possibility without everanalyzing it, wasn’t their level of suggestibility influenced by those feelings?As they felt those corresponding emotions, didn’t they enter the operatingsystem and reprogram their autonomic nervous system with new orders—by thoughtalone—autosuggesting equal to those emotions?Opening the Door to the Subconscious MindIf there are different degrees of suggestibility, then that can be demonstratedvisually by showing different thicknesses of the analytical mind. The thickerthe barrier between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind, the moredifficulty you’ll have getting into the operating system.Take a look at Figures 6.6 and 6.7 on the following two pages, which representtwo people with different types of minds.The person in Figure 6.6 has a very thin veil between the conscious andsubconscious minds and therefore is very open to suggestion (like Ivan Santiagofrom the beginning of the chapter). This person will naturally accept, believe,and surrender to an outcome, because he or she doesn’t analyze orintellectualize too much. Folks like this might be more innately prone to acceptthat a thought is a potential experience and embrace it emotionally so that thepackage becomes imprinted on the autonomic nervous system, ready to be executedas a reality. These people don’t spend a lot of time trying to figure things outin their lives, and they don’t overthink many things. If you’ve ever seen ahypnosis stage show, the subjects who make it to the front of the room usuallyfall into this category.Now contrast this with Figure 6.7. If you look at the thicker analytical mindthat separates the conscious and subconscious minds, you can easily see thatthis person is less prone to taking suggestions at face value without asignificant degree of help from his or her intellectual mind in evaluating,processing, planning, and reviewing. People like this are highly critical andwill make sure they’ve analyzed everything before simply surrendering andtrusting.image [images/145.jpg]A less analytical mind (represented by the thinner layer in the illustration) ismore suggestible.Bear in mind that some of us have a more built-up analytical mind even withoutconstantly living by our stress hormones. We might have studied differentsubjects in college or lived with parents who reinforced the mechanisms ofrational thought when we were young, or maybe it’s just part of our nature.(Nevertheless, you can have a significantly broad analytical mind and stilllearn how to get beyond it—I certainly did—so there’s hope.)image [images/146.jpg]A more developed analytical mind (represented by the thicker layer in theillustration) is less suggestible.As I said before, neither of these types is more advantageous than the other. Ithink a healthy balance between the two works very well. Someone who’soveranalytical is less likely to trust and flow in his or her life. Someonewho’s overly suggestible might be too gullible and less functional. The point Iwant to make is that if you’re continually analyzing your life, judgingyourself, and obsessing about everything in your reality, then you’ll neverenter the operating system where those old programs exist and reprogram them.Only when a person accepts, believes, and surrenders to a suggestion does thedoor between the conscious and subconscious minds open. That information thensignals the autonomic nervous system and—presto!—it takes over.Now take a look at Figure 6.8. The arrow represents the movement ofconsciousness from the conscious mind into the subconscious mind, where thesuggestion is biologically embossed into the programming system.image [images/147.jpg]This figure represents the relationship between brain-wave states and themovement of awareness from the conscious mind to the subconscious mind, movingpast the analytical mind during the practice of meditation.A few additional elements can also silence the analytical mind and open the doorto the subconscious mind in order to increase a person’s level ofsuggestibility. For example, physical or mental fatigue increases yoursuggestibility. Certain studies have shown that the limited exposure to social,physical, and environmental cues in sensory deprivation can cause increasedsusceptibility. Extreme hunger, emotional shock, and trauma also weaken ouranalytical faculties, therefore making us more suggestible to information.Demystifying MeditationLike hypnosis, meditation is another way to bypass the critical mind and moveinto the subconscious system of programs. The whole purpose of meditation is tomove your awareness beyond your analytical mind—to take your attention off yourouter world, your body, and time—and to pay attention to your inner world ofthoughts and feelings.Many stigmas surround the word meditation. Most people conjure up images of abearded guru on a mountaintop, immune to the elements and sitting in perfectstillness; a monk in a simple robe, his face adorned with a huge, mysterioussmile; or even a young and beautiful woman, with flawless skin, on the cover ofa magazine, dressed in stylish yoga clothes and looking serenely free from theenslavement of all of the demands of daily life.When we see these images, many of us might perceive the discipline required astoo impractical, too out of reach, and beyond our abilities. We might seemeditation as a spiritual practice that doesn’t fit into our religious beliefs.And some of us are simply overwhelmed with the seemingly endless varieties ofmeditation available and are unable to decide where to begin. But it doesn’thave to be that difficult, “out there,” or confusing. For this discussion, let’sjust say that the whole purpose of meditation is to move our consciousnessbeyond the analytical mind and into deeper levels of consciousness.In meditation, we move not just from conscious mind to subconscious mind, butalso from selfish to selfless, from being somebody and someone to being no bodyand no one, from being a materialist to being an immaterialist, from being someplace to being no place, from being in time to being in no time, from believingthat the outer world is reality and defining reality with our senses tobelieving that the inner world is reality and that once we’re there, we enter“non-sense”: the world of thought beyond the senses. Meditation takes us fromsurvival to creation; from separation to connection; from imbalance to balance;from emergency mode to growth-and-repair mode; and from the limiting emotions offear, anger, and sadness to the expansive emotions of joy, freedom, and love.Basically, we go from clinging to the known to embracing the unknown.Let’s reason this for a moment. If your neocortex is the home of your consciousawareness and it’s where you construct thoughts, use analytical reasoning,exercise intellect, and demonstrate rational processes, then you’ll have to moveyour consciousness beyond (or out of) your neocortex in order to meditate. Yourconsciousness would have to essentially move from your thinking brain into yourlimbic brain and the subconscious regions. In other words, in order for you todial down your neocortex and all the neural activity that it performs on a dailybasis, you’d have to stop thinking analytically and vacate the faculties ofreason, logic, intellectualizing, forecasting, predicting, and rationalizing—atleast temporarily. This is what’s meant by “quieting your mind.” (Revisit Figure6.1, if you need to.)According to the neuroscientific model that I outlined in the previous chapters,to quiet your mind would mean that you’d have to declare a “cease-fire” on allof the automatic neural networks in your thinking brain that you habitually fireon a regular basis. That is, you’d have to stop reminding yourself of who youthink you are, repeatedly reproducing the same level of mind.I know that sounds like a huge task that may well be overwhelming, but it turnsout that practical, scientifically proven ways exist for us to accomplish thisfeat and make it a skill. In the workshops that I teach around the world, manyordinary people who’d never meditated before got pretty good at doing this—oncethey learned how. You’ll learn these methods in the chapters that follow, butfirst, let’s increase your level of intention so that when you get to thehow-to, you’ll reap greater rewards (just as did the aerobic exercisers inQuebec from Chapter 2 [ch2.html] who were told that their well-being would beenhanced by their efforts and, thus, could assign meaning to what they weredoing—and then got better results).Why Meditation Can Be So ChallengingThe analytical neocortex uses all of the five senses to determine reality. It’svery preoccupied with putting all of its awareness on the body, the environment,and time. And if you’re the least bit stressed, then your attention will bedirected to and will amplify all three of these elements. When you’re under thegun of the fight-or-flight emergency system and you switch on your adrenaline,just like any animal threatened in the wild, all of your attention will beplaced on taking care of your body, finding escape routes in your environment,and figuring out how much time you have to make it to safety. You overfocus onproblems, obsess about your looks, dwell on your pain, think about how littletime you have to do what you need to do, and rush to get things done. Soundfamiliar?Because you’re so hyperfocused on this external world and your problems in itwhen you’re living in survival, it’s easy to think that what you see andexperience is all there is. And without the external world, you’re no one, nobody, no thing, and in no place. How frightful that is for an ego that’s tryingto control all of its reality by constantly reaffirming an identity!It might make it easier if you remind yourself that when you’re living insurvival, what you sense is truly just the tip of the iceberg, only a limitedarray of ingredients making up your external world. You identify with the manyvariations and combinations in your external world that reflect back to you whoyou think you are—but that doesn’t mean there isn’t more. In fact, every timeyou learn something new, you change how you see the world. The world hasn’treally changed; only your perception of it has changed. (We’ll learn more aboutperception in the next chapter.)For now, it’s enough to keep in mind that if your goal is to effect change andyou haven’t been able to make it happen with all your external-world resources,then clearly you’ll need to look outside the limits of what you see, sense, andexperience for your answers. You’ll need to pull from other sources you haven’tyet identified—from the unknown. So in that sense, the unknown is your friend,not your foe. It’s the place where the answer lies.Another reason it becomes difficult for us to pull our attention away from allof the conditions of our outer world and place our attention on our inner worldis that most people are addicted to stress hormones—to feeling the rush ofchemicals that are the result of our conscious or unconscious reactions. Thisaddiction reinforces our belief that our outer world is more real than our innerworld. And our physiology is conditioned to support this, because real threats,problems, and concerns do exist that need our attention. So we become addictedto our present external environment. And through associative memory, we use theproblems and conditions in our lives to reaffirm that emotional addiction inorder to remember who we think we are.Here’s another way to say it: The stress hormones we experience while living insurvival mode give the body a high dose of energy and cause the fivesenses—which plug us into external reality—to become heightened. So naturally,if we’re continuously stressed, we’ll define reality with our senses. We becomematerialists. When we try to go within and connect with the world of “non-sense”and the immaterial, it takes some effort to break our conditioned habit and ouraddiction to the chemical rush we get from our external reality. How, then,could we possibly believe that thought is more powerful than physical,three-dimensional reality? If that’s how we see things, it becomes challengingto change anything by thought alone, because we’ve become enslaved to our bodiesand our environments.Maybe one antidote to that is rereading the stories in Chapter 1 [ch1.html]—andreading the stories from my workshops later, in Chapters 9 [ch9.html] and 10[ch10.html]. Reinforcing new information that shows us that what we think shouldbe impossible is indeed possible helps us remind ourselves that there’s more toreality than what our senses perceive. Whether we want to admit it or not, weare the placebo.Navigating Our Brain WavesIf meditation is about entering the autonomic system so that we can become moresuggestible and overcome the challenges just mentioned, then we need to know howto get there. The short answer is that we get there on a brain wave. The brainstate we happen to be in at any given time has a huge effect on how suggestiblewe are at that moment.Once you learn what these different states are and how to recognize them whenyou’re in them, you can train yourself to move from one state to another, up anddown the scale of brain-wave patterns. It takes some practice, of course, but itis possible. So let’s explore these different states to learn more about them.When neurons fire together, they exchange charged elements that then produceelectromagnetic fields, and these fields are what are measured during a brainscan (like an electroencephalograph, or EEG). Humans have several measurablebrain-wave frequencies, and the slower the brain-wave state we’re in, the deeperwe go into the inner world of the subconscious mind. In order of slowest tofastest, the brain-wave states are delta (deep, restorative sleep—totallyunconscious), theta (a twilight state between deep sleep and wakefulness), alpha(the creative, imaginative state), beta (conscious thought), and gamma (elevatedstates of consciousness).Beta is our everyday waking state. When we’re in beta, the thinking brain, orneocortex, is processing all of the incoming sensory data and creating meaningbetween our outer and inner worlds. Beta isn’t the best state for meditation,because when we’re in beta, the outer world appears more real than the innerworld. Three levels of brain-wave patterns make up the beta-wave spectrum:low-range beta (relaxed, interested attention, like reading a book), mid-rangebeta (focused attention on an ongoing stimulus outside the body, like learningand then remembering), and high-range beta (highly focused, crisis-modeattention, when stress chemicals are produced). The higher the beta brain waves,the further away we get from being able to access the operating system.Most days, we move back and forth between beta and alpha states. Alpha is ourrelaxation state, where we pay less attention to the outer world and start topay more attention to our inner world. When we’re in alpha, we’re in a lightstate of meditation; you could also call that imagination or daydreaming. Inthis state, our inner world is more real than our outer world, because that’swhat we’re paying attention to.When we go from high-frequency beta to slower alpha, where we can pay attention,concentrate, and focus in a more relaxed manner, we automatically activate thefrontal lobe. As the previous material has presented, the frontal lobe lowersthe volume on the brain circuits that process time and space. Here, we’re nolonger in survival mode. We’re in a more creative state that makes us moresuggestible than we were in beta.More challenging is learning how to drop down even further into theta, which isa kind of twilight state where we’re half-awake and half-asleep (often describedas “mind awake, body asleep”). This is the state we’re shooting for inmeditation, because it’s the brain-wave pattern where we’re the mostsuggestible. In theta, we can access the subconscious, because the analyticalmind isn’t operating—we’re mostly in our inner world.Think of theta as the key to your own subconscious kingdom. Take another look atFigure 6.8. It shows brain-wave states and how they correlate with the consciousand subconscious mind. Then take a look at Figure 6.9, which illustrates thedifferent brain-wave frequencies.You’ll find this brief tour through brain-wave patterns even more useful whenyou get to the practice of meditation, later in the book. Don’t expect thatyou’ll necessarily be able to drop right into theta on command, of course, buthaving some knowledge of what the various brain states are and what effect theyhave on what you’re trying to achieve will help.image [images/154.jpg]This illustration shows the different brain-wave states (during a one-secondinterval). Gamma brain-wave patterns are included because they represent a levelof super-awareness, which reflects a heightened state of consciousness.Anatomy of an “Assassination”Now let’s return to the story of Ivan Santiago and the other hypnosis subjectsfrom the start of this chapter. Obviously, these folks have an easier timegetting past their analytical minds than most of us. They seem to have both aneuroplasticity and an emotional plasticity that allow them to make their innerworlds more real than their outer worlds. In their normal waking states, theyprobably spend more time in alpha than in beta, so they have fewer stresshormones circulating that can pull them out of homeostasis. Their highlysuggestible states better enable their conscious minds to control the autonomicfunctions of their subconscious minds.Yet they’re not all the same; several different degrees of suggestibility weredemonstrated in this study. The 16 people who passed the initial evaluation werecertainly suggestible, although they weren’t all as suggestible as those whopassed the next test by taking their clothes off in public after being given aposthypnotic suggestion to do so, going against deeply rooted social norms. Thefour who passed that test were certainly highly suggestible, able to be greaterthan their social environment. But when it came to immersing themselves in theice water, three of those four couldn’t go that far; they weren’t able to begreater than their physical environment.Only Santiago, who remained greater than his physical environment in extremeconditions for an extended period of time while having dominion over his body,demonstrated the highest level of suggestibility. He was able not only towithstand the frigid ice bath, but also to be greater than his moralenvironment, by following the posthypnotic suggestion to shoot the “foreigndignitary,” despite the fact that his conscious personality was hardly one of acold-blooded killer.In terms of the placebo effect, it takes a similar high degree of suggestibilityto be greater than the body and greater than the environment for an extendedperiod of time—that is, to accept, believe, and surrender to the idea of yourinner world being more real than your outer world. But in just a few chapters,you’ll learn how you can not only change your beliefs and become moresuggestible, but also use that state to program your subconscious mind—not toshoot a stuntman with a prop gun, fortunately, but to triumph over whateverhealth issues, emotional traumas, or other personal matters you may be dealingwith.image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Seven [toc.html#a11]Attitudes, Beliefs, and Perceptions [toc.html#a11]A 12-year-old Indonesian boy with a vacant stare opens his mouth to willinglyaccept shards of broken glass from people in a crowd gathered in a Jakarta parkto watch traditional Javanese trance dancing called “kuda lumping.” The boychews on the glass and swallows it, as if it were nothing more than a handful ofpopcorn or pretzels, and he shows no ill effects. As a third-generation kudalumper, this youth has been ingesting glass in similar mystical performancessince he was nine. The boy and the other 19 members of his traditional dancetroupe recite a Javanese spell before every performance, summoning the spiritsof the dead to reside in one of them for the duration of that day’s dance,protecting that dancer from pain.1 [endnote.html#fnf-1]The boy and his fellow dancers are no different, in certain respects, from theAppalachian snake-handling preachers described in Chapter 1 [ch1.html] whobecome anointed with the spirit and enthusiastically dance around the pulpitwith venomous snakes coiled around their arms and shoulders. Bringing themdangerously close to their faces, they are seemingly immune to the venom ifbitten. The dancers are also similar to the Fijian firewalkers from the Sawautribe on the island of Beqa, who unflinchingly walk across white-hot stones thathave been covered in flaming logs and glowing red coals for hours, an abilitysaid to have been given to one of the tribe’s ancestors by a god and then passeddown within the tribe.The glass-eating boy, the snake-handling preacher, and the Fijian firewalkernever pause even for a moment to think, I wonder if it will work this time?There isn’t an ounce of wishy-washiness in any of them. The decision to chewglass or handle copperheads or tread on searing stones transcends their bodies,the environment, and time, altering their biology to allow them to do theseemingly impossible. Their rock-solid belief in the protection of their godsleaves no room for second-guessing.The placebo effect is similar in that very strong beliefs are part of theequation. Yet this component hasn’t been examined much, because up to this pointin mind-body research, most scientific studies have measured only the effects ofthe placebo instead of looking for the cause. Whether the shift in one’sinternal state has been the product of faith healing, conditioning, the releaseof suppressed emotions, a belief in symbols, or a specific spiritual practice,the question still remains: What has happened to create such profoundalterations in the body—and if we discover what that is, can we cultivate it?Where Our Beliefs Come FromOur beliefs aren’t always as conscious as we think they are. We may very wellaccept an idea on the surface, but if deep down, we don’t really believe it’spossible, then our acceptance is just an intellectual process. Because callingupon the placebo effect requires us to truly change our beliefs about ourselvesand what’s possible for our bodies and our health, we need to understand whatbeliefs are and where they come from.Let’s suppose a person goes to the doctor with certain symptoms and is diagnosedwith a condition based on the physician’s objective findings. The doctor givesthe patient a diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options based on the averageoutcome. The moment the person hears the doctor say “diabetes,” “cancer,”“hypothyroidism,” or “chronic fatigue syndrome,” a series of thoughts, images,and emotions is conjured up based on his or her past experience. That experiencecould be that the patient’s parents had the condition, that he or she saw a showon TV in which one of the characters died of that disease, or even thatsomething the person read on the Internet scared him or her about the diagnosis.Once the patient sees the doctor and hears a professional opinion, the patientautomatically accepts the condition, then believes what the confident doctor hassaid, and finally surrenders to the treatment and possible outcomes—and this isdone without any real analysis. The patient is suggestible (and susceptible) towhat the doctor says. If the person then embraces the emotions of fear, worry,and anxiety, along with sadness, then the only possible thoughts (orautosuggestions) are those that are equal to how he or she feels.The patient can try to have positive thoughts about beating the disease, but hisor her body still feels bad because the wrong placebo has been given, resultingin the wrong state of being, the signaling of the same genes, and the inabilityto see or perceive any new possibilities. The patient is pretty much at themercy of his or her beliefs (and the beliefs of the doctor) about the diagnosis.So when people like the folks you’ll read about in the next few chapters healedthemselves using the placebo effect, what did they do differently? First, theydidn’t accept the finality of their diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment. Nor didthey believe in the most probable outcome or future destiny that their doctorshad authoritatively outlined. Finally, they didn’t surrender to the diagnosis,prognosis, or suggested treatment. Because they had a different attitude fromthose who did accept, believe, and surrender, they were in a different state ofbeing.They weren’t suggestible to the doctors’ advice and opinions, because theydidn’t feel fearful, victimized, or sad. Instead they were optimistic andenthusiastic, and those emotions drove a new set of thoughts, which enabled themto see new possibilities. Because they had different ideas and beliefs aboutwhat was possible, they didn’t condition their bodies to the worst-casescenario, they didn’t expect the same predictable outcome as others who’dreceived the same diagnosis, and they didn’t assign the same meaning to thediagnosis as everyone else with the same condition. They assigned a differentmeaning to their future, so they had a different intention. They understoodepigenetics and neuroplasticity, so instead of passively seeing themselves asvictims of the disease, they used that knowledge to become proactive, fueled bywhat they’d learned in my workshops and events. As a result, these folks alsogot different and better results than other people who’d received the samediagnosis—just as the hotel maids got better results after the researchers gavethem more information.Now think about the average person who receives a diagnosis and promptlyannounces, “I’m going to beat this.” Someone may not accept the condition andthe outcome the doctor outlines, but the difference is that most people haven’ttruly changed their beliefs about not being sick. Changing a belief requireschanging a subconscious program—since a belief, as you’ll soon learn, is asubconscious state of being.Folks who use only their conscious minds to change never come out of the restingstate to reprogram their genes, because they don’t know how to do that. This iswhere their healing stops. They’re unable to surrender to possibility, becausethey’re not truly able to become suggestible to anything different from what thedoctor tells them.Is it possible that, whenever people don’t respond to treatment or when theirhealth stays the same, they’re living by the same emotional state every day,accepting, believing, and surrendering to the medical model without too muchanalysis, based on the social consciousness of millions of other people who’vedone exactly the same thing? Does a doctor’s diagnosis become the modern-dayequivalent of a voodoo curse?So now, let’s dissect belief a little further, backing up just slightly to beginwith the following idea: When you string a succession of thoughts and feelingstogether so that they ultimately become habituated or automatic, they form anattitude. And since how you think and feel creates a state of being, attitudesare really just shortened states of being. They can fluctuate from moment tomoment as you alter how you think and feel. Any particular attitude can last forminutes, hours, days, or even a week or two.For example, if you have a series of good thoughts that are aligned with aseries of good feelings, you might say, “I have a good attitude today.” And ifyou have a sequence of negative thoughts that’s connected to a sequence ofnegative feelings, then you might say, “I have a bad attitude today.” If yourevisit the same attitude enough times, then it becomes automatic.If you repeat or maintain certain attitudes long enough and you string thoseattitudes together, that’s how you create a belief. A belief is just an extendedstate of being—essentially, beliefs are thoughts and feelings (attitudes) thatyou keep thinking and feeling over and over again until you hardwire them inyour brain and emotionally condition them into your body. You could say that youbecome addicted to them, which is why it’s so hard to change them and why itdoesn’t feel good on a gut level when they’re challenged. Because experiencesare neurologically etched into your brain (causing you to think) and chemicallyembodied as emotions (causing you to feel), most of your beliefs are based onpast memories.So when you revisit the same thoughts over and over by thinking about andanalyzing what you remember from your past, these thoughts will fire and wireinto an automatic unconscious program. And if you cultivate the same feelingsbased on past experiences and you feel the same as you did when the eventoriginally occurred, you’ll condition your body to subconsciously be the mind ofthat emotion—and your body will unconsciously be living in the past.And if the redundancy of how you think and feel over time conditions your bodyto become the mind, and it becomes programmed subconsciously, then beliefs aresubconscious and also unconscious states of being derived from the past. Beliefsare also more permanent than attitudes; they can last for months or even years.And because they last longer, they become more programmed within you.A case in point is a story from my childhood that’s stamped in my memory. I grewup in an Italian family, and when I was going into fourth grade, we moved toanother city that had a mixture of both Italian and Jewish residents. On myfirst day of school that year, the teacher assigned me to a seat in a group ofsix desks along with three Jewish girls. That was the day the girls broke thenews to me that Jesus wasn’t Italian. It was one of the most memorable days ofmy life.When I came home that afternoon, my little Italian mother kept asking me how myfirst day of school went, and I wouldn’t talk to her. After I ignored her enoughtimes, she finally grabbed me by the arm and insisted I tell her what was wrong.“I thought Jesus was Italian!” I blurted out angrily.“What are you talking about?” she responded. “He’s Jewish!”“Jewish?” I shot back. “What do you mean? He looks Italian in all thosepictures, doesn’t he? Grandma talks in Italian to him all day long. And what’sthe deal with the Roman Empire? Isn’t Rome in Italy?”So the belief that I had—that Jesus was Italian—was based on my pastexperiences, and how I thought and felt about Jesus had become my automaticstate of being. This belief took some getting over, because changing deep-seatedbeliefs isn’t easy. Needless to say, I succeeded.Now let’s move the concept forward a little further. If you string a group ofrelated beliefs together, they form your perception. So your perception ofreality is a sustained state of being that’s based on your long-standingbeliefs, attitudes, thoughts, and feelings. And since your beliefs becomesubconscious and also unconscious states of being (that is, you don’t even knowwhy you believe certain things, or you aren’t really conscious of your beliefsuntil they’re tested), your perceptions—how you subjectively see things—for themost part, become your subconscious and unconscious view of your reality fromthe past.In fact, scientific experiments have shown that you don’t see reality as ittruly is. Instead, you unconsciously fill in your reality based on your memoriesof the past, which is what’s neurochemically maintained in your brain.2[endnote.html#fnf-2] When perceptions become implicit or nondeclarative (as wasdiscussed in the last chapter), they become automatic or subconscious so thatyou automatically edit reality subjectively.For example, you know your car is your car, because you’ve driven it so manytimes. You have the same experience of your car daily, because nothing muchchanges about it. You think and feel the same way about it most every day. Yourattitude about your car has created a belief about it, which has formed aparticular perception about your vehicle—that it’s a good car, say, because itrarely breaks down. And although you automatically accept that perception, it’sactually a subjective perception, because someone else may have the same makeand model of car as you do, and that person’s car may break down all the time,causing him or her to have a different belief and different perceptions aboutthe same vehicle based on personal experience.In fact, if you’re like most people, you probably don’t pay attention to severalaspects of your car unless something goes wrong. You expect it to run as it didthe day before; you naturally expect your future experience of driving your carto be like your past experience, yesterday and the day before—that’s yourperception. But when it malfunctions, you have to pay more attention to it (likelistening to the sound of the motor more closely) and become conscious of yourunconscious perception of your car.Once your perception of your car is altered because something has changed aboutthe way it drives, you’ll now perceive your car differently. The same is true ofrelationships with your spouse and your co-workers, your culture and your race,and even your body and your pain. Actually, this is the way most perceptionsabout reality function.Now, if you want to change an implicit or subconscious perception, you mustbecome more conscious and less unconscious. In truth, you’d have to increaseyour level of attention to all of the aspects of yourself and your life thatyou’ve previously stopped paying much attention to. Better yet, you’d have towake up, change your level of awareness, and become conscious of what you wereonce unconscious about.But it’s rarely that easy, because if you experience the same reality over andover again, then the way you think and feel about your current world willcontinue to develop into the same attitudes, which will inspire the samebeliefs, which will expand into the same perceptions (as shown in Figure 7.1).image [images/164.jpg]Your thoughts and feelings come from your past memories. If you think and feel acertain way, you begin to create an attitude. An attitude is a cycle ofshort-term thoughts and feelings experienced over and over again. Attitudes areshortened states of being. If you string a series of attitudes together, youcreate a belief. Beliefs are more elongated states of being and tend to becomesubconscious. When you add beliefs together, you create a perception. Yourperceptions have everything to do with the choices you make, the behaviors youexhibit, the relationships you chose, and the realities you create.When your perception becomes so second nature and so automatic that you reallydon’t pay attention to the way reality truly is (because you automaticallyexpect everything to be the same), you’re now unconsciously accepting andagreeing to that reality—the way most people unconsciously accept and agree towhat the medical model tells them about a diagnosis.So the only way to change your beliefs and perceptions in order to create aplacebo response is to change your state of being. You have to finally see yourold, limited beliefs for what they are—records of the past—and be willing to letgo of them so that you can embrace new beliefs about yourself that will help youcreate a new future.Changing Your BeliefsSo then ask yourself: What beliefs and perceptions about you and your life haveyou been unconsciously agreeing to that you’d have to change in order to createthis new state of being? This is a question that requires some thought, becauseas I said, with many of these beliefs, we aren’t even aware that we believethem.Often, we accept certain cues from our environment that then prime us to acceptcertain beliefs, which may or may not be true. Either way, the moment we acceptthe belief, it has an effect not only on our performance, but also on thechoices we make.Remember the study from Chapter 2 [ch2.html] about the women taking the mathtest who first read fake research reports about men being better than women inmath? Those who’d read that the advantage was due to genetics scored lower thanthose who’d read that the advantage was due to stereotyping. Although bothreports were false—men are no better at math than women—the women in the groupwho’d read that they had a genetic disadvantage believed what they’d read andthen scored lower. It was the same with the white men who were told that Asiansscore slightly better than whites on a test they were about to take. In bothcases, when the students were primed to unconsciously believe they wouldn’tscore as well, they in fact didn’t—even though what they were told was totallyfalse.With this in mind, take a look at this list of some common limiting beliefs andsee which ones you may be harboring without being fully aware that you’re doingso:I’m not good at math. I’m shy. I’m short-tempered. I’m not smart or creative.I’m a lot like my parents. Men shouldn’t cry or be vulnerable. I can’t find apartner. Women are lesser than men. My race or culture is superior. Life isserious. Life is difficult, and no one cares. I’m never going to be a success. Ihave to work hard to make it in life. Nothing good ever happens to me. I’m not alucky person. Things never go my way. I never have enough time. It’s someoneelse’s responsibility to make me happy. When I own this particular thing, thenI’ll be happy. It’s hard to change reality. Reality is a linear process. Germsmake me sick. I gain weight easily. I need eight hours of sleep. My pain isnormal, and it’ll never go away. My biological clock is ticking. Beauty lookslike this. Having fun is frivolous. God is outside of me. I’m a bad person, soGod doesn’t love me. . . .I could go on forever, but you get the idea.Since beliefs and perceptions are based on past experiences, then any of thesebeliefs that you happen to hold about yourself came from your past. So are theytrue, or did you just make them up? Even if they were true at some point intime, that doesn’t necessarily mean that they’re true now.We don’t look at it that way, of course, because we’re addicted to our beliefs;we’re addicted to the emotions of our past. We see our beliefs as truths, notideas that we can change. If we have very strong beliefs about something,evidence to the contrary could be sitting right in front of us, but we may notsee it because what we perceive is entirely different. We’ve in fact conditionedourselves to believe all sorts of things that aren’t necessarily true—and manyof these things are having a negative impact on our health and happiness.Certain cultural beliefs are a good example. Remember the story about the voodoocurse from Chapter 1 [ch1.html]? The patient was convinced he was going to die,because the voodoo priest had put a hex on him. The hex only worked because he(and others in his culture) believed voodoo to be true—it wasn’t the voodoo thathad hexed him; it was the belief in the voodoo.Other cultural beliefs can cause premature deaths. For instance, ChineseAmericans who have a disease, combined with a birth year that Chinese astrologyand Chinese medicine consider to be ill fated, die up to five years early,according to researchers at the University of California at San Diego whostudied the death records of almost 30,000 Chinese Americans.3[endnote.html#fnf-3] The effect was stronger in those who were more attached toChinese traditions and beliefs, and the results also held consistent for nearlyall major causes of death studied. For example, Chinese Americans born in yearsassociated with susceptibility to diseases involving lumps and tumors died oflymphatic cancer four years younger than Chinese Americans born in other yearsor than non—Chinese Americans with similar cancers.As these examples demonstrate, we’re suggestible only to what we consciously orunconsciously believe to be true. An Eskimo who doesn’t believe in Chineseastrology is no more suggestible to the idea that he’s vulnerable to a certaindisease because he was born in the year of the tiger or the year of the dragonthan an Episcopalian would be suggestible to the idea that a hex from a voodoopriest could kill him or her.But once any of us accepts, believes, and surrenders to an outcome withoutconsciously thinking about it or analyzing it, then we’ll become suggestible tothat particular reality. In most people, such a belief is planted well beyondthe conscious mind into the subconscious system, which is what creates thedisease. So now let me ask you another question: How many personal beliefs basedon cultural experiences do you have that may not be true?Changing beliefs may be difficult, but it’s not impossible. Just think whatwould happen if you were able to successfully challenge your unconsciousbeliefs. Instead of thinking and feeling, I never have enough time to geteverything done, what if you instead thought and felt, I live in “no-time,” andI accomplish everything? What if instead of believing, The universe isconspiring against me, you believed, The universe is friendly and works in myfavor? What a great belief! How would you think, how would you live, and howwould you walk down the street if you believed the universe works in your favor?How do you think that would change your life?When you change a belief, you have to start by first accepting that it’spossible, then change your level of energy with the heightened emotion you readabout earlier, and finally allow your biology to reorganize itself. It’s notnecessary to think about how that biological reorganization will happen or whenit’s going to happen; that’s the analytical mind at work, which pulls you backinto a beta brain-wave state and makes you less suggestible. Instead, you justhave to make a decision that has finality. And once the amplitude or energy ofthat decision becomes greater than the hardwired programs in your brain and theemotional addiction in your body, then you are greater than your past, your bodywill respond to a new mind, and you can effect real change.You already know how to do this. Think about a time in your past when you madeup your mind to change something about yourself or your life. If you recall, amoment came when you probably said to yourself, I don’t care how I feel [body]!It doesn’t matter what’s going on in my life [environment]! And, I’m notconcerned how long it will take [time]! I’m going to do this!Instantly, you got goose bumps. That’s because you moved into an altered stateof being. The moment you felt that energy, you were sending your body newinformation. You felt inspired, and you came out of your familiar resting state.That’s because, by thought alone, your body moved from living in the same pastto living in a new future. In reality, your body was no longer the mind; youwere the mind. You were changing a belief.The Effect of PerceptionLike beliefs, our perceptions of past experiences—whether positive ornegative—directly affect our subconscious state of being and our health. In1984, Gretchen van Boemel, M.D., then associate director of clinicalelectrophysiology at Doheny Eye Institute in Los Angeles, uncovered a strikingexample of this when she noticed a disturbing trend among Cambodian womenreferred to Doheny. The women, all between the ages of 40 and 60 and living innearby Long Beach, California (known as Little Phnom Penh because of its roughly50,000 Cambodian residents), were having severe vision problems, includingblindness, in disproportionately high numbers.Physically, the women’s eyes were perfectly healthy. Dr. van Boemel did brainscans on the women to evaluate how well their visual systems were functioningand compared them to how well their eyes were seeing. She found that each of thewomen had perfectly normal visual acuity, often 20/20 or 20/40, although whenthey tried to read an eye chart, their vision tested at legally blind. Some ofthe women had absolutely no light perception and couldn’t even detect anyshadows—even though there wasn’t anything physically wrong with their eyes.When Dr. van Boemel teamed up with Patricia Rozée, Ph.D., of California StateUniversity, Long Beach, to do research on the women, they found that those whohad the worst vision had spent the most time living under the Khmer Rouge or inrefugee camps when communist dictator Pol Pot was in power.4[endnote.html#fnf-4] The genocide perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge was responsiblefor the deaths of at least 1.5 million Cambodians between 1975 and 1979.Of the women studied, 90 percent had lost family members (some as many as ten)during that time, and 70 percent were forced to watch their loved ones—sometimeseven their entire families—being brutally murdered. “These women saw things thattheir minds just could not accept,” Rozée told the Los Angeles Times.5[endnote.html#fnf-5] “Their minds simply closed down, and they refused to seeanymore—refused to see any more death, any more torture, any more rape, any morestarvation.”One woman was forced to watch her husband and four children be killed right infront of her, and she lost her sight immediately afterward. Another woman had towatch a Khmer Rouge soldier beat her brother and his three children to death,which included seeing her three-month-old nephew being thrown against a treeuntil he died. She started losing her eyesight right after that.6[endnote.html#fnf-6] The women also suffered beatings, starvation, untoldhumiliations, sexual abuse, torture, and 20-hour days of enforced labor.Although now they were safe, many of these women told the researchers that theypreferred to stay in their homes, where they had to relive their memories of theatrocities over and over through recurring nightmares and intrusive thoughts.Documenting a total of 150 cases of psychosomatic blindness in Cambodian womenin Long Beach—the largest known group of such victims anywhere in the world—vanBoemel and Rozée presented their research at the 1986 American PsychologicalAssociation annual meeting in Washington, D.C. The audience was riveted.The women in this study became blind or nearly blind not because of some eyedisease or physical malfunction, but because the events they lived through hadsuch an emotional impact that they literally “cried until they could not see.”7[endnote.html#fnf-7] The heightened emotional amplitude from being forced tobear witness to the unbearable left them not wanting to see anymore. The eventcreated physical changes in their biology—not in their eyes, but most likely intheir brains—which altered their perception of reality for the rest of theirlives. And because they kept replaying the traumatizing scenes over and over intheir minds, their vision never improved.While this is certainly an extreme example, our past traumatic experiencesprobably have similar effects on us. If you’re having vision challenges, whatthings might you have chosen not to see because of painful or frightening pastexperiences? Similarly, if you’re having hearing challenges, what in your lifemight you be unwilling to hear?Figure 7.2 charts how all of this happens. The line in the chart reflects arelative measurement of a person’s state of being, which starts out at a more orless normal or baseline level before the event occurs. When the line spikes, itindicates a strong emotional reaction to an event—such as when the womenexperienced the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge soldiers. That horrific experienceneurologically branded their brains and chemically changed their bodies, as wellas altered their state of being—their thoughts, their feelings, their attitudes,their beliefs, and ultimately their perceptions. Specifically, the women nolonger wished to look at the world anymore, so through neurological rewiring andchemical resignaling, their biology complied.image [images/171.jpg]A highly charged experience in our external reality will impress itself upon thecircuitry of the brain and emotionally brand the body. As a result, the brainand body live in the past, and the event alters our state of being, as well asour perception of reality. We are no longer the same personality.Although the line in the graph eventually falls and levels off, the place whereit ends up is a different place from where it began—indicating that the personremains chemically and neurologically altered by the experience. At that pointfor the Cambodian women, they were effectively living in the past, because theyremained affected by the neurological and chemical branding that had come fromthe experience. They were no longer the same women; the event changed theirstate of being.The Power of the EnvironmentJust changing your beliefs and perceptions once isn’t enough. You have toreinforce that change over and over. To see why, let’s return for a moment tothe Parkinson’s patients mentioned earlier who improved their motor skills afterreceiving a saline injection that they thought was a powerful drug.As you’ll recall, the moment they moved into a state of better health, theirautonomic nervous systems started to endorse this new state by producingdopamine in their brains. That didn’t happen because they were praying or hopingor wishing their bodies would make dopamine; it happened because they becamepeople who made dopamine.Unfortunately, however, the effect doesn’t stick for everyone. In fact, forsome, the placebo effect only lasts for a certain amount of time, because theygo back to who they were before: their old states of being. In this case, whenthe Parkinson’s patients went back home and saw their caregivers, saw theirspouses, slept in the same beds, ate the same food, sat in the same rooms, andmaybe played chess with the same friends who complained about their pains, theirsame old environments reminded them of their same old personalities and theirsame old states of being. All of the conditions in their familiar lives remindedthem of who they were before, so they just slipped right back into thoseidentities, and their various motor problems recurred.8 [endnote.html#fnf-8]They reidentified with their environments. The environment is that strong.The same thing happens with drug addicts who’ve been clean for many years. Ifyou put them back in their same environments where they used to do drugs, evenwithout their ingesting any drug, being there turns on the same receptor sitesin their cells that the drugs did when they were using—and that in turn createsphysiological changes in their bodies as if they’ve taken the drugs, increasingtheir cravings.9 [endnote.html#fnf-9] Their conscious minds have no control overthat. It’s automatic.Let’s examine this concept a bit further. You’ve learned that the conditioningprocess creates strong associative memories. You’ve also learned thatassociative memories stimulate subconscious automatic physiological functions byactivating the autonomic nervous system. Think of Pavlov’s dogs again. OncePavlov conditioned the dogs to associate the bell with getting fed, the dogs’bodies were immediately physiologically changed, without much control from theconscious mind. It was the cue from the environment that (via associativememory) automatically, autonomically, subconsciously, and physiologicallychanged the dogs’ internal states. They began to salivate and their digestivejuices turned on, because they were anticipating a reward. The dogs’ consciousminds couldn’t do that. It was the stimulus from the environment that createdthe associative memory from the conditioned response.Now let’s revisit the Parkinson’s patients and the former drug users. We couldsay that the instant any one of these individuals returned to the familiarenvironment, the body would automatically and physiologically return back to theold state of being—without the conscious mind having much control over it. Infact, that past state of being, which has been thinking and feeling the same wayfor years on end, has conditioned the body to become the mind. That is, the bodyis the mind that responds to the environment. That’s why it’s so hard for anyonein this situation to change.And the greater the addiction to the emotion, the greater the conditionedresponse is to the stimulus in the environment. For example, let’s say you wereaddicted to coffee and wanted to break your addiction to it. If you werevisiting my house and I started making a java, and you heard the blast of theespresso machine, smelled the coffee brewing, and saw me drinking it, here’swhat would happen: The moment your senses picked up those cues from theenvironment, your body, as the mind, would subconsciously, automatically respondwithout much help from your conscious mind—because you conditioned it to be thatway. Your body-mind would then be craving its physiological reward, waging a waragainst your conscious mind, trying to convince you to take a sip or two.But if you truly broke the addiction to coffee and then I made a cup in front ofyou, you could have some or not, because you wouldn’t have the physiologicalresponse you had previously. You’d no longer be conditioned (your body would nolonger be the mind), and the associative memory of your environment would nolonger have the same effect on you.The same holds true for emotional addictions. For instance, if you havememorized guilt from your past experiences and unconsciously live that way everyday in the present, then like most people, you’ll use someone or something atsomeplace in your external environment to reaffirm your addiction to guilt. Tryas you might to be consciously greater than it, the moment you see your mother(whom you use to feel guilty) at the house where you grew up, your body willautonomically, chemically, and physiologically return to the same past state ofguilt in the present moment, without your conscious mind being involved. Yourbody, which has been subconsciously programmed to be the mind of guilt, isalready living in the past in that present moment. So it’s more natural to feelguilty when you’re with your mother than to feel any other way. And just as inthe drug addict, a conditioned response has altered your internal state based onyour association with your present-past external reality. Break the addiction toguilt by changing the subconscious programming, and you can be in the presenceof the same conditions and remain free from your present-past reality.Researchers from the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand examinedthe effect of environment using a group of 148 college students who were invitedto take part in a study set in a bar-like atmosphere.10 [endnote.html#fnf-10]The researchers told half the students that they would get vodka and tonic andtold the rest they’d receive just tonic water. In reality, the bartenders in thestudy didn’t pour a single drop of vodka; all the students got just plain tonic.The bar-like atmosphere the researchers fashioned looked very realistic, rightdown to the resealing of the vodka bottles that had been cleverly filled withflat tonic water. The bartenders rimmed glasses with limes dunked in vodka for amore realistic effect, before proceeding to mix and pour drinks as though theywere serving the real thing.The subjects became tipsy and acted drunk, with some even showing physical signsof intoxication. They didn’t get drunk because they drank alcohol; they gotdrunk because the environment, by associative memory, cued their brains andbodies to respond in the same old, familiar way.When the researchers eventually told the students the truth, many were amazedand insisted that they really did feel drunk at the time. They believed theywere drinking alcohol, and those beliefs translated into neurochemicals, whichaltered their states of being.In other words, their beliefs alone were sufficient to fire up a biochemicalchange in their bodies that was equal to being drunk. That’s because thestudents conditioned themselves enough times to associate alcohol with a changein their internal chemical states. As the subjects expected or anticipated thefuture change in their inner states based on their past associative memories ofdrinking, they were cued by the environment to physiologically change, just asdid Pavlov’s dogs.There’s a flip side, too, of course. The environment can also signal healing.Hospital patients in Pennsylvania who recovered from surgery in a room with aview of a stand of trees in a natural suburban setting needed less-potent painmedications and were released seven to nine days earlier than patients in roomsfacing a brown brick wall.11 [endnote.html#fnf-11] Our states of mind, createdfrom the environment, can most definitely contribute to healing our brains andour bodies.So, then, do you need a sugar pill or a saline injection or a sham procedure ora picture window—something or someone or someplace in your externalenvironment—to move into a new state of being? Or can you do it just by changinghow you think and feel? Can you simply believe in a new possibility of health,without relying on any external stimulus, and make the thought in your brain anew emotional experience to the degree that it changes your body and you becomegreater than the conditioning in your external environment?If so, what you’ve just read suggests that it would be a good idea to changeyour internal state every day—before you get up and face your same oldenvironment so that it won’t pull you, as it did the Parkinson’s patients, backto your old state of being. Remember Janis Schonfeld, from Chapter 1 [ch1.html],who made physical changes in her brain by thinking she was taking anantidepressant? Part of the reason the placebo worked so well for her was thattaking that inert pill was a daily reminder to change her state of being(because she associated taking the pill with her optimistic thoughts andfeelings about getting better—as do more than 80 percent of people who take anantidepressant placebo).If you could access a new state of being through meditation by combining a clearintention with getting in touch with that heightened state of emotion that wasmentioned earlier, and you got up jazzed and on fire about what you werecreating every day, you’d finally start coming out of your resting state. You’dthen be in a new state of being, with a different attitude, belief, andperception, no longer reacting to the same things in the same way, because nowyour environment would no longer control how you think and feel. You’d then bemaking new choices and demonstrating new behaviors, which would lead to newexperiences and new emotions. And so you’d then turn into a new and differentpersonality—a personality that doesn’t have the arthritic pain or theParkinson’s motor issues or the infertility or whatever other condition you wantto change.I want to take a moment to point out here that not all sickness and diseasestarts in our minds, of course. Certainly, babies are born with genetic defectsand conditions that clearly couldn’t have been triggered by their thoughts,feelings, attitudes, and beliefs. And trauma and accidents do indeed happen.Furthermore, exposure to environmental toxins can definitely wreak havoc in thehuman body. My point is not that when these things come up, we’ve somehow askedfor them—although it’s true that our physical bodies can be weakened by stresshormones and made more susceptible to disease when our immune systems shut down.My point is that no matter what the source of our ills, there’s a possibilitythat we can change our condition.Changing Your EnergySo now we can see that if we want to change our beliefs and create a placeboeffect to improve our health and our lives, we have to do the exact opposite ofwhat the Cambodian women did by default. By holding a clear and firm intentionand heightening our emotional energy, we have to create a new internalexperience in our minds and bodies that’s greater than the past externalexperience. In other words, when we decide to create a new belief, the amplitudeor energy of that choice must be high enough that it’s greater than thehardwired programs and emotional conditioning in the body.To see what happens when we do just this, take a look at Figure 7.3 on thefollowing page. Here, the energy of the choice in this new experience is greaterthan the energy of the trauma in the past experience (as we saw in Figure 7.2),which is why the peak in this graph is higher than the peak in the first graph.And as a result, the effects of this new experience override the residue of theneural programming and emotional conditioning from the past experience.This process, if we do it right, actually repatterns our brains and changes ourbiology; the new experience will reorganize the old programming, and in sodoing, it will remove the neurological evidence of that past experience. (Thinkof how a bigger wave breaking farther up on the beach erases any sign ofwhatever shell, seaweed, sea foam, or sand pattern was there before.) Strongemotional experiences create long-term memories. So this new internal experiencecreates new long-term memories that override our past long-term memories, thusthe choice becomes an experience that we never forget. There should be noevidence of our pasts in our brains and bodies any longer, and the new signalthen rewrites the neurological program and genetically changes the body.image [images/178.jpg]In order to change a belief or perception about yourself and your life, you haveto make a decision with such firm intention that the choice carries an amplitudeof energy that is greater than the hardwired programs in the brain and theemotional addiction in the body, and the body must respond to a new mind. Whenthe choice creates a new inner experience that becomes greater than the pastouter experience, it will rewrite the circuits in your brain and resignal yourbody emotionally. Since experiences create long-term memories, when the choicebecomes an experience that you never forget, you are changed. Biologically, thepast no longer exists. We could say that your body in that present moment is ina new future.Now look at Figure 7.3 again and notice how the slope of the line in the graphgoes all the way back down (whereas in Figure 7.2, it descended but stillremained higher than it was at the point where it started). That shows there’sno trace left of the past experience; it no longer exists in this new state ofbeing.In addition to reorganizing your neurocircuitry, this new signal also begins torewrite the body’s conditioning by breaking the emotional attachment to thepast. When that happens, in that second, the body is living fully in thepresent; it is no longer a prisoner of the past. That heightened energy is feltwithin the body and translated as a new emotion (which is just another way ofsaying “energy in motion,” or “e-motion”), whether that emotion is feelinginvincible, courageous, empowered, compassionate, inspired, or whatever. Andit’s energy that’s changing our biology, our neurocircuitry, and our geneticexpression—not chemistry.A similar process happens with the firewalkers, the glass chewers, and the snakehandlers. They get clear that they’re going to move into a different state ofmind and body. And when they hold that firm intention to make that shift, theenergy of that decision creates internal changes in their brains and bodies thatmake them immune to the external conditions in the environment for an extendedperiod of time. Their energy now is protecting them in a way that, in thatmoment, transcends their biology.As it happens, our neurochemistry isn’t the only thing that responds toheightened states of energy. The receptor sites on the outside of the body’scells happen to be a hundred times more sensitive to energy and frequency thanthey are to the physical chemical signals, like neuropeptides, that we know gainaccess to our cells’ DNA.12 [endnote.html#fnf-12] Research consistently revealsthat invisible forces of the electromagnetic spectrum influence every singleaspect of cellular biology and genetic regulation.13 [endnote.html#fnf-13] Cellreceptors are frequency-specific to incoming energy signals. The energies of theelectromagnetic spectrum include microwaves, radio waves, x-rays, extremelylow-frequency waves, sound harmonic frequencies, ultraviolet rays, and eveninfrared waves. Specific frequencies of electromagnetic energy can influence thebehavior of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis; alter protein shape and function;control gene regulation and expression; stimulate nerve-cell growth; andinfluence cell division and cell differentiation, as well as instruct specificcells to organize into tissues and organs. All of these cellular activitiesinfluenced by energy are part of the expression of life.And if that’s true, then it has to be true for some reason. Remember the 98.5percent of our DNA that scientists call “junk DNA” because it doesn’t seem toserve much of a useful purpose? Surely Mother Nature wouldn’t place all of thisencoded information in our cells, waiting to be read, without giving us theability to create some type of signal to unlock it; after all, nature doesn’twaste anything.Could it be that your own energy and consciousness is what creates the rightkind of signal outside of the cells to enable you to tap into that vast “partslist” of potentials? And if that was true, if you changed your energy the wayyou read about earlier in this chapter, could that help you access your trueability to authentically heal your body? When you change your energy, you changeyour state of being. And the rewiring in the brain and the new chemical emotionsin the body trigger epigenetic changes, and the result is that you become quiteliterally a new person. The person you were before is history; a part of thatperson simply vanished along with the neurocircuitry, chemical-emotionaladdictions, and genetic expression that supported your old state of being.image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Eight [toc.html#a12]The Quantum Mind [toc.html#a12]Reality can be a bit of a moving target—literally. We’re used to thinking ofreality as something fixed and certain, but as you’ll soon see in this chapter,the way we’ve always been taught to see it isn’t the way it really is. And ifyou’re going to learn how to be your own placebo by using your mind to affectmatter, it’s vital that you understand the true nature of reality, how mind andmatter are related, and how reality can shift—because if you don’t know how andwhy those shifts occur, you won’t be able to direct any outcomes according toyour intentions.Before we dive into the quantum universe, let’s take a look at where our ideasabout reality came from and where they’ve brought us so far. Thanks to RenéDescartes and Sir Isaac Newton, for centuries the study of the universe wasdivided into two categories: matter and mind. The study of matter (the materialworld) was declared the realm of science, because for the most part, the laws ofthe universe that govern the objective outer world could be calculated andtherefore predicted. But the inner realm of the mind was considered toounpredictable and complicated, so it was therefore left to the auspices ofreligion. Over time, matter and mind became separate entities, and dualism wasborn.Newtonian physics (also known as classical physics) deals with the mechanics ofhow objects function in space and time, including their interactions with eachother in the material, physical world. Because of Newton’s laws, we can measureand predict what path planets take around the sun, how quickly an appleaccelerates when it falls from a tree, and how long it takes to go from Seattleto New York by plane. Newtonian physics is about the predictable. It looks atthe universe as if it functioned like an enormous machine or a huge timepiece.But classical physics has its limitations when it comes to the study of energy,the actions of the immaterial world beyond space and time, and the behavior ofatoms (the building blocks of everything in the physical universe). That realmbelongs to quantum physics. And it turns out that this very tiny subatomic worldof electrons and photons doesn’t behave anything like the much larger world ofplanets, apples, and airplanes that we’re more familiar with.When quantum physicists began to look at the smaller and smaller aspects of anatom, like what makes up the nucleus, the closer they looked, the less distinctand clear the atom became, until eventually it just completely disappeared.Atoms, they tell us, appear to be 99.999999999999 percent empty space.1[endnote.html#fng-1] But that space isn’t really empty. It’s actually filledwith energy. More specifically, it’s made up of a vast array of energyfrequencies that form a kind of invisible, interconnected field of information.So if every atom is 99.999999999999 percent energy or information, that meansthat our known universe and every thing in it—no matter how solid that mattermay appear to us—is essentially just energy and information. That’s a scientificfact.Atoms do contain a smattering of matter, but when the quantum physicists triedto study it, they discovered something really strange: Subatomic matter in thequantum world doesn’t behave anything at all like the matter we’re used todealing with. Instead of adhering to the laws of Newtonian physics, it appearssomewhat chaotic and unpredictable, completely disregarding the boundaries oftime and space. In fact, on the subatomic quantum level, matter is a momentaryphenomenon. It’s here one moment, and then it disappears. It exists only as atendency, a probability, or a possibility. In the quantum, there are no absolutephysical things.That wasn’t the only strange discovery that scientists made about the quantumuniverse. They also found that when they observed particles of subatomic matter,they could affect or change their behavior. The reason they’re here and gone(and then here and gone again all the time) is that all of these particlesactually exist simultaneously in an infinite array of possibilities orprobabilities within the invisible and infinite quantum field of energy. It’sonly when an observer focuses attention on any one location of any one electronthat the electron actually appears in that place. Look away, and the subatomicmatter disappears back into energy.So according to this “observer effect,” physical matter can’t exist or manifestuntil we observe it—until we notice it and give it our attention. And when we’reno longer paying attention to it, it vanishes, going back from whence it came.So matter is constantly transforming, oscillating between manifesting intomatter and disappearing into energy (about 7.8 times per second, as a matter offact). And so because the human mind (as the observer) is then intimatelyconnected to the behavior and appearance of matter, you could say that mind overmatter is a quantum reality. Another way to look at it is this: In the tinyworld of the quantum, the subjective mind has an effect on objective reality.Your mind can become matter; that is, you can make your mind matter.Since subatomic matter makes up everything we can see and touch and experiencein our macro world, then in a sense we—along with everything in our world—arealso doing this disappearing and reappearing act all the time. And so ifsubatomic particles exist in an infinite number of possible placessimultaneously, then in some way, so do we. And just as these particles go fromexisting everywhere simultaneously (wave, or energy) to existing precisely wherethe observer looks for them at the moment the observer is paying attention(particle, or matter), we’re also potentially capable of collapsing an infinitenumber of potential realities into physical existence.In other words, if you can imagine a particular future event that you want toexperience in your life, that reality already exists as a possibility somewherein the quantum field—beyond this space and time—just waiting for you to observeit. If your mind (through your thoughts and feelings) can affect when and wherean electron appears out of nowhere, then theoretically, you should be able toinfluence the appearance of any number of possibilities that you can imagine.From a quantum perspective, if you observed yourself in a particular new futurethat was different from your past, expected that reality to occur, and thenemotionally embraced the outcome, you’d be—for a moment—living in that futurereality, and you’d be conditioning your body to believe it was in that future inthe present moment. So the quantum model, which states that all possibilitiesexist in this moment, gives us permission to choose a new future and observe itinto reality. And because the entire universe is made of atoms, with more than99 percent of an atom being energy or possibility, that means that there’s a lotof potentials out there that you and I might be missing.However, this also means that you create by default as well. If you, as thequantum observer, look at your life from the same level of mind every day, thenaccording to the quantum model of reality, you’re causing infinite possibilitiesto collapse into the same patterns of information day in and day out. Thosepatterns, which you call your life, never change, so they never allow you toeffect change.So the mental rehearsal I talked about earlier is certainly not idle daydreamingor wishful thinking. It is, in a very real sense, the way you can intentionallymanifest your desired reality, including a life without pain or disease. Byfocusing more on what you do want and less on what you don’t want, you can callinto existence whatever you desire and simultaneously “fade away” what you don’twant by no longer giving it your attention. Where you place your attention iswhere you place your energy. Once you fix your attention or your awareness oryour mind on possibility, you place your energy there as well. As a result,you’re affecting matter with your attention or observation. The placebo effectis not fantasy, then; it’s quantum reality.Energy on the Quantum LevelAll atoms in the elemental world emit various electromagnetic energies. Forexample, an atom can give off invisible fields of energy at differentfrequencies that include x-rays, gamma rays, ultraviolet rays, and infraredrays, as well as visible light rays. And just as invisible radio waves carry afrequency with specific information encoded into it (whether it’s 98.6 or 107.5hertz), each different frequency likewise carries specific diverse information,as shown in Figure 8.1. For example, x-rays carry very different informationthan infrared rays do, because they are different frequencies. All of thesefields are different energy patterns that are always giving off information atthe atomic level.image [images/185.jpg]This chart shows two different frequencies that each carry different informationand therefore have different qualities. X-rays behave differently from radiowaves and thus have different inherent characteristics.Think of atoms as vibrating fields of energy or small vortices that areconstantly spinning. To better understand how that works, let’s use the analogyof a fan. Just like a circular fan creates wind (a vortex of air) when it’sturned on, each atom, as it spins, radiates a field of energy in a similarfashion. And just like a fan can spin at different speeds and so create strongeror weaker wind, atoms also vibrate at different frequencies that create strongeror weaker fields. The faster the atom vibrates, the greater the energy andfrequency it emits. The slower the speed of the atom’s vibration or vortex, theless energy it creates.The slower a fan’s blades spin, the less wind (or energy) is created and theeasier it is to see the blades as material objects in physical reality. On theother hand, the faster the blades spin, the more energy is created and the lessyou see of the physical blades; the blades appear to be immaterial. Where thefan blades can potentially appear (like the subatomic particles the quantumscientists were trying to observe that kept popping in and out of view) dependson your observation—where and how you look for them. And so it is with atoms.Let’s look at this in a little more depth.In quantum physics, matter is defined as a solid particle, and the immaterialenergetic field of information can be defined as the wave. When we study thephysical properties of atoms, like mass, atoms look like physical matter. Theslower the frequency that an atom is vibrating, the more time it spends inphysical reality and the more it appears as a particle that we can see as solidmatter. The reason physical matter appears solid to us, even though it’s mostlyenergy, is that all of the atoms are vibrating at the same speed we are.But atoms also display many properties of energy or waves (including light,wavelengths, and frequency). The faster an atom vibrates and the more energy itgenerates, the less time it spends in physical reality; it’s appearing anddisappearing too fast for us to see it, because it’s vibrating at a much fasterspeed than we are. But even though we can’t see the energy itself, we cansometimes see physical evidence of certain frequencies of energy, because theforce field of atoms can create physical properties, such as the way infraredwaves heat things up.If you compare Figure 8.2A to Figure 8.2B, you can see how slower frequenciesspend more time in the material world and thus appear as matter.image [images/187.jpg]image [images/187a.jpg]When energy vibrates slower, particles appear in physical reality for longerperiods of time and thus appear as solid matter. Figure 8.2A shows how mattermanifests from a slower frequency with a longer wavelength. Figure 8.2B depictsparticles spending less time in physical reality, therefore they are more energyand less matter. That’s because they have shorter wavelengths, faster frequency,and a faster vibration.So the physical universe may look as if it’s made up of only material matter,but in truth, it shares a field of information (the quantum field) that unifiesmatter and energy so intimately that it’s impossible to consider them asseparate entities. That’s because all particles are connected in an immaterialinvisible field of information beyond space and time—and that field is made ofconsciousness (thought) and energy (frequency, the speed at which thingsvibrate).Because each atom has its own specific field of energy or energy signature, whenatoms assemble collectively to form molecules, they share their fields ofinformation and then radiate their own unique combined energy patterns. Ifeverything material in the universe radiates a specific unique energy signaturebecause everything is made of atoms, then you and I radiate our own specificenergy signatures as well. You and I are always broadcasting information aselectromagnetic energy—based on our states of being.So when you change your energy to alter a belief or perception about yourself oryour life, you’re actually increasing the frequency of the atoms and moleculesof your physical body so that you’re amplifying your energy field (as shown inFigure 8.3). You’re turning up the speed on the atomic fans that make up yourbody. As you embrace a heightened, emotional creative state like inspiration,empowerment, gratitude, or invincibility, you’re causing your atoms to spinfaster, just like the fan blades, and to broadcast a stronger energy fieldaround your body, which affects your physical matter.So the physical particles that make up your body are now responding to anelevated energy. You’re becoming more energy and less matter. You’re now morewave and less particle. Using your consciousness, you’re creating more energy sothat matter can be lifted to a new frequency, and your body responds to a newmind.image [images/189.jpg]When you change your energy, you lift matter to a new mind, and your bodyvibrates at a faster frequency. You become more energy and less matter—more waveand less particle. The more elevated the emotion or the higher the creativestate of mind, the more energy you have to rewrite the programs in the body.Your body then responds to a new mind.Receiving the Right Energetic SignalSo how does matter become lifted to a new mind? Think of the preacher who movesinto a state of religious ecstasy and drinks strychnine, with no biologicaleffects. How did he overcome that chemistry that would normally poison theaverage person? It was his level of energy that transcended the effects ofmatter. He made a decision with such firm intention that his choice carried anamplitude of energy that transcended the laws of the environment, the effects onthe body, and linear time. In that moment, he was more energy and less matter,and as a result, it was a new energy that rewrote the circuitry in his brain,the chemistry in his body, and his genetic expression. In that present moment,he wasn’t his identity that was connected to his familiar environment, nor washe his physical body, nor was he living in linear time. His elevatedconsciousness and energy were the epiphenomenon of matter. In other words, it’sboth information and frequency that give rise to the blueprints of matter. Andwhen we’re demonstrating an elevated level of awareness and energy, it’s theseelements that influence matter—because matter is created from a lowering offrequency and information.It’s entirely possible that the preacher’s cell-receptor sites weren’tselectively open for the strychnine; the cells’ doors were closed to poison andso were suspended from its effects. By being moved by the spirit—that is, movedby energy—he instantly upregulated the cells in his body for immunity anddownregulated the cells in his body for poison. The same thing is at work withthe firewalkers; once they change their state of being, their cell receptors areno longer open to the effects of heat. This is also what allowed the teenagegirls to lift the 3,000-pound tractor to free their father, as you read about inChapter 1 [ch1.html]. When they saw their father trapped and almost certain todie, their heightened state of energy turned off the cell receptors thatnormally would tell their bodies that the tractor was too heavy to lift andturned on the muscle-cell receptors to bear a greater load so that when theytried, their muscles responded and they were able to free their dad. It wasn’tmatter (body) that was moving matter (tractor); it was energy that wasinfluencing matter.You’d have to agree with me that your body is made up of a vast array of atomsand molecules and that these atoms and molecules form chemicals. Those chemicalsorganize into cells, which form tissues that further organize into organs, whichcreate various systems within your body. For example, a muscle cell is made ofdifferent chemicals (proteins, ions, cytokines, growth factors), which are madeof the different interactions of molecules, which are made of various atomicbonds; those atoms share an invisible field of information to form molecules.The chemicals that make up a cell also share a field of information. It’s thatinvisible field of information that orchestrates the hundreds of thousands offunctions of the cell at any given second. Scientists are beginning to realizethat a field of information exists that’s responsible for myriad cellularfunctions existing beyond the boundaries of matter.It’s this invisible field of consciousness that orchestrates all of thefunctions of the cells, tissues, organs, and systems of the body. How do certainchemicals and molecules of your cells know what to do and interact with suchprecision? There’s an energetic field surrounding the cell that’s the summationof energy from atoms, molecules, and chemicals working together in balance thatgives birth to matter, and it’s that vital field of information that matterdraws from.For instance, the muscle cells in the previous example can further organize andspecialize into tissues called “muscle tissue.” Let’s say that the particulartype of muscle tissue in this example is called “cardiac muscle.” Cardiac muscletissue forms an organ called the “heart.” The tissues, which are made of cells,share a field of information that allows the heart to function in a coherentmanner. The heart is part of the cardiovascular system of the entire body. As itshares this field of information, it organizes matter to function in a harmonic,holistic way. So the field that’s created that gives birth to matter is whatcontrols matter. The greater the field, the faster the atoms vibrate—or thefaster your subatomic fan blades spin.The Newtonian model of biology is based on linear events in which chemicalreactions occur in a sequence of steps. But that’s not actually how biologyworks; you can no longer explain something even as simple as how a cut healswithout the understanding of the interconnected coherent information pathwaysyou just read about. Cells share an intercommunication of information in anonlinear way. The universe and all the biological systems within it share anintegration of independent, entangled energy fields that, in turn, shareinformation beyond space and time on a moment-to-moment basis.Research confirms that most interactions between cells happen faster than thespeed of light2 [endnote.html#fng-2]—and since the limit of this physicalreality is the speed of light, that means that cells must communicate via thequantum field. The interactions between atoms and molecules form anintercommunication that unifies the physical, material world and the energyfields that make up the whole. In the quantum, the linear, predictablecharacteristics of the Newtonian world do not exist. Things interact in aholistic, cooperative manner.So according to the quantum model of reality, we could say that all disease is alowering of frequency. Think about stress hormones. When your nervous system isunder the control of fight-or-flight mode, the chemicals of survival cause youto be more matter and less energy. You become a materialist, because you’redefining reality with your senses; you overuse the vital energy surrounding thecell by mobilizing it for an emergency; and all of your attention goes towardthe outer world of the environment, the body, and time. If you keep the stressresponse turned on for extended periods of time, the long-term effects keepslowing down the frequency of the body such that it becomes more and moreparticle and less and less wave. That means that there’s less consciousness,energy, and information available for atoms, molecules, and chemicals to share.As a result, you become matter trying futilely to change matter—you are a bodytrying without success to change a body.All of the individual subatomic fans making up your body start spinning not onlyslower, but also out of rhythm with one another. This creates incoherence amongthe body’s atoms and molecules, which causes a weakened signal of communicationsuch that the body begins to break down. The more your body is matter and theless it is energy, the more you’re at the mercy of the second law ofthermodynamics—the law of entropy—where material things in the universe tend tomove toward disorder and breakdown.Think what would happen if you had hundreds of fans in one enormous room, allworking together and spinning in harmony, humming away in unison. That coherenthumming would be like music to your ears, because it would be rhythmic andconsistent. That’s what it’s like in our bodies when the signals between ouratoms, molecules, and cells are strong and coherent.Now imagine how different it would be if there weren’t enough electricity(energy) getting to each of the fans, resulting in their spinning at differentspeeds or frequencies. The room would then be filled with a cacophony ofincoherent clanking, wobbling, stopping, and starting. That’s what it’s likewhen the signals between our bodies’ atoms, molecules, and cells are weaker andincoherent.When you change your energy because you made a decision with firm intention, youincrease the frequency of your atomic structure and create a more intentional,coherent electromagnetic signature (as depicted in Figure 8.4). You’re nowaffecting the physical matter of your body. By increasing your energy, youincrease the electricity flowing to your atomic fans. The elevated frequencybegins to entrain or to organize the cells of your body to become less particle(matter) and more wave (energy). Or to put it another way, all of your matterhas more energy—or more information. Think of coherence as rhythm ororderliness, and incoherence as the lack of rhythm, lack of orderliness, or lackof synchrony.image [images/194.jpg]From a quantum perspective, a higher, more coherent frequency is called health,and a slower, more incoherent frequency is called disease. All disease is alowering of frequency, as well as the expression of incoherent information.Imagine a group of a hundred drummers with no rhythm banging on drums all at thesame time. That’s incoherence. Now imagine that a group of five professionaldrummers shows up among the mob of wannabe drummers, spreads out to differentlocations in the crowd, and starts to create a very rhythmic beat. In time, thefive would entrain the entire hundred other drummers into perfect rhythm,orderliness, and synchrony.That’s exactly what happens when your body responds to a new mind, when the hairon the back of your neck stands up because you feel more like energy and lesslike matter. In that moment, you’re lifting matter to a new mind. You’reentraining the disease that exists as a lowering of frequency to an elevatedfrequency. At the same time, you’re also causing the incoherent information thatexisted among the atoms and molecules, chemicals and cells, tissues and organs,and systems of the body to instead function from a field of more organizedinformation.It’s like hearing static on your radio and then tuning in to a clear signalwhere, all of a sudden, the static disappears and you can hear the music. Yourbrain and nervous system do the same by tuning in to higher, more coherentfrequencies. Once that occurs, you’re no longer subject to the law of entropy.You experience reverse entropy, and the coherent signature of the energy fieldaround your body causes you to be immune to the typical laws of physicalreality. Now all of the atomic fans are spinning at a faster coherent frequency,and the physical molecules, chemicals, and cells that make up your body arereceiving new information so that your energy is having a positive effect onyour body.Figures 8.5A, 8.5B, and 8.5C on the following page illustrate how a higher, morecoherent frequency of energy entrains a slower, more incoherent frequency ofmatter, lifting matter to a new mind.The more organized and coherent your energy, the more you entrain matter at anorganized frequency, and the faster that frequency, the better and the moreprofound the electromagnetic signal the cell receives. (Remember, as you learnedin the previous chapter, cells are a hundred times more sensitive toelectromagnetic signals—energy—than to chemical signals, and it’s these signalsthat change DNA expression.) The more incoherent and unsynchronized your energyis, on the other hand, the less able your cells are to communicate with oneanother. You’ll learn the science of how to create coherence very shortly.image [images/196.jpg]image [images/196a.jpg]image [images/196b.jpg]When higher, more coherent energy interacts with slower, more incoherent energy,it begins to entrain matter to a more organized state.Beyond the Quantum DoorwaySince the quantum field is an invisible field of information, is frequencybeyond space and time that all things material come from, and is made ofconsciousness and energy, then everything physical in the universe is unifiedwithin and connected to this field. And since all things material are made ofatoms, which are connected beyond space and time, then you and I, along with allthings in the universe, are connected by this field of intelligence—personal anduniversal, both within us and all around us—that gives life, information,energy, and consciousness to all things.Call it what you will, but this is the universal intelligence that’s giving youlife right now. It organizes and orchestrates the hundreds of thousands of notesin the harmonious symphony that is your physiology—those things that are part ofyour autonomic nervous system. This intelligence keeps your heart beating morethan 101,000 times a day to pump more than two gallons of blood per minute,traveling more than 60,000 miles in each 24-hour period. As you finish readingthis sentence, your body will have made 25 trillion cells. And each of the 70trillion cells that make up your body execute somewhere between 100,000 to 6trillion functions per second. You’ll inhale 2 million liters of oxygen today,and each time you inhale, that oxygen will be distributed to every cell in yourbody within seconds.Do you consciously keep track of all that? Or does something that has a mind somuch greater than your mind, and a will so much greater than your will, do itfor you? That’s love! In fact, that intelligence loves you so much that it lovesyou into life. It’s the same universal mind that animates every aspect of thematerial universe. This invisible field of intelligence exists beyond space andtime, and it’s where all things material come from.It causes supernovas to be born in distant galaxies and roses to bloom inVersailles. It keeps the planets revolving around our sun and the tides risingand falling at Malibu. Because it exists in all places and at all times, andit’s both within you and all around you, this intelligence must be both personaland universal. So there’s a subjective, freewill consciousness (the individualawareness) called “you,” and there’s an objective consciousness (the universalawareness) that’s responsible for all life.If you were to close your eyes and take your attention off your body and all ofthe people, things, and events arising at different times and places in yourexternal environment, letting go of time for a moment, you, as the quantumobserver, would be removing your energy from your familiar life and investingyour awareness into the unknown field of possibilities. Since where you placeyour attention is where you place your energy, then if you keep placing yourawareness on your known life, your energy is invested in that familiar life. Butif you were to invest your energy in the unknown field of possibilities beyondspace and time, and you instead became a consciousness (a thought in quantumpotential), you’d be drawing a new experience to yourself. As you enter ameditative state, your subjective, freewill consciousness would merge with theobjective, universal consciousness, and you’d be planting a seed in possibility.The self-organizing autonomic nervous system is your connection to that innateintelligence I mentioned that performs all of those automatic functions for you.It’s certainly not your thinking neocortex that’s responsible for the functionsmentioned previously. Instead, it’s the lower brain centers below the neocortexthat subconsciously run the show. This loving intelligence is what you mergewith in meditation when you lay down the ego and go from selfish to selfless,when you become pure consciousness—no longer a body in the environment or inlinear time but, instead, no body, no one, no thing, in no place and no time.That’s when you become simply an awareness in an infinite field of possibility.You’re in the unknown. And from the unknown, all things are created. You’re inthe quantum field. And you and I already have all the biological machinery weneed to accomplish this feat of becoming pure consciousness.image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Nine [toc.html#a13]Three Stories of Personal Transformation [toc.html#a13]In this chapter you’ll meet a few folks who put the energy of theirconsciousness into the immaterial world beyond the senses and repeatedlyembraced a possibility until it materialized into their lives.Laurie’s StoryAt age 19, Laurie was diagnosed with a rare degenerative bone disease, calledpolyostotic fibrous dysplasia. In this debilitating condition, the body replacesnormal bone with a cheaper, fibrous tissue, and the skeleton’s supportiveprotein scaffolding becomes uncharacteristically thin and irregular. Theatypical growth process associated with the syndrome causes bones to swell,weaken, and then fracture. Fibrous dysplasia can occur in any part of theskeleton, and in Laurie’s body, it manifested in her right femur, right hipsocket, right tibia, and some of the bones of her right foot. Her doctors toldher the disease had no cure.Fibrous dysplasia is a genetic condition that usually doesn’t manifest untiladolescence. In Laurie’s case, she spent a whole year limping painfully aroundher college campus with what turned out to be a femoral fracture, before anysign of the disease surfaced. She was shocked to hear she’d broken a bone,because she hadn’t suffered any trauma. Other than one foot being anatomicallylarger than the other, Laurie hadn’t seen any evidence that anything was wrongwith her until that point. She’d lived a relatively active youth filled withactivities like running, dancing, and playing tennis. At the time she beganlimping, she’d even begun training as a competitive bodybuilder.After the diagnosis, Laurie’s life changed overnight. Her orthopedic surgeonwarned her that she was fragile and extremely vulnerable. He insisted that shewalk only with crutches until he could schedule her for surgery: first a bonegraft, followed by the insertion of a Russell-Taylor femoral nail down the boneshaft. After hearing that news, both Laurie and her mother spent an hour cryingin the hospital cafeteria. It was like some sort of nightmare; Laurie’s life, asshe knew it, seemed to be suddenly over.Laurie’s perception of her limitations—both real and imagined—began to dominateher life. To avoid additional fractures, she followed the surgeon’s orders anddutifully used the crutches. She had to quit the marketing internship she’drecently begun with a major Manhattan product manufacturer and, instead, beganfilling her days with medical appointments. Her father insisted she see as manyorthopedic specialists as possible, so her weeping mother drove Laurie fromdoctor’s office to doctor’s office over the next several weeks.Each time she saw a new doctor, Laurie would patiently wait for a differentmedical opinion, only to receive the same bad news again. In just a few months,ten surgeons had weighed in on her condition. The last physician she saw didhave a different opinion: He told Laurie that the surgery the other doctors hadrecommended absolutely wouldn’t help her, because inserting the nail wouldstrengthen the diseased bone only in the weakest location and would actuallycause more fractures in the next most vulnerable area above or below the nail.He advised Laurie to forget about surgery and continue using crutches or awheelchair—or simply become sedentary for the rest of her life.From then on, Laurie remained still most of the time for fear she might break abone. She felt powerless, small, and fragile, and she was filled with anxietyand self-pity. She did return to college a month later, but stayed largelycooped up in an apartment that she shared with five other women. She cultivatedan impressive ability to cloak a severe and mounting clinical depression.Fearing Her FatherLaurie’s father had been a violent man for as long as she could remember. Evenonce his children were grown, each member of the family had to be prepared forthe wrath of this man’s quick-moving fists at the most unexpected of moments.Everyone was constantly in a state of vigilance, wondering when his temper wouldflare next. Although Laurie certainly didn’t know it at the time, her father’sbehavior was intrinsically connected to her condition.Newborns spend the vast majority of their days in the delta brain-wave state.During the first 12 years, children gradually progress to a theta state and thento an alpha state, before they get to the beta state they’ll spend most of theiradulthood in. As you read earlier, theta and alpha are highly suggestiblebrain-wave states. Young children don’t yet have an analytical mind to edit orto make sense of what happens to them, so all of the information they absorbfrom their experiences is encoded directly into their subconscious minds.Because of their increased suggestibility, the moment they feel emotionallyaltered from some experience, they pay attention to whoever or whatever causedit and so are conditioned to form associative memories connecting that cause tothe emotion of the experience itself. If it’s a parent, then over time, childrenwill attach to that caregiver and think that the emotions they feel from theexperience are normal, because they don’t yet have the ability to analyze thesituation. This is how early-childhood experiences become subconscious states ofbeing.Although Laurie didn’t know this when her condition was diagnosed, theemotionally charged events she experienced growing up with her father had beenbranded into her implicit memory system beyond her conscious mind, programmingher biology. Her reaction to her father’s anger—feeling weak, powerless,vulnerable, stressed, and fearful every single day—then became part of herautonomic nervous system so that her body chemically memorized these emotionsand the environment signaled the genes associated with her disorder to turn on.Because that response was autonomic, she wouldn’t be able to change it as longas she stayed trapped in her emotional body. She could only analyze her state ofbeing equal to the emotions of her past, even though the answers she neededexisted beyond those emotions.Once Laurie received the fibrous dysplasia diagnosis, her mother immediatelyproclaimed to the entire family that Laurie had been officially pronounced“fragile” by modern medicine—so she was safe from her father’s physicalviolence. Although he continued to emotionally and verbally abuse Laurie (rightup until his death 15 years later), her disease, ironically, protected her fromfurther physical abuse.Cementing Her Identity in DiseaseThis perverse sense of safety that Laurie created became a vehicle of survivalfor her. As a result, she began to benefit from special treatment (which shealmost always needed). Whether getting a seat on the bus or subway when therewas standing room only, getting her friends to wait in line for events while shesat on a nearby bench, or getting a seat quickly in a crowded restaurant, Lauriefound that her disease began to work for her. She started relying heavily on herailment to get what she wanted. She was now able to manage better in a worldthat she’d never before viewed as safe. The emotional benefit of manipulatingher reality to get what she wanted in this way became very convenient, andLaurie received far more than she really needed to take stress off her body toprevent injury. Before long, her disease became her identity.Laurie next developed a late-adolescent rebellion against the life that shethought had been thrust upon her by her doctors, her parents, and fate. By thenext semester after her diagnosis, she went into a solid state of denial abouther disease. She decided to become the first “gimpy” bodybuilder, returning tothe sport with complete devotion. Blindly obsessive, while white-knuckling itand forcing a positive attitude solely with her conscious mind, Laurie foundcreative ways to bear weight that wouldn’t twist her limbs.She thought that by trying to push through the pain, she’d becomehealthier—although in truth, her efforts backfired, because she felt awful mostof the time and her pain worsened. As sometimes happens with polyostotic fibrousdysplasia patients, Laurie also developed scoliosis and suffered from severeback pain daily. By the time she was in her 20s, she began to develop arthritisin her spine and elsewhere.After she graduated from college, despite shuttling herself between a new houseand a new job, Laurie became very sedentary and felt even more removed fromlife. Her fear, anxiety, and depression remained. She envied most of her peersand lost friendships and romantic interests because she lived more like herelderly parents than like a young adult.By her late 20s, Laurie used a cane all the time to get around, even when shewasn’t nursing one of the 12 serious fractures she’d eventually endure. As ifthose issues weren’t enough, she also experienced dangerous microfractures. Herbones were so weak that bigger stress fractures would appear beneath themicroscopic fissures and connect to other areas of weakened bone to form evenbigger fractures that could be seen on an x-ray.By age 30, Laurie had more back problems than her 72-year-old father, and sheessentially became old before her time. She rested in bed for days and missed somany weeks of work that she was forced to quit jobs. She put graduate school onhold, because the school that accepted her didn’t have a working elevator. Shehad to forgo parties, museum outings, shopping, traveling, concerts, and otheractivities that would have involved a lot of standing or walking. She was caughtin the thinking-and-feeling loop I talked about earlier: thinking that she waslimited and fragile on the inside, while her body manifested limitedness andfragility on the outside. The more she felt vulnerable and weak, the morevulnerable and weak she became—while continuing to experience fractures thatreinforced her belief that she was frail, and further reaffirming her identityand validating her state of being.She adjusted her diet and took various vitamins and supplements in addition tobone-strengthening drugs, but nothing seemed to stop the fractures. She couldfracture a bone from just walking up a flight of stairs or even stepping off acurb. It was like waiting for the next nightmare in a series.Ironically, when Laurie wasn’t using crutches or limping, she looked perfectlyhealthy. Most people assumed that her cane was some sort of eccentric accessory,and many didn’t believe Laurie really had a debilitating condition, which madeit difficult and frustrating at times to receive the special treatment she oftenneeded. Trying to convince people that she really had a disease furthersolidified her identity as a sick person, set her intention to prove she washandicapped, and anchored her belief about her disabled status. While the restof the world seemed to work very hard to hide their weaknesses andvulnerabilities, Laurie found that she was constantly announcing hers.She spent a lot of energy trying to control as much as possible in herenvironment. She paid careful attention to everything she ate and drank,measuring everything she consumed. Every walk around her neighborhood wascalculated. She even weighed how much she could carry home from the supermarket:ten pounds, which was also the limit of the weight she could gain before herbones would worsen.It was exhausting, but it was all Laurie knew to do. Her range of options gotnarrower and narrower as she kept limiting the scope of things that she could dophysically in an attempt to keep from fracturing. As her lifestyle becamenarrower, her mind became narrower along with it. Laurie’s fears increased, herdepression worsened, and eventually, she tried to work again but couldn’t evenhold down a job.This same woman who’d once been a runner, dancer, and competitive bodybuilderwas now limited to doing only yoga for fitness, and by her late 30s, even hathayoga had come to be too much for her. For years, her exercise was limited tositting in a chair and doing vigorous breathing (although in her early 40s, herdoctor finally allowed her to take up lap swimming).She did make some attempts at healing through therapists, holistic doctors,energy healers, sound healers, and homeopaths—always seeking solutions outsideof herself. A few times, she’d feel better after an energy healing and gostraight to the orthopedist and demand new x-rays—only to be deflated when theresults came back unchanged. She thought, Maybe this is as good as it’s evergoing to get. She awoke overwhelmed each morning, overcome with a feeling ofdread, convinced she couldn’t handle whatever the world had in store for her.Laurie Learns What’s PossibleLaurie and I met in 2009, after she had seen What the Bleep Do We Know!? andbecome transfixed by the concept that a person could possibly create a totallynew life. I happened to meet her while eating dinner before a workshop I wasteaching at a retreat center near New York. We talked about the courses I gaveon personal change, and she immediately registered for my next class thatAugust.When Laurie came to her first event, she heard that it was absolutely possibleto change your brain, your thoughts, your body, your emotional state, and yourgenetic expression. During the workshop, I talked about physical change, butLaurie’s beliefs about her disease and her body were tenacious and her emotionswere stuck quite firmly in her past. She had absolutely no intention of healingher body, mostly because she didn’t really believe it was even possible. Shecame because she just wanted to feel better on the inside.Laurie immediately applied the principles I taught as best she could, eventhough she couldn’t seem to feel different by choice. The very first thing shedid, almost immediately after that first weekend course, was to stop sharing herdiagnosis with others. Even though she couldn’t control her emotions, shefigured that she still had control over what she said out loud. So unless sheneeded to ask for a chair at a party or explain to a date why she couldn’t takea walk with him, she stopped acknowledging her condition altogether. Lauriechose to focus on where she was headed in her future: toward a happy inner self,a deep connection to some unknown divine source, a wonderful job that sheexcelled at, a life partner, and close and healthy relationships with friendsand relatives.Laurie next concentrated on changing a few simple behaviors. She watched herthoughts and words, and reminded herself repeatedly to stop her old, repetitive,destructive patterns. She kept doing the meditations and taking my courses. Inorder to assign meaning to what she was doing, she reread her class notesreligiously and kept in touch with as many fellow students as she could. Intime, some small but perceptible percentage of the day, Laurie felt better,taller, abler, and stronger. She’d say “Change” to herself 20 times a day,whenever she noticed her mind drifting to her past. Although negative thoughtssneaked through a hundred times a day, little by little, Laurie created a fewnew thoughts, wrote them down, and attempted to believe them deeply.Laurie worked hard at it, but it took almost two years before she could reallyfeel those new thoughts. Instead of getting frustrated during that waitingperiod, Laurie reminded herself that it had taken quite a long time to createthe disease from her emotional state, so it might take some time to uncreate it.She also reminded herself that she’d have to go through a biological,neurological, chemical, and genetic death of the old self before the new selfemerged.The circumstances in her external environment got worse before they got better.A flood trashed Laurie’s home, and other situations in her apartment buildingcreated some new health problems. Laurie told me that every time she’d sit downto do her meditation and rehearse her ideal life, she felt as if she weretelling herself a lie—and afterward, opening her eyes to her currentcircumstances felt like a slap in the face. I encouraged her to stop definingreality with her senses and to keep crossing the river of change.Laurie kept limping in to the workshops, grumpy at times and grateful at others,and she kept at the work. She also assembled as many local fellow students asshe could to meditate together. Hardly any situations in Laurie’s life werepleasing, so she thought, What the hell, I may as well have one hour a daybehind my own eyelids where reality looks different, where I have a pain-freebody, a safe and quiet home, and a full and loving relationship with the outsideworld and with my friends and family.In early 2012, during one of my progressive workshops, Laurie had a significantdeepening in her meditation experience. She was literally and figurativelyrocked to her core. Physically, it was like a disturbance and then a release.Her body shook, her face contorted, and her arms flew up as she tried her bestto stay rooted to her chair. Emotionally, it was inexplicable joy. She cried,she laughed, and sounds came out of her mouth that she couldn’t explain. All ofthe fear and control that she’d previously used to hold herself together wasfinally loosening. For the first time, she felt a divine presence and knew shewas no longer alone.Laurie told me, “I sensed something, someone, some divine presence, and thisconsciousness wasn’t ignorant to my existence and unconcerned with my welfare,as I apparently previously believed. This consciousness has actually been payingattention. Realizing that was an overwhelming change for me.” All the energyshe’d been putting into controlling her physical movements and her life ingeneral finally began to relax and unwind, and the energy she’d been using tomaintain that control started to free up.At the next event, I noticed that Laurie was walking without a cane or any limp.She was happy, smiling, and laughing to herself, instead of irritated, frowning,and wincing in pain. She was transmuting fear into courage, frustration intopatience, pain into joy, and weakness into strength. She was beginning tochange—on the inside and the outside. Free from the addiction of those limitingemotions, her body was now living less in the past as she moved toward a newfuture.In early spring of 2012, Laurie’s orthopedist told her during a regular checkupthat about two-thirds of the length of a fracture she’d had in her femur sinceshe was 19 (a fracture that had shown up on every one of the hundred or sox-rays she’d had so far) had vanished. He had no explanation to offer but,instead, suggested she begin riding a stationary bicycle at the gym for tenminutes, twice a week. The message was music to Laurie’s ears, and off she went.Success and SetbacksAll of Laurie’s work in crossing the river of change was now starting to payoff. She was finally getting feedback that let her know she was making some typeof physical progress. Each day, as Laurie got beyond her body, her environment,and time, she was also getting beyond the personality that was connected to herpresent and past external reality, beyond her emotionally addicted andhabituated body, and beyond the predictable future that she’d always expected,based on her memory of the past. All of her effort to supersede her analyticalmind, change her brain waves to those of a more suggestible state, find thepresent moment, and venture into the programming system where she wasemotionally altered earlier in her life was finally changing her.Laurie started to really believe that her mind was healing her body by thoughtalone. And the old fracture that was connected to the old self was healing,because she was literally becoming someone else. She was no longer firing andwiring the circuits in her brain that were connected to the old personality,because she was no longer thinking and acting in the same ways. She stoppedconditioning her body to the same mind by reliving her past with the sameemotions. She was “unmemorizing” being her old self and remembering being a newself—that is, firing and wiring new thoughts and actions in her brain bychanging her mind and emotionally teaching her body what her future self wouldfeel like.Laurie was signaling new genes in new ways during her daily meditation by simplychanging her state of being. Those genes were making new proteins that werehealing the proteins responsible for the fractures related to her “dis-ease.”From what she learned in the workshops, she reasoned that her bone cells neededto get the right signal from her mind in order to turn off the gene of fibrousdysplasia and turn on the gene for the production of a normal bone matrix.Laurie explained:I knew that over the years, all of those fractures had manifested structurallyfrom the unhealthy protein expression in my bone cells, because I had beenliving by the survival emotions of fear, victimization, and pain—and I feltweak. I was powerful enough to manifest weakness perfectly in my body. I hadprogrammed the genes to stay on, because I’d memorized those emotionssubconsciously in my body. And my body, as my mind, was always living in thepast. So I figured, if bones are made of collagen—which is a protein—and Iwanted my bone cells to make some healthy collagen, I’d have to enter myautonomic nervous system, get beyond my analytical mind, enter into thesubconscious mind, repeatedly reprogram my body with new information, and allowit to receive new orders every day. When I received the good news, I felt like Iwas halfway across the river of change.Laurie kept her meditations going and continued to take my workshops. Shecontinued to have times of physical pain, but the frequency, intensity, andduration decreased considerably. She changed as many things as she possiblycould. She changed gyms just for a different environment. She put her deodoranton the right side first instead of the left. She folded her arms left over rightinstead of the more natural right over left, whenever she could remember to doso. She sat in a different chair in her apartment. She slept on the other sideof the bed (even though it meant walking all the way around to the far side ofthe room to get in and out of bed).She reported, “Ridiculous as that may sound, I was just intent on giving my bodyas many new and different signals as possible, and since moving to a big housein the Hamptons wasn’t realistic, these tiny things would have to do.”Laurie even put notes everywhere in her environment to remind herself to stayconscious and to elicit thoughts and feelings about her future. She wrote, “I amgrateful,” “Elevate!” and “Love!” on painter’s tape and stuck the notes on thebacks of several doors. She stuck a sticky note on her dashboard that read,“Your thoughts are incredibly powerful. Choose yours wisely.” Encouraging notesand affirmations weren’t new to her, but she’d never had the capacity to believethem before because she hadn’t known how to change her beliefs.In late January 2013, when she saw her orthopedist again, he told her for thefirst time in 28 years that she had no evidence of fractures—none. Her boneswere whole and undamaged. She wrote to me, “I cannot convey in words the joythis brought me. I now felt empowered and lifted. I know I am more than halfwayacross the river of change.”Her bone cells were now programmed to make new, healthy proteins. Her autonomicnervous system was restoring balance within her body physically, chemically, andemotionally. It was doing the healing for her, through a greater intelligence,and she knew she could trust and surrender more to it now. Her body wascontinuing to respond to a new mind.The month after her appointment with the orthopedist, Laurie flew to Arizona forone of my advanced workshops. An hour after she arrived, she received a phonecall from the doctor’s assistant, who told her that the results from her bloodand urine tests were back and they indicated that her disease was actually stillquite active. Her doctor recommended that she resume intravenous bisphosphonatetherapy for the first time in many years.Laurie was heartbroken. The x-rays had left her with the impression that she waswhole again, but the lab tests indicated otherwise. Within seconds, she had lostperspective and was certain she’d failed. When she told me the news, I reassuredher that her body was still living in the past and just needed more time tocatch up with her mind. I suggested she continue to do the work for a few moremonths and retake the urine test then.Inspired by some of the folks in our workshops who’d changed their health,Laurie went home and did her practice in earnest, feeling more vividly andintensely in her meditations the life that she could have. She stopped imaginingherself with healed bones per se, and just imagined herself as whole ingeneral—vital, glowing, resilient, youthful, and in energetic, good health. Shementally rehearsed and emotionally embraced having everything she wanted, whichincluded a functional, walking body. She told herself that the old lady she’dbeen from ages 19 to 47 was just a story from the past.New Mind, New BodyOver the next few months, Laurie simply began to feel happier, more joyful,freer, and healthier. She began to think with more clarity about her future. Sherarely felt pain in her body and walked without any assistance.When May 2013 arrived, she was feeling some trepidation about her appointment toretake the lab test. She postponed the appointment until June. Then Lauriediscussed her hesitation and anxiety with an experienced workshop student, whoasked her to think about some good things she could imagine related to walkinginto the hospital and taking the test. At this point, Laurie realized she hadlots of positive, life-giving emotional resources to draw on. She began recitinga long list, including how clean the hospital was, how helpful all the staffalways were, what an easy place it was to go to just be taken care of. It wasexactly the shift in focus she needed.On the day of the appointment, as she drove to the hospital, Laurie gave thanksfor the sunshine, for how well traffic was moving, for her car, for her leg thatwas helping to operate the car, for her perfect eyesight, for the parking spotshe easily found, and so on. As she later described to me, “I went inside, gavethem my name, shut my eyes, and meditated in the waiting room until it was myturn. I peed in a cup, handed the nurse the bag, and walked out, giving thanksfor the simple act of walking. And I let go of the result—entirely. I was okay,deep down inside, with either outcome. It enabled me to forget about itentirely, because I wasn’t expecting anything. I felt happy, in fact,obsessively grateful. I stopped analyzing and just trusted.”She remembered my saying that the moment she began to analyze how or when herhealing would happen, it would mean she was just returning back to the old self,because the new self would never think in that unsure way. Laurie continued,“And so, for no reason, I was simply grateful in the present moment ahead of theactual experience. I wasn’t waiting for the results to make me happy orthankful; I was in a state of authentic gratitude and in love with life as if ithad already happened. I no longer needed something outside of me to make mehappy. I was already whole and happy, because something inside of me was morewhole and complete.”She had almost nothing on any external “grand scale” by which to measuresuccess, satisfaction, and security—not income, a house, a partner, a business,a child, not even any recent volunteer work she was particularly proud of. ButLaurie had the love of her friends and those family members whom she couldconnect with. And she had a newfound love for herself. She’d realized that she’dnever had self-love before—only self-interest. She told me later that it was adistinction that she never could have understood in her previous, narrow stateof mind. She felt quite content with herself and her life. She said, “And forthe first time since I began this journey, I just didn’t care about the test. Iwas happy with myself.”Two joyful weeks later, the test results came back. The doctor’s assistant toldLaurie, “Your results are perfectly normal. You scored a 40. Your values aredown from an abnormal, elevated level of 68, just five months ago.”Laurie had crossed the river and was on the shores of a new life. There was noevidence of her past living in her body any longer. She was free—born anew.Laurie told me later:It occurred to me in an instant that my identity as “patient” and “sick personwith a disease” had become stronger than any other role I’d played in life. Ihad pretended to be that person, but all along I knew I wasn’t. All of myattention and energy were consumed with being a patient instead of with being awoman, a girlfriend, a daughter, an employee, or even just a happy and wholeperson. I now know that I had no available energy to be anyone else until I tookmy attention off my old personality and old self, and reinvested my attentionand energy into a new self. I’m so grateful that now I’m me instead of that!Laurie now has no regrets and no significant resentments, and she feels no lossover the past. As she puts it, “I wouldn’t want to judge or hold a grudge orfeel forsaken from my past, because that choice would take away this feeling ofwholeness. It’s as if my past condition was actually a blessing, because Iovercame my own limitations and now I’m in love with who I am. I’m at peace. Iam truly changed on the biological and cellular level. I am proof of the messagethat your mind can heal your body, and believe me, no one is more surprised thanI am.”Candace’s StoryCandace’s relationship, barely a year old, just wasn’t working. After theirfirst few months together, she and her boyfriend became deeply embroiled inincessant fighting, volatile accusations, constant mistrust, and ceaseless actsof blame. They both felt jealous and insecure, so their communications werefrustrating, at best. They each were haunted by unfulfilled expectations thatthe other had no hope of satisfying. In a rage she’d never known, Candace foundherself in violent screaming matches, throwing uncontrollable tantrums. Thesefits left her feeling more unworthy, more victimized, and more insecure. All ofthis behavior was new to her; she hadn’t been an angry, frustrated, or upsetperson before, and she’d never thrown a tantrum in all the 28 years of her life.Although she knew on a gut level that staying in those circumstances wasn’tbenefiting her, Candace couldn’t escape the emotional attachment to thisunhealthy relationship. Yet as she became addicted to her stressful emotions,this became her new identity. Her personal reality was creating her newpersonality. Candace’s external environment was controlling how she wasthinking, acting, and feeling. She’d become a victim trapped in her own life.Flooded with the strong energy of survival emotions, Candace began to operatelike an addict, needing that emotional rush of feelings and believing that itwas something out there that was causing her to feel and think and react incertain ways. She couldn’t think or act greater than how she felt. Imprisoned inthis emotional state, she was re-creating the same thoughts, the same choices,the same behaviors, and the same experiences over and over again.Candace was actually using her boyfriend and all of the conditions in her outerworld to reaffirm who she thought she was. Her need to feel anger, frustration,insecurity, unworthiness, fear, and victimization was associated with thatrelationship. Even though it wasn’t serving her greatest ideal, she was tooafraid of change to remedy the situation. In fact, she became so bonded to thoseemotions, because they reaffirmed her identity, that she would rather feel thosefamiliar toxic feelings constantly than leave and embrace the unfamiliar—to stepfrom the known into the unknown. Candace began to believe that she was heremotions, and as a result, she memorized a personality based on the past thatshe’d created.About three months after things began to really go downhill, Candace’s bodycouldn’t sustain the stress of that heightened emotional state, and her hairstarted falling out in very large chunks; within weeks, almost a third of it wasgone. She began experiencing severe migraines, chronic fatigue, gastrointestinalissues, poor concentration, insomnia, weight gain, consistent pain, and myriadother debilitating symptoms—all of them quietly destroying her.An intuitive young woman, Candace innately felt that this “dis-ease” was aself-inflicted product of her own emotional issues. Just thinking about herrelationship would physiologically knock her out of balance in preparation foranother conflict. Candace was turning on stress hormones and her autonomicnervous system by thought alone. And when she thought about her partner, ortalked or complained about their relationship to her family and friends, she wasconditioning her body to the mind of those emotions. It was the ultimatemind-body connection, and because she couldn’t turn off the stress response,eventually she began downregulating genes. Her thoughts were literally makingher sick.Six months into the relationship, Candace was still living in utter dysfunction,at the highest levels of stress. Even though she was sure by now that thesymptoms in her body were a warning sign, she subconsciously continued to choosethe same reality, which was now her normal state of being. Barraging her bodywith negative survival emotions, Candace was signaling the wrong genes in thewrong ways. She felt that she was slowly dying from the inside out, and she knewshe needed to take control of her life but had no idea how to go about doing it.She couldn’t find the courage to leave the relationship, so she remained in itfor over a year, living in a habitual mire of resentment and anger the entiretime. Justified or not in feeling those emotions, Candace watched her body paythe price.Candace Pays the PiperIn November 2010, Candace finally saw a medical doctor, who diagnosed her withHashimoto’s disease (also referred to as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or chroniclymphocytic thyroiditis), an autoimmune disease in which the immune systemattacks the thyroid gland. The condition is marked by hypothyroidism (anunderactive thyroid) with occasional bouts of hyperthyroidism (an overactivethyroid). Symptoms of Hashimoto’s include weight gain, depression, mania,sensitivity to heat and cold, numbness, chronic fatigue, panic attacks, abnormalheart rate, high cholesterol, low blood sugar, constipation, migraines, muscleweakness, joint stiffness, cramps, memory loss, vision problems, infertility,and hair loss—many of which Candace was experiencing.During the consultation, the endocrinologist told Candace that her condition wasgenetic and she could do nothing about it. She would have Hashimoto’s for therest of her life and would need to take thyroid medication indefinitely, becauseher antibody count would never change. Although Candace discovered later thatshe actually had no family history of this illness, the die seemed cast.Having an actual diagnosis gave Candace the unexpected gift of awareness. She’dclearly needed a wake-up call, and this was it. The physical breakdown of herbody had caused her to reflect on her past and really see the truth of who shewas being. It dawned on her that she was single-handedly responsible forcreating an autoimmune illness that was slowly destroying her physically,emotionally, and mentally. She was living a life in constant-emergency fashion.All of her body’s energy was going toward keeping her safe in her externalenvironment, and no energy was left for her internal environment. Her immunesystem couldn’t manage itself any longer.Despite the gut-wrenching fear of change and of the unfamiliar, Candace finallychose to leave the relationship five months later. She fully understood that therelationship had been unhealthy and not served her. She asked herself, What’sthe trade-off? Stay in the dysfunction and propel myself deeper into darkness?Or choose freedom and possibility? This is my chance for a new and differentlife.Candace’s adversity became the genesis for her personal evolution,self-reflection, and expansion. She found herself standing on the edge of thecliff, wanting to leap into the unknown. Her decision to jump and to changebecame a passionate experience. So jump she did, into what she saw as endlesspossibilities and potentials, compelled by a desire to finally stop doing whatwas no longer loving to her so that she could rewrite her biological code.This was a turning point in Candace’s life. She’d read my two previous books andbeen to one of my beginning workshops, so she knew that if she embraced herdiagnosis and the emotions of fear, worry, anxiety, and sadness it inspired, shewould be autosuggesting and believing only in thoughts equal to those feelings.She could try to think positively, but her body was feeling bad, so that wouldhave real consequences. Making that choice would be the wrong placebo, the wrongstate of being.So Candace chose instead not to accept her illness. She respectfully declinedthe physician’s diagnosis, reminding herself that the mind that creates illnessis the same mind that creates wellness. She knew she had to change her beliefsabout the condition given to her by the medical community. Candace chose not tobe suggestible to her doctor’s advice and opinions, because she wasn’t fearful,victimized, or sad.In fact, she was optimistic and enthusiastic, and those emotions drove a new setof thoughts that allowed her to see a new possibility. She didn’t accept herdiagnosis, prognosis, or treatment; believe hastily in the most probable outcomeor future destiny; or permanently surrender to the diagnosis or treatment plan.She didn’t condition her body to that future worst-case scenario, expect thesame predictable outcome that everyone else did, or assign the same meaning thateveryone else with the condition did. She had a different attitude, so she wasnow in a different state of being.Candace Gets BusyEven though Candace didn’t accept her condition, she had a lot of work ahead ofher. She knew that to change her belief about her disease, she’d have to make achoice with an amplitude of energy that was greater than the hardwired programsin her brain and the emotional addictions in her body so that her body couldrespond to a new mind. Only then could she experience the necessary change inenergy that she needed to rewrite her subconscious programs and erase her pastneurologically and genetically—which is exactly what began to happen.Although she had heard me say all of this before and knew the materialintellectually, Candace had never embraced the information from personalexperience. In the first workshop she attended after getting the diagnosis, shelooked exhausted and kept falling asleep in her chair. I knew she wasstruggling.When she came to her next workshop, she’d been taking thyroid medication toregulate her imbalanced chemical state for a little over a month, and she wasmore alert and interested. Candace was incredibly inspired by the stories I toldduring the weekend. When she heard that others weren’t going to be victims ofthe circumstances in their external worlds and that uncommon healings couldhappen, she decided that she was going to be her own science project.So Candace embarked on the journey. Having an understanding of epigenetics andneuroplasticity from my workshops, she knew she was no longer a victim of thedisease and, instead, used her knowledge to become proactive. She assigned adifferent meaning to her future and so had a different intention. She awokeevery day at 4:30 A.M. to do her meditation and began to emotionally conditionher body to a new mind. She worked on finding the present moment, which sherealized had been lost to her before.Candace wanted to be happy and healthy, so she fought hard to regain her life.Even so, she struggled in the beginning and got very frustrated when shecouldn’t sit for any extended period of time. Her body had been trained to bethe mind of frustration, anger, impatience, and victimization, and itunderstandably rebelled. As though she were training an undisciplined animal,Candace had to keep settling her body down to the present moment. Every time shewent through that process, she was reconditioning her body to a new mind andfreeing herself a bit more from the chains of her emotional addiction.Every day in her meditations, Candace worked on overcoming her body, herenvironment, and time. She refused to get up as the same person who’d sat downto do the meditation, because the old Candace was the one who became angry andfrustrated and was so chemically addicted to her external circumstances. Shedidn’t want to be that person anymore. She listened to her meditations, emulateda new state of being, and wouldn’t stop until she was in love with life—in atrue state of gratitude for no particular reason.Candace applied all the knowledge that she’d learned from my workshops and fromlistening to every audio CD, reading every book (more than once), and studyingher notes from the courses. She was wiring new information into her brain toprepare herself for a new experience of healing. More and more often, she foundthat she could refrain from firing and wiring the old neural connections ofanger, frustration, resentment, arrogance, and mistrust and that she could beginto fire and wire the new neural connections of love, joy, compassion, andkindness. In doing so, Candace knew she was pruning away the old connections andsprouting new ones. And the more times she made the effort with a level ofmental fortitude, the more she would transform.In time, she became incredibly grateful to be alive, realizing that whereharmony existed, incoherence couldn’t abide. She told herself, I am not the oldCandace, and I’m not reaffirming that existence any longer. For months on end,she persevered. And if she found herself being driven to that lowest commondenominator, being angry or frustrated at the conditions in her external world,or feeling sick or unhappy, she would very quickly make a conscious shift. Byswiftly changing her state of being, she could shorten the periods in whichthose emotions had a hold on her so that she was overall less moody, lesstemperamental, and less like her old personality.Some days Candace felt so bad that she didn’t want to get out of bed, but shegot up anyway and meditated. She told herself that whenever she transmuted thoselower emotions into elevated emotions, she was removing herself biologicallyfrom her past and priming her brain and body to a new future. She began torealize how worthwhile doing her inner work was, and it soon became less likeeffort and more like a gift.Thanks to her daily persistence, Candace noticed a huge shift very quickly, andshe started feeling better. She started communicating with others differentlyonce she stopped looking at the world through a mind of fear and frustration,and instead looked through a lens of compassion, love, and gratitude. Her energyincreased, and she was able to think more clearly.Candace realized that she didn’t react the same way to the familiar conditionsin her life, because the old fear-based emotions were no longer within her body.She was overcoming her knee-jerk reactions, because she now saw that the peopleand conditions that used to upset her existed only in relation to how she wasfeeling. She was becoming free.Part of her process of change included becoming conscious of the unconsciousthoughts that typically slipped by her awareness during the day. In hermeditations, she became determined that those thoughts would never go unnoticedagain. Under no circumstances would she allow herself to return to the behaviorsand habits connected to her old self. She erased the chalkboard biologically,neurologically, and genetically, making room to create a new self, and her bodybegan to liberate energy. In other words, she was going from particle to wave byreleasing the stored emotions as energy in her body. Her body was no longerliving the past.With this newly available energy that she’d freed up, Candace began to see thelandscape of a new future. She asked herself, How do I want to behave? How do Iwant to feel? How do I want to think? By getting up every day for months on endin a state of gratitude, she was emotionally instructing her body that her newfuture had already arrived, which signaled new genes in new ways, moving herbody back into homeostasis. Right on the other side of Candace’s anger, shefound compassion. Right on the other side of her frustration, she discoveredpatience and gratitude. And right on the other side of her victimization was acreator, waiting to create joy and wellness. It was the same intense energy oneither side, but she was now able to liberate it as she moved from particle towave, from survival to creation.Sweet, Sweet SuccessWhen Candace returned to her doctor seven months after her diagnosis, he wasamazed by the change in his patient. Her blood tests had come back perfect. Inher initial round of tests in February 2011, her thyroid-stimulating hormone(TSH) had been 3.61 (which is high), and her antibody count had been 638(showing a major imbalance). But by September 2011, Candace’s TSH had dropped toa normal 1.15, and her antibody count was a healthy 450, even though she was nolonger taking any medication. She’d healed herself in less than one year.The doctor wanted to know just what she’d been doing to get these great results.It seemed almost too good to be true. Candace explained that she knew she’dcreated this condition, so she’d decided to conduct an experiment on herself touncreate it. She told the doctor that by meditating daily and maintaining anelevated state of emotion, she had been epigenetically signaling new genesinstead of letting unhealthy emotions continue to signal the old genes. Sheexplained that she’d worked regularly on who she wanted to become and that she’dstopped responding to everything in her external environment like an animal insurvival mode: fighting, fleeing, kicking, or screaming. Everything around herwas basically the same; she was just responding in a way that was more loving toherself.The doctor told her, looking absolutely amazed, “I wish all my patients werelike you, Candace. It’s just incredible to hear your story.”Candace doesn’t really know how her healing happened. She doesn’t need to. Shejust knows that she has become someone else.I had dinner with Candace a while after all this happened, at a point when shehad been off her medication for months and had no symptoms at all. Her healthwas fantastic, all her hair had grown back, and she felt great about herself.She mentioned over and over again that she was so in love with her present life.I told her, laughing, “You’re in love with life, and it’s loving you back. Youshould be in love with your life—you created it every day for months that way!”Candace explained that she just trusted in an infinite field of potentials andknew that something else was going on beyond her that had helped her heal. Allshe really had to do was to get beyond herself and enter into the autonomicnervous system, and then keep planting the seeds for a new life. And withoutknowing how it happened, it just happened—and when it did, she felt better thanshe’d ever felt before.Candace’s life is now completely different from her life when she was diagnosedwith Hashimoto’s. She’s a business partner in a personal development programthat teaches self-development work, and she also maintains a corporate job. Shehas a loving relationship, new friendships, and new business opportunities. Anew personality ultimately creates a new personal reality.A state of being is a magnetic force that draws events equal to that state ofbeing, so when Candace fell in love with herself, she drew a loving relationshipto herself. Because she felt worthy and felt respect for herself and all oflife, conditions began to show up for her in which she had opportunities tocontribute, to be respected, and to make a difference in the world. And ofcourse, when she moved into a new personality, the old personality became likeanother lifetime. That new physiology began to drive her to greater levels ofjoy and inspiration—and the disease then belonged to the old personality. Shewas someone else.It’s not that she became addicted to joy; she was just no longer addicted tobeing unhappy. When she started experiencing greater levels of happiness, shefound that there’s always more bliss, more joy, and more love to experience,because every experience creates a different blend of emotions. She startedreally wanting the challenges in her life so that she could find out to whatextent she could take this information into transformation.The ultimate lesson that Candace learned was that her disease and her challengeswere never about someone else—they were always about her. In her old state ofbeing, she’d had the firm belief that she was a victim of her relationship andof her external circumstances and that life was always happening to her.Becoming aware of this work and taking full responsibility for herself and herlife—and realizing that what had happened never had anything to do with what wasoutside of her—was not only a huge empowerment, but also one of the greatestgifts Candace could’ve ever asked for.Joann’s StoryJoann lived most of her life in the fast lane. The 59-year-old mother of fivewas also a committed wife, a successful businesswoman, and an entrepreneur whoconstantly juggled her home life, family dynamics, growing career, and thrivingbusiness. Although her goal was to stay sane, healthy, and balanced, shecouldn’t imagine her life any other way than intense, fast paced, and busy; shewas living on the edge and proving to everyone that her mind was active andsharp. Joann constantly pushed herself to take on as much as possible, all thewhile maintaining exceptionally high standards. She was a leader, admired bymany and regularly sought out for advice. Her peers called her “Superwoman,” andshe was—or so she thought.All that ended abruptly in January 2008, when Joann stepped off the elevator inher apartment building and then just collapsed, about 50 feet from her frontdoor. She hadn’t felt well that day, so she’d gone to a walk-in clinic for helpand been on her way back home. In a matter of moments, everything in her worldhad changed, and she found herself clinging to life.After eight months of testing, the doctors diagnosed her with secondaryprogressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), an advanced stage of multiple sclerosis(MS), a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervoussystem. Symptoms vary widely depending on the individual, but can start withconditions such as numbness in a leg or an arm, progressing as far as paralysisand even blindness. These symptoms can include not only physical but alsocognitive and psychiatric problems.Joann’s symptoms had been so vague and sporadic over the previous 14 years thatshe’d easily brushed them off as by-products of a hectic lifestyle. But now hercondition had a label, and it felt like a life sentence—with no chance ofparole. She found herself thrown into the depths of the Western medical world,challenged by its strong belief that MS is a permanent disease.A few years before the diagnosis, Joann had put the family business in Calgaryon hold and made a life-changing move to Vancouver, on the west coast of Canada,something her family had wanted to do for years. After the move, Joann struggledwith one challenge after another as the family’s eroding finances and resourcesput them in a very precarious situation. Joann’s self-esteem, confidence, andhealth all took a nosedive. Once she found herself unable to become greater thanher environment, her mental and physical state began to decline. Money becametighter and tighter as other stressors began to increase. Soon, the familycouldn’t even meet their basic needs of food and shelter. In early 2007, thewoman everyone else had always seen as Superwoman hit bottom, and before the endof the year, the family returned to Calgary.MS is an inflammatory disease in which the insulating coverings of nerve cellsin the brain and spinal cord are damaged, along with the nerve fibersthemselves. The condition disrupts the nervous system from communicating andsending signals to various parts of the body. The type of MS Joann developed isa progressive type that builds up over time, often causing permanentneurological problems, especially as the disease advances. Her doctors told herit was incurable.Initially, Joann was determined that her MS wouldn’t define her. Yet she quicklyspiraled downward into physical disability and cognitive decline. Joann had todepend on others for basic care as her limitations increased. Because of hersensory and motor problems, she began to rely on crutches, walkers, and awheelchair. Eventually she had to rely on a mobility scooter to get around.It wasn’t much of a surprise that she crashed when her life did. Joann’s bodyfinally did her the favor she wouldn’t do herself—that is, to stop and say, “Nomore!” She’d pushed herself too hard. Even though she’d achieved success in herearly years, deep down inside, she felt like a failure most of the time becauseshe constantly judged herself and thought that she could always do a better job.She was never satisfied. Whatever she did or achieved was never good enough.Most important, Joann didn’t want to stop doing, because then she would have toattend to that impending feeling of failure. So instead, she stayed busy byputting all of her attention on her outer world—various experiences with peopleand things at different times and places—so that she wouldn’t have to put anyattention on her inner world of thoughts and feelings.The majority of Joann’s life had been filled with supporting others, bycelebrating their successes and encouraging them, yet she’d never allowed anyoneto see what wasn’t working in her own life. She hid her pain from everyone.Joann constantly gave but never received—because she never allowed herself toreceive—so she’d spent a lifetime denying herself her own personal evolution bynever expressing herself. It makes sense that when Joann tried to change herinner world by using the conditions in her outer world, she would inevitablymanifest only failure.When she finally collapsed, Joann was so weak and defeated that she barely hadthe strength to fight for her life. All that time spent living in emergencymode, constantly reacting to the conditions in her external world, had robbedJoann of her life force, draining all the energy from her internal world—theplace for repair and healing. She was simply tapped out.Joann Changes Her MindThe one thing Joann knew without a doubt was that the damage that the MRIsshowed was riddling her brain and spinal column hadn’t appeared overnight. Herbody had slowly been eaten away at her core—the central nervous system. Afterall those years of ignoring symptoms, she’d become unnerved because she wasafraid to look inside herself. Those daily toxic chemicals were repeatedlyknocking on the door of her cells, and finally the gene for the disease answeredthe door and switched on.Bedridden, Joann made her first goal to slow down the progression of the MS inher body. She knew from reading my first book that the brain doesn’t know thedifference between what she could make real internally by thought alone and thereal external experience, and she knew that mental practice could change herbrain and her body. She started mentally rehearsing doing yoga, and after just afew weeks of daily practice, she was able to do some actual physical poses—evensome standing ones. These results highly motivated her.Every day, Joann primed her brain and body by thought alone. Just like the pianoplayers in Chapter 5 [ch5.html] who mentally rehearsed playing the piano andgrew the same neurological circuits as the subjects who physically practiced theexercises, Joann was installing the circuits in her brain to look as if she werealready physically walking and moving. Remember the subjects in the variousweight-lifting studies who increased their strength just by mentally practicinglifting weights or flexing their biceps? Just like them, Joann knew she couldmake her body look as if the experience of healing had already started tohappen—by literally changing her mind.Soon she was able to stand briefly, and then she could walk with support. Joannwas quite wobbly and otherwise still dependent on a mobility scooter, but atleast she was no longer confined to bed and feeling sorry for herself. She hadturned a corner.When Joann began to meditate regularly to simply quiet her mind chatter, shebecame aware of how sad and angry she really was. The floodgates opened. Joannrealized she felt weak, isolated, rejected, and unworthy most of the time. Outof balance, ungrounded, and disconnected, she felt as though she’d lost a vitalpart of herself. She observed how she denied herself by pleasing others and howshe couldn’t acknowledge herself without feeling guilty. She recognized that shewas always trying to control what seemed to be a spiraling chaos around her, yetit never worked. On a deeper level, she had known this all along but had chosento ignore it, pushing herself relentlessly and pretending that everything wasokay.Painful as it was, Joann was now looking at how she’d created her disease. Shedecided to become conscious of all of those subconscious thoughts, actions, andemotions that were defining her as the same personality who’d created thisparticular personal reality. She knew that once she could look at who she wasbeing, it meant that she’d be able to change those aspects of herself. The moreshe became conscious of her unconscious self and aware of her state of being,the more she gained dominion over what she’d hidden from view.By early 2010, Joann felt that the progression of the MS had indeed slowed. Hergoal then became to stop it altogether. In May, when she mentioned this idea toa neurologist who asked what her goals were with her disease, the doctorabruptly terminated her appointment. Instead of becoming discouraged, Joann wasmore intent after this incident.Taking Her Healing to the Next LevelWhen Joann attended a workshop in Vancouver, she couldn’t walk on her own.During the weekend, I asked the participants to set a firm intention in theirminds and combine it with an elevated emotion in their bodies. The goal was torecondition the body to a new mind, instead of continuing to condition it withsurvival emotions. I wanted participants to open their hearts and teach theirbodies emotionally what their future would feel like. This was the missingingredient to Joann’s daily mental practice. Embracing thoughts of walkingacross a 20- to 25-foot floor with only her cane for support excited her beyondbelief. She was now adding the second element of the placebo effect to theequation: expectation with emotion.It was this combination—convincing her body emotionally that the future event ofhealing was happening to her in the present moment—that would take Joann to thenext level. Her body, as the unconscious mind, had to believe it for it to beso. If she were to embrace the joy of being well and give thanks before thehealing occurred, then her body would be getting a sampling of her future in thepresent moment.I suggested to Joann that she really pay attention to her thoughts, because itwas her thoughts that had truly made her sick. I pressed her to get beyond thepersonality that was connected to her condition, which was necessary before shecould create a new personality and a new personal reality. Now she could applymeaning and intention to what she was doing.Two months after that workshop, Joann attended a second, more advanced workshopin Seattle. Her scooter had broken down the day before she left for that event,so she used her motorized wheelchair to get around. Despite initially feelingmore vulnerable because of that, at the workshop, Joann soon felt better able tomove. Her associative memory related to the positive experience of the lastevent, and the expectation of getting better in the current event, was whatinitiated that process. If 29 percent of chemo patients can experienceanticipatory nausea before their chemo treatments (as you read in Chapter 1[ch1.html]), then maybe it’s possible for some of the workshop participants toexperience anticipatory wellness when they’re back in the workshop setting.Whatever the trigger, Joann saw a new possibility and, with enthusiasm, beganonce again to emotionally embrace that future in the present moment.During the last meditation of that workshop, the magic happened for her. Joannexperienced a huge internal shift, and she felt something that moved herprofoundly. She felt her body changing automatically, once she entered herautonomic nervous system and it received the new instructions and took over. Shefelt lifted, overjoyed, and free. After the meditation, Joann got up from herchair a different person than she’d been when she’d sat down—she was in a newstate of being. She then walked to the front of the room—without any support,not even her cane. She strutted across the room wide-eyed, laughing like achild. She could feel and move her legs, which had been dormant for years.She’d gotten out of the way—and it felt incredible! To my amazement, Joann hadsignaled new genes in new ways right during that one meditation. She’d actuallychanged her condition in just one hour!When she got beyond her MS identity, she became a different person, and that’swhen she stopped trying to slow, stop, or reverse her MS. She no longer tried toprove anything to herself, her family, her doctors, or anyone else. Sheunderstood and experienced for the first time that her true journey was alwaysabout wholeness, which is what verifiable healing is always about. She forgotthat she had an official disease, and she dissociated from that identity for amoment. The freedom that doing so engendered and the amplitude of that elevatedemotion were strong enough to switch on a new gene. Joann knew that MS wassimply a label, like “mother,” “wife,” or “boss.” She had changed that label bysimply giving up her past.More MiraclesWhen Joann arrived back home three days later, unbeknownst to her, themiraculous continued to unfold. While doing yoga, a practice she’d begunphysically—not just mentally—after attending the second workshop, she noticedthat she could lift one foot off the ground. She tried to lift theother—success! She then noticed that she could flex her feet for the first timein years. And she could wiggle her toes, which she hadn’t done in a long time.She was stunned and in absolute awe as tears of joy flowed from her eyes. Sheknew in that instant that anything was possible, not because of some externalmedication or procedure, but because of the internal changes she’d made. Joannknew she could be her own placebo.Within a very short time, Joann taught herself how to walk again. Two yearslater, she is still walking unassisted and is more playful and full of life. Herbody strength has improved, and she’s now able to do many things that shethought she’d never again be able to do. Most important, she feels alive andfilled with boundless joy. Joann feels whole, and because she can now receive,she continues to receive healing.Joann recently told me, “My life is magical, full of incredible synergies,abundance, and unexpected gifts of every sort. It bubbles, sparkles, and tingleswith a new and lighter reflection of myself. It’s the new me—actually, the realme that I’d tried to keep under control and hidden for most of my life!”Joann now lives most of her day in gratitude. She still takes the time to beaware of her thoughts and feelings; that is, she cultivates her state of beingevery day, paying attention to what she tells herself and what she thinks aboutothers, too. In her meditations, she observes herself and becomes familiar withhow she acts. Very rarely does a thought get past her conscious mind that shedoesn’t want to experience.Joann’s current neurologist supports her choices and has been astounded by whatshe has seen. Her physician has had to acknowledge the power of the mind, whichJoann demonstrated right before her eyes with medical reports and blood teststhat show no signs of MS.image [images/line1.jpg]Laurie, Candace, and Joann accomplished their dramatic remissions using noresources outside of themselves. They changed their health from the insideout—without the use of medication, surgery, therapy, or anything other thantheir own minds. They became their own placebos.Now, let’s take a scientific look into the brains of some other people from myworkshops who were able to make similar dramatic changes so that we can seeexactly what was going on in the process of these remarkable transformations.image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Ten [toc.html#a14]Information to Transformation: Proof That You Are the Placebo [toc.html#a14]This book is about making your mind matter. You now understand that the placeboworks because a person accepts and believes in a known remedy—a fake pill,injection, or procedure substituted for its real counterpart—and then surrendersto the outcome without overanalyzing how it’s going to happen. We could say thata person associates her future experience of a particular known person (say, adoctor) or thing (a medication or procedure) at a specific time and place in herexternal environment with a change in her internal environment—and in doing so,she alters her state of being. After a few consistent experiences, the personwill expect her future to be exactly like her past. Once that link is in place,the process becomes highly effective. It’s about a known stimulus automaticallyproducing a known response.The bottom line is this: In the classic placebo effect, our belief lies insomething outside of us. We give our power away to the material world, where oursenses define reality. But can the placebo work by creating from the immaterialworld of thought and making that unknown possibility a new reality? That wouldbe a more prudent use of the quantum model.The three workshop participants you read about in the last chapter accomplishedthis feat. They all chose to believe in themselves more than they believed inanything else. They changed from the inside and moved into the same state ofbeing as someone who’d taken a placebo—without any material thing causing thephenomenon. That’s what many students continue to do to get better. Once theyknow how the placebo really works, the pill, injection, or procedure can betaken away, and the same outcome unfolds.Because of the research in these workshops, as well as the constant testimonialsI’ve received from people around the world, I now know that you are the placebo.My students demonstrate that instead of investing their belief in the known,they can place their belief in the unknown and make the unknown known.Think about this for a moment. The idea of verifiable healing exists as anunknown potential reality in the quantum field, until it is observed andrealized, and has materialized. It lives as a possibility in an infinite fieldof information defined as nothing physically but all material possibilitiescombined. So the potential future of experiencing a spontaneous remission from adisease exists as an unknown located beyond space and time, until it’spersonally experienced and made known in this space and time. Once the unknownbeyond the senses becomes a known experience with your senses, you’re on thepath of evolution.So if you can experience a healing over and over again in the inner world ofthoughts and feelings, then in time, that healing should finally manifest as anouter experience. And if you make a thought as real as the experience in theexternal environment, shouldn’t there be evidence in your body and brain sooneror later? In other words, if you mentally rehearse that unknown future with aclear intention and an elevated emotion, and do it repeatedly, then based onwhat you’ve learned, you should have real neuroplastic changes in your brain andepigenetic changes in your body.And if you keep moving into a new state of being each day by reminding yourbrain and conditioning your body to that same mind, then you should see the samestructural and functional changes within you as if you took the placebo. Figure10.1 gives a simple graphic showing how this process unfolds.image [images/235.jpg]Most change starts with the simple process of something outside of us alteringsomething inside of us. If you begin the inward journey and start to change yourinner world of thoughts and feelings, it should create an improved state ofwell-being. If you keep repeating the process in meditation, then in time,epigenetic changes should begin to alter your outer presentation—and you becomeyour own placebo.So instead of aligning your faith (which I define as believing in a thought morethan anything else) and your belief in something known, can you place yourattention on an unknown possibility and then, by the principles discussed inthis book, make that unknown reality known? By emotionally embracing theexperience in your mind enough times, can you move from the immaterial to thematerial—from thought to reality?By now, you should understand that you don’t need any fake pills, holy shrines,ancient symbols, witch doctors (whether of the modern-day or traditionalvariety), sham surgery, or sacred ground in order to heal you. This chapterintroduces the scientific evidence showing how our students did just that. Theychanged their biology by thought alone. It wasn’t just in their minds—it was intheir brains.All of the supporting evidence in this chapter is provided to inspire you tosee, firsthand, the power of meditation. It’s my desire that once you see proofof what’s possible, you’ll apply the same principles to your own personaltransformation and reap the benefits in all areas of your life. After you readthese stories, by the time you get to Part II [p2.html] of the book, you’ll havemore intention behind your inward journey, because you’ll assign more meaning towhat you’re doing—and therefore you’ll get better results.From Knowledge to ExperienceI’ve learned something very important in teaching this work. I’ve come to therealization that everyone secretly believes in his or her greatness. When youget right down to it, on some level, everyone—whether you’re a corporate CEO, ajanitor at an elementary school, a single mother of three, or a prisoninmate—innately believes in him- or herself.We all believe in possibility. We all imagine a better future for ourselves thanthe reality where we currently reside. So I thought that if I could offersincere individuals vital scientific information and then provide them with thenecessary instruction on how to apply that information, they could experiencevarying degrees of personal transformation. Science is, after all, thecontemporary language of mysticism. It transcends religion, culture, andtradition. It demystifies the mystical and unifies a community. I’ve seen itoccur time and time again in my seminars around the world.In my advanced workshops where my colleagues and I measure biological as well asenergetic changes in participants, individually and in the group as a whole, Iuse several principles outlined in this book (and many additional ones as well)to teach people the scientific model of transformation. The model continues toprogress as students evolve their skill sets. I constantly tie in more quantumphysics to help people understand possibility. I then combine it with the latestinformation in neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, epigenetics, cellular biology,brain-wave science, energy psychology, and psychoneuroimmunology. We see newpossibilities manifest as a result of learning new information.Once our students learn and embrace this information, they can assign moremeaning to their meditations and contemplative practices. But it’s not enoughfor the students to merely understand the information intellectually orconceptually. They must be able to repeat what they’ve learned on command. Oncethey can explain the advancing knowledge, the progressing model will become morewired in their brains—and they can then install the neurological hardware. Bythen repeating what they’ve learned enough times, they create a hardwiredsoftware program. If they apply this new knowledge correctly, it can then serveas the forerunner to a new experience.That is, once they align their minds and bodies, they’ll gain wisdom from anovel experience by embracing the associated new emotion. Now they’ll start toembody the information, because they are chemically instructing their bodies toemotionally understand what their minds intellectually understand. At thispoint, they’ll begin to believe and know that it’s the truth. But my desire isthat instead of just doing it once, my students repeat the experience over andover again at will, until it becomes a new skill, habit, or state of being.Once we achieve consistency, we’re on the precipice of a new scientificparadigm—because anything that’s repeatable is science. When you and I arrive atthe level of competence where we can change our internal states by thoughtalone, and this is repeatedly observed, measured, and documented, we’re on theverge of a new scientific law. Now we can contribute new knowledge about thenature of reality to the overall scientific model that the world presentlyembraces so that we can empower more people. This has been my ambition foryears.I’ve gone to great lengths to teach our workshop participants the specifics ofhow inward practices biologically change the brain and body so that theyunderstand explicitly what they are doing. When nothing is left to conjecture,dogma, or supposition, we’re more suggestible to a quantum possibility. Andgreat strides result from great efforts. Nevertheless, the measurements are onlyas good as the students’ abilities.So in my workshops, the students retreat from their lives for three to five daysto help them no longer define themselves by their present-past personal reality.They practice moving into new states of being. By no longer reaffirming aspectsof their old-personality self that don’t belong to their future and bypretending to be someone else—or by reinventing a new-personality self—theybecome the new self they envision, so they should produce epigenetic changes,just as did the older men in Chapter 4 [ch4.html] who pretended they were 22years younger.It’s my desire that workshop participants get beyond themselves—and theiridentities—in their meditations to become no body, no one, no thing, and to bein no place and in no time—so that they become pure consciousness. Once thisoccurs, I’ve seen them change their brains and bodies ahead of theirenvironments (their familiar lives) so that when they return to their livesafter the workshop is over, they’re no longer the victims of unconsciousconditioning from the external world. This is the domain where the uncommon andthe miraculous happen.Because I want to give students the right kind of instruction and provide themwith opportunities to personalize all of the novel information they’re learningso that they can ultimately produce some type of personal transformation, Icreated a new kind of event in 2013. If you remember, I discussed the evolutionof this idea in the Preface. In this new workshop offering (held first inFebruary of that year in Carefree, Arizona, and again in July in Englewood,Colorado), I wanted to measure the transformation as it was happening in realtime.My intention was that once these measurements were obtained, the data would thenbecome more information that I could use to teach participants about thetransformation they’d just experienced. And with that information, they couldhave another transformation, which could be measured, and on it would go aspeople began to close the gap between the two worlds of knowledge andexperience. I call these workshops “Information to Transformation.” It’s wheremy passion lies.Measuring ChangeWhen I began the journey, I discovered a brilliant and talented neuroscientistnamed Jeffrey Fannin, Ph.D., who selflessly helped me measure what students’brains were doing. Dr. Fannin, the founder and executive director of the Centerfor Cognitive Enhancement in Glendale, Arizona, has worked in the field ofneuroscience for more than 15 years and has extensive experience in training thebrain for optimal performance. He specializes in head trauma, stroke, chronicpain, attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention deficit hyperactivitydisorder (ADHD), anxiety disorders, depression, and trauma recovery, as well ashigh-performance training that includes brain mapping for sports, enhancingleadership skills through brain-wave entrainment, improving brain function,enhancing mental and emotional dexterity, and personal transformation.Over the years, he has been involved in cutting-edge research usingelectroencephalograph (EEG) technology (which measures the electrical activityof neurons) to accurately assess how balanced a person’s brain-wave energy is, ameasurement he calls the person’s whole-brain state. His research focuses onsubconscious belief patterns and merging personal success with balanced brainperformance.Dr. Fannin has also worked as part of a research team at Arizona StateUniversity, studying neuroscience and leadership using data gathered at theUnited States Military Academy at West Point. This research allowed him toco-develop and co-teach a unique course at Arizona State University called “TheNeuroscience of Leadership.” He also served for several years on the faculty atWalden University near Phoenix, teaching cognitive neuroscience at the master’sand doctoral levels.I invited Dr. Fannin and his whole team to both of these new workshop events,where we measured specific brain qualities and elements like coherence versusincoherence (the orderliness or disorderliness of brain waves), amplitude (theenergy of the brain waves), phase organization (the degree to which thedifferent parts of the brain are working together in harmony), the relative timeit takes for a person to enter deep meditation (how long it takes to changebrain waves and move into a more suggestible state), the theta/alpha ratio (thedegree to which the brain functions in a holistic state and how different braincompartments communicate with each other across entire regions—the front withthe back and the left side with the right side), the delta/theta ratio (theability to regulate and control mind chatter and intrusive thoughts), andsustainability (the brain’s ability to consistently maintain a state ofmeditation over time).We also created four brain-scan stations equipped with EEG machines to measureparticipants both before and after the workshop so that we could observe howstudents’ brain-wave patterns changed. We scanned more than a hundredparticipants in each of the two events. I also randomly selected fourparticipants to measure during each of three meditation sessions per day,scanning their brains in real time. Altogether, in both 2013 workshops, werecorded a total of 402 EEGs. This is a safe, noninvasive procedure that takesmeasurements from 20 locations on the outside of the head. Those brain-wavemeasurements provide a host of information regarding the brain’s current abilityto perform.The EEGs were then converted into quantitative EEGs (QEEGs), which is amathematical and statistical analysis of EEG activity that’s depicted as abrain-map graphic. This graphic features color gradations indicating how theactivity recorded from the EEG compares to normal baseline activity. The variouscolors and patterns depicted at different frequencies offer greater informationabout how the brain-wave patterns affect a person’s thoughts, feelings,emotions, and behaviors.For starters, our overall data demonstrated that 91 percent of the individualswhose EEGs we recorded presented a significantly improved state of brainfunction. The majority of our students moved from a less coherent (or lessorderly) state to a more coherent state by the end of the transformationalmeditation sessions. Furthermore, more than 82 percent of the QEEG brain maps werecorded in both events demonstrated that participants were functioning withinthe healthy normal range of brain activity.I learned that when your brain works right, you work right. When your brain ismore coherent, you’re more coherent. When your brain is more whole and balanced,you’re more whole and balanced. When you can regulate your negative andintrusive thoughts every day, you’re less negative and intrusive. And that’sexactly what we witnessed with the students at these events.The national average for someone to move into and sustain a meditative state isa little over one and a half minutes.1 [endnote.html#fnh-1] That is, it takesthat long for most people to change their brain waves and move into a meditativestate. The average time for our students to enter and sustain a meditative statein the 402 cases that we measured was only 59 seconds. That’s under a minute.Some of our students were able to alter their brain waves (and their state ofbeing) in as few as four, five, and nine seconds each.To be clear, I’m not interested in making this a competition (which would defeatour purpose). However, this data does illustrate two important points. First,moving beyond the analytical mind of beta brain waves and entering into a moresuggestible state is a skill that you can improve if you keep practicing it.Second, students are able to use the methods my colleagues and I are teaching toget beyond their thinking brains and enter into the operating system of thesubconscious mind relatively easily.Interestingly, our research also shows a noticeable, consistent patterning inthe way our students’ brains work holistically. We see significant alternatingalpha/theta patterns (how different brain compartments communicate with eachother) in the frontal lobes when a person meditates. That means the two halvesof the brain are talking in a more balanced and unified fashion. The dualfrontal-lobe ratio patterns we repeatedly observe seem to produce the experienceof high-level thankfulness and gratitude, which appear over and over again in arhythmic, wavelike manner. So when students are in this heightened state ofgratitude during mental rehearsal, this data suggests that their innerexperience is so real that they believe that the events are happening to them inreal time—or that the events have already happened. They’re thankful, becausethat’s the emotion we feel when what we want happens.Experienced meditators also showed an increase in theta and lower-range alphabrain-wave ratios, which means that they can spend quite a bit of time inaltered states. Of particular significance was the increase in slow-waveregulation; these students, while in a theta brain-wave state, havehigher-than-normal coherence, or brain-wave orderliness, between the activity inthe front of the brain and the regions in the back of the brain. We saw theleft-frontal region, which is associated with positive emotion, get activatedrepeatedly, which is consistent with inducing a state of meditative bliss.In other words, when these students enter a meditation, they produce slower,more coherent brain waves that suggest they’re in deep states of relaxation andheightened awareness. In addition, the unification between the front and theback of the brain, as well as between the left and right sides of the brain,indicates that they’re feeling happier and more whole.I Have a BrainstormFinally, while I was observing a student who was being brain mapped in real timeduring a meditation at the first of the two events, I understood something quiteremarkable. As I was watching her brain on the scan, I saw how hard she wasworking and how her brain was moving further and further away from balance andfrom the deeper meditative states of alpha and theta. I saw how she wasanalyzing and judging herself and her life within the emotion she wasexperiencing at that time—as evidenced by the higher, more incoherent brainwaves associated with a high-range beta state (indicating high stress, highanxiety, high arousal, high emergency, and general imbalance).I witnessed how she was futilely trying to use her brain to change her brain—andit wasn’t working. I knew that she was also using her ego to try to change herego, which also wasn’t working. In using one program to try to change anotherprogram, she was only endorsing her program, not rewriting it. She was still inher conscious mind, trying to change her subconscious mind, so she was keepingherself separate from the operating system, where true change resides. Iapproached her afterward, and when we spoke for a few minutes, she admitted tome that she was having a difficult time. The lights went on for me in thatmoment, and I knew exactly what I had to teach next.She had to become detached and move beyond her body in order to change her body,move beyond the ego in order to change the ego, move beyond the program in orderto change the program, and move beyond the conscious mind in order to change thesubconscious mind. She had to become the unknown in order to create the unknown.She had to become an immaterial new thought in nothing materially in order tocreate a new experience materially. She had to move beyond space and time inorder to change space and time.The student had to become pure consciousness. She had to get beyond herassociations with an identity that was associated with her known environment(her home, her job, her spouse, her kids, her problems), beyond her body (herface, her gender, her age, her weight, and her looks), and beyond time (thepredictable habit of living in the past or the future, always missing thepresent moment). She had to get beyond her current self to create a new self.She had to get out of her own way so that something greater could take over.When we are matter trying to change matter, it never works. When we are theparticle trying to change the particle, nothing will happen, because we’revibrating at the same speed as matter and so can’t have any significant effecton it. It’s our consciousness (our intentional thought) and our energy (ourelevated emotion) that influences matter. Only when we are consciousness can wealter our brains, our bodies, and our lives and create a new future in time.And because it’s consciousness that gives form to all things and that uses thebrain and body to produce different levels of mind, once you arrive in the placewhere you are pure consciousness, you’re free. So I began to let students lingerfor extended periods of time in their meditations and become no one, no body, nothing, and be in no place and in no time, until they were comfortable in theinfinite field of possibilities.I wanted students’ subjective consciousness to merge with the objectiveconsciousness of the field for long periods of time. They had to find the sweetspot of the present moment and invest their energy and awareness in a void thatis not really empty space but is actually filled with an infinite number ofpossibilities, until they were comfortable in the unknown. Only once they weretruly present in this potent place beyond space and time—the place from whereall things materially come—could they start to create. This was when the realchanges during the workshops began to happen.A Quick Overview of the Brain Scans UsedI want to introduce you to two types of brain-scan readings so that you can seeand understand the changes I’m about to show you. Let’s make it simple. Thefirst type of scan we used measures degrees of activity between brain areas (seeFigure 10.2, located along with the rest of the figures for this chapter in thefull-color insert pages). The scans map two relative types of this activity.Hyperactivity (or overregulation) is depicted by red lines connecting differentlocations in the brain. Imagine telephone lines connecting one place to anotherin order to establish communication between those areas. Having too many redlines at any one time indicates too much action taking place within the brain.Hypoactivity (lack of regulation) is depicted by blue lines indicating thatminimal information is being communicated between the different brain areas.The thickness of the lines represents the standard deviation, or how muchdysregulation (or abnormal regulation) exists between the two locations the lineconnects. For example, the thin red lines indicate that the level of activitybetween those locations is 1.96 standard deviations (SD) above normal. The thinblue lines indicate that the level of activity between those locations is 1.96SD below normal. The medium lines indicate 2.58 SD either above (red) or below(blue) normal. And the thick lines indicate 3.09 SD above or below normal. Sowhen you see a lot of thick red lines in a scan, it means the brain is workingtoo hard. When you see a lot of thick blue lines, it suggests there’s littlecommunication between different areas of the brain and, therefore, the brain isunderactive. Think of it like this: The thicker the red line, the higher thevolume of data the brain is processing, and the thicker the blue line, the lowerthe volume of data the brain processing.The second type of scan we used comes from the QEEG analysis and is called aZ-Score report. Z-Score is a statistical measure that tells us not only whethera point is above or below average, but also how far from normal the measurementis. The scale on this report ranges from -3 to +3 SD. The darker blue represents3 or more SD below normal, while the lighter blues range from about 2.5 to 1 SDbelow normal. Blue-green is approximately 0 to 1 SD below normal, while green isbaseline normal. Light green registers at the outer area of normal but isconsidered from 0 to 1 SD above normal, while yellow and light orange areapproximately 1 to 2 SD above normal, darker orange is about 2 to 2.5 SD abovenormal, and red is 3 or more SD above normal. (See Figure 10.3.)The Z-Score report that will be used is called relative power, and it showsinformation about the amount of energy in the brain at different frequencies.Because green, as explained previously, indicates the normal range, the moregreen there is in a scan, the more the person is conforming to normal brain-waveactivity. Each colored circle (resembling a person’s head when viewed from thetop)represents what one person’s brain is doing at each brain-wave frequency.The circle in the upper-left region of each scan shows the lowest brain-wavefrequency (in delta brain waves), and each circle after that depicts a higherand higher brain-wave state, moving progressively up to the highest beta brainwaves at the bottom-right region. A cycle per second in brain-wave frequency isknown as hertz, or Hz. From left to right and from top to bottom, it progressesfrom 1 to 4 cycles per second (delta) to 4 to 8 cycles per second (theta) to 8to 13 cycles per second (alpha) to 13 to 30-plus cycles per second (lowmid-range and high-range beta). The beta activity can be broken down intodifferent frequency bands, such as 12 to 15 Hz, 15 to 18 Hz, 18 to 25 Hz, and 25to 30 Hz.Therefore, the relative colors in each area show what’s happening in eachdifferent brain-wave state. For example, a lot of blue in a majority of thebrain in 1 cycle per second of delta suggests that there’s little activity ofthe brain in that delta range. And if there’s a lot of red in 14 Hz alpha in thefrontal lobe, it means that there’s heightened alpha activity in that area ofthe brain.It should also be understood that these measurements could be interpreteddifferently depending on what the subject is doing when the scan is taken. Forexample, if 1 Hz delta were depicted in blue, that would suggest that the energyin the brain at that frequency is 3 SD below normal. In a clinical sense, thatmight be interpreted as being abnormally low. But because it was recorded whenthe subject was meditating, such a scan would actually suggest that the 1 Hzdelta had opened the door to a stronger connection to the collective consciousenergy field. In other words, as the energy in the neocortex is turned way down,the autonomic nervous system is more readily accessed. In just a bit, you’ll seeseveral examples that will make all of this clear. In the meantime, glance atFigure 10.3 again. It will give you an overview to illustrate what I’ve justexplained.Coherence vs. IncoherenceNow look at Figure 10.4. The image to the left (labeled “before meditation”)represents a brain that has a lot of chatter. It’s functioning in a high levelof arousal (high-range beta) and is quite incoherent. The thickness of the redlines shows that this brain is 3 SD above normal (because the thicker the redline, the more revved up and imbalanced the brain is). By looking at the redlines, you can see excessive incoherent activity happening throughout the entirebrain. The blue in the front of the brain represents hypoactivity (2 to 3 SDbelow normal) in the frontal lobes, showing that the frontal lobes are shut downor turned off and so aren’t restraining the hyperactivity in the rest of thebrain.This is a brain with attention problems; it’s so overloaded that it has noleader to control the chatter. It’s like a TV satellite system with 50 channelswhere the volume is turned up really loud and the channels are changing everysecond. Too many quick shifts in attention span occur from one thought processto the next, so the brain is overly vigilant, highly aroused, overworked, andoverregulated. We call this an incoherent brain pattern, because the differentparts of the brain are not working together at all.Now take a look at the second image (labeled “after meditation”). You don’t haveto be a neuroscientist to see the difference between the first image and thisone. Here, you see hardly any red or blue lines, demonstrating normal brainactivity—with very little hyperactivity or hypoactivity. The chatter hasstopped, and the brain is working more holistically. This person’s brain is nowin balance, so we can say that this brain demonstrates a more coherent pattern.(The remaining activity in blue and red, as indicated by the arrow, representssensory-motor activity, which probably means the person is twitching or blinkingand in a state of rapid eye movement, or REM, which typically happens in verylight sleep.) This change took place in one of the students after only onemeditation.Now let’s explore some more case studies of students from the workshops. Foreach, I’ll first give you a bit of background so that you can see what state ofbeing students were in when they began the workshop, then I’ll explain whattheir scans showed, and finally I’ll describe the new state of being eachstudent created.Healing Parkinson’s Disease Without a Placebo or DrugMichelle’s old self: Michelle is in her 60s and was diagnosed with Parkinson’sdisease in 2011, after she noticed progressive involuntary shaking of her leftarm, left hand, and left foot. In November 2012, she became a patient at BarrowNeurological Institute in Phoenix. Her attending physician told her that she’dprobably had Parkinson’s for 10 to 15 years already and that she’d have to livewith the symptoms. Her plan was to cope with the progression of the bodilylimitations as she aged. She began taking Azilect (rasagiline mesylate), amedication used for Parkinson’s disease that stops the uptake of dopamine at thereceptor-site level, slowing its breakdown in the body. The drug produced veryfew noticeable changes.Michelle became a student in November 2012. The month of December wasoutstanding. Her daily meditation routine brought a feeling of peace and joy,which began to reduce her symptoms to a noticeable degree. Michelle was certainthat this course of action would assist her in overcoming Parkinson’s.She continued experiencing great meditation sessions through early February2013. In mid-February, however, Michelle’s mother was admitted to intensive carein Sarasota, Florida, so Michelle flew to Florida to be with her. The dayMichelle flew back to Arizona for our February 2013 workshop, her mother wasplaced in hospice care. Michelle’s plane landed in Phoenix about an hour and ahalf before her first brain scan. Needless to say, she was both physically andemotionally exhausted at the time of the brain scan, which indeed showed theextreme stress she was experiencing.By the end of that workshop, she was certainly in a calmer, more positive stateof being, with barely noticeable Parkinson’s symptoms. Following the workshop,Michelle returned to Florida to be with her mother again. Although she and hermother always had a difficult relationship, as a result of her efforts in theworkshop, Michelle felt sufficiently strengthened to be supportive, loving, andtotally free of any old issues that could have interfered with the love she feltfor her mother.Nevertheless, because of her mother’s illness and eventual passing, as well asher sister in Texas having a major stroke, Michelle was forced to fly back andforth to Florida and Texas to deal with her family challenges. Her routine wasgreatly affected, and by June, she stopped doing her meditations. Life hadgotten in the way, and she had too many responsibilities. Stopping hermeditations was like stopping taking the placebo. When she noticed her symptomsreturning, she started meditating again and made significant strides.Michelle’s scans: Because Michelle lives close to Dr. Fannin’s clinic inArizona, we were able to track her progress for more than five months, by takinga series of six periodic brain scans. I want to explain her evolution duringthat time.Take a look at the “before meditation” part of Figure 10.5. This is her scan atthe February 2013 event after she came home from Florida, stressed and exhaustedfrom her mother’s illness. The thick red lines indicate her brain in all areasis 3 SD from normal. She’s displaying too much brain activity, hyperincoherence,and overregulation. In Parkinson’s disease, this is quite common. The lack ofthe proper neurotransmitters (specifically dopamine) causes the neurons todisplay an erratic communication system between each region of the brain, withneural networks firing out of control. The result is a type of spastic orhyperactive neuronal firing, which affects the brain and the body. As a result,involuntary motor functions interfere with normal movement.Now review the “after meditation” part of the same figure. This is Michelle’sbrain after four days of changing her state of being during meditation. This isvery close to a normal brain, with very little hyperactivity, incoherence, oroverregulation. At the end of our event, she was experiencing no involuntarytremors, twitches, or motor problems—and her brain scan confirms this change.Now let’s look at the QEEG readings in Figure 10.6A, labeled “beforemeditation.” If you look from the middle of the second row all the way to thelast row—the images in blue—you’ll see that Michelle’s brain is showing no alphaor beta brain-wave functioning. Remember that blue means cooled-off brainactivity. With Parkinson’s, this is typically represented by lessened cognitiveactivity, compromised learning, and a loss of engagement. Here, you can see thatMichelle can’t consolidate new information. She has no ability to sustain aninternal picture, because she’s not producing alpha brain waves. Her verylow-range beta patterns also show that she is having difficulty with sustaininglevels of awareness. All of the energy in her brain is going toward dealing withher hyperincoherence, so it’s like a lightbulb going from 50 watts to 10 watts.The volume of energy in the brain is turned down.If you look at the “after-meditation” part of the graphic, you’ll see what lookslike a much-improved and balanced brain. All of those green areas in most of theimages indicated with arrows represent normal and balanced brain activity. Herbrain can now function in alpha, and she can move into internal states moreeasily, cope with stress better, and enter into the subconscious operatingsystem to influence autonomic functions. Even her beta activity returned back tonormal (green), indicating that she is more conscious, alert, and attentive. Thebalanced activity resulted in very few motor problems.The red areas circled at the bottom in higher-range beta signify anxiety. Thisis the attitude that Michelle struggles with and is working on changing from aninternal perspective. Coincidentally, anxiety is exactly what has amplified herParkinson’s symptoms in the past. As she lowers her anxiety, she lowers thesymptoms of Parkinson’s. To Michelle, her tremors now represent when she’s outof balance in her life. When she regulates her internal states, she produceschanges in her external reality.Three months later, Michelle again had her brain scanned at Dr. Fannin’s office.The May 9, 2013, scan in Figure 10.6B still shows her brain improving, which isexactly what Michelle reported. She’s still getting better in the midst of allof the different stresses in her life. Because she does her meditations everyday (think of it as taking her placebo daily), Michelle is continually changingher brain and body to be greater than the conditions in her environment. Thescan shows that she’s dropped almost another standard deviation from herprevious scan at the bottom of the graph. You can clearly see that her anxietyis still getting better, and as a result, so is her condition. Less anxietymeans fewer tremors. She’s sustaining and thus memorizing that state of beingfor a longer period of time—and her brain is showing the changes.If you look at Michelle’s brain scan from June 3, 2013, in Figure 10.6C, you’llsee a slight regression of her progress—although she’s still better than whenshe started. Here, she’d stopped doing her meditation (and therefore stoppedtaking the placebo), so her brain slightly regressed to what it knew before. Thebrain with the arrow at the blue area of 13 Hz means she’s hypoactive in thesensory-motor area and, thus, has less ability to control her involuntarytremors. In this brain-wave pattern, Michelle has less energy to control herbody. You can also see the red areas circled again in the bottom of the scanreturning in higher-range beta, which correlate with her anxiety.By her June 27, 2013, scan shown in Figure 10.6D, Michelle had gone back to hermeditations at the beginning of that month, and her brain scan showed asignificantly better brain. She had less overall anxiety, as demonstrated in redat the bottom row at 17 to 20 Hz. Now compare that scan to her next one, on July13, 2013, after our workshop, as depicted in Figure 10.6E. There’s even lessred, and the blue that showed up in her first scan in February during alpha(indicating hypoactivity) is completely gone. Michelle continues to improve, andher changes are becoming more consistent.Michelle’s new self: Today, Michelle hardly ever has any of the involuntarymotor symptoms associated with Parkinson’s disease. Very minor twitches dopresent themselves when she gets stressed or overtired at times, but for themost part, she’s high functioning and normal. When Michelle is balanced andjoyful, doing her meditations daily, her brain is working well—and so is she.From both our continued scans and her own reports, Michelle isn’t merelymaintaining her condition; she continues to get better and better. She keepsmeditating, because she understands that she has to be the placebo every day.Changing Traumatic Brain and Spinal-Cord Injury by Thought AloneJohn’s old self: In November 2006, John broke his neck at the seventh cervicaland first thoracic vertebrae while he was a passenger in a car that spun out ofcontrol and rolled at high speed. Due to the impact, he suffered a severe headinjury as well. The doctors were quick and sure about his prognosis. He would bea quadriplegic for the rest of his life. He would never walk again and wouldhave very limited use of his arms and hands. His vertebrae were 100 percentdislocated, resulting in spinal-cord damage. It wasn’t until John had surgerythat his doctors saw the exact extent of his injuries. Two days later, theneurologist told John’s wife that his spinal cord was somewhat “intact” but thathis type of injury could have the same outcome as a complete cord severing. Itwould be, as with all spinal-cord injuries, a waiting game.When you’re caught up in the day-to-day reality of living in the intensive careunit, and later a rehab center, it can be extremely difficult not to get sweptaway by conventional thinking. When John and his family asked about his possiblerecovery, the doctors said that given the injury and the lack of return to anykind of normal functioning up to that point, they should begin accepting theinevitable. John would be physically handicapped for the rest of his life. Hisdoctors hammered this message home over and over, as a necessary part of “movingon.” But somehow, both John and his wife couldn’t accept it.I met John while he was in his wheelchair in 2009, along with his wife andfamily and an amazing physical therapist who understands neuroplasticity. Theyare some of the most energetic and optimistic people I’ve ever met, and weeagerly began our journey together.John’s scans: Take a look at John’s “before meditation” brain scan in Figure10.7. His first picture demonstrates quite a bit of hypoactivity. It’s more than3 SD below normal. John’s coherence measurement, with such significant thickblue lines, is the opposite of our study of Michelle’s Parkinson’s condition,which showed thick red lines. This scan reveals a diminished capacity fordifferent parts of the brain working well together. His brain here is on idleand has no energy, and he has limited ability to respond to anything for anylength of time. He couldn’t sustain attention, and his awareness was limited.Because of his traumatic brain injury, his brain was in a state of super-lowarousal, and it showed a high degree of incoherence.Now look at his brain scan after four days of meditation. In the first image onthe upper-left margin at 1 Hz delta, he has some more activity demonstrated inred. In this case, it’s a good sign, because more coherence is happening indelta in both hemispheres. Here, John is starting to show more balanceddual-brain processing. Because his traumatic brain injury is most visible indelta and theta, the hyperactivity in delta suggests that his brain is wakingup. The rest of his brain in alpha and beta is showing more balanced activityand better cognitive function. This shows he has more access to control his mindand body.Now view Figure 10.8. The blue color starting from about the middle of thesecond row until the end of the bottom row once again indicates that John has noalpha or beta brain waves. This blue color distributed throughout the alpha andbeta realms in the left and right hemispheres suggests that he’s vegetating andworking on limited resources. The blue shows less cognitive ability and lesscapacity to control his body. John’s mind is just not there.After four days of meditation, 90 percent of John’s brain has returned back tonormal, as shown by all the green. That’s pretty good! He still has somehypoactivity in his left hemisphere, where the arrows are pointing, indicatingsome problems with verbal skills and expressing himself, but it’s still so muchbetter than his first scan. John continues to do his meditations, and his braincontinues to show more energy, more balance, and more coherence. John hasregained access to the latent neuropathways that were there before. His brainwoke up, remembered how to work again, and now has the energy to work better.John’s new self: John stood up at the end of our February 2013 event. He hasregained full control of his bowels and his bladder. To date, he is now standingin a more normal and integrated posture. His movements are more coordinated. Thefrequency, intensity, and duration of his spastic tremors have diminishedconsiderably. He’s even doing a total gym workout on a regular basis, thanks tothe help of his amazing therapist, B. Jill Runnion (director of Synapse—Centerfor Neuro Re-Activation in Driggs, Idaho), who also studies my work and has theskills and unlimited mind to challenge John by setting up the right conditions.His unassisted vertical-squat exercises have progressed from a 10-degree angleto a 45-degree angle.John is now in complete control of lowering his body to a seated position. Hecan also perform a specific physical therapy exercise that involves loading hisleg and torso muscles and pushing a sled away from his body with resistance.John is now going from lying facedown to supporting himself on all fours,completely under his own power, and he’s now starting to crawl.Just months after the workshop, John astounded his medical team with all of hisimprovements in cognitive functioning. His advances exceeded anything any of thespecialists had ever seen in a spinal-cord-injury patient. It was as if Johnfinally woke up, and his scans show that he now has more access to his brain andbody. John is still demonstrating more control over dormant areas of his brainand body, because he now has more capacity to regulate his body.John’s overall integration and coordinated movement patterns progressedconsiderably, enabling him to sit up at a table unassisted, with his feetplanted on the floor. John’s fine motor skills improved to the point where hecan now hold a pen and sign his name, use a smartphone to send a text message,grip the steering wheel to drive, and hold a regular toothbrush. His cognitivechanges demonstrate more self-confidence and greater inner joy. He has a muchgreater sense of humor and is more aware than ever.During the summer of 2013, John was able to go on a white-water rafting trip,where he held himself unassisted in a raft for six hours a day and slept in atent on the ground. He managed to live in the Idaho wilderness, away fromcontact with the outside world, for seven days and six nights. He couldn’t havedone this a year ago. Every time John and I talk, he always says the same thing:“Dr. Joe, I have no idea what’s happening.”I always give him the same response: “The moment you know what’s happening,John, it’s all over. The unknown is beyond our comprehension. Welcome it.”I’d like to make one final point about John’s case. Everyone knows that aspinal-cord injury doesn’t heal with typical conventional approaches. I’m surethat it’s not matter that’s changing matter for John. That is, it’s notchemistry or molecules that are altering his damaged spinal cord. From a quantumperspective, he’d have to be in a coherent frequency of heightened energy thatwould have to consistently lift or entrain matter to a new mind. He’d have todisplay an elevated energy or wave that vibrates at a frequency faster thanmatter, combined with a clear intention, in order to alter the particles ofmatter. So it’s energy, which is the epiphenomenon of matter, that is rewritingthe genetic program and healing his spinal cord.Overcoming the Analytical Mind and Finding JoyKathy’s old self: Kathy is the CEO of a large company, an attorney, and acommitted wife and mother. She has been trained to be highly analytical andrational. She uses her brain every day to anticipate outcomes and to be preparedfor every possible forecasted scenario based on her experience. Before she wasintroduced to my work, she’d never actually meditated. In the beginning, Kathybecame very aware of how much she was analyzing everything in her life. She hada huge daily to-do list and described her brain as never shutting off. Inhindsight, she confesses that she was never in the present moment.Kathy’s scans: Take a look at Kathy’s “before meditation” brain scan in Figure10.9. These delta-to-theta ratio measurements represent her ability to maintainfocus and concentration in order to process and deal with intrusive andextraneous thoughts. The first arrow in the back of her brain on the right side,where the larger red spot is located, shows that she is seeing pictures in hermind. The second arrow, near the smaller red area on the left side, indicatesthat Kathy is internally talking to herself about those pictures. The imageryand constant mind chatter are causing her brain to be stuck in a loop.In the “after meditation” scan, taken at the end of the workshop, you canclearly see that Kathy’s brain is more balanced, more whole, and more normal.She no longer has any brain chatter, because her brain is integrating andprocessing information more efficiently. She’s in a state of coherence. And thechange in her brain state is accompanied by much greater joy, clarity, and love.Now let’s look at her coherence measurements in Figure 10.10. At the beginningof the workshop, Kathy’s brain was in high-range beta, a state of high arousal,high analysis, and high-emergency mode. The thick red lines in alpha and betashow that she’s three SD above normal. Her brain is hyperactive, out of balance,and highly incoherent—and she’s having trouble controlling her anxiety.Now take a look at the “after meditation” scan, taken on the last day of theFebruary event. You should, by now, be able to recognize a more normal andbalanced brain, which has much fewer high-range beta brain waves and far morecoherence.Kathy still had some work to do, so we set up an experiment after the workshop,because she lives in the Phoenix area and could visit Dr. Fannin’s clinic. Dr.Fannin showed her a picture of a healthy, balanced, and normal brain on a QEEGscan (in green) and told her that this was where she needed to focus herattention. He suggested that when she moved into a new state of being every dayin her meditation, she should select that potential outcome for the next 29days. Since she then could assign more meaning to the placebo, she held agreater degree of intention about the benefits of the outcome.It worked. If you look at Figure 10.11, which shows the scan dated April 8,2013, about six weeks later, you’ll see an even more normal brain, with noevidence of anxiety (seen in red). In addition, check out Figure 10.12. Can yousee the progression from February 20, 2013, where Kathy’s brain scan is red inthe higher brain-wave frequencies (21 to 30 Hz), to the end of the Februaryevent, where her brain scan has changed to green in the second image (and so ismuch more normal)? The red areas represented show very high levels of anxiety(high-range beta) and over-analysis because her brain waves in the higherfrequencies (21 to 30 Hz) are hyperactive—her brain was working too hard. By thebeginning of April (shown in Figure 10.13), Kathy’s brain is balanced, coherent,and much more synchronized. Kathy has a much different brain today and reportstruly feeling like a different person.Kathy’s new self: Kathy reports that she has seen numerous positive changes inher career, her daily life, and her relationships. She meditates daily, and whenshe thinks she doesn’t have time to meditate, that’s when she makes sure to findthe time to do it. She understands that the attitude that created herout-of-balance mind and brain is related to time and the conditions in herexternal environment. Kathy says that the answers to her questions come moreeasily and with far less of a struggle. She listens to her heart more often, andshe catches herself before she moves into cycles of vigilance. She rarely getscaught up in those loops, and she finds herself acting in a kinder and morepatient manner. Kathy is happier from the inside out.Healing Fibroid Tumors by Changing EnergyBonnie’s old self: In 2010, Bonnie developed significant pain and excessivebleeding during her menstrual cycle. She was diagnosed with excessive estrogenproduction and was encouraged to begin bioidentical hormones. At age 40, shefound this solution to her diagnosis to be extreme.Bonnie remembered that her mother had had the same symptoms at her age. Hermother had taken hormone pills and eventually died of bladder cancer. Whilethere may be no specific connection between the hormone therapy and bladdercancer, what caught Bonnie’s attention was that she was having the same physicalsymptoms as her mother. She didn’t want to develop the same outcome.Her vaginal bleeding began to last even longer (sometimes up to two weeks), andBonnie became anemic and lethargic, and gained about 20 pounds. She would losean average of two liters of blood each month during her menstrual cycle. Apelvic sonogram confirmed fibroid tumors. Bonnie went through myriad blood testsand was told she was perimenopausal and most likely had an ovarian cyst. Herspecialist who recommended the hormone therapy told Bonnie that fibroids don’tgo away and that the severe bleeding would continue for the rest of her life.I randomly selected Bonnie for one of the extra brain maps during our Englewood,Colorado, event in July 2013; she was mortified when I pointed at her toindicate she was selected for the scan. Bonnie’s menstrual cycle had started theevening before the workshop, and she typically had to wear a large diaper tocapture the amount of blood she lost during her period. When, after severalmeditations, I instructed the students to lie down, Bonnie was concerned thatshe would bleed all over herself and the floor.Because of the extreme pain that accompanied Bonnie’s periods, even sitting wasuncomfortable. Even so, she was determined to continue practicing the meditationtechniques every day for her own peace of mind. During the first meditation inwhich she was being brain mapped, Bonnie had an experience that she can onlydescribe as mystical. She felt her heart open and expand. Her head pushed back,and her breathing changed. Bonnie saw light flood into her body, and sheexperienced a tremendous sense of peace. She also heard the words: “I am loved,blessed, and not forgotten.” Bonnie burst into tears during the meditation, andher brain scan showed that she was in a state of bliss.Bonnie’s scans: Take a look at Bonnie’s EEG scan in Figure 10.14. We were luckyenough to catch the whole experience in real time. The first graphic showsnormal brain-wave activity. Everything is in balance and quiet. If you reviewBonnie’s three scans in Figure 10.15, which capture what was happening to her atdifferent times during her meditation, you can see elevated energy and amplitudein her frontal lobes, which represents her processing quite a bit of informationand emotion. She’s in an expanded state of consciousness and is experiencingpeak moments at different intervals. Most of the activity is happening in thetheta brain waves, and it signifies that she is in her subconscious mind. Theinner experience is very real to her in that moment. She’s so completely focusedon the thought that it becomes the experience. The emotional quotient isrepresented by the amount of energy (amplitude) her brain is processing. Take alook at the vertical length of the lines where the arrows are pointing. That’svery coherent energy. Bonnie is in a heightened state of awareness.Now glance at Figure 10.16. Bonnie’s QEEG scan in real time has an arrowpointing to 1 Hz in delta brain waves, illustrating her connection to thequantum field (shown in blue). Bonnie also has heightened energy in her frontallobe in theta brain waves (demonstrated in red) to match exactly what washappening in her EEG scan. Look at the red circle that is highlighting herfrontal lobes as well as the arrow pointing to a top view of the brain’s frontallobe immediately below. The image you are seeing is a snapshot of a motionpicture of Bonnie’s brain activity during her entire meditation. Because one ofthe functions of the frontal lobe is to make thoughts real, what she isexperiencing in theta with her eyes closed is very real to her. We could saythat Bonnie’s inner experience was like a very vivid, lucid dream. The red arrowat 12 Hz alpha—isolating the red spot in the center of her brain—shows Bonnie’sattempt to make sense of her inner experience and then process what she wasseeing in her mind’s eye. The rest of her brain is healthy and balanced (shownin green).Bonnie’s new self: Bonnie’s experience that day changed her for good. Theamplitude of energy related to the inward experience was greater than any pastexperience from her external environment, and thus her past was biologicallyremoved. The energy of the momentous peak of her meditation superseded thehardwired programs in her brain and the emotional conditioning in the body—andher body instantly responded to a new mind, to a new consciousness. Bonnie hadchanged her state of being. In less than 24 hours, her bleeding stoppedcompletely. She had no symptoms of pain and instinctively knew that she washealed. In the months since the event, Bonnie has experienced only normalmenstrual cycles. She hasn’t had any excessive bleeding or pain since theworkshop.Experiencing EcstasyGenevieve’s old self: Genevieve, a 45-year-old artist and musician, currentlyresides in Holland and travels quite a bit because of her vocation. During theFebruary event, I was watching her brain scan with Dr. Fannin during hermeditation. We started to notice some significant changes in her energy duringthe middle of her inward journey. When we both saw a particular reading on herscan at the same time, we looked at each other, knowing something was about tohappen. Within moments, when we turned to look at her, we saw tears of joyrunning down her face. Genevieve was in ecstasy. She was in utter pleasure, andher body was responding quite readily. We’d never seen anything like thisbefore.Genevieve’s scans: If you look at Figure 10.17, you’ll see a relatively normalbrain scan before Genevieve’s meditation. The areas of green spread throughoutthe brain signify a healthy, well-adjusted woman with a balanced brain. The blueareas of lessened sensory-motor activity before she begins, in alpha 13 to 14Hz, where you see the arrows, probably indicate jetlag, because she’d justarrived from Europe that day. If you observe Genevieve’s brain during themeditation, you see an overall increase in balance. What happens next isoff-the-chart amazing. When we saw her reach this peak moment at the end of hermeditation, we knew from watching her scans that she had quite a bit of energyin her brain.Now take a peek at Figure 10.18. This type of red activity, showing high amountsof energy in all brain-wave range frequencies, suggests that Genevieve is in ahighly altered state. Someone who didn’t know that she was meditating and whojust saw the brain scan would say that she was experiencing an extreme level ofanxiety or psychosis. But because her personal testimonial described her beingin sheer ecstasy, we know that all of the red represents a lot of energy in herbrain. Her brain is at 3 SD above normal. It’s energy, in the form of emotionstored in her body as the mind, that is being released and is traveling back toher brain.Figure 10.19, which shows her EEG reading, validates this position. If youreview the purple lines where the arrow is, you’ll see that this part of thebrain is processing ten times the normal amounts of energy. The area that’scircled in red tells us that the experience is so emotionally profound that it’sbeing stored in Genevieve’s long-term memory. At the same time, she is alsotrying to verbally understand and make sense of what’s happening to her in thatmoment. She might be saying something to herself like, Oh my God! This isamazing. I feel so great! What is this feeling? Her inner experience is as realas any outward event, and she’s not trying to make it happen—it’s just happeningto her. She’s not visualizing; she’s experiencing a profound moment.Interestingly, we scanned Genevieve again in July, at the event in Colorado, andshe still displayed the same energy changes. When we handed her the microphoneduring both events, all she could say was that she was so in love with life thather heart was fully open and that she felt connected to something greater thanherself. She was in a state of grace, and she felt so great that she wanted tostay in the present moment. If you look at Figure 10.20, you’ll see that herbrain had the same patterns and effects at the July event as it had at theFebruary event. The experience was still happening to her months later. She wastruly altered from her personal transformation.Genevieve’s new self: I spoke with Genevieve several weeks after the July event.She told me that she’s not the same person she was at the beginning of the year.Her mind has deepened, and she’s more present and much more creative. She feelsprofound love for all things, and most important, she feels so lifted that sheno longer feels as if she needs or wants anything. She feels whole.Bliss: Moving the Mind Out of the BodyMaria’s old self: Maria is a highly functional woman with normal brain activity.During the first meditation of the day, a 45-minute exercise, she experienced asignificant change in her brain waves within moments.Maria’s scans: Look at Figure 10.21 and notice the difference between Maria’snormal brain waves and her state of ecstasy. I watched her as she went into aheightened state of increased energy, and it appeared as though she were havingan orgasm in her brain. Her scan shows a fully active brain having a full-onkundalini experience (kundalini is a latent energy stored in the body, which,when aroused, brings on higher states of consciousness and energy in the brain).If you look at Maria’s scans, you can see that all areas of her brain wereexperiencing a very heightened energy. When the kundalini energy is awakened, itcan rise from the lower spine to reach the top of the brain, at which point itcan produce an extremely profound mystical experience. Many students in theworkshops have these brain orgasms. In Maria’s scan, all areas of the brain arefully engaged with energy, and her brain waves show three to four times thenormal amplitude. Her brain is coherent and very synchronized. If you look atthe scans, you’ll see that the ecstasy comes in waves, just like an orgasm. Shewas not trying to do any of this. It was actually just happening to her. Herentire brain was engaged in the inner event, and as a result, she was filledwith profound energy.Maria’s new self: Today, Maria continues to have similar mystical experiences.Each time they occur, she reports feeling more relaxed, more conscious, moreaware, and more whole. She welcomes the next unknown moment.Now It’s Your TurnThese few examples (out of many that were documented) prove that it is indeedpossible to teach the placebo effect. Now that you’ve received all of theinformation, stories, and proof of what’s possible, it’s time for you to learnthe “how-to” so that you can experience your own transformation. The next twochapters will outline the steps you can take to begin your personal meditationprocess. It’s my desire for you to put into practice all of the knowledge you’velearned so far so that you experience the truth of your efforts. Once youreceive the tools that you need to cross the river of change, I hope to see youon the other side.image [images/line.jpg]image [images/265.jpg]Figure 10.2image [images/266.jpg]Figure 10.3image [images/267.jpg]Figure 10.4image [images/268.jpg]Figure 10.5image [images/269.jpg]Figure 10.6Aimage [images/270.jpg]Figure 10.6B Figure 10.6Cimage [images/271.jpg]Figure 10.6D Figure 10.6Eimage [images/272.jpg]Figure 10.7image [images/273.jpg]Figure 10.8image [images/274.jpg]Figure 10.9image [images/275.jpg]Figure 10.10image [images/276a.jpg]Figure 10.11image [images/277.jpg]Figure 10.12image [images/278.jpg]Figure 10.13image [images/279a.jpg]Figure 10.14image [images/280.jpg]Figure 10.15Aimage [images/281.jpg]Figure 10.15Bimage [images/282.jpg]Figure 10.15Cimage [images/283.jpg]Figure 10.16image [images/284.jpg]Figure 10.17image [images/285.jpg]Figure 10.18image [images/286.jpg]Figure 10.19image [images/287.jpg]Figure 10.20image [images/288.jpg]Figure 10.21"},{"pageContent":"Part II [toc.html#a15]TRANSFORMATION [toc.html#a15]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Eleven [toc.html#a16]Meditation Preparation [toc.html#a16]Now that you’ve read and absorbed all the information in Part I [p1.html],you’re ready to move to transformation. In this chapter, I’ll go over what youneed to know to get ready to meditate so that when you get to the next chapter,you’ll be ready for me to walk you through the actual meditation. All of theparticipants in this book who changed something about themselves had to first goinward and change their state of being. So think of your meditation practice asa way for you to take the placebo every day. But instead of taking a pill,you’ll be going inward. In time, your meditation will become like your belief intaking medication.When to MeditateThere are two times a day that are the most conducive to meditation: rightbefore you go to bed at night and right after you get up in the morning. That’sbecause when you fall asleep, you naturally shift though the entire spectrum ofbrain-wave states, going from your waking, beta state to the slower alpha state,when you close your eyes, to the slower-still theta state, when you’rehalf-asleep and half-awake, all the way down to the deep-sleep delta brain-wavestate. And when you wake up in the morning, you do the same thing in reverse:rising from delta to theta to alpha to beta, where you’re fully awake andconscious.So if you meditate when you’re getting ready for sleep or just coming out ofsleep, it’s easier to slip into alpha or theta brain waves; you’re more primedfor being in an altered state, because it’s the direction you either have justcome from or are slipping into. You could say that the door to the subconsciousmind is open during these two times. I personally prefer to meditate in themorning, but either time is fine. Pick what will work best for you, and thenstick with it. If you can meditate every day, it will become a good habit andwill be something you look forward to doing daily.Where to MeditateThe most important consideration in selecting a place to meditate is to choose aplace where you won’t be distracted. Because you’ll be unplugging from theexternal, physical world, pick a quiet place where you can be alone anduninterrupted (either by other people or by pets)—a place that you can return toevery day and use as your regular, sacred meditation spot.I don’t recommend that you meditate in bed, because you associate bed withsleep. (For the same reason, I don’t recommend that you lie down or use arecliner when you meditate.) Pick a chair to sit in, or arrange a spot on thefloor where you’ll be able to sit for up to an hour—a spot away from any draftsand in a room where the temperature is comfortable.If you prefer to meditate to music, choose soft, relaxing, trance-inducinginstrumentals or chants without lyrics. (In fact, a little music works well tocover background noise if you aren’t in an environment that’s completely quiet.)Definitely don’t play music that brings up associative memories of some pastevent or that would be distracting in any way. Also, be sure to turn off yourcomputer and your phone if they’re in the room. And try to avoid the aroma ofcoffee brewing or food cooking. You may even want to use a blindfold or earplugsto enhance the effect of sensory deprivation, since the goal in your preparationis to eliminate as much external stimuli as possible.Making Your Body ComfortableDress in comfortable, loose clothing and remove your watch or any jewelry thatmight be distracting. If you wear glasses, take them off, too. Drink a littlewater before you sit down, and have a glass within reach in case you need it.Use the bathroom before you begin, and try to take care of any similar issues sothat you won’t be distracted during your meditation.Whether you’re sitting in a chair or on the floor cross-legged, sit up straightand keep your spine erect. Your body should be relaxed, but your mind needs tostay focused, so don’t be so relaxed that you fall asleep. If your head beginsto nod during meditation, it’s a sign that you’re moving into a slowerbrain-wave state, so don’t worry too much about that. With some practice, yourbody will become conditioned and won’t want to doze off.As you begin the meditation, close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths.Soon you should drop from a beta brain-wave state into an alpha state. This morerestful, but still focused, state activates your frontal lobe, which as youread, lowers the volume on the circuits in your brain that process time andspace. Although at first you might not be able to slip easily into the nextslower brain-wave state, theta, with practice you’ll be able to slow your brainwaves down even further. Theta is the brain-wave state where the body is asleepbut the mind is awake, and it’s where you can more readily change your body’sautomatic programs.How Long to MeditateWhile your meditation will generally last between 45 minutes and an hour, allowyourself plenty of time, if possible, to settle your mind before you begin. Ifyou need to finish by a certain time, set an alarm to go off ten minutes beforeyou have to end the meditation, to give you an opportunity to finish the sessionwithout having to come to an abrupt stop. Don’t let time be a distractionthough. Remember, just as you’re getting away from sensory input, you’re alsogetting away from being conscious of time, so if you’re constantly worried aboutwhat time it is, you’ll be completely defeating your purpose. If you need a fewmore minutes in your day to be able to meditate without this distraction,consider waking up earlier or going to bed later.Mastering Your WillI want to warn you about a very common stumbling block for people who arestarting a meditation practice. Any time you start to change something in yourlife, your body, as the mind, will signal your brain to be in control again. Thenext thing you know, you might start to hear negative voices in your head like,Why don’t you start tomorrow? You’re too much like your mother! What’s wrongwith you? You’ll never change. This doesn’t feel right. That’s the body tryingto unseat you so that it can be the mind again. You may have unconsciouslyconditioned it to be impatient, frustrated, unhappy, victimized, or pessimistic,to name a few examples. So that’s how it wants to subconsciously behave.The moment you respond to that voice as if what it’s saying is true, yourconsciousness immerses itself back into the automated program, so you return tothinking the same thoughts, performing the same actions, and living by the sameemotions—but still expecting something to change in your life. If you usefeelings and emotions as a barometer for change, you’ll always talk yourself outof possibility. When you instead free the body of the chains of these emotions,you are then able to relax into the present moment (more on that later in thischapter), and you’ll be liberating energy from the body—going from particle towave—so that it becomes available to create new destiny. To get to that place,to teach your body a new way of being, you have to sit your body down and let itknow who the master is.We have a ranch with 18 horses, and mastering the will to stay focused inmeditation reminds me of what it’s like to ride a favorite stallion after Ihaven’t been on him in a while. When I first climb up into the saddle, thatstallion couldn’t care less about me. He smells the mares on the other side ofthe property, and that’s where his attention goes. It’s as though he’s saying tome, “Where have you been for the last eight months? I got into some bad habitswhile you were away, the girls are over there, and I’m not concerned about whatyou want to do, so I’m going to throw you off. I’m in charge here.” He gets mad,temperamental, and controlling, and he tries to run me into the side of thearena. But I pay attention to him, and when his head starts to turn toward thosemares, I take control of him.So the moment I see him start to move away from my lead, I slowly but firmlygrab the reins and pull them in, and I just wait. And before long, he stops andlets out this big snort, and I stroke him on the side and tell him, “That’sright.” And we take two steps and then I see his head starting to turn justslightly again, and I stop him—and wait. And he lets out another big snort, andonce he knows I’m in charge, we start to move forward again. I just keepfollowing the same procedure until he ultimately surrenders to me.That kind of gentle but firm refocusing is exactly the same approach to use withyour body when you sit down to meditate. Think of your body as the animal thatyou, as consciousness, are training. Every time you become conscious that yourattention has wandered and you bring it back like that, you’re reconditioningyour body to a new mind. You are mastering yourself and your past.So let’s say you wake up in the morning and have a list of people to call, alist of errands to run, 35 texts to respond to, and all these e-mails to answer.If the first thing you do every morning is start thinking about all of thosethings that you have to do, your body is already in the future. When you sitdown to meditate, your mind may naturally want to go in that direction. And ifyou allowed it, then your brain and body would be in that same predictablefuture, because you’d be anticipating an outcome based on your same pastexperience from yesterday.So the moment you start to notice your mind wanting to go in that direction, youjust pull the reins in, settle your body down, and bring it back to the presentmoment—just as I do when I ride my stallion. And then, in the next moment, ifyou start thinking, Yeah, but you have to do this, you forgot about that, andyou need to do the thing you didn’t get to yesterday, just bring your mind backto the present moment again. And if it keeps happening and that brings up theemotions of frustration, impatience, worry, and so on, just remember thatwhatever emotion you’re experiencing is merely part of the past. So you justnotice it; you become aware: Ah, my body-mind wants to go to the past. Allright. Let’s settle down and relax back into the present.Just as your mind will try to distract you, your body may do the same. It maywant to get nauseated, create pain, or make that spot in the middle of your backitch, but if that happens, remember that it’s just the body trying to be themind. So as you master it, you are becoming greater than your body. If you canmaster it during your meditation each time, then when you walk back into yourlife, you’re going to be more present, more aware, and more conscious—and lessunconscious.Sooner or later, just as my stallion surrenders to me and follows my commandswithout letting the mares or anything else distract him, your body will alsoacquiesce to your mind during your meditation without getting hijacked by anystray thoughts. And when the horse and rider are one, when the mind and body areworking together, there’s simply no greater feeling—you’re in a new state ofbeing. It’s incredibly empowering.Moving into an Altered StateThe meditation I’m going to walk you through in the next chapter begins with atechnique the Buddhists call open focus. It’s very helpful for getting into thealtered state we’re trying to achieve, because in our normal day-to-dayexistence, living in survival mode and marinating in stress hormones, we’renaturally very narrow focused. We put all our attention on things and people andproblems (focusing on the particle or matter, not on the wave or energy), and wedefine reality by our senses. We can call that type of attention objectfocused.1 [endnote.html#fni-1]With all our attention on the outer world, which in this state appears more realto us than the inner world, our brains pretty much stay in a higher-range betabrain-wave state—the most reactive, unstable, and volatile of all the differentbrain-wave patterns. Because we’re on high alert, we aren’t in a position tocreate, daydream, solve problems, learn new things, or heal. It’s certainly nota state that’s conducive to meditating. The electrical activity in our brainsincreases, and thanks to the fight-or-flight response, our heart rate andrespiration naturally increase. Our bodies can’t spend much, if any, of theirresources for growth and optimal health, because they’re always on thedefensive, trying to protect us, just trying to help us make it through the day.Under these less-than-favorable conditions, our brains tend to compartmentalize,meaning that some regions of the brain begin to work separately from the othersinstead of working together, and some even work in opposition to each other—likestepping on the brake and the gas at the same time. It’s a house divided againstitself.In addition to the parts of the brain not communicating well with each other,the brain no longer communicates with the rest of the body in an efficient,orderly manner. Because the brain and the central nervous system control andcoordinate all the other systems of our bodies—keeping our hearts beating andour lungs breathing, digesting food and eliminating waste, controlling ourmetabolism, regulating the immune system, balancing our hormones, and keepingcountless other functions working—we become unbalanced. Our brains send verydisorderly messages and “dis-integrated” signals down the spinal cord to therest of the body. As a result, none of the body’s systems gets a clear message.Instead, the message is very incoherent.Picture the immune system responding, “I don’t know how to make a white bloodcell out of that instruction.” And then picture the digestive system saying, “Ican’t tell if I should secrete acid in my stomach first or if I should secreteit in my small intestine. These orders are pretty mixed up.”At the same time, the cardiovascular system laments, “I can’t tell if my heartshould be in rhythm or out of rhythm, because the signal I’m getting is prettyout of rhythm itself. Is there really a lion around the corner again?”This state of imbalance keeps us out of homeostasis or equilibrium, and it’seasy to see then how it sets us up for disease, producing arrhythmias or highblood pressure (unbalanced cardiovascular system); indigestion and acid reflux(unbalanced digestive system); and a preponderance of colds, allergies, cancer,rheumatoid arthritis, and other conditions (unbalanced immune function)—to namejust a few examples.That state—with our brain waves becoming scrambled and filled with static—iswhat I referred to in the last chapter as a state of incoherence. There’s norhythm or order to our brain waves or to the messages the brain sends thebody—it’s total cacophony.In the open-focus technique, on the other hand, we close our eyes, take ourattention off the outer world and its trappings, and instead open our focus topay attention to the space around us (on the wave instead of the particle). Thereason it works is that when we’re sensing this space, we’re not giving ourattention to anything material and we’re not thinking. Our brain-wave patternsshift to the more restful and creative alpha (and eventually theta as well). Inthis state, our inner world now becomes more real to us than the outer world,which means we’re in a much better position to make the changes we want to make.Research shows that when we use the open-focus technique properly, the brainstarts to become more organized and more synchronized, with the differentcompartments working together in a more orderly fashion. And what syncs togetherlinks together. In this level of coherence, the brain can now send more coherentsignals throughout the entire nervous system to the rest of the body, andeverything starts to move in rhythm, working together. Instead of cacophony, nowour brains and our bodies are playing a beautiful symphony. The end result isthat we feel more whole, integrated, and balanced. My colleagues and I saw thistype of consistent brain changes in the majority of the students we scanned inour workshops, so we know this technique works.The Sweet Spot of the Present MomentAfter walking you through open focus, the meditation you’ll do will move youinto the practice of finding the present moment. Being present gives us accessto possibilities on the quantum level that we didn’t have access to before.Remember how I said that in the quantum field, the subatomic particles existsimultaneously in an infinite array of possibilities? In order for that to betrue, the quantum universe can’t have only one line of time. It must have aninfinite number of timelines, simultaneously containing all of thesepossibilities stacked on top of one another. In fact, every experience—past,present, and future—of every single thing from the smallest microorganism to themost advanced culture in the universe exists within the field of unlimitedinformation called the “quantum field.” I said the quantum world has no time,but the truth is that it has all time simultaneously—it just doesn’t have lineartime, which is the way we usually think of time.As the quantum model of reality says, all possibilities exist in the presentmoment. But if you’re waking up every morning and doing the same sequence ofevents—making the same choices that lead to the same behaviors that create thesame experiences that produce the same emotional payoff—then you aren’t open toany of those other possibilities and you aren’t going anywhere new.Take a look at Figure 11.1. The circle represents you in the present moment on aparticular line of time. The line to the left of that represents your past, andthe line to the right represents your future. Let’s say that every day, you wakeup, go to the bathroom, brush your teeth, take the dog out, drink your coffee ortea, have the same breakfast, get dressed in the same routine way, drive to workalong a familiar route, and so on. Each of these events is represented by apoint on the timeline of your immediate future.image [images/276.jpg]Each dot on the timeline represents the same thought, choice, behavior,experience, and emotion from past days, weeks, months, and even years.Therefore, the past becomes the future. Since a habit is a redundant set ofautomatic thoughts, actions, and feelings that is acquired through frequentrepetition—that is, when the body becomes the mind—then for most, our bodies arealready programmed to be in the same predictable future based on our state ofbeing from the past. And if we memorize emotions that keep us connected to thepast, and those feelings drive our thoughts, then our bodies are literallyliving in the past. We are rarely in the present moment.So let’s say you’ve gone through pretty much that same sequence every day forten years. Your body is then already programmed by habit to be in the future,based on your past, because as you emotionally begin to anticipate each of thoseevents on your timeline, your body (as the unconscious mind) believes it’s inthat same predictable reality. And the same emotion signals the same genes inthe same way, and now you’re in that predictable future line of time. In fact,you could take that timeline from your past and just lift it up and set it intoyour future, because in this scenario, your past is your future. You’re like thepiano players who installed the circuitry in their brains just by thinking aboutplaying the same sequence of keys over and over again and like the fingerexercisers who changed their bodies by thought alone; you’re priming your brainand conditioning your body into the same future as you mentally rehearse thesame predictable daily scenario in your mind from yesterday.We can never find the present moment, because our brains and bodies are alreadyliving in a known future reality based on the past. Now take a look at all ofthose points on your timeline that represent the choices, habits, actions, andexperiences that create the same emotions in order to remind you of the feelingof you. There’s no room for something new or unknown, something uncommon ormiraculous, to show up in your life, because those points are so closely knittogether. It would be too inconvenient, and frankly, it would disrupt yourroutine. How upsetting it would be for something new to show up in the life of apersonality that’s unconsciously anticipating the future based on the past!I should warn you here that when you begin a meditation practice, if you justinsert your meditation as another event on your timeline, there’s a danger thatyou’ll merely be adding another item to your to-do list. And if that’s how youapproach it, you still won’t be able to find the present moment. To accomplishwhat you’re after here, healing and making lasting changes, you have to be fullyin the present moment, not thinking about what the next predictable event is onyour timeline.That’s true because wherever you place your attention is where you’re placingyour energy. So if you’re paying even the smallest bit of attention to things,people, places, or events in your external environment, then you’re reaffirmingthat reality. And if you’re in the habit of obsessing about time—thinking abouteither the past (the known) or the future, which is based on your past (and sois also the known)—then you’re missing the present moment, where all possibilityexists. When you focus on the known, you, as the quantum observer, can only getmore of exactly that. You’ll be collapsing all those possibilities in thequantum field into the same patterns of information called your life.In order to access the unlimited potential that’s waiting for you in the quantumfield, you have to forget about the known (your body, your face, your gender,your race, your profession, and even your concept of what you have to do today)so that you can remain for a while in the unknown—where you are no body, no one,no thing, and in no place and in no time. You have to become pure consciousness(nothing but a thought or an awareness that you’re aware in a void ofpotentials) so that your brain can recalibrate.And when the body wants to distract you, but you keep mastering it and settlingit back into the present moment over and over again until it acquiesces, the wayyou read about earlier, then that line that goes into the future no longerexists because the body is no longer living in that predictable destiny. You’vedisconnected from it or unplugged your energy circuits from it.Similarly, if your body is conditioned and addicted to emotions you’ve memorizedthat keep you connected to the past, but you manage to bring your body back andsettle it down every time you feel angry or frustrated until your body finallysurrenders into the present moment, then that line that goes into that past nolonger exists either. You’ve unplugged from that line, too. And when both yourpast and your future lines disappear, your predictable genetic destiny vanishesas well.In this moment, there’s no longer any past to drive the future, and there’s nolonger any predictable future based on the past. You’re solely in the present,where you have access to all those potentials and possibilities. And the longeryou’re invested in the unknown by unplugging from those timelines and lingeringin those possibilities, the more energy you liberate from your body and makeavailable for creating something new. Figure 11.2 demonstrates how the past andthe future no longer exist when the brain and the body are totally in thepresent moment. The predictable reality of knowns does not exist, thereforeyou’re in the unknown realm of possibilities.image [images/279.jpg]When you find the sweet spot of the present moment and you forget about yourselfas the same personality, you have access to other possibilities that alreadyexist in the quantum field. That’s because you are no longer connected to thesame body-mind, to the same identification with the environment, and to the samepredictable timeline. In the moment, the same familiar past and future literallyno longer exist, and you become pure consciousness—a thought alone. That is themoment that you can change your body, change something in your environment, andcreate a new timeline.The meditation outlined in the next chapter includes a period where you get tolinger in this potent unknown, in the blackness of possibility, and invest yourenergy into the void of potentials that exist in the present moment. Rememberthat even though it may look as if there’s nothing there, it really isn’t justempty blackness; it’s the quantum field, and it’s just bursting with energy andpossibility.When my colleagues and I examined our advanced-workshop students who were ableto become pure consciousness—a thought separate from this known reality—we sawthe greatest strides in their ability to change their brains, their bodies, andtheir lives. If the placebo is about changing the body by thought alone, then avery important step is to become a thought—alone.Seeing Without EyesHere’s one of my favorite examples of what can happen when you focus on theunknown in meditation. Not long ago, I was doing a workshop in Sydney,Australia, in which I was leading a meditation where I’d asked the participantsto be no body, no one, no thing, and to be in no place and in no time—to becomepure consciousness, lingering in the unknown (just as you’re about to do in thenext chapter).As I was watching the group meditate, I happened to notice a woman, namedSophia, sitting in the third row, meditating with her eyes closed, just likeeveryone else. And all of a sudden, I saw her energy change. Something just toldme to wave to her, so I did, and still with her eyes closed, Sophia waved back!I motioned for two of my trainers who were at the other end of the room to comeover. When they got to me, I pointed directly at Sophia, and she waved back atme again—without ever opening her eyes.“What’s going on?” my trainers whispered.“She’s seeing without eyes,” I told them. As I said, when you focus on theunknown, you get the unknown. After we finished the event in Sydney, we had amore advanced workshop in Melbourne one week later, and Sophia came to thatworkshop as well.“Hey, I saw you, and I saw the trainers,” she told me, proceeding to describeeverything that had happened in the room during the meditation when she’d hadher eyes closed. She was extremely accurate. After the workshop, Sophia decidedto apply to become one of my corporate trainers, and I selected her because ofher ability. So she came to a training just a few months later.At the end of every day of my trainings, I always have the new trainers closetheir eyes while I run through the entire day’s lessons in 30 minutes, just toreactivate the new circuits in their long-term memories. So as I was doing that,Sophia was sitting there with her eyes closed, and all of a sudden, she openedher eyes, shook her head, closed her eyes again, turned around to look behindher, and then turned back around and looked straight at me with an amazedexpression on her face. After she repeated this a few times, I motioned for herto just stay with the meditation, and we spoke afterward.Not only could Sophia see in front of her with her eyes closed in meditation,she told me, but now she could see a full 360-degree view. She could see whatwas in front of her, what was behind her, and what was all around her at thesame time. Because Sophia had been in the habit of seeing with her eyes open forher whole life, she kept opening her eyes and closing them again in a reflexiveattempt to see what she was already seeing.I happened to have Dr. Fannin at that training, and we were scanning some of thetrainers’ brains just so that we could plan what patterns of brain waves we’d bemeasuring in our students for our first advanced workshop in Arizona. When itwas Sophia’s turn, I didn’t say anything to Dr. Fannin about her. So he hookedher up to the EEG machine, and then with her back to us, we sat down about sevenfeet away to watch her scan on the monitor. All of a sudden, the back ofSophia’s brain, which is the visual cortex, lit up on the computer screen.“Oh, look!” Dr. Fannin whispered to me. “She’s visualizing!”“No,” I said softly, shaking my head. “She’s not visualizing.”“What do you mean?” he mouthed.“She’s seeing,” I quietly responded.“What do you mean?” he repeated, confused. So I waved at her. And still sittingwith her back to me, she reached above her head, turned her hand backward, andwaved back. It was amazing. The proof was right on the scan: Sophia was seeingwithout eyes. Her visual cortex was processing information, just as though shewere seeing, but it was her brain that was doing the seeing—not her eyes.As I said, if you focus on the unknown, you get the unknown. Ready to see foryourself?image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Chapter Twelve [toc.html#a17]Changing Beliefs and Perceptions Meditation [toc.html#a17]In this chapter, I’m going to walk you through a guided meditation designed tohelp you change some beliefs or perceptions about yourself or your life. Irecommend meditating while playing a recording, either of this meditation (whichhelps you change two beliefs or perceptions and lasts about an hour) or of aslightly shorter version (which helps you change one belief or perception andlasts 45 minutes). Both meditations are available for purchase on audio CDs orMP3 files from my website (www.drjoedispenza.com[http://www.drjoedispenza.com]). The one-hour version is called You Are thePlacebo Book Meditation: Changing Two Beliefs and Perceptions, and the 45-minuteversion is called You Are the Placebo Book Meditation: Changing One Belief andPerception. Or you can make a recording of yourself reading the text of eitherversion of the meditation (both of which you will find in the Appendix).Remember that beliefs and perceptions are subconscious states of being. Theystart with thoughts and feelings that you think and feel over and over, untilthey ultimately become habituated or automatic—at which point they form anattitude. Attitudes strung together become beliefs, and related beliefs strungtogether become perceptions. Over time, this redundancy creates a view of theworld and of yourself that’s largely subconscious. It affects yourrelationships, your behaviors, and really everything in your life.So if you want to change a belief or perception, you have to first change yourstate of being. And changing your state of being means changing your energy,because in order for you to affect matter, you have to become more energy andless matter, more wave and less particle. That requires you to combine a clearintention and an elevated emotion—those are the two ingredients.As you’ve read, this process involves making a decision with a high-enough levelof energy that your thought about the new belief becomes an experience thatcarries a strong emotional signature, which alters you on some level in thatmoment. That’s how you change your biology, become your own placebo, and makeyour mind matter. We all have had experiences that have affected our biology tosome degree or another. Remember the Cambodian women, from Chapter 7 [ch7.html],who developed vision problems because of the horrors they were forced to witnesswhen the Khmer Rouge was in power? That’s an extreme example, of course, but youcan use the same principle to make a positive change.In order for this to work, the new experience has to be greater than the pastexperience. In other words, the internal experience you have when you meditatehas to have a greater amplitude—greater energy—than the external past experiencethat created the belief and perception that you want to change. The body mustrespond to a new mind. So you have to put your heart into that elevated emotion;you really have to get goose bumps. You have to feel lifted, inspired,invincible, and empowered.I’ll be giving you the opportunity to change two beliefs and perceptions aboutyourself in this meditation. So before you begin, decide which two you want tochange. You can select one of the common limiting beliefs listed in Chapter 7[ch7.html], or you can come up with something else on your own—such as, I’llalways have this pain or condition, Life is too hard, People are unfriendly,Success takes a lot of work, or I’ll never change.Once you decide, get a piece of paper and draw a vertical line down the middle.On the left side, write down the two beliefs and perceptions you want to change,one on top of the other.Then think for a minute: If you don’t want to believe and perceive these thingsanymore, then what do you want to believe and perceive about yourself and yourlife? And if you did believe and perceive those new things, how would that makeyou feel? Write down the new beliefs and perceptions that you want to have onthe right side of the paper.As you’ll soon see, this meditation is in three parts:— The first part is the induction, in which you will use the open-focustechnique you read about in the last chapter to get you into more coherent alphaor theta brain-wave states where you’re more suggestible. This is vital, becausethe only way you can truly influence your heath and become the placebo is whenyour own suggestibility is enhanced.— In the second part, you’ll find the present moment and linger in the quantumvoid, where all possibilities exist.— And in the third part, you’ll change your beliefs and perceptions. Here, towalk you through what you’ll be doing when you actually sit down to meditate,I’ll give you some direction at the beginning of each part, and then the text ofthe meditation will follow in italics.If you’re an experienced meditator, feel free to do the entire meditation thewhole way through during your first time. If you’re new to meditation, you maywant to practice the first part every day for a week, then add the second partthe second week, and progress to all three parts the third week. Either way,keep doing this same meditation on a daily basis, until you see some changeshappening in your life.If you are already practicing the meditation that I outlined in Breaking theHabit of Being Yourself, I want to point out that the meditation in this book isentirely different, even though you’ll find some similarities in the way inwhich both meditations begin (the induction phase). If you can do only onemeditation per day, I recommend trying this new meditation for a few months sothat you can fully reap the benefits. Then you can decide which meditation youwant to continue with, or you can switch back and forth between the two as youwish.Induction: Creating Brain Coherence and Slower Brain Waves with Open FocusWhen you move into the open-focus meditation, you’ll be going from particle towave, from the narrow focus you usually have on people, places, and things inthe outer world to a more open focus—where you’ll be concentrating not on anyphysical thing, but on space. After all, if an atom is approximately 99.9percent energy and we’re always focusing on the particle, maybe it’s time wepaid some attention to the wave, because our awareness and our energy areintrinsically combined—putting attention on our energy is what amplifies ourenergy.When you use this technique, your brain naturally recalibrates, because to do itcorrectly, you have to let go of your analytical mind (which is very busythinking in high beta as an identity). That identity, who you know yourself tobe, is connected to the external environment, to your emotional addictions andhabits, and to time. The moment you get beyond those elements, you’re nothingbut pure consciousness, and as you read earlier, the different compartments ofyour brain begin to communicate better and your brain waves become veryorderly—they start sending a coherent signal to the rest of the body, just asyou saw in the workshop participants.Stay present during this meditation; don’t try to figure anything out and don’ttry to visualize. Just sense and feel. If you can sense where your left ankleis, if you can feel where your nose is, and if you can sense where the spacebetween your sternum and your chest is, then you’re resting your awareness, yourconsciousness, and your attention in those places. You might get a picture or animage in your head (say, of your chest or of your heart), but you don’t have tostrive for that; you just have to become aware of the space within and aroundyour body in space.This first part of the meditation should last for approximately 10 to 15minutes.Meditation: Part One [p1.html]Now . . . can you rest your awareness . . . in the space . . . between your eyes. . . in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . between your eyes . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . between your temples. . . in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . between your temples . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . that your nostrils .. . occupy in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . that the inside of your noseoccupies . . . in space?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . between your tongueand the back of your throat . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . that the back of your throatoccupies . . . in space?And now . . . can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . around your ears . .. in space?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your ears . . . inspace?And can you become aware . . . of the space . . . below your chin . . . inspace?And can you feel . . . the volume of space . . . around your neck . . . inspace?And now . . . can you sense . . . the space . . . beyond your chest . . . inspace?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . around your chest . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the volume of space . . . beyondyour shoulders . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . around your shoulders . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . behind your back . .. in space?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your spine . . . inspace?And now . . . can you rest . . . your awareness . . . in the space . . . betweenyour thighs . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . connecting your knees . . . inspace?And now . . . can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . around your feet . .. in space?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your feet . . . inspace?And can you become aware . . . of the space . . . around your entire body . . .in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your body . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space between your body and thewalls of the room . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . that the entire room occupies. . . in space?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . that all of spaceoccupies . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the space . . . that all of space takes up . . . inspace?Becoming Possibility:Finding the Present Moment and Lingering in the VoidIn this next part of the meditation, you’ll find the sweet spot of the presentmoment, where all things are possible. To do that, you must lay down youridentity and disconnect from your body, the environment, and time, because thelonger you linger in the unknown, the more you draw the unknown to you. And ifnerve cells that no longer fire together no longer wire together, you’ll besilencing the circuits in your brain that are connected to the old self. Asyou’ve read, those circuits maintain a hardwired program, so if you successfullydisconnect from them, you’ll also be disconnecting from the program. You’ll nolonger be emotionally signaling the same genes in the same way. And then as yourbody moves into a more balanced and harmonious state, you’ll find yourself inthe sweet spot of the present moment, and that’s where all possibility exists.If you find your mind drifting to thoughts about people you know, variousproblems you have, events that happened in the past or that are coming up inyour future, your body, your weight, your pain, your hunger, or even how longthis meditation will go on, simply become aware of those thoughts and then bringyour consciousness back to the blackness or the quantum void of possibility. Andthen, once more, surrender into nothing.This second part of the meditation should last for approximately 10 to 15minutes.Meditation: Part Two [p2.html]And now . . . it’s time . . . to become no body . . . no one . . . no thing . .. no where . . . in no time . . . to become . . . pure consciousness . . . tobecome an awareness in the infinite field of potentials . . . and to invest yourenergy into the unknown. . . .

Stay present. . . .[Allow 10 to 15 minutes here for you to linger.]Changing Beliefs and Perceptions about Yourself and Your LifeIn the final section of the meditation, it’s time to bring up that first beliefor perception about your life that you want to change. I’ll ask you if you wantto continue believing and perceiving in that way. If your answer is no, thenyou’ll be invited to make a decision with such firm intention that the amplitudeof energy related to that decision is greater than the hardwired programs inyour brain and the emotional addictions in your body. Your body will thenrespond to a new mind, to a new consciousness.Next I’ll ask you, “What do you want to believe and perceive about yourself andyour life, and how would that feel?” Then your task will be to move into a newstate of being. You’ll have to change your energy by marrying a clear intentionwith an elevated emotion—and lift matter to a new mind. You should get upfeeling different from when you sat down. If so, then you changed biologically.At that point, the past will no longer exist, because that higher-amplitudeexperience will have just overwritten the program of the old experience. That’swhy making that choice becomes an experience that you never forget, because nowit’s a long-term memory. You’ll be making an unknown possibility known, whichtakes you out of the past-now and puts you into the future-now, where the eventhas already happened. Remember, it’s not your job to figure out when or where orhow it’s going to happen. Your job is merely to move into a new state of beingand then see the future you’re creating.Then you’ll be guided to change the second belief or perception, so you’llrepeat the same process all over again.This final part of the meditation will last for approximately 20 to 30 minutes.Meditation: Part ThreeNow . . . what was that first belief . . . or perception . . . that you wantedto change about yourself and your life?Do you want to continue to believe and perceive in this way?If not . . .

I’m actuallyfine with that accusation at this point in my life, because what is faith butwhen we believe in thought more than anything else? Isn’t it when we accept athought—independent of the conditions in our environment—and then surrender tothe outcome to such a degree that we live as if our prayers were alreadyanswered? Sounds like a formula for the placebo. We’ve always been the placebo.Maybe it’s not so important that we pray rigorously every day to have ourprayers answered, but that we instead get up from our meditations as if ourprayers have already been answered. If we accomplish this daily, we are at alevel of mind where we’re truly living in the unknown and expecting theunexpected. And this is when the mysterious knocks on our door.The placebo response is about being healed by thought alone. Thought by itself,however, is unmanifested emotion. Once we embrace that thought emotionally, itbegins to become real—that is, it becomes reality. A thought without anemotional signature is void of experience, and thus it is latent, waiting to bemade known from the unknown. As we initiate a thought into an experience andthen into wisdom, we are evolving as human beings.When you look into the mirror, you see your reflection and know that whom youare seeing is the physical you. But how do the true self, the ego, and the soulsee themselves? Your life is a mirror image of your mind, your consciousness,and who you really are.There are no schools of ancient spiritual wisdom sitting high on mountaintops inthe Himalayas waiting to initiate us into becoming mystics and saints. Our livesare our initiation into greatness. Maybe you and I should see life as anopportunity to reach greater and greater levels of self so that we can overcomeour own limitations with more expanded levels of consciousness. That’s how apragmatist, instead of a victim, sees it.To abandon the familiar ways in which we’ve grown accustomed to thinking aboutlife in order to embrace new paradigms will feel unnatural in the beginning.Frankly, it takes effort—and it’s uncomfortable. Why? Because when we change, weno longer feel like ourselves. My definition of genius, then, is to beuncomfortable and to be okay with being uncomfortable.How many times in history have admirable individuals who struggled againstoutdated beliefs, living outside of their comfort zones, been consideredheretics and fools, only to later emerge as geniuses, saints, or masters? Intime, they became supernatural.But how do you and I become supernatural? We have to begin to do what’sunnatural—that is, to give in the midst of crisis, when everyone is feeling lackand poverty; to love when everyone is angry and judging others; to demonstratecourage and peace when everyone else is in fear; to show kindness when othersare displaying hostility and aggression; to surrender to possibility when therest of the world is aggressively pushing to be first, trying to controloutcomes, and fiercely competing in an endless drive to get to the top; toknowingly smile in the face of adversity; and to cultivate the feeling ofwholeness when we’re diagnosed as sick.It seems so unnatural to make these types of choices in the midst of suchconditions, but if we repeatedly succeed, in time we’ll transcend the norm—andwe, too, become supernatural. And most important, by your being supernatural,you give others permission to do the same. Mirror neurons fire when we observesomeone else performing an action. Our neurons mirror the neurons of that otherperson, as though we were performing the same action. For example, when you seea professional dancer dancing the salsa, you will dance the salsa better thanyou did before. If you watch Serena Williams hit a tennis ball, you will hit theball better than you did before. If you observe someone leading a community withlove and compassion, you’ll lead in your life in the same way. And if youwitness someone self-healing from a disease by changing his or her thoughtprocesses, you’ll be more prone to do the same.It’s my hope that after reading this book, you’ll realize that the ultimatebelief is the belief in yourself and in the field of infinite possibilities—andwhen you merge the belief in yourself as a subjective consciousness with yourbelief in an objective consciousness, then you’re balancing intention andsurrender. It’s tricky, though. If you overintend (that’s called “trying”),you’ll get in your own way and always fall short of your vision. If youoversurrender, you’ll become too lazy, apathetic, and uninspired. But if youcombine a clear intention with an uncompromising trust in possibility, thenyou’ll step into the unknown, and that’s when the supernatural starts to unfold.I think that you and I are at our best when we’re in this state of being.When these two states merge, I believe that we drink from a deeper well. Andwhen wholeness, self-satisfaction, and self-love truly come from within, becauseyou’ve ventured beyond what you believed was possible and you overcame your ownself-imposed limitations, that’s when the uncommon occurs. To be happy withyourself in the present moment while maintaining a dream of your future is agrand recipe for manifestation.When you feel so whole that you no longer care whether “it” will happen, that’swhen amazing things materialize before your eyes. I’ve learned that being wholeis the perfect state of creation. I’ve seen this time and time again inwitnessing true healings in people all over the world. They feel so completethat they no longer want, no longer feel lack, and no longer try to do itthemselves. They let go, and to their amazement, something greater than they areresponds—and they laugh at the simplicity of the process.This book and my research are, hopefully, a beginning and not the end. I’llcertainly be the first to raise my hand to confess that I don’t know it all. Mygreatest joy, though, is when I’ve contributed to someone’s personal growth insome way. I’ve seen transformation on many faces, and I can say that independentof culture, race, or gender, we all look the same when we’re freed from thebonds of our own self-limiting beliefs.image [images/line1.jpg]There’s a principle that I adore in biology called emergence. Have you ever seena school of fish all breaking in the same direction at the same time? Or a flockof hundreds of birds in flight, all moving together as one consciousness—as onemind? When you look at this phenomenon, you might think that all the individualsin the group are following one leader who’s showing the way. It appears that thesynchronistic movements of hundreds or even thousands of individual organismsall doing the same thing at the same time is a top-down phenomenon. But that’snot what’s really happening.It turns out that this level of unity takes place as a bottom-up phenomenon. Thegroup actually has no leader; everyone is leading. They’re all part of the samecollective consciousness, doing the same thing at the same time. It’s as if thewhole is connected in a field of information beyond space and time. Onecommunity is presenting as one mind. One organism is created from eachindividual becoming one. There’s power in numbers.We’ve been programmed and conditioned into a subconscious belief that if we leadwith too much passion and change the world, we’ll surely be assassinated. Mostgreat leaders who’ve altered the course of history with a profound message “getit” in the end. Whether we’re talking about Martin Luther King, Jr.; MahatmaGandhi; John Lennon; Joan of Arc; William Wallace; Jesus of Nazareth; or AbrahamLincoln, an unconscious stigma exists that suggests that all visionary leadersmust give their lives for the truth. But maybe we’ve finally arrived at the timein history when it’s more important to live for the truth than to die for it.If hundreds, thousands, or even millions of human beings embrace a newconsciousness based on possibility; align their actions with their intentions;and live by greater universal laws of love, kindness, and compassion, a newconsciousness will emerge—and we’ll experience true oneness. Then, we might justhave too many leaders to remove.So if, on a daily basis, you’re committed to demonstrating your personal bestand you’re overcoming selfish states of mind driven by stress hormones—and I’mdoing the same—then together, we’re changing the world by changing ourselves.And if enough of us are tempering ourselves into more whole human beings, thenas the individual communities we live in emerge around the world, they’lleventually consume the present mind-set of reality based on fear, competition,lack, hostility, greed, and deception. In time, the old will be completelyconsumed by the new. A particular concern of mine is that we now live in a worldwhere scientific research is commingled with self-interest and often influencedby profits, so I question whether we’re being told the truth about the waythings really are. It’s up to us, then, to discover the truth for ourselves.Imagine a world inhabited by billions of people, just like a school of fish,living as one—where everyone is embracing similar uplifting thoughts connectedto unlimited possibility, and these thoughts allow people to make more inspiredchoices, demonstrate more altruistic behaviors, and create more enlighteningexperiences. People would then no longer be living by the survival-basedemotions we’re so familiar with now: feeling more like matter than energy,separate from possibility. Instead, they’d be living by more expanded, selfless,heartfelt emotions—feeling more like energy than matter, connected to somethinggreater.If we could do this, then an entirely different world would emerge, and we wouldbe living by a new credo based on the open heart. That’s what I see when I closemy eyes to meditate.— Dr. Joe Dispenzaimage [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX [toc.html#a19]Script of the Changing Beliefs and Perceptions Meditation [toc.html#a19]If you want to make your own guided-meditation recording, instead of purchasingone of the prerecorded audio CDs or MP3 versions from my website, feel free torecord yourself reading one of the following two scripts.

Asyou’ll see, I’ve added a note after the second part of each meditation,reminding you to include a period of silence on your recording so that you canlinger in the unknown before you begin the last part of the meditation, whereyou’ll change either one or two beliefs or perceptions.Hour-long Version of Meditation (changing two beliefs and perceptions)Now . . . can you rest your awareness . . . in the space . . . between your eyes. . . in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . between your eyes . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . between your temples. . . in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . between your temples . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . that your nostrils .. . occupy in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . that the inside of your noseoccupies . . . in space?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . between your tongueand the back of your throat . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . that the back of your throatoccupies . . . in space?And now . . . can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . around your ears . .. in space?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your ears . . . inspace?And can you become aware . . . of the space . . . below your chin . . . inspace?And can you feel . . . the volume of space . . . around your neck . . . inspace?And now . . . can you sense . . . the space . . . beyond your chest . . . inspace?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . around your chest . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the volume of space . . . beyondyour shoulders . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . around your shoulders . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . behind your back . .. in space?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your spine . . . inspace?And now . . . can you rest . . . your awareness . . . in the space . . . betweenyour thighs . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . connecting your knees . . . inspace?And now . . . can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . around your feet . .. in space?And can you feel . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your feet . . . inspace?And can you become aware . . . of the space . . . around your entire body . . .in space?And can you sense . . . the energy of space . . . beyond your body . . . inspace?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space between your body and thewalls of the room . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the volume of space . . . that the entire room occupies. . . in space?And now . . . can you become aware . . . of the space . . . that all of spaceoccupies . . . in space?And can you sense . . . the space . . . that all of space takes up . . . inspace?And now . . . it’s time . . . to become no body . . . no one . . . no thing . .. no where . . . in no time . . . to become . . . pure consciousness . . . tobecome an awareness in the infinite field of potentials . . . and to invest yourenergy into the unknown. . . .

During the Middle Ages, thedeceased’s family often hired mourners to sing these verses, and because theirfake grieving was sometimes over the top, the word placebo came to mean“flatterer” or “toady.” In the early 19th century, doctors began giving inerttonics, pills, and other treatments to pacify patients whom they couldn’t helpor who sought medical attention for imagined ills; these doctors borrowed theterm placebo and gave it its current meaning.4.

In thefirst, subjects wore special goggles made so that if they looked to the left,everything appeared blue and if they looked to the right, everything appearedyellow. After a certain period of time, they no longer saw the blue and yellowtints; the world appeared the way it always had before, because they were seeingit not through their eyes but through their brains, which filled in realitybased on their memories; see I. Kohler, The Formation and Transformation of thePerceptual World (New York: International Universities Press, 1964). In theother study, when depressives were shown two different pictures—one of acelebratory feast and one of a funeral—in rapid-fire fashion, they rememberedthe funeral scene more often than chance would allow, indicating that we tend toperceive the environment in a way that reinforces how we feel; see A.

Theamount of sheer effort it takes just to make the time to write and researchwhile running a very busy integrated health clinic and traveling almost everyweek—never mind time for family, staff meetings, and even sleeping oreating—doesn’t leave me the leisure of staring out a picture window viewingnature while taking long pauses to reflect upon the next thought I’m about totype.I’ve learned that bringing an immaterial idea into material reality requires agreat deal of persistence, determination, focus, endurance, energy, time,creativity, and—most important—support. Personally, the only way I could pullany of this off is with the unconditional love, encouragement, assistance, andcooperation of my professional relationships, my staff, my friends, and myfamily. For them, I am forever grateful.I would like to express my gratitude to the Hay House team for their belief inme again. I feel honored and blessed to be a part of such a nice family. Thankyou, Reid Tracy, Stacey Smith, Shannon Littrell, Alex Freemon, Christy Salinas,and the rest of the team. I hope I have contributed to each of you in some way.And every once in a while, an angel blesses us in our lives. These angels areusually humble, selfless, powerful, and very devoted.
