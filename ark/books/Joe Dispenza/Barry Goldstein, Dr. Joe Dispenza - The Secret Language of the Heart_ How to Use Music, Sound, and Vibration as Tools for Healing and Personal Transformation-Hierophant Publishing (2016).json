As part of my daily routine between homework andsports activities, it was a very firm requirement that I practice piano for atleast one hour after school. I'd start each session by running my fingers up anddown the keys, playing all of the scales—both sharps and flats. Then I wouldhammer out all of the chords that I knew in every key—major, minor, dominant,half diminished, and fully diminished. And if I made a mistake, I'd hear a stompthundering from the ceiling, as if God was listening to me from above. Ofcourse, I knew that I had to start all over again from the beginning and notrush through the sequences. Once my fingers were totally connected to my brain,I would do my best to master a classical piece composed by Chopin, Bach,Beethoven, or Brahms.Upon reflection, I think those eight years of my childhood were more of a prisonsentence than a sign of creative ambition. It was only in the last few yearsthat I was allowed to play jazz, blues, pop, or rock and roll. As you canimagine, being a young kid, playing anything other than classical music wasliberating. For hours I'd watch in awe as Elton John and Billy Joel played theivories with such command, such passion, and such grace—and they never made amistake or needed to look at the keys. As a result, I wanted only one thing: toplay without ever looking at my hands, and, at the same time, to possess theability to improvise into some creative, altered state of mind.It never happened. My interests changed. I became more involved in academia, asocial life, and high school sports. After all, there are only so many hours ina day. My father was disappointed I didn't continue studying piano, and he wouldalways say the same thing when I fought him with the resistance of any maleadolescent with elevated testosterone levels: “One day you will wish you neverstopped.” He was right.When I met Barry Goldstein many years ago, I fell in love with him and hismusic. He is an award-winning musician with a unique talent and skill for makingmusic, sound, vibration, and coherence all come together for us. He is a truecomposer, a modern-day classical artist with sensitivity for moving the heartsand souls of all who have the ears to hear. He has touched my mind, my heart,and my soul in so many ways with his various masterpieces. Meeting him andlistening to his tunes has rekindled my enthusiasm for music. Plus, he's cool.I have had the privilege of leading large workshops around the world teachingpeople how to use meditation to change their internal states, to heal themselvesof various maladies, and to create better lives for themselves. The model oftransformation that I use combines the principles of quantum physics,neuroscience, neuroendocrinology, psychoneuroimmunology, and epigenetics. Ibelieve that science has become the contemporary language of mysticism.Theses are big words, but don't be intimidated. Each of these fields points thefinger at possibility and suggests that we are not doomed by our genes orhardwired to be a certain way for the rest of our lives. They propose that wehave control of our destiny, that we are marvels of adaptability, and that wecan change at any age. I have witnessed true miracles in people's lives whenthey apply and personalize these theories into practical experience.This is where Barry Goldstein comes in. He is a major orchestrator of thoseconditions in our seminars. Barry and I have been working together for overthree years. He has played live music during the meditations in our five-dayadvanced workshops. We have over five hundred people attending these events fromall over the world and have completed a total of nine events to date. The typeof meditations we do vary depending on what we are intending to accomplish. Somelast one hour, some two hours, and some even three hours—and we do threemeditations per day. Each one is always different, and so is the music ourparticipants hear.You have to imagine this. The lights are very low and hundreds of people aresitting, eyes closed, in a large ballroom. Barry is on stage with me, sitting athis keyboard. He is watching me (not looking down at his keys) and we areimprovising. It's my childhood dream, but I'm not playing. Barry is, becausehe's a master of his craft.I actually don't know how all of this unfolds, but I can tell you all I am doingis making hand signals while staring into Barry's eyes. And he is intuitivelyplaying music and making the right sounds that quickly change our students'brain waves from a state of wakefulness into a state of transcendence; thatalter the type of brain waves they produce to become more coherent andsynchronized; that sustain those brain states for extended periods of time; thatquiet the analytical mind and lower the volume to intrusive thoughts; that helpopen their hearts so they can embrace more elevated emotions, causing theirhearts to beat in a more orderly and coherent manner, which then begins toproduce a strong magnetic signal from that part of the body; that inspire themto transform some aspect of their limited beliefs; and, most importantly, thatenable them to get beyond themselves.I bet you are wondering how I know that all of these phenomena are occurring.It's simple. I have a team of researchers and scientists who measure ourstudents' biological changes during our advanced events. We do regularquantitative studies on the brain (EEG), the heart (HRV and EKG), the energy ofthe room (GDV), and the energy emitted around people's bodies (GDV). So I knowthat Barry's music makes our students' brains work better, enhances the energyfields surrounding their bodies, and enriches the ambient energy field of theballroom. And his recipes of sounds and tones have created more measureableheart coherence, as you will learn in this book.Our research has shown that a clear intention (which is an act of a focused andcoherent mind), coupled with an elevated emotion like joy, gratitude, care,wholeness, freedom, and compassion (which is a function of the heart) changespeople's states of being. Barry's music is the necessary component for theprocess.Barry has taken my audiences into elegant and deep states of mind. He hasregularly composed music to transcend this reality. His original music helps ourstudents get beyond their bodies, disconnect from their environment, and forgetabout time. That's when the magic happens. By artfully filling the space of theroom with rhythmic vibrations, tones, sounds, and energetic waves, Barry helpseveryone forget that their outer world exists. Only when the inner world is morereal than the outer world can the brain and body change form. Barry's musicseduces us into those transcendent, blissful realms.So take your time. Maybe turn on some of his music. And read this book with anopen mind and heart. Barry's certainly done his homework to educate you aboutthe world of sound and vibration. He has also given you ways to let go ofanything that stands in the way of you and your true potential. I hope you enjoythis book as much as I have.—Dr. Joe DispenzaNew York Times best-selling author of You Arethe Placebo and Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself"},{"pageContent":"NOTE TO READERSThis book is not intended as a substitute for medical advice of your physician.The reader should consult a physician in matters relating to his/her health andparticularly with respect to any symptoms that may require diagnosis or medicalattention."},{"pageContent":"PREFACEMUSIC IS A LANGUAGE that has spoken to me my entire life. From the time I pickedup the guitar and learned three chords, I've been passionate about writingsongs. I remember sitting on the edge of my bed creating vocal melodies overchord progressions. It was official: I was in love! Music was always a vehiclefor me to share my heart, and at the same time it touched mine. Although I didnot know it at the time, it was within my musical process that my spiritualpractice evolved. Music set the foundation for a harmonious love affair thatprovided the perfect balance of giving and receiving with something beyondmyself.As my aspirations to become a professional musician manifested, somethingchanged. Somewhere along the way, as music became my livelihood, it also becamea job. In 1997, I came to the realization that I needed to make a change. I'dbeen working as a musician and record producer in New York City for ten years,and the process of creating a four-minute song was taking an average of fifty toa hundred hours. Between composing, producing, and dealing with record companyexecutives and recording artists, my love for music was getting lost in theprocess. Something was missing.I longed to reconnect with my love for music and take it into a new realm, but Ididn't know where to start. How could I reconnect with that twelve-year-old boywithin, the one who sat on the edge of his bed writing songs in pure bliss? Iwas at a crossroads, at the intersection where it all started: my heart. This iswhere my love for music was birthed, and I knew this was where it needed to berebirthed.I began seeking answers on the Internet, and I remember typing music and heartinto a search engine. I'm not sure exactly what I was looking for in thatmoment, but I learned that a human heart in a relaxed state beats about 60 timesper minute. I knew that the measurement of beats per minute was used in music todesignate how fast or slow a piece of music moved (tempo). This prompted me toincorporate the tempo of 60 beats per minute into some of my compositions withthe intention that the pulse of the music would take me to a more relaxed,present state where I could reconnect with my heart, my passion, and my love formusic. In addition, I was curious what would happen if I just allowed the musicto move through me and speak to me as opposed to formally composing it. Thisprocess of listening and trusting my musical intuition at a new level excitedme! This was the beginning of allowing music, the secret language of the heart,to speak to me once again. This time, it went beyond listening with “all ears”;it was with “all heart!”This was a journey of moving back into harmonic alignment with my heart, andwithin it I discovered a new process of creating. Instead of composing, as I'ddone for so many years, I was now de-composing music. From a state ofrelaxation, both mental and physical, I rediscovered my love for music. I beganeach new piece with the intention that it would serve the highest capacity ofhealing for each individual listening, starting with myself. And it did. I foundmyself moving to deep meditative states, and at the same time it was veryrejuvenating. The stressed-out, type-A New Yorker who'd lost his passion formusic began to disappear, and in this healing a new way of creating musicevolved. I began to build layers within the music based solely on my intuition,never knowing what chords or melodies would come next. This painted some uniqueharmonics, combining layers of notes and frequencies that felt otherworldly.While I was used to being “in the zone” while composing in the past, this wasdifferent from anything I had ever created.As I composed these pieces, it felt like my heartbeat and the music I wasproducing in the studio were perfectly in sync. This is the very definition ofentrainment; an internal rhythm (my heartbeat) syncing with an external rhythm(the music). When this occurs, it can create an orderly heart rhythm (coherence)that has many health benefits. In addition, this new process took the pressuresthat occurred in my mind out of the picture and allowed me to become a vehiclefor a unique synergy with a greater power to manifest a sacred co-creation. Inthis unique process of reaching a relaxed state through creating music, my body,mind, and spirit moved back into balance.I believe this music achieved success so effortlessly because listeners felt theintention that was embedded within. It also assisted my healing process andoverall health on many levels: my stress levels decreased significantly, my bodywas less tense, and I was sleeping more soundly. The pieces I created while inthis state went on to become my CD series Ambiology, and the music, sound, andvibration of this series are assisting people with sleep disorders, anxiety,stress, brain harmony, focus, and clarity, as well as shifting the environment.It was these successes that created a thirst for understanding why my music wasworking from a scientific basis. At the time, Dr. Donese Worden (who is now myfiancée) was using my music to treat insomnia in her patients. She encouragedand assisted me in researching the benefits of how music can be used to treatspecific medical conditions. It became a unique relationship that was kind oflike Reese's Peanut Butter Cups—I got my music in her medicine, and she got hermedicine in my music. After researching for three years, I began to lecture atmedical conferences on music's ability to benefit specific conditions, and weare now conducting research studies to determine the health benefits of mymusic.In addition, implementing a musical program into my own life allowed me toreclaim my energy, clarify my purpose, and provide me with the focus to reachnew levels of success, including coproducing a Grammy Award–winning track withLes Paul, the inventor of the solid body electric guitar.The Native Americans have a saying: “The longest journey you will ever take isfrom your mind to your heart.” As my spiritual path has developed over the pasttwenty years, I have uncovered more and more information that supports myexperience of how music can be used as a vehicle for healing, to ignite creativeenergy and to guide us back to our hearts. Whether you are creating a piece ofart, writing a business plan, or redecorating your home, you can make yourcreative process more sacred, put your mind more at ease, and improve yourphysical health through the conscious and consistent use of music.Each of our lives can be a beautiful song. The same principles that create thissong can be utilized to create a magnificent life. We can bring harmony into ourrelationships, find rhythm in our careers, and provide sound advice to friendsand loved ones. We can orchestrate new opportunities, compose new ideas, andconduct our lives with integrity. At the same time, we can learn to removedissonance from challenging situations, arrange our energy more effectively, andlearn to listen beyond just hearing. We are meant to live a musical life."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTIONMusical training is a more potent instrument thanany other, because rhythm and harmony find their wayinto the inward places of the soul, imparting grace, andmaking the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful.—PlatoIT'S HARD TO SAY WHEN I FIRST realized music could be a transformational tool. Iremember sitting on our piano bench, feet dangling with the floor miles away, asmy mother sat next to me, her feet dangling too. My mom was only four feet fiveinches tall, but she had the spirit of a giant. I was two or three then, but Iremember how each note filled the room as my mother sang the playful HarryBelafonte song “Yellow Bird.” As she sang, her small fingers lay gently on topof mine, striking the keys in time with each note she sang. I sat in wide-eyedwonder as I felt the vibration of the piano notes matching her voice. This iswhat I now know to be resonance, her voice's vibration magnifying the vibrationof the piano note. Even after the notes played, they hung in the air, like abeautiful hummingbird sharing its song. The notes changed the room, as did thespace between the notes. Both were so beautiful, and when they stopped the roomfelt so empty.I think it was then that I seeded a longing to fill the room with music and tofeel the space between the notes. My mom was never formally trained in music;she played by ear, and she informally passed this gift on to me. She knew thenthat music is to be felt by the heart. I can still feel her tiny fingers on topof mine guiding me over the ivory keys, guiding me through my firsttransformational experience with music. My heart is filled with gratitude forher gift to me: sharing the power of song to shift ordinary moments intolife-altering experiences.It is in this vibration of gratitude that I would like to begin our journeytogether into the secret language of the heart. I am so thankful to have theopportunity to share a beautiful gift that all of us have been given access to.We have opened this gift at many times in our lives and have been blessed tohave it touch our souls on a deep level. Music has always been there, from ourfirst lullaby and first kiss to the prom dance, sweet sixteen, breakups andmakeups, weddings, anniversaries, baby showers—virtually every important momentof our lives. While friends may come and go, careers may shift, and hair maydisappear over the years, music will always be here. Thank you, music!Music is a common chord that weaves through every culture, speaking to us in asecret language, a language from and of the soul, one that speaks beyond reason,race, and religion. Music defines the indefinable and gives meaning to thetapestry of moments woven together to create our lives. These moments define oursoul's path and how our unique vibration ripples outward in the world.That is why music is here: to communicate what words cannot, and to assist inintegrating the wisdom of our minds and the lessons of our hearts for thepurpose of our personal and spiritual evolution. When we can see music in thislight, it becomes more than just art and entertainment; it is a translator ofdivine thought, and a way of life. It is a powerful vehicle to transform us onthe deepest level, from the inside out.In this book, we will tap into music's known power as art and entertainment andalso move beyond that to unleash its full potential to enhance and improve ourhealth and quality of life. If your soul has been longing for something to trulytouch your heart and assist you, look no further. Music is here for you. As webring awareness to music, sound, and vibration on a daily basis, we experienceit in a new way—internally to externally. There is music that exists inside yourphysical body. It is a precious gift never to be taken for granted, for it isyour own unique sound and vibration that communicates to you beyond words, asyou will soon learn.When we talk about utilizing music to improve our health, it is not just thephysical body we are talking about. To get the full picture of health, we mustlook at the four-body system: the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritualbodies. Each has a unique role in our total health. Throughout the book, youwill hear me refer to this concept as the four bodies.Music has the potential to transform, but change is not always an easy thing,for change needs to initiate from a deeper level. Change must move past thesurface, past our limited emotions, beliefs, and negative patterns. It must movebeyond our physicality and our programming of the mind. For true transformationto occur, change must immerse itself in our being; it must touch our heart andsoul. That's what we'll work on in the course of this book, with music as aconduit."},{"pageContent":"WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS BOOKWe'll start by discussing the music that is within each and every one of us—ourheartbeat, our breath, and our sigh. From there, we'll learn how music and soundcan affect the body and the brain. Armed with this knowledge, we'll implement adaily practice that has you using music strategically throughout your day toboost your mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual health. Music is a powertool that can improve, redesign, and reignite your day.Another key thing I want you to take away from this book is the importance ofhaving a daily music practice. To help you get started, each chapter has tips,exercises, and techniques you can incorporate into your practice to suit yourneeds. I encourage you to try each one at least once, and keep the ones thatwork best for you."},{"pageContent":"SOUND TOOLS FOR TRANSFORMATIONThe end of each chapter provides additional tools that allow you to integratethe topics and information into your life through an experience. Reading is muchdifferent than applying your knowledge, and I encourage you to have your ownunique experiences bringing each chapter into your life."},{"pageContent":"SUGGESTED MUSICOne of the most challenging things about writing a book about music is thatthere is no actual music in it. To remedy this, I have suggested music in mostof the chapters that complements the subject matter. I have handpicked thismusic after seeing what has assisted people on a daily basis for over fifteenyears. In some cases, I have suggested my own compositions when they have had aproven beneficial track record on the specific topic at hand.Don't just zip through the book. Utilize the suggested music as a tool tointegrate the information provided in each chapter. This moves you beyond justthinking about the topic and allows you to experience it, feel it in your mind,body, and soul, and integrate it. This is one of music's wonderful gifts; itallows us to integrate wisdom and knowledge. There is also suggested music forthe experiential processes that will elevate your experience.EXPERIENCEEverything I have learned about music, sound, and vibration over the last fortyyears has been seeded by an experience. These experiences have transformed mylife, ignited my curiosity, and inspired me to form my own hypotheses that I amexcited to share with you here. I believe that inspiration creates inspiration,and I hope my stories and research will inspire new creative adventures for youas well.RESEARCHEven before the times of Pythagoras, music and the sciences have danced hand inhand. Along with my personal experience, I've also cited numerous studies toshow that these assertions of music's innate power have scientific legs. Thereis still much more work to be done on the effects of music on our health,creativity, and peace of mind, but the research presented here will help deepenyour understanding of this emerging field of study.Of course, the suggestions you have just read are geared toward optimizing yourexperience. One of the major points of this book is to discover what resonateswith you. The intention is that you utilize this book to become an expert onwhat feels sound to your instrument—your physical, mental, emotional, andspiritual bodies.It's time to rejuvenate and replenish our souls. It's time to stop holding backour gifts on any level. It's time to share ourselves in the world, for we are soneeded. It's time to tune up and tune in to create a new song of harmony, peace,love, compassion, and kindness.Just as creating a meditative practice can change your life, so can creating amusical practice. This does not mean you have to be a musician, but it does meanyou can incorporate music into your life with intention to createtransformation. Incorporating the information, tools, exercises, and musicalsuggestions contained here will help you to manage your daily stresses, enhanceyour creativity, and master your emotional and physical well-being. Are youready to create that shift? Then let's begin!"},{"pageContent":"– PART ONE –MUSIC AS A HEALING TOOL"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00002.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"1THE MUSIC WITHINMusic in the soul can be heard by the universe.—Lao TzuAS YOU SHALL SOON SEE, music, sound, and vibration are powerful tools to createexpansion and healing. One of the reasons that music can be such a strongvehicle for transformation is its ability to shift our emotions in a positiveway. When we can transform our emotions or remove an emotional block, we openthe door for healing to occur. Many of us affect our health negatively on adaily basis by either ignoring or not bringing awareness to our emotions.Ongoing negative emotions can impact our physical, mental, emotional, andspiritual bodies—even if we are unaware of them.Even if I start my day in a relaxed state from meditating, listening to music,or playing my guitar, it's not unusual for me to get to my recording studiotwenty minutes later stressed. A lot can happen in a twenty-minute walk to workin New York City! Walking down six floors of stairs, horns honking on EighthAvenue, stepping in dog poo, police sirens, homeless people asking for money,rain and no umbrella, only one elevator working in the recording studio, thecomputer not booting up . . . Talk about stimulating your five senses! And thisis before my workday really starts.Upon getting to the studio and checking my messages, I learn that a project thatwas due at the end of the week is now being moved up to tomorrow. With theinevitable prospect of an all-night recording session, I begin to feel someanxiety. I need to schedule singers to get the background vocals done and find abass player at the last minute. It all begins to paint a not-so-pretty andstressful picture. As I dive into my work, I begin to feel tightness in my neck,and an uneasy feeling in my stomach. My emotions are beginning to affect myphysical body.In addition, I feel a bit nervous and notice my usual patience in situations hasdiminished. As my day unfolds, I find myself snapping at people. A situationthat I normally would have let pass elevates into an angry argument. My emotionsare beginning to affect my mental body.The walk I take in Central Park during my lunch break is blown off and replacedby a phone call to a friend where I vent and relive my stressful morning. Thedeeper connection and faith that I usually feel while being in nature is nowabsent in my day. My emotions are beginning to affect my spiritual body.After an all-night recording session, I send the final mix to the record companyand release a big sigh. I notice how much stress I was holding as the sound ofmy breath is released, and I notice how much lighter I feel.What if the stressful day that I had is a typical reoccurring day? The onlythings that change are the situations, but the stress is never managed. Thisongoing unawareness of how our emotions effect our physical, mental, andspiritual bodies can lead to such challenges as lower back pain, insomnia, highblood pressure, disease, anxiety, and depression. Any one of these could make aperson feel incomplete or out of balance, the feeling and state of beingunhealthy.Your challenging day may be different. Maybe you are under some financialstress; maybe you are going through a tough breakup; or perhaps a loved one hasrecently passed. Every one of these situations can have many different levels ofstress that can snowball into challenges in our four bodies—spiritual, mental,emotional, and physical—and our overall health.The good news is that the opposite is true as well. Positive emotional statescan benefit our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. The healing processis all about moving back into balance and returning to our natural state ofwholeness. Not just finding a cure, but finding our health.Music can provide an antidote to our venomous emotional states if we becomeaware of the healing power that it holds. Music is more than just a song on aradio; it is a language that exists inside you, and one that you can tap into toalleviate emotional stressors that challenge your spiritual, mental, emotional,and physical health. By using music, sound, and vibration, we can bring our fourbodies back into balance, and create space for deep healing.As you can see, I needed a tool to combat stress on a daily basis. I needed away to come back home to my heart in a short period of time. The processes Iwill share in this chapter helped me to re-center and bring a knowing that aslong as I have my heartbeat, my breath, and my sigh, everything is truly okay.In finding this knowing, I am able to shift to a state of gratitude where thesmaller daily challenges melt away into the “sound” breathing processes. I havea path to move into the sacred process of creation with clear heart, clear mind,and clear intentions.There is an amazing power that the sounds within us contain. We will begin totap into their ability to act as a catalyst to release negative emotions, mentalblocks, and physical stress on a regular basis. I have incorporated them into myown daily program to jump-start my four bodies in their innate ability to heal,and I have personally seen amazing results. Since I have implemented thesebreathing techniques into my life, I very rarely have a day like the one Ishared with you earlier. I know that these breathing techniques will be apowerful transformational tool in your days and life as well! They are aninvitation to you to come back home to your heart."},{"pageContent":"INTERNAL MUSICThe music within, or our internal music, is always with us. It is the music thatis created from our bodies themselves through three sources: the sacredheartbeat, the breath, and sigh. Each person's internal music is a uniquesymphony within that is calling out for us to listen and is communicating theneeds of the four bodies. Internal music is also a helpful tool for dealing withdaily stressors, as your internal music is always with you and available to you.We can use the sacred heartbeat, breath, and sigh to create, cultivate, andinduce our four bodies' healing patterns. Ultimately, we are the true conductorsof these instruments that create our foundation for how we manage our health andquality of life.THE SACRED HEARTBEATJust as the drums and rhythm section create the musical foundation for how wesynchronize and entrain to a musical piece, the heartbeat is our internal rhythmthat synchronizes us to inner peace. It is this same sound that connects us toeach other and to the rhythm of everything in the universe while we are in ourbodies. The sound and vibration of our heartbeat is a symbol that we are alivein this moment.By coming home to your heart, you tap into your heart's magnificent vibrationand its music. The more you listen to your heart, literally, the more it speaksback to you. It sends messages to you during your decision-making processes.Maybe you've noticed an uneasy feeling in your stomach or something telling younot to move forward in a situation. Maybe you got goose bumps or chills when asong affected you in a profound way. Your heart is constantly singing a secretlanguage to you, calling out and sending signals for you to listen. And when youdo, it is life changing!THE SACRED HEARTBEAT PROCESSThe Sacred Heartbeat Process is a simple but powerful meditative exercise bywhich you can learn to be more in touch with your heart. I like to use thisprocess whenever I feel disconnected from my heart—especially if I have a bigdecision to make. Coming back to your heart and listening for its guidance canhelp you to have more clarity and less anxiety in the decisions you make becauseyou are able to tap into your heart's unique intelligence.Bring your hands to your heart, palms together, and begin to slowly breathe inand out of your heart as you bring in the intention that you are about to touchsomething very sacred. Like you would gently hold a newborn baby or pet akitten, this is the energy that your hands send to your heart. Imagine yourheart receiving this energy as a child receives a hug, or a lover savors agentle caress. No matter what challenges are going on in your life, your heartis still beating and emanating its own music. Drink this in and allow yourselfto feel the blessing of being alive. Take a few more moments and continue tosend loving energy to your heart, allowing this process of giving and receivingto expand.As you connect more and more with your heart's intelligence, you begin tocultivate your intuition and a “knowing beyond knowing.” I define this as theability to gain access to intelligence and wisdom beyond the boundaries of ourthinking minds. You begin to know and understand what is specifically right foryou because you are listening to your heart.Using this process often, we begin to trust our intuition, and in this state ofconnection our heart becomes the internal advisor and conductor of whatresonates with us and benefits us. We spend most of our time sorting throughlife situations and challenges through our mental process, without the awarenessthat our heart is constantly serenading us, guiding us, speaking to us; but byusing the Sacred Heartbeat Process, you can reconnect with your heart and takeits guidance into consideration as well."},{"pageContent":"DIVINE BREATHING AND THE POWER OF THE SIGHIf the heart is our internal drummer, the breath is the conductor that leadsthis internal rhythm section. As we breathe in, we receive our life-force. As weexhale and sigh, we release negative emotions and stress as we empty our vessel.Each breath is a new opportunity to hear and develop a deeper relationship withour inner music. Among this inner music, the sigh is another valuable tool forbreathing exercises, as the sigh gives us further control over our breathing,and is part of the internal music we create on a daily basis.One major benefit of working with the breath is that we can influence ourautonomic nervous system in a powerful way. The autonomic nervous system is notunder our conscious control, but it has the important job of regulating ourbodily functions such as breathing, the heartbeat, and digestive processes. Ourbreath is one of the biggest influencers of this vital system, which is why itis important to connect to and be aware of our breathing. The following exercisewill help you bring awareness to this bodily system and use it to youradvantage.BREATHING EXERCISESlowly breathe in. Hold the breath for a moment, and then release it with anaudible sigh. Try this several times. Now, bring more of a focus on each breath.As you inhale, visually direct the breath into one area of the body, perhaps toa place where your body currently feels tense or to where you normally holdtension. As you inhale, flex or contract the muscles in that area. As youexhale, let out a powerful sigh and relax that area. Continue doing thisthroughout your physical body, with particular focus on areas that feel tense orstressed. As you release the sound of the sigh, these areas will begin to feellighter and less tense.One of the main reasons we hold so much tension in our bodies is we forget howpowerful the breath can be in releasing physical and emotional stress. Bypausing and taking one moment to ourselves, we can utilize our breath to“address the stress” and prevent it from escalating into potentially hazardoushealth issues.When we practice these breathing techniques, the breath, the sigh, and heart arein constant communication, orchestrating a sense of inner peace. As we releasethe sigh, not only does our physical body relax, but our mental, emotional, andspiritual bodies relax as well. The sigh is a soul sound that says, In thismoment, everything is all right. By becoming consciously aware of our heartbeatand our breath, and the use of our sighs, we feel more connected to the peace ofthe present moment. Our heartbeat, breath, and sigh are our umbilical cord tonourishing a deeper spiritual connection."},{"pageContent":"FINDING YOUR UNIQUE HEART CODEAs we focus more on the interaction of our heart and breath, this focus blossomsto create a deeper understanding and a more intimate relationship with ourheart. In addition, we begin to see that there is a unique relationship betweenour heart and our brain, with each having its own independent intelligence. Aswe become more familiar with their specific roles, we can shift back and forthbased on what is needed in different circumstances. If you overthink situations,experience a lot of mind chatter, second-guess decisions, or are locked intolimited belief systems that define you, it's time to give the brain a break.Your heart is always inviting you to shed the illusion of who you think you areand come home to who you truly are. In the center of you, within your heart, youcarry your own unique vibration, your own heart code. No one else has the exactvibration that you do. This vibration carries your gifts and your authenticity,the things you are here to share in the world. This is who you truly are. Yourheart code is constantly speaking to you, waiting to be deciphered, and you arethe only one who can do this. The following exercise that works with the musicwithin—the heartbeat, the breath, and the sigh—will assist you in finding thisstate of harmony.HEART SONG BREATHING PROCESSLet's incorporate the sacred heartbeat, the divine breath, and the soul sound ofthe sigh into a powerful process that will allow you to access a more balanced,peaceful state. In this energy you will be more able to tap into the subtlelanguage of your heart and open the door to finding your unique heart code.This process will incorporate three sacred breaths.To begin, stand up and gently place your hands on your heart. Spread your feetslightly more than shoulder width apart, as if they are creating the base of apyramid that points to your heart.BREATH ONEImage [../images/00003.jpeg]As you inhale, visualize bringing the breath in through the bottom of your feet,all the way up your legs, through the hips and abdomen, lower and mid-back, allthe way to your heart. As you exhale, visualize releasing this breath outthrough your heart, and let the breath go with a powerful sigh.This breath works to clear stresses and stagnant energy held in the lower body,nurturing us through each step we take on our spiritual path. It is imbued withlove and appreciation for all that is. It unites us to the energy of MotherEarth that we connect to through the bottom of our feet. Visualize your feetplanted and united with the earth, and feel safe and supported.BREATH TWOImage [../images/00004.jpeg]Now extend your arms above your head and spread them until you create a V shape,as if they were forming an upside-down pyramid that points to your heart.Imagine yourself on top of a beautiful mountain, surrounded by an expansive,unlimited, star-filled sky.As you breathe in, visualize bringing the breath in through the top of yourhead, through the brain, face, neck, shoulders, upper back, and chest, and thenrelease your breath through the heart, again with a powerful sigh.The second breath works to release stresses and stagnant energy held in theupper body, including the mind. This breath asks us to surrender what we cannotcontrol and opens our ability to accept guidance and ask for help. It bonds usto the energy of the Divine Father (often referred to in Native American cultureas Father Sky).BREATH THREEImage [../images/00005.jpeg]The third breath integrates the first two breaths and balances our masculine(Father Sky) and feminine (Mother Earth) energies through the heart. When youinhale with your hands on your heart, visualize this breath coming IN throughthe heart and OUT through the heart, and release it with a powerful sigh.Remember, in all three breaths we should be releasing on the exhale with apowerful sigh. The sigh acts as a sound catalyst to release the energy.After you have tried this three-breath process several times, place your handson your heart and continue to gently breathe in and out. Hear or feel yourheartbeat. Listen to your breath. Let your inner music sing to you. . . . Inthis relaxed state, allow yourself to simply be.The Heart Song Breathing Process has been invaluable for me as a type-A nativeNew Yorker involved in the music industry for twenty-five years, helping memanage my daily stresses and form a deeper connection with my heart.Another benefit of practicing the Heart Song Breathing Process is the calmingeffect it has on the body.

We know theseemotional states can enhance our mental state and our spiritual connection, butthey also affect our physical health. Let's look at music's role in taking usthere!"},{"pageContent":"UNDERSTANDING COHERENCE AND ITS ROLE IN HEALTHCoherence occurs when the many aspects of our four bodies (mental, physical,spiritual, and emotional) all come together in harmony to work toward ouroptimal health. For example, think of the many sections of the orchestra as yourbody systems. If the violins decided to play at one speed, the flutes atanother, and the horns at a third, and all of them were playing whatever notesthey wanted, what you would hear would likely be incoherent, fragmented, anddissonant music. There has to be an agreed-upon tempo beforehand, a certain keyto play in, and communication between instruments. Each has its individual partto play, but there is a harmony that exists. That is how coherent andsynchronized music is made. The heart, as the drummer in the orchestra, has theability to provide a smooth, steady rhythm that the body can synchronize to. Theheart must also communicate to the individual systems (digestive, nervous, etc.)effectively.Our emotions are the conductor of our orchestra. Research has shown that when weare experiencing positive emotions such as gratitude, kindness, compassion, andjoy, we are producing smooth, orderly, synchronized rhythms (coherence). When weare experiencing negative emotions such as anger or frustration, we areproducing non-orderly, fragmented rhythms (incoherence).Positive emotions have also been proven to increase our heart rate variability,which in turn can improve our ability to adapt to physical, emotional, andenvironmental stresses.1 [part0028.html#fn.001]Heart rate variability measures how our heart rhythms change from beat to beat.Imagine that during a piece of music the conductor leads the orchestra to changetempos at various parts of the musical piece. When there is smooth, orderlycommunication (coherence), the orchestra can adapt to the changes easily. Whenthere is fragmentation, or disjointed communication (incoherence), it is moredifficult to adapt to stressful situations and our body and our health pay theprice. The more positive and elevated the emotions, the smoother and moreorderly the heart rhythms, and the better our heart and other systems can adaptand cope with stress.The Institute of HeartMath defines coherence in the following way:Heart coherence, marked by . . . smooth and balanced heart rhythms, is theoptimal state for your heart, mind and emotions and all of the processes in yourbody, including cognitive, hormonal, digestive, respiratory and immune systems.The empowering part is that we can have an active role in creating heartcoherence and improving our health. As we bring more focus and attention to ourheart, we open the path to living a more heart-centered life. Music can be theultimate mentor in teaching you how to gain access to the doorway of your heart."},{"pageContent":"THE ROLE OF MUSIC IN COHERENCEMusic can play a major role in creating a coherent state because of itseffortless power to provide a constant, smooth rhythm and to evoke positiveemotions. Our hearts have the ability to adapt and synchronize to the tempo of apiece of music. When the internal rhythm of our heart adapts to the externalrhythm of the music, this is called entrainment. On average our hearts are at arelaxed state between 60 and 70 beats per minute (bpm). When we listen tosoothing, calm music with a beat of around 60 bpm, our heartbeat (internalrhythm) synchronizes to the music (external rhythm) and we can move to a relaxedstate. This is part of our heart's unique intelligence, its ability tounderstand and adapt to the language that music is speaking.An interesting study has shown that listening to a metronome with a steady beatof 66 bpm can be more effective in reducing anxiety than sitting in silence.2[part0028.html#fn.002]I have applied this same methodology of creating this slower, steady tempo in myown music and have had amazing results in assisting people to reach thesecoherent states where anxiety is reduced.One of the benefits of coherence is that when we are in this state, our body ismore able to care for and heal itself. The important and powerful bottom line ofthis is that music can support our bodies to move into this state of repair,detoxification, and rejuvenation. When you combine music with a steady, smooth,orderly rhythm of about 60 bpm, it can create the same results as the metronomestudy. Even if this rhythm is subtle and underlying, such as in relaxationmusic, it is amazing that our internal drum (our heart) and our breath cansynchronize to external rhythms. This can induce coherent states where ourbodies can become more resilient and we are able to adapt to our daily stressesmore effectively.I have testimonials of this in extreme situations, such as delivering a childinto the world, where the mother was able to keep her body and mind in acoherent state by adapting her breath to the tempo of my music."},{"pageContent":"A NEWBORN'S CONNECTION WITH “THE HEART”Evelyn Simmons, a certified nurse-midwife, reported that at a recent conferenceshe was facilitating for midwives, one of the attendees brought her two-week-oldbaby who, as expected, was experiencing some fussiness over the course of thetwo-day convention. During this time, she put on “The Heart” from my CD seriesAmbiology (a piece of music composed at 60 bpm). The facilitator explained thatthe tempo of this piece of music was designed to create optimal relaxation andentrainment with the heart of both mother and child, and asked the mother to usethe vibration and rhythm of the music to connect their hearts. Moments later,while the room was in a deeply relaxed and meditative state, the facilitatornoticed something amazing: the baby was no longer fussing! Instead, the childwas lying with her belly on her mother's arm, her eyes wide open in wonder andpeace. Her arms were moving in sync with the rhythm of the music. When the musicwas turned off, the baby began to fuss again, but calmed once more almostimmediately after the music resumed.This demonstrates how easily we can entrain our heartbeat to beneficial temposto promote peace and relaxation. Even the two-week-old infant was able to relaxas her heart synced to the rhythm of the music. If entraining the heart withmusic can help a fussy two-week-old, imagine how helpful this could be indealing with stress factors in your own life! As our internal clock (our heart)adapts to the external clock (the music), we are gently guided to a state ofrelaxation. This process of our internal clock synchronizing with an externalclock is entrainment in action."},{"pageContent":"EMOTIONS AND HEART COHERENCELike music, emotions carry a specific vibration. When we allow ourselves toexperience the energy of gratitude, kindness, compassion, joy, love, and otherpositive, elevated emotions, our four bodies can move into resonance and harmonywith these emotions, which in turn creates more balance in our health andimproves our quality of life. These emotions then create a shared, coherentfield that is projected from our heart outwardly. I define a shared emotionalfield as the emotions and energy of an individual being felt beyond him- orherself. We have all experienced this before in one way or another. Imagineyou're at an event like the Super Bowl, where you can feel the cumulative energyof all the fans. That energetic feeling is produced by the cumulative emotionsof the group. This is a shared field. We can also do this individually.Have you ever walked into a room with someone and felt that the other person wasin a bad mood even before they said anything? We are tapping into their emotionsin the shared field. Fortunately, the opposite of this is true. We can tap intopositive aspects of the shared field as well.Music is a powerful tool in creating these shared and individual fields becauseof its innate ability to carry emotion and intention. For example, if you listento the same piece of music played by two different musicians, it is likely thatone will appeal to you more than the other. This is not because the music itselfis any different, but because you are picking up on the musician's emotions andintention behind the music. The emotions that come through music create a sharedfield with the listeners in the same way being at the Super Bowl creates ashared field of excitement.By listening to specific musical pieces that contain positive emotions, you cancreate the emotional resonance that you desire, be it peace, gratitude, joy, orexuberance. From this field, you can share those elevated emotions to positivelyaffect yourself and the people in your life, all from carefully choosing andentraining to the music that contains those emotions!Emotion and intention are the secret ingredients in creating a powerful musicalexperience. It's like Grandma's meatball recipe. You can follow the recipe linefor line, but something just doesn't taste the same. It's all the love Grandmaput into it, seeing and feeling everyone enjoying her meatballs even beforeanyone ate them. All of that went into the bowl, not just the ingredients. Musicis the same. Love is always the secret ingredient!In addition, research shows that specific types of music can affect our hearthealth. Classical and meditation music benefit cardiovascular health most, withheavy metal and techno having the least benefit. Blood pressure can also bealtered according to the type of music being listened to. Classical music(Mozart) lowered blood pressure, while rock music (Queen) brought blood pressureup.3 [part0028.html#fn.003]Taking this to the next level, music can be designed by composers with specifictempos and embedded with positive emotions. The end result is that listeners canbenefit by moving from states of stress where their overall heart health iscompromised to more positive emotional states where relaxation and rejuvenationoccur and health can improve.The next story shows how this new “designer music” can create a coherent fieldthat others can tap into to also create the beneficial coherent state we havediscussed."},{"pageContent":"SHARED FIELDS AND DESIGNER MUSICWhen I set out to write my album The Heart Codes, it was with the intention thatI would use my insight into heart coherence, music, and entrainment to helpothers. I wanted this intention to be felt within my music (like an added secretingredient!), so I created an intention for the start of each specific recordingsession. For example: “My intention is that the music I am creating assists thelistener in forming a deeper connection with their heart.” Prior to touching thekeyboard, I made sure that my emotions were aligned with my intention, and, ifnecessary, I would perform the Heart Song Breathing Process to bring my emotionsinto alignment.Part of my process is always connecting with the field around me when I create.In this field there are unlimited possibilities, soul-touching melodies, andotherworldly harmonies. A shift occurs in which I move from being the composerto actually being composed in collaboration with a higher power beyond myself.As I become aligned, I tap into the field of all possibilities. I feel warmth inmy heart and know when it is time to begin.While composing The Heart Codes, I would begin to play and could feel my heartslow down and entrain to 60 bpm (the tempo my metronome was set to). I feltmyself moving to a very relaxed, almost meditative state. I felt completely insync with the music that was flowing through me. It was almost as if the musicwas playing me. I felt a strong sense of beauty, peace, and love all around meand within me. That's when I heard a knock on the door, and my fiancée Donese(whose picture should be under the definition of type A) asked me to lower thevolume. The music was taking her to a deep state of calm and relaxation, and itwas making it difficult for her to work.I decided to work with my headphones on, but as I moved back into my meditative,relaxed state and the music began to flow through me, I again heard a knock onthe door. Even though she couldn't hear the music, Donese could feel her heartsynchronizing to the relaxed and blissful state! I was experiencing coherencethrough the music that I was creating (as was my intention). My intentionaligned with my emotions, harmonics, and frequencies, and it had created afield. This field was being shared with Donese even when she was in another roomand could not hear the music!It felt as though the field that was created from the composition was in harmonywith a larger field. After The Heart Codes was released, many people told methey felt the music and the emotion in every cell of their body. In this statethey were able to form a more intimate relationship with their heart. Theyexperienced the shared field within the music, and it allowed them to reach amore coherent, rejuvenating state. This field was designed by my intention,sparked by the emotion, and carried by the harmonics and the specificfrequencies of the music. Thinking about how we can design music to create morecoherent states physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually is veryexciting. What is even more exciting is that by improving our individual states,we affect a larger field around us and have an active role in improving ourworld!Each piece of music or each song that helps you transform negative emotions topositive ones takes you one step closer to knowing your heart on a deeper leveland tapping into its limitless powers.In addition to listening to music, taking a more participatory role can also bea great tool for healing. A great example of this is singing. When we sing, weare orchestrating a breathing pattern in conjunction with the singing. It isbased on the tempo of the song and the phrases sung. When we sing together, ourhearts can entrain to similar patterns and can move to smooth, orderly, coherentheart rhythms and improve heart rate variability.4 [part0028.html#fn.004]If you have ever listened to a powerful gospel choir, I am sure you haveexperienced the shared field of elevated emotions not just in the choir but inthe whole church. When you leave in this elevated state, how does it affect therest of your day and all you come in contact with?Music is beyond doubt a powerful vehicle that communicates and affects ourhearts through our deepest trials and tribulations. Even when the brain is notfunctioning well, music can communicate to our hearts. In a recent study,Mahler's “Symphony No. 2,” an uplifting and high-energy piece, was played to acomatose patient for fourteen days. Although the patient did not come out of thecoma, his heart rate variability increased throughout the period when music wasplayed, a sign of overall heart health and of the further adaptability of theheart, even in a patient who was not conscious. So, although the brain was notfunctioning in its normal state, music still communicated to the heart andimproved the overall health of the patient.5 [part0028.html#fn.005]The bottom line is that we can utilize music to entrain to more orderly heartrhythms and elevate to more positive emotions. This, in turn, can increase ourheart rate variability, which has a host of physical, emotional, and mentalbenefits: * Less risk for stress-related illnesses, such as cardiac problems * Improved cognitive abilities * Enhanced immune function * Less anxiety * A stronger sense of inner peaceIt is said that the heart has a mind of its own, yet our heart and brain are inconstant communication. The Institute of HeartMath says it beautifully:The heart and brain maintain a continuous two-way dialogue, each influencing theother's functioning. The signals the heart sends to the brain can influenceperception, emotional processing and higher cognitive functions. This system andcircuitry is viewed by neurocardiology researchers as a “heart brain.”Now that we've discussed how music engages the heart, in the next chapter wewill take a deeper look at how music also engages the brain, resulting inhealthier and more coherent physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual bodies."},{"pageContent":"SOUND TOOLS FOR TRANSFORMATION 1.

It is probably one of the most significant bonding experiences youwill ever witness. Outside of it being an emotional experience, it is also aphysical experience. One reason for this is a hormone related to bonding calledoxytocin. The “cuddle hormone,” as it's sometimes called, can be released bysinging.7 [part0028.html#fn.007] No wonder music is such a profound emotionalexperience for both mother and child!In addition, research indicates that music assists in producing an array ofother beneficial molecules in our biological pharmacy. Listening to music cancreate peak emotions, which increase the amount of dopamine, a specificneurotransmitter that is produced in the brain and helps control the brain'sreward and pleasure centers.8 [part0028.html#fn.008]We often feel emotions are experienced from our heart, but an enormous part ofemotional stimulus is communicated through the brain. Our newfound understandingof how music engages the brain and heart is leading to innovative ways toutilize music to create emotional understanding. A study from the Journal ofMusic Therapy shows that using songs as a form of communication could increaseemotional understanding in autistic children. The study incorporated specificsongs to portray different emotions. For example, a composition by Beethovencould be used to represent sadness, or the song “Happy” by Pharrell Williamscould be used to represent joy. The children could then indicate and identifyemotions based on the songs that represented them. Music succeeded where verballanguage failed. Music was able to bridge the brain and heart.9[part0028.html#fn.009]Music evokes and engages our emotions in many stages of our lives bothindividually and in groups. Music can evoke the deepest emotions and help usprocess fear, grief, sadness, and resentment, even if these emotions are held ona subconscious level.MEMORYImagine an elderly man in a wheelchair. His head droops down to his chest,almost in a state of unconsciousness. His name is Henry and, sadly, he isdisconnected from the world around him due to severe Alzheimer's. What mightreconnect him to the world and improve his awareness?The movie Alive Inside chronicles how music can assist in regaining parts ofmemory and improve the quality of life of Alzheimer's patients. One of thecaretakers in Henry's nursing home interviews his family to find out the type ofmusic Henry used to enjoy listening to before Alzheimer's affected him. Bycreating playlists incorporating music specifically for Henry, the caretakerhelps Henry reconnect with the world around him. His eyes open, he is aware, andhe is able to communicate. He was reconnected to his life from the music—hismusic.A 2009 study from Petr Janata at the University of California, Davis found thatthere is a part of the brain that “associates music and memories when weexperience emotionally salient episodic memories that are triggered by familiarsongs from our personal past.”10 [part0028.html#fn.010] In other words, our ownfamiliar music can reconnect us with deep, meaningful memories from our past,like it did in Henry's case.These principles are what we will use later to form the basis of specificallyconstructed playlists to evoke certain emotional responses that we wish toproduce.LEARNING AND NEUROPLASTICITYNeuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming newneural connections throughout life. According to MedicineNet.com[http://MedicineNet.com], “Neuroplasticity allows the neurons (nerve cells) inthe brain to compensate for injury and disease and to adjust their activities inresponse to new situations or to changes in their environment.”11[part0028.html#fn.011]To further clarify, when our brain is damaged, it can find or create newpathways to function properly. Amazingly, music can provide the stimuli tocreate these new pathways and to help the brain rewire itself in the case ofbrain injury. For instance, in a groundbreaking study by the University ofNewcastle in Australia, popular music was used to assist patients with severebrain injuries in recalling personal memories. The music helped the patients toreconnect to memories they previously could not access.It's like getting directions to a location. If a road is closed, or you arestuck in traffic, there is sometimes an alternate route to get to the sameplace. Music can help map that alternate route!A great example of this is shown in the case of former congresswoman GabrielleGiffords. Congresswoman Giffords experienced a brain injury as the result of agunshot wound, which affected her language center and left her almost unable tospeak. By engaging her brain through music therapy, singing, and melodicintonation, she was able to provide new information to the brain through musicand create a reorganization that helped her to make the connections necessary torelearn language.This is an extreme case, but many of us have experienced some kind ofneuroplasticity in our normal lives. Neuroplasticity, simply put, is our brain'sability to repair connections and find alternate pathways to memories, emotions,and even physical systems such as speech—and utilizing music is a wonderful wayto achieve this.ATTENTIONEver hear a song that engages you so profoundly it takes hold of your fullattention? By engaging our brain and our attention in the right ways, music isable to activate, sustain, and improve our attention.Using brain images of people listening to short symphonies by an obscureeighteenth-century composer, a research team from the Stanford University Schoolof Medicine investigated the power that music has to hold our attention andshowed that peak brain activity occurred during a short period of silencebetween musical movements—when seemingly nothing was happening. This lead theresearchers to theorize that listening to music could help the brain toanticipate events and hold greater attention, just as the listeners demonstratedwhen they seemed to pay closest attention during the anticipatory silencesbetween musical movements.My theory is that these silences are indeed part of each composer's intention toguide the listener in interpreting and integrating the music. It is the spacebetween the notes that captivates our full attention and allows the busy mind tocommunicate and integrate with the heart. It is in these silences, where ourfocus is total and complete, that true balance and healing can occur, as ourbrain and heart move into coherence.On the other hand, we have all experienced how certain types of music candistract us or make us inattentive to tasks at hand. This makes complete sense.Unlike the attentive silences of the previous study, some songs can negativelyengage our attention, as we become part of the song's story or scene. Lyrics aredescriptive and engage our analytical mind, which could divide our attention.As we move forward in the following chapters, you will be encouraged to becomean expert on using music to access targeted states. You will learn how to usemusic as a bridge to shift moods, relax, increase your focus, and gainmotivation. What's exciting is that you can assist your heart and brain as theymove to more balanced and synchronized states using music, sound, and vibration!"},{"pageContent":"WAYS TO ENGAGE THE BRAIN USING MUSICNow that we have seen some of the ways that music engages the brain, let's learnhow we can take a role in implementing some of these benefits into activeprocesses.PLAY AN INSTRUMENTMusical improvisation, which is a spontaneous creative idea, is a perfectexample of how music utilizes both sides of the brain. Our technical skills areutilized to play the instrument and affect the left side of the brain, while thenew creative ideas or improvisation flowing through us affect the right side. Inaddition, we are tapping into the power of our hearts by embedding the musicwith our emotion. On a spiritual level, when I improvise I always feel like theideas are flowing through me in collaboration and connection with a larger fieldand something outside myself. If you want to engage both your brain and heartwith music, improvise! This practice is not limited to just musicians; I haveseen many a friend make up his or her own words to songs on karaoke night!This skill of improvising can also be applied in different areas of our lives tofind creative solutions and improve cognitive abilities and spontaneous thought,which in turn can assist with the challenges we face in our daily lives.SINGIn addition to singing having beneficial effects for our heart, it also affectsour brain as well. Keep in mind that it's about the act of singing itself, nothow well you sing! Some studies have demonstrated that singing (even badsinging!) provides emotional, social, and cognitive benefits.12[part0028.html#fn.012] In addition, in later chapters we will show how music canbe used to improve speech function and decrease stress, anxiety, and depression.CHANTFor thousands of years, chanting has been used as a vehicle to form a deeperspiritual connection. This is especially true of the sound om, which is said tocontain every sound in the universe within it. As we chant om, we can releasemind chatter and our focus shifts to a deeper spiritual connection. But chantingalso benefits our physical body as well as our spiritual one!A pioneering study revealed that chanting the word om could engage the area ofthe brain that is associated with calmness and a sense of inner peace. fMRIs(functional MRIs) were used to scan the brain while people chanted differentsounds and syllables, including ssss and om. While chanting the sound of ssssshowed no benefit, chanting om activated the area of the brain associated with asense of peacefulness.13 [part0028.html#fn.013]DRUMResearch indicates that specific beats can induce different brain wavefrequencies and can induce a deeply relaxed state.14 [part0028.html#fn.014]Other studies show that participation in group drumming led to significantimprovements in many aspects of social-emotional behavior.15[part0028.html#fn.015]The potential of the benefits of drumming on the brain is leading to someamazing collaborations. Mickey Hart, former drummer of the Grateful Dead, pairedwith neuroscientist Dr. Adam Gazzaley in hopes of gaining a deeper understandingof how music directly affects different brain wave states and how it may helpspecific brain conditions. Dr. Gazzaley measured Hart's brain wave activity ashe played at concerts. Hart led a drum circle of over a thousand people. Itdemonstrated the natural power of group rhythmic entrainment, and their findingssupported recent studies that indicated how playing a musical instrument canstrengthen and exercise the aging brain. We'll discuss the benefits of drummingmore later on."},{"pageContent":"BRAIN WAVE ENTRAINMENTAnother powerful way to engage the brain with music, sound, and vibration isthrough brain wave entrainment. Although this section gets a bit heady (excusethe pun), I invite you to stick with me and embrace your inner geek.Heart entrainment, discussed in the previous chapter, shows how the internalrhythm of our heart can synchronize to the external rhythm of music to createmore orderly, beneficial heart rhythms. But music can also entrain the brain tomore relaxed states, where we become more focused and attentive and can increaseour cognitive abilities, sleep more soundly, and learn to meditate.While heart entrainment is based upon synchronizing the heartbeat to specifictempos, or beats per minute, brain entrainment is based on the brainsynchronizing to specific frequencies, which are measured in hertz (Hz).Specific frequencies induce different states in our brain:Image [../images/00006.jpeg]During our active day most of us are in beta states. We are moving at a fasterpace when our attention is on our outer world (work, family, etc.), and ourfaster brain frequencies reflect this. As we move to more relaxed brain wavestates, we become calmer. We can induce the alpha state by closing our eyes,breathing slower, and listening to calming music.As we travel into an even deeper state of relaxation, we move into a theta brainwave state. This can occur through meditation and also through relaxation music.It is in alpha and theta states that we tap into enhanced creative frames ofmind. As our bodies progress into deep sleep, we are in delta and our brainwaves have fully slowed down.Music is a delivery system of frequency. Each note has a specific frequency, butwe can also embed additional brain wave frequencies outside of the standardnotes into music to allow the brain to entrain to our desired states.When our internal brain waves synchronize to the external brain wave frequenciesthat are contained in the music, this is called brain wave entrainment. Forinstance, if I were looking to move into a very creative state, I would utilizemusic that contains alpha and theta frequencies. If I have insomnia, I mightincorporate music that contains delta frequencies.There are many technologies that are used to induce and target the differentbrain frequencies, including binaural beats, isochronic beats, monaural beats,and many more. Each type could have its own chapter. I invite you to investigatethe pros and cons of them all and see which ones resonate with you. In addition,I am creating my own delivery system called adaptive music, which utilizesspecific harmonics to accommodate the different targeted brain states.An amazing amount of research has been done to prove the benefits of music onthe brain, but we've only just scratched the surface. There is so muchexcitement and potential around integrating music as a transformative pathway toheal and improve our brains. I am thrilled to be working with Dr. Daniel Amen,who is a double board-certified adult and child psychiatrist, author, andresearcher. We will be conducting exciting new research to determine how mymusic may provide supportive benefits to the brain and to determine how tocreate and influence positive changes by selecting specific pieces of music toimprove brain function.I have also had the privilege of working with Dr. Joe Dispenza, a researcher,lecturer, and author, and have composed live music to accompany his meditationswith over five hundred attendees at each workshop. During these powerfulmeditations, a group of participants was studied using EEG brain mappingtechnology to determine specific brain activity. The research showed peoplereached very coherent brain wave states in a very short period of time duringthe meditations. It is amazing to see firsthand how music and meditation canhelp in moving people to beneficial brain states where transformation can occur.Knowing how to entrain both our hearts and our brains can lead us to a place oftrue synchronization, where our heart and mind are seamlessly connected inconstant communication through the music we listen to.At the end of the chapter, I have provided examples of the types of music thatinduce the different brain wave states to help you get started on your journeytoward your own brain entrainment exercises! As you become more familiar withthe frequencies that evoke specific responses within your brain, you should feelfree to branch out and find other pieces of music that can help you achievethese brain wave states.Imagine being able to utilize the power of both your brain and heart fortransformation and healing.

I love to listen to powerful instrumental music like that of Vangelis or epic soundtrack music. Moving to this brain state creates the potential for the production of beneficial hormones, neurotransmitters, and other molecules in your body. For example, after listening to music, serotonin levels can increase. Serotonin is involved in the sleep-wake cycle, mood, and the control of pain perception. * Choose a piece of familiar music to engage your memory.

My dad was a limousine driver foreighteen hours a day, six days a week for over twenty years. It's hard toimagine how many hours of music he listened to in a day to shift his mood, tokeep him awake, to allow him to nap for an hour. I can still hear his voicesaying with his slightly Jewish New York accent, “Now that's a song! When areyou gonna write a song like that?”He especially loved the line in Maggie Mae that referred to the characterstealing his father's pool stick and skipping school. I could feel his emotionsin the moment where he proudly sang that line louder than the others. It alwaystook him from his limousine back in time to that pool hall in Brooklyn where hespent many hours not only learning the game of pool but the game of life.I can almost smell the cigarettes in his car ashtray, the day-old coffee cups inthe holder, and the leather interior, mixing with Rod Stewart's voice and mydad's. I am there, right now in the limousine, and although my dad has passedon, he will always live in that song for me. “Maggie Mae,” courtesy of RodStewart, transformed my dad every time he heard it, providing about four minutesof joy in a long eighteen-hour day. For a few moments in that song, he was givena vehicle that transported him to a different space and time. All was still goodin that pool hall, surrounded by the love of his childhood buddies and the pieceof him that wished he could play hooky from those eighteen-hour days six days aweek, fifty-one weeks a year. It may seem small, but there are no smalltransformations; they are all miracles.Music defies time and embraces space. Just as it did for my dad, music takes usall back to grade school in an instant, to our first breakup, or to our walkdown the aisle. Songs give definition to our emotions and create the soundtrackof our lives. Music allows us a brief intermission in challenging times. Thisintermission allows our souls to rest, recuperate, and recharge our hearts. Asong may be just as powerful as a favorite movie or book that changed yourworldview."},{"pageContent":"THE MESSENGER: SONGA song can be a long-lost friend. Although you may not have communicated with itin years, when you do listen, it instantly transports you to another place andtime and evokes strong emotions. Song is a vehicle for the soul to releaseburdens and heavy energy. Creating movement to release our negative emotionssets the space for a shift to occur. These shifts in feelings can releaseemotional blocks, which in turn aid in our healing process. When we alter ouremotions, there can be a profound effect on the physical body. When we create achange in any of the four bodies—physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual—weare creating movement in at least one of the others. Songs move emotions,period.Let me give you an example. Think of a song like “Eleanor Rigby” by The Beatles.In this hauntingly beautiful two-minute song, John Lennon and Paul McCartneytake you through the lives of two lonely people, including a wedding and afuneral. The lives of these two people intertwine within the song, although weare not sure if they have ever physically met.Although we, as the listener, have never met them either, by the time the songis over we feel as though we know them through the amazing development of thecharacters. There is a “common chord” (excuse the pun) being struck within allof us. The haunting cellos and moving violins pull at our heartstrings and openour hearts. For less than three minutes we are in this song's scene, feeling thesadness and loneliness of the characters. This gives us a platform toacknowledge our own challenges with loneliness, and to use the compassion thesong activates toward ourselves. It creates an opportunity to heal.When we hear a song that resonates with us, it is amplifying something within usthat is already there and may need to be brought to the surface to explore,understand, and release from our heart. The song is a messenger from the soul,bringing awareness to these hidden emotions and blockages.Have you ever had a song come on at the perfect moment? These are soul messagesthat are inviting you to listen more deeply to what truths your spirit is tryingto convey.I remember going through a challenging time in my life, and whenever I wasquestioning my faith, “Angel” by Sarah McLachlan would come on. I remember thecomfort in those moments of knowing I was held and comforted by somethingoutside of myself that I could not explain. That song was my soul's messengerthat everything was going to be okay . . . I believed it and felt it, and itwas.Another song came as a message to my soul when I met my fiancée. For years,whenever someone would ask me what my favorite song was, I would answer, “CouldIt Be I'm Falling in Love” by The Spinners. It was a song that brought me backto a very happy time in my childhood. But in all my years as a musician andsongwriter, I have never had one person tell me that this was their favoritesong.One night, early on in our relationship, Donese and I were having a conversationon the phone and I asked her what her favorite song was. When she answered“Could It Be I'm Falling in Love” by The Spinners, I nearly fell off my chair. Ididn't think she would believe me when I told her it was my favorite song aswell. In that moment, it was a message to both of us that this obscure 1970srecord was a sign that we were two pieces of a puzzle meant to fit together.In addition to being the soul's messenger, song has also been used as amessenger between individuals and groups of people.African American slaves used music to boost their spirit individually and ingroups, and certain songs also became a way to relay secret messages. “Wade inthe Water,” for instance, contains messages of how to avoid bloodhounds. Anothersong, “Follow the Drinking Gourd,” provided details to slaves of an escape routefrom Mississippi and Alabama to Canada.16 [part0028.html#fn.016]In these examples, music was not only used as a soul messenger to keep spiritsand hopes alive, but also as a powerful interpersonal messenger—one that helpedto save lives.Songs move us beyond the mind and take us directly to the core of our soul. Atthis deep level we can transmute and transform limited beliefs and negativefeelings and emotions. As we clean out emotions from our energetic closet thatno longer serve us, we can begin to truly listen to our heart and unveil thegifts that we are here to share. We all have a song in our heart that is waitingto be sung."},{"pageContent":"ORCHESTRATING YOUR HEART'S SONG IN THIS MOMENTIn 2004, I was captivated by Dr. Wayne Dyer's talk at a conference in Arizona. Istill remember the eight words he said: “Don't die with your music still inyou.” Wow. It went straight to my heart. While I was working at producing andcollaborating on other people's music every day, I put aside writing and singingmy own songs. Every time I would begin to sing my music, I would hear the voicesof my childhood buddies saying, “Dude, don't sing.” I listened to thosenaysaying voices for over twenty years.I decided in that moment of hearing Wayne Dyer speak, seemingly directly to me,that I was done listening to those negative voices. I made a commitment towrite, sing, and produce my first solo album. I didn't care if one personlistened to it; I was not about to die with my music still in me.I released my first solo album at the age of forty-four. In honor of the momentthat I committed to it, I called it The Moment. One year later, through a seriesof synchronicities, and my tenacious and heart-connected events manager SharonKelley, I was asked to open up for Wayne Dyer in Colorado. I sang the titlesong, “The Moment.” After my performance, he affectionately rubbed the top of myhead in approval and it felt as though my dad were blessing me from the otherside, saying, Son, I am proud of you!Inspiration creates inspiration. Once I released that limiting belief system of“Dude, don't sing,” I was supported by each step I took in moving forward. Smallsteps create large movement, and the universe blatantly responded.

Music was one of my parts.Like my ribs, my liver, my kidneys, my heart. Like my blood.It was a force already within me when I arrived on the scene.It was a necessity for me—like food or water.—Ray CharlesMY DAD AND MOM WERE MUSIC LOVERS. We had a ton of 45s and 33s (which were calledrecords for those of you under forty) in a variety of styles and genres. My dadeven worked for Mercury Records at one time. Although they encouraged memusically, the common chorus in my house was, “Music's a nice hobby, but whatare you going to do for a living?” When a verbal event is repeated frequentlyand is attached to an emotion, we begin to absorb it into our field and itcreates its own frequency. This frequency, when repeated enough times, creates avibration, or a belief system, centered around the original words.For years I carried my parents' belief that music was a nice hobby but it wouldnot sustain me financially. There was a part of me that did not believe inmyself 100 percent because subconsciously I did not believe my parents did. Thetruth is that they were passing on limited belief systems about lack of moneyand poverty that were passed down to them. I had fallen out of tune.Specific negative emotions can trigger limited belief systems, just as strikinga tuning fork can induce a piano to vibrate when it resonates with the samenote. In my case, situations that involved the energy of lack triggered orinduced emotions connected to my limited belief system that I was not capable ofmaking a living doing music. This subconsciously sabotaged my ability to moveforward with embracing music as a full-time career. When I finally became awareof this, I was able to make the decision that this inherited belief systemneeded to stop.It was time to shift the belief system and attune to a new vibration—and I hadthe perfect tool: music! I immersed myself in the songs of other musicians whohad overcome their obstacles to create success. Every time I listened to one oftheir songs, it became a vehicle to charge my passion and shift my limitedbeliefs. One of my favorites was Bruce Springsteen, who, like me, had grown upin a working-class neighborhood in the tristate area on the East Coast.Utilizing the power of song and experiencing musical successes allowed me toovercome my old patterning. What I realized was that creating music was notabout making a living; it was a powerful vehicle to assist me in creating anamazing life—the life that I wanted for myself. Once I achieved this amazinglife through music, the money naturally followed."},{"pageContent":"RE-TUNING OLD BELIEF SYSTEMSOur belief systems are similar to a piano. Just as pianos can go out of tune andthen be re-tuned, so can our belief systems. For example, if a piano has notbeen tuned in a long time, it becomes accustomed to being de-tuned. The tensionof the strings has changed, the relationship of the notes to each other is notoptimal, and the overtones are not harmonious. When we finally tune the pianoback to its optimal tuning, it tends to shift back to the old tension of beingde-tuned. It is used to being this way, and there is literally a pull to returnto the old way. We have all experienced the same sensation of de-tuning, orfalling out of alignment, and the pull of returning to our limited beliefsystems.Most of us come into the world connected and tuned to elevated emotions such aslove, appreciation, gratitude, and worthiness. Repetitive events trigger lowervibrational or negative emotions such as shame, guilt, resentment, etc., and webecome de-tuned from the elevated emotions contained in our original birthblueprint. Just like the piano, we can grow accustomed to not being tunedproperly. It becomes comfortable, and we forget our true potential or ouroptimal tuning.So how can we re-tune and maintain without falling back into old patterns andlimited belief systems? An excellent way to achieve this is by implementingsongs on a daily basis, which can keep us in tune and tapped into our fullestpotential.By frequently listening to a song with elevated emotions, you can shift yournegative emotions and limited belief system. The key is being present, trulyfeeling and becoming the emotion in the song and using it as a consistent dailytool."},{"pageContent":"IDENTIFYING YOUR MUSICAL PINNACLEMusic can never be taken away from us because it is embedded in us. As RayCharles said, music is a necessity. Even if we are not listening to music outloud, our brain remembers it and can access it. Right now, if I want to listento “ABC” by The Jackson 5, I can hear it in my mind. Not only can I hear it, Ican also feel it and it can transform my current emotional state.We all have a song in our memory banks that triggers joy. Some call it a “happysong”; I call it a musical pinnacle. It is a song that defines a specific periodin your life that you can go back to in an instant and feel the same emotion,usually a time when you were happy. As we discussed before, music cuts throughspace and time, and transports us to the moment or emotional memory we wish toobtain. Your musical pinnacle acts as a time machine to that specific emotionalmemory, and it ignites positive emotions in your heart's electromagnetic fieldand can produce beneficial hormones, chemicals, and molecules from your brain.An example of this would be that when we are experiencing intense pleasure fromlistening to music, it can lead to the release of dopamine.17[part0028.html#fn.017] Dopamine has a number of roles and functions in movement,memory, cognition, and behavior, and it helps control our brain's reward andpleasure centers.Just like Henry, the Alzheimer's patient, your musical pinnacle might be alifeline for you in a later period in your life. For Henry, music improved hislife by bringing him to an alive-aware state from a completely disconnected one.Music was a life-sparking bridge that transformed his state. Your musicalpinnacle, or your “happy song,” isn't just a way to create a momentary shift; itis an investment in your future health. As you practice with this song furtherand further, adding additional layers of happy or joyful emotional memories, itwill become easier and easier to reconnect with this song anytime you feelunhappy, disconnected, or out of touch."},{"pageContent":"BE THE DJ OF YOUR LIFEWhen you really take the time to understand the role of a great DJ, what they docan be truly amazing.

When youcome into the cocktail hour, the music is all about creating a safe, invitingspace. It's usually more intimate, with just acoustic guitar or piano music.Most of the time the music is instrumental, which gives the guests anopportunity to talk and get to know each other without having to shout over songlyrics. The tempo of the music is either mid or slow tempos to allow the gueststo begin to relax and get accustomed to the environment.As you move into the reception area, the music changes and the acousticinstrumentals are replaced by full songs. Drums, bass, saxophone, and vocals nowfill the space and bring energy, excitement, and fun. The music is a bit louderand faster and feels like it is preparing you for something. During dinner, themusic is at a lower volume and allows you to socialize but still continues tocreate a feel-good flow.After dinner, the master of ceremonies asks for the bride and her father tograce the dance floor with the first dance. They dance to the song, and thebride gently takes a tissue to her father's eye to wipe away a tear. There isnot a dry eye in the house. When the dance is over, the groom taps the father ofthe bride on the shoulder to cut in. The DJ starts playing the song“Celebration” by Kool & The Gang, and everybody is up and going crazy. For thenext hour the music gets louder, faster, and more exciting as it creates aclimax to an amazing event.In just a few hours, you were relaxed, emotionally touched, and excited. Inaddition, your physical body was affected at all of the stages. Music played apowerful and primary role in creating the energetic map for your journey. Thiswas no accident. The DJ knew exactly what songs would work at what times.Imagine taking some of the same principles and applying them to your own life tocreate an energetic road map to amazing events every day!So now it's your turn to become the DJ of your life. Our first step to usingmusic as a vehicle is to map out where you want to go and how to get there.PLAYLIST PROTOCOLSFor our purposes, a playlist is a compilation of songs you put together tocreate a specific mood, emotion, or energetic outcome. Before MP3s, before CDs,there were jukeboxes where we put in coins and picked records we wanted to hearto create a mood. Now we have the ability to download songs, import them intoour library, and create mixes by simply dragging them into a new playlist. Ifthis is sounding foreign to you and you are a bit more old-school, you cancreate your list with pen and paper and play the songs on your list from yourCDs or records, eight-tracks, or cassette tapes.There are a few things to consider that will enhance your listening experienceand help you in bringing awareness to your musical preferences, which determinesyour experience. These tips will also help you begin to differentiate betweenhearing and listening. When we hear something we are merely having a sonicexperience. When we listen, we open ourselves up to being affected on a mental,emotional, physical, and spiritual multisensory adventure.VOLUMEHow loud you listen to music plays a major role in determining your experiencein all types of music. Find a comfortable listening level based on theexperience you are looking to have according to your playlist.For relaxing music, I recommend listening at low volumes to encourage arelaxation response.Volume for your inspirational playlist will differ from your relaxation list. Inthis case, you might want to get up and dance and really feel the music. Themusic might be a little louder to accommodate that. It's all about what feelsgood to you. Find your comfort zone. Obviously, if disturbing others is aconcern, consider listening with headphones or inviting them to join in.TEMPOTempo is the speed at which a song is played and is related to bpm, or beats perminute. We discussed bpm and tempo at length in our discussion of heartentrainment; now it's time to put that knowledge to good use!What is the energetic flow you want to create in your playlist? If you are usinga playlist to start your day, you might want it to go from slow to fast so youcan ease into the experience and then create more energetic movement. If you aremaking a playlist for the end of the day, the reverse might be true: you want tomove the music from faster to slower tempos. If you are listening to a play-listin the middle of the day to relieve stress and calm down, you might want thetempo to be consistent, staying at the same bpm. In general, slow songs areusually between 40 and 70 bpm. Medium tempo songs are between 75 and 115 bpm,and fast songs are 120 bpm and up. If you want to find out the bpm of a song,you can go to www.tempotap.com [http://www.tempotap.com]. Tap along with anysong using the space bar to find the bpm!GENREWhen you are compiling songs for your playlists, ask yourself if the genre isconducive to the intention of the playlist. If you are creating a relaxationplaylist, most of us will not choose heavy metal music for this purpose. Gothrough your current library of music—many times the genres are listed if youare using iTunes. If not, YouTube has playlists for many different genres.Listen to and familiarize yourself with the different feel of each genre so youcan create a guideline of how to utilize them in your playlists. This will alsobetter acquaint you with genres that you normally don't listen to but mightenjoy. Push yourself out of the box a bit and make it a fun adventure.RHYTHMRhythm is a repeated pattern of movement or sound accented by short and longnotes. The rhythmical accents can evoke a certain mood. If you are creating asensual playlist, using a slow salsa rhythm or Afro-Cuban rhythm can be quiteeffective because they are very dynamic. If you are creating an exerciseplaylist, club or dance music, with its steady, driving rhythm, can motivateyour movement. If you are looking for music for a romantic dinner, the smoothrhythm in your favorite jazz album might work wonderfully. Experiment, listen todifferent rhythms of musical pieces that you love, and see what moods areevoked. Take notes so you can come back and incorporate the themes into yourspecific playlists. You can use many genres with different rhythms all in oneplaylist to evoke a targeted emotion.MELODYRemember the game show “Name That Tune”? What people were using to correctlyguess the name of the song was the melody. Melody is the part of the song youcan hum or whistle even without the words.“Beat It” by Michael Jackson is a perfect example of how a melody can continueto be resonant with people years after the song is originally released. DJsstill play that song to get people out of their seats thirty years later becausethe melodic pattern from the bass line is programmed in most of our subconsciousmemories and makes us feel good. Some other great examples are “Rock Around theClock” by Bill Haley & His Comets, “Sweet Caroline” from Neil Diamond, “PianoMan” by Billy Joel, or “Shake It Off” by Taylor Swift.There are times when we might not necessarily want a lot of melody in a musicalpiece. Music for sleep is one example. When listening to sleep music, we don'twant a lot of melody because it can tend to put us into our analytical mind of“I like that melody” or “I don't like that melody.” Simple, longer tones withless melody work much better to wind us down, and they don't create what I callearworms (a song that won't leave your mind). Think about the theme song fromJeopardy—that is an earworm! Now try to get it out of your mind. . . .LYRICSLyrics are the words in a song. When creating your playlists, consider whetheryou want songs with lyrics or not. Typically, in relaxation music, full lyricalcontent that tells a specific story can be distracting, although chanting, whichhas fewer words and more sounds, can be very conducive to eliciting a relaxationresponse. Words carry energy, and we listen to songs with words in a more activeway because we feel the need to decipher their meaning.Lyrics can also trigger specific emotions. Sometimes lyrics can inspire andignite us or bring us to tears. They also can create a multisensory experience.As we tap into the scenes within the song's words, they evoke our senses.Sometimes repeating lyrics can help reprogram and clear negative emotions, andsometimes they can take us to a very vulnerable state. Make sure you use lyricsto take you to your intended state, rather than one you're not ready to explore.As you're composing your playlists, take a minute to look up or listen closelyto the lyrics in the songs so you won't be triggered by a phrase that takes youto an unintended emotional state.FREQUENCIESAs a music producer, I always think creating a song is like building a house outof frequencies. The lower frequencies, bass and low drums, create the foundationfor the house. They are the lowest part of the house, usually the part thatconnects to the earth. Your mid frequencies are like the walls of the house.Guitars, keyboards, synthesizers, and vocals start in this range. Your highfrequencies are like the roof of the house. They are shakers, cymbals, and thehigher end of the vocal and guitar range.These frequencies can also work in a beneficial way and have a spiritualcontext. The lower tones tend to ground us, so if you are feeling scattered orunfocused, listening to music that has a good amount of bass can make you feelmore present. Midrange instruments, such as the hand drums in Native Americancultures, are used to clear energy around the body. Listening to higherfrequencies tends to connect us more with the ethereal, and breathy tones aregreat for clearing mind chatter and opening up our intuition and spiritualconnection. As we discussed in chapter 3 [part0012_split_001.html#c03],utilizing specific frequencies can help you induce and entrain to particularbrain states. Use the brain waves chart in chapter 3[part0012_split_001.html#c03] as a quick reference guide for embeddedfrequencies.CHORDS/MODESWhen we play different notes together they create chords. Different chords, ormodes, can create different emotional experiences. Minor chords can make youfeel sad, contemplative, and retrospective, while major chords can make you feelhappy, confident, and inspired. Here are some basic emotions that are associatedwith different chords or modes: * Major chords—confident, happy, elevated, inspired, extraverted * Minor chords—sad, somber, introspective * Diminished chords—ominous, haunting, spooky * Suspended chords—tense, anticipatory * Augmented 9th chords—dramatic, very present * Major 7th chords—dreamy, sensualYou probably have experienced all of the above listed modes, although you maynot know the particular names of the chords that were played. You really don'tneed to. Listen to the feelings that the music evokes in you and see if it issteering you in the direction you want to go.Keeping these playlist protocols in mind will help as you begin to design newplaylists. When we can truly listen to the music within, as discussed in chapter1 [part0010_split_001.html#c01], it deepens our experience of recorded and livemusic. When the external music resonates with the internal music (the heartbeat,the breath, and the sigh), the seed of transformation is nurtured. Listening canbe an adventure; and where adventure is invited, transformation awaits!"},{"pageContent":"SOUND TOOLS FOR TRANSFORMATIONHere are some powerful suggestions for implementing some of this chapter'sconcepts to create transformation in your life right now. * Is there a belief system that has been holding you back from something?

We were living in a quiet section of Queens at the time, and ourneighborhood was primarily Jewish. Co-op City in the Bronx was conversely amelting pot of all cultures. With thirty-five buildings in a two-and-a-half-mileradius, it was quite different from Queens. By the time I was twelve, I hadstarted playing guitar and writing songs about everything. My friends werepretty supportive, but I was teased a bit about creating “musical records” ofsome not-so-proud moments in their lives. (A song about stealing a school buscould be a bit incriminating.)I learned early that songs were a way to immortalize significant events, lifelessons, and special moments. I began to listen to some great songwriters of thetime such as Elton John, The Rolling Stones, and many more. What was trulyamazing was that our neighborhood park, which we called Pebble Lounge, becamethe sounding board for my friends and I to stick our toes into the diversemusical waters surrounding us. With Joe's boom box by our side, each of us wouldhave about a half hour to share a mixtape of our favorite songs. Mixtapes wereour playlists in the 1970s. Spending an evening at Pebble Lounge was liketasting from a smorgasbord of music. Everything from salsa by Tito Puente andCelia Cruz to Crosby, Stills & Nash, The Grateful Dead, The Doors, ElvisCostello, The Sugarhill Gang, Bruce Springsteen, Bob Marley, and so many more.The ethnic diversity of growing up in Co-op City provided me with music lessonsthat could not be taught in a classroom.Every mixtape came with explanations and insights from the person who createdit. It was incredible how every song had its own effect on each of us. Sometimesthey affected us differently, sometimes similarly; but the songs always took ussomewhere.Music for us was more than just an escape. In some instances, music acted as acoping mechanism for some very difficult situations that were going on in ourfamilies. Music was a way to feel and vent every emotion from anger to lovewithout harming anyone. Listening to our mixtapes was a way to lighten theemotional load that each of us was carrying, and really one of the only toolsoutside of sports that we had at that time as kids.It was in these moments, exploring music at Pebble Lounge, that I learned musicis a vehicle that can take us from one place to another, from dark to light,transforming us as we travel.Although mixtapes have now shifted to playlists, the concept is still the same.In this chapter, we will create playlists that take us to specific positiveemotions or moods. I usually start with six basic categories—gratitude,inspiration, joy, motivation, peace, and relaxation—but use your creativity toexpand these on your own. Once you get this down, you can create playlists forvirtually anything: a day at the beach, songs for rainy days, or a greatplaylist for exercise.In addition, a sample playlist can be found in the back of the book for thecategories mentioned based on my personal experience. See what resonates withyou. And remember, when something resonates with you, it amplifies a vibrationthat already exists in you. This is all part of a more subtle listeningexperience.What I love about the process of listening to other people's playlists is that Iget turned on to some great music I've never heard before! I love the musicaladventure. I also get to understand the other person on a deeper level throughthe music they've selected.The genres that you use for the songs in the playlists listed are really up toyou. For example, in my gratitude playlist I have a Karen Drucker song called“Thank You for This Day.” It is very earthy with a world influence and ismid-tempo. In the same playlist I have “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin)”by Sly and the Family Stone. It is very funky R&B and it is up-tempo. Remember .. . you are orchestrating your experience, so feel free to mix it up as much asyou like!"},{"pageContent":"BRIDGING EMOTIONAL STATES WITH PLAYLISTSEach time you listen to a piece of music, you unleash the potential to take apowerful journey. Just as embarking on a trip to an unknown place can evoke anarray of emotions—excitement, fun, peacefulness—one song, when used withintention and awareness, can be just as powerful. The main difference is a songcan do it in five minutes or less and, on average, costs only about a dollar.Just as a bridge takes you from one side to another, music can become the bridgethat takes you from one emotional state to another. When we group songs that allhave a similar intention or are geared toward evoking a positive emotion, it canamplify the experience. This is where playlists shift from just being a conceptin iTunes to becoming a powerful vehicle to programing your life!IDENTIFY CONTRACTED AND EXPANSIVE ENERGETIC STATESBefore you create a playlist, it is important to identify what energetic stateyou are presently in, what energetic state you want to go to, and what musicplaylist you can use as the bridge to take you there.Many times, we are so caught up in our life situations that we are unaware ofour present energetic condition. Whenever I feel a bit out of balance or likesomething is not quite right, I always check in and ask myself, “Do I feel likeI am in a contracted energetic state or an expansive energetic state?”A contracted energetic state is one in which: * Our energy feels pulled in, as if it were a cold winter day and we are shivering. * Our muscles feel tight. * We are stressed. * We question our gifts and our soul's purpose. * We feel disconnected. * Something or someone has triggered us emotionally. * We feel small, with limited possibilities. * We are in a place where ego is in charge. * We are not listening to our intuition. * We are playing the victim.An expansive energetic state is one in which: * Our energy feels far-reaching and widespread, like being under a beautiful night sky with our arms held open. * We feel relaxed and at peace or inspired and motivated. * We trust in our reason for being here. * We feel connected to something beyond ourselves. * We feel large, with unlimited possibilities. * Ego is not present; the Divine is. * We honor our guidance and intuition.Understanding contracted and expansive energetic states is important becauseidentifying the states we are currently in will shed light on what playlists weneed to use to take us to a different emotional state. If we can identify thatwe are feeling contracted, our next step will be to pick a more expansiveemotional state to move into.DEFINE YOUR PRESENT EMOTIONAL STATEUsing the Heart Song Breathing Process, take a breath, bringing it up throughthe bottom of your feet to your heart and releasing the breath through the heartwith a sigh.Now, take a second breath through the top of your head to your heart, andrelease it through your heart with a sigh.Finally, take a third breath in through the heart and again out through theheart with a final sigh.As you breathe through your heart, does your energy feel like it fits thedescriptions given above of being expansive or contracted? If it feltcontracted, are you able to pinpoint an emotion that might be contributing tothis feeling? For example:Right now I am in a contracted state of being.I am feeling sad.If your energy felt expansive, are you able to pinpoint the emotion thatcontributes to this feeling? For example:Right now I am in an expansive state of being.I am feeling joyous.Write down your answers. Look at the words you filled in. Let them bring you anawareness of your present state. This is part of meeting yourself where you areat and defining your emotional state in this moment. In order for us to knowwhere we want to go, we have to know where we are. This helps us in dealing withnegative emotions instead of pushing them down into our physical body. It alsohelps us in recognizing the positive emotion behind our expansive states so thatwe can amplify them even more.RECOGNIZE YOUR TARGET EMOTIONAL STATENow that you are aware of your present emotional state, let's talk about what'son the other side of the bridge—your target or future emotional state.Again, use the Heart Song Breathing Process to create a blank palette to workfrom. Do several repetitions of the three-breath process.Now, look at your starting phrase and identify the emotion you would like toshift to. For example:Present state: Right now I am in a contracted state of being. I am feeling sad.Future state: The emotion I would like to shift to is being happy.Or if you were in an expansive state:Present state: Right now I am in an expansive state of being. I am feelingjoyous.Future state: The emotion I would like to shift to is ecstasy.Write your future states down on the opposite side of your paper. Now look atyour entries from both sides (present and future). What playlist can you createright now that will take you from one side to the other? Maybe creating agratitude playlist will shift your sadness to a happier state. Maybe creating aninspirational playlist will amplify your joyous state to an ecstatic one. Thechoice is yours!"},{"pageContent":"PLAYLIST CONSTRUCTION AND VIBRATIONAL METAMORPHOSISWith where you are and where you want to go both defined, the next step is tocreate the bridge you'll use to move from one state to the next.Find a quiet place where you won't be interrupted, and give yourself a chance tocreate your first playlist. Make it a listening experience not just for theears, but also for the heart and mind. I suggest starting off with music youalready have and then investigating new music and uncovering new soundterritories. Creating your first playlist can be a life-changing experience. Putyour full energy into it. Don't just pick songs—let them pick you. Make it a funand sacred process. No one will have the exact same playlists as you because noone is exactly the same vibration as you. Your vibration is based on yourcumulative experiences.Incorporate the playlist protocols of volume, tempo, key, genre, rhythm, melody,frequency, and lyrics. Think about the previous discussions of these protocols,and zero in on the ones you feel most drawn to for this particular playlist.Maybe this list will be an experiment in tempo, to move you from a slowed,contracted state to upbeat happiness. Or perhaps the lyrics of certain songsresonate with you today. Mix and match your playlist and explore all theplaylist protocols as you feel drawn to do so. Your playlist can be as many oras few songs as you like; usually my playlists have anywhere from three to tensongs.When you have selected the songs that you want for your first playlist, arrangethem in an order that will take you on a powerful journey. Remember theprotocols you decided to work with, and put the songs in place to create a pathto move you from one state to another. If you decided to work with tempo, maybeyou will arrange the slower songs first to gradually build up to the fastersongs toward the end of the list, in order to leave you with a peppy, hypedsensation by the end.You are the orchestrator of your playlists, and there are no wrong answers, soselect and arrange the songs as you feel will best serve your intentions. If youare unsure of where to start, use a sample playlist in the back of the book asan example."},{"pageContent":"PUTTING YOUR PLAYLIST INTO ACTIONOnce you have the playlist you would like to use to create an emotional shift,you'll next need to allow yourself to have the experience. Find an environmentthat is conducive to listening to the playlist. If your music is geared towardrelaxation or inner peace, find a quiet place, light a candle, and make it asacred experience. If your music is going to ignite, inspire, or createmovement, find a space that will allow you to dance or move. Rearrange thefurniture, crank the music, and have fun! You might feel your energy shift inone song or you might want to listen to the whole playlist—remember, you are theDJ of your life. Own it!SHIFTING YOUR EMOTIONS AND CONSCIOUSNESSYour playlist is the catalyst to shift your being. Sometimes the shift issubtler, other times it is obvious. If you are able to shift your energy even alittle bit that is an amazing start. All of us move through different moods andemotions on a daily basis. It is how long we stay in these moods and emotionsthat determine a pattern. As emotions move into patterns we can fall intoenergetic ruts. These ruts create the foundation for building limited beliefsystems that can move us into challenging times or even life crises. And, as wediscussed, these ruts can even begin to affect our physical body.For example, if as a child I do not feel like my parents trust me, I can beginto have doubts and limited belief systems about moving forward into new areas.In other words, I form challenges in trusting myself. As I get older, when Ifeel like others do not trust me in my life, it triggers the same energy. Thisenergy can be internalized and can lead to depression and higher levels ofstress, both of which may eventually cause chronic health issues.The amazing thing about using your music playlists on a daily basis is that itcan shift those contracted states before they move into patterns. In addition tochanging our emotional state, elevating our emotions creates a positive sharedfield, as we discussed in chapter 2 [part0011_split_001.html#c02], meaning thatas we shift our emotions through our musical playlists, we are sharing thischange with everyone in our lives from our heart outward! In other words, whenwe use music to shift our emotions individually and it enables us to share ourgifts, it not only affects our own life, it also affects the lives of everyonearound us.By identifying where you are emotionally and where you want to move next, youcan create the exact playlist that can take you there.

What I like is sounds.—Dizzy GillespieIN THE LAST FEW CHAPTERS we covered a great deal of information on how to usemusic as a tool for healing and personal transformation. In the next threechapters we will explore how to use aspects of sound and vibration to createmore balance and harmony in a variety of transformative and healing ways. Justas we used our inner music in the beginning chapters and songs in the lastchapter to create personal transformation and improved health, specific soundand vibrational tools can also achieve the same results.I am passionate about exploring how sound can be used to create transformationin our energetic centers. The energy centers are part of a system thatinterprets the emotional aspects of our relationships and situations on a dailyand momentary basis and communicates this to our four bodies. These centers havealso been described as wheels of energy, or chakras, a concept that goes backthousands of years. I think of them as energetic plexes, or fields ofinformation where different aspects of consciousness are held outside ourphysical body. These subtle energetic plexuses interact with the flow of energyin our physical body.SEVEN ENERGETIC CENTERSImage [../images/00007.jpeg]Just as our heart emits an energetic field, so do the different energy centers.Similar to our digestive system that manages how food is digested and how we arenourished, the energetic centers manage the energy of situations, events,relationships, and how daily challenges are emotionally digested and creategrowth that may nourish our souls.Envision a beautiful handmade guitar made from the finest wood and withbreathtaking craftsmanship. Imagine yourself listening to this magnificentguitar. If one of the strings is even slightly out of tune, the instrument isnot playing at optimal levels. That one string affects the overall sound orvibration of the whole instrument. Our body is very similar. Our energy centersare like the strings of the guitar. Each center vibrates at a differentfrequency, and when each is attuned, it aligns with the others perfectly tocreate the flow of energy that assists our bodies in performing optimally. Ifone center is out of tune or alignment, like the guitar, the whole instrumentdoes not perform optimally and energy blockages may occur. These blockages cancreate disharmony, and over a period of time they can manifest as disease in anyor all of our four bodies. Just like a guitar, there are ways we can attune ourenergetic centers utilizing sound and vibrational tools.When I first started learning about the energy centers many years ago, whatexcited me was the potential of being able to tune our instrument (our fourbodies) through tuning our energy centers. I remember buying my first set oftuning forks and learning how to tune the energy centers. I was amazed that Icould feel energy flow in different parts of my body as I tuned the differentcenters. Years later after doing many, many attunements and seeing theirbeneficial effects, I am indeed convinced that we can tune ourselves to createoptimal energetic flow.Specific sounds, tones, and even words assist in re-tuning our energies andstored emotions that no longer serve us. This creates space for their higherpurpose: to balance and align to create optimal energetic flow. The optimalenergetic flow of these centers can bring our four bodies into harmony to createimproved health and quality of life.I look at the energetic centers in a very practical way. Ultimately, we haveonly so much energy that we can spend. We are all here to share a gift. Whateverit is, if our centers move out of balance from constant drama and upset, wedon't have any energy left to spend on our purpose: to share our gifts. Workingwith and understanding how the energy centers function helps us manage ourenergy more effectively.Image [../images/00008.jpeg]We have seven basic energetic centers: the base (root), sacral, solar plexus,heart, throat, third eye, and crown. When a center is not balanced, it tends tobe blocked or misaligned. When it is balanced, it is open and aligned. As Idescribe each center, see which descriptions feel like they pertain to certainsituations in your life. This will show you which centers may be open orblocked. The energetic centers also have specific attributes that are listed,including a related gland that is its physical counterpart, a color, and amusical note that it resonates with. As the energetic centers go up through ourphysical body, the musical notes of each center also ascend."},{"pageContent":"HOW ENERGY CENTERS CAN BECOME BLOCKEDAfter having an argument with a friend, I decided to try to patch things up bycalling him to see if we could work through the situation. He said he was happyI'd called and began to voice his feelings. Seeing the potential for thesituation to be healed, I wanted to be truly present, so I took on the role ofthe listener. For nearly an hour he detailed my role, my fault in the situation,and my responsibility for making him feel a certain way. He put the blame on mefor the pain the situation had caused, and I remained respectfully silent to lethim voice his feelings.After he finished, he stated how much better he felt. Then, before I had achance to express my side of the situation, he said, “Oh my God, I did notrealize it was midnight! I have a big meeting in the morning—can we finish thistomorrow night?” I did not want to escalate the situation when it seemed to bereaching a resolution so I agreed. When I hung up the phone, my throat feltscratchy and I felt like I had a lump in my throat. I realized that not voicingmy emotions had caused a blockage in my throat center.The highest intention of the throat center is to be heard, acknowledged, andappreciated for your words. Although I held the space for the other person toaccomplish that, I allowed him to do so at the expense of not speaking my truth.The result was I could feel the emotion literally and physically stuck in mythroat.This happens to us every day. Centers become blocked or fall out of alignmentdue to stress, trauma, drama, and a host of other situations that can leave usfeeling stuck and out of sorts. Thankfully, the energy centers respond to music,sound, and vibration just as readily as our hearts and brains do, so in music weare provided with an easy solution to release the energies that block ourcenters every day."},{"pageContent":"MY SOUND SOLUTIONAlthough I knew that I would be speaking to my friend the next day, I could notwait to release the energy and emotion that was connected to the situation. Itwas already manifesting in my physical body. I could feel the phone conversationhad really triggered something in me. It felt like getting an electrical shockfrom touching a battery that is holding a charge. The energy is contained insidethe battery and is not released until it is touched by an external source. Theargument was the external source.I attempted to release the energy by journaling about the situation. I hopedthat by exploring the emotions of the situation I would also find the chargebehind it. I asked myself this powerful question: If this person were here rightnow and listening compassionately to every word I was saying, what would I wantto communicate to him? I began to write nonstop. I could feel my feelings andemotions begin to move as I looked at the words on the page, but there wassomething missing. My heart was intuitively telling me that I needed to hear thesound of the written words vibrating through my throat center. So I stood infront of the mirror with my journal and began to read the words aloud. I couldfeel the emotions beginning to move out of my throat as the sound of the wordsvibrated. I could hear the dissonance in the cracks of my voice disappearing.The next thing that happened really surprised me. I began to cry.In my mind I saw a picture of me sharing my truth with my father when I wasabout eight years old. My father had fallen asleep at a play and missed animportant announcement, but he later denied sleeping and argued with me over theinformation he had not heard. Looking back as an adult, the situation does notfeel as devastating as it did then, but as a child it really hurt me that my daddid not trust my word. I now remember distinctly how I was not heard in thesituation and how it felt when he did not believe me. I had been holding thisenergy for many years, and it had been triggered by not feeling heard during myphone conversation with my friend.Identifying the source of our triggered emotions is essential, because wheneverwe bring awareness to these situations we can consciously transform theselimiting belief systems into something healing. Because I became aware of theroot cause of this blockage, the emotional charge had lessened in each situationwhere I was challenged to speak my truth.As I heard, acknowledged, and appreciated my own voice (the highest intention ofthe throat center), it realigned into a more balanced state. I felt as if themessage had been delivered to my friend even without speaking to him. The nextday, there was very little charge left when I had the opportunity to speak withhim about my feelings. What started out as dissonance was transmuted intoharmony and our argument became the vehicle for a stronger friendship.In my work assisting individuals in clearing their centers, I see even morepronounced blockages that cause physical symptoms of discomfort and illness. Inone session, I had a client who was experiencing severe hives. As the sessionunfolded, she began to tell me about the stress her job was creating. Withinthat conversation she described the situation at work as “toxic.” She alsoinformed me she had been “putting up with it” and was looking for a new job. Iasked her if it would be accurate to describe her situation as something she was“stomaching” or “having a hard time digesting.” This question opened thefloodgates and she began to cry. In addition to the hives, she had beenexperiencing stomach issues, indigestion, and severe diarrhea. The emotionaltoxicity she was experiencing at work was having an effect on her physical bodyand was surfacing through her skin and within her stomach. We created anenergetic game plan for coping while she looked for a new job. The next time Isaw her, she informed me she had found a new job and her hives had disappeared.Transformation can occur in an instant when we find a core issue that isblocking an energetic center and release it. Sometimes we have to unveil thesubconscious emotions that are being held. Each center plays a role in our livesand has specific emotional energy that relates to it.In every challenge we encounter, we have an opportunity to embrace the gift ofeach center and move the emotion so it does not become blocked. When thisoccurs, we bring harmony to the energetic center. When the emotion is withheldand not expressed, that specific center can become energetically blocked.Eventually, this lack of energetic flow can affect our physical body and moveinto a place of dissonance. Your body is indeed your personal instrument, andemotions can be the catalyst that can keep your health in tune or can become thebadly sung note that creates stress and disharmony in the body."},{"pageContent":"THE THREE-STEP PROCESS FOR OPTIMAL ENERGY FLOWOnce we find the emotional charge of a situation, or the root cause of theblockage, we can identify the energetic centers that are blocked using the soundof the breath and toning. We can work with releasing the energy held in thosecenters through sounding trigger words or phrases that hold the charge of thesituation. The last part of the session is attuning the energy centers withtuning forks and clearing the energetic field. If you don't have tuning forks,there are other ways to tune the centers that are discussed at the end of thischapter. In addition, during my private sessions, I play designer music that Ihave created that takes my clients to a deep state of relaxation which helps tore-entrain them with their heart and gives their physical, mental, emotional,and spiritual bodies a chance to rejuvenate and integrate their session. I havefound that this three-step process of Identifying, Releasing, and Attuning is anamazing way to create optimal energetic flow in our centers.IDENTIFY ENERGETIC BLOCKSThe first step in working with the energetic centers is to find out if thecenters are in optimal flow. Of course, we can have a person who does energy orhealing work balance our centers; but if we don't know what took them out ofbalance in the first place, the same situations may block them again. Luckily,there are a couple quick and easy ways to use sound to determine if one or moreof your centers is currently blocked.USING THE BREATHStart off by placing your hand on the corresponding location of the energeticcenter you wish to investigate. (Refer to the chart on pages 74–75 if you need arefresher.)Physically touching the center creates a focus for where to send the breath.Bring a deep breath in through the center and release a big sigh out through thecenter. Do this several times. Bringing the sound of your life-force (yourbreath coming in and sigh going out) through each center can begin to open andmove energy. Very often, when energy begins to move we can determine if it feelsopen and expansive or closed and contracted, as discussed in the last chapter.As you breathe through the area, notice if the energy is moving through it, orif it feels stuck. Does the area feel contracted or expansive? Does the energyfeel heavy or light? Don't judge yourself; simply begin to identify what centersfeel expansive and which feel contracted.Go through all seven centers and take notes on how each one feels. Reflect onyour notes after you finish to see where you feel the most contracted and themost expansive.USING TONINGThe breath is a transformational tool to bring a gentle awareness to whichenergetic centers are open and expansive and which are contracted or closed. Thenext step is combining the breath with toning through the different centers.Although there are many variations, the following are the tones I have beenutilizing with benefit:Image [../images/00009.jpeg]Using the base center as an example, gently place your hand on this center.Bring the biggest breath you can into the base of your spine and release thelowest, deepest and longest pitch of U through the center as you release thebreath. Try this several times, utilizing your breath to push the sound out. Theidea is to find the exact sound that feels like it makes that area vibrate.Notice if you are able to feel the sound move through the center effortlessly orif it feels stuck. Does it feel closed and contracted or open and expansive?As you did with the breath exercise on page 65, go through each center, placingyour hands on each one as you practice your tones. As you move through thedifferent tones for each center, the note should get higher. It does not have tobe pretty. (My dog Woody often leaves the room when I am toning through thecenters.)After you go through all of the centers take some notes on which ones you hadchallenges with. What centers felt contracted or blocked in both exercises?These are the centers you will focus on.When I had major dental procedures done and prescription drugs were onlymarginally helping the pain, I decided to incorporate some sound tools to assistin diminishing the pain and anxiety associated with the dental work. Toning intotight areas in our body can loosen the stressors we are holding and bring themto the surface to be released.In the case of my dental work, I began to tone different sounds into the area inmy mouth that was experiencing pain, searching for the resonant tone that wouldrelease it. Through trial and error I found the tone and then the paindiminished considerably. This process can also be utilized for other areas andcenters of the body.The mouth is under the domain of the energetic center of the throat, which isabout speaking one's truth and knowing that the words are heard, acknowledged,and appreciated. As we actively engage our mouth and throat area through vocallytoning, we are taking a powerful role in our own healing process. We are able toutilize our voice as a carrier of our emotions to break up stagnant energy inour physical body. Our voice is being heard, acknowledged, and appreciated byourselves, which sets the space for others to do the same.RELEASE NEGATIVE ENERGYIn order to bring new, higher vibrational energy or elevated emotions into thecenters, and attune them to their highest potential, it is important to releasenegative emotions that we are holding on to. This could be energy that you areholding consciously from a situation that happened yesterday or an event thatyou are holding in your subconscious from years ago. It's like cleaning out yourcloset. If you want to buy a new wardrobe, you have to make room for it. If youare still holding on to that cheerleading uniform from high school or a bowlingball in the back of your closet, they are taking up space. Just like thoseitems, it's time to clear out old energy.I like to use trigger words and phrases for each of the centers that assist inreleasing negative stored emotional energy. If you are holding negative energyor emotions in the centers, you will feel a resonance, a charge, or amagnification of the energy being held in the area when you read the triggerwords. Trigger words and phrases represent the possible energy being held ineach center and help to bring awareness of what it might be related to.Image [../images/00010.jpeg]As you read the trigger words for each center, which ones relate to situationsthat are going on in your life? Do they coincide with the centers that feltblocked during the breathing and toning exercises?Close your eyes for a moment and take some slow breaths from the bottom of yourfeet all the way up to your head and then let the breath move back to your feetbefore you release it. This creates more energetic flow and helps to release anystagnant energy you are holding. Do this several times until you begin to feellighter.Now that you have the energy moving, you will release the energies fromspecific, contracted centers. In each center, release the energy of the triggerwords by breathing into the center and then releasing a sound. Each sound shouldbe connected to the emotion being held. If you feel angry, let the soundsymbolize that anger, such as a shout or a yell; if you feel sad, cry.Once you have gone through the center sounding the emotion, it's time to do thefinal sweep. Review the trigger words for the center you are working with, butthis time add “I release” in front of them (refer to the chart on page 83). Forexample, in the base center, say: “I release addiction, not having enough, ornot feeling nurtured or supported.” Take a big breath in and make a sound torelease the emotion held in the energy center. Continue to do this with eachenergetic center. When you are done, gently breathe through each center one moretime, allowing yourself to feel lighter, more open, and expansive.ATTUNENow that you have identified what centers were blocked and have released some ofthe negative emotions that were being held there, let's attune the centers totheir optimal vibration. The energetic centers can be tuned in many ways,including crystal bowls, toning and chanting, crystals, stones, color, light,essential oils, healing touch, tuning forks, and with intention, songs, andwords. While we don't have the space to cover all these healing modalities here,we will cover using tuning forks, intention, and songs.TUNING FORKSWorking with tuning forks is based on the principle that each of the energeticcenters resonates with a unique vibration or frequency.I think of the energetic centers as a spiritual antenna. When the antenna iscompletely straight, we get the best reception and we can truly “tune in.” Whena center is out of alignment, it's as if the antenna is bent and our receptionis not optimal. Tuning forks can assist us in bringing the centers back intoalignment. As we strike each fork, the vibrational frequency of the fork issounded. We then place the tuning fork over the optimal position of each center.The tone or note of the tuning fork resonates with the same frequency of theenergetic center (see the musical notes listed in the energetic centerdescriptions on pages 74–75) and, almost like a magnet, the fork moves thecenter back into alignment to create optimal flow. This is done with each of theseven centers until they are all in alignment.Of course, if we don't work on the issues that create the blocks, the centerswill move back out of alignment. That is why we work on identifying the blocksand releasing them before we attune them.TUNING THROUGH INTENTIONBy understanding the highest intention of each center we can gauge whatsituations, challenges, people, places, and things pull us away from thatintention and how we can avoid giving our energy away. Each intention starts offwith the words I Am. This is one of the names of God in Hebrew. When we bringthese words into the intention of each of the centers, we bring in the power ofconnecting our hearts with the heart of the creator. Our intention is connectedto the highest potential to create in this way. As you connect with each center,bring a focus to that area again by placing your hand on each center. Giveyourself a breath in and speak the following intentions out loud after releasingyour breath. Continue to breathe in and out of the energetic center, allowingthe energy to integrate and balance, then move to the next center.Image [../images/00011.jpeg]TUNING THROUGH SONGUtilizing songs that carry the optimal intention for each energy center isanother fun way to balance and harmonize each center. You can listen to thesongs anywhere and also make a transformative shift in a short amount of time.Below are some musical suggestions for each center and a rationale for why Ipicked each song. As you listen, I suggest placing your hand on each of thecenter's locations and gently breathing in and out of them as you listen.Image [../images/00012.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"THE BENEFITS OF OPTIMAL FLOW IN OUR ENERGY CENTERSI invite you to try the different ways to create balance in the energeticcenters that we've covered. There are many paths on the road to optimalenergetic flow. The more we work with our energetic centers, the moreeffectively we are able to manage our life situations and challenges on a dailybasis. Here are a few of the benefits of this practice: * We become more grounded and focused. * Our relationships are more harmonious. * We experience more joy. * We experience less stress and anxiety. * We give and receive in a more balanced way. * We communicate better. * We follow our intuition. * We spend less energy reacting or overreacting in situations and move to a state of responsibility where we choose our response (our ability to respond).A well-known law of nature, the ripple effect, comes into play when we begin towork with our energetic centers. The ripple effect says that when you drop astone in a calm, serene pond, it ripples outward from its center.

Over the course of that nextyear, I saw his physical body diminish. Although his body was transitioning,there was healing that was occurring in our family structure, and I believe mydad was holding on to accommodate that.The day before he passed, I found myself alone in my father's hospital room.This was the first time I had been alone with him in over a year. It was alsothe first time my mother had been away from him, and although she regretted notbeing there, I know my being alone with him was for a purpose. As I stood by hisbedside, he was mostly unconscious. His eyes were rolling in his head but he wasstill fighting to stay. I'm not sure if he was aware that I was in the room.Then something very strange happened. I heard an inner voice guiding me to singto him. I tried to ignore it, but I heard it again. In my head I answered, Whatdo you want me to sing? I heard back, Just sing.I felt ridiculous; I didn't know what to sing. So, I closed my eyes and wentinto my heart. In a moment I found myself very close to him at his headboardwith my hand on top of his head. I felt myself toning into the top of his headand I began to feel warmth emanate. As I continued to sing different tones Icould feel his energy releasing weight and getting lighter from the top of hishead. Expanding. When I opened my eyes my dad was looking directly at me. He wasconscious and aware. I was amazed. I asked if he could hear me, and although hecould not really speak he nodded his head. In that moment, I was able to trulytell my dad what he meant to me. He acknowledged me and nodded as I spoke. Itold him not to be afraid and I thanked him for all he had given me. It was themost amazing conversation we had ever had, so much of it without words.That night my dad left his physical body. After holding on for a long time hewas finally able to let go. I believe that chanting and toning assisted inopening his top energetic center so his soul could leave his physical body withgrace and ease. The crown center is a bridge between the physical and etherealbodies. A primary function of chanting is to amplify our spiritual connectionand deepen our relationship with God. This was the beginning of my journey intruly understanding the power of chanting."},{"pageContent":"CHANTINGThe word chant comes from the French word chanter, which means to sing. Chantsmay range from a simple melody involving a few notes to more complex melodiesusing many notes.In essence, the common chord that weaves through chanting in many cultures andreligions is that chant is a way to expand our spiritual connection. It enablesus to convey our emotions in another form than traditional speech. It is a wayfor us to have an experience beyond our intellectual thought process. In fact,chanting is the perfect practice to move out of negative, repetitive thoughtpatterns and mind chatter. It can be done individually or in a group setting andis considered a strong pathway to spiritual development.Chanting is also an excellent tool to incorporate into your daily musicalprogram to calm the busy mind. Most of us have experienced repetitive internaldialogue at different times in our lives. Replaying a future event over and overin our minds in an effort to uncover the many possible outcomes, or reliving asituation that has already occurred, can cause a great deal of stress. Listeningto and participating in music that features repetitive chanting occupies andfocuses our attention on musical and tonal phrases and can take us out ofdestructive, repetitive internal dialogue. As our focus shifts, the story andstress can be freed and we can move back into a more harmonious state. Chantingtakes us out of our normal time continuum and allows us to tame our ego. As thisoccurs, we move to a deeper state of relaxation.SEED SYLLABLESA powerful way to become acquainted with the power of chanting is through thechanting of om. The sound and syllable of the word om, or aum, is said tocontain every sound in the universe and weaves through many languages. That iswhy it is called a seed syllable. When we chant the word om, we expand ourenergetic field and open our connection to the Divine. Although it sounds like aone-syllable word, om is broken down into four syllables, each with a differentmeaning.AAHThe aah sound represents the creation aspects of the universe.Within the sound of aah we connect with ourselves on a physical level. The soundresonates in the lower abdomen and throat.OOOHThe U sound (pronounced oooh) expands our focus and connects us to a higherpower, which helps us open up to clarity and expand our essence of light.MMMMThis sound unites us to the essence of oneness. It vibrates at the crown of ourhead and bridges our physical and ethereal bodies and opens us up to a deeperspiritual connection. As we open up to this connection, we allow ourselves topause and feel all that is.(SILENCE)The fourth sound is silence. This is where we integrate the experience beyondwords and feel it in our physical and energetic bodies. It's the space betweenthe sounds. Breathe that in. Allow yourself to hear and experience the silence.I invite you to experiment with each of the syllables; chant them separately andtogether, allow them to move through your body, mind, and spirit. Practice infive-minute intervals. Then work your way up to chanting om for twenty minutesduring your week as part of your musical practice. You will be amazed by thetransformational results!Utilizing om is a great starting point on the journey to using chanting as ahealing tool, and it is always powerful. Because it contains every sound in theuniverse, we never outgrow it, no matter where we are on our path. Many culturesand spiritual practices also chant additional mantras, which can be just ashelpful and can assist many different areas of our health."},{"pageContent":"MANTRASA mantra is words or sounds repeated to aid concentration in meditation. Theorigins of the mantra date back over three thousand years and now are used inmany religious and spiritual practices.

Wecan utilize the same principles but customize them to transform negativeemotions, anxiety, and mental and physical stress.CREATING A DAILY MANTRA EXERCISEThink of something that is going on in your life right now and is bringinganxiety or stress or is draining the positive energy out of your day. Keep thissituation in mind as you create a daily mantra to help you manage thesecircumstances.Think about the energy of the situation and try to represent the negativeaspects or feelings associated with a few words. For example, if you are in asituation where you're unsure of yourself, the negative aspects might be: doubt,fear, and uncertainty. Write down the negative words that represent thesituation.Now that you are looking at these words, you can see how heavy they feel. Theycarry a vibration that might be draining your energy. Think of three words thatwould act as a remedy for you and would bridge your current state to a morepositive state. For example, three words that would be a remedy to doubt, fear,and uncertainty are trust, love, and clarity. Write down these words as well.When you look at the three positive words on your paper you will see they feelmuch lighter.

A great way to resynchronize, move into rhythm, and connectwith others is through a drum circle. When we drum, it is symbolic of theheartbeat that exists in all of us; it represents the common thread that weavesus together. In a drum circle, we have the opportunity to participate andexperience the different frequencies of the drums and their role in creatingcoherence. The low floor drum that connects us to Mother Earth carries a simplebut powerful heartbeat. The high frequency of the small shakers connects us tothe energy of Father Sky and keeps a constant moving pace. The mid frequenciesof the hand drums fill in, syncopate, and vary the rhythm.Feeling our internal drum (our heart) entrain with the drums we are playing is avery beautiful and powerful feeling. Although the drums and players vary, thereis an underlying order that is occurring. This order assists in creating morecoherence in our physical body as well.As we participate in the circle and switch drums, we have the ability tounderstand that each drum has a different role. As one drum changes, it changesthe whole rhythm, just as each one of us changing affects the transformation ofthe whole planet. Understanding the relationship of the drum and the drummerallows us to understand the dance of life.Our roles in the dance of life, just as in the drum circle, are constantlychanging and transforming. Our vibration changes based on situations and eventsthat occur in our lives, and very often we need to resynchronize and find therhythm within a situation. Bringing order where disorder exists createscoherence in our lives as well as our bodies. Just as we have to find the rhythmto drum to a song we are hearing for the first time, new challenges require usto shift and let go of rigidity.

We have all experienced instances when wordshave comforted us. I remember in a time of emotional crisis, a friend told me ina very soothing and heartfelt way, “Everything is going to be okay.” I know itseems simple, but there was so much kindness and authenticity in the sound ofher voice that I was deeply moved in knowing that her words resonated withtruth.Words are not always included in this topic of sound and vibration, and yet theycan be an amazing sound tool to create change. It is said that in some religionsthe whole universe was created by the word of God. We can also create our ownuniverse or world with our words. The internal and external words you use on adaily basis tell a story to your body. Just like music, the words you speak cancreate harmony or dissonance in your four bodies. If you are repeatedly usingnegative phrases or words to describe a situation and they are coupled withnegative emotions such as fear or anger, what is this telling your physicalbody? What are your words composing and orchestrating in your life?I have a friend who was diagnosed with cancer and created an amazing shift bychanging one word . . . chemo. After realizing that this word was creatinganxiety and stress, both of which had the potential of hindering his healingprocess, he began using the word “treatment” instead. The word created a feelingthat was more calming to him and instigated a different conversation with hisbody and his mind, one that could be more conducive to his healing process. Nowimagine how replacing the words “life-threatening” or “chronic” with the term“health challenge” could diminish the energy of the not-so-happy ending you aretelling your physical body.Many times, we are speaking to our body on a subconscious level and don't evenrealize that we have been composing a not-so-pretty song. We have been creatinga state of dissonance and have not realized that we are steering ourselves intodisharmony. But we can get back on the right path by using the power and soundof our words coupled with intention.Our intentions create a vibratory field that is produced from our thoughts,words, and emotions. When the field becomes strong enough, it can attractsimilar vibrations to manifest the intention.Music is an excellent example of how intention can create and effect a vibratoryfield. When I compose music, I create an intention to evoke a certain feeling inthe listener. The combination of notes and putting my specific targeted emotionsinto the music creates a feeling that is felt beyond myself. The people in theroom listening also feel it.Setting an intention consists of doing something (an action) and becoming theemotion of the action. For example, if you want to see love, be love. I callthis combining “to do” and “to be.” Another example is, if I want to set theintention of creating joy in the people listening to my music, I choose a chordthat has specific notes that sound joyful. The action of playing the chord isthe “to do.” When I embed my actual feelings and emotions of joy into the chordas I play, this is the “to be.” By putting the emotion (to be) into the action(to do), I am sparking the intention into motion by providing it with newinformation. When you, the listener, hear the chord being played combined withthe emotion, you move beyond just hearing the emotion—you feel it.Words are no different. When we create intention, we are setting a purpose withour words and emotions. When words and emotions align, we create an attractionpattern that can manifest the intention created, just as in the music examplegiven above. Similar to playing the piano, words move beyond the personcomposing them and affect the listener. Think of the universe as the listenerand the eager audience that awaits the beautiful composition of your intentionand then responds with a vibratory match. Let me share a powerful story of howintention manifested in my life!"},{"pageContent":"THE LES PAUL GUITARI was about fourteen when my parents decided they would fulfill my dream ofhaving an electric guitar. I had been playing and writing songs for about twoyears, and the family concerts (my sister on piano and me on guitar) weregetting more frequent. They gave me a budget of two hundred dollars and I haddecided on a Fender Telecaster. We went to the House of Music in New Rochelleand I tried a bunch of guitars. We had almost decided on one when the salesmanasked if he could show us one more.He realized he had a live one on the hook and came back with a hard case withGIBSON printed on it. I can still see the hot pink lush velvet interior lining(a lá the 1970s) stimulating my young eyes, but not as much as the gleamingGibson Les Paul cherry sunburst guitar. “Oh my God, that's the guitar Jimmy Pageand Carlos Santana play!” I said in excitement. I think it was then that my dadrealized he was in trouble. He knew those were my favorite players. I could seethe emotion in his eyes as he asked to talk to me for a moment. “You know yourmother's going to kill me if I get you this guitar,” he said, which was prettyfunny considering how small my mom was. He continued, “If I buy you this guitar,you have to promise me that you're going to stick with music.”I was fourteen—of course I promised. As soon as I promised, I remember my dadgoing to the car. He came back with a dusty French horn that was in the trunkand put it on the counter to trade in. He laid down a few credit cards next tothe French horn to complete the transaction. I can still feel that heavy casedigging into my little hands as I carried my new Gibson Les Paul back to thecar.Years later, I realized that in that moment I made more than a promise; I made acommitment so strong that it seeded a destiny for music to be in my lifeforever. I created an intention. Over many years, I would look at the name LESPAUL embedded into the guitar, and it became a symbol of my parents' belief inme, imbued with positive and elevated emotion. This repeated event created anenergetic field that moved into harmony and alignment beyond my wildestimagination.No matter how tempted I was to sell that guitar in my early years of financialstruggle, I never could or would. The universe responded, and thirty years laterI ended up working with the inventor of the electric guitar, Les Paul, on atribute album for his ninetieth birthday. The song I coproduced, called “69Freedom Special,” won the Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental in 2005. I stronglybelieve this never would have manifested if it weren't for that guitar. Everytime I looked at it, I was reminded of my dad's faith in me, despite his ownlimited beliefs. This emotional response became a type of soul food thatnourished the intention I had planted in the promise to my dad. I became thefrequency of that Les Paul guitar, and the rest is history!"},{"pageContent":"HOW TO SET YOUR INTENTIONNow it's time for you to tap into the power of your intention.

As youread these words, do they create a calling to your heart that cannot be ignored?This is where the most powerful intentions are seeded.It's important to communicate clearly, especially when setting your intention.If you are using the words “I want,” you are telling the universe you aremissing something. Fine-tune it with higher vibrational words such as “Ichoose.” If you are using the word “try,” it carries a heavy vibration, like youare trying to walk up the mountain or saying there is room for failure. Replace“try” with “creating”: I am creating the moment of walking up the mountain.Every word holds a unique vibration. It should be like music to the ears of theuniverse. Remember, you are the conductor. Take a moment to fine-tune the wordsthat you have written down.The intention you have written down is your action or your to-do. Now, what isthe emotion you would like to hold the to-do in? This is the chalice that holdsyour sacred intention; it could be love, it could be courage, it could bepassion. Go into your heart and feel it. Place your hands on your heart; take abreath into your heart and a breath out through your heart. Tap into your musicwithin, and feel and become the emotion of your intention. When you have it,open your eyes and write it down. This is the to-be of your intention.When you combine your to-do with your to-be, your intention is nurtured,nourished, and sparked into action. In addition, visualize the intention hasalready happened and then let it go. This combination is powerful and canactivate an intention—even if it doesn't manifest immediately."},{"pageContent":"USING SONGS TO OPTIMIZE INTENTIONTo boost your clarity of intention, choose songs that correspond with theemotion you are trying to convey. If you want joy as your to-be in yourintention, then I suggest listening to joyous songs (or your joy playlist) asyou settle in to get clear about your intention.I'm sure you've listened to a piece of music and felt the song was written foryou. The composer's feelings were so authentic that they created a strongemotional resonance that awakened and magnified something within you. I'm alsosure you have experienced a song in which the emotions did not match themessage. The singer's intention might have been to create a certain state, butthe outcome was not received.Just like the energies we put out as we create our intentions, all of thesesubtle energies come through in music as well, so make sure you choose a pieceof music that really moves you to a clear, coherent emotional state before youset your intention to help you fine-tune and optimize it for your benefit.Continue to utilize this piece of music as part of your daily practice toreconnect you with your intention and to nurture it.CONSCIOUS ENTRAINMENTAs we set our intention and create a vibratory field, it is important to take onthe role of the conscious observer. Just as a gardener cares for his or hergarden to make sure weeds don't take over the fertile terrain, you are thegardener of your own energetic field. When you create this field from your clearand pure intention, your vibration is very high; you are optimistic and yourintention is aligned. When you share an intention with someone, you invite hisor her energy into this field. Up until this point, your intention was onlyshared with the universe. Before you invite someone in to share or support yourintention, envision yourself sharing your intention with him or her.The intention you have created is like a beautiful piece of music. Is thisperson you've selected to share it with singing along and harmonizing with you?Do his or her words sound like someone who cannot carry a tune?When someone is bringing harmony to your energetic field, * There is a supportive energy that feels aligned with the words they are speaking. * If there is critique, it is constructive and the points they make strengthen your intention. * You feel inspired, ignited, and energetic after speaking with them. * Your intention and energetic field feels stronger. * You feel like they are part of your ultimate support team.When someone is bringing dissonance to your energetic field, * There is an underlying energy that does not feel supportive, although his or her words may seem to be. * The success of your intention might be questioned and undermined without constructive criticism. * You feel energetically drained after speaking with the person. * The intention you shared does not feel as strong to you; you are less excited about it or are questioning it after your conversation. * You don't feel like you want to share your intention with this person again.You are the orchestrator of your field, and you get to decide who is harmonizingand who is creating discordant notes. You do not need to let those who createdissonance into your field. Keep your intention clean and your boundaries firmto support yourself in staying true to what you want to create in your life.When you are not aware, you can unconsciously entrain with lower vibrational ornegative emotions others carry and allow them to punch energetic holes in yourfield and your intention. Before you know it, your intention has diminished andyou're not sure why. If you are not able to bring harmony to the situation, thenpull the weed from the garden or withdraw from depending on this person'ssupport. You require the ultimate spiritual team for support, and you are worthit!As we become more aware of how we spend our energy, we can begin to fine-tuneourselves and our relationships so dissonance is limited. We begin to knowourselves on a deeper level and find harmony with ourselves and others.Utilizing music, sound, and vibration and applying the tools, techniques, andprocesses is an important step to this awareness. Keep your instrument attunedon a daily basis and ignite the powerful emotions within you to maintain thepath of living a musical life."},{"pageContent":"SOUND TOOLS FOR TRANSFORMATIONHere are some powerful suggestions for implementing some of this chapter'sconcepts to create transformation in your life right now. * If the universe was listening to every thought and word you were saying (and it is), what intention would you create? * Find a song that will complement or enhance your intention.

His wife saidthat whenever he was stuck on a problem that seemed insurmountable, he wouldplay chords on the piano to clear his mind. When he came back to the problemafterward, he often broke through his mental blocks and was able to tackle theproblem from a new, energized state of being. Music helped him to move out ofhis logical mind into pure creativity, where the greatest breakthroughs becamepossible.Creativity allows us to stretch into unchartered territories and expand ourconsciousness. As we move into the creative process, we tap into our imaginationand our intuition. In addition, we are utilizing both our mind's intelligenceand our heart's intelligence, yet we are also connecting to the intelligenceoutside ourselves. When we connect with this universal source that has createdeverything, we draw from infinite creative possibilities beyond our limitedexperiences."},{"pageContent":"CREATING DIVINE COLLABORATIONSNature is the music of the universe and orchestrates beauty in every moment.Before you start your creative process, I invite you to take a walk in nature.Listening to the sounds of nature is a miraculous experience that allows us todeepen our spiritual connection and experience a feeling that there is somethingbeyond us that has a wild and vivid imagination and an amazing sense ofcreation. You can call it the Universe, the Divine, Creator, or God—but what istruly important is that by connecting with nature and the amazing array ofsounds it provides, we bring in the potential to tap into its infinitepossibilities, boundless imagination, and limitless outcomes and channel thatsource into our own creations.I begin my creative process by inviting that source to create with me. I used todream of collaborating with Bono from U2. No offense to Bono, but God blows himout of the water! These divine collaborations have changed my creative process.God is in a constant state of creation, and we can be as well. When we allowourselves to become the vessel that God flows through, we are no longer incharge and are able to release ourselves to the creativity that pours out of us.In 2002, I received a song by special delivery: in a dream. At the time, I hadbeen reading Neale Donald Walsch's book Conversations with God, and I wasaffected deeply. It's hard to describe this dream because the experience wasreally beyond words. I have heard many say “We are all one,” but up until thisdream I had never truly experienced it.In the dream, I was shown how we are all connected from the perspective of ablade of grass. Everything that passed me was seen and felt as a miracle inevery cell of my body. The scent within the breeze, the blue within the sky, themist within the rain, everything! Even though I was the blade of grass, I wasalso the breeze, the scent within the breeze, the mist within the rain, the bluewithin the sky, and they were me. I was everything and everything was me.Everything had a direct effect on everything else. There was no separation. Iwas given the gift of seeing things “through the eyes of God.” In the dream Iheard the words to the chorus as clear as day. The melody came with it and wasquite haunting. It felt like I had sung it thousands of times. I woke up andwrote the words down on a pad:And through the Eyes of God,I have learned to seethat I am everything andeverything is me.And through the Breath of God,I have learned to breathe.And I am everything and everything is me.I remember wrestling with sharing this song with the world. The word Goddefinitely was triggering me and brought back everything I had questioned aboutorganized religion. I could still hear my persistent inner voice arguing, “It'sa nice song, but it's not going on my record.” I then heard an inner voicerespond, “No, it is your record!” After sitting with it for a while, I thought,it is quite difficult to put a word to the connection that we experience beyondourselves. The connection to something more than us . . . what we call it is notas important as the connection that we experience. This is what joins us andcannot separate us. I thought, If that is the case, then I am good with callingthat God.Albert Einstein puts it eloquently: “That deep emotional conviction of thepresence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in theincomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.” This song was a messenger tomy soul so that it may truly know that there is no separation. I was guided topass this message on to anyone who would listen, so now I am passing it on toyou in the hope that it will inspire your creative process.Up until that dream, I thought that I wrote my own songs. It is with this songthat I realized one of the main purposes of music is to expand and deepen ourspiritual connection. This dream set the knowing that all songs could be divinecollaborations—all creation could be. We simply have to invite God in and allowthe message to be received by the soul.The following powerful steps will allow music, sound, and vibration to supportand inspire you in creating your own divine collaborations!"},{"pageContent":"FIVE STEPS FOR UTILIZING MUSIC TO ENHANCE YOUR CREATIVE PROCESSSTEP 1: MAKE TIME TO CREATEBefore you even start your creative process, it is important to create time forit. Even if it's just a short period of time, when you deem that time sacred youwill be amazed by the quality and quantity of what can be created.I remember when I was moving into the process of creating an album and was givena shorter deadline than expected. I had to reevaluate my creative process andhow time related to it. Normally, my process involved five-hour recordingsessions, but that would be impossible with the deadline I was given. It wastime to shift my belief system that I needed a large block of time to becreative. What I realized was that it wasn't necessarily about the amount oftime I allotted, but more about enhancing the quality of the time I had. Even ifI only had five minutes to create, I started to look at those five minutes as asacred gift from the universe.Many times we sabotage the actual time we have because we are stressed, not inthe mood, or cannot shift our emotions to the necessary state to create. When wedeem something sacred, we are announcing to the universe that we are aligning toour divine connection and our creative energy opens up and begins to flow.To make any time a sacred time, begin by carving out small periods of time inyour schedule to create. Anywhere from five minutes to half an hour in themorning, after lunch, and/or before sleep is a great start.Now, let's make the experience more sacred with music. Choose a song thatsupports your creative energy. If you don't have a particular song in mind forthis exercise, I'd suggest “Sacred Space” by Llewellyn. I love the way themysterious flutes invite you into the song and the light wind chimes bring inthe sense of a gentle breeze to caress the creative process. The important thingis to play a piece of music that will assist in opening and connecting you toyour heart, something that speaks to you. The creative process is one thatbridges the emotions of the heart and the imagination of the mind.Get comfortable, and listen to your song, placing your hands on your heart. Feelthe energy of your heart and mind connecting. Allow yourself to take thesemoments to establish the connection between your mind and heart and tostrengthen that connection to bring you to your highest creativity. When thesong finishes, breathe in through your heart and out through your heart one lasttime before moving on.You will notice that once you carve these small amounts of time into your dailypractice, you begin to find even more time to create when you least expect it.The ideas begin to flow while you are stuck in traffic, waiting to be seated ata restaurant, doing dishes, or waiting in the doctor's office.STEP 2: SHIFT YOUR ENVIRONMENTDo you have a space that feels conducive to creating? When you look around, doyou feel safe and serene? These feelings set the space to be inspired. Does theroom feel constrictive or expansive to your creative process? Your environmentis a chalice for your creative energy, so it should feel sacred, just like yourcreative process.Music is one of the most powerful ways to instantly shift the energy of aphysical space. Have you ever walked into a spa and noticed how the musicinvites you into the environment? It is almost as if your body and mind takes asigh when you enter and you relax. The environment you create in can have thesame effect. I suggest using the song “Sacred Space” by Douglas Blue Feather tohelp you encourage more sacredness in your space. The beautiful Native Americanflutes, gentle bell chimes, luring melodies, and wide range of grounding andethereal tones work well to clear a space.In addition to using music to clear a space, we can use sound and vibration aswell. Sound does a great job of breaking up stagnant, heavy, or negative energyin a room. If you have a hand drum, the lower frequencies of the drum work wellwith clearing energy in a space. Start by working with the larger areas of theroom first and begin to drum into areas that feel heavy. For smaller areas,shakers and striking high frequency tuning forks can fine-tune the energy of theroom. Use your intuition, and if the room is still feeling stagnant, repeat theprocess until you notice a change that is conducive to your creation.If you don't have a drum or tuning fork I recommend the song “Drum Circle” byWasichu, which incorporates vibrant and passionate drums with a wide frequencyrange. There is a powerful intensity that builds within this piece that helpsdissolve heavy energy.STEP 3: MEDITATE WITH MUSICAs we move into the pure state of creation we begin to refill our bodies withrejuvenating energy. If you are in a state of stress, your vessel is probablyalready full—but not with rejuvenating energy. Rather, it's full of your days'events, deadlines, challenges, and mind chatter. Meditation is a wonderful wayto empty your vessel and transform your deadlines to lifelines, your challengesto triumphs, and your mind chatter to intuition.When choosing music for meditation, I usually use instrumental music or musicwith chants. As your heart entrains with the compositions and you relax, yourbrain shifts. These slower brain wave states are where we find ourselves“drifting” or daydreaming. It is from this very frame of mind that we sparkamazing ideas that seem to come out of nowhere.Allow yourself to meditate for a few minutes to reinforce opening your pathwayto creation. Try this song for starters: “Deep Theta 6 Hz, Part 8” by StevenHalpern.STEP 4: FREE FALL WITH MUSICNow that you feel lighter and have room to fill your vessel with new creativeenergy, it is time for the free fall process. Be prepared to jot down youramazing ideas.To free fall into your process, put on Constance Demby's “Haven of Peace” orchoose your own music to stimulate creativity, and get ready to write. You maywish to ask a question, as this can spark deeper and higher levels ofcreativity. I like to start off by asking, “What do I need to know about thecreation of X (my project)?” This starts the process by asking for information Imight not personally have and taps into the infinite field beyond for theanswers.Then, open up the faucet of ideas and let your thoughts flow! Write them down asthey occur to you. The important thing is to allow a free flow of ideas. As yourwords begin to manifest in written form, don't stop to judge or edit them. Thereis no right or wrong; you are just allowing creation to move through you. Beopen to receiving intuitive guidance.If you feel like you are moving into your mental thought process andconstricting the energy, then you can stop or meditate and restart.When the song has finished, stop. Or, if you still feel like your energy isexpansive and your connection is open when the song ends, continue to write.When you feel your session is complete, use another song to help you ground inthe energy of creative flow. You might try my song, “Hallelujah Amen.” Musicwith low drums or more bass usually assists in grounding because we can actuallyfeel those frequencies in our body, not just hear them.Whether it is for five minutes or five hours, whether you are writing a book,painting, or updating your résumé, every free falling session is productive.Even if your idea has not fully blossomed in the first free fall session, it isseeded. You can bring in the same creative energy to fine-tune and edit yourfree fall session at any time. This process can a be used for painting,sculpting, writing song lyrics, drafting a business plan, planning a party, orplotting a brand new career . . . anything you want to create!STEP 5: MOVE THROUGH CREATIVE BLOCKSThere are times when we may experience a dead end in our creative process butstill have the desire to continue. When this happens, you can use all of thetechniques we have previously discussed to help you move through creativeblocks. To recap, these techniques are: * Heart Song Breathing Process * Chanting * Balancing your energy centersYou can also break through blocks by taking a five-minute dance break. Choose apiece of music from your inspirational playlist or one of the sample playlistslisted in the back of the book. Stand up, move, and groove. Shake your body andhave fun. Moving stagnant energy will reopen your creative flow, and listeningto someone else's musical creation can reignite your creative juices!If you are a musician yourself, you can also play an instrument to help youbreak through creative blocks. I can speak from personal experience that thereis nothing like playing a musical instrument (your voice is also a musicalinstrument) to relieve stress and move through creative blocks. Granted, thereis a learning curve to get started—but once you do, it is well worth your time.Playing an instrument engages all four of your bodies.In addition, playing an instrument can also be a beautiful spiritual experience.Those moments when we go to “the zone” and are deeply connected to somethingbeyond ourselves help us to move through creative blocks. When we allowourselves to improvise and let the music come through us, we are able to tapinto a unified field of sound, vibration, and music.There have been many times I have picked up my guitar when experiencing acreative block and just started playing. Moments later, I experienced new sparksof creative energy and the block was gone! The good news is that you are nevertoo old to pick up a new musical talent. In fact, science shows that one of thebest ways to keep your memory sharp is to learn a new musical instrument.Sometimes the best way to move through a creative block is collaboration.Remember the age-old saying “Two heads are better than one”? It holdstrue—especially when it comes to creativity. Two hearts are also better thanone! When we combine the knowledge of the brain with the wisdom of the heart wecan create anything. The combined idea moves beyond any concept each individualcould have created on his or her own.I have had many experiences when bringing someone in to collaborate on a songbrought it from a good song to a great song. When we combined our harmoniousheart energy, it created something truly unique. This is true synergy. I'm notsure who created the term “heartstorming,” but I think it perfectly describesthe method of tapping into the heart's energy in the creative process.Bringing something into existence can be one of the most amazing adventures wecan have in our lifetime. As we create, we are in a high vibrational state,elevating our emotions and our consciousness to collaborate with the ultimatecreator in the process. Treat each creation as a sacred journey, and allowmusic, sound, and vibration to amplify your creative process."},{"pageContent":"SOUND TOOLS FOR TRANSFORMATIONHere are some powerful suggestions for implementing some of this chapter'sconcepts to create transformation in your life right now. * Set aside a certain amount of time today to create and clear a physical space that is conducive to your creative process. * If you feel like you are experiencing a creative block, try one of the creative block-busters we explored in this chapter, such as collaborating with a friend. * Nurture an idea that has been on the backburner and apply some of the concepts in this chapter to move the idea into physicality."},{"pageContent":"SUGGESTED MUSICThe following songs are described in detail within this chapter and are highlyrecommended for your creative process! * “Through the Eyes of God” by Barry Goldstein * “Sacred Space” by Llewellyn * “Drum Circle” by Wasichu * “Deep Theta 6 Hz, Part 8” by Steven Halpern * “Haven of Peace” by Constance Demby * “Hallelujah Amen” by Barry Goldstein"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/00002.jpeg]"},{"pageContent":"11CREATE YOUR ULTIMATE DAY EVERY DAY WITH MUSICTo me, the concept of distance is not important.

Just like breakfast breaks the fast of not having eaten during your sleepcycle, your morning song breaks the silence of being the first music you hearfor the day. Ask yourself, “What piece of music will feed my soul and set thevibration of my day?” Just like your breakfast, the songs can be different everyday, depending on where you are emotionally. Remember, music is a bridge thattakes you from one state to another, and it can also support and expand yourcurrent positive state.Pick a song or piece of music that reflects or harmonizes with your intentionfor the day. You can use one of the sample songs in the back of the book, orchoose your own. The process for this is simple.

Itis usually playful, whimsical, or serene to distract us from the stressful sideeffects. This is not an accident. We can apply this lesson in a productive wayand make music a positive distraction from stress to regroup, re-center,rejuvenate, and reconnect.A great analogy for using music, sound, and vibration in your midday iscomparing your midday music to lunch.

Just as you take a lunch break to replenish andnourish yourself, your musical selections and sound tools should do the same.Following are some fast, simple, and yet powerful ways to reduce your middaystressors with music.COME HOME TO YOUR HEARTIf you find yourself in a contracted, stressful state, take a few minutes andconnect to your inner music: your heartbeat, your breath, and your sigh. Veryoften we take on the energy of different people or challenging situations thathave occurred during our day.

Once we learn to red flag ourselves, we canstop magnifying stressful situations by implementing music and sound tools inour midday to bring us back to our original morning intentions."},{"pageContent":"WINDING DOWN WITH MUSICWhen we utilize music to regulate our sleeping patterns, it becomes a call orsignal to the core of our spirit that it is time to wind down and move from theexcitement of the day into the sacredness of night. I would suggest utilizing apiece of music at about 60 bpm (one beat every second), the rate of music thatcan entrain your heart to a relaxed state, as you'll remember from earlier. Yourheart and brain can entrain to this relaxed state and bridge you into a moreconducive physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual state to move into restfulsleep. About an hour before you go to sleep every night, utilize a very peacefulpiece of music to cleanse and reset with.Just as Pavlov conditioned his dogs to anticipate food by hearing the sound of abell, we can condition ourselves to anticipate sleep with the sound of music tomake our nights more sacred. As we hear the music, we let out a sigh andsurrender all that is not in our control to a higher power. You may be lookingfor a way to calm the household down. This practice of having music playing canbe a great way of winding down together. Your kids will start to identify thewinding down process with the music. When we can train our four bodies to relaxat an early age, we create better sleep habits and have less stress and anxietyas adults.In addition to listening to music at 60 beats per minute, some criteria that Ihave found to be beneficial: * Listen to music with long tones—When tones or notes are sustained there is less movement musically and less for your mind to interpret. There is an underlying rhythm that creates a flow, but it is not percussive. It is similar to the flow of a tide that gently cascades its way up to the sands of the beach and smoothly rejoins its original source. Music with long tones can create this same gentle ebb and flow. * Select music with limited melodies—Melody engages the mind's judgment system. As we hear a melody we move through a decision-making process. We also perceive the outcome of a melody, and anticipate its next note, making it harder to sleep. * Avoid music that triggers emotions—Different musical pieces can trigger various emotions. When the music remains neutral, it allows the listener to have his or her own experience. The intention of relaxation music before bedtime is that it creates a relaxing environment without distraction.Imagine definitively becoming the DJ of your life and programming your day withmusic, sound, and vibration to assist in getting prepared for corporatemeetings, challenging family situations, or life celebrations. In addition tothese three key times for integrating music, you can work music into your day inmuch smaller intervals, wherever your schedule might allow.Making music part of your daily schedule is truly the start to creating atransformation.

One of thegreatest fears of American adults is the loss of memory. With these startlingstatistics, focus on treating and managing the negative symptoms of Alzheimer'sdisease is crucial. This disease touches not only the person directly diagnosed,but also his or her family and friends, who in most cases watch the person'squality of life deteriorate day by day. Insomnia is one of the most frequentnegative symptoms of Alzheimer's for the patient and caregivers.The use of both music and music therapy shows amazing results in Alzheimer'spatients. The difference between the terms “music” and “music therapy” used hereis that “music” means the music itself provides the benefit, while “musictherapy” indicates that the relationship between the music therapist and thepatient, and also a specific music process that the patient is involved in (suchas singing), provides the benefit.Research demonstrates that melatonin (a hormone best known for regulating sleepcycles) increased in a four-week music therapy program with Alzheimer'spatients.19 [part0028.html#fn.019]In addition, adding stimulating and familiar background music to Alzheimer'spatient's environments increased positive behaviors (calmness, relaxation, etc.)while decreasing negative behaviors (aggression, anxiety, etc.).20[part0028.html#fn.020]As we saw in the example of Henry in chapter 3 [part0012_split_001.html#c03], anAlzheimer's patient, patients have also been able to recall more personalmemories after listening to music that related specifically to their lives.MUSICAL PRESCRIPTIONIf you are looking to assist someone with Alzheimer's using music, find out whattype of music he or she enjoys or has previously enjoyed. If the person isunable to tell you, see if any friends, relatives, or loved ones can providemore information.Just as with traditional medicine, the prescription dosage is important. Startout with three or four songs played at various intervals during the day, astolerated. Play the music at a low volume that will be comfortable. Fine-tunethe playlist based on his or her reaction. If there is a song that the persondoesn't like or that triggers negative emotions or behaviors, replace it withanother one. Watching Alive Inside, the movie that chronicles the Alzheimer'spatient Henry, can also be really helpful.If someone in your life is affected by Alzheimer's, you know it can bedevastating. For caretakers, affirmations are a way to voice and release theanxiety of a situation and transform it into a more positive emotion. Preparingyourself with a thirty-second afirmation can transform a potentially negativevisit into a bonding experience on another level. Remember, words carryvibration, so before going to see the patient, place your hands on your heartand use this affirmation if it resonates with you. (Feel free to substitute thewords in bold italic to make it more specific to your situation.)I recognize the breath and heartbeat within Mom and appreciate who she is inthis moment. I see beyond the anger and cherish her sense of humor within.SUGGESTED MUSIC“The Summer Wind” by Frank Sinatra—That big band sound has been utilized withAlzheimer's patients to evoke positive memories—and who better to try than FrankSinatra?"},{"pageContent":"ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is defined by inattention,impulsivity, and/or hyperactivity. Research indicates that music can increasethe production of dopamine, a messenger chemical produced in the brain (that canbe deficient in many ADHD sufferers) that works with attention, memory, andmotivation with no harmful side effects.21 [part0028.html#fn.021]MUSICAL PRESCRIPTIONListen to music that provides a strong sense of rhythm. It can assist inproviding a focal point. Allow the person with ADHD to choose his or her ownmusic whenever possible. If you are working with someone who chooses music thatis not your typical taste, stay open to the possibility that it may still behelpful. Pop songs offer a sense of structure with verses, choruses, bridges,and endings. Strong choruses create the feeling of knowing what is coming next.This can provide an invitation for participation and help to release unfocusedenergy.SUGGESTED MUSIC“Just the Way You Are” by Bruno Mars—I suggest this song because it has verydistinct sections that the listener can focus on. In addition, the positivemessage of not having to change who you are to be amazing is a powerful messagefor people who have this disorder.For winding down at bedtime, utilize more relaxing, calming music. I recommend“Adagio for Sleep” by Liquid Mind. The angelic opening chords and long, peacefultones of this piece invite the mind to surrender. It gently leads the listenerto make a seamless transition from the mind busyness of the day into windingdown to a more serene state for the evening."},{"pageContent":"AUTISMAutism can impair a person's ability to regulate, understand, and communicatehis or her emotions. The use of traditional language can be limiting when tryingto express emotion. Music, on the other hand, can access an array of emotionseven without using words.Research points out that music is an alternative way for people with autism toaccess and communicate their emotions with less difficulty.22[part0028.html#fn.022]Once someone has had an experience and new connection to emotional understandingthrough music, he or she has an anchor for future emotional understanding tooccur.Over the last ten years, I have received many testimonials from people who haveutilized my music to benefit clients or patients with autism. I pass these on inthe hope that they will be of benefit to you.FROM FRUSTRATION TO HUGSRecently I was working with an eleven-year-old autistic boy. We were trying torecreate situations that create frustration and subsequent “meltdowns.” When Iasked him why he wasn't feeling frustrated, my client told me that it was themusic. I was playing Barry's CD, Home, in the background.My client said he felt it in his brain and ears. I asked him if he knew aboutchakras. When he said he didn't, I encouraged him to “scan” his body and I tookhim through the seven chakra areas in his body while suggesting he feel for themusic or any other sensations deep inside, yet not where the organs are. Hepointed to the areas corresponding to the solar plexus and abdominal chakras andsaid he felt a “thrumming” that calmed him. I suggested that maybe the musicconnected the physical (brain, ears) with the inner (upper and lower abdomen)and he agreed. He looked so peaceful! He then suggested he was finished, andwhen he left he gave me three separate long, full hugs.—Judy Lipson, MA, LPCPLAY IT ALL DAYI work with children who have disabilities, many of them severe. I find that theAmbiology 5: Eden CD is very helpful with my autistic and emotionally disabledchildren. They actually are learning to relax with its help.One of my autistic, emotionally disturbed students usually vehemently dislikesmusic. He covers his ears with his hands, screams, and cries when he hears it.He is, however, actually asking me specifically for the Eden CD and wants it tobe played all day!—Willa Ficarra, speech-language therapistMUSICAL PRESCRIPTIONAutism is a spectrum disorder. Choose music that is simple for severe cases, andmore complex and variable music for mild to moderate cases.23[part0028.html#fn.023]Cater the music to the person's tastes. If possible, try to make him or her partof the process to find favorite songs and genres. Start with lower volume levelsand work your way up gradually.You might find that the person you are working with is more sensitive tospecific frequencies. In my experience, pieces of music with a lot of bass (low)or treble (high) sounds may be disturbing. Play all music in small increments totest his or her initial response. Slowly increase the duration of the music ifthere is a positive response.If you are looking to increase his or her emotional understanding through music,pick a song that symbolizes the emotion of being happy and another thatsymbolizes being sad. Use this as a starting point for music as a translator ofemotions.SUGGESTED MUSICFor translating emotions into music, try using the songs below to represent thefeelings of happiness and sadness respectively: * “Happy” by Pharrell Williams * “Symphony No. 6 in B Minor” by Tchaikovsky * Light from Assisi by Richard Shulman to create calmness * Bonus for caretakers: “So It Goes” from the Songs for Autism campaign, which paints a touching picture of those affected by autism and their loved ones."},{"pageContent":"BEREAVEMENT AND GRIEFLosing a loved one can be one of the most spiritually challenging situations weexperience.

The song wascalled “Hey Daddy,” and it expressed the regret of not knowing the little thingsabout my dad that I had never asked. It also created an intimacy at the funeralthat was touching and comforting for all that attended.At times, music can support us in expressing our grief, and other times it canact as a pausing mechanism to allow us to rest and rejuvenate from a veryemotionally draining process. Paying tribute to the person who has passedthrough music and song can be a very powerful and beneficial process.MUSICAL PRESCRIPTIONCreate your own ceremony utilizing music, sound, and vibration to honor theperson who has passed. Choose a song that assists you in remembering that personand that speaks of his or her qualities—a song you know he or she loved or onethat held a connection between the two of you.Set your environment to make it feel special, or choose a significant place.Before playing the song, place your hand on your heart and gently breathe in andout. Be thankful for your vital heartbeat and breath. As you play the song,thank the person for the ways he or she touched your life. Know that you canstill entrain with the essence of that person although his or her physical bodyis no longer here. Allow your feelings to flow. The sound of crying is apowerful vehicle for releasing and transforming grief. As you honor this person,you also honor yourself and the relationship that was shared between you.If you feel you need more help, professional musical therapy is anotherexcellent way to process loss.Songwriting, lyric writing, singing in a group, and playing instruments togethercan assist in releasing and moving through emotions. It's not about being aprofessional musician, it's about using the process as a tool to explore,release, and transform grief.SUGGESTED MUSIC“Europa (Earth's Cry Heaven's Smile)” by Carlos Santana is one of the mostemotional guitar instrumentals you will ever listen to. The song starts off verygently and brings in a sense of safety that allows for surrender.

Researchindicates that music can be a vital aspect of stress management by reducingstress hormones.43 [part0028.html#fn.043] Make sure to add music to your dailyprogram to help reduce stress. Give yourself musical interludes during which youcan unwind, relax, and release the stress you carry with you throughout yourday.MUSICAL PRESCRIPTIONWe all have stress in our life. It's about how we respond to it. You have theability to “compose” yourself and guide anxiety and pressure in a differentdirection. Take a five-minute vacation, surrender and explore. People relievestress in different ways. Some people love to move and dance, some need to sitstill to calm down. Do what feels best for your four bodies, and follow the beatof your inner drum—your heart! It knows what you need in this moment, so don'tforget to listen to it.SUGGESTED MUSIC * “Stir It Up” by Bob Marley—Take a joyous trip to Jamaica, sway to the gentle breeze, and surrender. * “El Cantante” by Marc Anthony—Stand up and move to these beautiful Latin salsa rhythms. * “What the Pipa Says” by Lin Hai & Friends—Relax and float into this beautiful exotic Chinese instrumental and allow it to wash away your stresses."},{"pageContent":"STROKEThe World Health Organization reports that approximately 15 million people havestrokes each year, 5 million die, and another 5 million are disabledpermanently.According to the National Aphasia Association, 25–40 percent of people whosurvive a stroke develop a condition known as aphasia, which results from injuryor damage to the language parts of the brain and can affect the person's abilityto speak, write, and understand language. In some cases a person can still singbut cannot speak.The curiosity of how music could assist with this issue led to the developmentof musical intonation therapy, which uses melody and rhythm to engage specificareas of the brain. A promising study indicated that music may be teaching thebrain to reorganize itself as discussed in previous chapters. Thisreorganization seems to support music's ability to help pave the way for speechin stroke patients.44 [part0028.html#fn.044] In addition, research reports that“piano training can result in sustainable improvements in upper extremityfunction in chronic stroke survivors.”45 [part0028.html#fn.045]MUSICAL PRESCRIPTIONCognition can be improved through rhythm games, musical performances, andsongwriting.46 [part0028.html#fn.046] Playing a drum can help to improvemovement and muscle control in a stroke survivor, and can also enhance the rangeof motion in the upper extremities. To improve speech and communication, tryexercising mouth muscles, rhyming, or chanting and singing words, using theseabilities to gain speech improvements.SUGGESTED MUSICWell-known songs that are remembered easily, such as “Happy Birthday” or “JingleBells,” are a great start because the melodic aspects are already familiar. Forsongs that provide strong rhythms, encourage the person to clap, stomp his orher feet, or drum along. I recommend “We Will Rock You” by Queen and “HollabackGirl” by Gwen Stefani, which both have infectious rhythms that encourageparticipation."},{"pageContent":"MOVING FORWARD WITH MUSICAL PRESCRIPTIONSThere is continuing and exciting new research being reported on utilizing music,sound, and vibration to enhance our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritualhealth on a daily basis.

All of us have situations that comeinto our days that challenge us to either open our hearts and truly experiencethe emotions of the situation or numb ourselves. When we allow ourselves toexperience the emotions, our heart expands, even though it may be painful. Whenwe numb ourselves, the emotions eventually surface in one way or another for usto deal with. When we are in the midst of these transformational yet difficultexperiences, do we underestimate the true potential of music to lead us backhome to our hearts?As I was writing this book, music has led me back home to my heart many times. Ifound myself re-implementing many tools I had put on the backburner andrelearning many important lessons. You may have heard the saying “We teach whatwe need to learn most.” Before this book was finished, I discovered this to betrue. I still had at least one more major lesson to learn on my own.With two weeks left to hand in my manuscript, I got a call from my sister thatmy ninety-one-year-old mom was very ill. I flew back to New Jersey to be withher and my family. When I got there, my mom was in critical care. My sister andI would sit on opposite sides of the bed, each one of us holding a separatehand, each one of us experiencing my mom's passing in a different way. Her smallhands and frail fingers would grasp mine. I remember thinking these were thesame fingers that guided my fingers over the piano as I sat in musical awe forthe first time when I was two years old. These were the fingers that opened thedoor to my musical life.Although my mom did not consider herself a musician, she loved music. There wasa part of me that did not realize how much. I was surprised when my sister toldme that two weeks prior my mom had informed her that when she died and hercasket was being placed in the grave she wanted us to play Chopin's “NocturneOpus 9 Number 2.”Two nights before my mom passed, she seemed to get a bit better and was verycognizant. As my sister and I sat with her, she could not really talk but wasable to write us notes on a chalkboard. She communicated that she was worriedabout paying her bills. When my sister told her they were taken care of, sheeven knew how much of a credit the electric company owed her. The next night wasnot as good. My mom lost the ability to breathe on her own and passed the nextmorning. My sister, my nephew, and I were all in the room. I played some softmusic for her and could feel her hand let go of mine. . . . Mom was gone.Many months later, I was composing music live with Dr. Joe Dispenza at aworkshop with over five hundred people. During one of the meditations, I felt mymom's energy. It's hard to explain, but it was as if she was sitting down nextto me and placing her fingers on top of mine, guiding the musical notes Iplayed, like she did the very first time. It was a very powerful experience.It was the meditation right before lunch, and as the crowd cleared the roomafter it was completed I decided to stay and integrate for a moment. Theaudiovisual team played recorded music during the lunch break and I just allowedmyself to relax with it. The next song came on and I felt moved by it and feltit move through me. I recognized it as Chopin's “Nocturne Opus 9 Number 2.” Ibegan to tear up. Mom was with me. She would always be there in this song. Wewould always be connected through music.As I write the closing notes of this book, I am listening to this piece. I amfeeling her heart, and I know she is feeling mine. There was a reason this bookwas finished after her passing. It is a powerful remembrance of the power ofmusic to heal, transform, and touch our souls at the deepest level. To tell useverything is all right, no matter how painful. Our hearts can grow and expandthrough the pain if we allow them to. Like the twelve-year-old boy I was manyyears ago, sitting on the edge of his bed composing his first songs in bliss,music has elevated me once again and truly has created healing. Embrace musicfully into your life, truly hear the secret language of the heart, and your lifewill be forever changed. And so it is. . . ."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSI AM SO THANKFUL to be able to share The Secret Language of the Heart.
