From the level of the atom to the levelof our bodies to the level of the galaxies, Dawson Church’s painstaking researchshows that mind is profoundly creative. Synthesizing hundreds of studies in thefields of biology, physics, and psychology, he shows that moment by moment, theenergy fields of our brains are literally creating reality. These insights canhave a radical effect on your health and prosperity, and I highly recommend youapply them in your life.”— John Gray, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Men Are from Mars, WomenAre from Venus“We have entered an era of healing in which the influence of consciousness inhealth and illness is being validated as never before. For a view of thesecrucial insights, researcher Dawson Church’s Mind to Matter is invaluable.”— Larry Dossey, M.D., author of One Mind: How Our Individual Mind Is Part of aGreater Consciousness and Why It Matters“Dawson Church’s careful scientific work shows that the Law of Attraction isn’tjust a metaphysical proposition—it’s a scientific reality. Drawing from hundredsof studies, and illustrated with inspiring real-life stories, it demystifies theintricate mechanisms by which thoughts become things. As the boundaries of whatyou believe is possible for your life are stretched by Dawson’s work, they maynever snap back to their old shape.”— Marci Shimoff, #1 New York Times best-selling author of Happy for No Reason“I love this book. It constantly fascinated me with delicious facts and so manycaptivating stories. And it is wonderful to see science catching up with whatthe shamans and sages have always known!”— Donna Eden, author of Energy Medicine“Once in a long while, a profoundly disruptive vision shatters the scientificparadigm, refocuses the entire way we see the world, and opens up vast newhorizons of human potential. For our generation, this book is that vision.”— Raymond Aaron, New York Times best-selling author of Chicken Soup for theParent’s Soul“Dawson Church has again proven himself to be one of the great thinkers of ourtime, demystifying the most complex principles in the universe that influenceour lives, with a story-telling ability that makes it all fun and easy tounderstand. By weaving eye-opening research into engaging, heart-warmingstories, an awareness emerges of the power your own mind has to not only directyour life but influence the collective consciousness of the universe itselfwhich binds us together as one.”— Robert Hoss, co-author of Dreams That Change Our Lives; Director, DreamScienceFoundation“This groundbreaking book presents the exciting new scientific evidencedemonstrating that our thoughts have a direct impact on the world around us, andit shows us how to harness this knowledge for joyful and effective lives.”— David Feinstein, Ph.D., co-author of Personal Mythology“I believe that Mind to Matter is one of the most important books ever written.Chapter after chapter it shows us how we are masters of our bodies and the worldaround us. It’s filled with mind-blowing research that has completely changedthe way I approach my life. The results I’m getting by applying the techniquesare astonishing. They can transform your mind and the world of matter aroundyou. I can’t recommend this book highly enough.”— Matt Gallant, author of Triple Your Productivity“Mind to Matter challenges the core principles of modern medicine andconventional science. Dawson Church makes a compelling case that the mind/bodylink is more profound than we ever suspected, and that science must expand itsparadigm to include forces like consciousness, resonance, and energy. Profuselyillustrated, the book includes an impressive compendium of research citations,from classic papers to recent breakthroughs. Many practical examples andexercises provide tools to work on our own personal transformation and, if thebook’s thesis of interconnection is correct, our social transformation as well.I highly recommend this book.”— Eric Leskowitz, M.D., Department of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School“Dawson Church has been a pioneer in the field of healing for decades, hisresearch far ahead of its time. His book Mind to Matter is perfectly timed foran era in which people are opening up to the science and research behind energytechniques. Dawson offers a brilliant and insightful guide to how our thoughtscreate our reality. Packed with fascinating history from the dawn of evolutionto the latest brain research, his work is a blueprint for both experts andnon-professionals looking for effective healing strategies. Dawson succinctlyshows us not just that these methods work, but the empirical basis for how theywork. If you have ever wanted to learn the science of manifestation and how yourthoughts affect your material world, this book is a must-read. It will changeyour thoughts, and applying these principles every day will in turn change yourreality. The question is—what will you create after you read it?”— Peta Stapleton, Ph.D., School of Psychology, Bond University, Australia“Many in our culture are shifting from powerless victims to powerfulco-creators. Yet as this evolutionary impulse toward greater power emerges, weare coming face to face with what happens when power is abused. As we faceglobal crises of unpredictable proportions, we need heart-based creators of deepintegrity in touch with their power now more than ever. What would be possiblein our lives and on our planet if we connected our power with our hearts? Whatdoes science have to say about such manifesting power? Mind to Matter exploresthis edge of how our power to participate in the co-creation of realityfunctions from the scientific perspective. It also calls us out on how to avoidoverstating our human power, as so many ‘law of attraction’ books mistakenlypromise. As our power grows, we are called to acknowledge with humility theparadoxical nature of how powerful we are as creators, yet how uncontrollablethe great Mystery really is. May those who read this book step fully into theirpower, their hearts, and their integrity, and may the world be blessed by howthis book affects you.”— Lissa Rankin, M.D., New York Times best-selling author of Mind Over Medicine"},{"pageContent":"image [images/ht.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"ALSO BY DAWSON CHURCHBOOKSThe Genie in Your Genes: Epigenetic Medicine and the New Biology of Intention*Soul Medicine: Awakening Your Inner Blueprint for Abundant Health and Energy*The EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques) Manual*EFT for Weight Loss*EFT for PTSD*EFT for Love Relationships*EFT for Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue*EFT for Back Pain*EFT for GolfPsychological Trauma: Healing Its Roots in Body, Brain and MemoryThe Clinical EFT Handbook Volume 1 (co-editor)*The Clinical EFT Handbook Volume 2 (co-editor)*Communing with the Spirit of Your Unborn Child*Facing Death, Finding Love*Available from Hay HousePlease visit:Hay House USA: www.hayhouse.com [http://www.hayhouse.com]®Hay House Australia: www.hayhouse.com.au [http://www.hayhouse.com.au]Hay House UK: www.hayhouse.co.uk [http://www.hayhouse.co.uk]Hay House India: www.hayhouse.co.in [http://www.hayhouse.co.in]image [images/line.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/title.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Copyright © 2018 by Dawson ChurchPublished in the United States by: Hay House, Inc.: www.hayhouse.com[http://www.hayhouse.com]® • Published in Australia by: Hay House Australia Pty.Ltd.: www.hayhouse.com.au [http://www.hayhouse.com.au] • Published in the UnitedKingdom by: Hay House UK, Ltd.: www.hayhouse.co.uk [http://www.hayhouse.co.uk] •Published in India by: Hay House Publishers India: www.hayhouse.co.in[http://www.hayhouse.co.in]Cover design: Victoria Valentine • Interior design: Riann BenderIndexer: Joan ShapiroAll rights reserved.

In my experience fromteaching audiences around the world, the moment terminology related to religion,ancient traditions, secular cultures, or even new age idealisms is spoken inpublic, audiences become divided. Yet science unifies—and thus createscommunity.Thus, when some of the principles of quantum physics (how mind and matter arerelated) and electromagnetism are combined with the latest discoveries inneuroscience and neuroendocrinology (the study of how the brain regulates thehormone system of the body), then a little psychoneuroimmunology (the study ofhow the brain, nervous system, and the immune system impact each other—that’sthe mind-body connection) is added and finally the last findings in epigenetics(the study of how the environment affects gene expression) are included in theequation, you can demystify the mystical. In doing so, you will also uncover themystery of the self and unravel the true nature of reality.All these new areas of research point the finger toward possibility. They provewe are not hardwired to be a certain way for the rest of our lives, and we arenot doomed by our genes—rather, we’re marvels of adaptability and change.Each time you learn something new, unique possibilities you were not previouslyaware of open up before you, and as a result you are changed. This is calledknowledge, and knowledge causes you to no longer see things the way they are,but the way you are. This is the process of learning, and the more you learn,the more you make new synaptic connections in your brain. And as you’ll learn inthis wonderful book, recent studies show that just an hour of focusedconcentration on any one subject doubles the number of connections in your brainrelated to that subject. The same research tells us that if you don’t repeat,review, or think about what you’ve learned, those circuits prune apart withinhours or days. Thus, if learning is making new synaptic connections, rememberingis maintaining those connections.In the research I’ve conducted with literally thousands and thousands of peopleall over the world, I now know that once a person understands an idea, aconcept, or new information—and they can turn to the person next to them andexplain that information—they are firing and wiring certain circuits in theirbrain. These circuits add new stitches into the three-dimensional tapestry oftheir brain matter, allowing them to successfully wire the circuits necessary toinitiate that new knowledge into a new experience. In other words, once you canremember and discuss the new model of understanding, you are beginning toinstall the neurological hardware in preparation for an experience.The more you know what you’re doing and why, the easier the how gets. That’s whythis is a time in history when it’s not enough to simply know—it’s a time toknow how. It makes sense, then, that your next job is to initiate the knowledgeby applying, personalizing, or demonstrating what you’ve philosophically andtheoretically learned. This means you’re going to have to make new and differentchoices—and get your body involved. And when you can align your behaviors withyour intentions, make your actions equal to your thoughts, or get your mind andbody working together, you are going to have a new experience.So if you are given the proper instructions on what to do, and you follow thedirections and perform it properly, you are going to create a new experience.Once you embrace a new experience, the new event will add to (and furtherenhance) the intellectual circuitry in your brain. This is called experience,and experience enriches the circuitry in the brain. The moment those circuitsorganize into new networks in the brain, the brain makes a chemical. Thatchemical is called a feeling or an emotion. That means the instant you feelfreedom, abundance, gratitude, wholeness, or joy from that novel event, nowyou’re teaching your body chemically to understand what your mind hasintellectually understood.It’s fair to say, then, that knowledge is for the mind and experience is for thebody. Now you are beginning to embody the truth of that philosophy. In doing so,you’re rewriting your biological program and signaling new genes in new ways.That’s because new information is coming from the environment. As we know fromepigenetics, if the environment signals new genes, and the end product of anexperience in the environment is an emotion, you are literally signaling the newgenes in new ways. And since all genes make proteins and proteins areresponsible for the structure and function of your body (the expression ofproteins is the expression of life), you are literally changing your geneticdestiny. This suggests that it’s quite possible your body can be healed.If you can create an experience once, you should be able to do it again. If youcan reproduce any experience repeatedly, eventually you will neurochemicallycondition your mind and body to begin to work as one. When you’ve done somethingso many times that the body knows how to do it as well as the mind, it becomesautomatic, natural, and effortless—in other words, a skill or a habit. Onceyou’ve achieved that level, you no longer have to consciously think about doingit. That’s when the skill or habit becomes the subconscious state of being. Nowit’s innate and you’re beginning to master that philosophy. You have become thatknowledge.This is how common people around the world are beginning to do the uncommon. Indoing so they are transitioning from philosopher to initiate to master; fromknowledge to experience to wisdom; from mind to body to soul; from thinking todoing to being; and from learning with their head to practicing it by hand andknowing it by heart. The beauty of it is, we all have the biological andneurological machinery to do this.The side effect of your repeated efforts will not only change who you are, butit should begin to create possibilities in your life that reflect your efforts.Why else would you do it? What do I mean when I say possibilities? I’m talkingabout healing from diseases or imbalances of the body as well as the mind;creating a better life by consciously directing energy and attention into a newfuture—the manifestation of new jobs, new relationships, new opportunities, andnew adventures—equal to our ability to imagine it; and initiating mysticalexperiences that literally transcend language.It makes sense that when the synchronicities, coincidences, and newopportunities appear in your life, you’ll pay attention to what you have beendoing and it should inspire you to do it again. That’s how you go from being thevictim in your life to being the creator of your life.And that’s what this powerful book is all about. Mind to Matter is your personalguide to prove to yourself how powerful you truly are when you organize yourthoughts and feelings into coherent states. It was written for you to not justintellectually understand the content but to consistently use the practices andapply them to your life so that you reap the rewards of your efforts.It’s no short order to create a scientific model of understanding that suggeststhat our subjective mind (our thoughts) can influence our objective world (ourlife), never mind write a book about it. Finding the research alone is a task inand of itself. And yet, my dear friend and colleague Dawson Church has takenthis task on in this fantastically well-written book.I’d like to tell you a bit about Dawson Church. I met Dawson at a conference inPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, in 2006. The moment we met, there was an instantconnection. I quickly realized when we first were introduced that this was goingto be a long and healthy friendship. The energy from the exchange of ideasbetween us felt like a thunderstorm. And every time we talked about something weboth believed to be true, it was like lightning struck. We were both changedfrom our first interaction. Since then, we have worked together on severaldifferent projects. Not only has Dawson published several of his ownwell-researched studies on energy psychology, but he has been part of myresearch team that has been busy quantitatively measuring the effects ofmeditation on the brain and the body. He has impeccably led several of ourstudies and he has become the voice of reason in our research.Dawson is one of those people I can e-mail or call and ask, How long does ittake for trauma to consolidate in the brain as a long-term memory? And hewill—without hesitation—tell me the exact time it takes, the best reference, theparticular research studies as well as the scientists who conducted thosestudies. It’s as if he were giving me directions to the local supermarket. WhenI discovered this, that’s when I realized I was not working with an averagescientist, I was in the presence of a super mind. Dawson is brilliant,charismatic, loving, and full of life. He and I share a passion—to understandand to know more about who we really are and what is possible for human beings,especially during these present times of change.I loved reading this book because it provided answers to some of my own personalquestions about the relationship between mind and the material world as well asthe connection between energy and matter. I learned new concepts and it helpedme see the world differently. I was changed from my time reading it. It is myhope that not only will it change you and help you to see the world differently,but it will also inspire you to apply the principles so that you embody thetruth of what is possible for you in your life. If science is the new languageof mysticism, then you are learning from a contemporary mystic—my dear friendDawson Church. He wants you to become your own mystic too and to prove toyourself that your thoughts matter—they literally become matter.Dr. Joseph Dispenza [content-toc.xhtml#t1]New York Times best-selling authorof You Are the Placebo: Making Your Mind Matter"},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION [content-toc.xhtml#t2]Metaphysics Meets Science [content-toc.xhtml#t2]Thoughts become things. This is manifestly true. I am sitting on a chair rightnow. It began as a thought in someone’s mind—every detail of it. The frame, thefabric, the curves, the color.Thoughts become things. This is manifestly untrue. I will never be a quarterbackfor the National Football League, no matter how earnestly I think about it. Iwill never be 16 years old again. I will never pilot the starship Enterprise.Between the ways in which thoughts become things and the ways in which thoughtscan never become things there is a wide middle ground.This book explores that middle ground.Why? We want to be able to create to the outermost limits of our thought,expanding our lives to the limits of our potential. We want to be as happy,healthy, wealthy, wise, fulfilled, creative, and loved as possible. We alsodon’t want to chase pipe dreams, thoughts that are never going to become things.When we apply the rigorous standards of science to the inquiry, that middleground turns out to be enormous. Research shows us that with thought, useddeliberately, we can create things beyond the ordinary.The idea that thoughts are things has become a meme in popular culture. It’sheld as a firm proposition in metaphysics, and some spiritual teachers ascribeinfinite powers to the mind. Yet there are clearly limits to human creativeabilities; I cannot manifest an aircraft carrier simply by thinking about one. Icannot become Indonesian, jump over Mount Everest, or turn lead into gold.New discoveries in epigenetics, neuroscience, electromagnetism, psychology,cymatics, public health, and quantum physics, however, are showing that thoughtscan be profoundly creative. The page or device on which you now read these wordsbegan as a thought. So did democracy, the bikini, space travel, immunization,money, the four-minute mile, and the assembly line.THE SCIENTIST VERSUS THE MYSTICScience and metaphysics are generally considered to be polar opposites. Scienceis experimental, practical, rigorous, empirical, materialistic, objective, andintellectual. Metaphysics is spiritual, experiential, abstract, mystical,ephemeral, internal, irreplicable, imprecise, subjective, otherworldly,impractical, and impossible to prove. Science studies the world of matter whilemetaphysics seeks to transcend it.I have never perceived science and metaphysics as separate and have delighted inbeing both a mystic and a scientific researcher. When I bring the rigor ofscience to the questions of consciousness, each illuminates the other.This book examines the science behind the creative powers of the mind. Itreviews the studies that show, step-by-step, exactly how our minds creatematerial form. As each piece of the puzzle falls into place, the science turnsout to be even more astonishing than the metaphysics.This book is also full of case histories—real, up close, authentic personalaccounts of people who had an experience of mind-into-matter. Drawn from theworlds of medicine, psychology, sports, business, and scientific discovery,these stories run the gamut from profound to inspiring to heart-wrenching. Theyshow us that thoughts can become things in ways that stretch the fabric of ourspace-time reality.KEYS IN THE OCEANIn 2004, I faced a tight deadline to finish my book The Genie in Your Genes. Thematerial, on how our emotions turn genes on and off in our bodies, wasfascinating. But finding the time to research and write an emotionally engagingyet scientifically impeccable text—amid the demands of my busy life as a singledad, the owner of two businesses, and a doctoral candidate—was a challenge.I decided to flee to Hawaii for two weeks for a writing intensive. I booked aroom at the Prince Kuhio condo complex, a funky 1950s relic on the beach inPoipu, Kauai. I rented a Jeep Wrangler so I would have a rugged four-wheel-drivevehicle to reach more remote beaches and a place to store my snorkeling gear.That way I could swim each day as well as apply myself to completing theproject.One bright, sunny day, I went for a swim at a gorgeous spot called Lawai Beach.Five hundred feet long, with a turtle colony in a reef 300 feet from shore and ahealthy population of tropical fish, it was one of my favorite places. I grabbedmy snorkeling gear out of the Jeep, locked up, pocketed the keys, and jumped inthe water. An hour later, after swimming all over the bay, wet and happy, Irinsed my goggles and flippers to put them back in the car.When I reached into my pocket for the keys, it was empty.Could I have dropped them on the path from the car to the beach? I retraced mysteps, looking over every inch of ground. I sifted through the sand between theroad and my entry point to the water. Nothing.The only possible conclusion was that my keys had fallen out of my pocketsomewhere in the bay. Not only did the key ring hold the car keys, I’d clippedthe apartment keys to it as well. I was now locked out of both the car and thecondo.I decided not to panic. I centered my consciousness in my heart, and I imaginedthe keys gently drifting back to me. Then I dove into the water and startedswimming with a purpose. I was determined to find those keys.The bay covered about 150 square yards or meters, and the coral on the bottomwas 6 to 12 feet down. It twisted into thousands of colorful crannies, andfinding something as tiny as a key ring seemed impossible.I worked my way systematically back and forth across the bay, searching eachyard intently. My head told me I was on a fool’s errand, but I kept my heartsoft and receptive. Each time my thinking brain began to panic, I refocused myconsciousness in my heart area. I certainly intended to find the keys, but Ididn’t let my thoughts take me out of the state of flow.I had searched for an hour without success, and it was getting dark. Thevisibility was dropping as the sun set, and I couldn’t see clearly down to thecoral anymore. I decided to abandon my quest and swim back to shore.Though most of the other bathers had left and the day was ending, I saw a fatherand three sons snorkeling nearby. They were diving to the bottom and coming upin turns.My intuition gave me a nudge. I swam up to them and asked, “Did you guys findanything on the bottom?” The youngest boy held up my keys.THE CHAIN OF EVIDENCE FROM MIND TO MATTERMy skeptic’s mind tells me there is a logical explanation for every piece of thekey event. I just happened to swim around looking for the keys for the exactlength of time it took the boy to find them. I just happened to turn toward theshore at the same moment the family began diving. They just happened to startdiving at the spot where my keys had fallen to the bottom. The boy just happenedto notice a tiny key ring 12 feet down in an enormous bay after the sky wasalready dark. It was all a matter of random chance.But after decades of hundreds of similar experiences, my skeptic’s mind has tothink again. How can so many highly unlikely things come together at once toproduce a desired result?They led to a quest to determine if there is any scientific link betweenthoughts and things. As a researcher who has conducted many clinical trials, theeditor of a peer-reviewed journal called Energy Psychology, and a scienceblogger for the Huffington Post, I read all or part of more than a thousandscientific studies per year. I started to see a pattern. There are multiplelinks in the chain between thought and thing, and I realized that science couldexplain many of them. I wondered if anyone had ever connected all the dots tosee just how strong the evidence was. Where was the chain strongest, and wherewere links missing?If I were to treat the idea of mind creating matter as a scientific rather thana metaphysical hypothesis, would it hold up? I began seeking out research thataddressed this question and interviewing some of the brightest minds in thefield.With mounting excitement, I realized that much of the evidence was hiding inplain sight, like pearls scattered in the sand. But no one had strung the factstogether in a necklace before. Most of the research is new, and pieces of it areastonishing.The first pearls I began to pick up from the sand were the easy ones. Researchon the human body has been going on since medieval alchemists dissectedcadavers. But recently, technology has given scientists unprecedented insightinto how our bodies work at the level of cells and molecules.Nobel Prize–winning physician Eric Kandel showed that when we pass signalsthrough a neural bundle in our brains, that bundle grows rapidly. The number ofconnections can double in just one hour of repeated stimulation. Our brains arerewiring themselves along the pathways of our neural activity in real time.As the thoughts and feelings of our consciousness are carried through our neuralnetwork, they trigger the expression of genes. These in turn trigger thesynthesis of proteins in our cells. These cellular events produce electrical andmagnetic fields that can be measured by sophisticated medical imaging devicessuch as EEG and MRI.THE 11-DIMENSIONAL UNIVERSEThe next set of pearls was more challenging. The world of quantum physics is sostrange that it confounds our conventional experience of space and time. Stringtheory posits that what we perceive as physical matter is actually composed ofstrings of energy. What we measure as heavy molecules are fast-moving energystrings, while what we experience as light molecules are energy strings that arevibrating more slowly. The closer science looks at matter, the more it lookslike pure energy.String theory requires a universe with 11 dimensions, not just the 4 required byclassical physics. How do our 4-dimensional brains contemplate 11 dimensions?Physicist Niels Bohr said, “If quantum mechanics hasn’t profoundly shocked you,you haven’t understood it yet.”Then came the pearls that connect consciousness with energy. Energy is entwinedwith consciousness on both a personal and a cosmic scale. Albert Einstein said:“A human being is a part of the whole, called by us ‘Universe,’ a part limitedin time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as somethingseparated from the rest—a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.” Whenwe begin to “free ourselves from this prison,” as Einstein phrased it, then weexpand our consciousness to “embrace all living creatures and the whole ofnature.” Our consciousness interacts with the energy of the universe.CONSCIOUSNESS AND NONLOCAL MINDPhysician Larry Dossey calls this expansive consciousness that embraces thewhole of nature “nonlocal mind.” While we live our lives in our local minds andordinary reality, we’re unconscious participants in the larger consciousness ofnonlocal mind. Moments of synchronicity like finding my keys remind me of thepresence of nonlocal mind. Dossey presents compelling evidence for the existenceof nonlocal mind and inspires us with the potential of living our local lives insynchrony with it.That’s a choice we can make in consciousness. Nobel Prize–winning physicistEugene Wigner says that “the very study of the external world led to thescientific conclusion that the content of the consciousness is an ultimatereality.” Though there are many definitions of consciousness, the one I preferis the simplest: simply being aware.The way we use that consciousness—the way we direct our awareness—producesprofound and immediate changes in the atoms and molecules of our bodies. Sciencealso shows us that our consciousness affects the material reality around us. Asour consciousness changes, so changes the world.Writing this book, I began to string the pearls together, study by study.Additional evidence began showing up in my life in the same synchronous mannerin which my lost keys had appeared. When I looked at all the pearls strungtogether in sequence, I realized that science can explain every link in thechain from thought to thing.THE DANCE OF CREATIONI am excited to share each one of these links with you. Through story andanalogy, through experiment and research, through case histories and anecdotes,we’ll trace every part of the process by which your mind creates the materialworld around you.You’ll discover that you are a potent creator, and that your thoughts lead tothings. You’ll learn how to use your mind deliberately, as a creative tool, tothink nurturing thoughts. You’ll understand how you can nudge material realityeffortlessly toward your desires. You’ll grasp just how powerful you really areand how capable you are of creating change by simply changing your mind.You’ll also discover how the process works on a grand scale, from the moleculeto the cell to the body to the family to the community to the country to thespecies to the planet to the universe. We’ll investigate the dance of creationhappening at the scale of nonlocal universal consciousness and how your localmind participates in that dance.This perspective lifts our awareness from the confines of our ordinary realityinto a vast field of potential. As we align our individual local minds with theconsciousness of the universal nonlocal mind, the beauty of the material realitywe create surpasses anything our limited local minds can even dream of.PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEAt the end of each chapter, you’ll find a list of practical exercises forimplementing the ideas of the chapter in your own life. You’ll also find a linkto an online Extended Play version of the chapter, with resources to expand yourexperience.

Her hair had a life of its own,throwing off incandescent wisps like solar flares escaping from the grip of thesun’s gravity. The bobby pins with which she attempted to confine it wereunequal to the task. Her face alternated between pinched disapproval andresigned boredom. As her students suffered through her high school biologyclasses, she managed to stamp out every trace of curiosity and wonder in us.I remember looking at line drawings of the human brain in the biology textbooksprovided by Mrs. Hughes. The whole structure was fixed and unchanging, just likeanother organ such as a liver or a heart. In the 1970s, the science Mrs. Hughestaught “knew” that the brain grew until we were roughly 17 years old. After ithad filled our skulls, it remained static for a lifetime, faithfullycoordinating the many processes of life through its network of neurons.image [images/p25.jpg]Traditional illustration of the brain.MIND AS AN EPIPHENOMENON OF COMPLEX BRAINSWe also had some idea what the mind was. As evolution produced more and morecomplex brains, going from the simple ganglia of nematode worms to the massiveprefrontal cortex that crowns the human head, mind arose. To scientists of Mrs.Hughes’s day, mind was an “epiphenomenon” of the brain’s increasing complexity.Humans could write poetry, record history, make music, and perform calculusbecause of the power of the mind residing in the brain locked inside the bonycircumference of the skull.As they say in The Big Short, “It ain’t what you don’t know that gets you intotrouble. It’s what you know for sure that just ain’t so.” Most of what scienceknew, as recorded in the biology textbooks of Mrs. Hughes’s day, like the staticbrain, just ain’t so.Our brains are on the boil. Frenetic cellular activity cycles through the brainconstantly, creating and destroying molecules and cells, whether we are awake orasleep (Stoll & Müller, 1999).Even the structure of neurons is constantly changing. Microtubules are thescaffolding that gives cells their rigidity, similar to the way girders shape abuilding. The microtubules in the brain’s nerve cells have a shelf life of just10 minutes between creation and destruction (Kim & Coulombe, 2010). That’s howquickly our brains are changing.image [images/p26.jpg]Microtubules are the rigid skeletal structures giving cells their shape.In this seething mass of activity, selected neural circuits are enhanced. Theones that grow are the ones we use. Pass an information signal repeatedlythrough a neural bundle and the bundle starts to enlarge. Just as the arms of abodybuilder get bigger as he practices lifting heavier weights, our neuralcircuits grow when we exercise them.THE SPEED OF NEURAL CHANGEStudies published in the 1990s stunned neuroscientists with findings that evenpeople in their 80s rapidly add capacity to frequently used neural circuits. OnNovember 5, 1998, the headline “news of the week” in the most prestigiousresearch journal, Science, read: “New Leads to Brain Neuron Regeneration”(Barinaga, 1998).The speed of the process caused an earthquake in the world of our scientificknowledge. When the neurons in a neural bundle are stimulated repeatedly, thenumber of synaptic connections can double in just an hour (Kandel, 1998). Ifyour house acted like your body, it would notice which lights you were turningon, and every hour it would double the amount of electrical conduit going tothat light circuit.image [images/p27.jpg]Within an hour of repeat stimulation, the number of synaptic connections in aneural pathway doubles.To obtain the raw materials to rewire the rooms in which you turned on thelights the most, your smart home would strip wiring from other sources. Ourbodies do the same. Within three weeks of inactivity in an existing neuralsignaling pathway, the body starts to disassemble it in order to reuse thosebuilding blocks for active circuits (Kandel, 1998).INCREASING THE MASS OF THE BRAIN’S MOST USED REGIONSThis process of neural plasticity is evident when we learn new mechanical orintellectual skills. Take an adult education class in Russian at your communitycollege; by the end of the first hour, you’ve already learned a few words. Bythe end of a year of practice, you’ve built up those neural bundles enough tospeak simple Russian sentences without conscious effort.Or you might decide that chess is a mental challenge that will keep your mindsharp into old age and start playing. At first, you’re terrible; you can’tremember whether it’s the castle or the knight that moves diagonally. But aftera few games, you move the pieces around purposefully and even develop plans forlong-term strategies.image [images/p28.jpg]Youngster engrossed in a chess match.Maybe you decide you’d like to manage your money better. You take a look at yourretirement plan statements and notice that under the tender loving care of yourfund manager, they’ve been growing at 2 percent a year. Someone’s getting richhere, but it’s certainly not you. You think you might do better on your own, soyou take an online course in stock market investing. At first, even the languageseems baffling. What’s a covered call? How is return on investment (ROI)different from return on equity (ROE)?Your first few trades might not make money. But after looking at charts andreading investment news for a few months, you gain confidence and discover thatyou’re getting better at the money game.Whether you’re learning a new language, mastering a new hobby, navigating a newrelationship, grappling with a new job, or starting a meditation practice, yourbrain’s process of building and unbuilding is at work. You’re adding capacity tothe neural circuits you’re using the most actively, while old ones wither away,a process called pruning.Eventually, whole regions of the brain that are being actively used start togain mass. With MRI scans, researchers are able to measure the volume of eachpart of a living human brain. They find that people who use their memoryactively, like London cabbies who navigate a tangle of ancient streets, have alarger volume of tissue in the hippocampus, a part of the brain responsible formemory and learning. Dancers develop more mass in the part of the brain thatmanages proprioception, the holographic understanding of the body’s location inspace.Your mind is constantly making decisions, such as whether to enroll in thatRussian class or join the chess club. What the mind does then determines whichbrain circuits are engaged. The neural pathways in the brain that the mind’schoices stimulate are the ones that grow. In this way, the mind literallycreates the brain.image [images/p29.jpg]Patient in an MRI machine.MINDFULNESS CHANGES THE BRAIN OF A SKEPTICAL TV JOURNALISTGraham Phillips, Ph.D., is an Australian astrophysicist and TV journalist.Skeptical about feel-good techniques like meditation, he decided to putmeditation to the test (Phillips, 2016). In his words, “I’d never reallycontemplated whether meditation could do anything for me. But the more I hearabout the research, the more keen I am to see whether it has any effect. So I’mgoing to try it myself for two months. . . . For me, to take meditationseriously, I need some hard evidence that it’s changing my brain for thebetter.”Before he began, he was evaluated by a team at Monash University led bybiological psychology professor Neil Bailey, Ph.D., and clinical psychologistRichard Chambers, Ph.D. They put him through a battery of tests to evaluate hismemory, reaction time, and ability to focus. They also used an MRI to measurethe volume of each region of his brain, especially those responsible for memoryand learning, motor control, and emotional regulation.After just two weeks of practicing mindfulness meditation, Phillips felt lessstressed and more able to handle the challenges of his job and life. He reportedthat he “notices stress but doesn’t get sucked into it.”Eight weeks later, he returned to Monash for testing. Bailey and Chambers putPhillips through the same battery of tests again. They found that he was betterat behavioral tasks, even though he showed diminished brain activity. Theresearchers noted that his brain had become more energy efficient. It showed anoverall decrease in neural activity, doing a better job but exerting lessenergy. His memory tests also improved.His reaction time to unexpected events had been cut by almost half a second.Phillips imagined the benefits, such as a quicker reaction time if a pedestriansteps out in front of him when he’s driving on a busy street.One of the brain regions the researchers measured was the hippocampus. Theylooked especially at the dentate gyrus, the part of the hippocampus responsiblefor regulating emotion in other parts of the brain. It exerts control over thedefault mode network, the part of the brain that’s active when we aren’t engagedin a task. They found that the volume of nerve cells in the dentate gyrus hadincreased by 22.8 percent.That’s an enormous change. Such brain reconfiguration is occasionally seen inyoung people whose brains are still growing, but it is rarely seen in adults.The change in Phillips’s brain indicated a dramatically increased ability toregulate emotions. Psychological tests showed that Phillips’s cognitiveabilities had increased by several orders of magnitude as well.There are many studies showing that meditation changes the structure of thebrain. A review of the research on mindfulness-style meditation was published inthe prestigious journal Nature Reviews Neuroscience. It found 21 studies inwhich participants were placed inside MRI machines to measure the volume of eachpart of their brain before and after meditation, just like Graham Phillips.This accumulation of a large body of evidence identified neural growth in“multiple brain regions . . . suggesting that the effects of meditation mightinvolve large-scale brain networks.” The review found increases in the volume of“brain regions involved in attention control (the anterior cingulate cortex andthe striatum), emotional regulation (multiple prefrontal regions, limbic regionsand the striatum) and self-awareness (the insula, medial prefrontal cortex andposterior cingulate cortex and precuneus)” (Tang, Hölzel, & Posner, 2015).image [images/p31.jpg]Brain regions in which neural growth occurs as a result of meditation.WHAT EMOTIONAL REGULATION CAN DO FOR YOULike the brain of Graham Phillips, your brain is rewiring itself constantly. Thebrain adds neural capacity to regions you exercise. Choose a differentexperience, like meditation, and your brain begins working differently. Changeyour mind, and information starts to flow along new neural pathways in thebrain. The brain’s neurons reconfigure themselves accordingly, firing and wiringto fit the new pattern. As the mind directs, the brain responds.Let’s unpack the key elements of Graham’s story for a moment. There are five: * A 22.8 percent increase in the volume of the part of the brain responsible for emotional regulation * Enhanced brain response time, better memory, increased cognitive powers, improved behavioral abilities * A more relaxed and energy-efficient brain * Changes in the brain in just 8 weeks * No drugs, surgery, supplements, or major life changes—just mindfulnessImagine having 22.8 percent more nerve cells in your brain to handle the task ofemotional regulation. Emotional regulation may be jargon from neuroscience, butthose two words have a big impact on your daily life. Better emotionalregulation means that you’re not derailed by common challenges such as: * Getting triggered by co-workers at your job * Annoying things your spouse or partner says or does * Being startled by sudden noises or sights * The problematic behavior of your children * What politicians say and do * Being stuck in traffic * Stories in the news * The way your body looks and functions * Winning or losing at games or conflicts with others * Religious conflicts or views held by others * The stock market, your investments, and the economy * Staying calm when people around you are stressed out * Being short of time or feeling overwhelmed * The amount of money you have or expect to have * The way other people drive their cars * Your age and how your body is changing * Crowds, shopping, and close physical proximity to other people * Other people’s opinions that clash with yours * Your expectations about the way your life ought to be * The way your parents think and what they say * Having to wait in line or wait for something you want * The enviable lifestyles of movie stars and celebrities * People who make unwanted demands on your time and attention * The possessions you have or don’t have * Annoying relatives you interact with at family gatherings * Random mishaps of daily life * Getting or not getting promotions, rewards, and other things you want * . . . and anything else that routinely annoys youImagine having a brain with vastly increased ability to master those challenges,preventing them from compromising your happiness. Meditation doesn’t just changeyour state—the way you feel at the moment. It changes your traits—the enduringaspects of personality engraved in your brain that govern your outlook on life.Among the positive traits fostered by meditation are greater resilience in theface of adversity, more sympathy for others, and increased compassion foroneself (Goleman & Davidson, 2017). It also leads to a greater degree ofself-regulation, making you the master of your emotions rather than a slave tothem.A classic 1972 study called the Stanford marshmallow experiment tested emotionalregulation in preschool children. A marshmallow was put in front of them, afterwhich they were left alone in a room. They were promised that they would get asecond marshmallow if they could refrain from eating the first one for 15minutes. Thirty years later, the lives of those who could regulate theiremotions were better in many ways. They achieved higher scores on college entryexams. They earned more money and created happier marriages. They had a lowerbody mass index (BMI) and fewer addictive behaviors (Schlam, Wilson, Shoda,Mischel, & Ayduk, 2013).The parts of the brain tasked with emotional regulation are also the ones thathandle working memory, as revealed by MRI scans (Schweizer, Grahn, Hampshire,Mobbs, & Dalgleish, 2013). Working memory involves awareness, enabling you toremain focused on an activity and to sort relevant from irrelevant information.When your emotions are disturbed, those parts of the brain go offline for use byworking memory. You then make poor decisions. When you learn effective emotionalregulation, as Graham Phillips did, you are able to control your emotions,freeing up the brain’s memory circuits to run your life wisely.YOUR EVERYDAY SUPERPOWERThis is the everyday superpower that you possess: second by second, you arechanging your brain by the way you use your mind. The consciousness of your mindis becoming the cells of the matter of your brain.We’re impressed when we see on-screen superheroes who can change their bodies atwill. They may develop mental brilliance, like the hero in the movie and TVseries Limitless, who takes an experimental drug called NZT that unlocks thefull potential of his brain. Or the X-Men, each one of whom has a uniquesuperpower gift.Yet you, at this very moment, possess the superpower to change your brain. Witheach thought you think, as you direct your attention, you’re signaling yourbrain to create new neural connections. Use this power deliberately, rather thanallowing random thoughts to flow through your mind, and you start to consciouslydirect the formation of neural tissue. After a few weeks, your brain changessubstantially. Keep it up for years, and you can build a brain that’s habituatedto process the signals of love, peace, and happiness.This isn’t a comic book or sci-fi movie; this is your life! Changing your brainis something you’re doing every day. Now it’s time to direct the processdeliberately in a way that improves your life. Just as you upgrade the operatingsystem of your computer or smartphone, you can upgrade your brain by changingyour mind. Mind to matter.ELECTRICAL CONDUCTORS GENERATE ENERGY FIELDSTiny electrical currents run through the neurons in your brain, just like theelectricity that runs through the copper wire in the electrical cords poweringyour appliances. As a whole, the brain seethes with electrical activity. Thisproduces an energy field around the brain. When you get an MRI or EEG, medicalprofessionals can read the energy field of your brain. It’s a magnetic field inthe case of an MRI, and it’s an electrical field in the case of an EEG.Electricity and magnetism are two sides of the same coin: electromagnetism.image [images/p35.jpg]When an electric current is passed through a conductor, it produces a magneticfield. This is true whether the conductor is a power cord or a neuron.There are many other forms of energy as well, and your brain and mind areconstantly interacting with them. One of these is light. All living tissues emitphotons, or light particles, and the type and intensity of the photons they emitvary. Even individual cells emit photons. A healthy cell emits a steady stream,while a dying cell sprays out its photons all at once like the burst ofradiation from a collapsing supernova.Light, electricity, and magnetism create the energy fields used in biologicalsignaling. Biologist James Oschman states, “Energy is the currency in which alltransactions in nature are conducted” (Oschman, 2015).THE ANTENNAE IN YOUR CELLSImagine two magnets. Sprinkle iron filings around them and you’ll see the linesof energy their fields produce. The copper cords powering your appliances andthe neurons firing in your brain work the same way. They generate fields.Now place a bigger magnet nearby. It will exert an influence on the ironfilings, and the pattern of the whole energy field will change. Add an evenbigger magnet and the field shifts again. Fields within fields produce complexpatterns of energy.The neurons in your brain act like those magnets. They generate fields. Thosefields shape the matter around them, just the way the magnets cause the ironfilings to form symmetrical patterns.Bigger fields outside the body, such as the gravitational field of the Earth,act like the bigger magnets. They shift the pattern of your body’s fields. Theyact on your brain and your cells, while your body also exerts a tiny influenceon those bigger fields. Our bodies are influencing these big fields while alsobeing influenced by them.Your body’s electromagnetic field extends about five yards or meters from yourbody. When you’re five meters away from another person, your field beginsinteracting with their field. The two of you might be saying nothing, yet yourenergy fields are shaping each other in an invisible dance of communication(Frey, 1993).image [images/p36.jpg]When two people are in close proximity, their fields interact.For decades, microtubules, with their rigid form, were assumed to be no morethan structural elements of the cell. Just as your body has a skeleton thatprovides a rigid structure to which other structures of the body attach,microtubules are the girders and scaffolding of the cell.However, like antennae, microtubules are hollow. They are long cylinders. Thisproperty allows them to resonate, like a drum. And like antennae, theirstructure makes them capable of receiving signals from energy fields (Hameroff &Penrose, 1996). Microtubule signaling has been proposed as a method by which thebody’s complex systems are coordinated among trillions of cells (Oschman, 2015).THE SHAMAN AND THE CARDIAC SURGEONThe fields of your body can interact with the fields of other people at greatdistances. A former cardiac patient named Richard Geggie told me this storyduring my research for a book called The Heart of Healing (Smith, 2004):“In the early 1990s I was in Toronto, Canada. I went to see my doctor because Ifelt tired and listless. He sent me to have an electrocardiogram. Later thatday, when he got the results back, he told me that my heart was at serious risk.He told me to stay calm, not exert myself, keep nitroglycerine pills with me atall times, and to not go outside alone.“The doctors administered several tests over the course of the following threedays, and I failed them all because my arteries were severely clogged. Theyincluded an angiogram, another electrocardiogram, and a treadmill stress test.When I started the bicycle test, the clinic staff didn’t even let me finish.They stopped me partway. They were afraid I was going to die on the spot, myarteries were so clogged. As a high-risk patient, I was given an immediateappointment for heart bypass surgery.“The day before the surgery, I woke up feeling much better. I went to thehospital and I was given an angiogram. This involved shooting dye into myarteries through an injection in my thigh. The surgeons wanted to discover theexact location of the blockages prior to the operation. I was prepared forsurgery. My chest was shaved, and the doctors were about to mark my skin wherethey planned to make the incision.“When the new angiograms came back from the lab, the doctor in charge looked atthem. He became very upset. He said he had wasted his time. There were noblockages visible at all. He said he wished his own arteries looked as clear. Hecould not explain why all the other tests had shown such severe problems.“I later discovered that my friend Lorin Smith [a Pomo Indian medicine man] inCalifornia, upon hearing of my heart trouble, had assembled a group of hisstudents for a healing ceremony the day before the second angiogram. He coveredone man with bay leaves and told him that his name was Richard Geggie. For thenext hour, Lorin led the group in songs, prayers, and movement. The next day, Iwas healed.”When I last followed up, 13 years later, Geggie was still in excellent health.The phenomenon of distant healing is well documented, with scores of studiesshowing its effects (Radin, Schlitz, & Baur, 2015).DIRECTING THE FLOW OF CONSCIOUSNESSYou can direct your consciousness, the way Lorin Smith did toward RichardGeggie’s healing. Consciousness isn’t something that simply is; it’s somethingthat can be controlled and pointed in a desired direction. When you direct yourconsciousness, you harness the power of your mind, activate the splendidmachinery of your brain, and influence the environment around you (Chiesa,Calati, & Serretti, 2011).You do that in visibly obvious ways, like deciding to plant a vegetable garden.After your mind makes the decision, you use your consciousness to direct theproject. Your brain signals your body to drive your car to the local gardeningstore, where you buy fertilizer, tools, and seeds. You plant, water, and tendyour garden, and a few months later, you have a crop. Your crop began inconsciousness and ended in the material reality of a homegrown meal. A thoughteventually produced a thing.Take a look around you right now. The colors in the carpet began as a thought insomeone’s mind. That person chose the particular shades and textures that woundup in the finished product. Someone else decided the dimensions of your cellphone and laptop computer. Every proportion in your home began as a thought inthe consciousness of the builder. We use invisible fields such as cell signals,Bluetooth, and wireless networks every day. A wireless network uses a router tosend a signal into the surrounding environment. In the presence of a receiver,such as your smartphone or laptop, information is exchanged. The field of energycreated by the router makes communication possible between your laptop and everydevice accessible to the router.Though the fields are invisible, they are efficient conductors of information.Even electricity can now be transmitted wirelessly from one device to another.You also interact with your environment in invisible ways, through the energyfields in which you’re immersed. Through your brain, mind, and cells, yourconsciousness projects signals into the fields around you (Oschman, 2015).Genius inventor Nikola Tesla is often quoted as saying, “If you wish to find thesecrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.”image [images/p39.jpg]We use invisible energy fields, such as cellular networks, to transmitinformation every day.When we originate an idea in consciousness, we send signals into the universalfield. Transmission requires hardware, in the form of the brain, as well assoftware, in the form of the mind. Signals traveling through neural pathwayscreate energy fields, and those fields change depending on the content ofconsciousness. Healing involves field effects, whether local or distant.CURING MICE OF CANCERMy friend and colleague Bill Bengston, Ph.D., is a professor of sociology at St.Joseph’s College. With various teams of researchers, he has conductedprovocative experiments that demonstrate the healing potential of energy fields(Bengston, 2010).Bill started out as a skeptic. When he finished his degree in sociology in 1971,he had no time for people who claimed paranormal powers. But he was anopen-minded skeptic, and when he met healer Bennett Mayrick, he put him to thetest. Ben said there was something wrong with Bill’s car, and Bill wasdisappointed. He happened to have had the car inspected the day before, and heknew there was absolutely nothing wrong with it.Bill’s skepticism remained intact for half the drive home—when the car’s entireexhaust system crashed to the ground.Bill got to know Ben well over the next few years and eventually had anopportunity to apply real science to test Ben’s skills. Bill had joined thefaculty at City University of New York, and one of his fellow faculty members,Dave Krinsley, designed an objective experiment to measure whether human energycould produce healing (Bengston & Krinsley, 2000).The design was simple. Mice would be injected with mammary cancer, oradenocarcinoma, a procedure that had been used in scores of other studies. Incancer studies, tumors are induced in the mice, after which researchers tryvarious chemicals to see if they will alter the course of the disease. Thelongest an injected mouse had ever survived was 27 days. After injection, thecancer tumors grow rapidly in the mice, and they die in 14 to 27 days (Lerner &Dzelzkalns, 1966).The mice in Krinsley’s study would be randomized into two groups in order toprovide a control. The control mice would be kept in a different building toeliminate the possibility of healing effects due to proximity to the treatedmice.Unfortunately, the shipment of mice did not arrive at the lab on schedule. Therewere repeated delays, and Ben lost interest in the experiment, as he had otherpriorities. Dave encouraged Bill to do the healing in Ben’s stead.Eventually, the mice arrived and were injected. Bill began to hold the cage ofexperimental mice in his hands for an hour each day. His hypothesis was that ifhealing energy were real, the mice would not develop tumors in the way theynormally did.A week into the treatment, two of the mice developed visible tumors. Bill wasbitterly disappointed. When all five developed tumors, Bill asked Dave to putthe mice out of their misery, as the experiment had clearly failed.When Dave arrived, he commented on how healthy Bill’s mice appeared to bedespite the tumors. They were running around their cages, full of energy,behaving as though they were healthy. The control mice in the other lab, he toldBill, weren’t doing well. Two had already died.He argued, “Perhaps the treatments are slowing down the cancer even if theycan’t prevent it. There’s no record of a single mouse living past day 27. Getone to live 28 days and we’ll have a world record. Experiments rarely turn outthe way they’re supposed to. That’s why they’re called experiments!”Around day 17, much to everyone’s surprise, the tumors on Bill’s mice began tochange. They became ulcerated, with scabs replacing the hair on their skin. Byday 28, Bill confided to the mice that they were making history. The ulcerationsbegan to disappear and the fur grew back.image [images/p41.jpg]Mouse with tumor.A week later, Bill’s mice were examined by a biologist, who relayed the news toDave: “The mice are cancer-free.”SKEPTICISM IS NO BARRIER TO BEING A HEALERThe experiment was replicated at different times by different researchers whoextended the design in interesting ways. The research teams found that when moremice were treated, the effect was stronger. When the effect was very strong,even mice in the control group in a different building began to improve, andsome did not die (Bengston, 2007).In some studies, Bill trained graduate students to perform the healing. He chosepeople who, like himself, were skeptics. He eliminated true believers from thepool of healers.image [images/p42.jpg]The cages in which the mice were kept were held by Bill or the students.This made no difference. The mice recovered whether treated by Bill or byskeptical students. Not only did the mice recover, but they also developedimmunity to adenocarcinoma. If they were injected later, they no longerdeveloped cancer. Bill also tried treating water that was then given to themice. This was as effective as using the healing practice on the micethemselves.Bill required the students to keep notebooks describing their personalexperiences. Examination of their notes revealed that at first many of them didnot believe they were taking part in an experiment in healing. They thought thatthey, not the mice, were the subjects being studied. They believed they wereunconscious stooges being secretly tested to determine just how gullible theywere.This is called the nocebo effect. It’s the opposite of the placebo effect. Withplacebo, people’s belief that they will get better can produce a cure. Patientswith nocebo can make themselves sick through their beliefs. People who don’tbelieve in the possibility of healing, like the skeptical grad students,introduce the nocebo effect into their work.The mice had no opinions, which is what makes animals useful for studies inwhich researchers wish to eliminate the placebo effect. Bill’s skepticalstudents also didn’t believe in healing. So it wasn’t belief that was producingthe healing.The most likely explanation for the healing is energy fields. Many of thestudents, as well as Bill himself, described feeling their hands getting hot asthey felt the healing energy begin to flow. They also described a cessation ofthat feeling when the healing session was complete. They learned to discernexactly what the flow of healing energy through their hands felt like.Variants of the experiment found that distance was not an obstacle. Whether themice were in close proximity to or far from the healer did not matter. Energyhealing does not appear to be confined by the usual barriers of time and space(Oschman, 2015). Distant intentionality can be as effective as the presence of ahealer in the room (Schmidt, Schneider, Utts, & Walach, 2004).In her book The Intention Experiment, medical journalist Lynne McTaggartsummarizes six studies using EEG or MRI machines to show that healers are ableto affect the brain waves of people at a distance. She concludes that “thereceiver’s brain reacts as though he or she is seeing the same image at the sametime” (McTaggart, 2007).Bill Bengston also found that he personally was able to change the EEG of adistant human subject. After the experiments with mice, Bill began to offerenergy healing to human beings and found that tumors, whether cancerous orbenign, often disappeared.HER DOCTOR SAID: “THIS DOESN’T MAKE SENSE”Bill Bengston has recorded many case histories from his work with patients withtumors. Here’s one in which a patient’s doctors were baffled by the changes theysaw after energy healing.“Janis, who was in her 20s, had been diagnosed with ovarian torsion, which meanstwisted fallopian tubes, along with cysts, causing the ovarian tissue to die. Anoperation was scheduled, carrying with it the chance that she would becomeinfertile. After I treated her a few times . . . when Janis went for her pre-opexam, her doctor was astonished: ‘There are no growths!’“He referred her to a specialist, who was just as puzzled. He mused aloud whilelooking at her slides, ‘You’ve got growths in this photo, but they’re gone inthe next one. You’ve got twisted tubes in this photo, but now they’re gone. Thisdoesn’t make sense.’ . . . Janis’s doctors cancelled her operation” (Bengston,2010).CAN HEALING BE LEARNED?As Bill’s skeptical graduate students discovered, healing can be learned. Myfriends Donna Eden and David Feinstein manage the largest energy medicineprogram in the world, Eden Energy Medicine. Their program has over 1,000graduates. Hundreds of stories confirm that energy healing works for humans aswell as mice (Eden & Feinstein, 2008).In the 1980s, I argued that healing was a special ability that only certaingifted individuals possessed. Throughout history, there have been remarkablepeople who demonstrated verifiable healing powers.image [images/p45.jpg]Hands-on healing session.In Soul Medicine, a book I co-authored with Norm Shealy, M.D., founder of theAmerican Holistic Medical Association, we talk about several of these people(Shealy & Church, 2008). Our standard of a verifiable cure was a doctor’sdiagnosis showing that the patient had a disease, followed by a second diagnosisafter healing showing that the patient did not have that disease. Studying thesepractitioners suggested to me that healing was an unusual gift. Bill, David,Donna, and many others have proved me wrong.Energy medicine programs such as those offered by Bill and Donna now show thathealing is a skill that can be taught. Case studies written by their studentsinclude patients who have recovered from serious conditions such as cancer,heart disease, and autoimmune diseases.I founded a nonprofit called the National Institute for Integrative Healthcare(niih.org [http://niih.org]). On our website, we maintain a list of studies ofenergy healing published in peer-reviewed scientific journals. To be included onthis list, studies need to meet the following criteria: * They assess the use of hands-on healing or interventions in the body’s energy field. * They use energetic exercises or techniques to balance the body’s energy systems. * The explanation they use for the effects of treatment is based on changes to the body’s energy field.The list excludes methods such as acupuncture and EFT (emotional freedomtechniques) because these have their own online databases. Nonetheless, thereare over 600 studies on the list. If you include EFT, acupuncture, and otherenergy healing methods, there are over 1,000 studies showing that energy healingis effective for a wide range of conditions, including those listed in Table 1.Alzheimer’s HIV/AIDS Anxiety Insomnia Arthritis Irritable bowel syndrome AsthmaLow back pain Autism Memory Burnout Menstrual distress Burns Migraines CancerMood disorders Cardiovascular disease Motion sickness Carpal tunnel syndromeObesity Children’s behavioral issues Pain Cognitive impairment Post-traumaticstress disorder (PTSD) Cortisol Prostate cancer Dementia Pulmonary diseaseDepression Skin wounds Diabetes Smoking Drug addiction Stroke FibromyalgiaSubstance abuse Headache Thyroid dysfunction High blood pressureTable 1. Conditions for which energy healing has been shown to be effective.This compelling body of evidence shows that consciousness—directed by intention,working through energy fields—can produce radical changes in matter. “Skull andskin are not limiting boundaries of energy and information,” says UCLApsychiatrist Dan Siegel in his book Mind (Siegel, 2017).Though healing can occur at the level of small animals, such as mice, as well asat the level of larger animals, such as Homo sapiens, and can happen at adistance, just how large can the effect get?The answer is: very large. Whole societies have been changed by a change of mindin a single person. In every age, there are people who have asked “Why?” and“Does it have to be this way?” and “How can we do things differently?” Even whenfacing a social condition that has been unchanged for centuries, the mind of asingle person is sometimes able to change the matter of an entire society.Mind is able to change matter at the level of the very small—atoms andmolecules. Scaling up, it can change matter at the level of cells, organs, andbodies. Getting bigger still, it can change social groups and even wholecountries. There are many historical examples of people who’ve changed first atthe level of their own minds and then gone on to have an impact that shapes theworld. We’ll look at several examples of how individual mind change can scale upto produce enormous social shifts.HOW A MIND CHANGE ELIMINATED INFECTIOUS DISEASEJosephine Baker was the first woman to graduate with a doctorate in publichealth from New York University. In 1908, she was appointed head of the city’snew Bureau of Child Hygiene.She understood the link between poverty and illness and was possessed by asingle-minded desire to eliminate human suffering. She introduced many reformsin New York City (Baker, 1925).Baker instituted a program called the Little Mothers’ League to train girls 12and up in basic infant care. At a time when both parents were usually workingoutside the home, this improved the health of small children.image [images/p48.jpg]Josephine Baker.Baker standardized the dosage of silver nitrate being placed in the eyes ofnewborns to prevent syphilis. Before her innovation, there was no standard dose,and some babies were given so much silver nitrate that they went blind.She established standards for the quality of milk. At that time, the milk fed tomost youngsters was watered down and then adulterated with other substances suchas flour, starch, or chalk to make it look like the real thing.image [images/p48-1.jpg]Nineteenth-century cartoon depicting the health hazards of tainted milk.In the middle of World War I, Baker published an editorial in the New York Timesin which she calculated that the mortality rate of children in New York City washigher than that of soldiers on the Western front. This caused a sensation andhighlighted the need for public health reforms (King, 1993).Baker was determined to control the spread of typhoid fever, one of the majorkillers of both adults and children. The disease had taken the life of herfather, a factor that motivated her choice of career. With a colleague namedGeorge Soper, she began to map areas of the city marked by outbreaks of typhoid.At a time when the germ theory of disease was not yet widely accepted, her teamidentified individuals at the epicenter of each outbreak.image [images/p49.jpg]Typhoid bacillus.TYPHOID MARYOne of these individuals was Mary Mallon, an immigrant from County Tyrone inIreland. Mary served as a cook to various wealthy families. Josephine Baker andGeorge Soper discovered that wherever Mary worked, outbreaks of typhoid followedshortly thereafter. When she prepared food, she transmitted the typhoid bacillusto those who ate it.Mary was taken for evaluation and testing, and enormous quantities of thetyphoid bacillus were found in her blood. She had no symptoms herself, however,and did not believe she was sick.Though she was released on a promise to pursue a profession other than cooking,she soon went back to her old ways. Josephine Baker tracked her down again andknocked on the family’s front door with a police escort.Mary ran out the back door and eluded the police. But Josephine, more determinedthan the boys in blue, tracked her down in a neighbor’s potting shed. Mary washuddled in a corner. Josephine sat down on top of Mary and yelled for help untilthe police arrived. Typhoid Mary was out of circulation for good.image [images/p50.jpg]Typhoid Mary.Josephine Baker’s reforms were bitterly contested by the medical establishment.When her campaign against typhoid fever became successful, a group of Brooklynpediatricians petitioned the mayor to abolish her office. They complained thatthe supply of sick children to their practices was drying up.Hearings were held in Congress to stop her. She was mocked as a woman, andcritics declared that her efforts would eliminate medicine as a profession forpromising young men. Nevertheless, she persisted—and eventually prevailed. Bythe time she retired, New York had the lowest rate of infant mortality in theUnited States.Baker’s reforms spread quickly. Her standards were adopted by 35 other statesand in 1912 became the basis for the national Children’s Bureau. Within a fewyears, terrifying diseases such as smallpox, typhoid, and cholera were virtuallywiped out. That’s the power of mind change as it plays out on a large socialscale. Anthropologist Margaret Mead is famously supposed to have said, “Neverthink that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens cannot change theworld. Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.”AN IDEA WHOSE TIME HAS COMEWhen you change your mind, sending new signals through the neural pathways ofyour brain, altering the energy fields all around you, interacting with thefields of others, you have no idea how far the effect might travel.We see this in great social movements such as the abolition of slavery. In about50 years, slavery went from an institution that had been with us since the dawnof humankind to being abolished worldwide. Women’s suffrage and civil rightsfollowed the same trajectory.image [images/p51.jpg]Women’s suffrage poster.Great social movements begin in the consciousness of just a few people. Theyspread slowly at first, then propagate with accelerating speed. As Frenchnovelist Victor Hugo said, “One withstands the invasion of armies; one does notwithstand the invasion of ideas” (Hugo, 1877)—or, as it is more popularlyparaphrased, “There is nothing more powerful than an idea whose time has come.”An idea that begins in just one mind can take over the world. What are the ideaswith which you fill your consciousness every day?CREATING FROM THE INSIDE OUTIn my first career, in book publishing, I came into contact with manybest-selling authors. One day, I asked myself, What do they have in common?Reflecting on that question changed the direction of my life.One of the characteristics common to best-selling authors is a focus oncreation. They are much more interested in producing information than consumingit. The flow of words and images tends to be from the inside out, not theoutside in. They certainly read and watch videos like the rest of us. But theytend to spend much more time pouring information out of their consciousness thansucking information into their consciousness. Given a choice of reading (inflow)or writing (outflow), they write.Most people are passive. They take information in. They listen to the radio,watch shows and movies, and read the occasional book. They are consumers ofinformation rather than producers of information. They are constantly influencedby the information they are consuming.When it comes to best-selling authors, the flow of information tends to run inthe opposite direction. They are much more interested in the information theycan produce than what they can consume. They are active producers of informationrather than passive consumers of information.DELILAH AND THE INFORMATION FIELDI remember a picnic with a group of friends a few years back. One member of thegroup was a woman in her 50s named Delilah who I hadn’t seen for a couple ofyears but with whom I’d previously shared many warm conversations. She hadalways been pretty, bright, and healthy. Financially secure, she had no need towork, but she enjoyed a moderately successful career as a classical pianist.We were sitting on the grass in the park on a beautiful spring day after amorning of group free-form dance. As we talked, Delilah shared her distressabout what was happening in the world.There were a lot of problems for her to be distressed about. Wars in severalregions. Refugees. Natural disasters. Pollution. The loss of ground water. Massextinction. Rising sea levels. The poor quality of governance. Deforestation.image [images/p53.jpg]News will rarely make you happy.As we talked, I got a clear picture of the flow of information in Delilah’slife. Whenever she was driving, she had her car radio tuned to an all-newsstation; she read the newspaper daily and watched television news. Note the useof the word news three times in that sentence. She was absorbing all thisinformation from the outside world and spent much of her time engaged in theprocess.This did not make her happy. I noticed how much Delilah seemed to have agedsince our last conversation, and how heavy her energy felt as she described theflood of problems that filled her worried mind. Even though she was healthy,smart, and financially set for life, her mind was consumed by worry. She attunedher consciousness to the bad stuff, like a vacuum cleaner sucking in garbage.Filling her mind with problems led to a mind filled with garbage.The places to which she turned her attention led to Delilah’s immersion in theenergy field of bad news. Conditioned by her consciousness, her brain was busygrowing the neural circuits of stress. Her mind was guiding her brain to enhancethose neural pathways, making them larger and more efficient at carrying theirhabitual signals. With every increase in capacity, her mind became more attunedto bad news.Delilah believed that the bad things she heard on the news were happening “outthere.” She could claim with complete justification that the news items withwhich she was filling her thoughts were objectively true.Yet the truth was that she was creating her own stress-filled reality by thedirection in which she chose to turn her attention. Focusing on the news sparkedthe creation of new neurons in those circuits, which created strongerelectromagnetic fields, which in turn sensitized her further to similar signals.Her stress had as much to do with her subjective creation of mind as it did withthe objective state of the world.SELF-DIRECTED NEURAL PLASTICITYThat’s the risk you take when you’re a consumer of information rather than aproducer. When the flow of information is from the outside in, you hold yourconsciousness hostage to the consciousness of the people producing theinformation. When the container of your mind is being filled with unhappy input,it’s hard to maintain a happy state.When you allow others to fill your consciousness, you are at the mercy of theirconsciousness.My wife, Christine, also consumes information constantly. However, she choosesinspirational material. She listens to her favorite transformational speakersduring the long drives she takes to work. She reads inspirational books andwatches nature shows on television. Her family and friends share inspirationalquotes in their e-mail exchanges. She is bathing her mind in information fromthe outside, and her choice of uplifting material makes her a happy and wisepresence.That’s the place from which she then creates. She’ll tell you about an excitingnew art project she’s designed or a powerful new idea she’s learned. Those arethe things that fill her mind.The thoughts, beliefs, and ideas that fill your consciousness exert a powerfulinfluence on the world outside your brain. You are constantly creating. You canuse that power to create intangibles such as a nurturing emotional environment.You can also use that power to create tangible material conditions. There aremany examples of changes that have begun inside the mind of a single person likeJosephine Baker and expanded to change the world.LAUNCHING MIND INTO SPACEIn the sphere of technology, one person whose personal vision has reshapedentire industries is Elon Musk.Elon Musk is famous as the founder of several successful businesses, includingTesla and Solar City. He sold his first product at the age of 12. It was a gamecalled Blastar for which he’d written the code.After applying unsuccessfully for a job at Netscape and dropping out of StanfordUniversity, he founded a company called Zip2, which Compaq later purchased for$307 million. He then cofounded PayPal and cashed out when eBay purchased it.While Musk’s businesses thrived, his personal life hit some rough patches. On avacation in his native South Africa, he contracted cerebral malaria, which isfatal in about 20 percent of cases. He lost 45 pounds and had a near-deathexperience. Two years later, his first son died at the age of 10 weeks.Musk founded his third company, SpaceX, in 2002, with the audacious goal ofmaking commercial spaceflight possible.The launch of the first SpaceX rocket in 2006 ended in a fireball. Along withthe incinerated rocket went the millions of dollars Musk had put into theventure. He was undeterred, however, and afterward wrote: “SpaceX is in this forthe long haul and, come hell or high water, we are going to make this work”(Malik, 2006).The following year, the company launched its second rocket. It failed to reachorbit when the engines shut down prematurely, leaving SpaceX with two strikesagainst it, and a founder who was desperately short of cash.In the third launch, in 2008, the two stages of the rocket collided afterseparating. Its payload—which included Musk’s first cargo for NASA, as well asthe ashes of Star Trek’s James “Scotty” Doohan—wound up in the ocean.image [images/p56.jpg]SpaceX launch.Musk was now completely out of money and on the verge of bankruptcy. He wassaved only by an eleventh-hour investment from eccentric billionaire PeterThiel.Today, Musk’s companies—Tesla, SpaceX, and Solar City—are enormously successful.Yet it took perseverance through setback after setback to get to that point.Musk’s mind-set is relentlessly positive, whatever the challenge. His mind hasbeen the source of multiple game-changing material realities.WHAT WORLD WILL YOU SHAPE WITH YOUR BRAIN?What’s in your mind, and what kind of material world might you create with it?You have this magnificent brain and mind, capable of creating wealth, happiness,health, and well-being in your own life and the lives of those around you. Yourconsciousness is powerful—much more powerful than you realize.Most of us are using just a tiny fraction of our ability, not even realizingthat our minds create matter. This book is about harnessing your superpowerconsciously to make a wonderful life for yourself and those around you. You’realready turning thoughts into things. You’re doing it every day unconsciously.Now it’s time to do it systematically and deliberately.In the coming pages, you will meet many people like Josephine Baker, Elon Musk,Lorin Smith, and Bill Bengston, who have turned thoughts into things.Information flows out from them into the universal field, and theirconsciousness conditions the space around them to produce manifestations inmaterial reality.The concept that mind creates matter is not a metaphysical proposition. It’s abiological one. In the chapters ahead, you’ll begin to experience for yourselfhow your brain creates matter in the form of neurons and synapses in response toyour consciousness. Consciousness and matter interact with the fields aroundyou, and the result is material reality.You’ll begin to use your consciousness deliberately, building matter throughintention flowing from the inside rather than by accident based on what’s comingat you from the outside. You’ll discover the community of conscious people whoare building reality for the highest and best for the whole planet, and discoverthat you’re part of an enormous creative community working for good. Welcome tothe future of mind and matter!PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEActivities to practice this week: * As soon as you wake up in the morning, place your hand over your heart and feel love. * Buy a journal.

The day was September 6, 1522, and the port aheadwas Sanlúcar de Barrameda, Spain. The ship was the Victory, commanded by CaptainJuan Sebastián de Elcano.The Victory was the last survivor of five ships commanded by Portuguese marinerFerdinand Magellan. With a well-equipped fleet, he set out from Spain onSeptember 20, 1519, with the goal of circumnavigating the globe via the SpiceIslands.Magellan first sailed south to Africa. From there, he crossed the Atlantic toBrazil. He followed the Brazilian coast, searching for a strait that would leadto the Pacific Ocean. Traversing the entire length of South America, he spentthe winter in the sheltered bay at Puerto San Julián, Argentina, near thesouthern end of the continent.On Easter day, his captains mutinied, but Magellan was able to subdue therebellion. He executed one mutineer and beached one of the others.On October 21, he finally found the passage he’d been looking for, now calledthe Strait of Magellan. By that time, one ship had been wrecked and a second onehad deserted the convoy.It took the remaining three ships 38 days to round the treacherous promontory ofTierra del Fuego. When Magellan saw the Pacific at the other end of the strait,he wept for joy. Ninety-nine days later, after sailing across the tranquilocean, he landed at the island of Guam on March 6, 1521. His men were starving.They had chewed the leather straps of their tunics to stay alive.The survivors resupplied in the Philippine islands. In two ships, laden withspices, they began the journey home. One ship was lost at sea, and only theVictory straggled back to Spain. Only 22 of the original 270 men survived.image [images/p60.jpg]Ferdinand Magellan.Magellan was not one of the survivors. He had died en route. On April 27, whilefighting as an ally of the chief of the Philippine island of Cebu against atribe on the neighboring island of Mactan, Magellan was struck by a poisonedarrow. His retreating comrades left him to die.Magellan’s voyage was made possible by a remarkable electromagnetic invention,the compass. Invented in China, the first reference to it appeared in amanuscript written in 1040 (Vardalas, 2013). It describes an “iron fish” thatwhen suspended in water, always pointed south.A Song dynasty scholar named Shen Kuo wrote another account in 1088. He saidthat when “magicians rub the point of a needle with lodestone, then it is ableto point to the south. . . . It may be made to float on the surface of water,but it is then rather unsteady. . . . It is best to suspend it by a singlecocoon fiber of new silk attached to the center of the needle by a piece of wax.Then, hanging in a windless place, it will always point to the south.” Indeed,this must have looked like magic in the 11th century, when electromagneticfields were unknown.image [images/p61.jpg]Nineteenth-century Chinese compass.About 200 years before Magellan’s voyage, the first European compass was used inAmalfi, Italy. Mariners of seafaring nations such as England, France, Holland,Spain, and Portugal recognized the importance of this technological marvel anddeveloped and refined the design.Without the compass, Magellan’s remarkable feat of navigation would have beenimpossible. A thin sliver of magnetized metal suspended in the center, it pointsto Earth’s magnetic north pole regardless of where on the globe it is located.Lines of magnetic force surround Earth’s mantle and are detected by thecompass’s needle.image [images/p61-1.jpg]Earth’s magnetic field.Celestial bodies such as stars and planets have electromagnetic fields. Smallobjects such as crystals and rocks have them too. So do living beings. You havea field around your body, and it extends about five yards or meters out.FIELDS ARE BEAUTIFUL—AND EVERYWHEREElectromagnetic fields are now being measured around increasing numbers ofplants and animals. In a study published in the prestigious journal Science, aresearch team investigated the electromagnetic relationship between flowers andthe bees that pollinate them.They found that bees can detect the fields around flowers and use theinformation to determine which flowers have the most nectar (Clarke, Whitney,Sutton, & Robert, 2013). Study co-author Daniel Robert, a biologist at theUniversity of Bristol, says, “We think bumblebees are using this ability toperceive electrical fields to determine if flowers were recently visited byother bumblebees and are therefore worth visiting.”The electromagnetic properties of the fields around living beings came as asurprise to scientists immersed in matter-bound explanations. Thomas Seeley, abehavioral biologist at Cornell University, commented after reading the study,“We had no idea that this sense even existed.”image [images/p62.jpg]A flower’s electromagnetic field.The ability to perceive electromagnetic fields has now been measured in algae,worms, ants, insects, anteaters, platypuses, and hummingbirds.Research has recently shown that dolphins are also able to detectelectromagnetic fields. The Guiana dolphin is a species that lives close toestuaries in protected waters off the coast of South America. German researcherstested these river dolphins and found that they were sensitive to even very weakelectrical currents (Czech-Damal et al., 2011).The researchers then investigated how the dolphins were able to detect thesefields, and they found small hair follicles around the dolphins’ mouths. Theindentations are surrounded by nerve endings, well supplied with blood vessels,and are filled with gel. Scientists believe these are the sensory organs bymeans of which the dolphins detect fields.FIELDS CREATE THE SHAPES OF MOLECULESI vividly remember my first experience with electromagnetism. In my first-gradescience class, we sprinkled iron filings onto a piece of paper. As we movedmagnets around under the paper, they rearranged the iron filings. Withouttouching, even at a distance, fields were able to rearrange matter. Because thissimple experiment is repeated millions of times each year around the world, it’seasy to forget how amazing it is. We take it for granted that fields exist andare able to shape matter, yet we somehow forget to apply this concept when we’restruggling with the challenges of everyday material life. Whether we scale uplarge—to the size of a planet or a galaxy—or scale down small—to the size of asingle atom—we find fields. Each cell of your body has its own uniqueelectromagnetic field. The molecules of which your cells are built also havefields. Electromagnetism is central to the processes of biology.Aside from water, most of the molecules in our bodies are proteins. Our bodiesmanufacture more than 100,000 different types of proteins. They’re large andcomplicated molecules, with strings of atoms folded around each other to makeintricate designs. When a cell is synthesizing a protein, it creates these foldsthe same way my first-grade science class moved iron filings.image [images/p64.jpg]Protein molecules are intricately folded.image [images/p64-1.jpg]Protein before and after folding. Electrical charges at different points on themolecule determine how it shapes itself.Each part of the string of molecules making up a protein has its own positive ornegative charge. If two parts of the string are both negatively charged, theyrepel each other. The same is true of positively charged parts. On the otherhand, negatives and positives are attracted to each other. These forces ofattraction and repulsion mold the big and complicated protein string into itsdesignated shape.STALKING THE WILD FIELDWillem Einthoven was an eccentric Dutch physician born in 1860. In the late1890s, he set out to measure the electromagnetic field of the human heart. Hebegan building a device called a galvanometer. Einthoven faced a great deal ofskepticism and opposition, and to many of his medical colleagues, who were usedto looking only at matter, the notion of invisible energy fields seemed suspect.His first attempts were unpromising. His machine weighed 600 pounds (270 kg) andneeded five people to operate it. A water-filled radiator system was required tocool the powerful electromagnets on which it relied.image [images/p65.jpg]An early electrocardiogram device.After years of painstaking work, Einthoven developed a galvanometer much moresensitive than any available at the time. He was able to hook up subjects andmeasure their heart rates. He eventually built up a substantial theory of howthe heart functioned and what the readings of electrocardiograms (EKGs) meantfor diagnosis and treatment.As for his critics? Einthoven had the last laugh, winning the Nobel Prize formedicine in 1924. He inspired the search for the field of the brain, which wasdiscovered in 1926. Later researchers were able to map the field of even asingle cell.image [images/p66.jpg]An early EEG recording, showing the electromagnetic activity of the brain.WHAT ARE FIELDS DOING?Harold Saxton Burr was a visionary researcher who became a professor at YaleSchool of Medicine in 1929. He began to study the energy fields around animalsand plants, measuring ways in which matter (atoms, molecules, and cells) isorganized by those fields as organisms develop and grow. In a key paper in 1949,he mapped the electromagnetic field around a single nerve. His carefulmeasurements showed a field much like the iron filings around the magnet in myfirst-grade science class. The field was strongest closest to the nerve andbecame weaker moving outward from the nerve (Burr & Mauro, 1949).Burr’s huge insight was that fields weren’t just produced by living organisms,but that fields created matter, providing lines of force around which mattercould arrange itself into atoms, molecules, and cells.image [images/p66-1.jpg]Harold Saxton Burr.In his book The Fields of Life (1973), Burr used the analogy of the iron filingswith which I played as a child. If you shake the iron filings off the paper andadd new ones, they arrange themselves into the same patterns as the discardedones. It is the field that is organizing the filings; the field is not beingproduced by the filings.Burr wrote: “Something like this . . . happens in the human body. Its moleculesand cells are constantly being torn apart and rebuilt with fresh material fromthe food we eat. But, thanks to the controlling [life]-field, the new moleculesand cells are rebuilt as before and arrange themselves in the same pattern asthe old ones” (Burr, 1973, pp. 12–13).For instance, when you cut your finger and your skin regrows, the field providesthe blueprint around which the new cells organize themselves. Energy is not anepiphenomenon of matter; energy is organizing matter.For many of his experiments, Burr used salamanders. He measured the voltages onthe outer membranes of salamander eggs, and found that one spot had maximumvoltage, while a spot 180 degrees opposite had minimal voltage. He marked bothspots.When the salamanders grew to maturity, he found that what had been the pointwith the strongest field in the egg had become the head. The point with lowestelectrical activity was always the tail. The field appeared to be organizing thematter of the egg during gestation and development.Burr used mice to determine if the energy field played a role in cancer. Hemeasured their fields and noted which mice later developed cancer. After takingmore than 10,000 measurements, he found that the electromagnetic signature ofcancer appeared in the mouse’s energy field before any detectable cellularmalignancy was evident.image [images/p67.jpg]Thermography scan of a couple doing yoga.ENERGY CREATES MATTERIn a landmark study published in 1947, Burr turned his attention to humandisease to determine if his observations might have therapeutic value. He andhis colleagues examined women with uterine cancer. They found that these women’suteruses had an electromagnetic charge that was different from the charge ofhealthy uteruses (Langman & Burr, 1947).Burr then looked at a group of healthy women who did not have a diagnosis ofuterine cancer. Those women who had the electromagnetic signature of uterinecancer—even though they were apparently healthy—were the ones who went on todevelop cancer later. Cancer was showing up in the field of energy before itshowed up in the cells of matter. Burr’s work demonstrated that it is not thecase that material organs and organisms like hearts and uteruses and salamandersand mice create energy fields. Energy fields form the templates around whichmatter condenses. Change the field and you change matter.Though this understanding may be relatively recent in modern science, it isactually not an entirely new concept. An ancient saying in traditional Chinesemedicine is “The mind controls the qi, and the blood follows the qi.” By qi(also spelled chi) the ancient sages were referring to life energy, and by bloodthey meant the matter of the body. Energy directs matter.WHAT IS H2O?Water is so familiar to us that many of us take it for granted. It makes up 70percent of the volume of our bodies and comprises a similar percentage of thesurface of the planet. We drink it and bathe in it every day without giving it asecond thought. While people other than chemists can’t recite the formula forany other molecule, everyone knows that the formula for water is H2O. Yet itturns out that this most common of substances holds profound lessons about therelationship of energy to matter.If I ask you, “What is H2O?” you’re likely to answer, “Water, of course.”Certainly, if I hand you a glass of H2O at room temperature, it’s water. But ifI add energy to the water by placing it on the stove, it becomes steam. It’sstill H2O, but the increase in energy has completely changed the material formit takes.If I take the same H2O and place it in the freezer, subtracting energy, thematter changes form again. It becomes ice. The decrease in energy has againcompletely altered the form of the matter. This is one analogy that my colleagueEric Leskowitz, M.D., of Harvard Medical School, an expert on energy inacupuncture, uses to explain the effect of energy on matter. In similar ways,energy underlies the form matter takes in a huge number of ways that we don’tusually notice.image [images/p69.jpg]H2O can exist in several different states yet still be water.WATER AND HEALINGIn a remarkable series of experiments at McGill University, pioneeringresearcher Bernard Grad examined the effect of healing energy on animals andplants.The healing was provided by a former Hungarian cavalry officer named OskarEstebany, who could heal people by projecting energy from his hands. He was nottrained in any way, and he had discovered his gift by accident when massaginghorses. He believed that this energy was electromagnetic in nature and that itwas a natural human ability. Grad first tested Estebany’s abilities on mice.Four rows of small puncture wounds were made on their backs, and Estebany wasinstructed to “heal” only the two center rows. Sure enough, these rows healedfaster than the outer rows. Estebany’s mice also healed significantly fasterthan those held by students.Grad then tested the effect of treated water on the growth rate of barley seeds.When provided with water held by Estebany for 30 minutes, more of the seedsgerminated and the resulting plants grew taller. Their chlorophyll contentincreased, and the quality of leaf growth was significantly enhanced (Grad,1963). Other researchers also found highly significant improvements in plantgrowth or seed germination after healers treated the plants (Scofield & Hodges,1991; Kronn, 2006).One rigorous study examined water treated by therapeutic touch practitioners(Schwartz, De Mattei, Brame, & Spottiswoode, 2015). The molecule H2O has twohydrogen atoms bonded to a single oxygen atom. The angle of the bond betweenthem can be measured, just as you can open a hinge partially and measure theangle it forms. The angle of the molecular bond of normal water is 104.5degrees.After 45-minute therapeutic touch sessions, the water showed highlystatistically significant changes in its absorption of infrared light, whichdemonstrated that the bonding angle between the oxygen and two hydrogen atomswas altered by contact with the healing field. This particular experiment wasvery carefully blinded and controlled. Other researchers have also foundalterations in the molecular structure of water after contact with a healer (Lu,1997; Kronn, 2006).Penn State University materials science professor Rustum Roy conducted manystudies of the structure of water. He found that water molecules have a varietyof potential configurations in which they can bond together. These can bealtered by passing specific frequencies through the water. Water resonates withthese frequencies, and the resulting water can have healing properties (Rao,Sedlmayr, Roy, & Kanzius, 2010).Chinese qigong master Xin Yan has demonstrated the ability to alter themolecular structure of water dramatically, even at a distance. Researchers fromthe Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted 10 experiments with Dr. Yan. In thefirst, he stood near the water. In the other nine, he was at a distance ofbetween 7 km and 1,900 km. In all cases, he was able to affect the water whileallowing a control sample to remain unchanged.When performing studies showing that energy healing cured cancer in mice, BillBengston noted similar changes in the infrared properties of water held by thehealer (Bengston, 2010). He also reviewed research showing that the energyfields of a healer’s hands can change how fast cellular enzymes catalyze and, inred blood corpuscles, increase the content of hemoglobin, the compound thatcarries oxygen to our cells.image [images/p71.jpg]H2O is an oxygen atom bonded to two hydrogen atoms at an angle of 104.5 degrees.ADELINE AND THE HEALING STARSIn the early 1980s, I interviewed a cancer survivor named Adeline. I was workingon a project recording spontaneous remissions. Among the many stories I heard,hers stands out to me.By the time Adeline was diagnosed with uterine cancer in her early 30s, it hadspread throughout her body. Adeline’s doctors recommended surgery followed bychemotherapy and radiation. Her chances of survival were small.Unwilling to surrender her body to the ravages of treatment, she decided thatinstead, she would make her last months as serene as possible.Adeline began to take long walks in the redwoods of Northern California whereshe lived. She also took long baths each day, letting water out as it cooled andtopping the bath off with hot water. As she lay in the tub and walked throughthe forest, she imagined tiny glittering healing stars raining from heaven. Theypassed through her body, and whenever the point of a star touched a cancer cell,she imagined the cancer cell popping like a burst balloon.Adeline ate the healthiest diet possible, meditated every day, readinspirational books, and terminated her relationships with people whose companywas upsetting to her. Aside from a couple of close friends, most of her time wasspent in solitude.Her walks became longer, and she found herself feeling better physically thanshe’d felt her entire life.When she went back to the hospital for a checkup nine months later, Adeline’sdoctors could find no trace of cancer in her body.Adeline changed her energy in every possible way. She changed the energy of herphysical environment by immersing herself in nature. She filled her mind withpositive and specific images like the healing stars and with the upliftingenergy of inspirational books. She ate food with an elevated energeticsignature. She eliminated the negative energy of unhappy friends. She batheddaily, a practice that fills the body with electrons, countering the freeradicals that are a major source of oxidative stress and cell degeneration.In this pervasive environment of positive healing energy, directed byconsciousness, the matter of Adeline’s body began to change. Her cellsresponded, and her body began to eliminate the malfunctioning cancerous tissue.She used energy to heal her material body, and she never went back to her oldhabits.Adeline became so accustomed to feeling good that it became her new normal. WhenI interviewed her seven years later, she was still meditating, eating clean, andliving a low-stress lifestyle—and she was still cancer-free.Adeline’s story shows that it’s not just gifted healers like Oskar Estebany whoheal with energy. We can heal ourselves as well when we adjust our consciousnessto the frequency of healing. The matter of our cells responds to the energy ofour consciousness.We’re all familiar with the parlor trick of an opera singer breaking a wineglass. When the frequency of the singer’s voice raises the energy of themolecules in the glass to the critical limit, they shatter. This is a well-knownillustration of a little-known field of study called cymatics, the science ofhow sound affects matter. Dive deeper into cymatics, and we find that sound isas full of astonishing properties as water.image [images/p72.jpg]The resonant frequency of sound vibration can shatter a wine glass.CYMATICS: HOW FREQUENCY CHANGES MATTERErnst Chladni was a 19th-century German physicist and musician. He is called thefather of acoustics for his pioneering experiments with sound. His father was astrict disciplinarian who did not allow young Ernst outside to play each dayuntil he had finished his rigorous studies.Chladni had an extremely sensitive musical ear, able to discern very smalldifferences between frequencies. After obtaining two degrees, one in law and onein philosophy, Chladni became interested in the study of sound. Inspired byother scientists who had made energy fields visible, he developed a new device.Fine sand was placed on top of a thin metal plate and a violin bow was drawnalong the side of the plate. This caused the plate to vibrate. Differentvibrational frequencies produced different patterns in the sand.image [images/p73.jpg]Chladni plate.Chladni became famous for his public demonstrations, and he traveled throughoutEurope year after year. This brought him into contact with many otherscientists, and he progressively developed his ideas. He published his seminalwork, Acoustics, in 1802, founding a new scientific field.image [images/p74.jpg]The frequency of sound passed through a Chladni plate produces differentpatterns. Above, 1305 Hz and 5065 Hz. Below, 2076 Hz and 2277 Hz.image [images/p74-1.jpg]The study of how sound affects matter is called cymatics. Following Chladni’spioneering work, scientists have been examining the effects of vibrational toneson various substances. Vibrations can change the configuration of materialobjects dramatically and immediately.A modern Chladni plate is attached to a scientific instrument called a vibrationgenerator. When the frequency is adjusted, the metal vibrates at differentrates. When a substance with a contrasting color, such as white sand, issprinkled on the plate, patterns are visible. That’s because when certainfrequencies are passed through molecules, they produce distinct shapes.Generally, the higher the frequency, the more complex the pattern it produces inmatter.Various types of matter can be used to illustrate the effect of energy passingthrough Chladni plates. Salt and sand are popular media. Living organisms suchas seeds also respond.image [images/p75.jpg]A large Chladni plate at the Harvard University natural sciences laboratory.Chladni plates and vibration generators are popular items in high-school scienceclasses. They can be purchased online or easily made at home using simplematerials. Yet as a demonstration of how energy organizes matter, they are apowerful reminder that every frequency that passes through our bodies and mindsis organizing the molecules of our bodies.SOUND VIBRATIONS CREATE SQUARE WATERWater can also be made to change shape in response to vibration. When watercomes out of a tube, the shape of the stream is round. If certain frequenciesare played nearby, however, it changes its regular form into a series of rightangles or a spiral.image [images/p76.jpg]A stream of water changes shape in response to sound vibration from a speaker.Another way to visualize the impact of energy frequencies on matter is to passsound waves through a dish of water. As the frequency is changed, the patternsin the water change too. Certain types of classical music produce complex andbeautiful patterns in the water, while other frequencies, such as those found inharsh music, produce chaotic and disorganized wave forms.image [images/p76-1.jpg]Water in a backlit glass dish changing shape as various energy frequencies arepassed through it.YOUR PERSONALITY IN A DROP OF WATERA fascinating series of experiments at the Aerospace Institute (officially, theInstitute for Static and Dynamics for Aerospace Constructions) in Stuttgart,Germany, used water as a medium. The studies, performed by Professor Dr. BerndHelmut Kröplin, measured the effect of different people on water.A large group of students participated in one experiment. Each one filled ahypodermic syringe with water and squeezed a series of droplets onto amicroscope slide. Kröplin’s team then took photographs of the droplets.They found that each person’s group of droplets looked quite different from thedroplets produced by the others. The droplets produced by the same person,however, were virtually the same. Even if the person squeezed out 20 droplets, asimilar pattern was discernable in all 20. But that group of droplets lookeddifferent from the droplets produced by the next person, and the next. It seemedthat passage through the energy field of a person produced an indelible andconsistent impact on the matter, in the form of water, that they handled.image [images/p77.jpg]A subject produces a series of droplets on a microscope slide.image [images/p78.jpg]However many droplets are produced by a person, they all look similar. Yet theyare completely different from a series of droplets produced by another person.Just as the fingerprints of every one of the eight billion people on the planetare unique, the energy field of each person is unique. When water passes througha person’s energy field, the shapes it assumes are always the same, whiledifferent from the shapes produced by any other person. Kröplin and hisassociate Regine Henschel describe their latest research in their book Water andIts Memory, saying, “To our surprise, we could demonstrate that the drop imageis changed in the vicinity of the experimenter by the individual energy fieldaround him or her. Each experimenter creates an individual, reproducible set ofdrop images without any special mind or thought activity” (Kröplin & Henschel,2017).Another study, this time on the effects of distant intention on water, wasperformed by a research group at the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) inPetaluma, California.A group of 2,000 people in Tokyo focused positive intentions on water samplesinside an electromagnetically shielded room in Petaluma. Such rooms, also knownas Faraday cages, are lead-lined chambers designed to screen out all known formsof radiation. Fiber-optic cables connect the instrumentation inside the room tothe lab outside, so that even conventional electromagnetic fields are screenedout.Unknown to the group of earnest intenders in Tokyo, however, similar watersamples were being held in a different location as controls.Photographs of ice crystals formed from both sets of water were then viewed by100 independent judges. They found the shapes in the treated water morebeautiful than those in the untreated water (Radin, Hayssen, Emoto, & Kizu,2006).image [images/p79.jpg]Water exposed to the music of Mozart.image [images/p79-1.jpg]Water exposed to the music of Vivaldi.image [images/p79-2.jpg]Water exposed to heavy metal music.Your body is 70 percent water. That water is responding to the vibrations aroundit as certainly as the particles on the Chladni plates or the droplets on Dr.Kröplin’s microscope slides. When you are flooding the water molecules of yourbody with the vibrations of healing energy, you are entraining them in sympathywith wellness, while discordant vibrations have the opposite effect. Immerseyour mind in positive energy and at least 70 percent of the matter in your bodycomes into sync with that elevated state.HOW SOUND CURED JIM’S ALCOHOLISM AND CARDIAC DISEASEBy Frances Dachelet, R.N., licensed acupuncturist, acutonics practitionerJim, a 40-year-old married man, sought treatment for intermittent heartpalpitations that had been active over the previous month. He reported that whenhis heart started to race, he felt anxiety, shortness of breath, and chest pain.He was admitted to the hospital the first time it happened and had a completeheart workup that was negative for myocardial infarction or any specific heartproblem. Jim had been married for one year and was the father of a six-month-oldbaby boy. He worked full-time as a physician’s assistant in an emergency caresetting and found his work busy and rewarding.Jim had a long family history of alcoholism. His father had been physicallyabusive to him, his siblings, and his mother. Jim had received some therapy inthe past to deal with particular childhood problems.Jim admitted that he hides and covers many of his feelings with humor andsarcasm. He worries about being a good enough father, husband, and physician’sassistant. When he doubts himself, he uses alcohol to calm his worries. Headmitted to having a problem with drinking, although he had reduced the numberof times he drank to excess.Jim eats a vegetarian diet and has hot meals with his family that his wifeprepares. He reported consuming too much dairy and cheese and had gained weightsince getting married. He acknowledged the need to drink more water, that hewill go for long periods of time not drinking liquids at all during a day, thenhaving a beer or cocktails at night.He was assessed energetically with: * Shen disturbance (agitation of the spirit) * Imbalances of the liver, spleen, and kidney meridian energies * Intergenerational alcoholism * Heart chakra issues * FearAt the first treatment, Jim came in with heart palpitations and was visiblyuncomfortable and frightened. Treatment strategies for this visit were to calmthe spirit, slow the heart rate and breathing, and strengthen the kidney energyto anchor the energy of the heart and lung acupuncture meridians.The treatment was started with tuning forks for grounding, centering, andstabilizing kidney meridian energy. Tuning fork intervals were applied to pointsfor calming the spirit and nourishing and balancing the heart energy.Grounding on kidney points was repeated, and Jim reported feeling calm and asensation he described as his heart slowing down. He was less anxious andvisibly relaxed on the treatment table.Extraordinary vessels were used to address the intergenerational issues, drawingon their primordial connection to Source to open to those deep-seated childhoodissues. Tuning fork combinations were used to break through the familial issues.The session ended with additional grounding, using kidney points located on thefeet. Jim reported feeling calm and rested.Dietary, hydration, and exercise recommendations were made to Jim. He reportedno palpitations or panic symptoms following his first treatment.Subsequent treatments focused on nourishing kidney energy and balancing thenervous system while continuing to address familial patterns and to providenurturance.High-octave tuning forks were added and sounded above the body to clear and healthe body’s subtle energy field.The treatment series ended by grounding the energy shifts, using kidney pointson the feet.Jim reported that after his first treatment, the palpitations did not return.Though he still experienced occasional stress and anxiety, he felt much better.He continued to work on his diet and stopped drinking alcohol. He wasinvestigating an outpatient rehabilitation program and considering treatment.ENERGY FLOWS ALONG ACUPUNCTURE MERIDIANSAcupuncture meridians such as the kidney, liver, and spleen meridians used inJim’s treatment sequence have been used for healing for thousands of years. Themeridians and the acupoints along them were identified in a Chinese book calledThe Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine that is more than 2,000 yearsold.Meridians were also known in Europe. A mummified body found in the Alps in 1991exhibits 61 tattoos. Some are shaped like crosses or targets. Scientists havestudied the mummy, called Otzi, extensively and can identify the diseases fromwhich he suffered. Some of the tattoos are directly on the acupoints for thoseparticular conditions. Otzi’s corpse is some 5,400 years old, making it apparentthat human beings have known for millennia about the link between these pointsand healing.image [images/p82.jpg]Some of the tattoos on Otzi’s body are on acupoints.FINDING ACUPOINTS ON YOUR BODYNowadays it is easy to find acupoints on a body using a handheld skingalvanometer. Acupoints are excellent conductors of electricity, since they haveonly 1/2000th of the resistance of the surrounding skin. Low resistance equalshigh conductance, as with wires that run through a power cord. When theselow-resistance points are stimulated, energy flows through them easily.When I teach live workshops, I often use a galvanometer to find acupoints on avolunteer’s body. This makes it apparent to participants that acupoints aren’tjust some ancient Chinese fiction. They’re real and they’re measurable, and whenenergy therapies use them for healing effect, the flow of energy in the body isaltered.image [images/p83.jpg]Acupoints can easily be identified using a handheld galvanometer.image [images/p83-1.jpg]Acupoints and meridians of the upper body.An energy psychology method that uses acupoints is called Emotional FreedomTechniques (EFT). This is the most popular of the more than 30 different energypsychology methods that exist today. EFT is used by over 20 million peopleworldwide. It stimulates acupoints on the body’s meridians by tapping on themwith the fingertips. For this reason, EFT is often simply called tapping. Itspopularity has grown rapidly over the last two decades because it’s easilylearned, quickly applied, and effective. I wrote the most recent edition of thehandbook describing the method, The EFT Manual, to make the version of EFT usedin studies more widely available (Church, 2013).That evidence-based form is called clinical EFT, and there are now over 100clinical trials published in peer-reviewed psychology and medical journalsattesting to its efficacy. Meta-analyses of EFT for depression, anxiety, andPTSD show that its treatment effects are much greater than those of drugs ortalk therapy.EFT uses some simple elements drawn from talk therapy but adds the ingredient oftapping on acupoints. It takes less than a minute to tap through them all, andpsychological distress usually diminishes immediately.I’ve presented EFT workshops at many medical and psychology conferences andnoticed that doctors usually take readily to EFT. They are very aware of thecontribution that stress makes to physical disease. I’ve had several doctorstell me that after tapping, patient issues resolved without further need forconventional allopathic treatment. As Chuck Gebhardt, M.D., observed in thefollowing account after seeing swelling subside immediately after acupointtapping, “Nothing in my traditional medical training in anatomy, physiology, orpathology even hinted at what I am now witnessing.”A FLU SHOT GONE WRONGBy Chuck Gebhardt, M.D.I am a traditionally trained American physician who has been using a somewhatmodified version of EFT for about six months. As readers would expect, I havebeen seeing great success and tremendous value to my patients. I specialize ininternal medicine and I am one of six physicians in a private practice insouthwest Georgia.I typically treat my patients as I always have, but if they are experiencingacute discomfort during our visit, I will try to treat the discomfort withtapping or pressure on acupoints (if circumstances allow). Before I introducethis technique, though, I examine, diagnose, and treat all important problems asI usually do, including their acute problems that I am about to target with anew and unusual intervention after the traditional work is done. Now for thestory.Bill received a flu shot from my very able assistant with no initial problem. Heis a 60-year-old gentleman whom I treat for hypertension andhypercholesterolemia. He is otherwise completely healthy, well balanced, anddown to earth, with no psychological problems of any kind.Early the next morning, he called and reported that within hours of the shot hisleft arm began to throb with pain and swell. . . . In my office, the area ofswelling was the size of about a half of a hardboiled egg (very dramaticindeed). It throbbed and hurt him so much, he couldn’t stand for his shirtsleeve to touch it. It was intensely red and very warm to touch. His temperaturewas 100.5°F, and he had beads of cold sweat on his forehead (calleddiaphoresis).I prescribed an antihistamine, pain medicine, and a steroid dose pack to bestarted immediately and instructed him to call us right away if he had anytrouble breathing or felt like he might pass out.As he was about to leave with his prescriptions in hand, I decided to tap onsome of the meridians on his head, left shoulder, and left arm to see if I couldrelieve his discomfort somewhat until the medications would take effect.Tapping on several spots seemed to help a little, but when I tapped on theinside of his left elbow at a spot that acupuncturists call L5, he said: “Wow!That is helping a lot.” Over the next 30 seconds, while I continuously tapped onL5, the inflamed, swollen lump shrunk to about one-tenth its initial size, theredness faded, and it stopped hurting.His low-grade temperature and diaphoresis resolved, and his feeling of malaisewas also gone. This response was jaw-dropping amazing for both me and him. Heeven pounded on the previously exquisitely tender spot with his fist to show howwell it now felt. His grin was ear to ear. When I saw him again about a monthlater, he said the pain and swelling never came back, so he didn’t see any needto fill the prescriptions I had written for him.This was one of the most dramatic responses to acupoint stimulation I havewitnessed, but it is only one of many I see on a daily basis in my practice.Nothing in my traditional medical training in anatomy, physiology, or pathologyeven hinted at what I am now witnessing. As you know, anyone who watches thesedramatic improvements knows immediately that our previous understanding of howour bodies and our minds work is in need of important revisions and redirectedresearch. This is very exciting.Dr. Gebhardt is one of many physicians using EFT for physical ailments. At oneconference, a doctor came up to me, grasped my hands, and expressed hisgratitude for the training in EFT I had given at that same conference two yearsearlier. He told me that at his clinic they now use EFT with every new patientduring the intake process. This typically clears the emotional aspects of thepresenting problem, and after that the doctors can address what’s left—the partsof the problem that are truly medical.ENERGY HEALING FOR CHAMPION SWIMMER TIM GARTON AFTER STAGE 2 NON-HODGKIN’SLYMPHOMATim Garton, a world-champion swimmer, was diagnosed in 1989 with stage 2non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. He was 49 years old and had a tumor the size of afootball in his abdomen. It was treated with surgery followed by fourchemotherapy treatments over 12 weeks, with subsequent abdominal radiation for 8weeks. Despite initial concern that the cancer appeared to be terminal, thetreatment was successful, and by 1990 Tim was told that he was in remission. Hewas also told that he would never again compete at a national or internationallevel. In 1992, however, Tim Garton returned to competitive swimming and won the100-meter freestyle world championship.In early July of 1999, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. A prostatectomy inlate July revealed that the cancer had expanded beyond the borders of hisprostate and could not all be surgically removed. Once again, he received weeklyradiation treatment in the area of his abdomen. After eight weeks of treatment,the cancer had cleared.In 2001, the lymphoma returned, this time in his neck. It was removedsurgically. Tim again received radiation, which left severe burns on his neck.The following year, a growth on the other side of his neck, moving over histrachea, was diagnosed as a fast-growing lymphoma that required emergencysurgery.He was told that the lymphoma was widespread. An autologous bone marrow and stemcell transplant was done at this time, but it was not successful. There wasconcern that the tumors would metastasize to his stomach. His doctors determinedat this point that they could do nothing more for him. He was told that highlyexperimental medical treatments, for which there was little optimism, were theonly alternative. He was given an injection of monoclonal antibodies (Rituxan),which had been minimally approved for recurrent low-grade lymphoma. Rituxan isdesigned to flag the cancer sites and potentially help stimulate the immunesystem to know where to focus.At this point, Tim enlisted the services of Kim Wedman, an energy medicinepractitioner trained by Donna Eden. Tim and his wife went to the Bahamas forthree weeks and took Kim with them for the first week. Kim provided dailysessions lasting an hour and a half. These sessions included a basic energybalancing routine, meridian tracing, a chakra clearing, and work with theelectrical, neurolymphatic, and neurovascular points.Kim also taught Tim and his wife a 20-minute twice-daily energy medicineprotocol, which they followed diligently, both during the week Kim was there andfor the subsequent two weeks. The protocol included a basic energy balancingroutine and specific interventions for the energy pathways that govern theimmune system and that feed energy to the stomach, kidneys, and bladder.Upon returning to his home in Denver, in order to determine how quickly thecancers might be spreading, Tim scheduled a follow-up assessment with theoncologist who had told him, “There is nothing more that we can do for you.” Toeveryone’s thrill and surprise, Tim was cancer-free. He has remained so duringthe four years between that assessment and the time of this writing. He has beenchecked with a PET scan each year, with no cancer detected.CREATING MATTER FROM INFINITE MINDThe big picture in all this research is that energy builds matter. We know thatwe are immersed in energy fields, from Earth’s magnetic field to the fieldsproduced by the hearts of the people closest to us. We know that our organs havefields and our cells have fields. These fields change in response to intentionand the activity of a healer—and that healer can be us.We know that disease shows up in a person’s energy field before it becomesevident at the level of matter and that the water that makes up our bodies issensitive to the energy fields around it. We know that sound frequencies changematter and that even the act of observing subatomic particles can change theirbehavior.Finally, we see that when energy is applied with the intention of healing,matter often follows. Ancient healing systems such as acupuncture, as well asmodern variants such as EFT, all show the effect of energy on our cells. Over athousand studies of energy healing show that it is effective for bothpsychological conditions (e.g., anxiety and depression) and physical symptoms,including pain and autoimmune diseases.Although science used to regard energy fields as epiphenomena of matter, theevidence now suggests that matter is an epiphenomenon of energy. The implicationfor healing is that when we change our energy fields, the cells of our materialbodies respond.Albert Einstein understood the relationship of energy to matter. His famousequation is E = mc2. The E stands for “energy” and the m stands for “matter.”They are in balance on opposite sides of the equation. He wrote, “What we havecalled matter is energy, whose vibration has been so lowered as to beperceptible to the senses. There is no matter.”We can choose to remain materialists. Faced with imbalances in our lives,disturbances in our emotions, and diseases in our bodies, we can look formaterial solutions like pills or surgery or recreational drugs to make us feelbetter.We can also choose the path of energy. When people change energetically, matterfollows right along. Faced with the inevitable challenges of being human, we cantake Einstein’s advice and shift the E side of the equation. Simple, broadlyeffective, and elegant, working at the level of energy frees us from the tyrannyof matter. We address our problems at the level of cause rather than effect.As we free our attention from fascination with matter, we perceive theintelligence innate in energy. Shifting to the level of detached consciousnessopens us to the infinite possibilities contained in the nonlocal field ofinfinite intelligence.When we create in alignment with this universal nonlocal field, we are in touchwith the field of infinite possibilities. We are no longer bound by the limitedsubset of possibilities offered by matter. This interaction patterns the cellsof our bodies, from water molecules to neurons, and aligns our material formwith the endless possibilities in the field of infinite intelligence.Habituating ourselves to living there, we create entirely different lives thanare possible when we remain bound by the limitations of material thinking.PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEActivities to practice this week: * Sing for at least a few minutes each day when you’re alone. * Experience water deeply.

He was taking part in military exercises in the town of Würzburg,and his unit was pulling artillery pieces into position with their horses.Suddenly, Berger’s horse reared up on its hind legs, throwing him to the groundright in front of one of the wagon wheels. At the last second, Berger’sdesperate companions halted the momentum of the gun just before it crushed him.Berger escaped death with nothing more than a dirty uniform.That evening, he received a telegram from his father in Coburg, asking about hiswell-being. His father had never sent him a telegram before. That morning,Berger’s older sister had been “overwhelmed by an ominous feeling . . .convinced that something terrible had happened to him” and urged her father tosend the telegram.Berger struggled to understand how his feelings of terror might have beencommunicated to his sister over 100 kilometers away. He had been planning tobecome an astronomer but now changed his mind, and after his discharge from thearmy, he became a psychiatrist instead, studying the workings of the brain(Millett, 2001).In June of 1924, he had the opportunity to study the brain of a 17-year-old boywho had a gap in his skull as a result of an earlier surgery to remove a braintumor. He wanted to see if he could measure brain activity. After weeks ofmodifications to his equipment in the wake of unsuccessful readings, to Berger’sexcitement, he finally observed “continuous oscillations of the galvanometer.”He wrote in his journal: “Is it possible that I might fulfill the plan I havecherished for over 20 years and even still, to create a kind of brain mirror:the electroencephalogram!” (Millett, 2001).image [images/p92.jpg]Hans Berger.In 1929, after refining his equipment and skills, Berger described the first twobrain waves ever discovered: alpha and beta. Unfortunately, Berger’s work rancounter to the brain theories then prevalent in contemporary medicine, and hiswork was rejected by most of his colleagues. British and American scientistsbelieved that what he was measuring was the result of an electrical artifact,and one wrote that he was “highly skeptical of the possibility of recordinganything of significance from the surface of the brain.”Berger was forced into retirement from his university professorship and hishealth worsened. He sank into depression and took his own life in 1941. It wasnot until consciousness researchers began to investigate the link between mindand brain in the 1960s that EEGs came into widespread use. They’re now used tomap states of consciousness as well as brain function, and new waves such asgamma continue to be discovered (Hughes, 1964).THE COMMUNICATING BRAIN: CLAPPING “THE WAVE”I travel to New York often, and I love going to see Broadway musicals. When TheBook of Mormon opened, I was one of the first to buy tickets. Members of theaudience were laughing all the way through. At the end, the cast got a standingovation.Suddenly, the applause changed. Rather than a thousand people clappingseparately, everyone began to clap in rhythm. Clap, clap, clap, clap. Therhythmic clapping become so insistent that the actors came back onstage for anencore. The clapping communicated approval to the actors, and they respondedwith another song.The neurons in your brain do something similar. They fire together in rhythmicpatterns, communicating with each other across the brain. These patterns aremeasured in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). Imagine an audience clappingtogether slowly. That’s a slow brain wave, with millions of neurons firingtogether slowly. Imagine an audience clapping quickly. That’s a fast brain wave,with millions of neurons firing together quickly.Today’s EEGs calculate wave patterns from each of the brain’s many differentparts. They typically use 19 electrodes attached to the surface of the scalp.image [images/p93.jpg]A typical 19-electrode array.One research team observed, “Scientists are now so accustomed to these EEGcorrelations with brain state that they may forget just how remarkable they are.. . . A single electrode provides estimates of synaptic action averaged overtissue masses containing between roughly 100 million and 1 billion neurons”(Nunez & Srinivasan, 2006). When we see brain wave changes on an EEG, itindicates that the firing patterns of billions of neurons in our brains are alsochanging.WHAT BRAIN WAVES ARE AND WHAT THEY DOThere are five basic brain waves that are picked up by a modern EEG. Gamma isthe highest brain wave frequency (40 to 100 Hz). It’s most prevalent at timeswhen the brain is learning, making associations between phenomena andintegrating information from many different parts of the brain.A brain producing lots of gamma waves reflects complex neural organization andheightened awareness. When monks were asked to meditate on compassion, largeflares of gamma were found in their brains (Davidson & Lutz, 2008).They were compared to novice meditators who had meditated for an hour a day theweek before. The novices had brain activity similar to that of the monks. Butwhen the monks were instructed to evoke a feeling of compassion, their brainsbegan to fire in rhythmic coherence, like the audience clapping at The Book ofMormon musical.The flares of gamma waves measured in the brains of the monks were the largestever recorded. The monks reported entering a state of bliss. Gamma is associatedwith very high levels of intellectual function, creativity, integration, peakstates, and of feeling “in the zone.” Gamma waves flow from the front to theback of the brain about 40 times per second (Llinás, 2014). Researchers look tothis oscillating wave as a neural correlate of consciousness (NCC), a statelinking the brain’s activity with the subjective experience of consciousness(Tononi & Koch, 2015).Brain researchers talk about the amplitude of a brain wave and that simply meanshow big it is. A high amplitude of gamma means a big gamma wave, while a lowamplitude means a small one. Measurements of brain waves show peaks and valleys.The distance from the peak to the trough is the amplitude. Amplitude is measuredin microvolts, and brain waves typically measure between 10 and 100 microvolts,with the faster waves like gamma having the lowest amplitude.image [images/p95.jpg]EEG brain waves from slowest to fastest.The next fastest wave is beta (12 to 40 Hz). Beta is typically divided into twoparts: high beta and low beta. High beta is your monkey mind. High beta (15 to40 Hz) is the signature brain wave of people with anxiety, people experiencingfrustration, and people under stress.The more stressed people become, the higher the amplitude of the beta theirbrains produce. Negative emotions such as anger, fear, blame, guilt, and shameproduce large flares of beta in the EEG readout.This shuts down the brain regions that handle rational thinking, decisionmaking, memory, and objective evaluation (LeDoux, 2002). Blood flow to theprefrontal cortex, the “thinking brain,” is reduced by up to 80 percent. Starvedof oxygen and nutrients, our brains’ ability to think clearly plummets.Low beta is the band that synchronizes our bodies’ automatic functions, so it’salso called the sensorimotor rhythm frequency, or SMR (12 to 15 Hz).Beta is required for processing information and for linear thinking, so normallevels of beta are fine. When you focus on solving a problem, composing a poem,calculating the best route to your destination, or balancing your checkbook,beta is your friend. SMR represents a calm, focused mental state. It’s stressthat produces high beta, especially above 25 Hz.Alpha (8 to 12 Hz) is an optimal state of relaxed alertness. Alpha connects thehigher frequencies—the thinking mind of beta and the associative mind ofgamma—with the two lowest frequency brain waves, which are theta (4 to 8 Hz) anddelta (0 to 4 Hz).Theta is characteristic of light sleep. When we dream vividly, our eyes moverapidly and our brains are primarily in theta. Theta is the frequency of rapideye movement (REM) sleep. Theta is also the dominant frequency of people underhypnosis, healers, people in trances, and people in highly creative states(Kershaw & Wade, 2012). The recollection of emotional experiences, both good andbad, can trigger theta.The slowest frequency is delta. Delta is characteristic of deep sleep. Very highamplitudes of delta are also found in people who are in touch with nonlocalmind, even when they’re wide awake. The brains of meditators, intuitives, andhealers have much more delta than normal.The eyes of people who are in deep dreamless sleep don’t move. Delta waves alsopredominate in such non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep.image [images/p96.jpg]On this type of chart (a “z-score” chart), the middle shade indicates normalactivity, and the two lighter shades progressively reduced activity. The twodarker shades indicate increased activity. The brain on the left shows a varietyof activity. The brain on the right is highly active at the middle frequenciesof theta, a common pattern in experienced healers.AWAKENING FROM EVERYDAY REALITYEEG pioneer Maxwell Cade noticed that alpha, in the middle of the range offrequencies, forms a bridge between the two high frequencies of beta and gammaand the two low frequencies of theta and delta (Cade & Coxhead, 1979).Biofeedback and neurofeedback skills focus on teaching people how to get into analpha state. The ideal state is enough alpha to link all of the other brainrhythms together. High beta is minimized, so that there is very little monkeymind and anxiety. There is a balanced amount of gamma and theta, and a wide baseof delta.image [images/p97.jpg]Maxwell Cade.A biophysicist, Cade had worked on radar for the British government beforeturning his attention to measuring states of consciousness. He developed his ownmachine, the “mind mirror,” in 1976. It is unique among EEG devices in that itprovides a clear visual snapshot of brain waves.His student Anna Wise described the machine as follows: “What sets the MindMirror apart from other forms of electroencephalography was the interest, on thepart of its developer, not in pathological states (as in the case of medicaldevices), but in an optimum state called the Awakened Mind. Instead of measuringsubjects with problems, the inventor of the Mind Mirror sought the most highlydeveloped and spiritually conscious people he could find. In the flicker oftheir brainwaves, he and his colleagues found a common pattern, whether thesubject was a yogi, a Zen master or a healer.”THE AWAKENED MINDUsing the mind mirror, over 20 years, Cade recorded the brain wave patterns ofmore than four thousand people with strong spiritual practices. He found theAwakened Mind state was common in this group. Cade also noticed anothersimilarity: they all had high amounts of alpha.As noted, alpha waves are right in the middle of the spectrum, with beta andgamma above, and theta and delta below. When someone in the Awakened Mind statehas lots of alpha, it creates a link between the high frequencies above and thelow frequencies below. Cade called this the alpha bridge, because it bridges theconscious mind frequencies of beta with the subconscious and unconscious mindfrequencies of theta and delta. This allows a flow of consciousness, integratingall the levels of mind.Cade wrote: “The awakening of awareness is like gradually awakening from sleepand becoming more and more vividly aware of everyday reality—only it’s everydayreality from which we are awakening!” (Cade & Coxhead, 1979).image [images/p98.jpg]Max Cade with first 1970s version of the mind mirror.I developed a meditation method called EcoMeditation that’s very simple, yetit’s consistently and automatically able to bring people into the Awakened MindEEG pattern. EcoMeditation uses EFT tapping to clear obstacles to relaxation. Itthen takes you through a series of simple physical relaxation exercises thatsend signals of safety to the brain and body. It does not rely on belief orphilosophy; instead, it’s based on sending the body physiological cues thatproduce a deeply relaxed state automatically. The instructions are free atEcoMeditation.com [http://EcoMeditation.com].During EcoMeditation, we see lots of delta brain waves as well. Delta is wherewe connect with many resources above and beyond the local self. As noted, peoplein trance states, as well as healers, artists, musicians, and intuitives, tendto have plenty of delta.Those in a creative trance, such as a composer making music or a child at play,usually have lots of delta. They lose all awareness of the outer world as theybecome absorbed in their creativity. They’re mostly in delta, with some thetaand alpha, and just enough beta to function (Gruzelier, 2009).It’s been fascinating to me to speak to people whose brains show a highamplitude of delta during meditation. They report transcendent experiences. Theydescribe feeling one with the universe, an exquisite sense of harmony andwell-being (Johnson, 2011). Albert Einstein referred to this as an expansivestate of consciousness in which we “embrace all living creatures and the wholeof nature.” Scientists can be mystics too!image [images/p99.jpg]Display from the mind mirror.

They’re also amplifying theta, though the waves are not balanced equallybetween left and right hemispheres.image [images/p101.jpg]Balance between brain activities: The “Awakened Mind” pattern, with largeamounts of delta and theta, and lowered beta. Plentiful alpha provides an “alphabridge” between conscious mind (beta) and unconscious and subconscious levels(theta and delta).THE MUSICIAN TRAPPED INSIDE THE PROGRAMMERAt a live workshop, I taught EcoMeditation to Prem, a 42-year-old man withmoderate anxiety. He was a computer programmer who wanted to bring morecreativity into his life. Prem played the guitar but rarely made time for it,even though it was his favorite hobby. “I just don’t have time for myself,” hesaid. One of his core beliefs was “Life is tough. You have to apply yourself.There’s no time for play.”When we began the session, Prem’s EEG showed a high degree of beta waves in boththe left and the right hemispheres of his brain. Beta is the wave typical ofstress. His alpha waves were minimal. Alpha is the ideal wave, one of relaxedalertness, linking the high and low frequencies.Prem’s EEG readout showed plenty of theta and delta, but his minimal alphaamplitude was like a bottleneck; he didn’t have access to his creative side. Hishigh amplitude of beta is also characteristic of people with chronic anxiety,stress, and burnout (Fehmi & Robbins, 2007).Once Prem settled into the EcoMeditation routine, he had big flares of alpha inboth the right and the left hemispheres of his brain, though larger on theright. His anxious, stressed-out beta waves disappeared. His brain began toproduce gamma waves, which it had not been doing before.Prem was not a meditator and said that he had taken meditation classes but neversucceeded in establishing a routine meditation practice. However, EcoMeditationquickly settled him into a deep state. His brain waves stabilized in theAwakened Mind pattern.In the absence of stress, the blood rushed back into his prefrontal cortex, andhis thinking became clear as he gained access to the biological and intellectualassets in the executive centers of his brain.At that workshop, we tested the biological responses of participants as well astheir psychological states before and after the workshop. Prem’s set point forcortisol, the primary stress hormone, dropped significantly. When our stresslevels drop, biological resources are freed up for cell repair, immunity, andother beneficial functions.This was evident in Prem’s levels of salivary immunoglobulin A (SIgA), a keyimmune marker. They rose significantly between the beginning and the end of theworkshop. His resting heart rate dropped from 79 to 64 beats per minute (bpm),while his blood pressure dropped from 118/80 to 108/70. All these indicatorsreflected the newly balanced function of his brain.Similar positive effects were noted for other workshop participants. For thewhole group, average cortisol levels declined and SIgA levels rose. Restingheart rate dropped from 70 to 66 (Groesbeck et al., 2016).Once we reversed the stress response with EcoMeditation, Prem began to see thelight side of life. The blood began to flow back into his forebrain and hiswhole hard drive came back online. He felt empowered. He knew he had resources.He knew he had the capacity for play. He regained a sense of control in hislife. He had a sense of agency, of self-efficacy, and his whole story changed.When I tested Prem afterward by having him repeat his opening statement that“Life is tough . . . there’s no time for play,” he burst into laughter. “Thatsounds like my dad speaking,” he observed, and he scowled and wagged his fingeras he mimicked a stern father rebuking his playful child.Prem practiced EcoMeditation throughout the workshop and, by the end, couldquickly induce that relaxed state. He began planning time to play guitar andhonor his creative side.image [images/p103.jpg]Session at a workshop with a participant hooked up to an EEG.WHEN CONSCIOUSNESS CHANGES, BRAIN WAVES CHANGEThe energy fields of brain waves and the matter of neural pathways are in aconstantly evolving dance. When consciousness changes, brain waves change anddifferent neural pathways are engaged.The extremes are love and fear. When we’re in a state of fear, our alpha bridgedisappears. We may still have theta and delta, but we’re cut off from theresources of our subconscious mind and its connection with the universal whole.Beta waves flood the fearful brain. It’s in survival mode.When we’re in a state of bliss, our brains show the Awakened Mind pattern. Astep beyond, they can also move to a symmetrical pattern Cade called the EvolvedMind. As our consciousness is filled with love, our brains function verydifferently, with large amounts of theta and delta, plus an alpha bridge toconnect our conscious with our subconscious mind.Emotions create brain states. Brain waves measure the fields generated byconsciousness. Passing signals through the neural bundles engaged by love, joy,and harmony creates a characteristic energy field (Wright, 2017). Whenmonitoring the brains of people doing EcoMeditation, EEG expert JudithPennington observed that “theta and delta progressed their patterns from theAwakened Mind to the Evolved Mind state.”Emotions also create neurotransmitters. Among these are serotonin, dopamine,endorphins, oxytocin, and anandamide (Kotler & Wheal, 2017). Serotonin isassociated with satisfaction, and dopamine with a sensation of reward.Endorphins block pain and increase pleasure. Oxytocin is the “bonding hormone,”and it stimulates feelings of closeness and intimacy with others. Anandamide iscalled the “bliss molecule,” and it’s named after the Sanskrit word forhappiness. It binds to the same receptors in the brain as THC, the primarypsychoactive molecule in marijuana. When mind changes, it creates molecularfacts in the form of these neurotransmitters. As they flood our brains, we feelsatisfied, secure, bonded, blissful, and serene. When our minds enter elevatedemotional states, we’re literally getting high—on drugs produced by our bodies.BRAIN WAVES EXPRESS THE FIELDS GENERATED BY EMOTIONAn influential study examined the brain wave patterns of meditators from fivedifferent contemplative traditions ranging from qigong to Zen (Lehmann et al.,2012). It compared their brain function in a normal state of consciousness andin meditation.One of the challenges of such research is that a single hour of EEG recordingsof a single subject yields millions of pieces of data. It tells you thepredominant frequencies of each part of the brain millisecond by millisecond,and these frequencies are changing constantly. Interpreting this huge mass ofdata requires experience and a model to describe what you’re looking for.After building a complete picture of how the entire brain functions, theinvestigators in this study concluded that the most informative model was tocompare beta with delta. They measured the ratio of beta to delta beforemeditation, during meditation, and after meditation. While the meditationtraditions offered very different teachings, from chanting to movement tositting still, what they all had in common was a reduction in beta and anincrease in delta.The researchers identified “globally reduced functional interdependence betweenbrain regions,” a change in brain function suggesting a dissolution of the senseof an isolated local self. This brain pattern of low beta and high deltatypified what they termed “the subjective experience of non-involvement,detachment and letting go, as well as of all-oneness and dissolution of egoborders” as the consciousness of meditators shifted into oneness with thenonlocal universal field.That is the same brain wave pattern I’ve seen in the EEG readouts of hundreds ofmeditators who are describing states of flow, altered consciousness, andconnection with the universal nonlocal field in which the borders of the localself dissolve.THE EXPERIENCE OF THE MYSTICSAt one workshop, we videotaped statements from people whose brains showedenormous amounts of delta. We asked them what they had experienced during themeditations. One woman named “Julie,” who suffered from depression, described itlike this:“At first, having my eyes closed was annoying. I could feel every littlescratchy itchy feeling in my skin. My throat tickled, and I wanted to cough. Icould hear the guy next to me breathing, and that was annoying too. But then Ibegan to forget about all that stuff, and a feeling of peace came over me.“I could feel the breath going inside my body. And going out again. It felt likea river flowing. I started to float, like I was a helium balloon or something.“I seemed to go to another place, and it was beautiful. I could feel the rocksand trees and ocean, and I seemed to be part of it all, like I was absorbed intothis perfection of everything there is in the cosmos.“These four huge blue beings drifted near me, and I felt incredible love andconnection flowing out of them. They were like outlines of people buttransparent and about 15 feet high. Made out of a beautiful royal blue mist.“I’ve been so worried about all the stuff going on in my life lately, but one ofthe beings drifted close to me and I felt reassured. Like she was telling meeverything is going to be okay. My heart filled up with love, and I realizedthat love is everything.“She gave me a shiny diamond crystal to remind me that she’s always there forme. I put it in my heart. It melted all the miserable, depressed pain that’sbeen living there for too long, and the pain became drops of water that fellinto the ground.“When you told us to come back into the room, I felt like I was a million milesaway. I brought that feeling of peace back into my body. It was hard to comeback, and I realize part of me is there all the time.”COMMONALITIES IN MYSTICAL EXPERIENCEWhat Julie described is a typical mystical experience. Human beings have beenhaving transcendent experiences since the dawn of consciousness, and hers hadcharacteristics similar to many others: * A pervasive feeling of peace * The falling away of worry and doubt * A felt sense of detachment from local self and the limitations of the body * An experience of oneness with nonlocal mind, including nature, the universe, and all of life * A meeting with a symbolic guide * Receiving a symbolic gift that carries healing power * The integration of the gift with her body and her local self * A sense of being changed by the experienceThe neuroscientists I’ve worked with have instructed experienced meditators toprovide prearranged signals during meditation, such as tapping their forefingerthree times when they feel the experience of oneness. We can time-stamp thisspot on the EEG readout. This has allowed us to correlate their internalexperience with brain states.When their local self abandons its preoccupation with the body to merge withnonlocal mind, we see large flares of delta. The high-amplitude delta wavebecomes stable when the meditators integrate the two states, such as when Juliecommuned with the blue being who gave her the gift (Pennington, 2017).Once people start to make meditation part of their daily lives, they develophigher amplitudes of alpha, theta, and delta than they had before.Mystical experiences throughout history show similarities. Tukaram, an Indiansaint of the 17th century, wrote the following poem, “When I Lose Myself inThee” (Hoyland, 1932):When thus I lose myself in Thee, my God,Then do I see, and know,That all Thy universe reveals Thy beauty,All living beings, and all lifeless things,Exist through thee.This whole vast world is but the formIn which Thou showest us Thyself,Is but the voice,In which Thyself Thou speakest unto us.What need of words?Come, Master, come,And fill me wholly with Thyself.In Tukaram’s poem, we can see characteristics similar to Julie’s experience. Heloses his sense of local self, disappearing into nonlocal consciousness. He hasan experience of oneness with the universe. He feels the universe communicatingwith him, a state of unity in which no words are necessary.Though there were no EEGs around in the 17th century to map the brain waves ofmystics such as Tukaram, we can infer the types of neural signaling occurring intheir brains by examining similar experiences in people like Julie.image [images/p108.jpg]Indian saint Ramakrishna often spontaneously entered states of mysticalexperience.Indian saint Ramakrishna (1836–1886) would go into states of bliss that lastedfor hours at a time. His body became stiff, and he became so absorbed in histranscendent experience that he was unaware of his surroundings. When he emergedfrom meditation, he was often unable to speak for a while. Once, after regainingthe power of speech, he described seeing a light like a million suns. A luminousform emerged from the light, took human shape, then reintegrated with the light.Theologian Huston Smith is the author of the textbook The World’s Religions andan expert on mystical experience. He states that experiences of oneness arecommon to mystics throughout history. The experience is not dependent on time orculture. Mystics aren’t talking secondhand about oneness; they’re talkingfirsthand about experiences of oneness (Smith, 2009).When they descend from the mountaintop, they share their experience with thosearound them. Inspired, their listeners often venerate them and may even buildreligions around them. What all the mystics are pointing to, however, is thedirect experience of oneness. This is an order removed from the secondhandexperience mediated by intercessors such as priests and religious rites.Mystics don’t disagree with one another or believe their own path is superior toanother, because they’ve all had the same experience. Only second-tier religiousauthorities come into conflict. While religions are different, the mysticalexperience is one. Smith holds that the mystical experience is the pinnacle ofhuman consciousness (Smith, 2009).The breakthrough of modern science is that we can now chart the information flowin the brains of mystics, just as the ancient mariners charted the unknown seas.Science is now showing us objectively what mystics like Smith have knownsubjectively, that mystical experience produces common and predictable patternsin the brain.The brain’s right parietal lobe is responsible for positioning the body inrelationship to its surroundings and distinguishing the boundary between selfand other. Neuroimaging studies show that in ecstatic states, this region goesoffline (Kotler & Wheal, 2017). When Ramakrishna and other mystics describetheir sense of local self fading into a merger with a universal nonlocal mind,the experience is echoed in the objective function of their brains. As theiroxytocin spikes, they bond with the universe, and as their brains flood withanandamide, they enter bliss.DELTA WAVES AND CONNECTION WITH NONLOCAL CONSCIOUSNESSMy friend and colleague Dr. Joe Dispenza has been collecting brain scans atmeditation workshops for many years and now has a compendium of over 10,000scans. Studying the patterns that are common to this group of mind maps gives usfascinating insights into the experience of workshop participants.What we see in Joe’s collection is people with much more theta and delta thanusual. The baseline amount of delta in the brains of meditators is much greaterthan those in “normal” brains (Thatcher, 1998). Meditators have practicedreleasing their attachment to local mind and immersing themselves in experiencesof oneness with nonlocal mind.Repeated meditation moves the brain into a new zone of functioning that includesmuch more delta than the old normal. When Joe tested first hundreds and thenthousands of such brains, what he noticed was that they were processinginformation in a way that was very different from the average brain (Dispenza,2017).Activity in many of these people is in the red zone, which means that the amountof delta is two deviations from the mean greater than that found in a databaseof normalized mind maps (Thatcher, 1998). The practical meaning of thisstatistic is that only 2.5 percent of the general population has the deltafunction we’re seeing in experienced meditators. Neuroscientists measuring thechanges in brain waves during Joe’s advanced workshops found that over the fourdays of a workshop, the brain’s baseline delta activity increases by an averageof 149 percent (Dispenza, 2017).Delta brain waves range in amplitude from 100 to 200 microvolts from peak totrough (ADInstruments, 2010). When testing people in EcoMeditation workshops, weoften see amplitudes of over 1,000 microvolts. Sometimes we see surges of over amillion microvolts. Most EEG equipment is not even able to measure so muchdelta.This correlates with powerful spiritual experiences such as the ones reported bytoday’s Julie and yesterday’s Tukaram. They have been reported by mystics fromall traditions for thousands of years. We can’t objectively measure anexperience like the sense of local self and local mind dissolving into nonlocalself and universal mind. We can, however, measure how the brain having such anexperience processes information. The common denominator is enormous amplitudesof delta waves. This energy is matched by molecules like serotonin and dopamine,as well as the ecstasy neurotransmitter anandamide and the bonding hormoneoxytocin. These types of experience are not isolated exceptions. Research showsthat 40 percent of Americans and 37 percent of Britons have had at least onetranscendent experience that took them beyond local mind. Often they describe itas the most important experience of their lives, shaping everything that camelater (Greeley, 1975; Castro, Burrows, & Wooffitt, 2014).Few talked about their experiences with others, however. Children didn’t tellparents. Patients didn’t tell doctors. Wives didn’t tell husbands. Because thistype of conversation is outside our normal social conventions, we don’t have thelanguage or context to conduct it.That doesn’t mean these experiences aren’t happening. When we start to look forthem, encounters with nonlocal mind are all around us.THETA WAVES AND HEALINGSometimes such altered brain states are accompanied by rapid healing. In ameditation workshop taught by Joe Dispenza, a Mexican man we’ll call “José”described similar mystical experiences (Dispenza, 2017).José had come to the workshop shortly after being diagnosed with a cancerousbrain tumor. He was due for a life-threatening operation soon. During one of themeditations, José—like Julie—saw otherworldly beings. One of them reached hishand into José’s skull and rooted around inside for a while. José felt vividphysical sensations as though his scalp were being cut open and his brain tissuerearranged.The day after the workshop, José rearranged his schedule so that he could get anew X-ray. He flew to Houston to consult with doctors at MD Anderson, a famouscancer clinic, before returning home. The new scan, taken just a day after theworkshop, showed that all traces of the tumor had disappeared.During intense healing experiences, we often see high amplitudes of theta waveson the EEG. Theta has been mapped as the signature brain wave during energyhealing sessions (Benor, 2004). If one person is offering healing to another, wesee big theta waves in first the healer, then the healee. The switch oftenhappens at the moment the healer feels his or her hands becoming warm—thesubjective experience of energy flow (Bengston, 2010).In one study, a healer and client were both hooked up to EEGs. The healer’s EEGreadout showed 14 periods of sustained theta at the frequency of exactly 7.81Hz. The client’s EEG shifted to the same frequency, demonstrating entrainmentbetween healer and healee (Hendricks, Bengston, & Gunkelman, 2010).THE DOCTOR WHO COULDN’T HEALIn one of my trainings, “Anise,” a brilliant doctor, volunteered to work on herissues in front of the whole group while hooked up to an EEG monitor. Anise hadearned not only an M.D. but also a doctorate in pharmacology. In addition, shewas certified in healing touch and several other modalities.Anise had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia 13 years earlier. The symptoms, suchas joint pain, fatigue, and “brain fog,” were sometimes severe, other times lessso. She had eventually become so debilitated, however, that she was no longerable to work.On the day of the training, her pain level was 7 out of 10, and her brain fogwas so extreme that she was barely able to comprehend the lectures. She walkedwith difficulty and needed to prop herself up with three pillows in order tofeel comfortable enough to function.Anise had a high degree of frustration and anger at herself because her husband,“Dal,” who was also attending the workshop, now had the whole financial burdenof providing for the family, including their two teenage daughters. Anothersource of anger was the experience that “despite all my training, I can’t healmyself.”Although we sometimes see “one-minute wonders” during workshops, this was notthe case for Anise. Hers was a long and complicated session. She had difficultycreating a vision for her future because she could not imagine herself gettingbetter.Gestalt therapist Byron Katie has clients ask themselves provocative questionsthat challenge their assumptions about self and the world. One of thesequestions is “Who would I be without this story?” Another way of asking it is“What contribution is this disability making to my life?”I asked this of Anise. The question triggered a memory of a time when she waseight years old and being emotionally abused by a family member. She got sick,and her illness became her shield. When Anise was bedridden, she could retreatinto her bedroom and didn’t have to deal with her tormentor.Once we identified the core issue that sickness might be a solution masqueradingas a problem, we used energy psychology techniques to release all her anger ather childhood persecutor, who was still very much present in her life.Her pain went down to a 1 out of 10, and she began to smile and then laugh atthe predicament she’d created for herself. “My nemesis has never becomesuccessful,” she realized, and she felt empowered in that relationship for thefirst time in her adult life.She began to talk about the possibilities for her future. She’d been offered agreat job in Brazil but hadn’t considered it because she didn’t think she couldfunction physically without the resources she enjoyed in the United States. Nowthat possibility opened up for her. “How about it?” she asked her husband. “Iwould love to,” Dal responded, his eyes shining.At the end of our session, Anise stood up and walked around the room. As herpain subsided completely, she swung her arms and legs freely, with a full rangeof motion. She left the workshop that day to have dinner with Dal and discusstheir positive future. Not only had her consciousness shifted, but her body hadbeen freed up dramatically as well.CONSCIOUSNESS SHIFTS THE WAY THE BRAIN PROCESSES INFORMATIONDuring sessions with clients hooked up to an EEG, what we typically see at thestart of a session is a lot of high beta, indicating worry and stress. There’slittle alpha, gamma, or theta. The absence of alpha means clients are unable tobridge their conscious minds (beta) and their creativity, intuition, andconnection to the universal field (theta and delta).As clients experience flashes of insight, we see large flares of alpha in boththe left and the right hemispheres of the brain. During Anise’s aha moment ofrealizing that her tormentor had never become anything like as successful as shewas, her alpha flared out so wide that it exceeded the measuring capability ofour device.By the end of the session, we saw the typical Awakened Mind pattern in Anise’sbrain. She had a small amount of high beta, indicating that her criticalthinking capacities were online. But she had more SMR (low beta), showing thatshe was in touch with her body. She had large amounts of theta and an evengreater amplitude of delta, showing a connection with her creativity, intuition,and the universal information field. Her gamma had increased, demonstrating agreater ability to make connections between disparate parts of the brain andprocess information in an integrated way.While her psychological breakthroughs were profound, her physiologicalfunctioning as diagrammed on her EEG readouts showed real-time brain changes.She wasn’t simply experiencing a psychological change; the way her brainorganized information was shifting too.This is more than simply a change in the mind. This is a change in the brainitself, as new neural bundles wire themselves together. New neural bundles areconstantly being formed and old ones pruned throughout our lives (Restak, 2001).When we meditate, tap, use another form of energy psychology, or otherwise shiftour consciousness, the brain changes quickly. The brain can be intentionallychanged by the mind, especially by what is known as attention training (Schwartz& Begley, 2002). True transformation repatterns neural pathways. Eventually, theentire state of the brain shifts and establishes a new and healthy level ofhomeostasis.One research team notes that “an accelerating number of studies in theneuroimaging literature significantly support the thesis that . . . withappropriate training and effort, people can systematically alter neuralcircuitry associated with a variety of mental and physical states that arefrankly pathological” (Schwartz, Stapp, & Beauregard, 2005). We can take ourdysfunctional brain networks and alter them with our minds.It’s not just mystics and healers who produce large alpha bridges and thetaflares when they’re in ecstatic states. Groups for whom high performance iscritical are finding that tuning the brain in this way produces big leaps inachievement. U.S. Navy SEALs need to operate effectively in rapidly changingcombat conditions. Using millions of dollars of advanced EEG equipment in a“Mind Gym” specially constructed in Norfolk, Virginia, they learn to enter astate they call ecstasis (Cohen, 2017). Once they “flip the switch” intoecstasis, their brains are in a state of flow, an altered reality in whichsuper-performance becomes possible. Other peak performers, such as elitecourtroom lawyers, Olympic athletes, and Google executives, also trainthemselves to enter ecstasis.The characteristics of these flow states are described in the book Stealing Fire(Kotler & Wheal, 2017). Among them are selflessness and timelessness. People inecstasis transcend the boundaries of local mind. EEG readings show that theprefrontal cortex of their brains, the seat of a sense of self, shuts down.Beta-wave mental chatter ceases. They gain distance from the anxious obsessionsof local mind. Their internal chemistry changes as “feel-good” neurotransmitterslike serotonin, dopamine, anandamide, and oxytocin flood their brains.In this state they gain a nonlocal perspective. They are open to an infiniterange of possible options and outcomes. The self, rather than being trapped in alimited fixed local reality, is able to try on different possibilities. This“knocks out filters we normally apply to incoming information,” leading toassociative leaps that facilitate problem solving and super-creativity. Kotlerand Wheal (2017) review the research on the performance gains produced by thesebrain wave states. These include a 490 percent improvement in mental focus, adoubling of creativity, and a 500 percent increase in productivity.During ecstasis, whether found in the ancient accounts of Tukaram or the modernexperiences of Julie and the Navy SEALs, people have common experiences. Theseare linked to neurotransmitters: entering a state of bliss (anandamide), a senseof detachment from the body that encapsulates the local self (endorphins), localself bonding with the nonlocal universe (oxytocin), serenity (serotonin), andthe reward of being changed by the experience (dopamine).These are the characteristics of upgraded minds, and we now have EEGs andneurotransmitter assays to measure the changes they produce in matter. In thepast, ecstatic states were attainable only by mystics, and it took decades ofstudy, rigorous practice, ascetic discipline, and spiritual initiation. Today,“we now know the precise adjustments to body and brain that let us recreate themfor ourselves” at will; technology is providing us with “a Cliff Notes versionof . . . how to encounter the divine” (Kotler & Wheal, 2017). Today, thehighest-performing humans in the fields of sports, business, combat, science,meditation, and art are inducing them routinely. Tomorrow, as we map thephysiology of these states and turn ecstasis into a learnable skill, they willbe available to everyone.MY BRIEF CAREER AS AN ARTIST, OR DODGING THE BULLETS OF BELIEFMy career as an artist began at age five and started off badly.My family had just transplanted themselves to America, and I found myselfinvoluntarily incarcerated in Howard Elementary School in Colorado Springs,Colorado. My British accent attracted unfavorable attention from the teachers.To fix the problem, they consigned me to remedial speech classes, where Ideveloped a stutter and a speech impediment.One day, I brought an art project home to show my parents. Along with all theother kindergartners, I’d been instructed to draw a cowboy. I did my best, andmy teacher noticed how good the drawing looked. Flushed with this rare show ofapproval, I took my drawing home and showed my mother.She burst out laughing and ridiculed the drawing. She danced around the diningroom, shrieking and pantomiming the anatomically inaccurate angles of thecowboy’s arms and legs. Crushed, I retreated to the bunk bed on the enclosedporch that I shared with my sister. I never drew another human form again,confining my doodles to ships and aircraft.Until I turned 45 years old.I began to meditate daily as well as tap regularly. I examined my core beliefs.One of these was I’m no good at art.Is that really true? I asked myself. Along with a woman I was close to at thetime, who happened to own an art gallery, I signed up for a one-day watercolorclass at the local college.The moment I picked up the brush, it felt alive in my hand. I entered aneffortless state of flow. I felt as though I’d been painting for a century. Iwas a sponge for knowledge, learning every technique the teacher knew in justthat one day. My artsy girlfriend couldn’t believe I was a novice and suspectedI’d obtained a clandestine degree in art somewhere along the line.Next, I took a two-day class in painting the human face in watercolor. I againsucked the teacher dry, insisting on knowing her advanced techniques before theend of the first day.I then began to paint regularly. Being a methodical sort, I numbered eachpainting in the order I completed it—1, 2, 3, and so on—instead of giving themnames. They were mostly faces. I painted my love. I painted my confusion. Ipainted my pain.image [images/p116.jpg]Watercolor #13: Angel of destiny.Once I had eight paintings, I took the best four to a localcoffee-shop-cum-art-gallery. The owner was impressed and booked me for a one-manshow. The opening was in six weeks. “Come the day before and hang 36 pieces,” hesaid.I tried to look nonchalant as I walked out the door, but inside I was quaking.Thirty-six pieces! He didn’t know I’d only done eight in my whole life, if youexclude the cowboy. Now I had to come up with around 30 more in six weeks, ontop of my 60-hour workweek and being a single dad to my two young children!During breaks at work, I began to paint methodically. I realized I could meetthe deadline, but only if I took a cue from Henry Ford and set up my paintingson a production line. Very un-artsy, but necessary.I arranged three easels side by side in a row. Each watercolor wash takes about10 minutes to dry before you can apply the next one. So I would apply a layer toone easel and then work on the following one. Then on to the third. By the timeI circled back to the first painting, the wash had dried, and I could repeat theprocess.Watercolor is a demanding medium. The paint is transparent, so you can’t coverup a mistake the way you can using opaque media like oil or acrylic. If you messup a wash or allow a drop of the wrong color to fall on the paper, the paintingis ruined. The pressure was on to finish and frame those 30 paintings. As Ientered the flow state, I found that I could hold the plan of each of the threepaintings in my mind while simultaneously applying the paint effortlessly.I met the deadline and opened my first art show. People loved the images, and Isold several pieces. Emboldened, I approached the most prestigious local venue,City Hall. They rotated local artists every few weeks. Again, the managerimmediately booked me for a one-man show. Again, I painted and enjoyed theprocess of exhibiting.Then the opportunity arose to co-author a book, called Soul Medicine, with mymentor, Dr. Norm Shealy. I decided to switch my energies and very limited freetime into writing instead of painting. Halfway through the largest and mostambitious piece I’d ever painted, I laid down my brushes forever and began towrite instead.image [images/p118.jpg]Art show invitation.The experience was full of lessons for me. One is that our heads are full ofbeliefs that aren’t true—in my case, things like the core belief I’m no good atart. Another lesson is that these core beliefs arise from early childhoodexperiences. They shape our entire lives, and unless we challenge them, we canspend our lives demonstrating the lies we were told as children. Most of mysubsequent career has been spent helping other people identify and challengetheir limiting core beliefs.One of the friends who came to the grand opening of my City Hall exhibit was awoman named Alice. She was a fused-glass artist who had been struggling to makea living at her craft for years. Alice said to me, “I’m awed. One-person showsare impossible to get. I’ve never been able to land one.” I didn’t reply toAlice. Inside my head, I wiped my metaphorical brow and thought, Whew, I’m gladI didn’t know that. I’ve only had two shows. I had no idea they were hard toland.Another watercolor artist at the reception painted landscapes. She exclaimed,“But you paint portraits. Faces are the most difficult thing to paint inwatercolor!” My mental self-talk was: Who knew? Not me . . . Dodged anotherbelief bullet.Once I disintegrated one belief, I began to disintegrate others. I began toquestion all the beliefs that had kept me small and limited. I began to reclaimparts of myself that I’d disowned because of the disapproval of parents,teachers, partners, and friends. I began to find out who I was and become thatperson, instead of confining myself to the limitations set up by the peoplearound me.That’s what the human potential movement is all about. We have vast abilities,powers, and insights within. They may be constrained by the blindness of thepeople around us, but they’re still there. We’re much bigger than we’vebelieved. Once we begin to take off the blinders and step into our fullmagnificence, we become shapers of the world around us rather than reflectionsof the limitations of the past.image [images/p119.jpg]Watercolor #21: Heart’s Too Big.Every moment is the moment you decide: Will I be that magnificence, or will Icontinue to pretend I’m less than what I know I am?Imagine if I had played it safe and stuck with my trusty tried-and-true corebelief I’m no good at art. Imagine if I’d consulted my experienced friends inadvance and discovered that one-man shows are impossible to obtain and thatfaces are the most difficult thing to paint. The result would have been no artclasses, no one-man shows, no explosion of creativity, perhaps no book and nolife-changing career in writing and research. That’s the consequence of livingin the box of your old beliefs: no new mind, no new matter—instead of living inan open world of new mind, new matter.As a thought experiment, imagine that you continue, for the rest of your life,to hold the beliefs about yourself that you hold today. That’s one option at thefork in the road ahead. If you take the other direction at the fork, youchallenge every limiting belief in your head and reach out far ahead for yourpotential. You succeed sometimes, you fail at other times, but either way yougrow. You start to discover the boundaries of who you really are instead of theboundaries your teachers and parents held about you. Your new mind becomes yournew matter.You truly are at the crossroads at this very minute. Which direction will youchoose? My mission in this book is to encourage you to say, “I know I havegreatness in me, and I’m determined to express it fully!”Social scientists used to believe that our personality is formed very early inlife and does not change much over time. A 1989 headline in the New York Timesproclaimed “Personality: Major Traits Found Stable through Life” (Goleman,1987). It reported on a study showing that our core traits, such as anxiety,friendliness, and appetite for new experiences, are fixed.The longest personality study ever conducted, however, shows that ourpersonalities can change beyond recognition over the course of our lives(Harris, Brett, Johnson, & Deary, 2016). It began with data from a 1950 surveyof 1,208 14-year-olds. Six questionnaires were used by their teachers toevaluate six personality traits.Sixty years later, researchers tracked down the original respondents, now agedon average 77. They found that there was little overlap with their teenageselves. Where they expected to find a good deal of stability of personalitytraits, they were surprised to find little, with one exclaiming that “there ishardly any relationship at all” (Goldhill, 2017).Our childhood beliefs and traits don’t have to dog us through life. As we takeresponsibility for change and practice desirable habits of mind consistently, wecan shift dramatically. The changes might not show up in a week or a month, butconsistent practice over time can turn you into a completely different person.EMOTIONS SHAPE THE WORLD AROUND USWe think of ourselves as autonomous individuals, making our own decisions andleading our own lives. In reality, we are part of a matrix of connection. We areconnected to each other through our neural networks and by means of invisibleenergy fields.Our thoughts and emotions are not contained within our minds and bodies. Theyaffect people around us, often without their knowledge. Their thoughts andemotions are affecting us too—at the subconscious and unconscious levels.Prior research has shown that brains synchronize when sharing information. Whenone person speaks while another listens, the brain regions active in the speakerlight up in the listener too.Biomedical engineers at Drexel University, in collaboration with psychologistsat Princeton, developed a wearable brain-imaging headband to measure thisphenomenon (Liu et al., 2017). It builds on work using functional magneticresonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the activity of the language areas of thebrain. Especially when the speaker is describing a vivid and emotionalexperience, the listener’s brain activity mirrors that of the speaker.The researchers recorded one English-speaking subject and two Turkish-speakingsubjects telling a real-life story. Their brains were scanned while they werespeaking. The recording was then played back to 15 English-only speakers whilethe investigators measured activity in the parietal and prefrontal areas of thelisteners’ brains. These regions are involved in our ability to discern thegoals, desires, and beliefs of other people. Those areas lit up when thelisteners heard the English story but not the Turkish ones. The researchers alsofound that the greater the degree of “coupling” between brain areas in listenerand speaker, the better the degree of comprehension. This shows that the betterour brains are at mirroring the experience of others, the more we understandthem.image [images/p121.jpg]Brain coupling during communication.ENERGY FIELDS AT A DISTANCEEnergy fields can affect others at a distance as well. Eric Leskowitz, M.D., apsychiatrist from Harvard Medical School’s Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital,visited the Institute of HeartMath in Boulder Creek, California, in 2007. Whileblindfolded and meditating, his heart rate and heart coherence were continuouslymonitored by the lab technicians.Heart coherence is associated with increased alpha brain wave activity. It is astate in which the interval between heartbeats is regular and constant. It’sproduced by positive emotions such as love and compassion. Negative emotionsdisrupt heart coherence.At random intervals unknown to Leskowitz, expert meditators standing behind himwere given a signal to enter heart coherence themselves. As they did so,Leskowitz’s heart coherence also increased (Leskowitz, 2007). Without touchinghim, they were able to shift his heart-brain function.A follow-up study measured the same effect in 25 volunteers in a series of 148ten-minute trials, and it found the same phenomenon of heart entrainment at adistance (Morris, 2010). The author stated that “a coherent energy field can begenerated and/or enhanced by the intentions of small groups of participants. . .. The evidence of heart rhythm synchronization across participants supports thepossibility of heart-to-heart bio-communications.”Our bodies and brains are synchronizing with people around us all the time. Whenwe observe others being touched, our brains light up in the same way as if wewere being touched (Schaefer, Heinze, & Rotte, 2012). That’s because our brainscontain mirror neurons that echo the sensations we’re observing. These mirrorneurons even fire in sympathy with facial expressions and tones of voice,indicating that we are very sensitive to both verbal and nonverbal emotionalcues provided by those around us.It is not only positive emotions that can be transmitted from person to person.Our brains are also attuned to the pain of another. Researchers in Birmingham,England, showed college students images of people suffering from localizedsports injuries or from receiving injections. Almost a third of the studentsfelt pain at the same site portrayed in the photographs they were looking at.image [images/p123.jpg]Receiving an injection.The researchers then used an fMRI machine to compare the brains of 10 studentswho had felt only an emotional reaction to the images against another 10students who had actually felt physical pain. All 20 students showed increasedactivity in the areas of the brain that process emotions. But only those who hadactually felt the pain physically had activity in the brain regions that processpain (Osborn & Derbyshire, 2010).As another example, babies cry not just when family members are in distress, buteven when strangers are upset (Zahn-Waxler, Radke-Yarrow, Wagner, & Chapman,1992). Their nervous systems have a high degree of entrainment with those aroundthem, and the structures in the emotion-processing parts of their brains lightup in response to the emotions of others.EMOTIONAL CONTAGIONEmotions are contagious (Hatfield, Cacioppo, & Rapson, 1994). When your bestfriend laughs, you’re likely to laugh along with her. When she’s depressed,you’re equally likely to feel blue too. Just as you can get the flu by walkinginto a classroom full of sick second-graders, you can pick up emotions from thepeople around you—for instance, walking into that classroom and feeling happywhen you hear all the second-graders laughing at a joke. Emotions are contagiousin the same way infectious diseases are contagious. This isn’t only true ofnegative emotions such as fear, stress, and sadness. It is also the case for joyand contentment (Chapman & Sisodia, 2015).Framingham is a charming New England town in Massachusetts, 19 miles fromBoston. Now home to 17,000 families, it was first settled in the mid-1600s. Latein that century, Framingham received an influx of families from nearby Salem,people who were seeking to escape the infamous Salem witch trials. That part oftown is still called Salem’s End.In medical literature, the town is famous for the Framingham Heart Study. In1948, a farsighted group of researchers from the National Heart Institute set upan ambitious research project to find the cause of heart disease and stroke,both of which had been rising steadily in the first half of the century.image [images/p124.jpg]Framingham Common.They recruited 5,209 Framingham residents between the ages of 30 and 62 andperformed a comprehensive battery of psychological and physical tests. Subjectsreturned every two years for follow-up. In 1971, the study enrolled a secondgeneration, consisting of 5,124 of the original participants’ children and thechildren’s spouses, and today many of the grandchildren and great-grandchildrenof the original participants still participate.The gold mine of data obtained by the study has enabled researchers to look atmuch more than heart disease. A sub-study of 4,739 people over 20 years lookedat their happiness levels and how these levels affected those around them(Fowler & Christakis, 2008).This study found that one person’s happiness can boost that of another for timeperiods as long as a year. When a person in the Framingham social network becamehappy, the chances that a neighbor, spouse, sibling, or friend would becomehappy increased up to 34 percent. Living within a mile of a friend who becamehappy increased a participant’s chance of happiness by 25 percent.“You would think that your emotional state would depend on your own choices andactions and experience,” observed study co-author Nicholas Christakis, a medicalsociologist at Harvard University. “But it also depends on the choices andactions and experiences of other people, including people to whom you are notdirectly connected. Happiness is contagious.” Barbara Fredrickson, the author ofLove 2.0, calls this positivity resonance (Fredrickson, 2013). When thefrequency of our consciousness is love, we naturally connect with others whoresonate with that shared energy field.THE RIPPLE EFFECT OF HAPPINESSNot only did happy people affect those around them, but happiness also showed aripple effect. Three degrees of separation out, people became happier. Having afriend know someone who was happy increased the chances of happiness by as muchas 15 percent, and even in the next layer out, the likelihood was still 6percent.Negative emotions were also contagious, but not as much. Having an unhappyconnection increased the chances of unhappiness by an average of 7 percent, asopposed to 9 percent for happiness.Emotional contagion is present in groups too (Barsade, 2002). It can influencegroup dynamics and can lead to improved cooperation, enhanced task performance,and decreased conflict. “Emotional contagion, through its direct influence onemployees’ and work teams’ emotions, judgments, and behaviors, can lead tosubtle but important ripple effects in groups and organizations,” says SigalBarsade, author of several influential studies of emotional contagion. Positiveemotion and mood in a team member, especially the leader, enhances theperformance of the whole team. But stressed leaders will degrade the performanceof everyone around them.AN ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE CORRODED BY EMOTIONAL CONTAGIONBy Stacene CourvallisOur company manufactures specialized construction equipment, and is admired byothers in our industry as an example of tightly-focused growth.As the recent construction boom expanded, so did we. We hired a lot of newpeople quickly, and one of those was Wilma, a senior executive who reported tome. Her resume looked perfect, and she’d passed the interviewing process withflying colors.Three months into her job, her performance was good, but Wilma had begun sharingconcerns with me about various projects and people. A couple of other executiveswho usually left work early. A budget overrun in another department. An engineerwith sensitive proprietary information who was friends with a peer at acompeting company.She framed her observations in terms of concern for the health of ourorganization, and I was grateful to her for pointing them out.image [images/p126.jpg]Emotional energy, whether positive or negative, spreads throughout a team.Soon Wilma’s gripe sessions became a regular part of my workload, and shecontinued to discover problems. She felt that the corporate culture was too laxand that the other executives didn’t give me enough respect. She believed weneeded to sharpen our mission statement and our goals. She believed we coulddownsize our workforce and increase our profit margins.I started to wonder if there was much more wrong with the company than I hadperceived, and I became suspicious of other members of the executive team. Theexuberant, fun tone of our office began to erode, despite our acceleratingfinancial success.Then our CFO, Jason, asked for a confidential meeting with me. He told me thatWilma had been talking to him about the failings of others in the office, andJason did not believe her concerns were warranted. As I dug deeper, I discovereda pattern. She took other executives into her confidence, smearing all themanagers except the person she was talking to.I also realized that the real problem was me. I had been sucked into Wilma’sstories, and lost my own sense of trust in our people, and security in thecompany’s direction. I had been unconsciously transmitting this to the rest ofthe team, leading to the loss of our emotionally uplifting organizationalculture.Some quick web searches soon revealed that this malaise had a name: emotionalcontagion. Unhealthy emotions can spread among people in close proximity justthe way diseases spread. Our whole company had become infected.Once I identified emotional contagion, I could see it in every organization Iencountered. I went into a courtroom and felt the thick fog of discontent andunhappiness that filled the building. I went into the local music store andnoticed that the smiles of employees seemed genuine, and they were truly havingfun as they interacted together.I let Wilma go late on a Friday afternoon. On Monday morning, the mood in theentire office had changed. People were relaxed once again. Our company felt likea fun and creative place to work once more. The flow of conversation was nolonger guarded. Trust had returned. With the carrier of the bad feelingsremoved, the previous positive emotional tone quickly reasserted itself. Best ofall, I felt good about myself and the company again.EMOTIONAL CONTAGION SHAPES THE WORLDEmotions aren’t contagious just at the level of a team, family, or community.They’re contagious on the much larger scale of social networks.A massive experiment with 689,003 Facebook users found that emotional contagiondoesn’t even require contact between people (Kramer, Guillory, & Hancock, 2014).Entire groups of people can come into emotional coherence, and their brain waveschange, potentially generating a huge combined field.The study used an automated system to change the amount of emotional content inthe news feeds of Facebook users. When user timelines were manipulated to reducepositive emotions, according to the study authors, “People produced fewerpositive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced,the opposite pattern occurred.”This demonstrates that “Emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence ourown emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion viasocial networks.” It showed that nonverbal cues and personal interaction weren’tnecessary for emotional contagion to occur.Though it’s happening below the level of our conscious awareness, we’re sharingour emotions with others all the time, including through online social networks.A study conducted by the University of Vermont found that photographs posted onInstagram reflect the mood of the person posting them. The researchers comparedphotos posted by depressed people with those posted by people who were notdepressed. They compared 43,950 photos posted by 166 individuals. Half of thesehad been diagnosed with clinical depression during the previous three years(Reece & Danforth, 2017).The investigators discovered that depressed people manipulated their photos tohave darker tones. Their most popular choice of filter was one called Inkwell,which removes color and makes photos black and white. Happy people were morelikely to use a filter called Valencia, which gives photos a warmer and brightertone. Depressed people literally drained the color out of what they shared withothers.Using these color choices as a tool for diagnosing depression was successful 70percent of the time. That’s substantially higher than the 42 percent successrate of general practice doctors.THE NUREMBERG RALLIESThe unconscious spread of negative emotions has been directing human societiesfor millennia, long before social media came along. It’s nothing new. Examplesof mass hysteria can be found throughout the pages of history. In the 1930s,Adolf Hitler staged huge rallies in Nuremberg, Germany, to whip up enthusiasmand showcase the power of Germany and the National Socialist Party to the nationand the world.Huge banners, goose-stepping marchers, martial songs, torchlit processions,fireworks, and bonfires enthralled the hundreds of thousands of spectators. Longspeeches by Adolf Hitler and other Nazi Party luminaries laid out partyideology. The emotional contagion of the spectacular events helped unite thecountry behind Hitler’s vision.The 1934 rally drew over a million people. The American journalist WilliamShirer had recently arrived to cover Germany for the Hearst newspaper group anddecided to attend. In his diary, he records his impressions of his first eveningin the grand medieval city. He found himself carried along in a wave ofhumanity. In front of the hotel where Hitler was staying, 10,000 people chanted,“We want our Führer!”image [images/p129.jpg]Adolf Hitler addressing the 1934 Nuremberg rally.Shirer wrote, “I was a little shocked at the faces, especially those of thewomen, when Hitler finally appeared on the balcony for a moment. They remindedme of the crazed expressions I once saw in the back country of Louisiana on thefaces of some Holy Rollers. . . . They looked up at him as if he were a Messiah,their faces transformed into something positively inhuman.”The following morning, Shirer attended the opening ceremony of the rally. Hewrote, “I’m beginning to comprehend, I think, some of the reasons for Hitler’sastounding success. . . . This morning’s opening meeting . . . was more than agorgeous show; it also had something of the mysticism and religious fervor of anEaster or Christmas Mass in a great Gothic cathedral. The hall was a sea ofbrightly colored flags. Even Hitler’s arrival was made dramatic. The bandstopped playing. There was a hush over the thirty thousand people packed in thehall. Then the band struck up the Badenweiler March. . . . Hitler appeared inthe back of the auditorium and followed by his aides, Göring, Goebbels, Hess,Himmler, and the others, he strode slowly down the long centre aisle whilethirty thousand hands were raised in salute.”To those attending, the event was intoxicating. Shirer records that “Every worddropped by Hitler seemed like an inspired Word from on high. Man’s—or at leastthe German’s—critical faculty is swept away at such moments, and every liepronounced is accepted as high truth itself” (Shirer, 1941).That’s the power of emotional contagion. Like the reign of Hitler, the Salemwitch trials, the Red Scare of the 1960s, the 1994 Rwandan genocide, the 2003Iraq war, the Great Recession of 2007, and the North Korean nuclear standoff,such times of mass hysteria usually end badly for all concerned.MARKET AND COMMODITY BUBBLESStock market bubbles are another example of emotional contagion. Investorsforget the ups and downs of the business cycle in a wave of speculative buying.In 1996, Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan called it “irrationalexuberance.” In his book The Ascent of Money, historian Niall Ferguson states,“Booms and busts are products, at root, of our emotional volatility” (Ferguson,2008).image [images/p131.jpg]Ratios of the stock prices of companies relative to their income as of February20, 2018 (Shiller, 2017). The historic median is 16, meaning that company stocksare typically valued at 16 times their historic earnings. Ratios above 16indicate a bubble. In early 2018, the ratio stood at 33.On October 16, 1929, Irving Fisher, an economics professor at Yale University,announced that American stock prices had “reached what looks like a permanentlyhigh plateau.”He was very wrong. The market slipped a few days later, then crashed and crashedagain. Over the next three years, the market declined by 89 percent. It did notregain its 1929 level until 1954.In seeking to explain the crash, legendary economist John Maynard Keynes waswell aware of the emotional contagion that had gripped the national psyche,calling it a “failure of the immaterial devices of the mind” (Ferguson, 2008).Bubbles have been seen throughout history. In 1634, the prices of Dutch tulipbulbs began to rise, and speculators entered the market. The Dutch tulip maniabegan. Some bulbs changed hands 10 times a day, at ever higher prices. ByJanuary 1637, rare tulip bulbs sold for more than the price of a house. OnFebruary 5, the bubble abruptly collapsed.image [images/p132.jpg]Wagon of Fools by Hendrik Gerritsz Pot.The emotional contagion of tulip mania was captured in a 1637 painting byHendrik Gerritsz Pot called Wagon of Fools. It depicts a group of Dutch weaverswho have dropped their looms to follow a wagon topped by Flora, goddess offlowers. She carries bouquets of tulips in her arms and is accompanied byalcoholics, moneylenders, and the double-faced goddess Fortuna. The assembly isbeing led to their deaths in the sea.The feelings we feel when our brain wave patterns are hijacked by emotionalcontagion are real. We have a spike in stress-related beta waves and a drop inalpha. It takes a strong mind to remain unaffected by the mass hysteria aroundus. We can’t easily discern an emotion being given to us secondhand from onearising within our own neural network.MAPPING THE ENLIGHTENED BRAINHistorical observers have been able to describe the extremes of consciousness.The continuum ranges from the emotional contagion that drives wholecivilizations to war to the enlightened states of the mystics.Modern neuroscience, however, gives us the ability to map the neural signalinginvolved in consciousness and describe the signaling pathways active in theemotional brain.When we record the brain waves of people having mystical experiences, wetranslate subjective states of consciousness into objective pictures of brainfunction. As consciousness shifts away from fear, distress, and the worries ofthe local mind, brain waves change. This indicates that different neuralpathways are being engaged, which in turn alters the brain’s electromagneticfield. Subjective feelings of inner peace can now be mapped objectively usingEEGs to provide an objective picture of information flow in the brain.During mystical experiences, mind leaves matter. Consciousness ceases toidentify exclusively with the local self, and EEG readings show large flares ofalpha waves as the alpha bridge is created between conscious and unconsciousreality.Consciousness then transcends attachment to the local self to merge withnonlocal mind. The EEG shows first flares and then large, steady amplitudes ofdelta waves, the signature wave of nonlocal mind and connection with theuniversal field.When altered states are experienced, the EEG records large amplitudes of alpha,theta, and delta simultaneously. When physical healing takes place, such as thedissolution of José’s tumor, flares of theta are usually evident.In this union of local brain and nonlocal mind, a transformation occurs. Symbolssuch as the beings Julie saw and the crystal she received become emblems of anew personal reality that integrates local and nonlocal mind. At the conclusionof the mystical experience, the person returns to local reality. However, theyare changed. They may have brought back a gift representing emotional orphysical healing, such as the crystal Julie placed in her heart. The processproduces a release of old stuck energy—in Julie’s case, the depression thatmelted like raindrops and fell to the ground. They may experience physicalhealing, such as the disappearance of José’s brain tumor.Matter is changed by mind. Many studies show that meditators have higher volumesof brain tissue, better sleep, fewer diseases, increased immunity, enhancedemotional health, reduced inflammation, slower aging, increased intercellularcommunication, balanced neurotransmitters, greater longevity, and less stress.Our transformed mental, emotional, and physical states then radiate around us.As we become happier, we affect the people we associate with. They in turnaffect people around them, and the effects of mind change ripple through thecommunity. Positive emotional contagion occurs.Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin coined the term noosphere,sometimes translated as orb of awareness, to describe the field of consciousnessproduced by humankind. Include all the rest of life on Earth and you have thepsychosphere, or orb of consciousness of everything in the field. I also use theterm emosphere to describe the collective emotional tone of the planet.We are part of the field of healing in the psychosphere of humankind. Our energyis out of phase with the negative emotions infecting society; we don’tparticipate in those fields. Our change of mind has produced a new materialreality, one that supports our health and spiritual transformation.PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEActivities to practice this week: * Practice EcoMeditation for at least 10 minutes each morning and evening. * Foster positive emotional contagion by deliberately connecting with other people. * Spend at least 10 minutes with your spouse at the beginning and end of each work day. * Talk about the things your spouse wants to discuss and practice summarizing what they tell you. * When you’re in a store, look the people helping you in the eye. * Practice smiling at other people to foster positive emotional connections. * In your journal, note any petty annoyances that trigger you.The Extended Play version of this chapter includes: * Audio interview with psychiatrist Eric Leskowitz, M.D. * The seven steps of EcoMeditation * Emotional contagion videos * Additional case histories and referencesTo access the Extended Play version, visit: MindToMatter.club/Chapter3[https://mindtomatter.club/Chapter3/]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4 [content-toc.xhtml#t6]HOW ENERGY REGULATES DNA AND THE CELLS OF OUR BODIES [content-toc.xhtml#t6]You are not the same person you were a second ago, let alone yesterday. Yourbody is replacing cells and rejuvenating its systems at a frantic pace.Your body contains some 37 trillion cells (Bianconi et al., 2013). That’s a muchbigger number than the count of galaxies in the known universe. Old cells aredying and new ones replacing them all the time. Each second, over 810,000 cellsare being replaced.Your body produces one trillion new red blood cells per day (Wahlestedt et al.,2017). That’s a big number; with all its zeros it can be expressed as1,000,000,000,000.image [images/p135.jpg]Red blood cells circulating.As they circulate through your veins and arteries, red blood cells carry oxygenand nutrients to every other cell in your body. Each blood cell has a lifetimeof about four months, after which the liver extracts its vital ingredients andsends the rest to the spleen for recycling. You don’t have a single red bloodcell in your body that you had six months ago. Every one has been replaced.YOUR BODY IS CONSTANTLY REGENERATING ITSELFThe lining of your digestive tract also undergoes rapid turnover. It’s replacedevery four days. Your lung tissue? Every eight days. Even the densest oftissues, your bones, are constantly regenerating, with 10 percent of yourskeleton being replaced each year.There are about 84 billion neurons in the brain, along with a similar number ofnon-neural cells (Azevedo et al., 2009). Our brains are growing new neural cellscontinuously, and each cell can connect with thousands of others, weaving aninterconnected web of an estimated 150 trillion synapses (Sukel, 2011). Ourbrains are replacing at least one neuron per second (Walløe, Pakkenberg, &Fabricius, 2014).The hippocampus is the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning.It’s constantly adding new neurons and synapses while pruning others. Someneural pathways are shrinking, and the volume of those parts of the hippocampusdiminishes. Other neural pathways are growing, with their volume expanding.When a patient has a liver transplant, half the liver of the donor is typicallyremoved and transplanted into the body of the new host.

Thistable shows the renewal rates of some of these. The acronym BNID refers to theHarvard University Database of Useful Biological Numbers.Even the heart regenerates. Until very recently, scientists believed that theheart does not regenerate and that once heart cells have died, they are notreplaced. But recent research shows that heart tissue contains regions of stemcells that are available to replace damaged or dead cells and that the entireheart regenerates at least three times in the course of a person’s life(Laflamme & Murry, 2011).The corneal cells on the surface of your eye can regenerate within 24 hours.Your skin is being entirely replaced every month. The lining of your stomach isrenewing itself every week and your colon even faster. The self you wereyesterday is not the self you are today.image [images/p138.jpg]Cell division.Welcome to the new you!This continual turnover of the fundamental building blocks of our bodies hasprofound implications for how quickly and completely we can heal.Our bodies are programmed to heal. Healing is not something we get from aprescription, a doctor, an herb, or an alternative therapist. Healing is whatour bodies do naturally and normally every second of every day. The deeper ourunderstanding of the healing process, the better equipped we are to turn mind tomatter.YOUR BODY USES THE MATERIAL YOU MAKE AVAILABLE TO ITWhen you look in the mirror each morning, you might believe you’re seeingyesterday’s face staring back at you. But during the previous day, your bodyreplaced some 60 billion cells. You’re a different physical being than you werethe day before.This extensive daily remodeling of the body isn’t happening in a vacuum. You areshaping the quality of cells your body produces with material inputs such as thefood you eat and the water you drink. When you eat high-quality food, your bodyhas the raw materials with which to create high-quality proteins, the molecularbuilding blocks of cells.When you eat low-quality food, the body only has substandard materials out ofwhich to fashion new proteins. When your food lacks vital nutrients, your bodyis forced to make compromises, and those tradeoffs can eventually damage yourhealth.image [images/p139.jpg]Most of us know to choose healthy food and not eat junk, yet we’re often muchless discriminating about the energy we absorb.Think of your body as a factory and the cells it produces as cars. If the fineststeel is being delivered to its loading docks by freight companies, and it hasexcellent glass, flexible rubber, and advanced composites at its disposal, thefactory can build high-quality cars.But if the rubber is brittle or the glass opaque or the steel weak, the finalproduct is compromised. The factory can’t build excellent cars out of shoddyingredients. If the matter going in is inadequate, the matter emerging from yourbody’s manufacturing cycle will be of poor quality. Garbage in, garbage out.That’s the matter end of the equation. What about energy?CELLS REGENERATE IN A FIELDCells also replicate in an energy environment. Just as poor-quality matter isgoing to produce poor-quality cells, inferior energy is going to result ininferior molecules. Energy fields bathe our bodies, and the type of energy inwhich cell regeneration takes place determines the biological outcome.Right now, I’m enjoying a delicious cup of Earl Grey tea. I went to the kitchen,popped a tea bag into a cup, filled the cup with the tangy water from my well,and put the cup inside the microwave. I set the timer for two minutes,sufficient to bring the water to a boil.Though they’re invisible, the waves inside the microwave oven caused the waterin my teacup to change state. In two minutes, the water went from a roomtemperature of 70°F to boiling, 212°F. Matter was changed by energy.In the same way, our cells are bathed in the surrounding energy fields. Thesefields change the matter of our cells, even though they’re invisible. Strongradiation, such as that released in nuclear reactor disasters, can cause cellsto mutate.What happens when your cells are bathed in the energy of love, appreciation, andkindness created by a vibrant and coherent brain? Just the opposite. They’renurtured in the radiant fields of positive emotion.Here is one of my favorite healing stories. Glenda Payne faced a truly desperatesituation as her body began to degenerate. How she used her mind to save herselfhas inspired thousands of people.FROM TERMINAL MUSCULAR DEGENERATION TO DANCING AROUND THE ROOMBy Glenda PayneI had a job I loved. I was the wholesale program manager for a greenhousemanufacturing company. I was just expanding our market into France when I beganto notice strange symptoms. Climbing the stairs was becoming more and more of astruggle. I would feel as though I had just run a mile up a steep hill. My thighmuscles would hardly lift my legs. By the time I reached the top stair, I wouldbe gasping for breath.Despite taking time off to rest, I found that the muscle pain and weaknessescalated, with a frightening new symptom: terrible shortness of breath leadingto blackouts. Simple activities such as hand-washing dishes, standing in line ata public counter, or pushing a grocery cart would leave me in an embarrassedheap on the floor, desperately gasping for breath and fighting blackout. Oneafternoon, I was standing in the office talking with a co-worker and Ihelplessly slid to the floor, lost in a black tunnel. After that, I could nolonger drive. I never went back to work again.My doctors could find no explanation. After five years of expensive tests, goingto specialist after specialist, I finally got a diagnosis: a rare conditioncalled mitochondrial inclusion body myositis. I was told there was nothing theycould do for me.My life spiraled down into one of hopeless despair. I was ready to give up. Myworld was reduced to my living room couch or my bed.One spring, my sister shared a five-minute video demonstration of EFT tapping.We became hooked on tapping. That summer, we heard Dawson Church interview Dr.Joe Dispenza in a webinar.In the interview, Dr. Dispenza related his own medical miracle story. He hadbeen a professional bicycle racer. During an event, he was directly hit by alarge truck as he was navigating a turn. His injuries were serious, with littlehope that he would recover enough to walk again. He shared how he used his mindto communicate to the nerves and cells of his body while he was strapped to abed, utterly motionless. He projected an image of his healthy body into what hecalled the unified field of consciousness. It worked.As I lay there in my constant state of painful, exhausted fatigue, I latchedonto the hope that if he could find full recovery, I could too!Dawson worked with me on a live call during that same webinar. Hearing Dr.Dispenza’s story and tapping with Dawson for a few minutes on that call changedmy life. My sister and I both knew that tapping was helping us clear majorissues we’d been plagued with our whole lives. We chose to pursue certification.In October, we enrolled in our first certification class with Dawson. He workedwith me again in a demonstration. At the end of the four-day workshop, Iapproached Dawson with the words, “Notice what’s missing?” I dropped my cane andproceeded to dance in front of the whole room. I had arrived at the hotel forthat workshop in a wheelchair. I left dancing. I haven’t used my scooter sincethat day.In the three years since I first listened to that interview with Joe and Dawson,I’ve completed my EFT practitioner certification program, simultaneouslycompleted energy psychology certification, written and published a book, andcompleted an initiation as a shaman. I’m currently working on material for asecond book and a blog.I still have good days and bad days. I still need lots of rest. My cane is stillmy companion on most outings, though I find I am using it less and less. I amable to go on hikes again, though they are brief, of short distance, and must beon level ground. Inclines can still do me in. And I have to plan at least onefull day of rest after. I’ve learned to listen to my body.image [images/p142.jpg]Glenda four years later.The happier I get using all of the tools now available to me, the happier mybody is too, and the more activity I can handle. I have turned what was once ahopeless existence full of lonely despair into a life of joyful inspiration. Ienjoy whatever life chooses to offer me in each moment.I have a limited, part-time practice, but the people I work with provide theimpetus to continue being kind to my body. A well-rested me can be moreavailable to my clients and my readers. I love this work! I hope that one day mystory will prove to be as life-changing and inspirational to them as hearing Dr.Joe’s story was to me.WHEN SERIOUS DISEASES SIMPLY DISAPPEARI believe that many cases of remission from serious diseases are influenced bymental fields. The bodies of these people are being bathed in positivity whilethe cells are replicating and growing. When every one of those 810,000 new cellsthat your body creates each second is born in an energetic environment ofkindness and love, it shapes their development.image [images/p143.jpg]When we create mental, emotional, and spiritual fields of love and kindness, weprovide a healthy energetic ecosystem in which our bodies regenerate.The spontaneous remission of cancer without treatment has historically beenviewed by the medical profession as a rare phenomenon. One of the first authorsto make an estimate stated that it probably happened in 1 out of every 80,000cases (Boyd, 1966). A contemporary estimate was 1 in 100,000 cases (Boyers,1953).Modern studies, however, are discovering that remission is common. One foundthat about a fifth of breast cancers are healed by mind and body without theneed for medical intervention (Zahl, Mæhlen, & Welch, 2008). Others report asimilar percentage of patients healing spontaneously from a type of cancer thataffects white blood cells (Krikorian, Portlock, Cooney, & Rosenberg, 1980). Abibliography of medical reports of spontaneous remission found over 3,000 casesreported in the medical literature (O’Regan & Hirshberg, 1993).The spread of cancer requires signaling and cooperation between groups of cancercells. This signaling is triggered by stress (Wu, Pastor-Pareja, & Xu, 2010).Adrenaline, also called epinephrine, is one of our two main stress hormones, theother being cortisol. High levels of adrenaline trigger the spread of ovariancancer cells far away from the primary tumor. They also activate an enzymecalled FAK that inhibits the destruction of cancer cells and hastens death (Soodet al., 2010). A different enzyme, one that destroys prostate and breast cancercells, is immobilized by adrenaline (Sastry et al., 2007).When we lower our stress levels, we reverse these effects, sometimes quickly.Researchers report tumors shrinking to less than half their original size withina few hours of an emotional healing session (Ventegodt, Morad, Hyam, & Merrick,2004). Among those who experience spontaneous remission or survive much longerthan usual after a diagnosis, a change in worldview is common. They become morealtruistic in their relationships with others and actively involve themselves intheir treatment (Frenkel et al., 2011). Anandamide, the “bliss molecule”generated by meditation, also inhibits the formation of cancer cells. As mindchanges, so does matter.image [images/p144.jpg]Altruism and connection with others are hallmarks of those who heal.THE SHRINKING TUMORSEnergy healing researcher Bill Bengston, whom you read about in a previouschapter, was the subject of several randomized controlled trials in which he andhis graduate students were consistently able to heal cancerous tumors in mice.He then began to apply his method to people. The following story is an exampleof the healing that can occur when cells are bathed in positive energy fields(Bengston, 2010).One of Bill’s students, Laurie, was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer. Ithad spread first to her lymph nodes and then metastasized throughout her body.She was given four months to live. Bill recounts:“Against all advice, she opted to be treated by me. . . . For two months Itreated Laurie six days a week, sometimes many hours a day. So intense was theprocess that I developed alarming lumps in my own armpits and groin, whichdisappeared when I physically disconnected from her.“The usual medical tests administered by her doctors, including X-rays, bloodwork, and CAT scans, showed her tumors to be shrinking. Eventually, theydisappeared. . . . Laurie and I celebrated the fifth and tenth anniversary ofher remaining cancer-free.”The invisible microwaves of kindness might be bathing the regenerating cells ofthe bodies of people like Laurie to produce healing. When those 810,000 cellsthat are being created by our bodies every second are marinating in the energyof positive emotion, they’re being shaped by the field.When our consciousness shifts, and we begin to make deliberate changes, asGlenda and Laurie did, we change the character of the energy in which our newcells are being formed. Maintain those positive mental states for a few weeksand trillions of new cells have now been shaped by them.Let’s now look at the direct evidence for the influence of human-generatedenergy on cell formation.ENERGY GUIDES CELL FORMATIONAs researchers have exposed cell cultures to ranges of frequencies, they haveshown that some are particularly beneficial to the growth of certain types ofcells. Some of the frequencies that stimulate the growth of healthy cells arethe very frequencies generated by our brains. The electromagnetic fields of ourbrains, generated by our consciousness, may produce direct effects on cellularregeneration.Most of the signals to which our cells are most sensitive are at the very lowerend of the frequency spectrum. These microcurrents aren’t involved in carryingenergy. Instead, they carry information (Foletti, Ledda, D’Emilia, Grimaldi, &Lisi, 2011).Cells are typically sensitive to very narrow frequency bands. These are calledfrequency windows because cells will respond to frequencies in these narrowranges but not to those above or below that range.image [images/p146.jpg]Frequency windows are the narrow bands of energy to which particular cellsrespond.A review of 175 papers published in the scientific literature from 1950 to 2015found that certain frequencies triggered cell regeneration and repair. In thewords of the authors, “Waves affect cells . . . only at specific frequencies,being separated by wide ranges of non-effective frequencies” (Geesink & Meijer,2016, p. 110). These frequencies are similar to a musical scale, with harmonicresonance between frequencies on the scale, just as there are in a pleasingchord played on the piano. The authors listed the physical effects that variousfrequencies exert: * Stimulate the formation of nerve cells and synapses * Repair spinal cord tissue * Reduce the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease * Inhibit the growth of cancer cells * Improve memory * Synchronize the firing of neurons in different parts of the brain * Increase attention * Speed wound healing * Decrease the activity of inflammatory cells * Increase bone regeneration * Reduce the degeneration of nerves in diabetics * Trigger the expression of beneficial genes * Promote the growth of connective tissue like ligaments and tendons * Increase the amount of stem cells circulating in the body * Stimulate stem cells to differentiate into muscle, bone, and skin * Enhance the activity of white blood cells in the immune system * Catalyze the synthesis of growth hormone * Regulate free radicals (oxygen atoms regarded as the primary cause of aging) * Repair heart muscle by inducing cells to assemble and graft onto damaged tissueBIOMARKERS AS INDICATORS OF HEALTHAs we look at the fascinating research showing the effect of energy fields oncells, you’ll be captivated by the healing potential of this work. You’ll seethe possibility of radically improving your health and that of the people aroundyou.You’ll also notice that there are several common biological markers thatscientists examine. These include gene expression, growth hormone (GH) levels,aging markers called telomeres, and numbers of circulating stem cells. Thereason researchers use these biomarkers is that they correlate with theactivation of our immune and inflammation systems.Healthy activities reduce inflammation and boost immunity. The goal for healthis to have a highly functional immune system and as little systemic inflammationin the body as possible.Stem cells are “blank” cells that can turn into any other type of cell. Theycirculate through the body, and when we need to repair skin cells from a cut onour finger or lung tissue damaged by smoke, stem cells turn themselves intowhatever specific type of cell is required. They can change into bone cells,muscle cells, lung cells, or skin cells, depending on the body’s needs. Theirversatility makes stem cells extremely important to healing, and researchers usea count of their numbers as a proxy for how effectively an immune system isfunctioning.image [images/p148.jpg]Stem cells are “blank” cells that can turn into any other type of cell asrequired by the body.Another common substance of interest is growth hormone, or GH. Though the wordgrowth is in its name, that doesn’t mean it makes us grow larger. GH repairs andregenerates our cells. When we sleep, we typically produce more GH as our bodiesrepair the tissues damaged by the day’s activities. To keep our bodies young,healthy, and strong, we need high levels of GH. Patients whose vitality isdepleted often have low levels of GH. So if a treatment produces a higherconcentration of GH, it’s beneficial to our system.Oxidative stress is another common focus of research. Though the type of oxygenwe breathe in the air is stable, that’s because it is composed of two oxygenatoms bonded together (O2). However, single oxygen atoms, unpaired with a secondatom, damage our cells. They’re called free radicals. Oxidative stress, theproduct of free radicals, is regarded as the most universal cause of aging.Another much-studied molecule is telomerase. Telomeres are the endcaps of thechromosomes in our cells, and they shorten slightly every time a cell divides.Telomerase is an enzyme that adds DNA molecules to the ends of telomeres. As wegrow older, the chains of DNA in the telomeres on the ends of our chromosomesdecline at a rate of about one percent a year. This makes telomere length anextremely stable marker of biological aging.image [images/p149.jpg]The bright spots at the ends of the chromosomes are telomeres.When people are stressed, their cells die more quickly because of the wear andtear on their molecules. To replace the cells killed by stress, the body’s cellshave to divide more often to make replacements. As cells divide more frequently,their telomeres shorten more quickly. Stressed people lose telomere length fast,while healthy people have long telomeres. This is one reason why stressed peopledie at younger ages than those who know how to relax. Scientists can tell ourbiological age from the length of our telomeres, making this a popular genetictest.BRAIN WAVES AS WINDOWS TO THE MINDThere are thousands of studies showing the energy field frequency windows thataffect cells and molecules. What I’m particularly interested in is thefrequencies generated by our own brain waves, especially delta, theta, alpha,and gamma. That’s because these are naturally occurring frequencies in ourbodies. As our brain frequencies change, they affect our cells. I’m fascinatedby how we can change our cellular environment using our own naturally generatedbrain waves.When in my trainings I teach people to meditate and tap, their levels of thesefour brain waves increase. They are frequencies you can induce yourself—nomedications, herbs, beliefs, or mind-altering substances required!A century of study has demonstrated that our brains produce the energy fields wemeasure as brain waves. It’s also shown that mental states such as the ones wegenerate during meditation and tapping produce unique energy fields. Very slowwaves like delta, theta, and alpha, as well as very fast waves like gamma,change dramatically when we induce these states of mind. As we examine theresearch associated with each of the five brain wave frequencies, from slowestto fastest, you’ll notice an exciting range of healing events associated witheach.image [images/p150.jpg]A conference participant hooked up to an EEG during a live therapy session. Theentire audience can see her brain waves.DeltaThe slowest brain wave, delta, from 0 to 4 Hz, is associated with manybeneficial changes in living tissues. Key studies of normal brains have pointedto some of the links between healing and frequencies in the 0–4 Hz range.A group of sleep investigators hooked men up to EEG monitors before they went tobed in order to study sleep patterns (Gronfier et al., 1996). In addition to theEEG readings, growth hormone levels were measured every 10 minutes. Theresearchers found that when delta waves were at their peak in the brain, thesecretion levels of GH were highest.In a different group of men of a wide range of ages, from teenagers tooctogenarians, an association was found between delta and GH production (VanCauter, Leproult, & Plat, 2000). Production of both of these declinedprogressively, the older the men were. GH is synthesized during periods of deltawave sleep.Ahmed and Wieraszko (2008) took slices of live tissue from the hippocampus, thepart of the brain that governs memory and learning. They found that a very lowfrequency in the delta band, 0.16 Hz, increases activity in the synapticconnections between neurons in the hippocampus. This suggests that memory andlearning may be enhanced by delta activity.Researchers from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis,Missouri, looked at beta-amyloids, sticky plaques between neurons in the braincharacteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (Kang et al., 2009). They found thatduring sleep, when brains are primarily in theta and delta brain wave states,beta-amyloid production in the brain ceases, and toxic material is cleared away.The effect was greater in deep sleep, the phase of sleep in which our brains arein delta.When analyzing RNA and five proteins that are involved in the production oftelomerase, a group of researchers found peak resonance in these molecules inthe frequency bands of 0.19 and 0.37 Hz (Cosic, Cosic, & Lazar, 2015). What isstriking about this study is that other frequencies did not affect telomerase.The molecule was exquisitely sensitive to just a tiny frequency window withindelta.image [images/p151.jpg]The resonant peaks for 10 telomere sequences clustered around a frequency windowof 0.19 Hz.A research team inspired by the work of Marko Markoff, who has published morethan 100 scientific reports on biological electromagnetism, found that deltafrequencies between 0.5 Hz and 3 Hz stimulate the regeneration of nerve cells(Sisken, Midkiff, Tweheus, & Markov, 2007).Delta is the wave that we see in EEG readouts when people are having a sense ofconnection with the infinite. They typically report mystical experiences inwhich the local self merges with the nonlocal self. Meditators with largeamplitudes of delta feel connected to all of nature, to other human beings, andto the infinite. They lose the sense of being an isolated individual, or whatAlbert Einstein called the delusion of separateness. Instead, they experienceoneness with all that is.When our brains are producing delta, we are bathing our cells in a frequencythat has the potential to produce a whole gamut of beneficial physiologicalchanges at the level of our cells, from growing our telomeres and boosting ourGH levels to regenerating our neurons and sweeping our brains clear ofbeta-amyloid plaques. We are not just having a nice subjective experience; inthe delta state, we are creating an objective energy environment in which ourbodies thrive.image [images/p152.jpg]People who are in transcendent states, experiencing oneness with nonlocal mind,show large amplitudes of delta brain waves.ThetaTheta is the second slowest brain wave, with oscillations ranging from 4 to 8Hz. It’s the frequency most commonly observed in healers. Becker (1990) foundthat when healers were in the midst of an energy healing session, theta was themost common wave in their brains. Before starting the healing session, theymight have had high beta or delta or other brain wave patterns indicative ofordinary consciousness, but once they placed their hands on or near a sickperson and began the healing encounter, they reverted to theta.This was true regardless of which healing school they belonged to or what set ofbeliefs they held. Some were qigong masters. Others were Native Americanshamans. Some were kabbalistic practitioners. Still others were Christian faithhealers. Regardless of affiliation, their brains went into theta when theyimmersed themselves in the healing state (Kelly, 2011).image [images/p153.jpg]Healing session.Theta is associated with many beneficial changes in the body. A group ofresearchers studied the effect of various frequencies on DNA repair. They foundthat electromagnetic fields between 7.5 Hz and 30 Hz were able to enhancemolecular bonding (Tekutskaya, Barishev, & Ilchenko, 2015). Within that range, 9Hz proved most effective.There are many studies of human and animal cartilage cells, because repair ofthese cells is essential to wellness, as anyone who has had a sprained ankle ora pulled ligament can attest. A research group using pulsing electromagnetsfound that human cartilage cells are regenerated by the frequency of 6.4 Hz,right in the middle of the theta band (Sakai, Suzuki, Nakamura, Norimura, &Tsuchiya, 1991). This frequency also increases the activity of antioxidants, themolecules that neutralize the free radicals regarded as the most common cause ofaging.A research group at the Toho University School of Medicine in Japan looked atthe EEG signatures of subjects practicing deep abdominal breathing. They foundthat their levels of the “feel-good” neurotransmitter serotonin rose, and thetaas well as alpha and delta waves increased (Fumoto, Sato-Suzuki, Seki, Mohri, &Arita, 2004). Another study found that frequencies alternating between 5 Hz and10 Hz produced a large reduction in lower back pain in 17 patients (Lee et al.,2006).A pair of Russian scientists examined the effect of frequencies between 5.5 Hzand 16.5 Hz on DNA in a water solution. They found that the molecules were mosthighly stimulated at 9 Hz and that the effect was more than twice as great as itwas on the untreated control molecules (Tekutskaya & Barishev, 2013).AlphaIf you’ve undergone neurofeedback or biofeedback training, you’ve heard a lotabout alpha. These trainings are designed to educate you to induce an alphabrain wave state at will. Alpha oscillates at 8 to 13 Hz.Alpha is right in the middle of the frequency bands, between beta and gammaabove and theta and delta below. Legendary brain pioneer Maxwell Cade believedthat alpha serves as a bridge between the upper and lower frequencies. Betareflects the activity of the conscious mind, while theta and delta represent thesubconscious and unconscious minds. Cade believed that the alpha bridge connectsthe conscious mind with both the intuitive wisdom of the unconscious and thenonlocal resource of the universal field. A truly integrated person is able togenerate large amplitudes of alpha.It turns out that alpha also does good things for our bodies. It improves ourlevels of mood-enhancing neurotransmitters such as serotonin. When the alphabrain wave level increased in a group of exercisers, they gained a boost inserotonin, and their emotional state was elevated (Fumoto et al., 2010). Inanother study, Zen meditators received the same benefits from cultivating analpha state (Yu et al., 2011).image [images/p155.jpg]Meditation produces beneficial changes in brain waves. The “alpha bridge” is thekey to connecting our conscious minds with our unconscious resources.A pioneering study exposed DNA to various frequencies. It found that the alphafrequency of 10 Hz resulted in significantly increased synthesis of the DNAmolecule (Takahashi, Kaneko, Date, & Fukada, 1986).Neurons in the brain’s hippocampus also fire in this range (4–12 Hz), and at 10Hz and higher frequencies, the synapses in the learning and memory circuits ofthe brain are enhanced (Tang et al., 1999). Other regions of the brain also usethe 8–10 Hz band to communicate, with their neurons oscillating at thosefrequencies (Destexhe, McCormick, & Sejnowski, 1993).Alpha, therefore, tunes the brain to peak performance, as well as facilitatinggene expression and improving mood. The expansive emotional feelings reported bymeditators after their regular sessions aren’t simply subjectiveself-assessments. They are objective biological facts that can be measured inDNA, neurotransmitters, and brain waves.BetaBeta waves range from 13 to 25 Hz. There are two types of beta, and many modernresearchers split beta into two different types of wave. Low beta, from 13 to 15Hz, is also called SMR, which is short for sensorimotor rhythm. It’s associatedwith the body’s housekeeping functions.High beta ranges from 15 to 25 Hz. It’s always present in the thinking brain butincreases when we focus on a task. Look up the route to a destination on yoursmartphone, write a blog post, take a language class, or cook with a complicatedrecipe, and your brain’s amplitude of high beta increases.Stress results in abnormally large amplitudes of high beta. When you’re arguingwith a friend, under an impossible deadline at work, hearing scary sounds in adark house at night, remembering a childhood trauma, or thinking negativethoughts, your brain kicks into high beta. It’s the signature brain wave ofstress. It’s associated with a rise in cortisol and adrenaline and a largenumber of adverse reactions in your body. Fear and anxiety produce high beta,and it inhibits many beneficial cellular functions. Your body ages much fasterwhen your brain is bathed in high beta waves.GammaGamma is the most recently discovered brain wave. It is associated with theintegration of information from all of the brain’s regions, as well as withcoherence as they all synchronize (Gray, 1997). Imagine having a flash ofinsight about a problem that has been bothering you for weeks. Imagine thesatisfaction of doing a difficult task perfectly. Think about the synchronizedbrain function of a child at play, an artist painting, or a composer writing amasterpiece. That’s gamma. It starts where beta leaves off, at 25 Hz, and goesup to 100 Hz and above.image [images/p156.jpg]Researchers build an extremely low-frequency electromagnetic field generatingsystem using a transformer, multimeter, solenoids coils, teslameter, and probe(Razavi, Salimi, Shahbazi-Gahrouei, Karbasi, & Kermani, 2014).A team led by Li-Huei Tsai of MIT tested the effect of gamma waves onAlzheimer’s disease. They had mice run a maze while they recorded the brainwaves in the hippocampus, which is responsible for navigation and memory. When amouse hit a dead end, its brain would display a sharp burst of gamma. The brainsof mice genetically engineered to be prone to Alzheimer’s didn’t react the sameway. They produced less gamma, with poor synchronization between groups ofneurons.The researchers then flashed light into the brains of the mice at a gammafrequency of 40 Hz. In just an hour, the levels of beta-amyloid decreased byhalf. “We were very, very surprised,” says Tsai (Iaccarino et al., 2016).Looking for a mechanism, she found that gamma had mobilized a class of braincells called microglia. These are the scavengers of the brain, gobbling upmalformed proteins and dead cells. After exposure to gamma, the size and numberof the microglia doubled as they began to scoop up the beta-amyloid plaques.Vikaas Sohal of the University of California says, “If gamma oscillations arepart of the software of the brain, this study suggests that running the softwarecan alter the hardware” (Yong, 2016).A pilot study that used light to stimulate the hippocampi of five patients withthe cognitive decline characteristic of Alzheimer’s found that their symptomsimproved (Saltmarche, Naeser, Ho, Hamblin, & Lim, 2017). Newer versions of thistechnology combine both 10 Hz (alpha) and 40 Hz (gamma) stimulation (Lim, 2014,2017).image [images/p157.jpg]Alzheimer’s disease produces plaques in the brain that impede neural signaling.Gamma is associated with many other beneficial changes in our bodies. Afrequency of 75 Hz is epigenetic, triggering the genes that produceanti-inflammatory proteins in the body (De Girolamo et al., 2013). On the lowerend of the gamma spectrum, a frequency of 50 Hz results in the body increasingits production of stem cells, the “blank” cells that differentiate into muscle,bone, skin, or whatever other specialized cells are required (Ardeshirylajimi &Soleimani, 2015). The frequency of 60 Hz regulates the expression of stressgenes, those that code for stress hormones like cortisol. The same frequencyalso activates a key gene called Myc that in turn regulates around 15 percent ofall the other genes in the body (Lin, Goodman, & Shirley‐Henderson, 1994).High beta, the signature brain wave of a stressed-out consciousness, actuallysuppresses DNA synthesis. When bone cells were exposed to a beta frequency of 25Hz, it inhibited their growth. Gamma frequencies of 75 Hz or more, however,increased their growth. A peak was reached at 125 Hz, with that frequencyproducing three times the growth rate of the beta frequency (Ying, Hong,Zhicheng, Xiauwei, & Guoping, 2000).The previous studies are suggestive rather than definitive, because in many ofthem, the frequencies were produced by external devices such as pulsedelectromagnetic field (PEMF) machines. Others, such as those linking brain wavesto cell changes, demonstrate association between the two phenomena rather thancausation.The big picture, however, is that our bodies are sensitive to the frequenciesgenerated by our brains, from the slowest waves of delta to the fastest waves ofgamma, and that by understanding these links, we can use our brain waves to healour cells.MIND CHANGE = FIELD CHANGE = CELL CHANGEThe sheer number and variety of cell changes associated with brain waves isremarkable. Armed with the knowledge that the brain waves we generate areproducing massive shifts in our body moment by moment, how can we nudge theprocess in the direction of optimal health?Studies show that many spiritual practices change brain waves. Mindfulnessproduces a host of beneficial changes in brain waves. A meta-analysis including56 papers and a total of 1,715 subjects found increased alpha and theta waves(Lomas, Ivtzan, & Fu, 2015). Other research shows that heart coherence producesalpha and gamma even while it calms the anxiety bands of beta (Kim, Rhee, &Kang, 2013). When you practice mindfulness meditation for just three months, youstart to grow your telomeres (Jacobs et al., 2011).Research I’ve done at Joe Dispenza’s advanced workshops shows that thousands ofpeople are routinely able to increase their levels of delta and gamma (Church,Yang, Fannin, & Blickheuser, 2016). I’ve hooked up meditators to EEG monitors atmy EcoMeditation workshops and observed increases in gamma, alpha, theta, anddelta brain waves while the monkey mind characteristics of beta disappear.EEG expert Laura Eichman talked about what she observed in one participant at aworkshop: “The changes I saw in Stephanie’s brain waves were typical of everyonewe measured. Ten minutes into the EcoMeditation exercise, people tune in totheir heart energy and send it out to connect with someone else. I saw a hugeincrease in Stephanie’s delta amplitude, and shortly after that, her gamma. Herhigher gamma frequency bands were riding on her low delta.“I had the screen readout on a standard 10-millivolt setting, which is fine tomeasure the usual brain activity. But Stephanie’s brain was producing so muchdelta that I had to adjust the window all the way out to 20 millivolts. Thatstill wasn’t enough, I had to go out progressively further, to 30 and then to 40millivolts to capture her brain activity.“This link between the high and low frequency bands—delta and gamma—is one we’veseen a few times in healers and psychics. Afterward, I asked Stephanie about herexperience. It matched her brain map. She reported an ‘inner knowing’ that shewas filled with light.”EcoMeditation combines tapping, mindfulness, heart coherence, and neurofeedbackin a simple yet elegant package that integrates the benefits of all thosemethods. All of these are ways we can shift the energy fields in which our cellsare reproducing.image [images/p159.jpg]The magic pill to increase well-being and happiness.If I offered you a pill that could increase your levels of circulating stemcells, lengthen your telomeres, dissipate beta-amyloid plaques in your brain,improve your memory and attention levels, boost your serotonin, repair your DNA,regulate inflammation, boost your immune system, repair your skin, bone,cartilage, and muscle cells, power up your GH levels for cell repair, andenhance the neural connections in your brain, how much would you pay for it?Though it’s priceless, it’s all free. EcoMeditation has been free on theInternet for over a decade. I’ve taught it to thousands of people all over theworld. It’s ironic that what might be the biggest medical breakthrough of ourgeneration is freely available to everyone, from the poorest to the richest.All of the beneficial brain wave states are available to us by simply touchingour screens and following simple instructions. As we make this choice, ourfields change, and the 810,000 cells that our bodies are creating each secondare bathed in the health-promoting waves coming from our very own brains.YOUR IDEAL BRAIN WAVE RECIPEThere are an infinite number of possible brain wave states. There is a brainwave state that you are accustomed to being in every day. It is the one yourregular mental function produces. That’s the way your very own personal brainprocesses information. It feels familiar to you, because you have a set rangefor the amplitude of each wave in which your brain normally functions. You areaccustomed to a certain amplitude of beta relative to theta, alpha, and delta.Your personal brain wave ratio is like a recipe. Your habitual mix is like thefood you eat most frequently. You are familiar with the smell, taste, andtexture of the dish, and you hardly notice you are eating it.A peak state is different. It’s like a gourmet meal with exquisite brain wavesas the ingredients. Add more delta, and you feel one with the universe. Add moretheta, and you experience a wave of healing. Increase the amplitude of alpha,and your conscious and subconscious minds start communicating with one another.Perhaps your personal everyday recipe (expressed in µV, or microvolts) is this: * Beta: 20 * Alpha: 25 * Theta: 30 * Delta: 100That’s a fairly normal set of numbers. There’s nothing wrong with it, and mostpeople’s brains are somewhere in that range every day.When you have a peak experience, the numbers change. The recipe your brainexperiences when you enter an elevated state is different. Alpha swells fromyour usual 25 to 60 µV. Worry-driven beta shrinks from 20 µVto 5. Theta anddelta balloon to 50 µV and 200 µV respectively. You have a profound innerexperience of connection with the infinite field and feel one with all beings.This might be triggered by an experience such as: * The first day of spring * An inspirational movie * Your favorite song * A baby grasping your finger * A foot massage * A tender moment with a friend * An inspirational talk * Running a mile * Receiving applause after a speech * The perfect cup of coffee * A new book from your favorite author * Completing a long-overdue task * Contemplating open space after throwing out clutter * A smile from a stranger * Dunking a basketball in the hoop * Witnessing the birth of a puppy * A perfect sunset * Falling in love * A walk on the beachBy accident, triggered by an external stimulus, you’ve experienced a new brainwave recipe, and it feels great. If at that moment of peak experience, I had youhooked up to an EEG, your brain wave recipe might look like this: * Beta: 5 * Alpha: 60 * Theta: 50 * Delta: 200Look at how different those numbers are from your everyday recipe. All thathigh-stress beta has disappeared. Your alpha has flared way up, as have thetaand delta. You have a completely different ratio of waves as your brainprocesses information in a new way.When we take a bite of a gourmet recipe, our palate is startled by how deliciousthe food is. We savor each mouthful. The recipe is unfamiliar and exotic. In thesame way, the ratio of brain waves we experience during a peak state is one thatis not familiar to us. It’s special.We might call it being in the zone or a transcendent state, or on a high or inan altered state, or channeling a discarnate being, or falling in love, orhaving a visitation by an angel, or feeling euphoric, or touching heaven, orliving a magic moment, or having a peak experience, or seeing a spirit guide.Whatever label we give it, we recognize this novel experience as being special.We’re sampling a recipe that is much more delicious than our normal fare. Itdoesn’t feel like us, which is why we might think it’s a divine visitation or apersonality separate from our own.Yet it’s your brain that has created this recipe, even if only for a moment. Thebrain that creates that particular ratio of brain wave ingredients is able tocreate it again. It can be trained to do so at will.image [images/p163.jpg]The habitual brain wave recipe of this workshop participant had lots offear-induced beta, little theta and delta, and only a small alpha bridge.image [images/p163-1.jpg]After treatment, we see large flares forming an alpha bridge, expanded theta anddelta, and a disappearance of high amplitudes of beta.When we first hook people up to EEGs during our workshops, we see thecombinations of brain waves that represent their personal recipes. Often theyare stressed and anxious, with a lot of high-frequency beta waves. They havelittle alpha, theta, or delta. To them, this state of being cut off from theirunconscious and the universe, without an alpha bridge, is normal.After treatment, the entire way their brains process information changes.They’ve sampled a new recipe and they like it. They have a big alpha bridgeconnecting their conscious and subconscious minds. They’re in touch with thehealing frequency of theta and the transcendent frequency of delta.If we can persuade them to make this a consistent practice, with their brainsenjoying the delicious new brain wave recipe every day, they become habituatedto feeling good. It becomes the new normal. In time, their set point changes,and the gourmet recipe becomes their staple. Their bodies are bathed in thefields of healing every day.Here is one example of a workshop participant who experienced a breakthroughwhen his brain flipped into this elevated state.HEARING THE WAVES BREAKING ON THE DISTANT SHOREHarold was in the middle of a profound crisis. A top official at the UnitedNations, he’d blacked out and fallen to the ground in the middle of a hostagenegotiation three months before. His doctors told him he was stressed, and whilethey could find nothing wrong with his 52-year-old body, they advised him torelax and learn meditation. He’d made a complete recovery except for hishearing, which he had lost when he blacked out. Tests showed that he’d lost 80percent of the hearing in his left ear.He decided to enroll in a weeklong training I was offering at Esalen Institutein Big Sur, California. He had been visiting Esalen for various classes for 15years, and the combination of massage, hot tubs, homegrown food, and oceansideviews usually rejuvenated him.When I met him, I was awed by his intelligence, humor, and expansive worldview.He had a satisfying long-term marriage, a successful son, a best-selling book,professional kudos, and every material benefit. Yet he was haunted by a gnawingsense that he’d made a wrong turn somewhere in his life. He wanted coaching tohelp him decide whether to take early retirement from his stressful job and todevelop a robust health plan.To help create the changes he envisioned, Harold volunteered to be my subjectfor a coaching demonstration in front of the whole group.Before the training began, we used a panel of tests to assess the well-being ofthe people in the group. These tests included psychological evaluations ofdepression, anxiety, pain, happiness, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).We also measured Harold’s physiological profile. The panel of tests includedcortisol (the main stress hormone), salivary immunoglobulin A (SIgA, a primarymarker of immune function), and resting heart rate. We hooked Harold up to anEEG during his session so we could monitor his brain waves.Working with me in front of the whole group, Harold described his fears ofgrowing older, of getting sicker, of becoming irrelevant. He recounted howshocked he felt when he abruptly lost consciousness during the hostagenegotiation: “Suddenly, I hit the floor.” While he was reconciled to the loss ofhearing he’d suffered, he worried that it was the start of a progressivephysical decline.As I worked with him, Harold began to relax and tune in to his emotions. Hisbreathing slowed and his muscles relaxed. His EEG readings showed flares oftheta and delta waves, expanded alpha frequencies, and a reduction in beta.These were all indications that he was getting out of his anxious “monkey mind”and back in tune with his intuition and his bodily sensations. As his mindchanged, his brain functions shifted.We worked through a succession of his fears and disappointments and identifiedgoals that he might achieve if he combined relaxation with creativity. Energypsychology helped him resolve all the jagged emotions left over from his healthcrisis, while coaching psychology clarified the opportunities before him and thefresh goals he could set for himself.Eventually, I asked him, “How is that 80 percent hearing loss in your left ear?”He looked surprised, and said, “It’s almost gone . . . maybe 15 percent lossnow.”“How do you know it’s an 80 percent hearing loss?” I wondered.“The doctor told me,” he affirmed. “It’s a medical diagnosis.”“Let’s work on that belief,” I suggested.We then focused on beliefs like It’s a medical diagnosis and The doctor said it,so it must be true.After coaching him through a process that questioned those beliefs, I asked himagain about his left ear. He closed his eyes, focused intently on his hearing.Suddenly, his eyes popped wide open. Almost shouting, he exclaimed, “I can hearthe waves breaking on the shore! I’ve been coming to Esalen for 15 years, andI’ve never been able to hear the ocean. Now I can!”PRACTICE HABITUATES THE BRAIN TO BALANCEDuring my EcoMeditation retreats, on the first morning, we teach people toattain these peak states. It isn’t hard if you have the right combination ofsignals to the body. At first, it takes about four minutes to drop into therecipe. By the afternoon session, participants can do it in 90 seconds.They feel wonderful and think they’ve arrived in heaven every time they closetheir eyes and start meditating. Yet that brain wave state is just thebeginning. We then train them to evoke the magic recipe with their eyes open, atfirst in the meditation room. Once they become stable in the EcoMeditation statein that safe location, we start sending them into the environment outside.They walk along the footpaths or through the gardens, learning to maintain thatstate. They come back into the meditation room and close their eyes again,increasing their amplitude of alpha. We then have them go outside again. Wealternate inside and outside, eyes open and eyes closed, over and over again.After the third day, they are usually able to maintain their new state with eyesopen outside the room. At that stage, we’ve begun to change their set point andinstall a new normal. A doctor named Susan Albers describes it this way: “Themorning following the class was the first time I had ever successfullymeditated—in my entire life. All 52 years of it. I’m not someone who’s calm,ever. And I was. What a revelation!”Another participant, Maaike Linnenkamp, said: “EcoMeditation makes me calmer,more relaxed, and gives me a clearer mind. It was powerful for me to break theold thinking process and let go of the unpleasant memories that I usually dwellon. For the first time in my life, when I remembered bad events, I didn’t becomeanxious. I just could not believe it when I talked to a friend about it laterand still felt no anxiety. I feel very grateful and I will apply this techniqueon a regular basis.”image [images/p167.jpg]Participants at an EcoMeditation workshop at Esalen Institute in California.Susan, Maaike, and their friends have learned to take that gourmet brain waverecipe and turn it into their everyday brain food. They’ve trained their brainsto be able to cook that delicious meal consistently. Just as it is hard to goback to bad wine once you’ve experienced fine wine, or start wearing harshfabrics after you’ve enjoyed soft microfibers, or revert to your ancient cellphone after you’ve become used to the features of the latest model, it is hardto go back to the old normal recipe. Your previous brain state is the one thatnow feels foreign. You’ve upgraded your brain.COHERENT BRAIN STATES TRIGGER GENE EXPRESSIONI have served as the chief investigator in many studies showing the effects ofemotional healing on both physical and psychological symptoms. My latest workexamines the epigenetic effects of stress reduction. The number and importanceof the genes affected is astonishing.After the first groups of U.S. veterans began returning from Iraq andAfghanistan, therapists told me they were encountering many clients with PTSD.Linda Geronilla, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist at Marshall University’s medicalschool, shared with me that in just a few sessions of EFT tapping with veterans,PTSD symptoms such as nightmares, flashbacks, and hypervigilance were gone.Linda and I designed a study to determine if EFT was effective in treating PTSD.Our pilot study involved just seven veterans, but it was so successful that wewere able to achieve statistical significance (Church, Geronilla, & Dinter,2009). When you get statistical significance (which means that there is just onepossibility in 20 that the results are due to chance) in a very small sample, itmeans you have a very effective treatment.With a group of colleagues, I then launched a full-scale nationwide randomizedcontrolled trial. We compared veterans getting standard care for PTSD, usuallyat a VA hospital, with a second group getting standard care plus EFT.The study took several years to complete, but the results were the same. PTSDsymptoms dropped by over 60 percent (Church et al., 2013). Once the study waspublished, Linda conducted a replication study, with almost identical results(Geronilla, Minewiser, Mollon, McWilliams, & Clond, 2016).I wondered what was happening inside the bodies of these veterans, especially atthe level of the genome. In 2009, I initiated a study of gene expression inveterans receiving 10 sessions of EFT. It took six years to complete, buteventually it showed that six stress genes were being regulated. Inflammationwas being dialed down even while immunity was being dialed up (Church, Yount,Rachlin, Fox, & Nelms, 2016).EFT PRODUCES DRAMATIC GENE SHIFTSBeth Maharaj, an imaginative psychotherapist friend, designed a groundbreakingstudy for her doctoral dissertation. She had discovered a new type of gene test.While the earlier clinical trials required veterans to provide blood samples ata lab, the new test was saliva based. Participants had only to spit in a cup,and we could measure expression in hundreds or even thousands of genes.Beth gave four subjects an hour-long placebo session, followed a week later byan hour-long EFT therapy session, and compared saliva samples before and aftereach session. She found that EFT produced regulation of an astonishing 72 genes(Maharaj, 2016). The functions of those genes proved to be fascinating. Amongthem were: * The suppression of cancer tumors * Protection against the sun’s ultraviolet radiation * Type 2 diabetes insulin resistance * Immunity from opportunistic infections * Antiviral activity * Synaptic connectivity between neurons * Creation of both red and white blood cells * Enhancement of male fertility * Building white matter in the brain * Regulating metabolism * Increasing neural plasticity * Strengthening cell membranes * Reducing oxidative stressThese shifts in gene expression were substantial, and when Beth retestedparticipants a day later, about half of the effects persisted. That’s a bigpayoff for just one hour of therapy.MEDITATION REGULATES CANCER GENESInspired by Beth’s example, my friend Joe Dispenza decided to test participantsat one of his advanced workshops. I obtained saliva samples from 30 people, andwhen the results came back from the lab, we found that eight genes weresignificantly upregulated during the four days of meditation.With a research team, I examined the data from over 100 EEG scans from anotherof Joe’s workshops. We found that after practicing for four days, people entereda meditative state 18 percent faster and the ratio of anxiety-producing beta tointegrative delta had improved by 62 percent (Church, Yang, et al., 2016).As people’s brains were being regulated by Joe’s powerful meditation practices,their genes were also shifting. The functions of the eight genes we foundchanged tell a powerful story of physiological shift. They are involved inneurogenesis, the growth of new neurons in response to novel experiences andlearning. They are also implicated in protecting our body against the influencesthat age our cells.Several of these genes regulate cell repair, including the ability to move stemcells to the sites in the body where they can repair damaged or aging tissue.These genes are also involved in the building of cellular structures, especiallythe cytoskeleton, the framework of rigid molecules that gives our cells shapeand form.Three of these eight genes help our bodies identify and eliminate cancerouscells, suppressing the growth of cancer tumors. Their names and functions are asfollows:CHAC1 regulates the oxidative balance in cells. The hormone glutathione is keyto reducing free radicals, and CHAC1 helps control the levels of glutathione incells (Park, Grabińska, Guan, & Sessa, 2016). CHAC1 has several other functions.It also helps neural cells form and grow optimally (Cantagrel et al., 2010). Itis believed to assist with the proper formation of the protein molecules thatregulate oxidation and neuron formation.CTGF (connective tissue growth factor) plays an important role in manybiological processes (Hall-Glenn & Lyons, 2011). These range from the healing ofwounds to the development of bones to the regeneration of cartilage and otherconnective tissue. CTGF helps new replacement cells migrate to the sites ofwounding and damage in the body. It regulates the growth of new cells and thebinding of cells to each other during the healing process. Decreased expressionof this gene is linked to cancer and to autoimmune diseases such asfibromyalgia.TUFT1 has a variety of functions in cell repair and healing (Deutsch et al.,2002). It helps regulate the functioning of a class of stem cells. During achild’s development of teeth, TUFT1 acts to start the mineralization process ofenamel. It is also thought to be involved in regulating oxygen levels in cellsand in the differentiation of neurons.DIO2 is important to the function of many types of brain and endocrine tissue(Salvatore, Tu, Harney, & Larsen, 1996). As well as being prevalent in thyroidtissue, it is highly expressed in other tissues, synchronizing local cells withthyroid gland function. It helps regulate metabolism by reducing insulinresistance, which in turn reduces the risk of metabolic disease (Akarsu et al.,2016), while also playing a role in craving and addiction. It helps regulatemood, especially depression.C5orf66-AS1 is a gene associated with the suppression of tumors (Wei et al.,2015). It codes for a type of RNA that acts to identify and eliminate cancerouscells from the body.KRT24 codes for the synthesis of a protein molecule that gives cells theirstructure. It also helps these molecules organize themselves in regular arrays(Omary, Ku, Strnad, & Hanada, 2009) and suppresses certain types of cancer cellssuch as those involved in colorectal cancer (Hong, Ho, Eu, & Cheah, 2007).ALS2CL is one of a class of genes that suppress tumors, especially thosecontributing to a type of cancer called squamous cell carcinoma that affects thehead and neck (Lee et al., 2010).RND1 helps cells in the growth phase organize the molecules that give them theirrigid structure. RND1 also catalyzes the growth of the parts of neural cellsthat reach out to connect with other neurons. It suppresses certain types ofcancer cells such as those found in throat cancer and breast cancer (Xiang, Yi,Weiwei, & Weiming, 2016).New technologies are allowing us to peer into the nuclei of our cells and theinformation flow in our brains and find out what happens during EFT, meditation,and other stress-reduction practices. What we are discovering is that thechanges these techniques produce in the body are far from trivial. The pictureemerging is that changes of mind produce profound changes in the matter of whichour bodies are formed.Bryce Rogow is a former Marine medic who served in four combat deployments inIraq. He was there during some of the most bitter fighting and witnessed carnageand horror. After being discharged with PTSD, he set out on a quest forself-healing. Here’s his story.FROM A COMBAT ZONE TO INNER PEACEBy Bryce RogowA lot of my friends say I’m a walking contradiction: on one hand a spiritualseeker; I’ve studied meditation at a Zen monastery in Japan, am a yoga teacher,and I’ve been learning mind-body medicine from some of the top healers aroundthe world.On the other hand, I’m a veteran of four combat deployments to Iraq as acorpsman, or medic, with the U.S. Marines. After getting out of the military, Iwas diagnosed with PTSD, and after some time of feeling lost and hopeless, Iembarked on a journey of self-discovery and healing, intent on learning the mosteffective techniques for cooling the fires of mental and physical distress.My first deployment with a U.S. Marine recon battalion (the Marines’ version ofSpecial Forces) led me to the second battle of Fallujah in November 2004, amassive assault on a city that has been described as the most intense urbancombat U.S. forces have seen since Hue City in Vietnam.All of us who deployed carry with us images that stay with us for the rest ofour lives, images we have to learn how to live with.For me, the first image of that kind came after my first buddy in my unit waskilled while digging up an IED (improvised explosive device)—one of the homemadebombs insurgents would bury in fields and roadsides.My method for preserving my own mental function, in addition to becomingaddicted to the painkillers we medics had available, was to accept the fact thatI was already dead, and so I would constantly remind myself that nothing thathappened to me would matter, because I was already dead.When I received my honorable discharge from the U.S. military in 2008, I wassurprised to have survived the war. I expected a huge flood of relief when I wasreleased from any possibility of future deployments, but that relief never came.I walked and drove around U.S. cities with the same tense fear I’d experiencedin Iraq.I spent a good deal of time heavily dependent on alcohol and drugs, includingdrugs such as clonazepam prescribed by well-meaning psychiatrists at the VA,drugs that were extremely addictive and led to a lot of risky behavior.After getting out and realizing I needed to start helping myself, I decided thatI wanted to learn meditation from an authentic Asian master, so I went to Japanto train at a traditional Zen monastery, called Sogenji, in the city of Okayama,Japan. Spending hours in the half-lotus position reminded me of the “stresspositions” we used during enhanced interrogations after waterboarding becameforbidden.I am profoundly grateful to Shodo Harada-Roshi, a true modern Zen master, forfacilitating that experience. However, after leaving the monastery, I realizedthat I would not be able to maintain that level of meditation on my own, that Iwould need faster and easier ways, and a better understanding of mind and body,to make meditative practices a useful part of my life.I was really amazed, then, to come across, one day while researching on theInternet, a man, Dawson Church, who had already put together such a program, a“meditation of meditations” he calls EcoMeditation.When I first came across his EcoMeditation, I simply read from the web page andfollowed the steps, and within two minutes found myself activating all thesehealing resources and entering a state of profound relaxation and well-beingthat I’d previously achieved only after hours, if not days and weeks, ofmeditation.Bryce has become a passionate advocate for the use of EcoMeditation in theDepartment of Veterans Affairs. He believes that simple, low-cost self-helpmethods should be available to all veterans.Thousands of people have now followed the seven simple steps atEcoMeditation.com [http://EcoMeditation.com] and had the same profound andimmediate experience of peace that Bryce had. As we investigate their physicalchanges, we find that their cortisol drops, along with their heart rate(Groesbeck et al., 2016). Their levels of immune hormones rise, as does theirhappiness. Depression, anxiety, and pain drop significantly. Inner peace reducesstress and produces beneficial changes in the body down to the level of geneexpression.YOUR INNER STATE IS YOUR GENETIC REALITYPersonal genetic testing is now widespread. Many people know what genes theyhave and understand their susceptibility for specific diseases based on theirgenetic profile. At workshops, I often get the question, “I have the XYZ gene.Doesn’t that mean I’m destined to get XYZ disease?”People get so worried about the results of gene tests. Yet as you see from theprevious lists of genes, many are dramatically shifted by tapping andmeditation.It’s not the genes you have that determine your destiny as much as what you dowith them. Subject your body to high levels of stress over long periods of timeand you upregulate the expression of cancer genes.But make the opposite choice, and tap and meditate daily, and you reduce yourstress. Along with it, your gene expression shifts. When those 810,000 cellsthat are being formed every second are birthed in an energy field of love andkindness, their gene expression is regulated by that field.Mind to matter is not an abstract metaphysical proposition. It is a physicalfact, as material as the bodies we live in. Thought by thought, moment bymoment, our minds are creating the energy fields in which our cells reproduce.Positive thoughts provide our cells with an energy culture in which they thrive.Thoughts that nurture our cells as they regenerate become thriving molecularmatter. Energy is epigenetic, regulating the processes of life and healing. Whenwe elevate our consciousness to the infinite, generating the energy recipe ofincandescence in our brains, our cells take form within the inspired energetictemplate we provide.PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEActivities to practice this week: * Practice altruism: Smile at strangers today.

It’s a beautiful day, with a cloudless sky anda light breeze ruffling the ocean. Children are playing around me, and happyvacationers are splashing in the water. Snorkelers are ogling the turtle colonyon the reef offshore, while kayakers and paddle-boarders ply the bay.I’d flown to Hawaii to finish my book. The publisher’s deadline was perilouslyclose and I hadn’t been making much progress at home, torn between the demandsof single-parenting two young children and running a demanding business.Escaping to Hawaii seemed like a good way to give myself a window to completethe manuscript.After working all morning, I decided to give myself a break. As I had poundedaway on my laptop earlier, I could see the happy scene and the beach. My mindsaid, You’re in Hawaii! Why are you sitting here cooped up in this dark condoinstead of playing on the beach?After those thoughts had driven me crazy for a few hours, I succumbed to theirlogic and headed for the beach.Now, lying on the warm sand, my mind starts chattering again. What are you doinghere on the beach? it demands. The whole purpose of getting away to Hawaii wasto write the book. You aren’t writing a thing. You’re just lying around doingnothing.How true, I reflect. I give a sigh, roll up my blanket, and head for the condo.That’s the double bind in which we live. Our inner critics give us hellregardless of which choice we make. When I was writing inside the condo, myinner critic savaged me for not enjoying the beach. As soon as I went outside,it began lambasting me for not writing. Damned if I do, damned if I don’t.Nothing I could do could please my inner critic. Many of us are trapped on asimilar hamster wheel of endlessly repetitive negative thoughts.NEGATIVE THOUGHTS BESIEGE THE MINDA study of psychologically normal people found that they had about 4,000distinct thoughts each day. Of those, between 22 percent and 31 percent wereunwanted and uncontrollable intrusive thoughts, while 96 percent of them wererepetitive thoughts about daily activities (Klinger, 1996). The ClevelandClinic’s Wellness Program says that 95 percent of our thoughts are repetitiveand 80 percent of them are negative.Two thousand years ago, the Buddha identified the mind as the source of oursuffering. In the Bhagavad Gita, Arjuna laments, “The mind is very fickle indeedO Krishna, turbulent, strong and obstinate.” Most of us are trapped in the cycleof negative thinking, with no idea how to escape. But why did our huge andcomplex brains evolve to work that way?THE EVOLUTIONARY VALUE OF NEGATIVE THINKINGBoth repetitive thinking and negative thinking make sense from the perspectiveof evolutionary biology. For our distant ancestors, repetitive thinking handledroutine life tasks in the background, while hypervigilant negative thinking gavethem a survival advantage by keeping them attuned to possible threats from theenvironment.The brain is designed to default to beta brain waves under survival conditions.Beta is the signature brain wave of fear. Fear was what kept our ancestorsalive. Their degree of paranoid hypervigilant alertness was in direct proportionto their degree of survival. Miss the tiger in the grass, even for a second, andyou got eaten.Consider the tale of two teenage sisters 100,000 years ago. We’ll call one Hugand the other Gug.Hug is the happiest of people. As she carries water from the stream to thevillage each day, she sings for joy. She stops to smell the fragrant yellowroses. She pauses to listen to the sound of children laughing. She’s filled withwonder as she gazes on the orange and grey hues cast by the rising sun. Shenotices the good in all the other people in the village.Her sister, Gug, is the opposite. Suspicious and paranoid, Gug is always lookingfor what’s wrong. Show her a silver cloud, and she’ll point out the dark lining.She sees problems at every turn. She notices every imperfection in her fellowvillagers. When she carries water from the stream to the village, others avoidher. Except for Hug, who searches for the good in everyone and tolerates Gug’scompany.One day, they’re ambushed by a hungry tiger hiding in the grass. Gug, always onthe lookout for threats, spots the tiger a split second before Hug. She screamsand starts running just a nanosecond before Hug sees the tiger and runs too.Hug gets eaten by the tiger. She never makes it to puberty. But Gug reproduces,passing her threat-detection genes on to the next generation.Multiply this by 1,000 generations, with each one getting a little bit better atfinding the bad stuff. The ability to notice what’s wrong in the environment hasnow been honed by natural selection to a fine art. That brings us to today, andto you and me. Even when absolutely nothing is wrong, the caveman brains we’veinherited from Gug are diligently scanning the horizon for threats.Our distant ancestors could make two kinds of mistakes. One was thinking thatthere was no tiger hiding in the grass when there was, and the other wasthinking that there was a tiger in the grass when there wasn’t (Hanson, 2013).image [images/p177.jpg]Our brains evolved to be exquisitely sensitive to environmental cues that signaldanger.The second kind of mistake carries no immediate evolutionary penalty. Beingattuned to threats, looking for the bad stuff, just makes you a miserablecurmudgeon like Gug. It also guarantees your survival.The first kind of mistake carried the death penalty. Miss the tiger in the grassjust one time and you get eaten. People like Hug who lacked the ability to focusrelentlessly on threats got weeded from the gene pool.If she’d been watching me on the beach in Hawaii, Mother Nature would have givenme gold stars for having such a well-developed ability to find the bad stuffeverywhere I went. Unfortunately, caveman brain cares nothing for my happiness.Whatever my choice, my inner critic chews me to shreds.THE ORANGE APRON THAT COULD NOT CUT KEYSThe Home Depot chain is famous for the orange aprons worn by staff. I walkedinto my local Home Depot one day to get a key cut. It was for my old RV, a 1983Ford Econoline. The man who ran the key-cutting machine was at his station and Ishowed him the key.He took it like it was an infected kidney and shook his head, saying, “I don’tthink we carry that style of key.”I pointed out that the Ford Motor Company had manufactured about three millionof these vehicles, so they weren’t exactly rare. He said, doubtfully, “It’s adouble-sided key,” as though that represented an insurmountable difficulty.“You cut the same key for me last week,” I offered, helpfully.He inserted the key into the laser reader, and after a scan, a red lightflashed.“No,” he said mournfully, “we don’t carry that one.”“Could you try it again?” I pleaded.He punched the on switch again, the laser scanned the key, and this time a greenlight appeared.“We’re really low on blanks,” he said next, shaking his head.“Can you just look?” I asked, politely.He perused his stock, found the blank, and cut the key. All with the air of aman who has been let down by the world. His superpower could even make the lasermalfunction.The impatient part of me wanted to grab him by the shoulders and cheer him up.Buy him a copy of The Power of Positive Thinking. Give him a free pass to one ofmy workshops. Deliver one of my rousing keynote speeches.The compassionate part of me extended itself into his consciousness. What mightit be like to live in a mind that sees difficulties where there are none? Whereyour thinking defeats the simplest of enterprises before you even begin? What isit like to inhabit a mind predisposed to failure?CAVEMAN BRAINEven though our ancestors left the savanna thousands of years ago, most of usstill look much harder for what’s wrong around us than for what’s right.When we wake up in the morning, our brains have been in theta and delta sleepstates. We emerge into alpha, and it feels like we’re in suspended animation asour brains gradually wake up to the day. Then beta kicks in and we startthinking. And worrying. The evolutionary mechanism that identified the tigersprings into action. A parade of paper tigers flows through our minds. We startthinking thoughts like this:Is this the day that report is due on my boss’s desk? Or is it next week?What will I have for breakfast? Will it make me fat?Did I hear my husband snoring last night?What kind of mood are my kids in today? Will they make my life miserable?I don’t think the shoes I was planning to wear today are right for my outfit.Did we run out of coffee?I need to catch up on that disaster I watched on the news last night.What’s the weather like?If Jane didn’t leave a comment on my Facebook post, I’m going to be mad.How much red is there in the commuter lane on Google Maps?Once you wake up, your brain starts to drive you crazy with worry. Yet this isexactly what our brains evolved to do. When Gug woke up, she needed to be alertto a hostile environment from the second she opened her eyes. Might a tiger havecrept up to the cave while she was sleeping? The Neanderthal who woke up grumpy,suspicious, and paranoid lived. Her sister who woke up happy, content, andpeaceful missed those tiny survival cues that made the difference between lifeand death.Today, without predators, we still wake up and immediately start to worry.Thoughts flood into our minds. The floodgates open and our minds churn in atorrent of anxiety. Before we’ve even walked out the front door to start ourday, we’ve been consumed by anxious thoughts.image [images/p180.jpg]There are two basic survival questions: Can I eat it? Will it eat me?Caveman brain takes a toll on our bodies. In an eight-year study of 68,222adults published in the British Medical Journal, researchers found that evenmild anxiety produces a 20 percent greater risk of death (Russ et al., 2012).The very skill that kept our ancestors alive—looking for the bad stuff andignoring the good stuff—is killing us today. Our minds have become a majorthreat to our survival. Caveman brain is a fatal condition.CARRYING THE WOMAN FOR A DAYThere’s a charming Zen story about two celibate monks who were on a longjourney. One morning they came to a stream that was swollen with floodwater. Onthe bank was a young woman who couldn’t get across. The older of the two monkshoisted her onto his broad shoulders, and both monks walked into the water andcrossed safely to the other side. After thanking the old monk, the woman went onher way.The two monks walked in silence till dusk, but there was tension in the air. Thedam of emotional intensity in the younger monk eventually burst. “The rules ofour religion forbid us to touch women,” he said. “How could you have done that?”“My son,” said the older monk, “I picked her up and set her down this morning.You have been carrying her all day.”The angry inner ruminations of the younger monk had been raising his stresslevel long after the event was over. That’s what we do when we obsess about thepast or fear for the future. Using the system designed by Mother Nature to beengaged only when we are in true danger, we send stressful messages to ourbodies with our thoughts, compromising our ability to regenerate and heal.With Audrey Brooks, Ph.D., a research psychologist at the University of Arizona,I did a study of health-care workers. Professionally, they worked aschiropractors, nurses, psychotherapists, doctors, or alternative practitioners.We measured their levels of psychological distress before and after a one-dayEFT tapping workshop. We assessed participants at five workshops, and the finalstudy included 216 participants (Church & Brooks, 2010).image [images/p182.jpg]The health-care workers tapped together in groups.We found that symptoms of anxiety, depression, and other mental health issuesdropped an average of 45 percent in the course of the day. When we followed upsix months later, those who had kept tapping had the lowest stress levels.But one of our striking findings was just how stressed health-care workers are.On the scale we used for the study, a score of 60 represents such severe anxietyand depression that you need treatment. Their average starting score was 59.That’s just one point less than the diagnostic threshold of 60. And that’s theaverage; many individuals were more stressed than their patients. Being ahealth-care professional doesn’t mean you can escape caveman brain.THE WHIRLPOOL OF DEPRESSIONBy Naomi Janzen, EFT Universe trainerI went through an 18-month period of depression after the end of a terriblerelationship. I tried everything to shake it, but I could not. I felt trapped inan endless loop of anger and grief. I was being dragged around and around bythis whirlpool of negative thoughts and feelings.It used to exasperate me when I would read helpful pamphlets on depression thatwould say, basically, “Snap out of it.”I had a lot of tools. If anyone was capable of snapping out of it, it was me.But I’d wake up every morning at 3:11 A.M., when my defenses were down. Icouldn’t stop thinking about the man who had hurt me. The loop kept going. I wasobsessed with justice I knew I would never get. The whirlpool dragged me aroundin a circle of repetitive thoughts.If you have a friend who, maybe 20 years after a breakup, keeps talking aboutit, with nothing new to say, have compassion on them. They’re in the whirlpoolof looping anger and grief.EFT rescued me from the endless loop, the whirlpool, and got me to dry land. Nowmy job is to help other people escape from their whirlpools!The whirlpool that Naomi Janzen describes, in which the mind loops endlesslythrough a list of negative thoughts, is what kept her ancestors alive, but it’sworse than useless today. These patterns rob us of peace of mind, drive ourcortisol through the roof, and deprive our bodies of the resources they need toregenerate and heal. Even very smart people like Naomi often find, to theirfrustration, that they can’t talk themselves out of the whirlpool. It takes apowerful psychospiritual tool like EFT to break the looping mental patterns ofcaveman brain.SLOW-BURNING AND FAST-BURNING STRESS HORMONESAfter completing the health-care workers study, I was intrigued by how quicklypeople could shed stress with EFT. I looked for a way of measuring changes inthe body, and I found it in cortisol.Cortisol is one of our two primary stress hormones, the other being adrenaline(also called epinephrine). You can think of adrenaline as our short-actingfight-or-flight hormone. When we’re stressed, it kicks in immediately. In underthree seconds, it speeds up our heart rate, contracts our blood vessels, anddilates our lungs. That gives our caveman the physical boost required to escapefrom danger.Cortisol is our long-acting stress hormone. It rises and falls on a regular,slow curve throughout the day. It rises sharply in the morning, perking us upand getting us ready for an active day. It’s at its lowest level around 4 A.M.,when we’re in deep sleep. It peaks at 8 A.M. When it starts declining, between 8P.M. and 10 P.M., we become drowsy.image [images/p184.jpg]The cortisol cycle.Like adrenaline, however, cortisol rises in just a few seconds when we’restressed. Stress disrupts the slow, even, daily cortisol rhythm. When you’rerunning from a tiger, cortisol rises along with adrenaline. When you’re worried,cortisol also rises.Our bodies are designed to flourish with normal levels of cortisol synthesizedalong the smooth curve of the cortisol cycle. They are not designed to handlehigh levels of cortisol continuously. Chronic high cortisol leads to widespreadbody damage, including: * High blood pressure * Death of neurons in the brain’s memory centers * High blood sugar * Heart disease * Diminished cell repair * Accelerated aging * Alzheimer’s disease * Fatigue * Obesity * Diabetes * Slow wound healing * Reduced bone repair * Fewer stem cells * Reduced muscle mass * Increased skin wrinkling * Fat around the waist and hips * Osteoporosisimage [images/p185.jpg]Cortisol kills neurons in the hippocampus, one of the structures of theemotional midbrain.Over time, high cortisol disrupts cell metabolism so that excessive calciumenters brain cells and produces free radicals, the most harmful molecules in thebody. Free radicals trigger a range of degenerative illnesses and rapid aging(McMillan et al., 2004). High cortisol also leads to dysfunction in ourmitochondria, the “energy factories” of cells (Joergensen et al., 2011). We thenfeel tired and our energy levels crash. Cortisol kills neurons in the brain’shippocampus, which governs emotional regulation, memory, and learning (Sapolsky,Uno, Rebert, & Finch, 1990). Cortisol is accompanied by high beta brain waves,the signature waves of stress and anxiety.CHRONIC HIGH CORTISOLSo when we get stressed for a few minutes, are we wrecking our bodies?The answer is no. Bodies are designed to handle quick spikes of stress and thenreturn rapidly to their normal baseline. Just two minutes after a stressfulevent, our body has already disassembled the fast-acting adrenaline molecules itbuilt in response to danger (Ward et al., 1983). Slow-burning cortisol takesabout 20 minutes to dissipate (Nesse et al., 1985). Your body is designed togenerate cortisol quickly in response to an objective threat and dissipate itquickly when the threat is gone.So if cortisol and adrenaline molecules dissipate rapidly, how can our levelsstay high over time?By thought—especially thought that triggers strong emotion. This sends signalsthrough the neural pathways of negativity in our brains.We cause chronic cortisol production by turning our attention to those factorsin the environment that stress us out. Negative thinking drives high cortisoleven when there is no tiger in the grass. Our brilliant brains are able toruminate about the bad thing that happened in the past or the bad thing thatmight happen in the future. Even if it never happened and will never happen, wecan nonetheless focus on it, picture it, contemplate it, imagine it, talk aboutit, and catastrophize about it.The body cannot distinguish between an actual threat and a perceived threat. Ithas no way of knowing that the imaginary threat we are conjuring up in our mindsusing negative thinking is not an actual threat to our survival. Purely bythought alone, we can drive cortisol up and produce corrosive effects on ourcells.RESETTING STRESS HORMONE LEVELSAs I watched clients sigh and relax after EFT tapping sessions, I wondered whatmight be happening invisibly, inside their bodies, to their stress hormones. Toanswer this research question, I designed a study to examine their cortisollevels. With colleagues from the California Pacific Medical Center and theUniversity of Arizona, I conducted the first study that examined psychologicalconditions such as anxiety and depression as well as cortisol levels before andafter EFT (Church, Yount, & Brooks, 2012).The study was ambitious and took several years to complete. It was conducted atfive integrative medical clinics in California and included 83 subjects. It wasa triple-blind randomized controlled trial, the gold standard of scientificproof. The results were provocative, and the study was published in aprestigious journal, the oldest peer-reviewed psychiatry journal in NorthAmerica.We assessed subjects’ mental health, and also measured their cortisol, beforeand after a single therapy session. One group received EFT, a second group talktherapy, and a third group simply rested.The results were striking. Psychological symptoms such as anxiety and depressiondeclined in the talk therapy and rest groups, but they dropped more than twiceas much in the EFT group. Cortisol dropped by 24 percent, showing that EFT washaving an effect inside the body.DEVASTATED BY THE LOSS OF THE LOVE OF HIS LIFEDean, one of the participants in the cortisol study, was a 58-year-old malepsychiatric nurse who had been randomized to the talk therapy group. Dean’sscores on psychological distress were as high after the therapy session asbefore, and I was concerned about his well-being.In the second treatment session, instead of talk therapy, we used EFT. We workedon a memory around which he had a high emotional charge: breaking up with hisgirlfriend. He told me that he thinks about the breakup every day.He said that on the last day, he drove his girlfriend to the airport and put heron an airplane. He teared up as he remembered, “with stunned regret,” the imageof her walking down the jetway.The adult event reminded him of a childhood incident. When he was five yearsold, he saw a television advertisement in which Gina Lollobrigida was touted as“the most beautiful woman in the world.”After watching the advertisement, little Dean went to the bathroom, climbed uponto a stool, and looked at himself in the mirror. He concluded that he was notgood-looking and realized he never would be. When he described the memory, heexperienced a sharp pain in his solar plexus, but after tapping, he felt muchbetter at the end of the session.When Dean’s cortisol results arrived back from the lab (SabreLabs.com[http://SabreLabs.com]) a few days later, they showed that his cortisol levelshad dropped from 4.61 ng/ml to 2.42 ng/ml, or 48 percent, after the tappingsession. But after his earlier talk therapy session, Dean’s cortisol had risenfrom 2.16 ng/ml to 3.02 ng/ml, an increase of 40 percent (Church, 2013). Thisechoes other research showing that therapies that engage the body are usuallymore effective than those that engage the mind alone.Later, I had the opportunity to find out just what was happening inside thebodies of people taking a five-day residential EFT workshop. This particularworkshop was held at California’s Esalen Institute, the place where Gestalttherapy, Rolfing, humanistic psychology, and many other groundbreakingapproaches were first developed.image [images/p188.jpg]Esalen Institute front gate.The research team measured a comprehensive panel of physiological markers aswell as psychological conditions such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD (Bach etal., 2016). As anticipated, large improvements in mental health occurred duringthe week.However, the changes in physiological markers of health were extraordinary.Cortisol dropped by 37 percent. Salivary immunoglobulin A, an immune marker,rose by 113 percent. Resting heart rate dropped by 8 percent, and blood pressurewas reduced by 6 percent. The blood pressure, cortisol, and heart rate figuresshowed that participants were much less stressed at the end of the week than atthe beginning.While an hour of EFT had reduced cortisol by 24 percent in the previous study,five days of tapping was associated with an even bigger stress-reduction effect.Participant pain dropped by 57 percent, while happiness increased by 31 percent.When we reassessed psychological symptoms six months later, most of theimprovements had held. This close association between physical health and mentalhealth is a pervasive finding in research in meditation, EFT, and otherstress-reduction techniques.image [images/p189.jpg]At each moment, the body’s processes, such as stress and relaxation, lie at apoint on a continuum.Tapping and meditation dial down stress. Stress isn’t like a light switch,either on or off. It’s like a dimmer switch, getting brighter or darker. When werelax, this nudges our cortisol levels and beta brain waves lower. When we getstressed, we move the needle in the opposite direction. Gene expression,hormones, brain states, and stress all operate on this type of continuum. Eachstrong emotion we have, positive or negative, moves the needle in one directionor the other.COHERENT MIND = COHERENT MATTERThe caveman brain is not efficient. Addled by beta waves and intoxicated withcortisol, it’s chaos. Imaging studies show that the four lobes of the brain fallout of synchrony and that groups of neurons fire chaotically rather than inharmony. In the scientific literature, the word for efficiency is coherence.When the brain is functioning at peak efficiency, an EEG scan shows coherencebetween brain regions and neural groups.When our consciousness is disrupted by stress, our brains are not coherent. Inthis state, the creations of our minds are not coherent either.But when we drop our stress, train our unruly minds to remain calm, and releasenegative thinking from our consciousness, our brains become coherent. In highlycoherent states, our minds are able to create effects in the physical world thatare astonishing.THE POWER OF COHERENT LIGHTLasers use coherent light, while non-laser light sources such as LEDs orincandescent bulbs use incoherent light. Put another way, a laser is set up sothat all the light rays are parallel to each other rather than going off inrandom directions. This characteristic of coherence makes lasers extraordinarilypowerful. Light from a 60-watt incandescent light bulb can faintly illuminateobjects two to four yards or meters away. It converts only about 10 percent ofits energy into light, and that light is not coherent.Organize that same 60 watts of light into a coherent laser, however, and it cancut through steel.image [images/p190.jpg]Coherent versus noncoherent light.An ordinary handheld laser pointer of the kind used in lectures, with a tinypower source of just 5 thousandths of a watt, can illuminate a point 12 miles or20 kilometers away (Nakamura, 2013). Using a trillion times more power (1billion watts), scientific lasers can even bounce off the moon and reflect backto earth (Shelus et al., 1994).Mental coherence is similar. When our brain waves are coherent, the quality ofthought they produce is focused and efficient. We can turn our attention toproblems, focus on them, and solve them.BRAIN FOGWhen our brains are not coherent, we aren’t able to think clearly. We’reafflicted by “brain fog,” and our wooly brains can’t think clearly. When we’reupset, problems seem opaque, we’re easily confused, and our cognitive abilitiesplummet. Brain researcher Joseph LeDoux calls this “the hostile takeover ofconsciousness by emotion” (LeDoux, 2003).image [images/p191.jpg]Laser used for astronomical observations at the Goddard Space Flight Center.Brain studies have found that it takes less than a second for a statement oreven a single word to trigger an emotional reaction (Davidson, 2003). By thetime we recognize that we’re under stress, our brains have already beentriggered. We can be overwhelmed by emotional reactions in just a fraction of asecond, producing brain fog and the inability to think clearly.When that happens, our access to remembered skills and rational thinking isgreatly impaired. We are unable to be objective and consider a problemrealistically. Stress can result in a drain of more than 70 percent of the bloodfrom the frontal lobes, the cognitive centers of the brain. As blood carriesoxygen, this means that the brain is not getting its normal supply of oxygeneither. We can’t think straight when the blood and oxygen flow to our brains isreduced as a result of being stressed. The caveman doesn’t have to be able to dolong division in his head; he just needs to be able to escape from the tiger.When that primitive survival response is triggered by thought and emotion, theresult is a huge reallocation of biological resources. Blood flows out of theprefrontal cortex into the muscles. Suddenly, all those wise skills you have inyour prefrontal cortex, your thinking brain, are no longer available to you.It’s like a computer, which has masses of data stored on its hard drive. If youunplug the computer, all the stored information is still there, but you can nolonger access it; there is no power to make it useable.image [images/p192.jpg]Capillaries before (above) and 14 seconds after (below) a stress signal. Theycan contract by over 70 percent.When you lose the blood supply to your prefrontal cortex, it’s like a computerthat’s unplugged. All the resources that are stored in that part of yourbrain—the skills learned in therapy, the brilliant solutions you’ve read inbooks, the methods you’ve practiced in classes, the strategies you’ve learnedfrom experts—all these are unavailable to caveman brain.Come into coherence, however, and your resources come online. Like the laserpointing at the moon, you’re able to perform inspired long-range planning. Youthink clearly about problems, you focus on your goals, your imagination isunlocked, and your creativity soars. That’s the power of a coherent mind.image [images/p193.jpg]Incoherent brain waves.image [images/p194.jpg]Coherent brain waves. In coherence, all the parts of the brain are workingtogether.COHERENT MIND AND THE FOUR FORCES OF PHYSICSA coherent mind focuses the power of attention the way a laser focuses the powerof light. People who achieve high levels of coherence are able to doextraordinary things. Remarkable research now shows that a coherent mind canliterally bend the forces of the material universe. There are four fundamentalforces in physics: gravity, electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force, and theweak nuclear force.The strong force is what holds atoms together. The protons and neutrons in thenucleus of an atom contain huge amounts of energy, and the force required tohold them together is enormous, which is why it’s called the strong force. Itoperates at very short distances between components of an atom.The weak nuclear force is the one that gives rise to radioactive decay. In thisprocess, the nuclei of atoms break down because they do not have enough energyto hold together. Energy and matter are released from these unstable nuclei overa period of time until they form a different, stable element that is notradioactive.Different radioactive substances have different rates of decay. Some are verylong while others are very short. The half-life of uranium-238 is very long,about 3.5 billion years. The half-life of another element, francium-233, is just22 minutes.These half-lives are so consistent that you can set your watch by them.Scientists who need precise measures of time use an atomic clock and referencetheir experiments by International Atomic Time, a scale that uses the combinedoutput of 400 highly precise atomic clocks in various parts of the world. Onesecond is defined as the period it takes for one cesium-133 atom to oscillate9,192,631,770 times.image [images/p195.jpg]A cesium atomic clock constructed in 2004 for a lab in Switzerland that operateswith an uncertainty period of 1 second every 30 million years.A radioactive element often used in studies is americium-241. Discovered in1944, it has a half-life of 432 years, emits what are known as alpha particles,and is stable at room temperature. It’s also ubiquitous in our homes, where itpowers most smoke detectors. It’s safe, since its alpha radiation travels only 3cm (under 1.5 inches) and is stopped by almost any solid object. If smokeparticles enter the detector, they’re hit by the alpha particles, triggering adrop in electrical current, which sets off the alarm.The weak nuclear force is not affected by electromagnetism or gravity. In fact,it is 10 trillion trillion times stronger than gravity.Given the stability of atomic radiation, so consistent that it powers atomicclocks, you might imagine that it would be very hard to change. Yet that isexactly what a number of researchers have tried to accomplish using the humanenergy field as the agent of change.QI = MC2A qigong master named Dr. Yan Xin projects qi, or life energy, to his patients.Scientists at the Institute of High Energy Physics, part of the Chinese Academyof Sciences, decided to put Dr. Yan’s powers to a rigorous objective test.They asked him to alter the rate of decay of a tiny 2-mm americium-241 diskinside a plexiglass container. One of the four fundamental forces of physics,the decay rate of radioactive substances is immune to high temperatures, strongacids, massive electromagnetic fields, or extreme pressures.For the first eight sessions, Dr. Yan projected qi energy to the americium for20 minutes while standing nearby. A second americium disk was used as a control.He was able to change the decay rate of radioactive alpha particles in thetarget disk while leaving the control disk unchanged. He could either slow downor speed up the decay rate, whichever was requested of him (Yan et al., 2002).For the next three sessions, the researchers decided to study whether the effectdiminished with distance. They placed Dr. Yan 100 to 200 meters away from theamericium source. This made no difference in the results.They then tested whether being in a distant city would weaken the effect. Overthe next five years, they had him project qi into the target disk fromprogressively greater distances, starting 1,500 km away and eventually moving asfar as 2,200 km away. A series of 39 additional trials showed that he was ableto produce the same effect from a distance as he could standing in the sameroom.These 50 separate experiments showed that Dr. Yan could lower the radioactivedecay rate by 11.3 percent and raise it by up to 9.5 percent in the 20-minutecourse of the experiments. It normally takes 432 years for americium to decay, arate of only 0.0006 percent per day, so the passage of time could not explainthe results.image [images/p197.jpg]Readings from the spectrometer with Dr. Yan Xin in the same location as theamericium source.Nuclear physicist Feng Lu, one of the researchers, observed that “Dr. Yan’sresearch transformed the accepted view of the nature of the world. The resultsof his research have demonstrated that the human potential is far greater . . .than that which has been previously thought.”In his book The Energy Cure, Dr. Bill Bengston describes his empirical tests ofthe healer Bennett Mayrick (Bengston, 2010). On one occasion, Bennett was hookedup to a device that measures the rate of radioactive decay. The technicianinstructed him to concentrate on making the radioactive material decay morerapidly. Bengston observed, “The technician gave a yelp. ‘Something’s wrong.This thing says the decay is occurring faster than I believe can be possible.’“Ben playfully replied, ‘Then I’ll slow it down.’“Soon the technician was mumbling something about the decay slowing to almostone-half its normal rate.”When Bengston asked Ben how he did this, Ben said that to speed up the decay, heimagined a cloud, which he then dissolved with his mind. To slow it down, heimagined a frozen rock.MY EUREKA MOMENTOn June 26, 2017, I nervously unpacked my very own Geiger counter. For the pastfew months, I’d e-mailed colleagues—with far more experience than I—copies ofthe Bengston and Yan experiments and urged them to conduct replications. No oneseemed interested.The equipment required was simple and inexpensive, just a Geiger counter and asmoke detector containing an americium-241 disk.The methodology was elementary. Either a healer could slow down the rate ofradioactive decay or he could not. A Geiger counter can measure radiation aseither microsieverts, a standard scientific unit, or counts per minute (CPM).CPM is a count of how many electrons are being released by the radioactivesource.I set up the equipment on my dining room table and figured out how to get abasic radiation reading. I discovered that the baseline in my house fluctuatedbetween 12 and 22 CPM, with an average of 18 CPM.I then placed the Geiger counter over the radiation source, a simple householdsmoke detector. The radiation readings rose to an average of 60 CPM. Just acouple of inches away, the readings were normal; a Geiger counter has to be veryclose to a smoke detector to measure any radiation since the devices aredesigned to be safe for household installation.I performed the seven steps of EcoMeditation and then filled my mind with thesame image that Ben Mayrick had used, a frozen rock. The Geiger counter didn’tregister any change.Well, that’s it, I thought. It didn’t work. That ability may be something only afew people, like Ben or Dr. Yan, possess.But I decided to continue meditating, my hands on either side of the smokedetector. I sent energy through my hands, just as I would with a client to whomI was offering healing.The numbers began to rise. First to the high 60s and then into the 70s. By thetime I’d meditated for a while, it rose to over 80 CPM. I ran the test for 10minutes, and it averaged 80 CPM.I then stopped meditating, and the numbers dropped back to 60 CPM. After another10 minutes, I moved the Geiger counter two feet away from the smoke detector,and the background readings averaged the same 18 CPM as when I began.image [images/p199.jpg]The first experiment on June 26, 2017.I paced around the house with questions exploding in my brain. * Could I get the same result a second time? * Why was I not able to lower the count, only raise it? * Could other people do this? Is the effect more pronounced with gifted healers than it is with ordinary people? * Can anyone be trained to do this? Is it a skill that can be taught? Does this ability improve with practice? * Was my belief in energy healing enhancing the results? * Would skepticism be a barrier to replicating them? * What force could be producing the change in the radiation levels? How can I test this in a way that is methodologically impeccable? * Did it happen because of my magic T-shirt? (just kidding)I had so much energy that I couldn’t go back to my office to do routine work. Ijumped into my venerable relic of a car, a bright red 1974 Jensen Healey, anddrove to the gym to exercise, screaming and shouting and punching the air aroundme. When life hands us such moments, it’s worth celebrating!I now knew that people other than Yan Xin and Ben Mayrick could produce theeffect. The club of radioactivity changers had just expanded from two to three!When my wife, Christine, came back from work that afternoon, I sat her down atthe dining room table to see if we could boost the number of club members fromthree to four.Ten minutes of measuring background radiation gave us an average of 17 CPM. WhenI put the Geiger counter on top of the smoke detector, a 10-minute test gave anaverage CPM of 60. When Christine placed her hands around the source andmeditated for 10 minutes, the CPM dropped to 57, and when I asked her tovisualize her youngest grandchild’s face, it dropped to 52.Christine was able to maintain 52 CPM for 10 minutes. When I asked her to raisethe CPM by using Ben Mayrick’s imagery, the dial didn’t move upward for morethan a few seconds before dropping again. She tried other imagery, but still wasnot able to raise it. This was interesting: I could raise it but not lower it,while Christine could lower it but not raise it.After she stopped, I tested the unattended Geiger counter for 10 minutes and itaveraged 61 CPM. Another 10-minute test, away from the smoke detector, gave us abackground radiation count of 18 CPM. There were officially now four members ofthe club . . . and maybe millions more!THE FIFTH FORCEThe ability to alter the rate of radioactive decay, one of the four fundamentalforces of physics, raises several questions: If one force can be altered by aforce that is not one of the other three, can any of those other three bealtered? Can gravity or electromagnetism, forces far weaker than the two nuclearforces, be changed?Joie Jones, Ph.D., late professor of radiological sciences at the University ofCalifornia–Irvine, teamed up with Russian physicist Yuri Kronn to devise aningenious experiment to determine if electromagnetism is susceptible to change.They pointed out that a “fifth force” is required to do this, and they called it“subtle energy” (Kronn & Jones, 2011).They measured the electrical conductivity of various substances that weredeliberately infused with subtle energy. They found that compared to baselinecontrols, electromagnetism was decreased by 25 percent.An experiment with healing intention measured the magnetic fields around thetargets of healing (Moga & Bengston, 2010). These were mice who had beeninjected with a substance that caused cancer. The healer sent intentionalhealing energy to them locally (with the healer present in the room) for 30minutes on the first day of the study, and then non-locally (with the healer ina distant location) for 12 weeks. Measuring devices in the mice’s cages found anincrease in the magnetic field to 20–30 Hz, followed by a decrease to 8–9 Hz,then a further drop to below 1 Hz. The effect then reversed.Local healing and nonlocal healing produced the same effects. The researcherssubsequently tested various healing modalities and found similar changes in themagnetic field during tai chi and healing touch sessions as well. They alsoreviewed five other studies that measured similar phenomena (Moga & Bengston,2010).This research suggests that at least two of the four fundamental laws ofphysics—electromagnetism and the weak nuclear force—can be altered by a coherentmind holding healing intentions.Kronn and Jones found that their experiments could be done successfully incertain labs but not in others. They were puzzled as to why, and it took themsome time to figure out the difference. It turned out that the labs wherereplications were unsuccessful were those in which experiments on dead animalswere performed. Kronn developed an energy protocol, called “clean sweep,” forthose labs, after which they could successfully host replications (Kamp, 2016).Kronn has found that scientists affect what they’re studying. He says that “Yourown energy will distort the energy pattern you are recording. Similarly, if yourepeat an experiment and you don’t want it to work, then it won’t. Or, when oneof my collaborators has a ‘bad—out-of-tune—day,’ we can’t accurately test energypatterns” (Kamp, 2016).When Christine and I were near the Geiger counter in ordinary consciousness,nothing much happened. But when we meditated, the readout changed. Similarly,Ben Mayrick used vivid mental imagery, while Dr. Yan projected qi energy intothe americium sample, with the intention of either speeding up or slowing downits radioactive decay.Changing matter in this way requires a coherent state of mind. When brain wavesare incoherent, with anxiety-laden beta waves predominating and stress hormonessuch as cortisol and adrenaline infusing our cells, we’re out of the state offlow. Our intentions lack clarity or power.But when we slow ourselves down into a meditative state, with a broad alphabridge connecting our conscious minds to high-amplitude theta and delta waves,we access the power of coherent mind. In this state, our intentions affectmatter.COHERENT MIND AND ACTIVE INTENTIONLed by Rollin McCraty, Ph.D., the Institute of HeartMath in Boulder Creek,California, has been studying the effects of coherent heartbeats for more thantwo decades.image [images/p202.jpg]Heart rate variability (HRV) readouts for anger (above) and appreciation (below)(McCraty, Atkinson, & Tomasino, 2003).image [images/p203.jpg]Heart coherence is a reliable marker of overall physical health, associated withpervasive effects throughout the body. It reduces cortisol secretion and expandsthe amplitude of alpha waves in the brain. It brings not only the brain butother organ systems such as circulation and digestion into coherence too, whilealso boosting the immune system (McCraty, Atkinson, & Tomasino, 2003).McCraty writes: “The current scientific conception is that all biologicalcommunication occurs at a chemical/molecular level through the action ofneurochemicals fitting into specialized receptor sites, much like keys opencertain locks. However, in the final analysis, the message is actuallytransmitted to the interior of the cell by a weak electrical signal.“From these and related findings, a new paradigm of energetic communicationoccurring within the body at the atomic and quantum levels has emerged—one whichis compatible with numerous observed phenomena that could not be adequatelyexplained within the framework of the older chemical/molecular model. ‘Fight orflight’ reactions to life-threatening situations . . . are too immediate andmanifold to be consistent with the key-lock model of communication. However,they are comprehensible within the framework of quantum physics and an internaland external electromagnetic or energetic signaling system, which may alsoexplain . . . the energetic communication links between cells, people, and theenvironment.“Several of the brain’s electrical rhythms, such as the alpha and beta rhythm,are naturally synchronized to the rhythm of the heart and this heart-brainsynchronization significantly increases when an individual is in aphysiologically coherent mode. This synchronization is likely to be mediated atleast in part by electromagnetic field interactions. This is important assynchronization between the heart and brain is likely involved in the processesthat give rise to intuition, creativity, and optimal performance” (McCraty,Atkinson, & Tomasino, 2003).DNA CHANGE IN A COHERENT STATEAn ingenious HeartMath experiment used human placental DNA to test the effect ofhuman intention in a coherent state. The degree of molecular twist in a sampleof DNA can be measured by the molecule’s absorption of ultraviolet light. Thistest can determine whether the molecule’s double helix coils are more tightly orless tightly wound.image [images/p204.jpg]The DNA molecule has a double helix structure, and the degree of its twist canbe measured by its absorption of ultraviolet light.In the study, individuals trained in HeartMath techniques generated feelings oflove and appreciation while holding a specific intention to either wind orunwind the DNA in an experimental sample.The results were profound. In some cases, there was a change of 25 percent inthe conformation of the DNA. Similar effects occurred whether participants weregiven the instruction to wind the helixes tighter or to unwind them.When these participants entered that state of coherence but had no intention ofchanging the DNA, it changed no more than it did with a control group, which wascomposed of untrained local residents and students. When trained participantsheld the intention of changing the DNA but did not move into a coherent state,the DNA likewise remained unchanged.In order to determine just how specific and local the effect might be, in oneexperiment with a highly trained volunteer, three separate vials of DNA wereprepared. The volunteer was asked to wind the DNA spirals tighter in two of thesamples but not in the third. Those were exactly the results measured underlater UV analysis in the laboratory; changes showed up only in the two samplesto which the volunteer had directed his intention.This suggests that the effects are not simply the result of an amorphous energyfield, but are highly correlated with the intender’s intentions.The researchers speculated that the effects might be due to the proximity of thesamples to the participants’ hearts, since the heart generates a strongelectromagnetic field. They therefore performed similar experiments at adistance of half a mile from the DNA samples. The effects were the same. Fivenonlocal trials showed the same effect, all to statistically significant levels.image [images/p205.jpg]Ultraviolet absorption in DNA before and after being exposed to human intention(McCraty, Atkinson, & Tomasino, 2003).These studies demonstrate that the DNA molecule can be altered throughintentionality. The better participants were at generating a state of heartcoherence, the better they were at affecting DNA with their intentions. Controlgroup participants who were untrained and unskilled at heart coherence wereunable to produce an effect despite the strength of their intentions. Bothintention and coherence were required in order to alter the DNA molecules.The researchers suggested that “an energetic connection exists betweenstructures in the quantum vacuum and corresponding structures on the physicalplane,” and that “this connection can be influenced by human intentionality.”McCraty and his colleagues also speculated that the positive emotions affectingDNA might play a role in phenomena such as spontaneous remissions, the healthand longevity rewards of faith, and the positive effects of prayer.Legend holds that the Chinese medicine modalities of herbs and acupuncture are asecondary form of healing. Near the start of the 2,000-year-old book The YellowEmperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine, the basic text of acupuncture, theYellow Emperor says, “I have heard that in early ancient times, there were theEnlightened People who could . . . breathe in the essence of qi, meditate, andtheir spirit and body would become whole.”In the distant past, the original acupuncturists believed, healing occurred bymeans of coherent intention and energy alone. This was a belief in the West aswell. Romantic poet William Blake asked the question: “Does a firm persuasionthat a thing is so make it so?” and replied to himself, “In ages of imaginationthis firm persuasion removed mountains” (Blake, 1968, p. 256).The qi energy of traditional Chinese medicine has also been focused by Dr. Yanon living cells, not just on americium-241. When he applied five minutes ofcoherent mind to cancer cells and healthy cells, the DNA in the cancer cellsdisintegrated while the healthy cells were not harmed (Yan et al., 2006). Inother studies, similar effects were noted in colorectal, prostate, and breastcancer cells.The effect of human-generated healing energy has been measured in a large numberof studies. A systematic review of 90 randomized controlled trials of healingmethods—mainly qigong, healing touch, and Reiki—found that two-thirds of thehigher-quality trials showed that the techniques were effective (Hammerschlag,Marx, & Aickin, 2014).OKAY, IT HAPPENS. BUT HOW?In science, that something is happening is usually observed before we understandhow something is happening. EFT tapping studies showed that anxiety, depression,and phobias could be healed a decade before they showed how these conditionswere being healed (cortisol reduction, brain coherence, gene expression).Medicine knew that aspirin cured pain a century before it understood how. Thatpenicillin killed bacteria was discovered more than 30 years before scienceunderstood how it worked.How are the intentions of a coherent mind able to affect matter?We think of material realities as facts, but in the quantum world, allpossibilities exist simultaneously and then condense into probabilities.Theoretically, any of the swarm of infinite possibilities present in thepossibility wave can become reality. But only one possibility does. The swarm isthen said to have “collapsed” into a particular reality.image [images/p207.jpg]Distribution of quantum probability.One of the factors that determine the direction in which the swarm ofpossibilities collapses is the act of observation. In a quantum universe,phenomena and space and time are affected by the observer. All possibilitiesexist in the quantum field; the act of observation collapses them intoprobability.This is called the observer effect. When subatomic particles are observed, theycollapse from an infinite number of possibilities to a single probability.Without the observer, they remain in a state of indeterminate possibility. Onlywhen observed do they become a single defined probability. The scientificdiscovery that it requires observation to create material fact has profoundimplications for our understanding of the material world and the role ofconsciousness in creating it.THE OBSERVER EFFECTThe observer effect is measured in a classic physics demonstration called thedouble-slit experiment. It has been repeated hundreds of times in the pastcentury. It shows how the presence of an observer changes the outcome of what isobserved.While subatomic particles like electrons are supposed to behave according to thefixed laws of physics, they don’t always cooperate. The double-slit experimentdemonstrates that the act of observing a particle affects its behavior.Electrons are fired at a barrier with two slits in it, and where they end up isrecorded. If they behaved as particles, you’d expect to see two vertical areasof impact on the other side. It would be as if you’d thrown paint-covered tennisballs at the slits and they’d produced two vertical paint splashes on the wall.But the electrons don’t behave like tennis balls. Instead, they interact witheach other to produce a wave. This also happens with photons of light, withwater, and with sound.What happens when you shoot a single photon through the double slits? It stillforms an interference pattern, just as if it were traveling through both slitssimultaneously.However, if you place a detector near the slits and observe the process, theelectrons behave like tennis balls. The wave interaction pattern disappears.If you pass larger particles through the slits, they also behave like tennisballs. But on the level of the subatomic, electrons and photons behave likewaves unless they are observed, in which case they show up as predictabletennis-ball particles. The act of observation completely changes the outcome ofthe experiment, collapsing waves into particles, energy into matter.image [images/p209.jpg]Setup of the double-slit experiment.image [images/p209-1.jpg]Interference patterns. Top: a single slit produces the expected line. The doubleslit produces a wave pattern as observed electrons interact.The double-slit experiment shows that subatomic particles can combine thecharacteristics of a particle and a wave and that the act of observation changestheir behavior. Nobel prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman called it “aphenomenon which is impossible . . . to explain in any classical way, and whichhas in it the heart of quantum mechanics. In reality, it contains the onlymystery [of quantum mechanics]” (Feynman, Leighton, & Sands, 1965).Electrons and photons exist in waves of possibility. The act of observationtriggers the collapse of the wave into a probability. Being measured by amachine produces the observer effect, and so does measurement by a humanobserver.ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN DISTANT PARTICLESA second important principle from quantum physics is the phenomenon ofentanglement. Physicists can produce entanglement by firing a laser through acrystal. Both photons of light and electrons of matter can be entangled. If twoelectrons become entangled, one will spin clockwise and the othercounterclockwise. The act of measuring the spin determines the direction ofrotation.Once a pair of electrons has become entangled, they remain so regardless ofdistance. If a physicist in Paris measures one spinning clockwise, a colleaguein San Francisco might observe its entangled partner spinning counterclockwise.No matter how great the degree of separation, the effect persists.In a key experiment, researchers at the Delft University of Technology beganwith two unentangled electrons. Each electron was entangled with a photon, afterwhich both photons were taken to a third location where they were entangled witheach other. This caused both of their partner electrons to become entangled aswell (Hensen et al., 2015).image [images/p211.jpg]Entanglement between distant atomic particles.An ingenious study performed by Dean Radin and Arnaud Delorme of the Instituteof Noetic Sciences tested the effect of observation by human minds compared torobot observation. They had a double-slit experiment “observed” either by arobot or by human observers. The human observers participated online in a totalof 5,738 sessions over two years. The results of the experiment showed thathuman observation—real live minds—produces a greater observer effect thanmachine observation (Radin, Michel, & Delorme, 2016).THE OBSERVER EFFECT AND ENTANGLED PARTICLESThe observer effect also shows up in entangled particles. In a study using twoentangled photons, each had a possible position of being either horizontal orvertical. Left to their own devices in their own little universe, the twophotons remain in an indeterminate state. But when an observer intrudes on thisclosed system by observing one photon, the possibility wave collapses into aprobability and the photon becomes either horizontal or vertical. Its entangledpartner then responds by taking up the opposite position (Moreva et al., 2014).Physicist Werner Heisenberg said, “What we observe is not nature in itself, butnature exposed to our method of questioning” (1962).image [images/p212.jpg]Not until they are observed do entangled photons take up opposite polarities(Fickler, Krenn, Lapkiewicz, Ramelow, & Zeilinger, 2013).“In the realm of possibility,” says quantum physicist Amit Goswami, Ph.D., “theelectron is not separate from us, from consciousness. It is a possibility ofconsciousness itself, a material possibility. When consciousness collapses thepossibility wave by choosing one of the electron’s possible facets, that facetbecomes actuality” (Goswami, 2004).So the scientific mind, rather than impartially witnessing objective phenomena,is itself influencing which of the infinite sea of potentials winks intoexistence as a phenomenon. Goswami continues, “The agency that transformspossibility into actuality is consciousness. It is a fact that whenever weobserve an object, we see a unique actuality, not the entire spectrum ofpossibilities. Thus, conscious observation is sufficient condition for thecollapse of the possibility wave.”IS SCIENCE THE OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT OF MATERIAL PHENOMENA?Science is usually thought of as the objective measurement of materialphenomena. When a scientist reports that she has found a molecule that killscancer cells and the results are published in a reputable journal, we believethat they are true. When a team investigates a social phenomenon such asemotional contagion and provides a statistical analysis demonstrating theeffect, we confidently assume that it exists.But what if all of science is swayed by the observer effect? What if scientistsare finding things they expect to find, not just at the level of electrons andphotons but stars and galaxies as well? What if the minds of scientists areshaping the matter they observe? What if the strength of their belief isproducing all or part of the effects they’re observing? What if the degree ofbelief scientists possess determines the outcome of their experiments?Belief permeates and shapes the entire field of science. Scientists set out tomeasure something because they believe there is something to be measured. Ifthey don’t believe something is there, they don’t look for it, so they have noway of finding it.An example of this comes from the research into the spiritual states of AIDSpatients. Early AIDS research focused on the disease as a biological phenomenonto be targeted at the level of matter. Only after hundreds of studies had beenperformed with that mind-set did a research team include a questionnaire thatassessed the spiritual states of patients.To their astonishment, they found that the beliefs patients held about God andthe universe affected the progression of the disease. The quantity of AIDS virusin the bloodstreams of those who believed in a punishing God increased threetimes faster than those who believed in a benevolent God. Beliefs predictedwhether patients would live or die more strongly than factors such asdepression, risky behavior, and coping skills (Ironson et al., 2011).Before that landmark study, the importance of spiritual belief was unknown. Notbecause it didn’t exist, but because no one had thought to look for it.The beliefs held in the minds of scientists shape the material reality theydiscover at every turn.THE EXPECTANCY EFFECTIn an influential 1963 animal trial at Harvard University, researchers testedwhat is known as the expectancy effect. If you expect something to happen,you’re more likely to perceive it happening. Professor Robert Rosenthal gavestudents two groups of lab rats. He told them that one group had been speciallybred to be good at running mazes, or “maze bright.” The others had been bred tobe “maze dull.” In reality, the rats had been randomly allocated between the twogroups. The students conducted their tests and duly found the “maze bright” ratsto outperform the others (Rosenthal & Fode, 1963).image [images/p214.jpg]Rosenthal then performed a similar experiment with teachers. He told them thattests showed that certain of their students were entering a year of academicflourishing. In reality, these students had also been selected at random. At theend of the year, the IQ scores of the designated students were higher than thecontrol group (Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1963). Mind had produced matter, withbelief making significant changes in performance in the material world.THE FRESHMAN WHOSE IGNORANCE COULD PRECIPITATE CRYSTALSA grad student who supervised a chemistry lab at MIT described to me one of theprocedures she and her fellow students were required to learn as part of thecurriculum. They had to precipitate sodium acetate crystals out of asupersaturated solution. It was tricky to accomplish and required focusedattention from the budding chemists. Most had to make many attempts and eventhen were not always successful. They knew that the procedure was difficult, andsuccessful precipitation was akin to a rite of passage in the lab.That semester, a first-year student joined the lab as an assistant. The firsttime he attempted the experiment, he was able to precipitate the sodium crystalsimmediately. The supervisor was very surprised. When the student tried it again,the result was the same. The freshman was able to precipitate the crystalseffortlessly every time he tried. “He just has a knack for it,” the supervisorexclaimed, with puzzlement tinged with envy. The student was so green that hehadn’t yet received the memo that the procedure was fraught with difficulty.Variability in the results obtained among individual scientists isn’t supposedto happen in empirical sciences such as physics and chemistry. Molecules andatoms are supposed to behave the same way under the same conditions at alltimes. There is no room in the standard scientific paradigm for scientists’intentions, beliefs, or energy fields to be influencing the results.Yet reports reveal that certain chemists are better than others at makingelements behave and can use their intention to “will” them to conform(Sheldrake, 2012). Physicist Fred Alan Wolf speculates that “the laws of theuniverse may simply be the laws of our own collective minds” (Wolf, 2001).Neuroscience expert Robert Hoss says, “Solid matter is just an illusion. At ourmost fundamental level we may look something like this—an organized soup ofsubatomic particles popping in and out of existence within the infinite energyfield of the universe” (Hoss, 2016).THE MIND OF SCIENCEThe sciences can be classified by the scale and type of their subjects. Firstcomes physics, which studies the most fundamental levels of matter such as atomsand subatomic particles. Then comes chemistry, which looks at how thoseparticles assemble themselves into molecules and interact with each other. Thesesciences are called the physical sciences—or “pure” sciences or “hard”sciences—because they measure the cold, hard objective fact of physical matter.They’re based on mathematics rather than the squishy unpredictability of livingthings.image [images/p216.jpg]The scale of the universe mapped to the branches of science, with physicalsciences as the foundation.Biology and the other life sciences build on physics and chemistry to studyliving cells, tissues, and organisms. These interact in complex systems that areoften unstable and evolving in unpredictable directions. Geology and astronomyalso study solid physical matter. Geology examines the composition of theplanet. Astronomy scales up by a large order of magnitude to look at thematerial structure and motion of stars, galaxies, and the universe.Then come the “soft” sciences of the mind. Psychology examines individualbehavior, while sociology studies the interactions of groups. Those in the hardsciences often feel superior to those in the soft sciences because they dealwith the level of matter rather than that of mind. Physicist Ernest Rutherford,who in 1907 discovered that the atom was mostly empty space and that subatomicparticles are bound together by electromagnetic fields, had a low opinion of theother sciences, sniffing contemptuously, “In science there is only physics. Allthe rest is stamp collecting.”THE REPLICATION CRISISWhen they publish their papers, scientists are required to provide a “methods”section. This outlines how the experiment was set up and does this so clearlythat other scientists can run the same experiment in an attempt to replicate theprevious study’s findings.A discovery published in a single paper may represent an actual effect. But whenan independent research team comes up with the same result, it’s likely that theeffect found in the first study is real. For this reason, replication studiesare important in science.So much so that before it approves a new drug, the U.S. Food and DrugAdministration (FDA) requires two studies demonstrating the drug’s efficacy.When formulating standards for “empirically validated therapies,” the AmericanPsychological Association borrowed the same standard, requiring a replication ofa study before declaring the therapy evidence based (Chambless & Hollon, 1998).In the early 2000s, a giant biotech company, Amgen, set out to replicate someimportant studies. The company was pouring millions of dollars into research oncancer biology based on earlier research. If the effects found in the originalstudies were robust, then the next stage of development of cancer drugs would bebuilt on solid ground. They asked their scientists which previous studies weremost important to their work and came up with 53 “landmark” studies.In 10 years of work, Amgen was able to replicate only 6 of the 53 studies. Theresearchers called this “a shocking result” (Begley & Ellis, 2012).A few months earlier, another giant pharma company, Bayer, had published asimilar analysis. This led to a sustained effort to determine how many keystudies were replicable. An attempt to replicate five cancer biology trials wassuccessful for only two (eLife, 2017). Epidemiologist John Ioannidis of StanfordUniversity summarized the findings by saying, “The composite picture is, thereis a reproducibility problem” (Kaiser, 2017).What about the soft sciences? An international group of 270 researchers set outto replicate 100 studies published in 2008 in three top psychology journals.They found that they were able to replicate fewer than half of them (OpenScience Collaboration, 2015).The journal Nature conducted a survey of 1,576 researchers to identify theirexperiences with replication. It found that over 70 percent of them had failedwhen attempting to reproduce another scientist’s research findings. Over halfcould not even replicate their own research (Baker, 2016).There are many roots to the “reproducibility crisis” in science. A variety offactors stand in the way of successful replications. Among them are haphazardlaboratory management, sample sizes too small to provide a high degree ofstatistical power, and the use of specialized techniques that are uniquely hardto repeat.Selective reporting plays a big role, too, as positive results are usuallyreported while negative ones are swept under the rug. These are called filedrawer studies because, metaphorically, they are thrown into the bottom drawerof a filing cabinet, never to see the light of day. An analysis of psychologystudies estimates that 50 percent are never published (Cooper, DeNeve, &Charlton, 1997).Another factor making studies hard to replicate is that beliefs can influencethe results. Scientists have beliefs. They’re human. They are not godlikeintellects immune from glory seeking, egotism, jealousy, and territorialism.They have whims, preferences, and needs. They need successful research to obtaingrants, jobs, and tenure. They fall in love with their work, the “Pygmalioneffect” immortalized in the musical My Fair Lady. Scientists approach their workwith as many presuppositions as any other demographic group has.Scientists believe in what they’re doing and look for effects they expect tofind. The strength of their beliefs may skew their results, a phenomenon calledthe expectancy effect. To control for this, most medical research is carried outblind. The statisticians analyzing two groups of data don’t know which sample isfrom the experimental and which from the control group.image [images/p219.jpg]Experiments in the physical sciences, such as chemistry and physics, are assumedto be independent of the observer effect, so they are blinded in fewer than onepercent of cases.The same is not true in the hard sciences, such as physics and chemistry.Surveys show that under one percent of studies in these fields are performedblind (Sheldrake, 1999; Watt & Nagtegaal, 2004). The researchers carrying themout know which of the samples is the experimental one, and the beliefs andexpectations in their minds may well be producing the effects they observe inmatter. The observer effect has been measured at the level of atoms andmolecules in the physical sciences as well as on the scale of people andsocieties in the soft sciences.MEASURING THE STRENGTH OF SCIENTISTS’ BELIEF SYSTEMSHow strong are the beliefs of scientists? An interesting test comes from thework of Daryl Bem, a social psychologist at Cornell University, who performedexperiments on precognition. In a series of nine experiments with over 1,000participants, he found a statistically significant link supporting foreknowledgeof future events (Bem, 2011).Bem’s critics so strongly believed that precognition was not true that theyapplied a radically more stringent approach. First, they analyzed each of thenine experiments separately, instead of combining the results to provide thelargest possible pool of data (Radin, 2011). It’s always more difficult to findan effect in a smaller data pool. They then used a statistical test verydifferent from those normally used in psychology studies (Wagenmakers, Wetzels,Borsboom, & Van Der Maas, 2011).The technique they used requires the formulation of two prior beliefs about thephenomenon. The first is the belief that it is true, the other that it is false.They set their level of belief that precognition cannot exist at 100,000trillion to 1 (Radin, 2011). Unsurprisingly, this made the effect go away.Bem’s research team used this same method to re-analyze their own data. Theyfound that even if you had a tiny belief that precognition might be true, thecollective result of their nine experiments showed that it exists. How tiny? Youneeded only a prior belief there was 1 chance in 100 million that premonitionmight occur (Bem, Utts, & Johnson, 2011).You didn’t need to be a true believer in precognition to identify the effect.Even if you were a firm skeptic whose mind allowed just a sliver of belief—1possibility in 100 million—the study validated precognition: “If one begins withthe possibility that retrocausal effects might be real, even when thatpossibility is extremely small, then the strength of the existing evidence willsubstantially shift one’s belief towards [precognition]” (Radin, 2011).UNWAVERING FAITHAn independent team failed to replicate Bem’s study (Ritchie, Wiseman, & French,2012). This led to a large-scale research effort, involving 90 experiments in 33different labs in 14 countries. This time, Bem used both the unconventionalstatistical methods of his critics as well the standard tests of probability andfound that both supported the existence of premonition (Bem, Tressoldi,Rabeyron, & Duggan, 2015).image [images/p221.jpg]Most skeptics don’t believe in premonition.Bem’s first experiment and the re-analysis of his data by his critics provides afascinating but unintentional statistical comparison of just how strong beliefsamong scientists can become. Bem’s detractors could not tolerate a belief ofjust 1 possibility in 100 million that premonition might exist and set thethreshold of their faith at an astonishing 100,000 trillion to 1 (Radin, 2011).That’s the kind of unwavering certainty that the most hardened fundamentalistwould be proud of.The survey in Nature showing that 70 percent of scientists fail at replicationdidn’t make much of a dent in their confidence in science. Their belief remainedstrong. Most still trust published papers. They’re much more optimistic thanthey might be expected to be, based on the data: “Seventy-three percent saidthat they think that at least half of the papers in their field can be trusted,with physicists and chemists generally showing the most confidence” (Baker,2016).What we find when we examine the way science is conducted is that for better orfor worse, it is heavily influenced by belief. The ideal of the scientist as anobjective assessor of facts is at odds with reality. Scientists are believers,especially in their own work. They cannot separate mind from matter.Science is not, in fact, the objective measurement of matter. It’s a dancebetween the inner consciousness, or mind, of the scientist and the materialworld of matter. Change mind, and matter changes right along with it.AT WHAT SCALE DO ENTANGLEMENT AND THE OBSERVER EFFECT OPERATE?The consensus in physics up through the early 21st century was that entanglementand the observer effect occurred only on a micro scale. They were peculiarproperties of the subatomic world, but for structures larger than an atom, goodold-fashioned common-sense cause-and-effect Newtonian physics applied. Becauseentanglement requires communication between particles faster than the speed oflight, Einstein detested it and called it “spooky action at a distance” (Born,1971).So for a century, physicists confined spooky action to the realm of the tiny. Itcould not possibly be operating at the large scales of things like cells andorganisms. In 2011, however, researchers were able to entangle millions of atomstogether at one time (Lee et al., 2011). In 2007, quantum effects werediscovered in the way light is used by bacteria for photosynthesis. In 2010,this phenomenon was measured at room temperature, and in 2014, researchersdiscovered that this quantum coherence in living organisms is organized byfields (Romero et al., 2014).On the human level, research has shown that our sense of smell is able to detectmolecules based on their quantum energetic signature rather than just theirshape (Gane et al., 2013). In the human brain, groups of neurons seem to havetheir own version of quantum entanglement. Widely spaced neural regions are ableto fire in coherence, at the same time, in a process called phase locking,possibly synchronized by quantum communication (Thiagarajan et al., 2010).Another important experiment seeking quantum effects in human brains examinedseven pairs of subjects hooked up to EEGs. They enclosed one person from eachpair in a soundproof room shielded from all known forms of electromagneticradiation. At random intervals, 100 times during the course of the experiment,the brain of the member of the pair outside the room was stimulated briefly.When the two groups of brain wave samples were compared, they showed that thebrains of those inside the shielded room responded to the stimulation of thepartner outside (Grinberg-Zylberbaum, Delaflor, Attie, & Goswami, 1994).In an experiment on a planetary scale, the Chinese government in 2016 launchedthe Quantum Experiments at Space Scale (QUESS) mission. Its goal is to usequantum coherence at distances of thousands of miles to provide ultra-securedata transmission.image [images/p223.jpg]The QUESS teleportation system uses photon entanglement to transmit datasecurely.When data are transmitted through fiber-optic cables, the data get scattered orabsorbed. Preserving the quantum state of photons over large distances is notpossible using this technology. The goal of the Chinese project is to teleportquantum states using entangled pairs of photons.Data are encrypted by polarizing a string of photons, which are then transmittedthrough space by bouncing the data off a satellite to a distant location on theplanet. This eliminates the scattering that occurs when data are transmittedusing fiber-optic cables and results in secure transmission.GLOBAL CYCLESThe serious study of the effects of the fields of the earth, sun, and planets onhuman beings is a recent and exciting new branch of science. The interactionsbetween these global fields and life-forms, and the effects that living beingsare having on the planet’s field, are just starting to be mapped.The largest-scale project to gather data on these interactions is called theGlobal Coherence Initiative (GCI). It uses large, recently developedmagnetometers to measure changes in the Earth’s magnetic field. They are locatedall over the world. They measure “biologically relevant information thatconnects all living systems” (McCraty & Deyhle, 2016).image [images/p224.jpg]The six operating and six proposed Global Coherence Initiative (GCI) monitoringsites.The GCI sensors monitor changes triggered by shifts in the Earth’s magneticfield, by solar storms, and by changes in the speed of the solar wind. They alsotest the hypothesis that collective human consciousness affects this informationfield, and they seek to determine whether “large numbers of people creatingheart-centered states of care, love and compassion will generate a more coherentfield environment that can benefit others and help offset the current planetarydiscord and incoherence.”Russian scientist Alexander Tchijevsky noticed a striking fact when looking atsunspot flares that occurred early in the 20th century. They coincided with themost violent battles of World War I (Tchijevsky, 1971). This led him to analyzeearlier periods dating from 1749 to 1926. He looked at major historical eventsin the histories of 72 countries such as the onset of social revolutions andwars and found the same relationship going back centuries. He identified an 80percent correlation between social upheaval and sunspot activity.image [images/p225.jpg]The upper line represents historical events and the lower line represents thenumber of sunspots during the same period.This effect works in the opposite direction too. Solar activity has been relatedto periods of cultural flourishing and positive social evolution with leaps inthe arts, science, architecture, and social justice (McCraty & Deyhle, 2016).When a person is in a heart coherent state, they also radiate a coherent signalall around their body. When such a person comes together with others, thatproduces a group field effect (McCraty & Childre, 2010). This brings peoplenearby into coherence too. The goal of GCI is both to measure and to influencethese interactions. Large numbers of people in coherence may be able to nudgethe whole psychosphere of the planet toward positive evolutionary shifts.image [images/p226.jpg]One participant’s heart rate variability (HRV) and the magnetic field at theCalifornia GCI site over a 30-day period.This process is expected to “greatly accelerate cooperation, collaboration,innovative problem-solving and intuitive discernment for addressing society’ssignificant social, environmental and economic problems. This will becomeincreasingly apparent as countries adopt a more coherent and inclusive planetaryview. This planetary view will be critical for meaningfully and successfullyaddressing social and economic oppression, wars, cultural intolerance, crime anddisregard for the environment” (McCraty & Deyhle, 2016).Shifts in human consciousness can also be measured using random numbergenerators (RNGs). These are computers that simply generate a continuous streamof zeros and ones at random. Because they’re designed to produce random output,they should not, in principle, do anything else. At moments of peak collectiveexperience, however, the streams of digits that they are constantly generatingdo indeed change. They deviate from randomness, sometimes so far that theresults are statistically significant, meaning that there’s only 1 possibilityin 20 that the results are due to chance. At large sporting events, when thecrowd is going wild, RNGs have been found to deviate significantly from baseline(Leskowitz, 2014).MEASURING SHIFTS IN COLLECTIVE GLOBAL CONSCIOUSNESSThe Global Consciousness Project (GCP) is an international collective ofscientists and engineers. It collects data from 70 host sites around the worldand transmits the data to a central repository at Princeton University (Nelson,2015).When dramatic events engage large numbers of people around the globe and globalconsciousness becomes coherent, the behavior of the RNGs changes. It deviatesfrom randomness. For around two decades, the GCP has been tracking thesechanges. It finds these correlate with significant global events that involvethe awareness of large groups of people. Examples of these events include: * 1998: The bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania * 1999: The aerial bombardment of Yugoslavia by NATO in an effort to stop the massacre of Serbs * 2000: The first visit by the pope to Israel * 2000: The explosion on board the Russian submarine Kursk * 2003: A global candlelight vigil for peace organized by Desmond Tutu and various organizations * 2004: The Democratic Party convention * 2004: The Beslan massacre in which 150 hostages died in Russia * 2005: The Iraqi elections * 2005: The earthquake in Kashmir, Pakistan * 2006: The magnitude 6.2 earthquake in Indonesia in which over 3,000 people died * 2008: The nomination of Barack Obama as president * 2010: The passage of the Obamacare reform act * 2010: The Israeli attack on a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists that killed nine civilians * 2010: The rescue of 33 Chilean miners after 18 days underground * 2011: A global meditation called by New Reality Group, a group of “physicists and mathematicians that believe our very own consciousness defines our reality” * 2013: A global meditation organized by the Peace Portal Activations group * 2013: The death of Nelson Mandela * 2015: International Peace DayThe GCP calculates the statistical probability of these changes occurring. Italso tracks the cumulative possibility that these correlations are happeningpurely by chance. Those odds are one in a trillion (Nelson, 2015).image [images/p228.jpg]On this graph, the possibility of these correlations occurring by chance isindicated by the bottom dashed line. The three smooth curves representincreasing levels of statistical significance. The final result is the jaggedtop line (Nelson, 2015).These large-scale measurements show that collective human consciousnessinteracts with the material world. Carl Jung believed that some elements ofpersonal experience spring from a much larger consciousness shared by allhumankind, which he termed the collective unconscious. He believed that “Thecollective unconscious contains the whole spiritual heritage of mankind’sevolution, born anew in the brain structure of every individual” (1952).Large-scale scientific projects such as the GCP and the GCI are now allowing usto measure the effects of shared experience. We are finding that what weexperience collectively is having an effect on the material world. Group mind isaffecting the matter of the entire psychosphere in which we live.PERSONAL COHERENCE INFLUENCES GLOBAL COHERENCEWhen we come into personal coherence, we feel much better emotionally,spiritually, and physically. Our cortisol levels go down, while theneurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine balance in our brains. We have highlevels of all the brain waves that promote healing and low levels ofanxiety-linked high beta. We feel good subjectively, and this translates intoobjective changes in the biology of our cells. Mind becomes matter as our brainsare flooded with pleasure-inducing endorphins, intimacy-producing oxytocin, andthe bliss molecule anandamide.We’re also then resonant with the corresponding global frequencies. We aren’tliving our lives as isolated human beings but as resonant nodes that are part ofa great universal whole. As we increase our personal coherence, we add ourmeasure to the sum of coherence being generated by everyone else on the planetresonating in synchrony with those energies.In this way, we play a small but significant part in nudging the whole planetinto flourishing. The following story by Joe Marana is an example of thesynchronicities that sometimes tie geological and personal events together.MY SISTER’S LOVE FROM BEYOND THE GRAVEBy Joe MaranaI had lent a cassette set of Wayne Dyer’s audio program Real Magic to a friend.It contains six cassettes. When they were returned to me, they were all rewoundexcept for one cassette. I was a little bit annoyed and thought, Why didn’t herewind this one?Then I thought, Maybe there’s a message here for me. So I went over to myelaborate stereo system with its fancy cassette player, dropped the tape in, andhit the play button.I heard Wayne Dyer’s voice saying, “What if you hadn’t heard from your sister inthree years and you’re thinking about how nice it would be to talk to her?”I was stunned. It was the three-year anniversary of my sister’s death, and I hadbeen missing her terribly.When the mail arrived that day, it included a letter from a lady from Paraguaynamed Juanita Lopez. She has multiple sclerosis, and a few times each year Isend her money. Each time, Juanita would write back and give me a detailed listof what she’d spent the money on. Shoes for her niece. New thatch on her roof. Awater purifier.I opened the letter. At the very top, in block capitals, in handwritingcompletely different from Juanita’s, it said, “I am your everlasting sister andI remember you every day and send you love.”I fell to the ground, and I couldn’t stop sobbing for a long time.I fired off an airmail letter to Juanita asking, “Why did you say that?”The next day, there was an earthquake in Paraguay. It killed four people, andone of them was Juanita Lopez. So I never got a reply.I shared this story with a scientist from the Institute of Noetic Sciences, andhe said that the most likely explanation is entanglement. The letter had beenmailed before I heard the message from Wayne Dyer. Yet somehow they were allconnected.To add to the synchronicities, I heard Joe’s story on a radio show while I wasparked outside a hotel in my car, waiting for my wife, Christine, to check usout. I had just finished keynoting the annual conference of . . . (you guessedit) . . . the Institute of Noetic Sciences.ENTANGLED LIVESEntanglement might be at work in distant healing and nonlocal communication.People who are emotionally close are also neurologically close, no matter thedistance. Research teams at Bastyr University in Seattle and the University ofWashington examined the EEG signatures of people with close emotional bonds.They found that when a partner was shown an image, the other partner, eventhough distant, immediately developed the same pattern of EEG brain function(Standish, Kozak, Johnson, & Richards, 2004).A gifted faith healer might be considered, in quantum terms, to be an observerwho routinely collapses space-time possibilities into the probability ofhealing. A prayer is an intention that might also collapse the swarm ofpossibilities present in the possibility wave in the direction of a certainprobability.In The Intention Experiment, her book about large international experiments thatgauge the effect of human intention on physical matter, Lynne McTaggart statesthat the observer effect implies that “living consciousness is somehow centralto this process of transforming the unconstructed quantum world into somethingresembling everyday reality,” and that “reality is not fixed, but fluid, andhence possibly open to influence” (McTaggart, 2007). According to Bill Bengston,“This suggests that human consciousness, individually and collectively, produceswhat we call ‘reality’” (Bengston, 2010).Robert Hoss, an expert on the neuroscience of extrasensory phenomena such asnear-death experiences and precognitive dreams, asks a provocative question: Ifit is only the act of observation that is collapsing the waves of energy intothe particles of matter that make up the world around us, who or what is doingthe observing? Who is the grand observer catalyzing the creation of all thematter in the physical world? Hoss believes it is consciousness: the greatnonlocal consciousness of the universe itself. That is, the universe itself isconsciousness, continually creating matter out of mind (Hoss, 2016).This view has increasing support from mainstream scientists. Gregory Matloff isa veteran physicist at the New York City College of Technology. He argues thatour individual local minds may be linked to the nonlocal mind of the cosmosthrough a “proto-consciousness field” that extends through all of space. In thismodel, the minds of stars might be controlling their orbital journeys throughmatter. The entire universe may be self-aware. His views are shared by manyothers (Powell, 2017).When we as human beings release the fixation our local minds have on localreality and instead align our local consciousness with the nonlocalconsciousness of the universe, we bring local mind into coherence with nonlocalmind. In this coherent state, what we create with local mind is a reflection ofnonlocal mind. We’re no longer limited by our old, conditioned thinking, so weno longer create the same present-day reality out of the stale experiences ofour past.Instead, we think outside the box. We see possibilities we were blind to whentrapped in local mind. We explore the potential of our lives found in theexpansive awareness of nonlocal mind. We perceive ways in which the world canchange that we simply don’t see when stuck in a noncoherent personal realityfield. The observer effect demonstrates that reality is plastic. Bringing thepower of coherent mind to our experience, our perception creates events that areextraordinary.In my own life, I find it easy to get sucked into the conventional view that“facts are facts” and that the outside world just is the way it is. To correctthis tendency, I practice framing my experiences, good or bad, in ways thatsupport my goals. When I’m acting with awareness, I use my mind to create andmaintain a “reality field” that is congruent with what I want.MAINTAINING THE REALITY FIELDI had a career change at the age of 45. I’d left the book publishing world a fewyears earlier and purchased a small hotel. While I raised my two children, Ilived a semiretired life.I was also bored to tears, feeling cut off from the world of healing and ideasI’d participated in as a publisher.To get back in the game, I decided to publish an anthology called The Heart ofHealing, a reprise of a successful anthology I’d published in the 1980s.I sent letters of invitation to 30 of the best-known names in healing, peoplelike Larry Dossey, Deepak Chopra, Donna Eden, Bernie Siegel, and ChristianeNorthrup.Inside each letter was a stamped blue postcard. I asked each person to check abox saying yes or no and write a line explaining why they were responding thatway.For the following month, I ran out to my mailbox eagerly each day, awaiting thereturn of blue postcards. The first one came from Bernie Siegel with a yes! Iwent back to my office and told my assistant how relieved I felt that at leastone person, Bernie, hadn’t forgotten me after 15 years!Then came one from Larry Dossey with a no.I ran back into my office. I waved the postcard above my head excitedly. Afterseeing the no, my assistant looked at me with a puzzled frown.“I’ve opened a dialogue with Larry Dossey!” I exclaimed.That’s how I framed every no. That blue postcard didn’t represent a closed door,it was the start of a dialogue. I maintained my reality field of a successfulanthology even when faced with evidence to the contrary.Eventually, almost all the no’s did appear in the anthology, which went on towin an award for best health book of the year. As for Larry, he has become afriend and sent me one of the very first endorsements for Mind to Matter.CULTIVATING COHERENT MINDWe can retrain our scattered and chaotic minds to function coherently. EEG scansshow that this produces flares of gamma waves, signaling increased creativity aswell as orchestration of all the regions of the brain. Add to thatsynchronization entrainment with the nonlocal mind of the universe and ourintentions have the focused power of a laser.As Christine and I discovered with the Geiger counter, the ability to useintention to affect molecular matter isn’t a superhuman anomaly. It’s somethinga trained and coherent mind can easily accomplish. Entanglement and thedouble-slit experiments demonstrate that consciousness is influencing thematerial world around us every day.Stanford University professor William Tiller reminds us of the differencebetween incoherent light in an incandescent bulb and the power of organizedlight in the form of a laser. He says: “Just like the light bulb example, vastunutilized potential exists within us, the basic ingredients are already therebut they are relatively incoherent with respect to each other. Our task is totransform the largely incoherent ingredients into a completely coherent system”(Tiller, 1997).Think deliberately. Use this remarkable gift of consciousness to direct yourthoughts rather than being pushed around by reality. Even adverse circumstancescan propel us to greatness if we’ve mastered our minds, deliberately fillingthem with love and purpose rather than doubt and fear.A coherent mind has the power of a laser, able to cut through steel.Consciousness, holding an elevated reality, organizes our neural pathways. Itbrings our brain waves into coherence, along with our hearts and every othersystem in our bodies. It rewires our neural networks. In this state, we’re ableto operate at levels that transcend the known laws of physics.We then join naturally together with other people, aligning with the largesocial energy fields of positive resonance. Synchronicities become the normrather than the exception. As philosopher C. S. Lewis exclaimed, “Miracles are aretelling in small letters of the very same story which is written across thewhole world in letters too large for some of us to see” (Lewis, 1970).Cultivating coherent local mind starts with aligning our consciousness with thefields of love and creativity found in nonlocal mind. That’s why meditatingfirst thing in the morning, while your brain is in an alpha state, before betakicks in, is so effective. Trying to quiet the mind after the floodgates ofthought have already opened is hard. Extending the alpha state you’ve been inwhen your eyes were closed during sleep is much easier.When I wake up in the morning, I want to stretch out that alpha connection aslong as possible, so I meditate immediately. I then start my day with coherentmind rather than caveman brain. These positive mental states have profoundeffects on health and longevity. Optimists have half the mortality rate ofpessimists, and lowering your stress can add 10 years to your life span (Giltay,Geleijnse, Zitman, Hoekstra, & Schouten, 2004; Diener & Chan, 2011).A mind attuned to the infinite is a wonderful place to live. It nudges thematter of our bodies toward health and well-being. It unlocks our creativity. Itshifts our family and community relationships to a state of love, compassion,and pleasure. It nurtures the natural world and influences the psychosphere ofthe entire planet. Our minds, organized into coherence, can illuminate the realmof miracles.PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEActivities to practice this week: * Continue to practice EcoMeditation for at least 10 minutes each morning and evening. * Touch the people in your household every day deliberately.

Though 260 miles square, itboasts not a single traffic light. There are two gas stations serving the 7,000inhabitants, along with one modest grocery store. Visitors stay at anestablishment called the Hotel Molokai—“the” hotel because that’s the one andonly hotel on the island. Visitors can buy postcards entitled “MolokaiNightlife.” They’re solid black.My wife, Christine, and I visited Molokai for the first time a few years back.We had 10 days to relax there, and we had a strong intention of connecting withsome of the local residents and events. Synchronistically, the day before weflew from Maui to Molokai, we met a musician and shaman from Molokai named EddieTanaka. He offered to show us around when he got back to the island a few daysafter we were due to land there.On our first day, after driving the oceanfront road for a few miles, we decidedto take a walk and try to find a trailhead. We got ready to leave our condo,then got distracted and pottered aimlessly around the living room instead. About45 minutes later, we finally wandered downstairs to start our planned walk.My eye was caught by a bumper sticker on a car in the parking lot. It said:“Don’t change Molokai. Let Molokai change you.” I took a photo with my phone toshare on the Love Bathing Facebook page where Christine and I record ourtravels.The owner of the car walked by and noticed me photographing her car, and we fellinto conversation. She was a retired accountant named Joy, and she turned out tobe a fountain of information. She told us where the nearest trails were andabout the community sing-alongs where people connect. She shared the locationsof heiaus, Hawaiian sacred sites that we love to visit, soaking in the energyfields of these ancient places of worship.image [images/p238.jpg]A restored Hawaiian heiau, or ancient temple.It turned out that Joy and her husband lived in the condo below ours. She knewEddie and often played ukulele with him. She told us about his distinctivehouse, with a front wall topped with hundreds of glass bottles. We’d driven pastit that morning.Joy invited us to a community sing-along at the Hotel Molokai the following day,where we met her friends. People welcomed us warmly. At the end of theperformance, everyone held hands in a big circle and sang “Hawaii Aloha”together. My heart was so touched that I cried all the way through the beautifulsong. We enjoyed 10 days in which we “talked story” with Joy, Eddie, and ourother new friends.But the synchronicities had begun long before that. The year before, the20-something daughter of a friend of ours took a whole year off work to explorethe Caribbean, “looking for the perfect island.” I envied her and imaginedtaking a year off to do that myself. Because of my speaking engagements and mylife mission of training people in advanced healing methods, it was impossible.Then one morning after meditation, I realized, You don’t have to move your bodyall over the place in a search for the perfect island. The universe alreadyknows! Just ask your inner guidance. I asked the question, and a still smallvoice said, Check out Molokai. I’d been visiting the Hawaiian Islands for 20years and it had never occurred to me to visit Molokai before that morningmeditation. That nudge led to booking the 10-day vacation.Christine and I had a wonderful time. Molokai has miles of sandy beaches, andthey are usually deserted. Often ours were the only footprints in the sand. Onour hikes, we discovered remote heiaus so overgrown with vegetation that theywere invisible till we stumbled upon them. Magic was in the air every day.image [images/p239.jpg]Miles of sandy beaches on Molokai, with a rainbow thrown in for good measure.Since I was a toddler, I’ve been fascinated by rainbows. On a number ofoccasions, I’ve driven my car for miles, whimsically trying to locate the baseof a particularly vivid rainbow. But I’ve never found a rainbow’s end.One afternoon, as Christine and I drove around a bend on the rugged west side ofMolokai just after a rainstorm, there it was. The rainbow ended on the road justin front of the car. Or rather, one of the rainbows—there were two others endingin the steaming foliage on either side of the road. I’d been granted more thanI’d wished for.We left Molokai feeling loved, rested, and renewed. The morning before ourflight left, we went to our last sing-along, at an old coffee plantation, wherea sizable percentage of the island’s population had turned out to enjoy thehomemade entertainment. I left with tears in my eyes, feeling as though I’dfound a second home.None of the connections we made on that first day on the island would likelyhave happened unless . . . * We decided to go on a walk our first morning. * We got distracted and left 45 minutes later than planned. * I stopped to look at a bumper sticker and stayed long enough to take a photo. * Joy walked by at that exact moment.We would never even have been on Molokai if I had not tuned in to my intuition.Sure, all of this could have happened quite by chance. Yet synchronicities likethis happen to Christine and me all the time. Since we met, we’ve kept arelationship journal in which we record events and epiphanies in our lives.A few years back, we were struck by just how many unlikely synchronicitieshappen to us and how things we think about seem to manifest as if by magic. Webegan writing a big S in our journal to identify those entries and to remindourselves to be grateful for a happy and harmonious life. Journal entries fromour time in Molokai contain S after S after S.GOD’S WAY OF REMAINING ANONYMOUSOurs is not the first generation to notice synchronicity. It’s fascinated humanbeings for millennia. Two thousand years ago, the father of modern medicine,Hippocrates, observed, “There is one common flow, one common breathing, allthings are in sympathy. The whole organism and each one of its parts are workingin conjunction for the same purpose. . . . The great principle extends to theextremist part, and from the extremist part it returns to the great principle,to the one nature, being and not-being” (Jung, 1952). Roman emperor andphilosopher Marcus Aurelius believed, “Everything is connected and the web isholy.”In the early 20th century, the great Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung becameintrigued by the phenomenon of synchronicity. He defined it as “a meaningfulcoincidence of two or more events, where something other than the probability ofchance is involved” (Jung, 1952, p. 79).One of his most quoted examples of synchronicity occurred during a therapysession. A young woman who was a patient of Jung’s but who was not makingprogress in her therapy recounted a dream. In it she saw a piece of jewelryshaped like a golden scarab beetle. In ancient Egyptian cosmology, scarabs arethe symbol of rebirth.While they were discussing the dream, Jung heard a rapping at the window.Opening it to investigate, he found a beetle of the scarab family. He gave it tothe woman, a symbol of her potential to move past her obstacles and renew herlife. Jung wrote, “Synchronicity reveals the meaningful connections between thesubjective and objective world.”Albert Einstein was a frequent guest at Jung’s house during the time he wasdeveloping his theory of relativity. Their conversations about the relativity oftime and space played a role in the development of Jung’s concepts ofsynchronicity. Einstein quipped, “Synchronicity is God’s way of remaininganonymous.”SYNCHRONICITY AND DREAMSDreams are often harbingers of synchronicity. Jung analyzed his patients’dreams, paying particular attention to the symbols they contained. He looked forconnections between dream images and waking life, like the scarab beetle. Theseturn up with surprising frequency.Dreams can change the course of our lives. They’re often filled with symbols andevents that contain synchronous links to the real-life challenges we face. Theygive meaning to our experience and can provide information far beyond theabilities of the waking mind.One category of synchronous dreams are those that carry information about ourhealth. In dreams, people often gain knowledge about their bodies thattranscends the scope of ordinary consciousness.Radiologist Larry Burk, M.D., has been collecting and studying breast cancerdreams for years. Analyzing stories from women around the world, he finds thatmany of these dreams are life-changing experiences (Burk, 2015). They also sharecommon characteristics. Among these are that the dreamer senses that the dreamis important (94 percent of cases). In 83 percent of cases, the dream is moreintense and vivid than other dreams. Most dreamers experience a feeling ofdread, and in 44 percent of cases, the words cancer or tumor appear.In over half the cases Dr. Burk has collected, the dream resulted in the womanseeking medical consultation. Dreams led directly to diagnosis and frequentlyhighlighted the precise location of the tumors.THE DEBRIS HIDDEN UNDER THE LEDGEOne of the participants in Dr. Burk’s study is named Wanda Burch. She had aseries of dreams about a tumor and followed up by getting a physical exam andmammogram. Neither definitively showed the existence of a tumor. Her physician,Dr. Barlyn, was an open-minded clinician and willing to consider her story. Asshe tells it:“Dr. Barlyn listened to my dream and handed me a felt-tip marker. ‘Draw thelocation on your breast.’ I drew a dot far underneath the right side of the leftbreast and told him that another dream had shown me a ledge, with the ‘dreamdebris’—or tumor—hidden underneath the ledge. Dr. Barlyn inserted the biopsyneedle in the area I designated and felt resistance, an indication of a problem.The surgical biopsy gave Dr. Barlyn the details of a fast-moving, extremelyaggressive breast cancer whose cells were not massing in a fashion that allowedthem to be seen on a mammogram.”This led Wanda to successful treatment and to sharing her story with other womenin the form of a book called She Who Dreams (Burch, 2003).A friend of Dr. Burk’s was not as fortunate in her interaction with her doctor.Sonia Lee-Shield had a warning dream and described her symptoms during aconsultation:“I had a dream that I had cancer. I went to the G.P. complaining of a lump andspasm-like feelings on my sternum. The G.P. concluded it was normal breasttissue, and the feeling in my sternum was dismissed, a devastating mistake. Ayear later, a different doctor diagnosed stage 3 breast cancer.”At that late stage, treatment was unsuccessful, and Sonia did not survive. Hertragedy gave Dr. Burk the impetus he needed to publicize the importance ofsynchronous warning dreams. He has found cases in which the diagnosis of manyother types of cancer was preceded by dreams. These include skin, lung, brain,prostate, and colon cancers (Burk, 2015).image [images/p243.jpg]Dreams are filled with symbolism uniquely meaningful to the dreamer.The dreams of cancer patients like Wanda and Sonia demonstrate the intricatedance of mind and matter. Consciousness, speaking to the mind in dreams,highlights problems in the body. It not only shows that a problem exists, but itcan also pinpoint exactly where the problem is. Consciousness is able to presentrefined levels of information beyond the most sophisticated scans andinstruments available to modern medicine.Dreams don’t just warn us of malfunctions in our bodies and our lives. They canalso play a role in healing. There are many accounts of people who’ve had dreamsin which they healed their bodies or facilitated healing for others. The dreammessages were corroborated by subsequent medical diagnoses. The following casehistory describes a dream a therapist had about her client. It comes from aprovocative collection of stories called Dreams That Change Our Lives (Hoss &Gongloff, 2017).MOTHER MARY AND THE ORBSBy Carol WarnerI was seeing a client and her daughter, whom I will call Jennifer. Jennifer hadbeen brutally beaten and sexually abused by a male relative who had been livingwith them. She had not disclosed this early on because he had repeatedlythreatened to kill her mother and her. When, after many years, she did disclose,the man was arrested but then acquitted. Inexplicably, the judge blamed themother.Jennifer entered into a downward spiral. She ended up in a relationship thatreplicated her years of beatings; she got into drugs, ran away, worked at astrip club, and was raped again. Jennifer was emotionally unreachable, and hermom’s grief was enormous.After some time, her mom moved to another city to start a business, so we nolonger met for sessions, but one day she called and said Jennifer had asked toreturn home. She said she was ready to start her life over and “face her past.”Mother wisely insisted on therapy as a condition of Jennifer’s return home.Jennifer said she only trusted me—and I lived three hours away!Since Jennifer had lost her driver’s license, her mother, in an extraordinaryoffer, agreed to take one day off her job weekly to drive Jennifer the six-hourround trip to my office to see me. In our first meeting, I asked Jennifer if shehad received a gynecological exam. She had never had one. I strongly encouragedJennifer to see a gynecologist for a thorough exam.In our next meeting, Jennifer and her mom came together to my office,long-faced, with very sad news. A biopsy revealed several large spots of ovariancancer, a cancer with a very poor prognosis.Shocked, Jennifer went for a second opinion. This gynecologist said she couldeasily see three large spots of cancer on Jennifer’s ovaries. The second biopsyalso revealed cancer. The prognosis was terminal. Jennifer’s estimated life spanwas now only six months. Mother and daughter were devastated.Jennifer commented how “my life has been shit” and how ironic it was that nowthat she was making a fresh start, she would likely die. Her mother washeartbroken, and felt hopeless and helpless. I, too, was stunned and extremelysaddened. I had a heartfelt connection with them.That night I included Jennifer and her mom in my prayers. I asked God to helpthem. During the middle of the night, I had the following dream:Mary, mother of Jesus, is descending from the sky. She is luminous, glowing,surrounded by the most beautiful ethereal blue light imaginable. As she floatsdown toward me, I see that she is dressed in a beautiful blue gown, perhaps withgold specks in it. She emanates an incredible aura of peace and love. As I watchMary, her arms are outstretched, and three glowing globes of golden-white lightissue forth from her hands. Somehow, I have the knowledge that each of theglobes of light goes to one of the three cancerous spots on Jennifer’s ovaries.I watch as each globe surrounds a spot completely and envelops it. As I watchthis amazing sight, I awaken with absolute certainty that Jennifer is nowtotally healed of her cancer.I experienced this absolute certainty both in the dream and upon wakening. Asthe day went on, I thought often about the dream. In my day consciousness, I washaving doubts. I wondered whether to tell Jennifer the dream. I did not wish togive her false hope. I decided to tell her, while cautioning that I did not knowwhat the dream meant. It seemed to me I had no right to keep this dream fromJennifer, since it was about a visitation from Mary to Jennifer.When I spoke next with Jennifer, her eyes grew wide as I told her the dream.Despite my cautions, she said she knew it was true, that Mary healed her.Jennifer went back to the same doctor who had told her the spots were visible.The doctor expressed disbelief that just one week later, there was nowabsolutely no trace of cancer. Two repeat biopsies verified that the cancer wasgone. We were all thrilled and awed at what had happened. Fifteen years later,she is cancer-free.It is not surprising that dreams can play a role in healing. The most vividdreams occur in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. In this state, our eyes aremoving around rapidly, just as they might do while we’re looking at things whenwe’re awake.The dominant brain wave frequency in the REM dreaming state is theta. Theta isalso observed in the brains of healers at the height of the healing experience(Oschman, 2015). The EEG frequency window of healing corresponds with that ofdreaming. In both dreams and healing, the brain is in a theta state. Brain andconsciousness are sharing an experience, one measured in matter, the other inmind.PRECOGNITION AND THE ARROW OF TIMEAnother anomalous experience that has been extensively studied is precognition,the ability to sense events before they occur. While there are over 100 studiesof precognition, a series of decisive experiments was carried out by Daryl Bem.Bem used standard psychological tests, such as giving students a long list ofwords and asking them to remember as many as possible. Later, words wererandomly selected from the list and given to the students to type out. Theirrecollection of the typed words was compared to their recall of those theyweren’t asked to type. They had significantly better recollection of words theywere later asked to type.Another experiment showed two curtains on a computer screen. In a series of 36trials, students were told that an erotic image was behind one of the curtainsand asked to guess which one it was. Chance would have dictated a 50 percentprobability of success, but they scored 53.1 percent, significantly abovechance.Bem’s meticulously designed and conducted studies took 10 years to complete andinvolved a large sample of over 1,000 participants. His results were echoed byan analysis of 101 studies of precognition spanning 75 years performed by DeanRadin of the Institute of Noetic Sciences (Radin, 2011). They were performed in25 different laboratories located in various countries, including the UnitedStates, Italy, Spain, Holland, Austria, Sweden, England, Scotland, Iran, Japan,and Australia. The analysis showed that 84 percent of them reportedstatistically significant results.Bem later replicated his initial work on an even larger scale (Bem, Tressoldi,Rabeyron, & Duggan, 2015). His studies produced a storm of criticism amongskeptics and those who simply couldn’t believe that precognition might exist.Human beings tend to stick firmly to their worldviews regardless of the findingsof science.Yet quantum physics does not require the arrow of time to move only in a forwarddirection. Many equations work both forward and backward. Einstein said, “Thedistinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistentillusion” (as cited in Calaprice, 2011).ATHEISTS AREN’T EXEMPTWhat we have come to call anomalous experiences, such as precognition andout-of-body states, are far from uncommon. In a poll of students at American,Chinese, and Japanese universities, many report anomalous experiences, whileover 30 percent report having them frequently (McClenon, 1993). At least 59percent had experienced déjà vu, and many described out-of-body experiences.Being religious or believing in the supernatural was not a requirement for suchexperiences: atheists and agnostics had them too. The researchers analyzedwhether believers were more prone to anomalous experiences and found that theywere not. Even famed skeptic and editor of the Skeptic magazine, MichaelShermer, described an event that shook his belief system “to the core” (Shermer,2014).THE BROKEN RADIO THAT PLAYED LOVE MUSICJune 25, 2014, was the wedding day of Michael Shermer and Jennifer Graf. She wasfrom Cologne, Germany, and had been raised by her mother and grandfather Walter.Three months before the wedding, Graf shipped her possessions to Shermer’s homein California. Many of the boxes were damaged and several heirlooms lost. Onethat arrived intact was Walter’s 1978 Philips radio, and when it was unpacked,Shermer inserted batteries and set out to “bring it back to life after decadesof muteness.”His attentions were in vain. He even opened it up to see if there were any loosewires inside that he could solder, but the radio refused to emit even static.On her wedding day, Graf was feeling lonely. Her beloved grandfather was notthere to give her away. She and Shermer walked to the back of the house, wheremusic was playing in the bedroom.They looked at their computers and phones to locate the source of the music.They even opened the back door to see if was coming from a neighbor’s house.Then Graf opened the drawer of Shermer’s desk to reveal her grandfather’s radio.It was playing a love song. The couple sat in stunned silence, broken only byGraf’s sobbing. Shermer’s daughter also heard the music.The following day, the radio fell silent, and has never worked since.In the survey of anomalous experiences, even students in the hard sciences weredisposed to them. Ethnic background didn’t make a big difference; anomalousexperiences were common in both white and black American students. As Jungobserved, “Synchronicity is an ever-present reality for those who have eyes tosee.”image [images/p248.jpg]Jung witnessed a snake swallowing a fish on the shore of the lake at Bollingenand afterward had the image carved into a rock in his garden.Jung continues to tickle us with synchronicity from beyond the grave. One of themost comprehensive texts on the subject is Synchronicity: Nature and Psyche inan Interconnected Universe by prominent Jung scholar Joseph Cambray (2009).David Rosen, editor of Cambray’s book, shares a striking synchronicity relatedto working on the text:“In my backyard there is a Japanese garden with a pond containing numerous koi.Shortly before Joseph Cambray arrived [to deliver the lectures that became thesynchronicity book], a snake caught and swallowed a koi. When I saw figure 1 of‘Jung’s carving of a snake swallowing a fish,’ I wondered if this was an exampleof synchronicity. . . . I had not observed such an event before or after thisoccurrence (Cambray, 2009).”WHAT CAN EXPLAIN SYNCHRONICITY?That synchronicity happens is well established. How it happens is anotherquestion. What could possibly be coordinating processes in so many differentdimensions of reality? How can a biological phenomenon such as the proliferationof cancer cells be linked to a state of consciousness such as a dream orpremonition?Cancer cells are matter. They are physical units inside living bodies. They growand divide at a rapid pace, exempt from the signals that cause normal cells toself-destruct when they are old or damaged. Cancer cells lose the molecularbonds on their membranes that keep them in place, allowing them to detach fromthe surrounding tissue. They then migrate to distant parts of the body. In stage3 and 4 cancers, rogue cells metastasize throughout the body. They are mattergone wild, molecular clusters on a path of self-destruction.Dreams are pure mind. They are completely subjective, with a meaning unique tothe dreamer. They are filled with images that engage our emotions and senses.They engage the full spectrum of our consciousness whenever we sleep. How can asubjective experience such as dreaming connect with an objective reality such ascell proliferation?Synchronicity ties the subjective and objective together. It connects theimmaterial world of mind and energy with the material world of matter and form.The worlds of mind and matter resonate together in the course of synchronousevents.RESONANCE IN SMALL AND LARGE SYSTEMSThere are many videos online showing pendulums coming into resonant coherence.There is a link at the end of this chapter for a video showing 64 metronomesbeing activated one after the other. At first, they all swing independently andrandomly.image [images/p250.jpg]In the first image, 32 metronomes begin ticking independently. Within threeminutes, resonance produces coherence and all the metronomes tick together.Then, slowly but surely, a remarkable change occurs. Two of the pendulums beginto swing in synchrony. A short while later, a third one joins them. The fourthone comes into coherence quicker than the third. Within three minutes, theentire collection is swinging away together, precisely in sync.This type of resonance was described in 1665 by Dutch physicist ChristiaanHuygens. Eight years earlier, he had patented the pendulum clock. Whilerecovering from an illness during which he had plenty of time to observe hissurroundings, including the two pendulum clocks in his room, he noticed an oddphenomenon: regardless of the position in which the pendulums began, they wouldslowly entrain to swinging in unison.Resonance is a property of all systems, from the very small to the infinitelylarge. At the atomic level, we find molecules with similar properties resonatingtogether (Ho, 2008). At the cellular level, cells use resonance to communicate,propagate, and heal (Oschman, 2015).Ascending the scale, we find resonance operating in organisms, from tiny onessuch as viruses to large ones such as human beings. Scaling up even bigger,resonance is found at the level of the entire planet.Getting still larger, we find resonance in “the music of the spheres,” at thelevel of solar systems, galaxies, and the universe. From the infinitesimallysmall to the unimaginably large, resonance is the song sung by matter.Not only do similar systems resonate together, they resonate with other systemsas well. The very large can resonate with the very small. Our human bodies canbe entrained by the resonance of Earth, picked up by the brain’s pineal gland,30 percent of whose molecules are metallic and hence magnetically sensitive(Oschman, 1997).FIELD LINE RESONANCESOur planet has an electromagnetic field of its own, just like a big magnet. Ithas a north and a south pole, and the lines of force generated by this enormousmagnet radiate out hundreds of thousands of miles into space.image [images/p251.jpg]The Earth’s field lines surround the planet.Imagine these lines as strings on an instrument such as a violin. When you plucka string, it resonates. In a similar way, the field lines of Earth resonate whenthey are plucked. As the solar wind sweeps by the planet at a speed of twomillion miles an hour (3 million km/h), it is constantly plucking those strings.Several common “notes” are played on Earth’s geomagnetic strings. Some of thesenotes play all the time, like a continuous chord, while others soundintermittently, like a string that is plucked occasionally. For this reason,field line resonances are divided into continuous and irregular pulsations(Jacobs, Kato, Matsushita, & Troitskaya, 1964; Anderson, Engebretson, Rounds,Zanetti, & Potemra, 1990).One of the most important continuous geomagnetic pulsations that scientistsmeasure is in the frequency window of 0.1 to 0.2 Hz. Another is in the range of0.2 to 5 Hz. Irregular pulsations in the lowest frequency range are from 0.025to 1 Hz.The lowest of Earth’s continuous geomagnetic frequencies, 0.1 Hz, is exactly thesame frequency as the rhythm of the human heart when in coherence. If wepractice a relaxation method like the Quick Coherence Technique developed by theHeartMath Institute, our heart begins to beat in coherence. In that state, ourindividual human heart is sounding the same note as the slowest of thefrequencies of Earth’s magnetic field (McCraty, 2017).The 0.1 Hz frequency also happens to be the frequency of human cardiovascularsystems. The same frequency is used by a variety of animals and even individualcells to communicate and entrain the systems that surround them, just likemetronomes in synchronous alignment.If you’ve ever held a guitar or violin on your lap while someone else wasplaying an instrument in the same room, you’ll have felt the vibration that themusic sets up. The strings and sound box of your instrument vibrate in harmonywith the instrument being played nearby, even though no one is plucking thestrings of the instrument you hold.That’s resonance. Resonance entrains objects tuned to similar frequencies evenat a distance.Certain of Earth’s field line frequencies resonate with exactly the samefrequencies that occur in the human brain and heart. As the planet plays itschords, our brains and bodies are humming along and possibly even using thatconstant music to regulate biological processes.SCHUMANN RESONANCESHave you ever blown air out of your mouth across the opening of a bottle? Itmakes a low-frequency whistling sound. Sound waves bounce back and forth betweenthe sides of the bottle, traveling through the air inside. The pitch produceddepends on the volume of the bottle.A German physicist named Winfried Schumann used mathematics to postulate that asimilar effect occurs on a global scale. In this case, the volume determiningfrequency is not that of a bottle but of the space between the surface of theplanet and the edge of the ionosphere.The ionosphere is a bubble of plasma that encircles Earth. One of the propertiesof plasma is that low-frequency magnetic waves bounce off it. Like a mirror, theinside of the plasma bubble reflects waves.That is how radio works. A signal is sent up, it bounces off the ionosphere’smirror, and it is then captured at a distant location by a person with areceiver tuned to that frequency. When magnetic pulses are introduced into thecavity between the planet’s surface and the top of the plasma bubble, some aredissipated while others aren’t. Only resonant waves propagate consistently, likethe whistle you hear when you blow across a bottle. These are the Schumannresonances.image [images/p253.jpg]Schumann resonances bounce off the plasma bubble surrounding the planet.image [images/p254.jpg]Schumann resonance data recorded from sensor site in Boulder Creek, California.Note that the frequencies correspond to those of human brain waves.In 1960, long after Schumann predicted mathematically that such waves mustexist, they were measured experimentally. The primary Schumann resonance is 7.83Hz. Harmonics are resonant multiples of the original frequency, and Schumann’swave produces harmonics at 14.3, 20.8, 27.3, and 33.8 Hz.These frequencies are also found in the waves originating in our brains as theyprocess information: 7.83 Hz is in the theta band, in the exact same frequencywindow measured in brain waves during peak healing moments (Oschman, 2015;Bengston, 2010).The next harmonic of the Schumann resonance, 14.3 Hz, is in the frequency rangeof low beta brain waves, typical of the housekeeping functions of the body. Thethird harmonic of the basic Schumann resonance, 27.3 Hz, is in the samefrequency range our brains use when we’re focused on a task and thinking hard.The harmonic of 33.8 Hz falls within the frequency range of gamma, the wavesproduced by our brains at moments of integration and insight.It’s striking that the primary resonance of Earth’s plasma sheath as well as itsharmonics fall into the same frequency windows as the primary human brain waves.Our mental states, generated by the fields our brains produce as they processinformation, resonate with the frequencies of the planet on which we live. Whenwe increase a particular wave, such as the surge of theta that accompaniesenergy healing treatments, we increase our resonance with that planetaryinformation signal. Planet and healer are entrained in an intense energeticunion.BODIES AND BRAINS ENTRAINED BY EARTH’S FREQUENCIESDr. Franz Halberg of the University of Minnesota Medical School coined the termcircadian rhythms to describe the body’s daily cycles (Halberg, Tong, & Johnson,1967). Until his death in his late 90s, he conducted research in his lab sevendays a week. In 2017, research on the genetics of the body clock won the NobelPrize in medicine.Halberg believed that the reason that the delta through gamma frequencies arepervasive in our brains and our bodies is that we evolved on planet Earth,entrained in its frequencies. Studies conducted by his Halberg ChronobiologyCenter and by other researchers have demonstrated links between Earth’s fieldlines and Schumann resonances and markers of human health (Selmaoui & Touitou,2003; Brown & Czeisler, 1992).Human emotions, behavior, health, and cognitive function are all affected bysolar and geomagnetic fields (Halberg, Cornélissen, McCraty, Czaplicki, &Al-Abdulgader, 2011). Earth’s field is hypothesized to be a “carrier ofbiologically relevant information that connects all living systems” (McCraty,2015).Rollin McCraty, director of research at HeartMath, says, “We’re all like littlecells in the bigger Earth brain—sharing information at a subtle, unseen levelthat exists between all living systems, not just humans, but animals, trees, andso on” (McCraty, 2015). Information is flowing throughout this living matrix ofthe “Earth brain,” synchronizing the activity of all life-forms, down to thelevel of cells and molecules.image [images/p255.jpg]The human brain is attuned to electromagnetic fields.The human brain, an electromagnetic organ pulsing with neural connections andimpulses, is exquisitely sensitive to electromagnetic fields: “Changes in theEarth’s magnetic field have been shown to affect human heart rhythms and havebeen associated with the following: changes in brain and nervous-systemactivity; athletic performance, memory and other tasks; synthesis of nutrientsin plants and algae; the number of reported traffic violations and accidents;mortality from heart attacks and strokes; and incidence of depression andsuicide” (HeartMath Institute, n.d.).Given the pervasiveness of these frequencies on a planetary scale and the factthat we evolved in them over the course of hundreds of millions of years, it’shardly surprising that our bodies, minds, hearts, and cells are entrained tothem.HOW ANOMALOUS EVENTS ASSEMBLE INTO SYNCHRONICITIESA team of Dutch researchers performed a systematic review of 175 studies ofbiological fields. They suggest that coherent quantum frequencies regulate theprocesses of living organisms. They found that electromagnetic fields influenceneural systems and consciousness and may represent “a universal electromagneticprinciple, that underlies the observed life-sustaining effects and also may havebeen instrumental in the creation of biological order in first life and quantumconsciousness” (Geesink & Meijer, 2016).Parallels between quantum mechanics, biological systems, and consciousness weredrawn by many of the movement’s founders, including Albert Einstein, ErwinSchrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Wolfgang Pauli, Niels Bohr, and Eugene Wigner.These pioneers perceived energy, space, time, consciousness, and matter not asseparate entities but instead as interacting in a vast synchronistic dance.Geesink and Meijer found that the human electromagnetic (EM) field “communicatesbi-directionally with a global EM field, via wave resonance [and] comprises auniversal consciousness, that experiences the sensations, perceptions, thoughtsand emotions of every conscious being in the universe” (2016, p. 106). Connectthe dots between all the scientific findings and synchronicity suddenly doesn’tseem mysterious at all.Frequencies may function as the resonators that entrain micro and macro eventsin synchronicity. Though we can’t see these frequencies, they permeate both mindand matter. We swim in them as a fish swims in water, unaware of the existenceof the fundamental fields that shape consciousness and everything in thematerial world.I believe that the intercommunication between these levels of reality provides aplausible scientific explanation for synchronicity. Multidirectionalintercommunication throughout the emosphere, psychosphere, and magnetosphereallows information to pass rapidly throughout all levels of reality, those ofboth mind and matter. Fields link us continuously, even if we are unaware oftheir existence. That linking is how all the unlikely components of anomalousevents are able to assemble into synchronicities.THE BOY WHO FLEW FOR PEACEThe 1980s were a time of huge international tension. The United States and theSoviet Union glared at each other across a vast arsenal of nuclear weapons. Ifeither fired first, the result would be mutually assured destruction, whichbears the appropriate acronym of MAD.The two empires fought proxy wars in Asia and Africa. Their European allies(NATO for the United States and the Warsaw Pact for the USSR) lived tenselytogether. Some states were split in two, such as East and West Germany. If theCold War turned hot, they would be the front lines.Any incident had the potential to set off the powder keg, and the leaders of thetwo countries maintained a hotline from one capital to the other to head offdisaster.In 1983, a South Korean airliner, flight KAL 007, was shot down by a Soviet MiGfighter. All 269 passengers on board were killed.Ronald Reagan was the U.S. president at the time. The Soviet Union was in fluxas two hardline presidents, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko, died inoffice. The youngest man to hold the job, Mikhail Gorbachev, was installed in1985.In Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986, Regan and Gorbachev met in a summit. Their goalwas to reduce the number of nuclear warheads each possessed. At the last minute,the talks collapsed.A teenager in West Germany named Matthias Rust was following the negotiationsclosely “because if there was a conflict, we all knew we would be the first tobe hit” (Dowling, 2017). Just 18 years old, Rust had been taking flying lessons,learning to fly the venerable Cessna 172. The aircraft had been designed in theearly 1950s, using pre–World War II technology such as an air-cooled engine andwings above the fuselage.Deeply affected by the failure of the peace talks, Rust hatched a plan to builda metaphorical “bridge of peace” between East and West. He booked his Cessna forthree weeks, not telling anyone what he planned to do. He took off from UetersenAirfield, near Hamburg, on May 13, 1989.He flew to Iceland, where he prepared for the next leg of his journey. Hevisited Hofdi House, where the failed talks between Gorbachev and Reagan hadtaken place, and later reported, “It gave me motivation to continue.”He then flew to Norway and on to Finland, the country closest to the SovietUnion, and the one with the most porous border.Before he took off again, on May 28, he filed a flight plan with theauthorities, telling them he was bound for Stockholm, Sweden. But after leavingthe air traffic control zone, he turned off the plane’s transponder, the devicethat allows any plane to be tracked, and headed for the Soviet border.Soon he was spotted by Soviet radar in Latvia. As he approached the border, heentered the air above the most sophisticated air defense system in the world.Missiles and fighter planes stood ready to repel attackers 24/7. The fleetincluded extraordinary craft such as the MiG-25, which can fly nearly threetimes the speed of sound, and the largest fighter plane ever constructed, theTu-128, which fires missiles 17 feet (5m) in length and is the size of a WorldWar II bomber.The day of Rust’s flight happened to be Border Guards Day, a national holiday onwhich most of the men guarding the border were off on vacation.Nonetheless, radar detected Rust’s plane and directed MiG fighters in close toidentify it visually, since its transponder was not responding. They reportedthat it was a Yak-12, a Soviet training plane that looked similar to the Cessna172. Clouds then concealed Rust’s whereabouts, but the next wave of MiGs spottedhim again. One pilot flew in close, then reported to headquarters that theaircraft was actually a West German intruder.Upstream in the command chain, that pilot’s superiors were convinced that thepilot was mistaken: how could a West German plane have made it all the wayacross the border?Because of the negative publicity from the attack on KAL 007, Soviet commanderswere cautious. They wanted the order to shoot Rust down to come from the highestlevel, in this case Defense Minister Sergei Sokolov.Other ground commanders still believed that Rust’s plane was a Yak-12, and nearMoscow he entered an air control zone in which Yak-12 pilots were training intheir aircraft.To navigate, Rust had only simple maps he’d purchased off the shelf in WestGermany. Late in the day, he identified Moscow. After seeing the onion domes ofSaint Basil’s Cathedral, he scouted for a safe place to land.He found a clear runway on the eight-lane Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge,connecting Red Square with the districts to the south of the city. Normally, thebridge was a tramway route, but that morning one section of cables had beenremoved for maintenance. There was just enough room for him to land.After Rust touched down, Muscovites surrounded the plane. Everyone was friendly.A British doctor, Robin Stott, had just decided to get some fresh air and walkedout of his hotel for an evening stroll, taking his video camera with him.Hearing the noise of the plane’s engine, he pointed his lens at the sky in timeto video the landing and its aftermath. KGB agents arrived but stood aroundtalking to each other, unsure of what to do next.They eventually detained Rust and took his Cessna to a nearby airport forexamination; no one could believe that a teenager had just penetrated the airdefense system of the mighty Soviet Union. After nearly a year in jail, Rust wasreturned to West Germany.The military confusion that facilitated Rust’s flight gave Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev an excuse to get rid of hardliners who opposed his reforms, includingSokolov. Gorbachev’s reforms, such as the economic revolution called perestroikaand the opening of society called glasnost, gained momentum. The Soviet Unioncollapsed three years later.image [images/p260.jpg]Rust’s Cessna is now on display in a German museum.Matthias Rust could never have known what the full effects of his action on theconsciousness of other people would be. He just followed his vision and made apersonal statement so dramatic that the world took notice. He never flew a planeagain.Rust’s story is an example of how the personal and the global come together.Global stories are often dramatized by personal stories. Like the man standingin front of the tank during the Tiananmen Square protests in China the same yearas Rust’s flight, one individual’s actions often highlight momentous events.Huge information fields involving millions of people can come into focus throughthe lens of a single person.Notice how many synchronicities had to be in place for Rust’s trip: * Most of the men normally guarding the Soviet border were off duty, celebrating Border Guards Day. * The first Soviet fighters to spot Rust’s plane took it for a Soviet training plane. * Low clouds obscured most of Rust’s journey. * The Soviet pilot who correctly identified his plane as a West German aircraft was not believed by his superiors. * The Soviet authorities were cautious because of the huge negative publicity recently generated by shooting down a South Korean civilian airliner. * The defense minister, Sergei Sokolov, was unavailable because he was attending a high-level meeting. * Ground controllers assumed Rust’s was a Soviet training plane whose transponder had malfunctioned. * Rust accidentally flew over a training range where similar aircraft were practicing. * The tram cables spanning the bridge on which Rust landed had been removed that morning for maintenance. * Peace activist Dr. Robin Stott had decided to walk outside to get some fresh air just before Rust landed. * Stott happened to take his video camera with him. * Stott heard the sound of the plane’s engine and was able to train his camera in the right direction just before it landed.At pivotal moments in history, synchronicities can abound. Many highly unlikelyevents stack up, one on top of the other, which nudge the future in a certaindirection. As we read the accounts of great social, political, or militarychanges, they’re often laced with huge numbers of improbable synchronous events.Though we perceive the world as stable, it is actually changing rapidly. Ofthose companies that were in the Fortune 500 list of the world’s largestcompanies in 1950, only 10 percent appear there today. Even the best-organizedand most information-rich organizations in the world aren’t usually able tomaintain their positions as the cosmos swirls and changes around them.SPONTANEOUS SYNCHRONIZED ORDER IN NATURECornell University mathematician Steven Strogatz says that a tendency towardspontaneous synchronized order is a primary characteristic of nature, from thesubatomic scale to the most distant reaches of the universe (Strogatz, 2012).From inanimate molecules to complex living systems, spontaneously arising ordermay be a fundamental tendency in all of nature.Strogatz points to examples such as the synchronization of schools of fish,flocks of birds, and the internal clocks of the human body. He even shows howwaves of movement propagate through flocks of birds and schools of fish. There’sno leader, master plan, or supercomputer coordinating these millions ofintricate movements. Organization arises spontaneously from within the flock,herd, or cell, synchronized by nature.image [images/p262.jpg]Flocks of birds move in spontaneous synchrony.Strogatz notes that spontaneous order arises at every level of the universe,from the smallest to the largest. It extends from superconductivity in elementsto the nuclei of individual cells, to the flashing tails of fireflies, to thetissue that signals our hearts to pump, to traffic patterns, and to the farthestedges of the cosmos. The clock genes in the human body entrain with the diurnalcycle of the planet and even with the bodies of other human beings nearby.Spontaneously arising order is also evident in the functioning of our cells.Each cell undergoes some 100,000 metabolic processes per second. Groups ofmillions of cells, sometimes in distant regions of the body, coordinate theiractivities. They use fields to do this.Fields are a far more efficient method of coordination than chemical ormechanical signaling. If you are walking up to your locked car and want tounlock the door, you can insert the key in the lock and turn it. That’s themechanical approach to getting the job done. But it’s much faster to press thebutton on your remote and use the field approach instead.Our bodies communicate through fields in a similar way.Strogatz uses many examples of resonance drawn from human behavior, includingfads, mobs, and stock trading. One of his examples is the unexpected saga ofLondon’s Millennium Bridge.THE MILLENNIUM BRIDGEThe Millennium Bridge over the Thames River was intended to be a marvel. Openedon June 10, 2000, it was the first crossing to be constructed over the venerableriver in a century.The bridge’s designers extolled it as “a pure expression of engineeringstructure,” comparing its sleek lines to a blade of light. Engineers called it“an absolute statement of our capabilities at the beginning of the 21stcentury.” At the opening ceremony, thousands of enthusiastic spectators swarmedall over the bridge.Then something unexpected happened. The bridge began to sway slightly from sideto side.The wobble became more pronounced. Pedestrians didn’t know what to do. Theybegan to walk with wide strides to counteract the bridge’s motion. Likeentrained pendulums, they stepped to the left and then to the right.The wobble increased, and the people scrambled off the bridge as soon as theycould. It was closed immediately.Why did the bridge fail, after the brightest design and engineering minds in theworld had done their utmost to make it perfect?When they first felt the first tiny sway, the pedestrians on the bridge adjustedtheir behavior to compensate. This unintentionally brought them into resonance.They began to walk together, exacerbating the movement of the bridge.In an example of what scientists call emergent systems, there was no plan orleader guiding the Millennium Bridge wobble. It took place as an emergentresponse to resonance.The bridge’s problems were soon solved by installing dampers to cushion thebridge’s movement, and the bridge reopened. But the event remains an example ofhow resonance can trigger unexpected consequences in complex systems.image [images/p264.jpg]The Millennium Bridge.JUNG, EMERGENT PROPERTIES, AND SELF-ORGANIZATIONOne of the first scientists to study self-organizing systems was Nobel laureateIlya Prigogine. He explored ways in which order can emerge out of apparentchaos. His work contributed to the establishment of the Santa Fe Institute,which studies complexity and chaos theory.One branch of the Santa Fe Institute’s work examines systems that haveself-organizing features, also known as emergent properties. They are termedemergent because they don’t originate within the systems themselves but arestimulated by forces in the external environment. In the book Emergence: TheConnected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software, researcher StephenJohnson writes, “In these systems, agents residing on one scale start producingbehavior that lies one scale above them. . . . The movement from low-level rulesto higher-level sophistication is what we call emergence” (Johnson, 2002, p.18).There are five characteristics of emergent structures (Corning, 2002). They are: * Radical novelty: they spontaneously develop new features. * Coherence: they maintain themselves over a period of time. * Higher holistic order: they exhibit the property of wholeness. * Dynamic process: they evolve. * Apparent: they can be perceived.One example of emergence is the evolution of distinct neighborhoods in largecities. Like-minded people get together and organize the businesses, socialclubs, schools, and religious institutions most relevant to them. The process isorganic and bottom-up, resisting the top-down control systems of zoning laws andplanning commissions.These types of “emergent intelligence” organize without consciousness and inresponse to changing stimuli. Assimilating and responding to information,emergent systems adapt and self-organize into new patterns. Physicist DoyneFarmer said: “It’s not magic, but it feels like magic” (Corning, 2002).A Nova Science television program on emergence uses the example of an antcolony: “Ants are not mental giants, and they can’t see the big picture. Yet outof their simple behaviors—follow the strongest pheromone trail, say, or save thequeen at all costs when under attack—arises a classic example of emergence: theant colony. The colony exhibits an extraordinary ability to explore and exploitits surroundings. It is aware of and reacts to food sources, floods, enemies,and other phenomena, over a substantial piece of ground. Each ant dies afterdays or months, but the colony survives for years, becoming more stable andorganized over time” (Nova, 2007).image [images/p266.jpg]Ants provide an example of emergent behavior.Jung’s concept of synchronicity represents an application of the idea ofself-organizing systems to psychology. Synchronicity incorporates emergentproperties of personal experience, brain, fields, and environment (Hogenson,2004). Jungian researcher Joseph Cambray says that “Emergent phenomena,especially in the human realm, can appear to ordinary, individual consciousnessas meaningful, if inexplicable, coincidences. . . . Synchronicities can beexplored as a form of emergence of the Self and have a central role inindividuation or psychological maturation” (Cambray, 2002).Members of the Santa Fe Institute argue that self-organizing systems may be asimportant in evolution as natural selection: “Life and its evolution have alwaysdepended on the mutual embrace of spontaneous order and [natural] selection’scrafting of that order” (Kaufman, 1993).In 1959, Jung wrote a letter to his friend Erich Neumann, observing, “In thischaos of chance, synchronistic phenomena were probably at work, operating bothwith and against the known laws of nature to produce, in archetypal moments,syntheses which appear to us miraculous. . . . This presupposes not only anall-pervading, latent meaning which can be recognized by consciousness, butduring that preconscious time, a psychological process with which a physicalevent meaningfully coincides” (Jung, 1975).Cambray concludes that “Meaningful coincidences are psychological analogues thatspur the evolution of both the personal and the collective psyche, organizingimages and experiences into previously unimagined forms” (Cambray, 2009).Synchronicities are part of how we grow and evolve as people, as societies, andas a species.SEPTEMBER 11 SYNCHRONICITIESLike most people, I remember where I was on September 11, 2001. I was living ina cottage in Guerneville, California, with my two young children. My ex-wife,knowing I don’t watch TV, phoned and told me to turn it on. Horrified, I watchedas the second jet crashed into the towers and they collapsed. Along withmillions of others, I felt as though the world as we knew it had come crashingdown too.Estimates of those killed in the towers exceeded 6,000. That number was arrivedat by reporters who calculated how many people would normally be working in thetwo towers at 8:46 A.M., when the first jet hit. The official estimate from theNew York Police Department almost two weeks later, after the dust had settled,was 6,659 dead.However, as the months went by and the story kept unfolding, the numbers keptdropping. The final death toll was 2,753. That’s less than half the initialestimate. What explains such a huge disparity between the numbers?Part of the answer is that the evacuation efforts were largely successful. Mostof those who worked below the impact points managed to escape. Yet there weremany more who were supposed to be at their desks above the impact points thatmorning but were not. Where were they?According to a careful analysis of this question by USA Today, “Many companiesdid head counts after the attack. . . . Counts from more than 50 floors indicatethe buildings were barely half full” (Cauchon, 2001). Where were the missingpeople?There are many reasons why people weren’t in the World Trade Center thatmorning. When talking to survivors, some describe having been warned byintuition, dreams, or precognition. Others experienced unexpected delays due tocrowded trains or family problems.Rebeka Javanshir-Wong is one of our energy psychology practitioners. Her husbandis one of those who was absent when the planes hit. Here’s how she tells thestory:“My husband, who worked at Tower 2, also had an out-of-routine day when he wentto work later than usual and was on his way to the office when the planescrashed.“His company had invited two of their young employees from Malaysia to come fortraining. They had arrived the night before, and since it was their first timein the U.S., my husband, along with other colleagues, had taken them out todinner and helped them settle in an apartment the company had rented for themnear the Twin Towers. Knowing that these two had big jet lag, they all decidedto start work a little later the next morning and give them time to rest.”The delay saved all their lives.Celebrities often make their schedules public, so their comings and goings areeasy to track. There are many stories of well-known people who weren’t at theWorld Trade Center that morning as scheduled. Among them are these: * Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, was scheduled to be on the 101st floor for a charity event. She ran late and was still doing an interview in the NBC television studio at 8:46 A.M. when the first plane hit. * With a group of friends, actor Mark Wahlberg was due to fly on American Airlines flight 11. They changed their plans and, at the last minute, chartered their own plane. * Actor and producer Seth McFarlane was also booked on American Airlines flight 11. His travel agent gave him the wrong takeoff time and he arrived at the gate after it had closed. * Actress Julie Stoffer had a fight with her boyfriend and missed the same plane. * Michael Lomonaco, head chef of the restaurant at the top of the towers, Windows on the World, was heading up to his office half an hour before the first plane hit. He had a noon appointment to have his glasses fixed at the optometry store in the lobby, and he decided to go back down again to see if they could fit him in early. The half-hour delay saved his life. * The developer who held the lease on the World Trade Center, Larry Silverstein, had a dermatology appointment that morning. He had decided to skip the appointment and go to work, but his wife persuaded him to visit the doctor instead. * Olympic swimmer Ian Thorpe was out for a jog that he planned to end at the observation deck on the World Trade Center. He realized he’d forgotten his camera and returned to his hotel room. When he turned on his TV, he saw the north tower on fire. * Corporate director Jim Pierce was due to attend a meeting on the 105th floor of the south tower. But by the evening before, the organizers realized that there were too many people in the group to fit in the meeting room, so they switched the venue to the Millennium Hotel across the street. Pierce later learned that 11 of the 12 people who’d been in the original conference room died in the tragedy. * Lara Lundstrom was rollerblading down a street in lower Manhattan when she realized that the driver of a silver Mercedes SUV stopped at a light was actress Gwyneth Paltrow. Lara stopped to talk for a few minutes. This resulted in her missing her train to the south tower and her absence in her office on the 77th floor.Sometimes small synchronicities—the forgotten camera, jet lag, the chancemeeting with an actress, the eyeglasses repair—have a disproportionate effect onour lives. Big events like 9/11 seem to spawn many synchronicities—or perhaps wejust notice them when they’re dramatized by a global event.SYNCHRONICITY IS SCIENCESynchronicity, which seems to be so mysterious when we first encounter it, turnsout to have solid scientific explanations behind it. Spontaneous order arises inliving systems, from the atom to the galaxy. Our brains are attuned to the samefrequencies as the planet on which we live. In altered states of consciousnesssuch as dreams, trance, meditation, hypnosis, and epiphany, we enjoy access to anonlocal information field that extends far beyond our local senses.Fields permeate the cosmos, including our planet and our bodies. When resonanceis established between macro and micro, such as between a Schumann and brainwave frequency, the macro and the micro can fire in coherence. Bodies entrain tofields, and two-way intercommunication occurs between them. Information flowsbetween all levels of reality, including both mind and matter, permeating theemosphere, psychosphere, and magnetosphere. That’s how all the seeminglymysterious parts of synchronous events are able to come together.image [images/p270.jpg]The psychosphere.The great scientists of the early quantum age in the first part of the 20thcentury were aware of the great fields in which our local human minds operate.Einstein said: “Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of sciencebecomes convinced that some spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe, onethat is vastly superior to that of man” (as cited in Calaprice, 2002).Max Planck, a founding father of quantum physics, said: “All matter originatesand exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particles of an atom tovibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. . . . Wemust assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent Mind.This Mind is the matrix of all matter” (as translated in Braden, 2008). Thedeeper scientists delve into the workings of matter, from subatomic particles tothe enormous scale of galaxies, the more they notice the synchronouscoordination present in the whole.BRAIN AS TRANSDUCER OF UNIVERSAL FIELDThe view of skeptics and materialists is that the mind is in the brain: “Mind iswhat brain does.” Mind is believed to be an epiphenomenon of brain, aconsequence of brain. As brains evolved, becoming larger and more complex, goesthis theory, they gave rise to mind. When enough neurons fire together, theyproduce this artifact called consciousness. Sir Francis Crick, the co-discovererof the double helix structure of DNA, summed up this proposition with the words:“A person’s mental activities are entirely due to the behavior of nerve cells,glial cells, and the atoms, ions, and molecules that make up and influence them”(Crick & Clark, 1994).image [images/p271.jpg]The theory that the complex brain gives rise to consciousness is unsupported byscience.There is no proof supporting the theory that consciousness lives inside thebrain. A review by the Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies notes,“Brain-centered theories of consciousness seem to face insuperable difficulties”(Tonneau, 2004). Despite the lack of evidence at present, however, materialistskeptics assure us that science will eventually fill in the gaps.Nobel Prize–winning neurophysiologist Sir John Eccles called this “promissorymaterialism.” He regarded it as “a superstition without a rational foundation .. . a religious belief held by dogmatic materialists . . . who confuse theirreligion with their science. It has all the features of a messianic prophecy”(as cited in Dossey, 2009).There is, on the other hand, plenty of evidence that consciousness existsoutside the brain. The mind does not behave as though it is confined to thebrain, and there are many experiences of nonlocal consciousness that cannot beexplained by a local mind trapped inside the confines of the human skull.CONSCIOUSNESS BEYOND THE BORDERS OF THE SENSESIn altered states, our consciousness is able to go far beyond the borders of oursenses and obtain information that comes from far beyond our local minds. In thepast few decades, dozens of scientific papers studying altered states such asnear-death experiences (NDEs) and out-of-body experiences (OBEs) have beenpublished (Facco & Agrillo, 2012). While people who are medically dead canexperience NDEs, in 37 percent of NDE cases, the person was not close to death(Clark, 2012).These experiences have some characteristics in common. People having OBEs andNDEs report a sense of having actually left their physical body. They have fulluse of their senses, which are often greatly enhanced. They have freedom ofmovement and a sense of well-being. They can see things that would normally notbe visible to them, such as objects on top of cabinets in the operating room oron the rooftops of nearby buildings, or family members not present in the room.They may know the thoughts of those present in the room with them or reportprecise details of conversations that occurred when they were under generalanesthesia.image [images/p273.jpg]Having an out-of-body or near-death experience changes people.Once people come back from an OBE or NDE, they are changed. They are not afraidof death, and they believe in a loving and compassionate universe. They have asense of certainty about what they perceived.Dr. Mario Beauregard, author of Brain Wars, believes that the function of thebrain is to act as a filter. The consciousness of each person exists in thisall-knowing state of infinite perception, which is characteristic of OBEs andNDEs. That infinite mind is then filtered by the brain into a manageableexperience in order to exist in a physical body (Beauregard, 2012).Dr. Kenneth Ring and Sharon Cooper performed a study examining the NDEs ofpeople who have been blind from birth (Ring & Cooper, 2008). The results offerparticularly compelling evidence of the existence of consciousness beyond thebody, because these people have never been able to see. Unlike sighted peoplehaving NDEs who are describing objects and people they have witnessed before,blind people have no such frame of reference.THE BLIND WOMAN WHO SAWDuring their NDEs, blind people have been able to describe details of objectsthey have never seen. One such experiencer was a 45-year-old woman named VickiUmipeg, whose optic nerve had been destroyed at birth by an overdose of oxygen.She reported, “I don’t see anything, not even in my dreams, not even black.”After a car accident, she was taken to the emergency room. She found herawareness floating above her body: “I found myself in the hospital looking downat what was happening, frightened since I had never ‘seen’ before.” Vicki wasdisoriented and had difficulty recognizing that the body she was staring down atwas hers: “I knew that it was mine because I wasn’t in mine.”Vicki was later able to describe the doctor and nurse who were working on herunconscious body, as well as their words: “They kept saying, ‘We can’t bring herback.’ I felt very detached from my body and couldn’t understand why they wereupset. I went up through the ceiling hearing beautiful sounds of wind chimes.Where I was I could see trees, birds, and people but all made of light. I wasoverwhelmed because I couldn’t imagine what light was like. It was like a placewhere all knowledge was. I was then sent back and into my body in excruciatingpain.”Vicki was also able to describe details of objects she had never been able tosee, such as the patterns on her rings: “I think I was wearing the plain goldband on my right ring finger and my father’s wedding ring next to it. But mywedding ring I definitely saw. . . . That was the one I noticed the most becauseit’s most unusual. It has orange blossoms on the corners of it.” Vicki latersaid that this experience was “the only time I could ever relate to seeing andto what light was, because I experienced it.”Thirteen hundred years ago, the Tibetan Book of the Dead described states ofnonlocal consciousness. In a place suspended between life and death called thebardo state, the bardo body is able to perceive the world without the mediationof the senses. It can move through solid objects and travel to any place in thecosmos instantly, just like the consciousness described by people having OBEsand NDEs.Indian Vedic philosophy holds that the great nonlocal universal consciousness isreflected in each of us. The analogy is that of buckets of water in which thesun is reflected. Though there are many different buckets, it is the same sunreflecting in all of them.image [images/p275.jpg]Shamans were believed to move between the local and nonlocal world.Only in recent times has the belief arisen that nonlocal consciousness is“paranormal” or “psychic” and that study of these phenomena is off-limits toconventional science. For most of the thousands of years of human history, theholy person or shaman was a special member of the tribe. Such people werebelieved to “travel between the worlds” of local awareness and nonlocal mind,bringing back wisdom and healing from realms beyond those of ordinaryconsciousness (Eliade, 1964).Shamans were able to commune with animals and beings outside of local awarenessand were often gifted with dreams and visions that conveyed meaning from thenonlocal universe. Only recently have altered states such as those experiencedin dreams, mystical ecstasy, oneness with nature, NDEs, and OBEs come to beregarded as anything other than a normal part of human experience.NDEs and OBEs can be transformative. John is a gay African American man with anadvanced degree, but after being diagnosed with AIDS, he hit rock bottom. Then,while participating in a study of AIDS patients, he found himself transcendingpreoccupation with his own suffering and helping a drunk white man who was indistress. Right afterward, he had an OBE. Here’s how he describes the experience(Church, 2013).NO ONE HAS A MONOPOLY ON GOD“I felt like I was floating over my body, and I’ll never forget this, as I wasfloating over my body, I looked down, it was like this shriveled-up prune,nothing but a prune, like an old dried skin. And my soul, my spirit was over mybody. Everything was so separated. I was just feeling like I was in differentdimensions, I felt it in my body like a gush of wind blows. I remember saying toGod, ‘God! I can’t die now, because I haven’t fulfilled my purpose,’ and, justas I said that, the spirit and the body became one, it all collided, and I couldfeel this gush of wind and I was a whole person again.“That was really a groundbreaking experience. Before becoming HIV-positive, myfaith was so fear based. I always wanted to feel I belonged somewhere, that Ifit in, or that I was loved. What helped me to overcome the fear of God and thefear of change was that I realized that no one had a monopoly on God. I was ableto begin to replace a lot of destructive behavior with a sort of spiritualdesire. I think also what changed [was] my desire to get close to God, to lovemyself, and to really embrace unconditional love.”The study of AIDS patients found that those who believed in a loving God orbenevolent universe had much better health outcomes than those who believed in apunishing one (Ironson et al., 2011). It also found that a diagnosis was oftenfollowed by a crisis leading to a spiritual breakthrough.IS THE MIND IN THE BRAIN?The mind is not in the brain any more than the picture on your computer isinside the screen.When you turn on your TV and watch Comedy Central, the show is not inside yourscreen. There is certainly a close correlation between your device and the show.If your screen has a crack in it, it won’t display the show properly. Thatdoesn’t mean that the existence of Comedy Central is dependent on your screen.The show has an existence independent of your screen and its degree offunctionality.Many experts looking at the research on brain and mind have suggested that thebrain functions in a similar way (Kelly, 2011; Dossey, 2013). It is a transducerof mind in the same way that your screen is a transducer of the signal thatcarries the show. Mind and consciousness are independent of the screen.Research shows that consciousness is not located in the brain. Dr. BruceGreyson, who performed a study of NDEs in a cardiac care unit, concludes, “Noone physiological or psychological model by itself explains all the commonfeatures of NDE. A clear sensorium and complex perceptual processes during aperiod of apparent clinical death challenge the concept that consciousness islocalized exclusively in the brain” (Greyson, 2003). Your consciousness extendsfar beyond your local self, and your brain is akin to the receiver thattranslates it into your everyday experience.In ordinary waking states, consciousness is firmly anchored to local reality.When you’re driving to work or watching your child’s baseball game or walkingyour dog or filling out your tax returns, your mind is focused on local reality.What you perceive as “you” is driving the car, looking at the traffic, andnoticing the surrounding vehicles. Nonlocal fields are still there, but yourmind isn’t tuned in to them.image [images/p277.jpg]In anomalous states, we’re no longer bound by local reality.During times of anomalous states, such as dreaming, trance, meditation, mysticalecstasy, or hypnosis, our consciousness is no longer tethered to local reality.We lose identification with our bodies and our local sense of self. Like soulsin the bardo state, we can move instantly to distant parts of the universe,unconfined by the constraints of local reality.Some anomalous states are unremarkable regular experiences, like our nightlydreams. Others are transcendent experiences, like the oneness with nature wemight experience during a mindful moment deep in the woods or splashing our toesin the ocean. At such times, our sense of a local self falls away and we feelone with all that is. In a mystical state, the boundaries of local selfdissolve, and we become one with the universe.THE BRAIN AS BRIDGE BETWEEN LOCAL AND NONLOCAL REALITYThe brain is also capable of bridging local and nonlocal reality. As well asproviding the biological anchor through which we participate in nonlocal mind,it is constantly processing information from our surroundings.This information flow is a two-way street. If we’re lost in a daydream, ourconsciousness far away from our body, and a car backfires outside our window,our attention is shocked immediately back into the present. If we’re in themiddle of a dream at night, traveling far beyond the limits of waking awareness,and we smell smoke, our brain alerts us to danger and brings us back to earth ina hurry.Our brain takes the information from the outside world and conveys it to ourmind.The ability of the brain to engage with and interpret the outside world is keyto our functioning as human beings. But if we devote all our attention to theoutside world and the local thoughts that cycle through our brains, we can missout on the ecstatic states available to us when we are connected to nonlocalmind. A human experience that is focused only on local awareness and phenomenais an impoverished one, partaking in only a tiny sliver of the consciousnessavailable to it.image [images/p279.jpg]The brain bridges local and nonlocal reality.Recent research has shown that large-scale fields exist around the planet andthat they both entrain human consciousness and are affected by it (McCraty &Deyle, 2016). The human brain is a plausible biological mediator between theselarge-scale nonlocal fields and individual human awareness, the bridge betweenthe local and the universal.CHOOSING THE SIGNAL TO WHICH WE ATTUNEWe can choose the frequency to which we attune our minds. Like a streaming musicservice with millions of choices of stations, there are millions of competingnonlocal signals to choose from all the time.Some of these signals are permutations of fear, while others are permutations oflove. We can choose to attune the transceiver of our local mind with any one ofthe infinite varieties available.We can choose magical experiences, orienting our awareness to them consciously.Rather than an occasional random fluke, they then become our default setting. Wecan decide to meditate when we wake up each morning, not leaving it up to chancewhether or not we feel in tune with the cosmos that day. When we’re stressed, wecan tap, restoring equilibrium to our troubled emotions and maintaining ourability to connect with a larger perspective.We can decide to go to our favorite spot in nature or listen to a piece of musicthat lifts us into a state of ecstasy. We can change the broadcast channel,turning off the news and tuning to the words and energy of an inspirationalteacher instead. We can make a conscious decision to lift our attention fromordinary local reality to the sublime nonlocal signal of the universal mind.By choosing these practices, we use our minds deliberately in order to inducetranscendent states. Such states become not an inadvertent happy accident, but alifestyle upgrade that we have deliberately installed.THE BILL ON THE BEACHIn my dream, I am giving a speech. The auditorium is dark, but in the blacknessand via live streaming, millions of people are listening intently. I’m using aPowerPoint presentation.The next-to-last slide is one of a gateway. It has a big wooden post on eitherside. In the middle hangs a yellow sign with crenellation on top. It says, “TheHappy Universe.”I tell the audience that every one of them deserves to live there. There’snothing stopping them. Well, almost nothing. I flip to my last slide.It’s a ticket that says, “Admit one.”I tell them that they have to pay for this ticket. The price of admission istheir suffering. They can’t get in if they hang on to even one atom of it. Theyhave to give up absolutely every shred of suffering to purchase the ticket. Dothat, and you’re in.The ticket only admits one person. You can’t take your loved ones in there withyou. They have to make the choice to buy a ticket themselves. Each person has togive up his or her suffering to get in, and you can’t let go of it for someoneelse.That’s the end of the dream. I awake with the images embossed on my mind.That was the dream I had the day I finished this book. Every part of the writingprocess was laced with synchronicities.The previous New Year’s Eve, my primary prayer for the year was that I be ableto enter a deep meditative state quickly. Usually, it took me a while to shedall the mental chatter, and I wanted to be able to dive right in withoutspending so much time quieting my mind.In a few weeks, this began to happen. I could invoke alignment quickly.Two months later, taking a break from a conference at which I was speaking, Itook a walk on the beach in San Diego. I was becoming obsessed with the idea ofwriting a book about the scientific evidence linking mind and matter. But Ialready had another book project half finished, too much other work, and nopublisher. There were far more reasons not to proceed with the project than togo ahead.It was a chilly winter’s day, so my wife, Christine, had decided to stay in thecar. I paced for a mile, wrestling with the book idea. I dodged children, dogs,and kites, all of which were out in force despite the cold weather. I could findno clarity, and I asked the universe for a clear sign.I didn’t receive any great epiphany, so I turned to walk back to the car. My eyecaught something at the tide line. It was a $10 bill. There was no one aroundwho it might belong to, and I picked it up.image [images/p281.jpg]The bill on the beach.I got back in the car and showed it to Christine. Like any other bill, it said,“In God We Trust.”That seemed like an appropriate though unexceptional message. But why a $10bill, rather than $1, $5, or $20?Then the association hit me. In all my work, I use a rating scale from 0 to 10.If you believe something strongly, your belief is a 10 out of 10. The symbolismseemed to indicate that I could trust the universe to proceed with this projectand it would be a 10 out of 10 grand slam.A week later, the outline had written itself. Two weeks after that, I had a talkwith Reid Tracy, the president of Hay House, who loved the idea. He preferredthe title Mind to Matter to my alternative title Thoughts to Things, so thefirst option became the book title while Thoughts to Things became the title ofmy accompanying online course.I wrote up a detailed proposal, and the day I mailed it in, a message arrived inmy e-mail inbox from Mike Dooley, another Hay House author who sends dailymessages to his subscribers. The subject line was “Thoughts become things anddreams come true.” Another synchronicity.I carved out several three-to-four-day blocks of time to write. Those days, Ifound myself wide awake at 4 A.M. I would spend an hour in meditation, gettingmy mind perfectly aligned, after which I would read and write obsessively forabout 15 hours.My friend David Feinstein gave me valuable feedback after I’d written the firstthree chapters. One morning after meditation, I had a strong urge to thank him.I decided to phone him later that morning. I hardly ever use my phone because Iprefer e-mail, and I know he travels most of the year and rarely turns on hisphone. So I knew I’d get his voicemail and be able to leave a warm message ofappreciation.I was surprised when, instead, David answered the phone. He told me he’d justreturned the day before from a trip and turned on his cell phone a few minutesbefore I called. When the call came through, the phone displayed no caller ID,and he doesn’t usually answer such calls. But he received an intuitive nudge todo so. Yet another synchronicity.When I was writing this chapter on planetary-scale effects, I was struggling tounderstand the Schumann resonances. That month, I had also inadvertentlydouble-booked myself to speak at two conferences the same weekend. One was inthe Caribbean and the other at the opposite side of the continent in California.I had to split my time by speaking at one on Saturday, then flying back toCalifornia early Sunday morning to speak at the other.Sunday afternoon, I was on a science panel at the second conference. Sittingnext to me was HeartMath research director Rollin McCraty. He had just publisheda major paper on . . . you guessed it. Besides Schumann resonances, he also toldme about field line resonances, which I had never even heard of before. Theybecame a major part of the chapter. Synchronicities abounding!Christine and I visited our friends Bob and Lynne Hoss in Arizona on the way toanother conference. Bob is an expert on the neuroscience of dreaming. He hadrecently keynoted a conference and prepared a presentation on Carl Jung, thecollective unconscious, and the double-slit experiments. His PowerPoint filledin crucial gaps in my knowledge. Synchronicity again!On the same day, Jack Canfield, John Gray, and Rick Leskowitz all e-mailed me tosay they’d endorse the book.image [images/p283.jpg]The June 12, 1982, peace rally.When the publisher gave me the official publication date, June 12, a shiver ranup my spine. That date is highly significant for me. On June 12, 1982, I was inCentral Park, New York, joining hundreds of thousands of people protestingagainst the nuclear standoff between the U.S. and the USSR. After the rally,Secretary of State George Schultz went on television to say that the rally wouldmake absolutely no difference in U.S. policy.A few months later, U.S. president Ronald Reagan made an astonishing U-turn. Themost hawkish of presidents amazed the world by proposing the START (StrategicArms Reduction Treaty) nuclear reduction talks. Every year, on the anniversaryof June 12, I remember the day when, in a powerful collective act of group mind,we decided not to blow up the planet and ourselves along with it.Finally, on the very last day I had available to complete the manuscript of thisbook, I visited a neighborhood grocery store for breakfast. Near the checkoutstand, my eye was caught by the latest special from Time magazine, entitled “TheScience of Emotions.” I opened it to a random page, and saw the headline of anarticle on how synchronicity can be predictable and not simply a matter ofchance. That piece led me to the last four studies I needed to complete thesynchronicity chapter.Each day, I begin with attunement. I know that if I begin resonating with thefields of fear and lack that are present in the psychosphere, they will absorbmy attention. Instead, I deliberately align my mind with the highestpossibilities for me and for the planet.We can choose to attune to the fields of love, peace, and joy. Like selectingthe stations on a radio dial, we can allow the instrument of our brain and bodyto play the melodies of beauty and wonder that resonate through the planetaryfield. When we align ourselves with these fields, they resonate through ourworlds, connecting us synchronistically with the highest possibilities in ourdestiny.ATTENTION BUILDS BRAINSResearch into the brains of people in elevated spiritual states tells us thatthey are processing information very differently from the way they function inordinary consciousness. The ratio of delta, beta, alpha, theta, and gamma waveschanges drastically as the brain functions in an entirely different way. Whenthese patterns of neural firing are changed on a regular basis, they quicklybegin to build new synaptic connections. The volume of the various parts of ourbrain begins to change as the matter of brain tissue reconfigures itself tomatch the mind of deliberate creation.The brain then becomes more skilled at transducing these signals. With moreneural connections to carry the information flow, the brain is better at pickingsignals up from the universal field. It’s more attuned to signaling from thefield, with a higher degree of the neural circuits that facilitate synchrony.A study performed by researchers at the University of Zurich compared people whowere making a choice about how generous to be. A sum of money was promised to 50participants at the start of the experiment. Half committed to spending themoney on themselves alone, and the other half committed to spending it onsomeone else. Both groups were then asked to make a series of decisionsindicative of generous behavior.The investigators used MRIs to measure brain activity during and after thedecision-making process. They found that participants who behaved the mostgenerously had the biggest changes in brain regions associated with happiness.The researchers were surprised that the mere intent to spend money on someoneelse, before the generous act occurred, was sufficient to trigger changes inneural patterns (Park et al., 2017).image [images/p285.jpg]Of the choices available to us each moment, where will we direct our awareness?Every moment, we’re faced with choices about where to direct our consciousness.Will we focus on the agonizing suffering with which the media tries to trap ourawareness? Or will we orient our attention to the eternal now? Will we getsucked into the petty dramas of the human condition or align our thoughts withthe wisdom of universal mind? With each choice we make, we shape our brain.Choose consistently for months and years, and you literally create a brain insynchrony with nonlocal mind.Sir John Eccles, who earned a Nobel Prize for his work on the brain’s neuralsynapses, says that “We have to recognize that we are spiritual beings withsouls existing in a spiritual world as well as material beings with bodies andbrains existing in a material world” (Popper & Eccles, 2012). When we live asthough we are spiritual beings with material bodies and orient our consciousnessin that way each day, the matter we create with our minds is very different.ENTRAINING SELF WITH SYNCHRONICITYDoes synchronicity just happen, or can we encourage it? Is it a phenomenon thatappears randomly by chance or can we step into a reality in which synchronicityis common?Rather than being just an occasional accident, synchronicity, I’ve found, is astate that can be cultivated. We can deliberately entrain our local minds to thenonlocal consciousness of the universe in which the spontaneous coordination ofnature is ever present. With practice, living synchronously and in harmony withthe unfolding patterns of the universe becomes our minds’ default setting.Since I’ve started writing those big S’s into my journal wheneversynchronicities happen, they seem to be happening more often. Because I’mobserving them, I’m attuned to them. As we do when practicing any new skill, I’mbuilding the neural pathways that carry that type of information. I’m using theobserver effect consciously, collapsing the possibility wave into theprobabilities that I desire.That doesn’t mean that I can magically create anything I want like a magicianpulling a rabbit out of a hat. It’s a process of nudging reality consistentlyrather than manifesting something out of nothing immediately. It’s using theprinciples of nature rather than defying them.For instance, I’ve wanted to learn some French to use during my frequent tripsto that country. Collapsing the possibility wave doesn’t mean that I caninstantly speak French. I still need to buy the online course, practice mypronunciation, and learn the vocabulary.Ordinary things then happen that support my intent. A friend mentions a bookthat’s available. It contains stickers with French words that you place on thoseitems in your house. Seeing the objects and French words together every daybuilds your vocabulary quickly.image [images/p287.jpg]French language stickies adorn common objects in my house.Next, I start to notice correspondences between Spanish words I already know andFrench words I don’t know. I meet a Frenchman at a farmer’s market and exchangea few words of French. Another friend tells me you can turn on French subtitleswhen you watch movies or watch them dubbed in French with English subtitles. Mywife and I occasionally have dinner with our tablets next to us, with atranslation window open, and practice having a simple French conversation. Andon and on. Once I decide to learn French, the whole universe appears to conspireto support my goal.THOUGHT BY THOUGHT AND NEURON BY NEURONYou cultivate synchronicity with consistently held thought. Perhaps you’remaking supper, and you discover that you’re missing white pepper, which isessential to the recipe. The nearest convenience store is two miles away. Youget in your car, leave your driveway, make the turns required, park, go in thestore, and find the aisle in which white pepper is kept. You don’t just go fromstanding in your kitchen, needing white pepper, to standing in the spice aisle.There are many steps along the way. That’s the way consistently held thoughtsproduce things.Researchers at New York University found that romance-minded students whobelieved they would get a date were significantly more likely to do so. Golferswho were told that they were playing with a lucky ball scored better duringputting practice. In games of chance, optimists win more prizes than pessimists.People who see a silver lining around dark clouds, using their minds topositively reframe negative events, deactivate the amygdala, the midbrainstructure that processes fear. According to psychologist Richard Wiseman, thesepeople “expect the best outcomes, and these expectations become self-fulfillingprophecies” (Rockwood, 2017). Best-selling author Tim Ferriss says, “The mostfulfilled and effective people I know—world-famous creatives, billionaires,thought leaders, and more—look at their life’s journey as perhaps 25 percentfinding themselves and 75 percent creating themselves” (Ferriss, 2017).Over the course of 15 years, a team led by Dr. Robert Gramling of the Universityof Rochester surveyed 2,816 adults between the ages of 35 and 75. His study wasaimed at identifying those at risk for heart disease. The results showed thatbeliefs made a huge difference in their health.Those who believed they were at low risk of heart disease had only a third theincidence of strokes and heart attacks. The effect held even after controllingfor variables such as cholesterol level, smoking, high blood pressure, familyhistory, and other risk factors (Gramling et al., 2008). The belief in—and fearof—heart problems was associated with contracting cardiovascular disease.That’s the way mind becomes matter. Thought by thought, we’re engaging neuralpathways. When you have a belief about your heart, and you practice that beliefin your mind year after year, you’re building new neurons, neuron by neuron.It’s not that you have a single negative thought about heart disease and dropdead instantly. It’s not that you have a single positive thought and findyourself healed forever—just the way you don’t desire white pepper and findyourself instantly in the grocery store. There are steps in between, as beliefsare rehearsed and thoughts become things and neurons shape biology. Hold athought consistently, and you create the biological and environmental conditionsthat draw that thing to you.THOUGHT FIELDS AND THE COLLECTIVE UNCONSCIOUSIn my live workshops, I’ve noticed that generally people seem to be effortlessmasters of one aspect of life. We work with five life areas: * Work (including career and retirement) * Love (including all close relationships) * Money * Health (including weight, diet, and exercise) * SpiritualityTypically, people have no problem at all with at least one of these areas. Some,for instance, are career masters, enjoying fast-track success from their teenageyears. Others effortlessly maintain a deep and abiding spiritual practice, woveninto the fabric of their lives. Some, like my wife, automatically create greatmarriages and wonderful relationships with family and children.One of my friends, Phil Town, is a money master. He’s one of the most successfulhedge fund managers in the business. He’s written two best-selling books ontaking charge of your own money. Money is his medium, and he talks, thinks, andacts effortlessly in this sphere of influence.Another of my friends, Andrew Vidich, is a spiritual master. He has meditatedevery day of his life since his teen years. He spends over an hour in meditationevery morning, and kindness and joy sparkle out of his eyes and his being. He isin the energy field of spirituality, and people feel transformed in his presencewithout a word being spoken. When you read his books, Light upon Light and LoveIs a Secret, you share the energy field he inhabits, and you feel uplifted.While we may be effortless masters of one of the five life areas, we maystruggle with another. A friend of mine who started a hugely successful personalgrowth company in the late 1980s became a multimillionaire in his 20s. He’shealthy and has enjoyed all the trappings of success. Yet after two glasses ofwine at a mastermind group meeting, he confided in me how desperately unhappy hewas in his love life. “I just got divorced from my third wife,” he saiddisconsolately. “I had to sell my executive jet to get the money to pay her off.I understand why she divorced me . . . I’m a jerk, and I’ve screwed up everyrelationship in my life.” Being a master in one life area is no guarantee ofsuccess in another.One of the pioneers in the use of acupressure for healing was a clinicalpsychologist named Roger Callahan. He developed a method called thought fieldtherapy. The term thought field is striking. Callahan believed that we havehabitual patterns of consciousness, which he called thought fields. When weparticipate in a thought field, we inhabit the energy of that field, and weperceive the material world through the lens of that field.Thought fields can also be large scale, akin to Jung’s collective unconscious.Jung believed that most of our behavior is driven by the unconscious. The partof the mind we’re aware of is like the tip of an iceberg protruding from the topof the sea. We think that’s all there is. In reality, our behavior is beingshaped by the collective thought fields below the surface, even though we’re notconscious of them.image [images/p290.jpg]The collective unconscious is like an iceberg. We’re only aware of the tip, ourconscious thought processes above the surface. Below is the collectiveunconscious, driving behavior.Types of energy in the collective unconscious can form thought fields. These canbe simple and innocuous, like the thought field associated with the hobby ofquilting. I once attended a workshop at a big conference center that was hostingseveral other groups. One of these was a quilting convention.I didn’t know a thing about quilts when I walked in the door. So I sat at atable with the quilters for some of the meals. Sucked into their thought field,resonating with their enthusiasm, quilting seemed like the most fascinatingactivity in the world.Those who have mastery in one of the five life areas inhabit that particularthought field. Get two investors together and they begin sharing their investinginsights as they resonate together. Put two meditators together and theyreinforce the thought field of meditation as they interact.Other thought fields are not so benevolent. Spend time with drug addicts oralcoholics and you can sense the thought fields holding their habits in place.People with similar patterns resonate together. That’s why it is impossible foraddicts to get and stay clean if they keep the company of other addicts. Theyare used to resonating with that thought field, and it sucks them in when theyare close.When you are in a fearful state of mind, fear breeds fear. The thought field offear seeks out external stimuli to be afraid of. The fearful mind precipitatesfearful probabilities out of the infinite potentials in the possibility wave.You might believe that the problems are “out there” in your environment, causedby other people, corporations, the government, or random events. In reality, youare inhabiting a thought field that shapes the material space around you. Mindcan produce matter in negative as well as positive ways. In the Bible, theancient philosopher Job laments: “What I feared has come upon me.”EMBODYING THE FIELDS OF MASTERYWhen you’re in a meditation workshop with Andrew Vidich, meditation seems easy.In his thought field, sharing in his unwavering attunement with the field ofspiritual experience, similar frequencies are activated in you. Thosefrequencies resonate with similar frequencies in Andrew’s local field and,through him, the same frequencies in the nonlocal field. While connected inpowerful resonance patterns with the field produced by meditation, youparticipate in that energy.I’ve had a similar experience in money workshops with Phil Town. While you’re inthe field of money expertise Phil generates, his explanations seem clear andsimple. You have breakthroughs in your understanding of stocks and financialreports as you align your consciousness with Phil’s field. In a room with 200people all entrained to the same money frequency, you condition your mind andbrain in resonance.image [images/p292.jpg]It’s easy to meditate when resonating with the local field of a meditationgroup.After you leave the meditation workshop or money seminar, the concepts soonbecome fuzzy. You start to forget what you learned and the state you attained,unless you practice. When you rehearse attunement with that thought field byreading books, watching videos, and learning more, you maintain your resonancewith the field. Soon you’ve built the neural pathways and brain states that arecharacteristic of that thought field. You’ve moved from touching the field toembodying the field. You’re on your way to mastery.When we use our minds in this way, we condition matter. When we make a consciouschoice to attain mastery in a field, we activate resonance with all thecomponents of that field. Some may be local to us right where we are. Others maybe nonlocal, distant in time or space. Our intent, filling our consciousness,opens the doors to synchronicity. Opportunities and connections appear seeminglyout of the blue. Yet they are generated by our participation in that particularthought field.As an author and trainer, I’m fortunate to spend personal time with manytransformational leaders. Individually, they generate inspiring energy fields.When they’re together, the effect is enhanced. Being with them conditions mythinking and my energy as we come into resonance. Surrounding yourself withuplifting people is one of the best things you can do for both mental andphysical health.The following story, told by one of those leaders, is a remarkable story ofmanifestation. Who hasn’t dreamed of manifesting a million dollars? This type ofaspiration might seem beyond the pale of possibility. Yet as the Germanphilosopher Goethe exclaimed (1887):What you can do, or dream you can, begin it,Boldness has genius, power, and magic in it.MANIFESTING A MILLION DOLLARSBy Raymond AaronI lead transformational retreats, and in one exercise at the start of eachevent, we ask people to define what they’d most like to manifest during thecourse of the workshop.As we went around the group, people chose the usual goals, like sleeping throughthe night, a revelation about which career path to choose, or having noconflicts with their spouse during the event.But one man said he wanted a million dollars. He had started a company with anew technology to harvest stem cells, at the leading edge of health research.His goal was to have the financial freedom to pursue his dreams.I didn’t comment out loud, but I thought, Wow, that’s a huge goal.When the turn came for the next participant, he decided to copy the man who’djust spoken. He said he wanted a million dollars too!I groaned inside. Two men who both want a million dollars to manifest during theretreat! It seemed impossible.Three days later, the two men were bursting with excitement, and shared theirnews with the group. The second man’s father was an investment banker. He’d toldhis father about the stem cell company, set up a meeting with the first man, andhis father had become incredibly excited by the potential of the startupcompany. He’d told the first man that he’d be able to raise $100 million forhim. Not $1 million, $100 million!“And I get a one percent finder’s fee!” said the second man. “That’s a milliondollars!”ATTUNING YOUR MIND TO THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STATESynchronicity is much more than meets the eye. It seems like a series of eventsthat mysteriously line up to produce a significant result.In reality, synchronicity represents the coordination of all life, from the mostdistant nonlocal reaches of space to the most intimate local environment of ourthoughts. All are synchronized by resonant fields, and as we make choices withour minds, we set up resonance patterns that extend to infinity.Our thoughts are profoundly creative. Once we realize this, we direct ourthoughts consciously. We do what it takes to attune the functioning of our mindswith the most elevated possibilities. We use our creative power deliberately.Goethe said, “We all have certain electric and magnetic powers within us andourselves exercise an attractive and repelling force” (as cited in Jung, 1952).Understanding the creative power of our thoughts empowers us to use them wiselyand deliberately, attuning to the thought fields of love, kindness, andcreativity.When I wake up in the morning, my first priority is attunement. My mind isswirling and my attention scattered, often focusing on the problems and negativeaspects of the day ahead. Fragments of bad dreams and disturbing images I’veseen on TV pop in and out at random.If I were to start my day that way, I would bring that swirling, negative,scattered thought field to my material reality. I would condition my materialworld with the energy of that dysfunctional field.So the first thing I do is attune my thoughts to the highest possible state. Itap away my worry and stress, and sit calmly in meditation. I know what my bodyfeels like when I’m in that state of attunement to the infinite, with my brainproducing high amplitudes of alpha, theta, and delta waves, and get in touchwith that frequency. Once I’m attuned, I bask in that state for a long time. Mythoughts escape from the swirl of confusion in which I woke up.I feel happiness and optimism surging up within me like the exuberance ofspring. I celebrate that wonderful feeling and tap again to anchor it in mindand body. If there’s a patch of grass nearby, I walk outside, stand barefoot inthe dew, and ground myself in Earth’s frequencies. I might listen to aninspirational audio to give my thoughts direction. If I’m home, I look at myvision board and affirm my goals. I write in my journal, recording positiveintentions for the life journey ahead. I fill my mind with gratitude for theblessings of my life. I savor the anticipation of the synchronicities that willappear to delight me in the hours ahead.Then, centered and inspired, I walk into my day.image [images/p295.jpg]Making attunement the first priority each day conditions your local field.Do this for just one month, every day, and your life will start to change. Useyour mind deliberately, and matter will change. You will call synchronicity toyou. Whether your challenges are with money, health, love, work, orspirituality, you’ll find that you quickly move to a new level of mastery whenyou begin using your mind for conscious creation. Attune to those energy fields,and matter follows right along. Synchronicities line up all around you, and youlive a life attuned to the music of the spheres.Sometimes, right in the middle of an ordinary day, the beauty of life hits melike a cloudburst. I stop in my tracks, overwhelmed, tearful, too stunned to beable to take it all in. I stop what I’m doing and allow the feeling to expand. Iopen my heart big enough to stretch around the full extent of my blessings.I relish those moments, savoring them as I expand my sense of self toaccommodate the full measure of life’s beauty and perfection. A life lived inconscious synchrony with the universe is a life well lived.PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEActivities to practice this week: * As you practice EcoMeditation morning and evening, hold the intention that you align your life with synchronicity. * Notice emergence when it appears in your personal world. You might observe this in: Colonies of insects Flocks of birds Schools of fish The flow of traffic in cities * In your journal, write down three or more big synchronous events that have happened in your life. * Also in your journal, make a brief note of any experiences of emergence you’ve witnessed in the past few days.The Extended Play version of this chapter includes: * Video and full report of Mathias Rust’s flight * How emergence permeates our daily life * Metronome entrainment videos * “Hawaii Aloha” sung by IZ, on YouTube * The extraordinary healing story of concentration camp survivor Jack Schwarz * Ten famous people who eluded death on 9/11To access the Extended Play version, visit: MindToMatter.club/Chapter6[https://mindtomatter.club/Chapter6/]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7 [content-toc.xhtml#t9]THINKING FROM BEYOND LOCAL MIND [content-toc.xhtml#t9]Muir Woods National Monument is one of the loveliest places in California. It isnamed after conservationist John Muir. When he was 11 years old, his familyemigrated from Scotland to the United States. He became an avid outdoorsman,with a wanderlust that took him all over the continent. Just before his 30thbirthday, he walked from Indianapolis to the Gulf of Mexico, a distance of athousand miles.Muir eventually settled in California, writing an influential series of articlescalled Studies in the Sierra. He published 10 books expounding his philosophy ofnaturalism. His 1901 book Our National Parks brought him to the attention ofpresident Theodore Roosevelt, who made a trip to Yosemite Valley to visit Muirin 1903. Muir’s life became a tribute to connection with nature.The forest in the park itself is primeval. Coast redwoods are the tallest livingbeings on the planet, reaching heights of over 100 yards or meters. The oldesttrees alive were saplings when Jesus walked the earth 2,000 years ago, whilesome alive today were 1,000 years old when Columbus sailed the Atlantic.Fossilized examples show that the species has been around for over 200 millionyears.image [images/p298.jpg]The giant redwoods carry a powerful presence.The land on which Muir Woods is located was purchased in 1905 byconservationists William and Elizabeth Kent. Believing the place was sacred,they wanted to protect the giant redwoods from loggers. The Kents were forced totake out a bank loan to acquire the property. Elizabeth was nervous about theirfinancial exposure, but William responded, “If we lost all the money we have andsaved these trees, it would be worthwhile, wouldn’t it?” In 1908, PresidentTheodore Roosevelt proclaimed the land the Muir Woods National Monument.In the historic spring following World War II, delegates from all the primarynations of the world met in San Francisco to draft the charter of the UnitedNations. Just before he was due to open the conference, President Franklin D.Roosevelt died. On May 19, 1945, to honor him, the delegates held a ceremony inMuir Woods’ Cathedral Grove. Today, around a million people a year visit MuirWoods to gape in wonder at trees that have been around longer than recordedhuman history.WHEN THE UNIVERSE SIGNALS A U-TURNOne afternoon on the way to visit a friend, Christine and I drove past MuirWoods—accidentally. We’d missed a turn at an intersection a mile away.It was the Memorial Day holiday weekend, the official start of summer in theUnited States. There were thousands of people at the park. Traffic was backed upbefore and after the entrance. All the parking lots were full to overflowing,and visitors were parked along the side of the road more than a mile away.Pedestrians were walking along both sides of the narrow road in a steady streamof coming and going.We talked about how much we would like to visit Muir Woods but that we’d waitfor a time when it wasn’t so crowded.We enjoyed our evening with our friends and decided to spend the night in theirspare room. We left the following morning, heading for home. Suddenly, Christineexclaimed, “We’re so close to Muir Woods, why don’t we go there now?” We made aquick U-turn and drove back to the park.It was 7:45 A.M., and the parking lot was almost empty. We walked down the pathtoward Cathedral Grove, the heart of the forest. We drank in the beauty of thetrees, the air, and the sounds of birds, squirrels, and the stream. Christinesaid, “Let’s treat this as a walking meditation.” We walked in silence.We walked for more than a mile, all around the most popular loop in CathedralGrove. It took an hour. Frequently, we stopped in awe to gaze up at the grandeurof the trees.image [images/p300.jpg]The redwood trunks draw the eye upward.We didn’t see a single person anywhere along the way. On the return journey, weheaded for the park entrance, our souls deeply nourished, feeling profoundlyconnected with nature, one with the great universal field.When we got back to our starting point in the parking lot, the morning’svisitors were streaming into the park. Four tour buses had arrived, disgorginghundreds of people. The crush of humanity at the entrance was so thick that wehad to elbow our way out.Yet we’d been able to enjoy the forest, all to ourselves, basking in the sacredspace of nature, between the two invasions. Just following our bliss, with nofixed plan, going with the flow, we had our wish to enjoy Muir Woods without thecrowds—on the most crowded weekend of the year.BEING IN THE FLOW OF NONLOCAL MINDAlignment with the universal flow unlocks alignment with all the synchrony,grace, beauty, and wisdom of the universe. As you, an individual human being, alocal mind, move into alignment with the great nonlocal mind—the mind behind allmind, the mind that gives rise to all consciousness—as you merge and become onewith that mind, your mind, your individual local mind, is no longer functioningas an isolated, separate, lonely fragment, cut off from the whole by theillusion of separateness.Instead, the flow of nonlocal mind is now in you, and you are in the flow. Youare now no longer local consciousness. You are now universal consciousness. Youhave stepped from the position of that which is acted on to the perspective ofthat which acts.Horizons of creativity open up to you. Vistas of possibility flood yourawareness. You know yourself to be one with universal wisdom, with universalpower, with universal intelligence, with universal love. From that place inconsciousness, you live a life of wisdom, intelligence, and love. You no longerask for love, need love, or crave love, because you are love. You no longer prayfor wisdom, because you are wisdom. You no longer seek inner peace, because yourvery nature is peace. Standing in that place, you have access to all the wisdom,peace, and love in the universe.This is the transcendent state that has been experienced and described bymystics throughout the ages. It is the state of flow that elite athletesexperience at times of peak performance. It is the state into which artistsenter when they create their most inspired work. It is the state childrennaturally inhabit when they lose themselves in play.It is the state we’re meant to live our lives in all the time. It’s beenperceived as a special, occasional exception to the grind of daily life. Yetit’s actually meant to be the way we start and end each day. Each day is meantto flow in an unfolding of synchronous possibilities.When I meet people in my workshops and they tell the stories of their lives, I’mmoved by their suffering. Yet I’m also struck by the way this sufferingaccumulates as they move through life. They weren’t born suffering. As toddlers,they knew how to laugh, love, and play. They then have negative experiences andgradually move from the spontaneously joyful childhood state to the worried,diminished, stressed adult state.PUTTING FLOW INTO PRACTICEHow can we reverse the process? That may be the most important question of ourlives. We can learn to be proactive, doing those things in consciousness and inpractice that bring us back into synchrony with the universe. We can learn torelease our suffering and learn to play again. We can rehearse the states ofconsciousness that we knew as children and turn our adult lives into a joyfulplayground of possibility.The way to put this into practice is simple.When you wake up every morning, simply align your consciousness with the highestpossible frequency of which you are capable. Sit quietly, read the words thatinspire you the most, and enter a contemplative state. Before you begin yourday, before you begin to think or create, align yourself. Align yourself to thehighest possible vibrational frequency that you know. Align yourself with themost elevated energy field of which you are conscious.image [images/p302.jpg]The first conscious act of the day is to align with the nonlocal universalfield.Use this gift called consciousness to constantly align yourself to that highestpossible energy field at the start of every day. As you do this, you will feel ashift in your body. You will feel a physical sense of shifting to a new plane,of moving into an altered state.The physical sensation of being aligned with the universal field, one withnonlocal mind, is quite different from the physical experience generated by theillusion of being a separate local mind cut off from the love, the wisdom, thebrilliance, the elevated perspective of the great nonlocal intelligence.Then, in this space you create for yourself every morning, at one with theuniverse, the thoughts you think will be different. The actions you take will bedifferent. The aspirations you have will be completely different. Theexpectations you hold will change. The assumptions you make will be nothing likethe assumptions made in a state of isolated local mind. The worldview from whichyou see life and creation will be expansive. The possibility fields you perceivewill be infinite. Your very sense of self, who you are as a human being, willshift completely.LIVING IN ATTUNEMENT WITH THE UNIVERSAL FIELDA you living in attunement with the universal field has an entirely differentsense of self than a you living as a self isolated in local mind. Perceivingyourself as one with this synchronized universe, you move into your day with asense of equanimity, power, peace, joy, love, and exuberance. You align withcreative genius, and you shape the world outside of yourself based on a sense ofhigh vision drawn from the reality field of that universal mind.Suddenly, you are no longer an isolated individual bumping into this or thatproblem or challenge. Instead, you are part of an orchestra of synchronizedmovement. One with the universe, you are one with everyone else who is one withthe universe. One with the universe, you are one with every force and phenomenonin nature that is also one with the universe. One with the universe, you danceto the tune of the natural harmonics of creation.image [images/p304.jpg]When we’re in resonance with the universal field, we’re in synchrony witheveryone else who is resonating with the field.THE RESONANT SYMPHONY OF ALL MINDWhen you align with the universe, your individual mind is automaticallysynchronized with every other mind that is also synchronized with the universe,and the only minds with whom you are out of tune are those who are themselvesout of tune with the universe.You love them, you bless them, and by your attunement, you invite them toattunement as well. You cannot help those you love by moving out of attunementand into the place of non-attunement in which they live. You can only help themby being vibrantly attuned to universal self. You are then a beacon ofinvitation, welcoming them to the possibility of joining you in the dance ofattunement.If they do join you, they are naturally and effortlessly attuned with you, andif they choose otherwise, you bless them on their path. You need not persuadethem or induce them. They will join the dance whenever they are ready. Let themgo; you will find that there are thousands of people, millions of people,billions of people, ready to dance with you in attunement with life.This is the universe’s wish for you: That you find and remain in thisattunement. That you start your day calibrating yourself to the universal field.That you start each day by dropping the illusion that you are a struggling localentity and by accepting the reality that you are one with all that is. That iswhat the universe most wants for you.RELINQUISHING THE ILLUSION OF LOCALITYThe universe knows that once you let go of the illusion that you are anisolated, local entity and embrace the reality that you are one with universalmind, suddenly you are part of the flow. Synchronously, you dance with everybeing who is part of the universal dance. Your life flows easily andorganically. All of the friction, all of the static that you experience at thelevel of local mind falls away. Your life is easy, happy, and naturallycreative. You feel one with this universal reality of oneness. The kind of lifeyou create for yourself from that perspective is radically different from thelife you create from the perspective of an isolated local self.image [images/p305.jpg]We move through our lives in conscious alignment with the universal field.Making this choice day after day, this choice to align every morning, sends yourlife off on a completely new trajectory, one rich in possibilities. One suffusedwith joy. One bursting with vitality and enthusiasm.You are at a crossroads in this moment. A choice point. The point at which youeither embrace the reality of yourself as one with a benevolent universe orcontinue in the illusion that you are not. You face this choice this moment. Youface this choice every moment.THE MOST IMPORTANT CHOICE YOU’LL EVER MAKEThis is the most important choice you will make in your entire life: aligned ornot aligned. And as you make that choice now, as you align in the next moment,and the next and the next, and the next day, the next week, the next month, asyou make that choice an infinite number of times, it becomes not a choice but afact. It becomes not a decision but a way of life. As it becomes a way of life,as it becomes the default setting for your consciousness, you begin to build theneural wiring that anchors it in matter. The matter of your body becomes thevehicle not for your local mind but for nonlocal mind.Nonlocal mind, driving the neural circuits of your brain and body, creates a newbrain and body. It builds cells. Regenerates DNA. Creates a field of connection.Generates coherence in your thoughts, words, and deeds. Opens possibilities inyour sphere of influence. Co-creates with you at the level of your materialreality.The material reality you create when one with the universal mind is completelydifferent from the material reality you create when cut off from universal mind.You think these thoughts in alignment with universal mind and they become thingsin alignment with universal mind. The matter of your body is shifted andchanged. The matter of your material reality is shifted and changed. And aftermoment after moment after moment of alignment, you live in an entirely differentmaterial reality from the one you would have created had you remained locked inthe prison of local mind and local self.What will we create together in this unified field? Let’s find out!PUTTING THESE IDEAS INTO PRACTICEActivities to practice this week: * Take a walk in nature and practice walking slowly. Feel each footfall. * Walk or stand barefoot on sand or wet grass for a few minutes each day. * During your EcoMeditation practice morning and evening, consciously tune your local self to nonlocal mind. * One day, after meditating, in your journal, draw an illustration of your local self and nonlocal reality. You don’t have to be a great artist—just a simple line drawing is fine. * Ask nonlocal mind, What is your highest vision for me? and write whatever pops into your head down in your journal.The Extended Play version of this chapter includes: * Video of fields of the human heart * Instruction for how to ground and center yourself in Earth’s fields * Researcher Stephan Schwartz on anomalous experiences and quantum consciousnessTo access the Extended Play version, visit: MindToMatter.club/Chapter7[https://mindtomatter.club/Chapter2/]"},{"pageContent":"AFTERWORD [content-toc.xhtml#t10]Where Mind Takes Us Next [content-toc.xhtml#t10]I’m privileged to live among awesome creators.

The visions we see in our mind’s eye translate themselves,thought by thought, into the concrete reality of material form all around us. Aswe choose our thoughts, we are in fact choosing our material reality, whether weare consciously aware of it or not.What sort of world will we create in the coming moments, days, months, years,and decades?I’m convinced it will be a world of peace, of compassion, of beauty, ofopportunity, of wisdom. In the past centuries, we’ve practiced creatingsurvival, fear, anger, war, resentment, competition, shame, guilt, rivalry, andother forms of strife. As a species, we’ve had thousands of generations toexperience the material circumstances that result from that type of thinking.We have seen the suffering it produces. Now, I believe, we are ready for a newexperience. We are ready to paint a new world. As we realize our ability tochoose that world, we begin to select thoughts, feelings, experiences, andbeliefs that facilitate its creation.When we first make the discovery that we create with our minds, we produce ourfirst small deliberate creations. Like a baby taking its first steps, we’retentative and uncertain.But if you’ve ever watched a child learn to walk, you know that this hesitancyquickly gives way to exuberant confidence. Now free to explore the world, thechild strides about enthusiastically. She goes places she has never been able togo before. Her circle of influence expands ever wider, as she ventures fartherand farther from her point of origin. She quickly adjusts her mind to the newreality and assumes a degree of mobility and freedom she never knew before shetook the first step.That’s us today. As a species, we have just begun to scratch the surface of ourpower. We have no idea yet what we are capable of. We’ve hardly taken even ourvery first step. We are only just beginning to realize what we might accomplish.While the future is unknown, shrouded in mystery, we can look back and seeclearly what has happened in the past. We see the two world wars of the 20thcentury, and the even bloodier conflicts of the 19th century and earlier times.We see the ignorance, poverty, starvation, injustice, and cruelty in which ourspecies has been bred for millennia. While a millennium of progress in scienceand philosophy has given us the first glimmers of enlightenment, human existencehas been driven by the stark requirements of survival for most of our history.As a species, we’ve been there, done that, and bought the T-shirt. Now it’s timefor more. When we didn’t know that our thoughts created our reality, we assumedthat all the suffering in which we lived was a fixed and objective reality.Now we know better. We have begun to understand the immense potential of ourminds to create reality. We understand the leverage we possess over both themicroscopic and the macroscopic levels of form. On the microscopic scale, weunderstand that our thoughts are shaping the anatomy and physiology of our cellsat every moment, calling molecules into and out of existence, like a medievalalchemist’s fantasy.On the macroscopic level, our thoughts combine with those of the rest of ourspecies to create the broad sweep of history. The history we create once weunderstand our power is very different from the history we created when welabored blindly under the illusion that reality was composed of random eventsthat simply happened to us.As conscious creators, we choose differently. When our survival needs push us tothink angry and bitter thoughts, born out of the illusion of scarcity andcompetition, we choose not to think them. Not thinking them, we join with themillions of other people making similar choices. We find ourselves drawn intothe reality fields of that new community. Multiplying the resonance of thoseshared fields, we shift the direction of society.When you choose not to think that negative thought, and you replace it with apositive one instead, you aren’t just shifting your own reality. You’re shiftingreality for the whole human species. You’re adding to the sum of kindness andcompassion in the world. You’re reinforcing that new reality field. You’re oneof millions of people adding their positive energy to the new reality. You’rehelping transform it into an irresistible force that turns the tide of history.While the forces of misery—people driven by survival and ignorant of the factthat they were creating the same dark world that they feared—may have beenrunning the show for millennia, today is different. We understand our power. Wemake different choices. We use our power to shape first our own personal realityand then, collectively, the reality of the planet.Having experimented with fearful thinking and its consequences, I believe thatwe have now embarked on a new experiment. Like that toddler taking her firststeps, we are shining light into the darkness of our old conditioned thinking.That first beam of light, like that first step, gleams hesitantly. Yet the lightfeels good. The molecules we create in our bodies when we lighten our thinkingfeel good. The circumstances we create in the world around us when we enlightenour minds are infinitely more enjoyable. In a positive feedback loop, thisreinforces our desire for more of the same.Growing increasingly confident in our newfound power to create a positive world,we begin to think boldly. We imagine what a world without war, hunger, orpoverty might look like. That subjective immaterial vision is the embryo ofobjective material reality.This is the work we now do together. Joining with the millions of other peopleall over the world who have made the commitment to a positive future forthemselves and humankind, we produce an irresistible field of love. The field oflove we create opposes no one. We don’t judge, condemn, or complain. We simplylove.As the field of love grows stronger, it bathes everything within itscircumference. Out of this shared reality field of love, a new material realityis born. The material reality reflects the energy of the vibrational reality. Inthe new material reality, people act instinctively with kindness and compassion.Respect and altruism are the new normal in human relationships.From the moment they are conceived, the children of the future grow up withthese assumptions. Bathed in love from conception onward, children experiencenothing else. They become vibrant creators, with their play, socialinteractions, and life expectations saturated with the certainty of love.Growing up in a world of love, they create love in their careers and families.The world changes to reflect their expectations.I have no idea what our children, or our children’s children, might create. I amcertain that the types of creations produced by human beings saturated with lovewill be the products of happiness. I believe that their fresh creations willtake science, technology, education, art, music, philosophy, religion,architecture, the environment, civilization, and society to places far beyondwhat our generation can conceive of.That’s the world I plan to live in for the rest of my life. That’s the world Ichoose to create with my personal thoughts from the moment I open my eyes at thestart of each new day. That’s the world I invite you to join me in creating withyour personal thoughts moment by moment. There is no better place to live.Thank you for partnering with me in this journey of exploration. We have seenhow the proposition that mind creates matter is not mere metaphysicalspeculation, but scientific fact. We have discovered that our minds createreality and become aware of the potential each of us has to create a benevolentreality using the astonishing power of thought. As we play together from thispoint on, I look forward to co-creating this delicious world of love and joywith you."},{"pageContent":"REFERENCES [content-toc.xhtml#t11]CHAPTER 1Baker, S. J. (1925).

No scientistcreates alone. We build on the discoveries of others. I am so grateful to thehundreds of visionary researchers whose work is cited in these pages, and uponwhose foundations I have built. Wherever I looked for evidence, I usually foundit, and the breadth of mind and imagination I discovered in the work of mycolleagues often humbled and astounded me.Everyone in the healing field, especially me, owes a debt of gratitude toclinical psychologist David Feinstein. His intellectual rigor, brilliantacademic writing skills, and ethical awareness have shaped the work of an entiregeneration of energy healing professionals. He provided detailed feedback on thefirst few chapters and helped shape this book.Many other professionals read sections dealing with their areas of expertise andcorrected errors and misunderstandings. EEG expert Gary Groesbeck gave medetailed feedback on the brain wave chapters, while his colleague JudithPennington provided clear explanations of the Awakened Mind and Evolved Mindpatterns. Psychiatrist Ron Ruden alerted me to the importance of delta brainwaves and the many ways we can increase them.Rollin McCraty of the Institute of HeartMath gave me clear and explicitexplanations of Schumann resonances and field line resonances, as well asconducting primary research on the topic. Dean Radin of the Institute for NoeticSciences helped me understand the statistical basis of the research onpremonition and maintains the most current website listing scientificpublications of extraordinary human experiences. His remarkable experiments haveprovided a sound scientific basis for this work.My close friend Bob Hoss is a brilliant polymath whose mind knows no boundaries.He’s an expert on the neuroscience of dreaming and how the brain uses symbolismto solve problems. He provided the pillars for the passages on Carl Jung, thecollective unconscious, the emotional brain, and quantum phenomena.I’m grateful to Lissa Rankin for fascinating conversations that led to clearerinsights into how mind becomes matter. Also to Bill Bengston for his provocativework on using energy to heal cancer and for helping me understand both theanimal and human dimensions of this research.I’m grateful to all the institutes and conferences that sponsor my liveworkshops, like Esalen, Kripalu, Omega, and the New York Open Center. At thesemodern gathering places of mind and spirit, I meet a variety of fascinatingteachers whose insights enrich my understanding.I’m privileged to interact with many other like-minded people who are members ofthe Transformational Leadership Council. Thank you, Jack Canfield, for foundingand fostering this remarkable group of visionaries. Many of those who endorsedthis book are fellow members.I’m also grateful to the skeptics. There are many professional naysayers whoclaim that humans are beings of matter rather than energy. Their attacks on thefield of energy healing, especially in the entries in Wikipedia that theycontrol, and their denial of the science described in this book serve a usefulpurpose. Many of these experiments have been designed to rebut their arguments.The relentless barrage of skeptical criticism is indirectly responsible for thethousands of studies of energy healing published in peer-reviewed journals.I’m especially grateful to my friend and Hay House president Reid Tracy. Thisbook was born in a conversation with him, and he suggested the title. His entireteam at Hay House, including publisher Patty Gift, editor Anne Barthel, andmarketing director Richelle Fredson, has been a joy to work with, on both apersonal and a professional level.I’ve had an amazing professional relationship with my friend and editorStephanie Marohn for over a decade, and I’m so thankful for her keen eye andwarm encouragement. Karin Kinsey’s expert eye is responsible for theillustrations and typesetting, and she’s given me enthusiastic support allalong. I’m also grateful for the inspired editorial guidance of Hay House editorAnne Barthel and the eagle eye of copyeditor Rachel Shields.I cannot even begin to express how much the genius of Heather Montgomery,General Manager of my organization Energy Psychology Group, makes in my life.Heather manages a complex organization with wisdom and humor. Her hand-pickedteam, including Seth Buffum, Marion Allen, Kendra Heath, Jackie Viramontez, andMack Diesel, maintain high professional standards and make work fun even underpressure. There are many more laughs in the office than tears!I’m also grateful for the board members and volunteers of the National Institutefor Integrative Healthcare, the nonprofit I founded. We’ve now conducted orhelped catalyze over 100 scientific studies and treated more than 20,000veterans with PTSD. Giving back is a cornerstone of my life and I’m inspired bythe hundreds of NIIH volunteers who do the same.Many of my fellow transformational entrepreneurs supported the launch of thisbook, and I’m grateful to Nick Ortner, Mastin Kipp, Lissa Rankin, Joe Dispenza,Natalie Ledwell, Joe Mercola, Dave Asprey, and many others who shared it withtheir communities.During the wildfire that consumed my home and office in October 2017, acommitted group of people came together to help us recover. I traveled for mostof the month while my wife, Christine, navigated our family’s next steps athome. Her daughters, Julia and Jessie, as well as my children, Rexana andLionel, together with Julia’s husband, Tyler, formed an impromptu committee totake care of hundreds of details, from finding us emergency shelter to makinglists of destroyed items. This huge disruption could have derailed the book, butthanks to their efforts it did not.I’m blessed with a large extended family. Tens of thousands of people visit myEFT Universe website each month, and thousands train with us every year. Thedepth of emotional intimacy and heart sharing we experience both in person andin our social networking sites makes it impossible to ever feel alone.
