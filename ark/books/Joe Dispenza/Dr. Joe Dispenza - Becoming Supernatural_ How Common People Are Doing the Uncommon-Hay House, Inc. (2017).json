From the multi-century lifespan of Li Ching-Yuen, the martial artistwhose 256-year-long life began in 1677 and included 14 wives and over 200children before he died in 1933, to the spontaneous healing of myriad diseasesdocumented by the Institute of Noetic Sciences (IONS) through 3,500 referencesfrom over 800 journals in 20 languages, the evidence clearly tells us that we’renot what we’ve been told in the past, and even more than we’ve allowed ourselvesto imagine.As the acceptance of expanded human potential gains mainstream momentum, thequestion has shifted from “What is possible in our lives?” to “How do we do it?How do we awaken our extraordinary potential in everyday life?” The answer tothis question forms the foundation for this book: Becoming Supernatural: HowCommon People Are Doing the Uncommon.Dr. Joe Dispenza is a doctor, a scientist, and a modern-day mystic. He’s also asynthesizer of information with a vision that extends beyond the confines of asingle scientific discipline. Drawing from diverse fields of rock-solid science,such as epigenetics, molecular biology, neurocardiology, and quantum physics,Joe crosses the traditional boundaries that have separated scientific thinkingand human experience in the past. In doing so he opens the door to a bold newparadigm of self-actualized empowerment—a way of thinking and living based uponwhat we sense is possible in our lives, as well as what we accept as scientificfact. This new frontier of realized potential is redefining what it means to bea fully enabled, fully capacitated human. And it’s a frontier that holds promisefor everyone from homemakers, students, and skilled laborers to scientists,engineers, and health-care professionals.The reason for such a wide appeal is that Joe’s work today parallels a provenmodel that masters have used successfully with their students for centuries. Theidea for the model is simple—once we have a direct experience of a greaterpotential, it frees us to embrace that potential in our everyday lives. The bookyou hold in your hands, Becoming Supernatural, is the first-of-its-kind manualthat does precisely this: it leads us on a step-by-step journey to achieving ourgreatest potential in body, health, relationships, and life purpose and allowsus to make that journey at our own pace.It was in the walls of a cave on the Tibetan plateau that I saw for myself howthe same model was used by one of the great yogic masters of the past to freehis students of their own limited beliefs. The legacy of his teaching remainstoday, preserved in the native rock that provided both the home, and theclassroom, for the master eight centuries ago.image [../Images/logo.jpg]In the spring of 1998 I facilitated a group pilgrimage into the highlands ofWestern Tibet. Our route led us directly to the remote cave of the 11th-centurypoet, mystic, and yogi, Ujetsun Milarepa, known in his day simply as Milarepa.I first learned of the legendary yogi while I was a student of a Sikh mysticthat became my yoga teacher in the 1980s. For years I studied the mysterysurrounding Milarepa’s life—how he had come from a privileged family yet choseto renounce his worldly possessions; the brutal and tragic circumstances oflosing his family and loved ones to mass violence; and how his revenge, andsubsequent suffering, led to his retreat high in the Himalayan mountains, wherehe discovered his extraordinary potential as a devoted yogi. I wanted to see formyself the place where Milarepa breached the laws of physics to demonstrate tohimself, and to his students, that we are confined in our lives only by thelimits of our own beliefs. Nineteen days into my journey, I had the opportunityto do just that.After acclimating to single-digit humidity and elevations of more than 15,000feet above sea level, I found myself precisely at the place where Milarepa stoodbefore his students 800 years before. With my face only inches away from thecave’s wall, I was staring squarely into the unsolved mystery that modernscientists have never been able to explain or duplicate. It was in this exactplace that Milarepa first placed his open hand against the rock at aboutshoulder level, and then continued to push his hand further into the wall infront of him, as if the stone did not exist! When he did so, the rock beneathhis palms became soft and malleable, giving way to the pressure of his push. Theresult was a perfect impression of the yogi’s hand left in the rock for hisstudents then, and throughout the centuries, to see. Scanning our lights acrossthe walls and ceiling of the cave, we could see even more hand impressionsmaking it clear that Milarepa had offered this demonstration on more than oneoccasion.As I opened my palm and pushed it into the impression, I could feel my fingerscradled in the form of the yogi’s, precisely in the position that his hand hadassumed eight centuries earlier. The fit was so perfect that any doubt I hadabout the authenticity of the handprint quickly disappeared. It was a feelingthat was both humbling and inspiring at the same time. Immediately, my thoughtsturned to the man himself. I wanted to know what was happening to him when heengaged the rock. What was he thinking? Perhaps more importantly, what was hefeeling? How did he defy the physical “laws” that tell us a hand and the rockcan’t occupy the same place at the same time?As if he was reading my mind, my Tibetan guide answered my questions before Ieven asked him. “The geshe’s [great teacher’s] meditation teaches that he ispart of the rock, not separate from it. The rock cannot contain him. To thegeshe, this cave represents a place of experience, rather than a barrier oflimitation. In this place he is free and can move as if the rock does notexist.” My guide’s words made perfect sense. When Milarepa’s students saw theirteacher accomplish something that traditional beliefs said was not possible,they were faced with the same dilemma in their day that faces each of us todaywhen we choose to free ourselves from our own limiting beliefs.The dilemma is this: The thinking that was embraced by the family, friends, andsociety of the student’s day thought of the world in terms of limits andboundaries. This included the belief that a cave wall is a barrier to the fleshof a human body. As Milarepa pushed his hand into the rock, however, hisstudents were shown that there are exceptions to such “laws.” The irony is thatboth ways of seeing the world are absolutely correct. Each depends upon the waywe choose to think of ourselves in a given moment.As I pressed my hand into the impression that the yogi left for his studentslong ago, I asked myself: Are we confined in our lives today by the samelimiting beliefs that Milarepa’s students experienced in their day? And if so,how do we awaken the power to transcend our own limiting beliefs?I’ve found that when something is true in life, that truth shows up in manyways. For this reason it comes as no surprise that the scientific documentationfrom Joe’s classroom discoveries leads to the same conclusion that Milarepa, andmystics throughout the centuries, arrived at in the past—that the universe “is”as it is, our bodies “are” as they are, and the circumstances of our lives existas they do because of consciousness itself and the way we think of ourselves inour world. I’ve shared the story of Milarepa to illustrate this seeminglyuniversal principle.The key to the yogi’s teaching is this: when we experience for ourselves, orwitness in another person, something that we’ve once believed to be impossible,we are freed in our beliefs to transcend those limitations in our own lives. Andthis is precisely why the book you’re holding has the potential to change yourlife. By showing you how to accept your future dream as your current reality,and to do so in a way that your body believes is happening “now,” you discoverhow to set into motion a cascade of emotional and physiological processes thatreflect your new reality. The neurons in your brain, the sensory neurites inyour heart, and the chemistry of your body all harmonize to mirror the newthinking, and the quantum possibilities of life are rearranged to replace theunwanted circumstances of your past with the new circumstances that you’veaccepted as the present.And that’s the power of this book.In a style that is simple, straightforward, and easy to understand, Joe Dispenzahas woven into a single volume the paradigm-altering discoveries of quantumscience and the deep teachings that adepts of the past dedicated their entirelifetimes to master—he shows us how to become supernatural.Gregg Braden [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#ta]New York Times best-selling author ofHuman by Design and The Divine Matrix"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/line.jpg]INTRODUCTION [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#tb]Getting Ready to Become Supernatural [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#tb]image [../Images/line.jpg]I realize that writing this book is a risk for me and my reputation. There arecertain people in the world—including some in the scientific community—who mightcall my work pseudoscience, especially after Becoming Supernatural makes itsdebut. I used to be overly concerned about those critics’ opinions. In the earlydays of my career, I always wrote with skeptics in mind, trying to make surethey would approve of my work. On some level, I thought it was important to beaccepted by that community. But one day when I was standing in front of anaudience in London and a woman holding the microphone was telling her storyabout how she overcame her disease—how she healed herself through the practicesI’ve written about in other books—I had an epiphany.It became very clear that those skeptics and rigid scientists who hold their ownbeliefs about what is possible aren’t going to like me or my work no matter whatI do. Once I had that realization, I knew that I’d been wasting a lot of myvital energy. I was no longer interested in convincing that particularculture—especially those studying the normal and natural—about human potential.I was totally passionate about anything but normal, and I wanted to study thesupernatural. I got very clear that I should give up my futile efforts toconvince that community of anything and instead direct my energy to a wholeother part of the population that does believe in possibility and does want tolisten to what I have to share.What a relief it was to fully embrace that idea and to let go of any attempt tomake a difference in that other world. As I listened to the sweet lady inLondon, who wasn’t a monk or a nun or an academic or a scholar, I knew that intelling her story to the audience, she was helping others see some part ofthemselves in her. Those hearing her journey might then believe it would bepossible for them to accomplish the same. I’m at the point in my life where I amokay with people saying anything about me—and I certainly do have my flaws—but Inow know, more than ever, that I am making a difference in people’s lives. I saythat with utter humility. I have labored for years in taking complex scientificinformation and making it simple enough for people to apply to their lives.In fact, in the last four years my team of researchers, my staff, and I havegone through extensive strides to scientifically measure, record, and analyzethese transformations in people’s biology to prove to the world that commonpeople can do the uncommon. This book is about more than just healing, althoughit includes stories of people who have made significant changes in their healthand have actually reversed diseases—along with the tools you need to do thesame. These accomplishments are becoming quite common in our community ofstudents. The material you are about to read lives outside of convention and isnot usually seen or understood by most of the world. The content of this book isbased on an evolution of teachings and practices that have culminated in ourstudents’ ability to delve deeper into the more mystical of these. And ofcourse, I am hoping it will bridge the world of science with the world ofmysticism.I wrote this book to take what I’ve always thought was possible to the nextlevel of understanding. I wanted to demonstrate to the world that we can createbetter lives for ourselves—and that we are not linear beings living linearlives, but dimensional beings living dimensional lives. Hopefully, reading itwill help you understand that you already have all the anatomy, chemistry, andphysiology you need to become supernatural sitting latent within you, waiting tobe awakened and activated.In the past, I hesitated to talk about this realm of reality because I feared itmight divide an audience based on their own personal beliefs. However, I havewanted to write this book for a long time now. Over the years, I have hadprofoundly rich mystical experiences that have changed me forever. Those innerevents have influenced who I am today. I want to introduce you to that world ofdimension and show you some of the measurements we took and the studies we didin our advanced workshops around the world. I started collecting data on ourstudents in these workshops because we witnessed significant changes in theirhealth, and I knew they were changing their biology during the meditations—inreal time.We have thousands and thousands of brain scans that prove those changes were notjust imagined in their minds but actually took place in their brains. Several ofthe students we measured accomplished those changes within four days (the lengthof our advanced workshops). The scientific teams I’ve assembled have taken brainscan recordings using quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) measurementsbefore and after workshops as well as real-time measurements during themeditations and practices themselves. I was not only impressed with the changes,but shocked by them—they were that dramatic.The brains of our students function in a more synchronized and coherent fashionafter participating in the advanced retreats around the world. This increasedorder in their nervous systems helps them get very clear about a future they cancreate, and they are able to hold that intention independent of the conditionsin their external environment. And when their brains are working right, they areworking right. I will present scientific data that shows how much their brainsimproved in just a few days—which means you can do the same for your brain.At the end of 2013, something mysterious started occurring. We started seeingbrain scan recordings that puzzled the researchers and neuroscientists who cameto our events to study my work. The high amount of energy in the brain that wewere recording while a student was in certain meditations had never beenrecorded up until this point. And yet we were seeing these off-the-chartsreadings again and again.When we interviewed the participants, they reported that their subjectiveexperience during the meditation was very real and mystical, and that thiseither profoundly changed their view of the world or dramatically improved theirhealth. I knew in those moments that these participants were havingtranscendental experiences in their inner world of meditation that were morereal than anything they had ever experienced in their outer world. And we werecapturing those subjective experiences objectively.That has become a new normal for us now, and as a matter of fact, we can oftenpredict when these high amplitudes of energy in the brain will occur, based oncertain indicators and signs that we have seen for years now. In these pages, Iwant to demystify what it is to have an interdimensional experience as well asprovide the science, biology, and chemistry of the organs, systems, andneurotransmitters that make this happen. It is my hope that this informationwill give you a road map for how to create such experiences for yourself.We have also recorded amazing changes in heart rate variability (HRV). That’swhen we know a student is opening their heart and maintaining elevated emotionslike gratitude, inspiration, joy, kindness, appreciation, and compassion, whichcause the heart to beat in a coherent fashion—that is, with rhythm, order, andbalance. We know that it takes a clear intention (a coherent brain) and anelevated emotion (a coherent heart) to begin to change a person’s biology fromliving in the past to living in the future. That combination of mind and body—ofthoughts and feelings—also seems to influence matter. And that’s how you createreality.So if you’re going to truly believe in a future that you are imagining with allyour heart, let’s make sure it’s open and fully activated. Why not, throughpractice and quantitative feedback, get good at doing it and make it a skill?So we partnered with the HeartMath Institute (HMI), a sharp group of researchersbased in Boulder Creek, California, who helped us measure the responses ofthousands of our participants. It is our desire for our students to develop theability to regulate an internal state independent of the conditions in theirexternal environment and to know when they are creating heart coherence and whenthey are not. In other words, when we measure those internal changes, we cantell a person that they created a more balanced pattern in the heart measurementand that they are doing a great job and should keep doing exactly what they aredoing. Or we can let them know they are not making any biological changes andthen give them the proper instruction and provide several opportunities topractice getting better at the process. That’s what feedback does; it helps usknow when we are doing something correctly and when we aren’t.When we can change some feeling or thought inside of us, we can see changesoutside of us, and when we observe that we did it correctly, we will payattention to what we did and do it again. That action creates a constructivehabit. By demonstrating how others perform such feats, I want to show you howpowerful you can be.Our students know how to influence the autonomic nervous system (ANS)—the systemthat maintains health and balance by automatically taking care of all our bodilyfunctions while we have the free will to live our lives. It is this subconscioussystem that gives us our health and gives life to our bodies. Once we know howto gain access to this system, we can not only make our health better, but wecan also transform unwanted self-limiting behaviors, beliefs, and habits intomore productive ones. I’ll present some of the data we have been collecting foryears.We’ve also taught our students that when they create heart coherence, theirhearts create a measurable magnetic field that projects beyond their body. Thatmagnetic field is an energy, and that energy is a frequency, and all frequencycarries information. The information carried on that frequency can be anintention or thought that can influence the heart of another person at adifferent location by moving it into coherence and balance. I will show youevidence that a group of people sitting in a room together can influence otherssitting at some distance in the same room to go into heart coherence at theexact same time. The evidence clearly shows that we are bound by an invisiblefield of light and information that influences us and others.Given that, imagine what can happen when we all do this at the same time tochange the world. That’s exactly what we are up to as a community of individualswho are passionate about making a difference in the future of this Earth and thepeople and other life forms that inhabit it. We have created Project Coherence,in which thousands of people come together at the exact same time on the exactsame day to increase the frequency of this planet and of everyone who liveshere. Sound impossible? Not at all. More than 23 peer-reviewed articles and morethan 50 peace-gathering projects show such events can lower incidents ofviolence, war, crime, and traffic accidents and at the same time increaseeconomic growth.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#fm4_nt1] My wish is to show you thescience of how you can contribute to changing the world.We have also measured the energy in the room during our workshops and watchedhow it changes when you have a community of 550 to 1,500 people raising theirenergy together and creating heart and brain coherence. We have seen significantchanges time and time again. Although the instrument we use to measure this isnot approved by the scientific community in the United States, it has beenacknowledged in other countries, including Russia. In every event, we’rewonderfully surprised by the amount of energy certain groups have been able todemonstrate.We have also assessed the invisible field of vital energy surrounding the bodyof thousands of students to determine whether they can increase their own lightfield. After all, everything in our material universe is always emitting lightand information—including you. When you are living in survival mode under theburden of the hormones of stress (such as adrenaline), you draw from thisinvisible field of energy and turn it into chemistry—and as you do so, the fieldaround your body shrinks. We discovered a very advanced piece of equipment thatcan measure the emission of photons (particles of light) to determine whether aperson is building a field of light around them or diminishing their own lightfield.When more light is emitted, there’s more energy—and hence more life. When aperson has less light and information surrounding their body, they are morematter and thus emit less vital energy. Extensive research proves that thebody’s cells and various systems communicate not only by the chemicalinteractions we are familiar with, but also by a field of coherent energy(light) that carries a message (information) that causes the environment withinand all around the cell to give instructions to other cells and biologicalsystems.2 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#fm4_nt2] We’ve measured the amount of vitalenergy that our students’ bodies emit because of the inward changes they’ve madedoing our meditations, and I want to show you what changes they can create inonly four days or less.Other centers in your body besides the heart are also under the control of theautonomic nervous system—I call them energy centers. Each has its own frequency,its own intent or consciousness, its own glands, its own hormones, its ownchemistry, its own individual little brain, and so its own unique mind. You caninfluence these centers to function in a more balanced and integrated fashion.But to do that, you must first learn how to change your brain waves so you canenter this subconscious operating system. In fact, moving from beta brain waves(where the thinking brain is constantly analyzing and putting much attention onthe outer world) to alpha brain waves (which indicate you’re calmly placing moreattention on the inner world) is key. By consciously slowing your brain wavesdown, you can more readily program the autonomic nervous system. Students who’vedone my various meditation practices over the years have learned how to changetheir brain waves as well as sharpen the type of focus it takes to be presentlong enough to produce measurable effects. We’ve discovered an instrument thatcan measure those changes, and again, I’ll show you some of the research.We’ve also measured several different biological markers related to changinggene expression (a process known as making epigenetic changes). In this book,you will learn that you are not in fact beholden to your genes, and that geneexpression is changeable—once you begin to think, act, and feel differently.During our events, students leave their familiar lives for four to five days toinstead spend time in an environment that doesn’t remind them of who they thinkthey are. In doing so, they separate themselves from the people they know, thethings they own, the automatic behaviors they demonstrate in their daily lives,and the places they routinely go, and they begin to change their inner statesthrough four different types of meditations—walking, sitting, standing, andlying down. And through each one of these, they learn to become someone else.We know it’s true because our studies show significant changes in our students’gene expression, and they’ve then reported significant changes in their health.Once we can show someone measurable results proving they truly have alteredneurotransmitters, hormones, genes, proteins, and enzymes through thought alone,they can better justify their efforts and prove to themselves that they reallyare transforming.As I share these ideas with you in this book, walking you through the processand explaining the science behind the work that we’re doing and why, you’ll belearning a lot of fairly detailed information. But don’t worry: I will reviewcertain key concepts in different chapters. I do this intentionally to remindyou of what you have already learned so we can build a bigger model ofunderstanding in that moment. At times the material I present may bechallenging. Because I’ve taught this material to audiences for years, I know itcan be a lot. I’ll be reviewing and reminding you of what you’ve learned so youdo not have to go back in the book to search for the information, although youcan always review the earlier chapters if you feel you need to. Of course, allof this information will prime you for your own personal transformation. So thebetter you can wrap your mind around these concepts, the more easily you cansurrender to the meditations at the end of most of the chapters, using them astools to have your own personal experience.What’s Inside This Book?In Chapter 1 [../Text/chapter01.xhtml], I tell three stories that will give youa basic understanding of what it means to become supernatural. In the firststory, you’ll meet a woman named Anna who developed several serious healthconditions because of a trauma that keep her anchored to the past. The emotionsof stress triggered her genes, and the corresponding hormones created some verychallenging health conditions for her. It is a very tough tale. I intentionallychose this story and included all its details because I wanted to demonstrate toyou that no matter how bad things can get, you have the power to changethem—just as this amazing woman did. She applied many of the meditations in thisbook to modify her personality and heal herself. To me, she is the livingexample of truth. But she’s not the only one who has kept overcoming herself ona daily basis until she became someone else. She joins a whole student body ofparticipants who have done the same—and if they can do it, so can you.I also share two of my own personal stories here—experiences that have changedme at a very deep level. This book is as much about the mystical as it is abouthealing and creating new opportunities in our lives. I share these storiesbecause I want to prime you for what is possible when we leave this realm ofspace-time (the Newtonian world we learned about in high school science class)and activate our pineal gland so we can move into the realm of time-space (thequantum world). Many of our students have had similar mystical andinterdimensional experiences, which seemed as real as this material reality.Because the second half of the book delves into the physics, neuroscience,neuroendocrinology, and even genetics of how this happens, I hope these storieswill pique your curiosity, acting as teasers to open your mind to what’spossible. There’s a future you—a you who already exists in the eternal presentmoment—who is actually calling himself or herself to the more familiar you whois reading this book. And that future you is more loving, more evolved, moreconscious, more present, more kind, more exuberant, more mindful, more willful,more connected, more supernatural, and more whole. That is who’s waiting for youto change your energy to match his or her energy on a daily basis so you canfind that future you—who actually exists in the eternal now.Chapter 2 [../Text/chapter02.xhtml] covers one of my favorite topics. I wrote itso you could fully comprehend what it means to be in the present moment. Sinceall potentials in the fifth dimension known as the quantum (or the unifiedfield) exist in the eternal present moment, the only way you can create a newlife, heal your body, or change your predictable future is to get beyondyourself.This elegant moment—which we have witnessed in thousands of brain scans—arriveswhen a person finally surrenders the memory of themselves for something greater.So many people spend the majority of their lives unconsciously choosing to liveby the same routines on a regular basis, or they automatically romance theirpast, feeling the same way every day. As a result, they program their brain andbody to be in a predictable future or a familiar past, never living in thepresent moment. It takes practice to get there but it’s always worth the effort.Finally finding the sweet spot of the generous present moment is going torequire you to exercise a will that is greater than any of your automaticprograms, but I’ll encourage you every step of the way.The chapter starts off with a basic review of some scientific principles so wecan establish a common terminology to develop models of understanding throughoutthe book. I’m going to make it pretty simple. Talking about brain function (thatis, the mind), nerve cells and networks, different parts of the nervous system,chemicals, emotions and stress, brain waves, attention and energy, and a fewother subjects is necessary to get you where you want to go. I have to establishthe language to explain why we are doing what we are doing before I teach youhow to do it in the meditations that appear throughout the book. If you wantmore explicit, in-depth information, I invite you to read any of my previousbooks (including Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself and You Are the Placebo).Chapter 3 [../Text/chapter03.xhtml] is your introduction to the quantumworld—the fifth dimension. I want you to understand that there is an invisiblefield of energy and information that exists beyond this three-dimensional realmof space and time—and that we have access to it. In fact, once you are in thepresent moment and you’ve entered this realm, which exists beyond your senses,you are now ready to create your intended reality. When you can take all yourattention off your body, the people in your life, the objects you own, theplaces you go, and even time itself, you will literally forget about youridentity that has been formed by living as a body in this space and time.It is in this moment that you, as pure consciousness, enter the realm called thequantum field—which exists beyond this space and time. You can’t enter thisimmaterial place with your problems, your name, your schedules and routines,your pain, or your emotions. You can’t enter as some body—you must enter as nobody. In fact, once you know how to move your awareness from the known (thematerial physical world) to the unknown (the immaterial world of possibility)and you become comfortable there, you can change your energy to match thefrequency of any potential in the quantum field that already exists there.(Spoiler alert: Actually, all potential futures exist there, so you can createwhatever you want.) When a vibrational match occurs between your energy and theenergy of that potential you select in the unified field, you will draw thatexperience to you. I’ll show you how it all works.Chapter 3 [../Text/chapter03.xhtml] ends with a brief description of ameditation I have developed to help give you an actual experience of thequantum. Each of the teaching chapters from this point on will also end with abrief description of a different meditation. If you want to follow along as Iguide you, you can purchase a CD or download an audio recording of any of thesemeditations from my website, drjoedispenza.com [http://drjoedispenza.com]. Ofcourse, you can also opt to try any of the meditations in this book on your own,without listening to a recording. For this purpose, I have made free detaileddescriptions available giving the steps of each of these meditations on mywebsite at drjoedispenza.com/bsnmeditations[http://drjoedispenza.com/bsnmeditations].If you are meditating on your own, I recommend you listen to music while you doso. The best type of music is without vocals, and I prefer slow and trancing.It’s best to use music that stops you from thinking and that doesn’t evoke pastmemories. You’ll find a suggested music list on my website, mentioned earlier.In Chapter 4 [../Text/chapter04.xhtml], I introduce you to one of the mostpopular meditations in our community. It’s called the Blessing of the EnergyCenters. Each center is under the control of the autonomic nervous system. Iwill give you the science of how you can program these centers for health andthe greatest good during a meditation. If you have been doing my introductorylevel meditations where you have been placing your attention on different partsof your body and the space around your body, I want you to know that all of yourtraining was for this meditation. Practicing that has helped you sharpen yourskill to focus your attention and change your brain waves so you can enter theoperating system of the autonomic nervous system. Once you are there, you canprogram the operating system with the right orders to heal you, balance yourhealth, and improve your energy and your life.In Chapter 5 [../Text/chapter05.xhtml], I introduce you to a breath that we useat the start of many of our meditations. This breath enables you to change yourenergy, run an electrical current through your body, and create a more powerfulelectromagnetic field around you. As I will explain, most people’s energy isstored in the body because they have conditioned their body to become the mindfrom years of thinking, acting, and feeling the same way. It is thisprocess—related to living in survival mode—that causes most of the creativeenergy to be rooted in the body. Therefore, we must have a way to pull thatenergy out of the body and deliver it back to the brain, where it will beavailable for a higher purpose than mere survival.I’ll give you the physiology of the breath so you can put more intention behindit when you begin to free yourself from the past. Once you start to liberate allthat energy back into the brain, then you will learn how to recondition yourbody to a new mind. I’m going to show you how to teach your body emotionally howto live in the future-present reality instead of the past-present reality wherewe spend most of our time. Science tells us that the environment signals thegene. Since emotions are the chemical end products of experiences in ourenvironment, when you embrace elevated emotions in your meditations, you willnot only raise your body’s energy, but you will also start to signal new genesin new ways—ahead of the environment.There’s nothing like a good story or two. In Chapter 6[../Text/chapter06.xhtml], I give you a few examples of students who appliedthemselves to the meditations in the previous chapters. These case historiesshould serve as teaching tools to help you fully understand the material I havepresented so far. Most of the people you will read about are no different fromyou—they’re common people who have done the uncommon. Another reason I sharethese stories is so you can personally relate to these people. Once you have thethought If they can do it, so can I, you will naturally believe in yourselfmore. I always tell our community, “When you chose to prove to yourself howpowerful you really are, you have no idea who you will be helping in thefuture.” These people are proof that it’s possible for you.In Chapter 7 [../Text/chapter07.xhtml], I introduce what it means to createheart coherence. Like brain coherence, the heart functions in the same organizedway when we are truly present, when we can sustain elevated emotional states,and when we feel safe enough to fully open up to possibility. The brain thinks,but the heart knows. This is the center of oneness, wholeness, and unityconsciousness. It is where opposites meet, representing the union of polarities.Think of this center as your connection to the unified field. When it isactivated, you go from selfish states to selfless states. When you can maintaininternal states independent of conditions in your external environment, you aremastering your environment. It takes practice to get good at keeping your heartopen, and if you do, it will keep beating longer.Chapter 8 [../Text/chapter08.xhtml] shares one of the other favorite activitieswe do at our advanced workshops: combining a kaleidoscope with videos calledMind Movies that our students make of their future. We use the kaleidoscope toinduce a trance because when you are in trance you are more suggestible toinformation. Suggestibility is your ability to accept, believe, and surrender toinformation without any analysis. If you do this properly, it is indeed possibleto program your subconscious mind. So it makes sense that when you use thekaleidoscope to change your brain waves—with your eyes open instead of closed ina meditation—you can lower the volume of the analytical mind to open the doorbetween the conscious mind and the subconscious mind.And when you follow that with a Mind Movie—with scenes of yourself or picturesof what the future you want looks like—you program yourself into that newfuture. So many of our students have created amazing new lives and opportunitieswhen they took the time to make their Mind Movie and then watch it with thekaleidoscope. Some students are already on their third Mind Movie becauseeverything in their first two has already happened!In Chapter 9 [../Text/chapter09.xhtml], I introduce the walking meditation. Thismeditation incorporates both standing and walking. I find this practice such avaluable tool in helping us literally walk into our future. Many times we canhave an amazing seated meditation and connect to something bigger than us, butwhen we open our eyes and come back to our senses, we go unconscious again andreturn to a series of unconscious programs, emotional reactions, and automaticattitudes. I developed this meditation because I want our community to be ableto embody the energy of their future—and do it with their eyes open as well asclosed. In time as you practice this, you might naturally begin to think like awealthy person, act like an unlimited being, and feel an expansive joy forexistence because you installed the circuits and conditioned your body to becomethat person.Chapter 10 [../Text/chapter10.xhtml] shares another set of case studies toengage your level of understanding with allegory. These fascinating stories willhelp you connect the dots so you can hear the information from another angle andread about people who have experienced it firsthand. I hope they will inspireyou to do your practice with more conviction, certainty, and trust so you canexperience the truth for yourself.Chapter 11 [../Text/chapter11.xhtml] opens your mind to what’s possible in theinterdimensional world beyond the senses. In quiet moments, I often find my minddrifting to the mystical—one of my favorite topics. I love those transcendentalexperiences that are so lucid and real that I can never go back to business asusual because I know too much. During those inner events, the level of awarenessand energy is so profound that when I come back to my senses and my personality,I often naturally think to myself, I got this all wrong. The this I’m referringto is the way reality really is, not how I’ve been conditioned to perceive it tobe.In this chapter, I take you on a journey from this realm of space-time—wherespace is eternal and we experience time as we move through space—to the realm oftime-space—where time is eternal and we experience space (or spaces, or variousdimensions) as we move through time. It is going to challenge your veryunderstanding of the nature of reality. All I can say is that if you hang inthere, you will get it. It might take you a few readings to fully understand it,but as you study the material and contemplate it, your contemplation builds thecircuits in your brain in preparation for the experience.Once you are beyond your associations to this material world and you are in theunified field—chock-full of infinite possibilities—biological systems exist fortaking that energy that’s beyond the vibration of matter and turning it intoimagery in the brain. That’s where the pineal gland comes in, the subject ofChapter 12 [../Text/chapter12.xhtml]. Think of your pineal gland—a tiny glandperched in the central back area of your brain—as an antenna that can transducefrequencies and information and turn them into vivid imagery. When you activateyour pineal gland, you are going to have a full-on sensory experience withoutyour senses. That internal event will be more real to you in your mind whileyour eyes were closed than any past external experience you’ve ever had. Inother words, in order to lose yourself fully in the inward experience, it has tobe so real that you are there. When this happens, this little gland transmutesmelatonin into some very powerful metabolites that cause you to have that typeof experience. We will study the properties of this gland and then you willlearn how to activate it.Chapter 13 [../Text/chapter13.xhtml] introduces you to one of our most recentendeavors: Project Coherence. When we witnessed the measurements of so many ofour students going into heart coherence at the exact same time on the exact sameday during the exact same meditation, we knew that they were affecting eachother nonlocally (energetically, as opposed to physically). The energy they wereemitting in the form of elevated emotions carried their intention that thegreatest good happen to everyone gathered in the room. Imagine a large body ofpeople all elevating their energy and then placing the intention on that energythat lives be enriched, bodies be healed, dreams come true, futures be realized,and the mystical become common in our lives.When we saw how our students were able to open the hearts of others, we knew itwas time to start doing global meditations to help change the world. Thousandsand thousands of people from all over the world have joined in and participatedin changing and healing this planet and the people on it. After all, aren’t wedoing this work to make the world a better place? I’ll give you the science ofhow this all works—and I do mean science. Enough peer-reviewed studies on thepower of peace-gathering projects have been published to prove it works, soinstead of just studying history, why not make history?The book finishes with Chapter 14 [../Text/chapter14.xhtml], which shares somepretty wild case studies of some of the mind-blowing mystical experiences peoplehave had doing this work. Once again, I share them so you can see that even themost mystical adventures can be yours if you work at it.So, are you ready to become supernatural?"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 1 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t1]image [../Images/line.jpg]OPENING THE DOOR TO THE SUPERNATURAL [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t1]image [../Images/line.jpg]As spring was ending and the first glimpse of summer was approaching, what firstappeared to be a typical Sunday afternoon in June 2007 turned out to be anythingbut typical for Anna Willems.The French doors from the living room to the garden were open wide, and the thinwhite curtains danced lightly in the breeze as scents from the garden floatedinside. Streams of sunlight shone brightly all around Anna as she loungedcomfortably. A chorus of birds chirped and trilled outside, and Anna could hearthe distant melody of children’s laughter and playful splashing coming from aneighbor’s swimming pool. Anna’s 12-year-old son reclined on the sofa, reading abook, and she could hear her 11-year-old daughter in the room directly aboveher, singing to herself as she played.A psychotherapist, Anna worked as a manager and board member for a majorpsychiatric institution in Amsterdam whose profits totaled more than 10 millioneuros annually. She often caught up on professional reading on the weekends, andon this day she was sitting in her red leather chair reading a journal article.Little did Anna know that what looked like the perfect world to anyone peeringinto her living room that day would become a nightmare within minutes.Anna felt a bit distracted, noticing that her attention wasn’t fully engaged inthe material she was attempting to study. She set her papers down and paused,suddenly wondering again where her husband had gone. He had left the house earlythat morning while she was taking a shower. Without saying where he was headed,he had simply disappeared. The children had told her that their father had saidgood-bye, giving each of them a big hug before he left. She’d tried to reach himon his cell phone many times, but he hadn’t returned her calls. She tried onemore time—no answer. Something definitely felt odd.At 3:30 P.M. the doorbell rang, and when Anna opened the front door, she foundtwo police officers standing outside.“Are you Mrs. Willems?” one of them asked. When she confirmed that she wasindeed Mrs. Willems, the officers asked if they could come in and talk to her.Concerned and a bit confused, she complied. Then they delivered the news:Earlier that morning, her husband had jumped off one of the tallest buildings inthe center of the city. Not surprisingly, the fall was fatal. Anna and her twochildren sat in shock and disbelief.Anna’s breath momentarily stopped, and as she then gasped for air, she startedto shake uncontrollably. The moment seemed frozen in time. While her childrensat paralyzed in shock, Anna tried to hide her pain and stress for their sakes.An intense pain suddenly shot through her head, and she simultaneously felt adeep, hollow ache in her gut. Her neck and shoulders instantly stiffened as hermind frenetically raced from thought to thought. The hormones of stress hadovertaken her. Anna was now in survival mode.How Stress Hormones Take OverFrom a scientific standpoint, living in stress is living in survival. When weperceive a stressful circumstance that threatens us in some way (one for whichwe cannot predict or control the outcome), a primitive nervous system called thesympathetic nervous system turns on and the body mobilizes an enormous amount ofenergy in response to the stressor. Physiologically, the body is automaticallytapping into the resources it will need to deal with the current danger.The pupils dilate so we can see better; the heart rate and respiratory rateincrease so we can run, fight, or hide; more glucose is released into thebloodstream to make more energy available to our cells; and our blood flow isshunted to the extremities and away from our internal organs so we can movequickly if we need to. The immune system initially dials up and then dials downas adrenaline and cortisol flood the muscles, providing a rush of energy toeither escape or fend off the stressor. Circulation moves out of our rationalforebrain and is instead relayed to our hind-brain, so we have less capacity tothink creatively and instead rely more on our instinct to instantly react.In Anna’s case, the stressful news of her husband’s suicide threw her brain andbody into just such a state of survival. In the short term, all organisms cantolerate adverse conditions by fighting, hiding, or fleeing from an impendingstressor. All of us are built for dealing with short-term bursts of stress. Whenthe event is over, the body normally returns to balance within hours, increasingits energy levels and restoring its vital resources. But when the stress doesn’tend within hours, the body never returns to balance. In truth, no organism innature can endure living in emergency mode for extended periods of time.Because of our large brains, human beings are capable of thinking about theirproblems, reliving past events, or even forecasting future worst-case situationsand thus turning on the cascade of stress chemicals by thought alone. We canknock our brains and bodies out of normal physiology just by thinking about anall-too-familiar past or trying to control an unpredictable future.Every day, Anna relived that event over and over in her mind. What she didn’trealize was that her body did not know the difference between the original eventthat created the stress response and the memory of the event, which created thesame emotions as the real-life experience all over again. Anna was producing thesame chemistry in her brain and body as if the event were actually happeningagain and again. Subsequently, her brain was continuously wiring the event intoher memory bank, and her body was emotionally experiencing the same chemicalsfrom the past at least a hundred times each day. By repeatedly recalling theexperience, she was unintentionally anchoring her brain and body to the past.Emotions are the chemical consequences (or feedback) of past experiences. As oursenses record incoming information from the environment, clusters of neuronsorganize into networks. When they freeze into a pattern, the brain makes achemical that is then sent throughout the body. That chemical is called anemotion. We remember events better when we can remember how they feel. Thestronger the emotional quotient from any event—either good or bad—the strongerthe change in our internal chemistry. When we notice a significant change insideof us, the brain pays attention to whoever or whatever is causing the changeoutside of us—and it takes a snapshot of the outer experience. That’s called amemory.Therefore, the memory of an event can become branded neurologically in thebrain, and that scene becomes frozen in time in our gray matter, just as it didfor Anna. The combination of various people or objects at a particular time andplace from that stressful experience is etched in our neural architecture as aholographic image. That’s how we create a long-term memory. Therefore, theexperience becomes imprinted in the neural circuitry, and the emotion is storedin the body—and that’s how our past becomes our biology. In other words, when weexperience a traumatic event, we tend to think neurologically within thecircuitry of that experience and we tend to feel chemically within theboundaries of the emotions from the event, so our entire state of being—how wethink and how we feel—becomes biologically stuck in the past.As you can imagine, Anna was feeling a rush of negative emotions: tremendoussadness, pain, victimization, grief, guilt, shame, despair, anger, hatred,frustration, resentment, shock, fear, anxiety, worry, overwhelm, anguish,hopelessness, powerlessness, isolation, loneliness, disbelief, and betrayal. Andnone of those emotions dissipated quickly. As Anna analyzed her life within theemotions of the past, she kept suffering more and more. Because she couldn’tthink greater than how she constantly felt, and since emotions are a record ofthe past, she was thinking in the past—and every day she felt worse. As apsychotherapist, she could rationally and intellectually understand what washappening to her, but all her insights couldn’t get beyond her suffering.People in her life started treating her as the person who had lost her husband,and that became her new identity. She associated her memories and feelings withthe reason she was in her present state. When anyone asked her why she felt sobad, she told the story of the suicide—each time reliving the pain, anguish, andsuffering over again. All along, Anna kept firing the same circuits in her brainand reproducing the same emotions, conditioning her brain and body further intothe past. Every day, she was thinking, acting, and feeling as if the past werestill alive. And since how we think, how we act, and how we feel is ourpersonality, Anna’s personality was completely created by the past. From abiological standpoint, in repeatedly telling the narrative of her husband’ssuicide, Anna literally couldn’t get beyond what had happened.A Downward Spiral BeginsAnna could no longer work and had to take a leave of absence. During that time,she found out that her husband, although a successful lawyer, had made a mess oftheir personal finances. She would have to pay off significant debts that shehad previously been unaware of—and she didn’t have the money to even begin. Notsurprisingly, even more emotional, psychological, and mental stress began to addup.Anna’s mind went in circles, constantly flooded with questions: How will I takecare of our children? How will all of us deal with this trauma in our future andhow will it affect our lives? Why did my husband leave without saying good-byeto me? How could I not know that he was so unhappy? Did I fail as a wife? Howcould he leave me with two young children and how will I manage to raise them bymyself?Then judgments crept into her thoughts: He shouldn’t have committed suicide andleft me in this financial mess! What a coward! How dare he leave his childrenwithout a father! He didn’t even write a message for the children and me. I hatehim for not even leaving a note. What a jerk to leave me and make me raise thesekids alone. Did he have any idea what this might do to us? All these thoughtscarried a strong emotional charge, further affecting her body.Nine months later, on March 21, 2008, Anna woke up paralyzed from the waistdown. Within hours she was lying in a hospital bed, a wheelchair beside her,diagnosed with neuritis—inflammation of the peripheral nervous system. Afterseveral tests, the doctors could not find anything structural as the cause ofthe problem so they told Anna that she must have an autoimmune condition. Herimmune system was attacking the nervous system in her lower spine, breaking downthe protective layer that coats the nerves and causing paralysis in both of herlegs. She could not hold her urine, had difficulty controlling her bowels, andhad no feeling or motor control in her legs and feet.When the fight-or-flight nervous system is switched on and stays on because ofchronic stress, the body utilizes all its energy reserves to deal with theconstant threat it perceives from the outer environment. Therefore, the body hasno energy left in its inner environment for growth and repair, compromising theimmune system. So because of her repeated inner conflict, Anna’s immune systemwas attacking her body. She had finally physically manifested the pain andsuffering she’d emotionally experienced in her mind. In short, Anna could notmove her body because she wasn’t moving forward in her life—she was stuck in herpast.For the next six weeks, Anna’s doctors treated her with huge doses ofintravenous dexamethasone and other corticosteroids to reduce inflammation.Because of the added stress and the types of drugs she was taking—which canfurther weaken the immune system—she also developed an aggressive bacterialinfection for which her doctors gave her huge doses of antibiotics. After twomonths, Anna was released from the hospital and had to use a walker and crutchesto get around. She still could not feel her left leg and found standing verydifficult. She couldn’t walk properly. Although she could hold her bowels a bitbetter, she still couldn’t control her urine. As you can imagine, this newsituation was adding to Anna’s already high stress levels. She had lost herhusband to suicide, she could not work very much to support herself and herchildren, she was in serious financial crisis, and she had been living in ahospital paralyzed for more than two months. Her mother had to move in to help.Anna was an emotional, mental, and physical wreck, and although she had the bestdoctors and the latest medications from a reputable hospital, she was notgetting any better. By 2009, two years after the death of her husband, she wasdiagnosed with clinical depression—so she started taking even more medication.Consequently, Anna’s moods swung widely from anger to grief to pain to sufferingto hopelessness to frustration to fear to hatred. Because those emotionsinfluenced her actions, her behavior became somewhat irrational. At first, shefought with almost everybody around her except her children. But then shestarted to have conflicts with her youngest daughter.The Dark Night of the SoulIn the meantime, many more physical problems started showing up and Anna’sjourney became even more painful. The mucous membranes in her mouth started todevelop large ulcerations that spread into her upper esophagus as the result ofanother autoimmune disease called erosive lichen planus. To treat it, she had touse corticosteroid ointments in her mouth, in addition to more pills. These newmedications caused Anna’s saliva production to stop. She couldn’t eat solidfoods, so she lost her appetite. Anna was living with all three types ofstress—physical, chemical, and emotional—at the same time.In 2010, Anna found herself in a dysfunctional relationship with a man whotraumatized her and her children with verbal abuse, power games, and constantthreats. She lost all her money, her job, and her feeling of safety. When shelost her house, she had to move in with her abusive boyfriend. Stress levelscontinued climbing. Her ulcerations started to spread to other mucous membranes,including her vagina, her anus, and further down her esophagus. Her immunesystem had totally collapsed and now she was experiencing several different skinconditions, food allergies, and weight problems. Then she started havingproblems swallowing and developed heartburn, for which the doctors prescribedstill more medications.Anna started a small psychotherapy practice at home in October. She could onlyhandle seeing clients for two sessions a day in the morning after her childrenwent to school, three days a week. In the afternoon, she was so tired and sickthat she would lie in bed until her children returned from school. She tried tobe there for them as much as possible, but she had no energy and didn’t feelwell enough to leave the house. Anna hardly saw anyone. She had no social life.All the circumstances in her body and in her life constantly reminded her of howbad things were. She automatically reacted to everyone and everything. Herthinking was chaotic and she could not concentrate. She had no vitality orenergy to live anymore. Often, when she exerted herself her heart rate exceeded200 beats per minute. She found herself sweating and gasping for breath all thetime, and she felt an enormous pain in her chest on a regular basis.Anna was passing through her darkest night of the soul. Suddenly, she understoodwhy her husband had taken his life. She wasn’t sure she could go on anymore andstarted thinking of committing suicide herself. She thought, It can’t get anyworse than this . . .And then it did. In January 2011, Anna’s medical team found a tumor near theentrance of her stomach and diagnosed her with esophageal cancer. Of course,this news severely increased Anna’s stress levels. The doctors suggested arigorous course of chemotherapy. No one asked her about emotional and mentalstress; they only treated the physical symptoms. But Anna’s stress response wasfully turned on and it couldn’t turn off.It’s amazing how this can happen to so many people. Because of a shock or traumain their lives, they never get beyond those corresponding emotions, and theirhealth and their lives break down. If an addiction is something that you thinkyou can’t stop, then objectively it looks as though people like Anna becomeaddicted to the very emotions of stress that are making them sick. The rush ofadrenaline and the rest of the stress hormones arouses their brain and body,providing a rush of energy.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch1_nt1] In time, theybecome addicted to the rush of that chemistry—and then they use the people andconditions in their lives to reaffirm their addiction to the emotion, just tokeep feeling that heightened state. Anna was using her stressful conditions tore-create that rush of energy, and without realizing it, she became emotionallyaddicted to a life she hated. Science tells us that such chronic, long-termstress pushes the genetic buttons that create disease. So if Anna was turningthe stress response on by thinking about her problems and her past, her thoughtswere making her sick. And since stress hormones are so powerful, she had becomeaddicted to her own thoughts that were making her feel so bad.Anna agreed to start chemotherapy, but after her first session she had anemotional and mental breakdown. One afternoon after her kids went to school,Anna collapsed on the floor crying. She had finally reached the bottom. Itoccurred to her that if she continued this way, she would not survive for longand she would leave her children alone without either parent.She started to pray for help. She knew in her heart that something needed tochange. In utter sincerity and surrender, she asked for guidance, support, and away out, promising that if her prayers were answered, she would be thankful andgrateful every day for the rest of her life and she would help others to do thesame.Anna’s Turning PointThe choice to change became Anna’s quest. She first decided to stop all thetreatments and all the medications for her various physical illnesses, althoughshe continued to take her antidepressants. She didn’t tell the doctors andnurses that she was not coming back for treatment. She simply did not show upanymore. No one ever called her to ask why. Only her family doctor contactedAnna to express concern.On that cold winter’s day in February 2011 when Anna was on the floor crying forhelp, she made a choice with a firm intention to change herself and her life,and the amplitude of that decision carried a level of energy that caused herbody to respond to her mind. It was that decision to change that gave her thestrength to rent a house for herself and her children and move away from thenegative relationship she was in. It was as if that moment redefined her. Sheknew she had to start all over.When I first saw Anna, it was one month later. One of the few friends she hadleft had reserved a seat for Anna at a Friday evening talk that I was giving.Her friend made Anna an offer: If she liked the evening lecture, she could stayfor a full two-day weekend workshop. Anna agreed to go. The first time I sawher, she was sitting in a packed conference room on the left side on the outeraisle, her crutches leaning against the wall near where she sat.As usual, I was carrying on that night about how our thoughts and feelingsaffect our bodies and our lives. I lectured about how stress chemicals cancreate disease. I touched on neuroplasticity, psychoneuroimmunology,epigenetics, neuroendocrinology, and even quantum physics. I will go into moredetail on all of these later in this book, but for now it’s enough to know thatthe latest research in these branches of science point to the power ofpossibility. That night, filled with inspiration, Anna thought, If I created thelife I have now, including my paralysis, my depression, my weakened immunesystem, my ulcerations, and even my cancer, maybe I can uncreate everything withthe same passion I created it with. And with that potent new understanding, Annadecided to heal herself.Immediately after her first weekend workshop, she started meditating twice aday. Of course, sitting and doing the meditations was difficult at thebeginning. She had a lot of doubt to overcome, and some days she did not feelmentally and physically well—but she did her meditations anyway. She also had alot of fear. When her family doctor called to check up on her because she’dstopped her treatments and medications, he told Anna that she was being naïveand stupid and that she would get worse and die soon. Imagine the memory of anauthority figure telling you that! Even so, Anna did her meditations every dayand began to move beyond her fears. She was often consumed with financialburdens, her children’s needs, and various physical limitations, yet she neverused those conditions as an excuse to not do her inner work. She even attendedfour more of my workshops during that year.By going within and changing her unconscious thoughts, automatic habits, andreflexive emotional states—which had become hardwired in her brain andemotionally conditioned in her body—Anna was now more committed to believing ina new future than believing in her same familiar past. She used her meditations,combining a clear intention with an elevated emotion, to change her state ofbeing from biologically living in the same past to living in a new future.Every day, Anna was unwilling to get up from her meditations as the same personwho sat down; she decided that she wouldn’t finish until her whole state ofbeing was in love with life. To the materialist, who defines reality with thesenses, of course, Anna had no tangible reason to be in love with life; she wasa depressed, widowed single parent who was in financial debt and had no realjob, she had cancer and suffered from paralysis and ulcerations in her mucousmembranes, and she was in a poor living situation with no partner or significantother and no energy to tend to her children. But in the meditations, Annalearned that she could teach her body emotionally what her future would feellike ahead of the actual experience. Her body as the unconscious mind did notknow the difference between the real event and the one she was imagining andemotionally embracing. She also knew through her understanding of epigeneticsthat the elevated emotions of love, joy, gratitude, inspiration, compassion, andfreedom could signal new genes to make healthy proteins affecting her body’sstructure and function. She fully understood that if the stress chemicals thathad been coursing through her body had been turning on unhealthy genes, then byfully embracing those elevated emotions with a passion greater than thestressful emotions, she could turn on new genes—and change her health.For a year, her health didn’t change very much. But she kept doing hermeditations. In fact, she did all the meditations I designed for students. Sheknew it had taken several years to create her current health conditions, and soit would take some time to re-create something new. So she kept doing the work,striving to become so conscious of her unconscious thoughts, behaviors, andemotions that she would not let anything she did not want to experience slip byher awareness. After that first year, Anna noticed that she was slowly startingto get better mentally and emotionally. Anna was breaking the habit of beingherself, inventing a whole new self instead.Anna knew from attending my workshops that she had to move her autonomic nervoussystem back into balance because the ANS controls all the automatic functionsthat happen beyond the brain’s conscious awareness—digestion, absorption, bloodsugar levels, body temperature, hormonal secretions, heart rate, and so on. Theonly way she could slip into the operating system and affect the ANS was tochange her internal state on a regular basis.So first, Anna began each meditation with the Blessing of the Energy Centers.These specific areas of the body are under the control of the ANS. As Imentioned in the Introduction, each center has its own energy or frequency(which emits specific information or has its own consciousness), its own glands,its own hormones, its own chemistry, its own individual little mini-brain, andtherefore its own mind. Each center is influenced by the subconscious brainsitting under our conscious thinking brain. Anna learned how to change her brainwaves so she could enter the operating system of the ANS (located in themidbrain) and reprogram each center to work in a more harmonious manner. Everyday, with focus and passion, she rested her attention in each area of her bodyas well as the space around each center, blessing it for greater health and thegreater good. Slowly but surely, she began to influence her health byreprogramming her autonomic nervous system back to balance.Anna also learned a specific breathing technique I teach in our work to liberateall the emotional energy that is stored in the body when we keep thinking andfeeling the same way. By constantly thinking the same thoughts, Anna had beencreating the same feelings, and then by feeling those familiar emotions, shewould think more of the same corresponding thoughts. She learned that theemotions of the past were stored in her body, but she could use this breathingtechnique to liberate that stored energy and free herself from her past. Soevery day, with a level of intensity that was greater than her addiction to pastemotions, she practiced the breath and got better and better at doing it. Aftershe learned to move that stored energy in her body, she learned how torecondition her body to a new mind by embracing the heart-centered emotions ofher future before her future unfolded.Since Anna also studied the model of epigenetics I teach in our workshops andlectures, she learned that genes don’t create disease; instead, the environmentsignals the gene to create disease. Anna understood that if her emotions werethe chemical consequences of experiences in her environment, and if she livedevery day by the same emotions from her past, she was selecting and instructingthe same genes that might be causing her poor health conditions. If she couldinstead embody the emotions of her future life by embracing those emotionsbefore the experience actually happened, she could change her genetic expressionand actually change her body to be biologically aligned with her new future.Anna did an additional meditation that involved resting her attention in thecenter of her chest, activating the ANS with those elevated states to create andmaintain a very efficient type of heart rate we call a coherent heart rate(which I will explain in detail later in the book) for extended periods of time.She learned that when she felt resentment, impatience, frustration, anger, andhatred, those states induced the stress response and caused the heart to beatincoherently and out of order. Anna learned in my workshops that once she couldsustain this new heart-centered state, just as she had gotten used to feelingall those negative emotions on a regular basis, in time she could feel these newemotions more fully and deeply. Of course, it took quite a bit of effort totrade anger, fear, depression, and resentment for joy, love, gratitude, andfreedom—but Anna never gave up. She knew that those elevated emotions wouldrelease more than a thousand different chemicals that would repair and restoreher body . . . and she went for it.Anna then practiced a walking meditation I designed in which she walked as hernew self every day. Instead of sitting down and meditating with her eyes closed,she started these meditations standing up with her eyes closed. While standing,she got into the meditative state that she knew would change her state of being,and then while still in that state, she opened her eyes, staying in a meditativestate, and walked as her future self. By doing so, she was embodying a new habitof thinking, acting, and feeling on a regular basis. What she was creating wouldsoon become her new personality. She never wanted to go unconscious again andreturn to her old self.Because of all this work, Anna could see that her thought patterns had changed.She was no longer firing the same circuits in her brain in the same way, sothose circuits stopped wiring together and starting pruning apart. As a result,she stopped thinking in the same old ways. Emotionally, she began to feelglimpses of gratitude and pleasure for the first time in years. In hermeditations, she was conquering some aspect of her body and her mind every day.Anna calmed down and became much less addicted to the emotions derived fromstress hormones. She even started to feel love again. And she keptgoing—overcoming, overcoming, and overcoming every day on her way to becomingsomeone else.Anna Grabs Ahold of PossibilityIn May 2012, Anna attended one of my four-day progressive workshops held inupstate New York. On the third day, during the last of four meditations, shecompletely surrendered and finally let go. For the first time since she hadstarted meditating, she found herself floating in an infinite black space, awarethat she was aware of herself. She had moved beyond the memory of who she wasand became pure consciousness, totally free of her body, of her association tothe material world, and of linear time. She felt so free that she no longercared about her health conditions. She felt so unlimited that she couldn’tidentify with her present identity. She felt so elevated that she was no longerconnected to her past.In this state, Anna had no problems, she left her pain behind, and she was trulyfree for the first time. She wasn’t her name, her gender, her disease, herculture, or her profession—she was beyond space and time. She had connected to afield of information called the quantum field, where all possibilities exist.Suddenly, she saw herself in a brand-new future, standing on a huge stage,holding a microphone, and talking to a crowd as she told them the entire storyof her healing. She wasn’t imagining or visualizing this scene. It was as if shegot a download of information, a glimpse of herself as a totally different womanin a new reality. Her inner world appeared much more real to her than her outerworld, and she was having a full-on sensory experience without using her senses.The moment Anna experienced this new life in the meditation, a burst of joy andlight came into her body and she felt relief on a deep, visceral level. She knewshe was something or someone greater, much grander than her physical body. Inthis state of intense joy she felt such delight and such immense gratitude thatshe burst into laughter. And at that moment, Anna knew she was going to be okay.From then on, she developed so much trust, joy, love, and gratitude that hermeditations became easier and easier, and she began to go much deeper.As Anna moved out of her past, she felt this new energy opening her heartfurther and further. Instead of seeing her meditations as something she had todo every day, she started looking forward to them. It became her way oflife—doing the work became her habit. Her energy and vitality returned. Shestopped taking antidepressants. Her thought patterns completely changed and herfeelings were different. She felt like she was in a new state of being, so heractions changed drastically. Anna’s health and life improved tremendously thatyear.The next year, she attended several more events. By keeping connected to thework, Anna started to develop relationships with more people in our communityand she received more and more support to keep her going on her journey back tohealth. Like many of our students, she sometimes found it challenging not totake a few steps back into the old programs and the old patterns of thinking,feeling, and acting once she returned home after a workshop. But even so, shekept doing her meditations every day.In September 2013, Anna’s doctors gave her a very thorough medical checkup thatincluded many different tests. One year and nine months after her cancerdiagnosis and six years after her husband’s suicide, Anna’s cancer hadcompletely healed and the tumor in her esophagus had vanished. Her blood testsshowed no cancer markers. The mucous membranes in her esophagus, vagina, andanus were completely healed. Only a few minor problems remained: The mucousmembranes in her mouth were still slightly red, although she no longer had anyulcerations, and because of the medication she had taken for the ulcerations,she still didn’t produce saliva.Anna had become a new person—a new person who was healthy. The disease existedin the old personality. By thinking, acting, and feeling differently, Annareinvented a new self. In a sense, she had become reborn in the same life.In December 2013, Anna came to an event in Barcelona with the friend who hadintroduced her to my work. After hearing me tell the participants a story abouta remarkable healing of another student in our community, Anna decided it wastime to share her story with me. She wrote it all down and gave the letter to mypersonal assistant. Like many letters I get from students, the first line read,“You are not going to believe this.” After I read what she’d written, the nextday I asked Anna to come up onstage and share her story with the audience. Andthere she was, a year and a half after the vision she’d had during hermeditation in New York (unbeknownst to me), standing on a stage talking to anaudience about her journey healing herself.After the Barcelona event, Anna was inspired to work on her mouth even more.About six months later, I was lecturing in London and Anna attended. I spoke indetail about epigenetics. Suddenly a light went on for Anna. I’ve healed myselfof all these medical conditions—including cancer, she thought. I should be ableto signal the gene for my mouth to produce more saliva. A few months later,during another workshop in 2014, Anna suddenly felt saliva dripping in hermouth. Ever since then, Anna’s mucous membranes and her saliva production havereturned to normal. The ulcerations never came back.Today, Anna is a healthy, vital, happy, stable person with a very sharp andclear mind. Spiritually, she has grown so much that she goes very deep in hermeditations and has had many mystical experiences. She is living a life full ofcreation, love, and joy. She has become one of my corporate trainers, regularlyteaching this work to organizations and companies. In 2016, she founded asuccessful psychiatric institution, employing more than 20 therapists andpractitioners. She is financially independent and earns enough money to live arich life. She travels around the world, visits beautiful places, and meets veryinspiring people. She has a very loving and joyful partner, as well as newfriends and new relationships that honor both her and her children.When you ask Anna about her past health problems, she will tell you that havingthose challenges was the best thing that ever happened to her. Think about it:What if the worst thing that ever happened to you turns out to be the best thingthat has ever happened to you? She often tells me that she loves her presentlife, and I always respond, “Of course you do, you created your life every dayby not getting up from your meditations until you were in love with that life.So now, you get to love your life.” It was through the course of hertransformation that Anna had, in effect, become supernatural. She had overcomeher identity, which was connected to her past, and she literally created a new,healthy future—and her biology responded to a new mind. Anna is now the livingexample of truth and possibility. And if Anna healed herself, so can you.Getting MysticalHealing all sorts of physical conditions may be a very impressive benefit ofdoing this work, but it’s not the only one. Because this book is also about themystical, I want to open your mind to a realm of reality that will be just astransformative as healing but that works on a deeper and different level.Becoming supernatural can also involve embracing a greater awareness of yourselfand who you are in this world—and in other worlds as well. Let me share somestories about this from my own life to illustrate exactly what I mean and toshow you what is possible for you too.One rainy winter evening in the Pacific Northwest, as I sat on my couch after avery long day, I listened to the branches of the tall fir trees outside mywindow filtering the gusts of wind through their canopies. My children were inbed, deep asleep, and at last I had a moment to myself. As I got comfortable, Ibegan to review all the things I needed to accomplish the following day. By thetime I’d made my mental list, I was too exhausted to think so I just sat stillfor a few minutes, my mind empty. As I watched the shadows from the flames inthe fireplace flicker and dance on the walls, I began to move into trance. Mybody was tired but my mind was clear. I wasn’t thinking or analyzing anymore; Iwas simply staring into space, being in the present moment.As my body relaxed more and more, I slowly and consciously let it fall asleep asI simultaneously kept my mind conscious and awake. I wouldn’t let my attentionnarrow in on any object in the room but instead kept my focus open. This was agame I often played with myself. I liked the practice because every once in awhile, if everything lined up, I had very profound transcendental experiences.It was as if a door of sorts opened somewhere between wakefulness, sleep, andnormal dreaming and I slipped into a very lucid mystical moment. I remindedmyself to not expect anything but to simply stay open. It took a lot of patienceto not rush it or get frustrated or try to make something happen but instead toslowly slip into that other world.That day, I had finished writing an article about the pineal gland. Afterspending several months researching all the magical derivatives of melatoninthat this little alchemical center had up its sleeve, I was overjoyed aboutlinking the scientific world and the spirit world. For weeks, my entire mind hadbeen consumed with thinking about the role of the pineal metabolites as apossible connection to the mystical experiences most ancient cultures knew howto elicit, such as Native American shamanic visions, the Hindu experience ofsamadhi, and other similar rituals involving altered states of consciousness.Some concepts that had been loose ends for years had suddenly clicked for me,and my discoveries left me feeling more whole. I thought I was one step closerto understanding the bridge to higher dimensions of space and time.All the information I had learned inspired me to a deeper awareness about whatis possible for human beings. Yet I was still curious to learn more—curiousenough to move my awareness to where the pineal gland existed in my head. Icasually thought, speaking to the gland, Where are you, anyway?As I rested my attention in the space the pineal gland occupies in my brain, andas I was drifting off into the blackness, suddenly, out of nowhere, a vividimage of my pineal gland appeared in my mind as a three-dimensional round knob.Its mouth was wide open in a spasm and it was releasing a white milky substance.I was shocked by the intensity of the holographic image, but I was too relaxedto be aroused or react, so I simply surrendered and observed. It was so real. Iknew what I was seeing before me was my own tiny pineal gland.In the next instant, a huge timepiece appeared right in front of me. It was oneof those old-fashioned pocket watches with a chain, and the vision wasincredibly vivid. The moment I put my attention on the timepiece, I receivedvery clear information. I suddenly knew that linear time as I believed it tobe—with a definite past, present, and future—was not the way the world reallyworks. Instead, I understood that everything is actually happening in an eternalpresent moment. In this infinite amount of time there exist infinite spaces,dimensions, or possible realities to experience.If there is only one eternal moment happening, then it makes sense that we wouldhave no past in this incarnation, let alone no past lives. But I could see everypast and future like I was looking at an old-fashioned piece of movie film withan endless number of frames—with the frames representing not single moments butwindows of limitless possibilities that existed as scaffolding and went on inall directions forever. It was much like looking into two mirrors opposite oneanother and seeing infinite spaces or dimensions reflected in both directions.But to understand what I was seeing, imagine that those infinite dimensions areabove and below you, in front and behind you, and to your left and to yourright. And each one of those limitless possibilities already existed. I knewthat by putting my attention on any one of these possibilities, I would actuallyexperience that reality.I also realized I wasn’t separate from anything. I sensed oneness witheverything, everyone, every place, and every time. I can only describe it as themost familiar unfamiliar feeling I have ever had in my life.The pineal gland, as I soon understood I was being shown, serves as adimensional timepiece that, when activated, we can dial in to any time. When Isaw the hands of the timepiece move forward or backward, I understood that, likea time machine set to any particular time, there is also a reality or adimension to experience in a particular space. This amazing vision was showingme that the pineal gland, like a cosmic antenna, had the ability to tune in toinformation beyond our physical senses and hook us up to other realities thatalready exist in the eternal moment. While the download of information Ireceived seemed limitless, no words exist that can completely describe themagnitude of this experience.Experiencing My Past and Future Selves SimultaneouslyAs the hands of the watch moved backward to a past time, a dimension in spaceand time came to life. I immediately found myself in a reality relevant to mepersonally—although amazingly, that past moment was still occurring in thepresent moment I was experiencing while sitting on my couch in the living room.I next became aware that I was in a physical space at that specific time. Iobserved myself as a young child—again, while simultaneously having theexperience of being the adult me on the couch. The child version of me was aboutseven years old and had a very high fever. I remembered how much I loved feversat that age because I could go deep within and have the kind of abstract dreamsand visions that often come with the delirium produced by high bodytemperatures. This specific time, I was in my room in bed with the covers up tothe bridge of my nose and my mother had just left the room. I was happy I wasalone.The moment she closed the door, I somehow innately knew to do exactly what I hadjust been doing in my living room as an adult—continuously relaxing my body andremaining somewhere between sleep and wakefulness as I stayed present towhatever came up. Up to this point in my present life, I had completelyforgotten about the memory of this childhood experience, but when I lived itagain in that moment, I saw myself in the midst of a lucid conscious dream,comprehending possible realities like the squares on a chess board.As I observed myself as this young boy, I was deeply moved by what he wasattempting to understand, and I wondered how he could grasp such complicatedconcepts at his age. In that moment as I watched him, I fell in love with thatlittle guy—and the second I embraced that emotion, I somehow felt a simultaneousconnection to both that point in time and the one I was experiencing as mypresent time back in Washington State. I had such a strong knowingness that whatI was doing then and what I am doing now were happening at the same time, andthat those moments were significantly connected. In that split second, the loveI felt for him as my present self was drawing that young boy to the future I wasliving now.Then the experience got even stranger. That scene faded away and the watchappeared again. I became aware that the hands of the timepiece could also moveforward. Filled with a sense of wonder, and without any trepidation or fear, Isimply observed the watch move forward in time. Instantaneously, I was standingbarefoot in my backyard in Washington in the cold night. It’s difficult toexplain what time it was because it was the same night I was in my living room,but the me who was outside the house was the me from the future in that now.Again, words are limited here, but the only way I can explain this experience isthat the future personality called Joe Dispenza had changed immensely. I was somuch more evolved, and I felt amazing—euphoric, in fact.I was so aware—or should I say, as that person I am so aware. By aware, I meansuperconscious, as if all my senses were heightened 100 percent. Everything Isaw, touched, felt, smelled, tasted, and heard was amplified. My senses were soelevated that I was acutely aware of and paying attention to everything aroundme, wanting to experience the moment completely. And because my awarenessincreased so drastically, so did my consciousness and therefore my energy.Feeling so full of this intense energy caused me to be more conscious ofeverything I sensed simultaneously.I can describe this feeling only as consistent, unwavering, highly organizedenergy. It was nothing like the chemical emotions we normally feel as humanbeings. In fact, in that moment I knew I couldn’t even feel those normal humanemotions. I had evolved beyond them. I did, however, feel love, although it wasan evolved form of love that was not chemical but electric. I felt almost asthough I was on fire, passionately in love with life. I was in an incrediblypure form of joy.I was also walking around my backyard in the middle of winter with no shoes andno jacket—yet I was so aware of the feeling of the cold that it was actuallyintensely enjoyable. I didn’t have an opinion about how ice cold the groundunder my feet was; I just loved having my feet touch the frozen grass on theearth, and I felt very connected to both the feeling and the grass. I understoodthat if I entertained the typical thoughts and judgments I normally would haveabout being cold, it would cause me to create a sense of polarity, dividing theenergy I was experiencing. If I judged it, I would lose the feeling ofwholeness. The amazing feeling of energy that I was experiencing inside my bodywas so much greater than the conditions in my surrounding environment (thecold). And as a result, I effortlessly embraced the cold with zeal. It wassimply life! In fact, it was so pleasurable that I didn’t want the moment toend. I wanted it to last forever.I walked as this upgraded version of myself with strength and knowingness. Ifelt very empowered and calm, yet overflowing with joy for existence and lovefor life. Passing through my garden, I intentionally walked on huge basaltcolumns that were laid on their sides, stacked like huge stairs to create levelsto sit at the fire pit. I loved the experience of walking barefoot on those hugepieces of stone. I truly honored their magnificence. As I continued walking, Iapproached a fountain that I had built, and I smiled at the memory of my brotherand me creating such a marvel.Suddenly, I saw a tiny woman in a glowing white garment. She was no more thantwo feet tall, and she was standing a little behind the fountain with anotherwoman of normal size who was dressed similarly and was also radiant and full oflight. The other woman stood in the background observing, seemingly acting asthe tiny woman’s protector.When I looked at the tiny woman, she turned to me and gazed into my eyes. I feltan even stronger energy of love, as if she were sending it to me. Even as thisevolved version of myself, I realized I had never felt anything like thatbefore. The feelings of wholeness and love amplified exponentially, and Ithought to myself, Wow—is there even more love than the love I was justexperiencing moments ago? It wasn’t at all a romantic love. It was more of thatexhilarating, electrifying energy, and it was being awakened from inside of me.I knew she was acknowledging that there was indeed even more love within me toexperience. I also knew she was more evolved than I was. When I felt thatelectricity, it carried a message to look toward the kitchen window, and Iinstantly remembered why I was there.I turned and looked into the kitchen, where my present self, a few hours beforeI went to the couch to relax, was busy washing dishes. From the backyard, Ismiled. I was so in love with him. I saw his sincerity; I saw his struggles; Isaw his passion; I saw his love; I saw his mind busy, as always, constantlyattempting to dovetail concepts into meaning; and among other things, I saw someof his future. Like a great parent, I was proud of him and had nothing butadmiration for who he was in that moment. As I was feeling that intense energyincrease inside of me while I observed him, I witnessed him suddenly stopwashing the dishes and look out the window, staring out and panning thebackyard.While I was still my future self, I was able to remember the moment as mypresent self, and I remembered that I had indeed stopped and looked outside inthat instant because I felt a spontaneous feeling of love in my chest, and Isensed that I was being watched or that someone was outside. I further recalledthat while I was washing a glass, I actually leaned forward to minimize theglare in the window from the kitchen light above me and peered into the darknessfor a few minutes before returning to the remaining items in the sink. My futureself was doing to my present self what the beautiful luminous lady had done tome moments before. Now I understood why she was there.And like looking at the child in the previous scene, once again, the love thatmy future self was feeling for my present self somehow connected me to my futureself. My future me was there to call my present self to that future, and I knewthat it was love that made that bond possible. The evolved version of me hadsuch a sense of knowing. The paradox is that it is all me living at the sametime. In fact, there is an infinite number of me’s—not just the one in the past,the one in the present, and the one in the future. There are so many morepossible me’s in the realm of infinity, and there is not just one infinity butmultiple infinities. And all of this is happening in the eternal now.When I came back to physical reality as we know it on the couch, which paled incomparison to the other dimensional world I was just in, my first thought wasWow! My view of reality is so limited! The rich inner experience provided such asense of clarity and the understanding that my beliefs—that is, what I thought Iknew about life, God, myself, time, space, and what is even possible toexperience in this infinite realm—were so very limited, and I hadn’t evenrealized it until that moment. I knew I was like an infant with littlecomprehension of the magnitude of how big this thing we call reality is. Iunderstood, without fear or anxiety, what the phrase “the unknown” meant for thefirst time in my life. And I knew I would never be the same person again.I’m sure you can imagine that when something like this happens, trying toexplain it to your family or friends suggests some chemical imbalance in thebrain. I was hesitant to talk about the event to anyone because I didn’t evenhave the words to describe the experience and I didn’t want to jinx it fromhappening again. For months, I was very preoccupied with reviewing the entireprocess that I thought may have created the experience. I was also mystifiedabout the concept of time and couldn’t stop thinking about it. Aside from theparadigm shift about the eternal moment in time, I discovered something more. Irealized after the transcendental event that night, when I came back to theworld of three dimensions, that the whole experience had transpired in about 10minutes. I had just lived two extensive events, and it should have taken muchmore time for that entire experience to unfold. This time dilation furtherpiqued my interest in committing more of my energy to investigating what hadhappened to me. Once I understood more, I hoped I might be able to reproduce theexperience.For days after that important night, the center of my chest was electric in thesame way I had felt when that beautiful tiny woman activated something withinme. I kept thinking, How can this feeling still be lingering inside of me unlesssomething real happened? When I put my attention on the center of my chest, Inoticed the feeling amplify. Understandably, I wasn’t very interested in anysocial interaction during this period because the people and conditions in theouter world distracted from that feeling in my inner world, and the specialfeeling diminished. In time, it finally faded completely, but I never stoppedthinking about the idea that there is always more love to experience and thatthe energy I had embraced in that realm still lived within me. I wanted toactivate it again but I didn’t know how.For a long time, even though I tried and tried to reproduce the experience,nothing happened. I now realize that the expectation of the same outcome,combined with the frustration of trying to force it to happen, is the worstcombination for creating another mystical experience (or anything, for thatmatter). I became lost in my own personal analysis, trying to figure out how itoccurred and how I could make it happen again. I decided to add a few newapproaches. Instead of trying to re-create the experience in the evening, Idecided to wake up early in the morning and meditate. Since melatonin levels arethe highest between 1:00 A.M. and 4:00 A.M., and the mystical chemicalmetabolites of melatonin are the very substrates responsible for creating alucid event, I decided I would practice my inner work at 4 every morning.Before I share what happened next, I want to ask you to keep in mind that thiswas an unusually difficult time in my life. I was deciding whether it was worthit for me to continue to teach. I’d experienced a fair amount of chaos in mylife after appearing in the 2004 documentary What the Bleep Do We Know!? I wasconsidering stepping away from the public world and disappearing into a simplerlife. It seemed so much easier to just walk away.Living a Past Incarnation in the Present MomentOne morning about an hour and a half after I started my meditation in a seatedposition, I finally reclined. I put some pillows under my knees so I wouldn’tfall asleep too quickly, allowing me to linger between wakefulness and sleep. AsI lay down, I simply put my attention in the place the pineal gland occupies inmy head. But this time, instead of trying to make something happen, I just letgo and said to myself, Whatever . . . Apparently, that was the magic word. Iknow what that means now. I surrendered, got out of the way, let go of anyspecific outcome, and simply opened up to possibility.The next thing I knew, I was experiencing myself as a stout man in a very hotregion of the world that seemed to be in what we now call Greece or Turkey. Theterrain was rocky, the ground was parched, and stone buildings like those inGreco-Roman times were interspersed with many small tents made of brightlycolored fabrics. I was wearing a one-piece, skirted burlap garment that fellfrom my shoulders to my mid-thighs, and I had a thick rope tied around my waistlike a belt. I wore sandals roped up to my calves. I had thick curly hair and mybody felt strong. My shoulders were broad and my arms and legs were muscular. Iwas a philosopher and a longtime student of some charismatic movement.I was simultaneously the self in that experience and my present self observingme in that particular time and space. Again, I was way more conscious thannormal—I was superconscious. All my senses were heightened and I was very awareof everything. I could smell the familiar musk of my body, and I could taste thesalt of my perspiration dripping from my face. I loved the taste. I feltgrounded in the physicality and strength of my body. I was aware of deep pain inmy right shoulder but it did not consume my attention. I saw the brightness ofthe blue sky and the richness of the green trees and mountains, as if I wereliving in Technicolor. I heard seagulls in the distance, and I knew I was near alarge body of water.I was on a pilgrimage and mission of sorts. I was traveling about the countryteaching the philosophy that I had studied and lived by my whole life. I wasunder the tutelage of a grand master whom I loved very deeply because of thecare, patience, and wisdom he had given me for so many years. It was my time nowto be initiated and to deliver a message to change the minds and hearts of theculture. I knew that the message I was disseminating was counter to the currentbeliefs of that time and that the government and religious orders of the daywould challenge me.The main message of the philosophy I studied would free people from living inany type of obligation to “some thing or some one” outside of them. It wouldalso inspire individuals to demonstrate a code of principles that would empowerthem to have more enriched and meaningful lives. I was passionate about thisidealism, and I worked daily to live in alignment with the doctrines. Of course,the message would omit the need for religion and for any dependence ongovernments, and it would free people from personal pain and suffering.As the scene came to life, I had just finished addressing a crowd in arelatively populated village. The gathering was just breaking up when suddenly,several men quickly moved through the masses to arrest me. Before I could eventry to escape, I was seized. I knew that they had planned their strategy well.If they had begun to move about while I had been talking to the crowd, I wouldhave spotted them. They timed it perfectly.I surrendered without resistance, and they took me to a prison cell where I wasleft alone. Locked in a small stone cube with narrow slits for windows, I satthere knowing my destiny. Nothing I could do would prepare me for what was aboutto happen. Within two days, I was taken to the center of the city where hundredsof people gathered—many of them the same people who had listened to me speakjust a few days earlier. But now, they eagerly anticipated the chance to watchmy trial and impending torture.I was stripped to a small cloth undergarment and then strapped to a largehorizontal stone slab with large grooves notched into the corners through whichropes slid. The ropes had metal cuffs on the ends that were fastened to mywrists and ankles. Then it began. A man standing to my left started to crank alever that moved the slab slowly from a horizontal position forward to a morevertical position. As the stone block moved upward, the ropes pulled my limbstighter in all four directions.When I made it to about 45 degrees, the real pain began. Someone who seemed tobe a magistrate yelled out, asking me if I would continue teaching myphilosophy. I did not look up or answer. He then ordered the man to crank thelever further. At a certain point, I started to hear audible noises and pops,evidence of my spine dislocating in certain areas. As the observer of thisscene, I watched the look on my face as the pain increased. It was like lookinginto a mirror and seeing myself—I became acutely aware that it was me on thatslab.The metal cuffs around my wrists and ankles now tore into my skin and the sharpmetal burned. I was bleeding. One of my shoulders dislocated and I heaved andgrunted in pain. My body was convulsing and shaking as I tried to resist thetearing of my limbs by flexing and holding my muscles tight in resistance.Letting go would have been unbearable. Suddenly, the magistrate hollered outagain, asking me if I would continue to teach.I had a thought: I will agree to stop teaching, and then when they let me downfrom this public display of torture, I will simply start again. I reasoned thatthis was the right answer. It would appease the magistrate and stop the pain(and my death) while enabling me to continue my mission. I slowly shook my headfrom side to side in silence.Then the magistrate pressed me to verbally say no, but I would not speak. Hethen motioned quickly to the tormentor on my left to push the crank even harder.I looked down at the man as he turned the gears with a clear intention to hurtme. I saw his face, and as we looked into each other’s eyes, I as the observerinstantly recognized this person as someone in my present life as Joe Dispenza:the same person but in a different body. Something clicked within me as Iwitnessed this scene. I recognized that this tormentor is still tormentingothers—including me—in my current incarnation, and I understood that person’srole in my life. It was an oddly familiar feeling of knowing, and it all madeperfect sense.As the slab accelerated upward, my lower back snapped and my body started tolose control. That was the moment that broke me. I wept from the blinding pain,and I also felt such a deep sadness consume my whole being. When the weight ofthe heavy stone was released, it fell quickly back to the horizontal position. Ilay there quivering uncontrollably in silence. I was then dragged back to thesmall prison cell, where I lay curled up in the corner. For three days, Icouldn’t stop the flashbacks of my torture.I was so humiliated that I never could speak in public again. The very thoughtof returning to my mission created such a visceral response in my body that Istopped even thinking about it. One night they released me, and without beingnoticed, head down in utter shame, I disappeared. I was unable to look anyone inthe eye ever again. I felt like I had failed in my mission. I spent the rest ofmy life in a cave by the sea, trapping fish and living in silence as a hermit.As I witnessed this poor man’s plight and his choice to hide from the world, Iunderstood that this was a message for me. I knew that in my present life Icould not disappear and hide from the world again and that my soul wanted me tosee that I had to continue my work. I had to make the effort to stand up for amessage and never again retract from adversity. I also recognized that I hadn’tfailed at all—I had done my best. I knew that the young philosopher still livedin the eternal present moment as a myriad of possible me’s and that I couldchange my future, and his, by never again being afraid to live for the truthinstead of dying for it.Each of us has myriad possible incarnations that exist in the eternal presentmoment, all waiting to be discovered. When the mystery of the self is unveiled,we can wake up to the understanding that we are not linear beings living alinear life but instead dimensional beings living dimensional lives. The beautybehind the infinite probabilities that await us is that the only way we canchange those futures is to change ourselves in the present infinite moment."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 2 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t2]image [../Images/line.jpg]THE PRESENT MOMENT [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t2]image [../Images/line.jpg]If you want to experience the supernatural in your own life—by healing yourbody, creating new opportunities you could never have imagined before, andhaving transcendent, mystical experiences—you first need to master the conceptof the present moment: the eternal now. There’s a lot of talk about beingpresent or being in the now these days. While most people understand the basicsof what that means (not to think about the future or live in the past), I wantto offer you a completely different understanding of the concept. It’s going torequire that you get beyond the physical world—including your body, youridentity, and your environment—and even beyond time itself. This is where youturn possibility into reality.After all, if you don’t get beyond who you think you are and the way you’ve beenconditioned to believe the world works, it’s not possible to create a new lifeor a new destiny. So in a very real sense, you have to get out of your own way,transcend the memory of yourself as an identity, and allow something greaterthan you, something mystical, to take over. In this chapter, I’m going toexplain how that works.First, let’s take a look at how the brain functions. When any neurologicaltissue in the brain or the body is activated, it creates mind. Consequently,from a neuroscientific understanding, mind is the brain in action. For instance,you have a specific mind to drive your car. You have another mind to take ashower. You have a different mind when you sing a song or listen to music. Youuse a specific level of mind to execute each of those complex functions becauseyou’ve probably done each of these tasks thousands of times, so your brain turnson in a very specific way whenever you do any of them.When your brain is in action as you drive your car, for example, you are in factturning on a specific sequence, pattern, and combination of neurologicalnetworks. Those neural networks (or neural nets) are simply clusters of neuronsthat work together as a community—just like an automatic software program or amacro—because you’ve done that particular action so many times. In other words,the neurons that fire together to accomplish the task become more wiredtogether.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch2_nt1] As you consciously choose to performthe task of driving your vehicle, we could say that you are automaticallyselecting and instructing those neurons in your brain to turn on to create alevel of mind.For the most part, your brain is a product of the past. It has been shaped andmolded to become a living record of everything you have learned and experiencedup to this point in your life. Learning, from a neuroscientific standpoint, iswhen neurons in your brain assemble to form thousands of synaptic connectionsand those connections then assemble into complex, three-dimensional neurologicalnetworks. Think of learning as your brain getting an upgrade. When you payattention to knowledge or information and it makes sense to you, thisinteraction with the environment leaves biological impressions in your brain.When you experience something new, your senses write the story neurologically inyour brain and even more neurons come together to make even more enrichedconnections, upgrading your brain even further.Experiences not only enhance the brain circuitry, but they also create emotions.Think of emotions as the chemical residue from past experiences—or chemicalfeedback. The stronger the emotional quotient from an event in your life, themore the experience leaves a lasting impression in your brain; that’s howlong-term memories are formed. So if learning means making new connections inyour brain, memories are when you maintain those connections. The more yourepeat a thought, choice, behavior, experience, or emotion, the more thoseneurons fire and wire together and the more they will sustain a long-termrelationship.In Anna’s story in the previous chapter, you learned most of your experiencescome from your interaction with your external environment. Since your sensesplug you into the external environment and neurologically record the narrativein your brain, when you experience a highly charged emotional event—bad orgood—that moment becomes embossed neurologically in your brain as a memory.Therefore, when an experience changes how you normally feel chemically andheightens your attention to what caused it, you will associate a specific personor thing with where your body is at a particular time and place. That’s how youcreate memories by interacting with the outer world. It’s safe to say that theonly place the past actually exists is in your brain—and in your body.How Your Past Becomes Your FutureLet’s take a closer look at what happens biochemically inside your body when youthink a thought or feel an emotion. When you think a thought (or have a memory),a biochemical reaction begins in your brain causing the brain to release certainchemical signals. That’s how immaterial thoughts literally become matter—theybecome chemical messengers. These chemical signals make your body feel exactlythe way you were just thinking. Once you notice you are feeling a particularway, then you generate more thoughts equal to how you’re feeling, and then yourelease more chemicals from your brain to make you feel the way you’ve beenthinking.For example, if you have a fearful thought, you start to feel fear. The momentyou feel fear, that emotion influences you to think more fearful thoughts, andthose thoughts trigger the release of even more chemicals in the brain and bodythat make you continue to feel more fear. The next thing you know, you getcaught in a loop where your thinking creates feeling and your feeling createsthinking. If thoughts are the vocabulary of the brain and feelings are thevocabulary of the body, and the cycle of how you think and feel becomes yourstate of being, then your entire state of being is in the past.When you fire and wire the same circuits in your brain over and over againbecause you keep thinking the same thoughts, you are hardwiring your brain intothe same patterns. As a result, your brain becomes an artifact of your pastthinking, and in time it becomes easier to automatically think in the same ways.At the same time, as you repeatedly feel the same emotions over and overagain—since as I just said, emotions are the vocabulary of the body and thechemical residue of past experiences—you are conditioning your body into thepast.So now let’s look at what that means for you on a day-to-day basis. Given whatyou just learned about feelings and emotions being the chemical end products ofpast events, the moment you wake up in the morning and search for the familiarfeeling called you, you are starting your day in the past. So when you start tothink about your problems, those problems—which are connected to the memories ofpast experiences of different people or things at certain times andplaces—create familiar feelings such as unhappiness, futility, sadness, pain,grief, anxiety, worry, frustration, unworthiness, or guilt. If those emotionsare driving your thoughts, and you cannot think greater than how you feel, thenyou are also thinking in the past. And if those familiar emotions influence thechoices you are going to make that day, the behaviors you’re going to exhibit,or the experiences you are going to create for yourself, then you’re going toappear predictable—and your life is going to stay the same.Now let’s say after you wake up, you turn off your alarm, and as you lie therein bed, you check your Facebook, your Instagram, your WhatsApp, your Twitter,your texts, your e-mails, and then the news. (Now you are really remembering whoyou are as you reaffirm your personality and connect to your past-presentpersonal reality.) Then you go to the bathroom. You use the toilet, brush yourteeth, take a shower, get dressed, and then head for the kitchen. You drink somecoffee and eat breakfast. Maybe you watch the news or check your e-mail again.It’s the same routine you follow every day.Then you drive to work using the same old route, and when you get there youinteract with the same coworkers you saw the day before. You spend your dayperforming pretty much the same duties you performed yesterday. You might evenreact to the same challenges at work with the same emotions. Then after work,you drive home; maybe you stop at the same grocery store and buy the food youlike and always eat. You cook the same food for dinner and watch the sametelevision show at the same time while sitting in the same place in your livingroom. Then you get ready for bed in the same way you always do—you brush yourteeth (with your right hand starting from the upper right side of your mouth),you crawl into the same side of the bed, maybe you read a little, and then yougo to sleep.If you keep doing these same routines over and over again, they will become ahabit. A habit is a redundant set of automatic, unconscious thoughts, behaviors,and emotions that you acquire through frequent repetition. Basically, it meansyour body is now on autopilot, running a series of programs, and over time, yourbody becomes the mind. You’ve done this routine so many times that your bodyautomatically knows how to do certain things better than your brain or consciousmind. You just switch on the autopilot and go unconscious, which means you’llwake up the next the morning and essentially do the same things all over again.In a very real sense, your body is dragging you into the same predictable futurebased on what you have been repeatedly doing in the same familiar past. You willthink the same thoughts and then make the same choices that lead to the samebehaviors that create the same experiences that produce the same emotions. Overtime, you’ve created a set of hardwired neurological networks in the brain andyou have emotionally conditioned your body to live in the past—and that pastbecomes your future.If you were looking at a timeline of your day, starting with waking up in themorning and continuing until you go to bed that night, you could pick up thattimeline of yesterday or today (your past) and place it in the space reservedfor tomorrow (the future) because essentially the same actions you took todayare the ones you are going to take tomorrow—and the day after that, and the dayafter that. Let’s face it: If you keep the same routine as yesterday, it makessense that your tomorrow is going to be a lot like your yesterday. Your futureis just a rerun of your past. That’s because your yesterday is creating yourtomorrow.Take a look at Figure 2.1 [../Text/chapter02.xhtml#fig2.1]. Each of thosevertical lines represents the same thought that leads to the same choice thatinitiates an automatic behavior that creates a known experience that produces afamiliar feeling or an emotion. If you keep reproducing the same sequence, intime all those individual steps merge into one automatic program. This is howyou lose your free will to a program. The arrow represents an unknown experiencedropping in somewhere between you driving to work in traffic, knowing you aregoing to be late again, and you trying to stop by the dry cleaner’s on your way.We could say that your mind and body are in the known—the same predictablefuture based on what you did in the same familiar past—and in that known,certain future there’s no room for the unknown. In fact, if something newhappened, if something unknown were to unfold in your life at that moment tochange the same predictable timeline of your day, you’d probably be annoyed atthe disruption of your routine. You’d likely consider it troublesome,problematic, and downright inconvenient. You might say, “Can you come backtomorrow? This is not the right time.”image [../Images/p62.jpg]A habit is a redundant set of automatic unconscious thoughts, behaviors, andemotions that develop through repetition. It’s when you’ve done something somany times that your body is programmed to become the mind. Over time, your bodyis dragging you to a predictable future based on what you’ve been doing in thepast. Therefore, if you’re not in the present moment, you’re probably in aprogram.The fact is, there’s no room for the unknown in a predictable life. But beingpredictable is not how the unknown works. The unknown is unfamiliar,uncertain—but it’s also exciting because it occurs in ways you cannot expect oranticipate. So let me ask you: How much room in your routine, predictable lifedo you have for the unknown?By staying in the known—following the same sequence each day of thinking thesame thoughts, making the same choices, demonstrating the same programmedhabits, re-creating the same experiences that stamp the same networks of neuronsinto the same patterns to reaffirm the same familiar feeling called you—you arerepeating the same level of mind over and over again. In time, your brainbecomes automatically programmed to do any one of those particular sequencesmore easily and effortlessly the next time, and then the next time, and so on.As each of these individual steps merge into one complete step, thinking afamiliar thought of an experience of somebody or something at some place in sometime will automatically create the anticipation of the feeling of theexperience. If you can predict the feeling of any experience, you are still inthe known. For instance, the thought of having a meeting with the same team ofpeople you have worked with for years can automatically cause you to call up theemotion of what that future event will feel like. When you can predict thefeeling of that future event—because you’ve had enough past experiences to makeit known to you—you are probably going to be creating more of the same. And ofcourse, you are right. But that’s because you are the same. By the same means,if you are in the automatic program and you cannot predict the feeling of anexperience in your life, you will probably be hesitant to engage it.We need to look at one more aspect of thinking and feeling to get the fullpicture of what’s happening when you keep living in the same state of being.This thinking-feeling loop also produces a measurable electromagnetic field thatsurrounds our physical bodies. In fact, our bodies are always emitting light,energy, or frequencies that carry a specific message, information, or intention.(By the way, when I say “light,” I am not just referring to the light we see butto all spectrums of light—including x-rays, cell phone waves, and microwaves.)In the same way, we also receive vital information that is carried on differentfrequencies. So we are always sending and receiving electromagnetic energy.Here’s how that works. When we think a thought, those networks of neurons thatfire in our brain create electrical charges. When those thoughts also cause achemical reaction that results in a feeling or an emotion, as well as when afamiliar feeling or emotion is driving our thoughts, those feelings createmagnetic charges. They merge with the thoughts that create the electric chargesto produce a specific electromagnetic field equal to your state of being.2[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch2_nt2]Think of emotions as energy in motion. When someone experiencing a strongemotion walks into a room, their energy (aside from their body language) isoften very palpable. We have all felt another person’s energy and intent whenthey were angry or very frustrated. We felt it because they were emitting astrong signal of energy that carried specific information. The same is true of avery sexual person, a person who is suffering, or a person who has a calm,loving energy: All those energies can be sensed and felt. As you might expect,different emotions produce different frequencies. The frequencies of creative,elevated emotions like love, joy, and gratitude are much higher than theemotions of stress, such as fear and anger, because they carry different levelsof conscious intent and energy. (See Figure 2.2, which details some of thedifferent frequencies associated with various emotional states.) You’ll readmore about this concept later in the book.image [../Images/p64.jpg]Emotions are energy in motion. All energy is frequency and all frequency carriesinformation. Based on our own personal thoughts and feelings, we are alwayssending and receiving information.So if we are re-creating the past day after day, thinking the same thoughts andfeeling the same emotions, we are broadcasting the same electromagnetic fieldover and over again—sending out the same energy with the same message. From theperspective of energy and information, this means the same energy of our pastcontinues to carry the same information, which then keeps creating the samefuture. Our energy, then, is essentially equal to our past. The only way we canchange our lives is to change our energy—to change the electromagnetic field weare constantly broadcasting. In other words, to change our state of being, wehave to change how we think and how we feel.image [../Images/p65.jpg]If where you place your attention is where you place your energy, the moment youput your attention on familiar feelings and memories, you are siphoning yourenergy into the past and out of the present moment. In the same way, if yourattention is constantly on all the people you have to see, the places you haveto go, the things you have to do at certain times in your known familiarreality, then you are siphoning your energy out of the present moment and intothe predictable future.If where you place your attention is where you place your energy (a key conceptyou’ll read more about later in this chapter), then the moment you place yourattention on a familiar emotion, your attention and your energy are in the past.If those familiar emotions are connected to a memory of some past eventinvolving a person or an object at a particular place and time, then yourattention and your energy are in the past as well. As a consequence, you aresiphoning your energy out of the present moment into your past. By the samemeans, if you start to think about all the people you have to see, the thingsyou have to do, and the places you have to go at certain times in your routineday, you are siphoning your attention and energy into a predictable knownfuture. Take a look at Figure 2.3, which illustrates this point.All of your energy is now completely comingled with those known experiences inthat specific line of time. Your energy is creating more of the same and yourbody is going to follow your mind to the same events in your same reality. Yourenergy is being directed out of the present moment and into the past and thefuture. As a result, you have very little energy left to create an unknownexperience in a new timeline.Figure 2.3 also shows how the electromagnetic energy you emanate is avibrational match with everything known to you. So as you start your day, whenyou have the thought of the toilet, the next thing you know there you arewalking toward the toilet. Then you have the thought of the shower and you findyourself in the shower, adjusting the water temperature. You have the thought ofthe coffeemaker and you’re projecting your attention and energy to thecoffeemaker, and as you automatically walk to the kitchen to make your morningcup of java, once again your body is following your mind. And if you’ve donethat for the last 22 years, your body is going to effortlessly coast right overthere. Your body is always following your mind—but in this case, it’s beenrepeatedly following your mind to the known. That’s because that’s where yourattention—and therefore your energy—is.So now let me ask you this: Could it ever be possible for your body to startfollowing your mind to the unknown? If so, you can see that you would have tochange where you put your attention, and that would lead to changing yourenergy, which would require you to change how you think and how you feel longenough for something new to happen. While it may sound incredible, this isindeed possible. It makes sense that just as your body has been following yourmind to every known experience in your life (like the coffeemaker each morning),if you were to start investing your attention and energy into the unknown, yourbody would then be able to follow your mind into the unknown—a new experience inyour future.Priming Your Mind and Body for a New FutureIf you are familiar with my work, you know that I’m in love with the concept ofmental rehearsal. I am fascinated by how we can change the brain as well as thebody by thought alone. Think about that for a moment. If you focus yourattention on specific imagery in your mind and become very present with asequence of repeated thoughts and feelings, your brain and body will not knowthe difference between what is occurring in the outer world and what ishappening in your inner world. So when you’re fully engaged and focused, theinner world of imagination will appear as an outer-world experience—and yourbiology will change accordingly. That means you can make your brain and bodylook as if a physical experience has already happened without having the actualexperience. What you put your attention on and mentally rehearse over and overagain not only becomes who you are from a biological perspective, it alsodetermines your future.Here’s a good example. A team of Harvard researchers took a group of volunteerswho had never before played the piano and divided the group in half. One halfpracticed a simple five-finger piano exercise for two hours a day over a periodof five days. The remaining half did the same thing, but just by imagining theywere sitting at the piano—without physically moving their fingers in any way.The before-and-after brain scans showed that both groups created a dramaticnumber of new neural circuits and new neurological programming in the region oftheir brains that controls finger movements, even though one group did so bythought alone.3 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch2_nt3]Think about this. The folks who mentally rehearsed the actions had brains thatlooked like the experience had already happened—even though they never lifted afinger. If you were to put them in front of a piano after five days of mentalrehearsal, many of them would be able to play the exercise they imagined prettywell, even though they had never before tickled the ivories. By mentallyimagining the activity every day, they installed the neurological hardware inpreparation for the experience. They repeatedly fired and wired those braincircuits with their attention and intention, and over time the hardware becamean automatic software program in their brains and it became easier to do thenext time. So if they were to start to play after five days of mental practice,their behaviors would become easily aligned with their conscious intentionsbecause they primed their brains for the experience ahead of time. That’s howpowerful the mind can be, once trained.Similar studies show the same kinds of results with muscle training. In apioneering study at the Cleveland Clinic, ten research subjects between the agesof 20 and 35 imagined flexing one of their biceps as hard as they could in fivetraining sessions a week for 12 weeks. Every other week, the researchersrecorded the subjects’ electrical brain activity during their sessions andmeasured their muscle strength. By the end of the study, the subjects hadincreased their biceps’ strength by 13.5 percent, even though they hadn’tactually been using their muscles at all. They maintained this gain for threemonths after the training sessions stopped.4 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch2_nt4]More recently, a research team made up of scientists from the University ofTexas at San Antonio, the Cleveland Clinic, and the Kessler Foundation ResearchCenter in West Orange, New Jersey, asked subjects to visualize contracting theirelbow flexor muscles. As they did so, they were instructed to urge the musclesto flex as strong and hard as possible—adding a firm intention to their strongmental energy—for 15-minute sessions, five days a week, for 12 weeks. One groupof subjects was instructed to use what is called external or third-personimagery, imagining themselves performing the exercise by observing themselves ina scene in their heads separate from the experience (like watching a movie ofthemselves). A second group was instructed to use internal or first-personimagery, imagining that their bodies as they existed right then in real timewere doing the exercise, making it more immediate and realistic. A third group,the control, did no practice. The group using external imagery (as well as thecontrol group) showed no significant change, but the group using internalimagery showed a 10.8 percent increase in strength.5[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch2_nt5]Another team of researchers from Ohio University went so far as to wrap thewrists of 29 volunteers in surgical casts for one month, ensuring they wouldn’tbe able to move their wrists even unintentionally. Half the group practicedmental-imagery exercises for 11 minutes a day, five days a week, imagining theywere flexing their immobilized wrist muscles while actually remaining completelystill. The other half, the control group, did nothing. At the end of the month,when all the casts came off, the muscles of the imagery group were twice asstrong as those of the control group.6 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch2_nt6]Each of these three muscle studies shows how mental rehearsal not only changesthe brain, but can also change the body by thought alone. In other words, bypracticing the behaviors in their mind and consciously reviewing the activity ona regular basis, the bodies of the subjects looked like they had been physicallyperforming the activity—and yet they never did the exercises. Those who addedthe emotional component of doing the exercise as hard as possible to theintensity of the mental imagery made the experience even more real and theresults more pronounced.In the piano-playing study, the brains of the research subjects looked as thoughthe experience they’d imagined had already happened because they had primedtheir brains for that future. In a similar way, the subjects in themuscle-flexing studies changed their bodies to look as if they had previouslyexperienced that reality—just by mentally rehearsing the activity throughthought alone. You can see why when you wake up in the morning and startthinking about the people you have to see, the places you have to go, and thethings you have to do in your busy schedule (that’s mentally rehearsing), andthen you add an intense emotion to it like suffering or unhappiness orfrustration, just like the elbow flexor volunteers who urged their muscles toflex without moving them at all, you are conditioning your brain and body tolook like that future has already happened. Since experience enriches the brainand creates an emotion that signals the body, when you continuously create aninward experience that is as real as an outer experience, over time you’re goingto change your brain and body—just like any real experience would.In fact, when you wake up and start thinking about your day, neurologically,biologically, chemically, and even genetically (which I will explain in the nextsection), it looks as though that day has already happened for you. And in fact,it has. Once you actually start the day’s activities, just as in the experimentsabove, your body is naturally and automatically going to behave equal to yourconscious or unconscious intentions. If you’ve been doing the same things foryears on end, those circuits—as well as the rest of your biology—are morereadily and easily activated. That’s because not only do you prime your biologyevery day with your mind, but you also re-create the same physical behaviors inorder to reinforce those experiences further in your brain and body. And itactually becomes easier to go unconscious every day because you keep mentallyand physically reinforcing the same habits over again—creating the habit ofbehaving by habit.Making Genetic ChangesWe used to think that genes created disease and that we were at the mercy of ourDNA. So if many people in someone’s family died of heart disease, we assumedthat their chances of also developing heart disease would be pretty high. But wenow know through the science of epigenetics that it’s not the gene that createsdisease but the environment that programs our genes to create disease—and notjust the external environment outside our body (cigarette smoke or pesticides,for example), but also the internal environment within our body: the environmentoutside our cells.What do I mean by the environment within our body? As I said previously,emotions are chemical feedback, the end products of experiences we have in ourexternal environment. So as we react to a situation in our external environmentthat produces an emotion, the resulting internal chemistry can signal our genesto either turn on (up-regulating, or producing an increased expression of thegene) or to turn off (down-regulating, or producing a decreased expression ofthe gene). The gene itself doesn’t physically change—the expression of the genechanges, and that expression is what matters most because that is what affectsour health and our lives. Thus, even though someone may have a geneticpredisposition for a particular disease, for example, if their genes continue toexpress health instead of expressing that disease, they won’t develop thecondition and will remain healthy.Think of the body as a finely tuned instrument that produces proteins. Every oneof our cells (except red blood cells) makes proteins, which are responsible forthe body’s physical structure and physiological function. For example, musclecells make specific proteins known as actin and myosin, and skin cells make theproteins collagen and elastin. Immune cells make antibodies, thyroid cells makethyroxine, and bone-marrow cells make hemoglobin. Some of our eye cells makekeratin, while our pancreatic cells make enzymes like protease, lipase, andamylase. There isn’t an organ or a system in the body that does not rely on orproduce proteins. They are a vital part of our immune system, digestion,cellular repair, and bone and muscle structure—you name it, they’re a part ofit. In a very real way, then, the expression of proteins is the expression oflife and is equal to the health of the body.In order for a cell to make a protein, a gene must be expressed. That’s the jobof the genes, to facilitate making proteins. When the signal from theenvironment outside of the cell reaches the cell membrane, the chemical isaccepted by a receptor outside of the cell and makes its way to the DNA insidethe cell. Then a gene makes a new protein that’s equal to that signal. So if theinformation coming from outside of the cell does not change, the gene keepsmaking the same protein and the body stays the same. Over time, the gene willbegin to down-regulate; it will either shut off its healthy expression ofproteins or it will eventually wear out, like making a copy of a copy of a copy,causing the body to express a different quality of proteins.Different classifications of stimuli up-regulate and down-regulate genes. Weactivate experience-dependent genes, for example, by doing new things orlearning new information. These genes are responsible for stem cells getting theinstructions to differentiate, transforming into whatever type of cell the bodyneeds at that particular time to replace cells that are damaged. We activatebehavioral state–dependent genes when we are in high levels of stress orarousal, or in alternate states of awareness, like dreaming. You can think ofthese genes as the fulcrum of mind-body connection because they provide a linkbetween our thoughts and our bodies, allowing us to influence our physicalhealth through various behaviors (meditation, prayer, or social rituals, forexample). When genes are altered in this way, sometimes within minutes, thosealtered genes can then be passed on to the next generation.So when you change your emotions, you can change the expression of your genes(turning some on and others off) because you are sending a new chemical signalto your DNA, which can then instruct your genes to make differentproteins—up-regulating or down-regulating to make all kinds of new buildingblocks that can change the structure and function of your body. For example, ifyour immune system has been subject to living in the emotions of stress for toolong and has certain genes activated for inflammation and disease, you can turnon new genes for growth and repair and switch off the old genes responsible fordisease. And at the same time, these epigenetically altered genes will begin tofollow new instructions, making new proteins and programming the body forgrowth, repair, and healing. This is how you can successfully recondition yourbody to a new mind.So as you read earlier in this chapter, this means that if you’re living by thesame emotions day in and day out, your body believes it’s in the sameenvironmental conditions. Then those feelings influence you to make the samechoices, causing you to demonstrate the same habits that then create the sameexperiences that then produce the same emotions all over again. Thanks to theseautomatic, programmed habits, your cells are constantly being exposed to thesame chemical environment (outside your body in your environment as well asoutside the cells but within your body). That chemistry keeps signaling the samegenes in the same way—and so you’re stuck because when you stay the same, yourgenetic expression stays the same. And now you are headed for a genetic destinybecause you don’t have any new information coming from the environment.But what if the circumstances in your life change for the better? Shouldn’t thatalso change the chemical environment surrounding your cells? Yes, that happens,but not all the time. If you’ve spent years conditioning your body to this cycleof thinking and feeling, and then feeling and thinking, without realizing ityou’ve also conditioned your body to become addicted to these emotions. Sosimply changing the external environment by, say, getting a new job doesn’tnecessarily break that addiction any more than someone addicted to drugs wouldbe able to stop their cravings just by winning the lottery or moving to Hawaii.Because of the thinking-feeling loop, sooner or later—after the novelty of theexperience is over—most people return to their baseline emotional state, and thebody believes it is in the same old experience that created the same oldemotions.So if you were miserable in your old job but managed to get a new one, you mightbe happy for a few weeks or even a few months. But if you had spent yearsconditioning your body to be addicted to misery, you would eventually return tothat old emotion because your body would crave its chemical fix. Your outerenvironment may have changed, but your body will always believe its internalchemistry more than its external conditions, so it remains emotionally lockedinto your old state of being, still addicted to those old emotions. That’s justanother way of saying you’re still living in the past. And because that internalchemistry hasn’t changed, you can’t change the expression of your genes to makenew proteins in order to improve the structure or the function of your body, sothere’s no change in your health or your life. That’s why I say you have tothink greater than the way you feel to make any real, lasting changes.In the winter of 2016, at our advanced workshop in Tacoma, Washington, my teamand I performed a study on the effect elevated emotions had on immune function,taking saliva samples from 117 test subjects at the start of the workshop andthen again four days later at the workshop’s conclusion. We measuredimmunoglobulin A (IgA), a protein marker for the strength of the immune system.IgA is an incredibly powerful chemical, one of the primary proteins responsiblefor healthy immune function and the internal defense system. It’s constantlyfighting a barrage of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms that invadeor are already living within the body’s internal environment. It’s so powerfulthat it’s better than any flu shot or immune system booster you could possiblytake; when it’s activated, it’s the primary internal defense system in the humanbody. When stress levels (and therefore the levels of stress hormones likecortisol) go up, this lowers levels of IgA, thereby compromising anddown-regulating the immune system’s expression of the gene that makes thisprotein.During our four-day workshop, we asked our study participants to move into anelevated emotional state such as love, joy, inspiration, or gratitude for nineto ten minutes three times a day. If we could elevate our emotions, we wondered,could we boost our immune system? In other words, could our students up-regulatethe genes for IgA simply by changing their emotional states?The results amazed us. Average IgA levels shot up by 49.5 percent. The normalrange for IgA is from 37 to 87 milligrams per deciliter (mg/ dL), but somepeople measured more than 100 mg/dL at the end of the workshop.7[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch2_nt7] Our test subjects showed significant,measurable epigenetic changes without having any significant experiences intheir external environment. By attaining states of elevated emotion even forjust a few days, their bodies began to believe that they were in a newenvironment, so they were able to signal new genes and change their geneticexpression (in this case, the protein expression of the immune system). (SeeFigure 2.4.)image [../Images/p73.jpg]As we practice maintaining elevated emotions and changing our energy, we canliterally up-regulate new genes that make new healthy proteins to strengthen ourinternal defense system. As we reduce our survival emotions, and minimize theneed for our external protection system, we down-regulate genes for theproduction of stress hormones. (SIgA in the figure above stands for salivaryimmunoglobulin A; cortisol represents stress hormones. Both were measured insaliva.)This means that you might not need a pharmacy or an exogenous substance to healyou—you have the power from within to up-regulate the genes that make IgA withina few days. Something as simple as moving into an elevated state of joy, love,inspiration, or gratitude for five to ten minutes a day can produce significantepigenetic changes in your health and body.Where Attention Goes, Energy FlowsSince where you place your attention is where you place your energy, when youwake up in the morning and immediately start putting your attention and energyon all the people you have to see that day, the places you have to go, theobjects you own, and the things you have to do in the three-dimensional world,your energy becomes fractured. All of your creative energy is flowing away fromyou, as Figure 2.5 illustrates, to all the things in the outer world thatcompete for your attention—your cell phone, your laptop, your bank account, yourhouse, your job, your coworkers, your spouse, your kids, your enemies, yourpets, your medical conditions, and so on. Take a glance at Figure 2.5. It isobvious that most people’s attention and energy are directed to their outermaterial world. It begs the question: How much energy do you have left in yourinner world of thoughts and feelings to create a new reality?Consider for a moment that each of these people or things you give so muchattention to is a known in your life because you’ve experienced it. As Imentioned earlier in the chapter, you have a neurological network in your brainfor each one of those things. Since they are mapped in your brain, you perceiveand so experience them from your past. And the more you keep experiencing them,the more automatic and enriched the neural circuits for each of them becomebecause the redundancy of the various experiences keeps assembling and refiningmore and more circuits. That’s what experience does; it enriches the brain. Soyou have a neurological network about your boss, a neurological network aboutmoney, a neurological network about your partner, a neurological network aboutyour kids, a neurological network for your financial situation, a neurologicalnetwork for your house, and neurological networks about all your physical-worldpossessions because you’ve experienced all of those people or things atdifferent times and places.image [../Images/p75.jpg]Every person, object, thing, place, or situation in our familiar physicalreality has a neurological network assigned to it in our brain and an emotionalcomponent connected to it because we’ve experienced all these things. This ishow our energy becomes bonded to our past-present reality. Therefore, as youplace your attention on all these elements, your energy is flowing away from youand it leaves little energy in your inner world of thoughts and feelings tocreate something new in your life.If you look at the magnified portions of the figure where the two ovalsintersect, these represent how we use different elements in our outer world toreaffirm our emotional addiction. You may use your friends to reaffirm youraddiction to suffering, you may use your enemies to reaffirm your addiction tohatred. It begs the question, How much of your creative energy could you beusing to design a new destiny?When your attention, and therefore your energy, is divided between all theseouter-world objects, people, problems, and issues, there’s no energy left foryou to put on your inner world of thoughts and feelings. So there’s no energyleft for you to use to create something new. Why? Because how you think and howyou feel literally creates your personal reality. Therefore, if you are thinkingand feeling equal to everything that you know (that’s the known), you keepreaffirming the same life. In fact, we could say that your personality is nolonger creating your personal reality; now your personal reality is creatingyour personality. Your external environment is controlling your thoughts andfeelings. There’s a biological match between your inner world of thoughts andfeelings and your outer-world, past-present reality made of people and objectsat certain times and places. You are continuously keeping your life the samebecause you are keeping your attention (thoughts) and your energy (feelings) thesame.Finally, if how you think and how you feel broadcasts an electromagneticsignature that influences every area of your life, you are broadcasting the sameelectromagnetic energy and your life never changes. We could say that yourenergy is equal to everything in your past-present reality—and you arere-creating the past. That’s not the only limitation that occurs, though. Whenyou place all your attention and energy on the outer world and you keep reactingto the same conditions in the same way—in a state of chronic stress, whichcauses the brain to be in a constant state of arousal—your inner world becomesimbalanced and your brain begins to work inefficiently. And then you become lesseffective in creating anything at all. In other words, you become a victim ofyour life instead of the creator of your life.Living by the Hormones of StressNow let’s take a closer look at how we end up getting addicted to our negativeemotions—or more precisely, what we call the hormones of stress. The moment wereact to any condition in our outer world that tends to be threatening, whetherthe threat is real or imagined, our body releases stress hormones in order tomobilize enormous amounts of energy in response to that threat. When thisoccurs, the body moves out of balance—that’s exactly what stress is. This is anatural and healthy response, because in antiquity, that chemical cocktail ofadrenaline and cortisol and similar hormones were released when we were facingsome danger in the outer world. Maybe a predator was chasing us, for example,and we had to make the decision to fight, run, or hide.When we are in survival mode, we automatically become materialists, definingreality with our senses: by what we can see, hear, smell, feel, and taste. Wealso narrow our focus and put all our attention on matter—on our bodies existingin a particular space and time. The hormones of stress cause us to give all ourattention to our outer world because that’s where the danger lurks. Back in thedays of early humans, of course, this response was a good thing. It wasadaptive. It kept us alive. And once we had focused our attention on the causeand then the danger had passed, the levels of all those stress hormones wentback into balance.But in modern times, that’s no longer the case. After just one phone call ore-mail from our boss or a family member that elicits a strong emotional reactionsuch as anger, frustration, fear, anxiety, sadness, guilt, suffering, or shame,we turn on the primitive fight-or-flight nervous system, causing us to react asif we were are being chased by a predator. The same chemistry automaticallystays switched on because the external threat never seems to go away. The truthis that many of us spend the majority of our time in this state of heightenedarousal. It’s become chronic. It’s as though the predator is not out there inthe wild, making an occasional toothy appearance, but is instead living in thesame cave as we are—a toxic coworker whose desk is right next to ours, forexample.Such a chronic stress response is not adaptive; it’s maladaptive. When we’reliving in survival mode and those hormones of stress like adrenaline andcortisol keep pumping through our body, we stay on high alert instead ofreturning to balance. As in Anna’s experience in Chapter 1[../Text/chapter01.xhtml], when this imbalance is maintained long-term, chancesare we are headed for disease, because long-term stress down-regulates thehealthy expression of genes. In fact, our bodies become so conditioned to thisrush of chemicals that they become addicted to them. Our bodies actually cravethem.In this mode, our brains become overly alert and aroused as we try to predict,control, and force outcomes in an effort to increase our chances of survival.And the more we do this, the stronger the addiction becomes and the more webelieve we are our bodies connected to our identities and our environment,living in linear time. That’s because that’s where all of our attention is.When your brain is aroused and you are living in survival mode, and you have tokeep shifting your attention to your job, to the news, to your ex, to yourfriends, to your e-mails, to Facebook, and to Twitter, you’re activating each ofthese different neurological networks very quickly. (Review Figure 2.5.) If youkeep doing this over time, the act of habitually narrowing your focus andshifting your attention compartmentalizes your brain and it no longer works in abalanced fashion. And when that happens, you are training your brain to fire ina disordered, incoherent pattern, which causes it to work very inefficiently.Like a lightning storm in the clouds, different neural networks fire out oforder, so your brain works out of sync. The effect is similar to a group ofdrummers all banging on their skins at the same time but not together or withany rhythm. We will talk much more about the concepts of coherence andincoherence in a later chapter, but for now it’s enough to know that when yourbrain gets incoherent, you get incoherent. When your brain isn’t workingoptimally, you’re not working optimally.For each outer-world person or thing or place you’ve experienced in your lifethat is a known, you have an emotion connected to it because emotions—which areenergy in motion—are the chemical residue of experience. And if most of the timeyou’re living by those addictive stress hormones, you might use your boss toreaffirm your addiction to judgment. You might use your coworkers to reaffirmyour addiction to competition. You might use your friends to reaffirm youraddiction to suffering. You might use your enemies to reaffirm your addiction tohatred, your parents to reaffirm your addiction to guilt, your Facebook feed toreaffirm your addiction to insecurity, the news to reaffirm your addiction toanger, your ex to reaffirm your addiction to resentment, and your relationshipwith money to reaffirm your addiction to lack.This means your emotions—your energy—are comingled, even bonded, with everyperson, place, or thing you experience in your known, familiar reality. And thatmeans there’s no energy available for you to create a new job, a newrelationship, a new financial situation, a new life, or even a newly healedbody. Let me say it another way. If how you think and how you feel determinesthe frequency and information you are emitting in your energy field, which has asignificant effect on your life, and if all your attention (and so all yourenergy) is tied up in your outer world of people, objects, things, places, andtime, there is no energy left in your inner world of thoughts and feelings.Therefore, the stronger the emotion you are addicted to, the more you will placeyour attention on that person, object, place, or circumstance in your outerworld—giving away most of your creative energy and causing you to feel and thinkequal to everything you know. It becomes difficult to think or feel in any newways when you are addicted to your outer world. And it’s possible that you canbecome addicted to all the people and things in your life that are causing allyour problems in the first place. That’s how you give your power away andmismanage your energy. If you review Figure 2.5, you’ll find a few examples toillustrate how we create energetic bonds to all the elements in our outer world.Take a look at Figure 2.6. On the left side of the diagram, you see two atomsbound by an invisible field of energy. They’re sharing information. It’s energythat is bonding them together. On the right side of the diagram, you see twopeople who are sharing an experience of resentment and who are also bonded by aninvisible field of energy that keeps them connected energetically. In truth,they are sharing the same energy and so the same information.image [../Images/p79.jpg]Just like two atoms that bond together to form a molecule—which share energy andinformation—when two people share the same emotions and energy, and communicatethe same thoughts and information, they become bonded together as well. In bothcases, they are bound by an invisible field of energy that keeps them connected.If it takes energy to separate these two atoms, it is going to take energy andawareness to take our attention off the people and conditions in our life thatwe’ve given so much creative energy away to.To separate the two atoms, it takes energy. By the same means, if your attentionand energy are bound to the same people, places, and things in the outside,physical world, you can understand that it’s going to take energy and effort tobreak those bonds when you’re in meditation. This begs the question: How much ofyour creative energy is tied up in guilt, hatred, resentment, lack, or fear? Thetruth is that you could be using all that energy to re-create a new destiny.To do that, you’re going to have to get beyond all of those things in your outerworld by taking your attention off them. That’s why we use meditation as themodel to change our internal state. This allows us to break from ourassociations to every body, every one, every thing, every where, and every timelong enough to journey within. Once you overcome your emotional body and youtake your attention off everything known to you in your outer world, you callyour energy back to you, breaking the bonds with your past-present reality(which has been staying the same). You’re going to have to make the transitionfrom being somebody to being no body—which means you have to take your attentionoff your body, your pain, and your hunger. You’re going to have to go from beingsomeone to being no one (taking your attention off your identity as a partner, aparent, and an employee). You’ll have to go from keeping your attention on something to placing your attention on no thing (forgetting all about your cellphone, your e-mails, and getting a cup of coffee) and from being somewhere tobeing no where (getting beyond any thoughts about the chair you’re meditating inor where you’ll be going later today) and from being in linear time to being inno time (with no distracting memories or thoughts about the future).I’m not saying that your cell phone or your laptop or your car or your bankaccount is bad, but when you’re overly attached to those things and they’vecaptured your attention to such a degree that you can’t get beyond thinkingabout them (because of the strong emotions you associate with them), thosepossessions own you. And then you can’t create something new. The only way to dothat is to learn to call all of that fractured energy back so you can overcomethe emotions of survival that you have become addicted to and that keep all yourenergy bound to your past-present reality. Once you take your attention off allthose exterior elements, you start to weaken your energetic and emotional bondswith those things and you finally begin to free up enough available energy tocreate a new future. That’s going to require you to become aware of where you’vebeen unconsciously placing your attention, and—like separating the twoatoms—it’s also going to take some energy to consciously break those bonds.People come up to me all the time in workshops and tell me their computer harddrive crashed or someone stole their car or they lost their job and they don’thave any more money. When they tell me they have lost people or things in theirlife, you know what I always say to them? “Great! Look how much available energyyou have now to design a new destiny!” By the way, if you do this work well andmanage to call your energy back to you, it will most likely be uncomfortable atfirst, even a little chaotic. Get ready, because certain areas of your life mayfall apart. But don’t worry. That’s supposed to happen because you’re breakingthe energetic bonds between yourself and your same past reality. Anything thatis no longer in a vibrational match between you and your future is going to fallaway. Let it. Don’t try to put your old life back together because you’re goingto be way too busy with the new destiny you’re calling to yourself.Here’s a great example. A friend of mine who was vice president of a universityshowed up for a board meeting about three weeks after he started doing thismeditation work. He was the backbone of that university. The students andfaculty loved him. He walked into the board meeting and sat down—and they firedhim. So he called me and said, “Hey, I don’t know if this meditation process isworking. The board just fired me. Aren’t great things supposed to happen to mewhen I am doing the work?”“Listen,” I told him. “Don’t you hold on to those emotions of survival, becausethen you’ll be in your past. Instead, keep finding the present moment andcreating from that place.” Within two weeks he fell in love with a woman helater married. He also soon received an offer for an even better job as vicepresident of a much larger and better university, which he gratefully accepted.A year later, he called me again to tell me that the college that fired him wasnow asking him to return as president. So you never know what the universe hasin store for you as your old reality falls away and your new one begins tounfold. The only thing I can assure you of is this: The unknown has never let medown.Calling Your Energy BackIf you’re going to disconnect from the outer world, you have to learn how tochange your brain waves. So let’s talk about brain-wave frequencies for amoment. Most of the time that you are awake and conscious, you are in the betarange of brain-wave frequencies. Beta is measured in low-range, medium-range,and high-range frequencies. Low-range beta is a relaxed state when you don’tperceive any threats from the outer world but you are still aware of your bodyin space and time. This is the state you are in when you are reading, payingattention to your daughter during a friendly conversation, or listening to alecture. Mid-range beta is a slightly more aroused state, such as when you arein a group of people, introducing yourself to everyone for the first time, andyou have to remember everyone’s name. You’re more vigilant, but you’re notoverly stressed or completely out of balance. Think of mid-range beta as goodstress. High-range beta is the state you’re in when you’re jacked up on thehormones of stress. These are the brain waves you display when you exhibit anyof the survival emotions, including anger, alarm, agitation, suffering, grief,anxiety, frustration, or even depression. High-range beta can be more than threetimes higher than low-range beta and twice as high as mid-range beta.While you may spend most of your waking time in beta-frequency brain waves, youalso dip into alpha-frequency brain waves throughout your day. You display alphabrain waves when you are relaxed, calm, creative, and even intuitive—when you’reno longer thinking or analyzing and instead you’re daydreaming or imagining,like a trance state. If beta brain waves indicate when you are placing themajority of your attention on your outer world, alpha brain waves indicate whenyou are placing more of your attention on your inner world.Theta-frequency brain waves take over in that twilight stage when your mind isstill awake but your body is drifting off to sleep. This frequency is alsoassociated with deep states of meditation. Delta-frequency brain waves usuallycome during deep, restorative sleep. However, over the last four years myresearch team and I have recorded several students who can move into very deepdelta brain waves during meditation. Their bodies are deeply asleep, and theyare not dreaming, but their brain scans show that their brains are processingvery high amplitudes of energy. As a result, they report having profoundmystical experiences of oneness, feeling connected to everyone and everything inthe universe. See Figure 2.7 to compare the different brain-wave states.Gamma-frequency brain waves indicate what I call a superconscious state. Thishigh-frequency energy occurs when the brain gets aroused from an internal event(one of the most common examples is during meditation when your eyes are closedand you are going within) instead of an event that happens outside the body.We’ll talk more about gamma brain waves in later chapters.image [../Images/p83.jpg]A comparison of different brain waves.One of the biggest challenges people have when they meditate is switching out ofhigh-range (and even mid-range) beta and slipping into alpha and then thetabrain-wave frequencies. It’s absolutely vital to do so, though, because whenthey slow down their brain waves to these other frequencies, they are no longerpaying attention to the outer world and all the distractions they’re so used tothinking about when they’re under stress. And since they’re not analyzing andstrategizing, trying to prepare for the worst-case scenario in their futurebased on their fearful memories of the past, they have the opportunity to becomepresent, to exist only in the now.Wouldn’t it be wonderful during a meditation to disconnect your association toall the elements in your outer environment, to get beyond your body, your fears,and your schedule and forget about your familiar past and your predictablefuture? If you do it right, you will even lose track of time. As you overcomeyour automatic thinking, your emotions, and your habits in meditation, that isexactly what happens: You get beyond your body, your environment, and time. Youweaken the energetic bonds with your past-present reality and find yourself inthe present moment. Only in the present moment can you call your energy back toyou.This does take some effort (although it will get easier with practice) becauseyou’re living by the hormones of stress most of the time. So let’s look at whathappens when you aren’t in the present moment during meditation so you’ll knowhow to handle that when it arises. Understanding this skill is important becauseif you can’t get beyond your stresses, your problems, and your pain, you can’tcreate a new future where those things don’t exist.So let’s say you’re sitting in your meditation and you start to have some straythoughts. You’re in the habit of thinking that way because you’ve been thinkingthe same way and putting your attention on the same people and things at thesame time and place for years now. And you have been automatically embracing thesame familiar feelings on a daily basis just to reaffirm the same personalitythat’s connected to your same personal reality—repeatedly conditioning your bodyinto the past. The only difference now is that because you’re trying tomeditate, your eyes are shut.As you are sitting there with your eyes closed, you are not physically seeingyour boss. But your body wants to feel that anger because every time you see herin your waking day—50 times a day, five days a week—you are in the habit offeeling bitterness or aggression. Similarly, when you get e-mails from her(which happens at least 10 times a day), you unconsciously have the sameemotional reaction to her, so your body has grown accustomed to needing her toreaffirm your addiction to anger. It wants to feel the emotions it has becomeaddicted to, and like an addict craving a drug, the body is craving the familiarchemicals. It wants to feel that familiar anger at your boss because you didn’tget the promotion or it wants to feel judgment about your coworker who alwayswants you to cover for him. Then you start thinking about other colleagues whoannoy you and other reasons to be upset with your boss. You’re sitting theretrying to meditate, but your body is throwing the kitchen sink at you. That’sbecause it wants its chemical fix of familiar emotions that you normally feelthroughout your waking day with your eyes open.The instant you notice what’s happening—that you are putting all of yourattention on that emotion—you become aware that you’re investing your energyinto the past (because emotions are records of the past), so you stop and returnto the present moment and you begin to disinvest your attention and energy outof the past. But then in a little while, you start to feel frustrated and angryand resentful again, and you realize what you are doing. You remember that yourbody is trying to feel those emotions in order to reaffirm its addiction tothose chemicals, and you remember that those emotions drive your brain intohigh-range beta brain waves—and you stop. Every time you pause, settle your bodydown, and return to the present moment, you are telling your body that it is nolonger the mind—you are the mind.But then thoughts start drifting into your mind about the people you have to seeand the places you have to go and the things you have to do later that day. Youwonder if your boss has answered that e-mail yet, and you remember that youhaven’t returned your sister’s phone call either. And today is trash day, so youremind yourself you need to put out the trash. And all of a sudden you becomeaware that by anticipating those future scenarios, you are investing yourattention and your energy into the same known reality. So you stop, return tothe present moment, and once more disinvest your energy out of that predictable,known future and make room for the unknown in your life.Take a look at Figure 2.8. It shows that once you find yourself in that sweetspot of the generous present moment, your energy (represented by the arrows) nolonger goes away from you to the past and future the way it did back in Figure2.3. Now you are divesting your energy from that familiar past and predictablefuture. You are no longer firing and wiring the same circuits in the same way,and you are no longer regulating and signaling the same genes in the same way byfeeling the same emotions. If you keep doing this process, you are continuouslycalling all that energy back to you by breaking the energetic bonds that keepyou connected to your past-present reality. This happens because you are takingyour attention and your energy off your outer world and placing it instead onyour inner world, and you’re building your own electromagnetic field surroundingyour body. Now you have available energy that you can use to create somethingnew.image [../Images/p86.jpg]As you take your attention off your past-present reality or your predictablefuture reality, you are calling energy back to you and building your ownelectromagnetic field. Now you have available energy to heal yourself or tocreate a new experience in your life.Not surprisingly, your attention eventually begins to wander again. As youcontinue to sit in meditation, your body becomes more annoyed and impatientbecause it wants to do something. After all, you’ve programmed it every day toget up and follow the same routine. It wants to quit meditating, open its eyes,and see someone. It wants to hear something on TV or talk to someone on thephone. It prefers to taste breakfast instead of sitting there doing nothing. Itwould like to smell coffee brewing, like it does every morning. And it wouldlove to feel something like a hot shower before it starts the day.The body wants to experience physical reality with its senses in order toembrace an emotion, but your goal is to create a reality from a world beyondyour senses that’s defined not by your body as the mind but by you as the mind.So as you become aware of the program, you keep settling your body down into thepresent moment. The body tries again to return to the familiar past because itwants to engage in a predictable future, but you keep settling it back down.Each time you overcome those automatic habits, your will becomes greater thanyour program. Every time you keep settling your body back to the present moment,like training a dog to sit, you are reconditioning your body to a new mind. Eachtime you become aware of your program and you labor for the present moment, youare stating that your will is greater than your program. And if you keepreturning your attention (and therefore your energy) back to the present momentand you keep noticing when you are present and when you are not, sooner or lateryour body is going to surrender. It is this process of continuously returning tothe present moment every time you become aware that you’ve lost it that beginsto break the energetic bonds with your familiar known reality. And when you doreturn to the present moment, what you’re actually doing is getting beyond yourphysical-world identity and unfolding into the quantum field (a concept I willexplain in detail in the next chapter).The hardest part of every war is the last battle. That means that when your bodyas the mind is raging, causing you to think that you cannot go any further,wanting you to stop and return to the world of the senses, you keep persevering.You truly step into the unknown—and sooner or later you will begin to break theemotional addiction within you. When you get beyond your guilt, your suffering,your fear, your frustration, your resentment, or your unworthiness, you arefreeing your body from the chains of those habits and emotions that keep youanchored in the past—and as a result, you are liberating energy that is nowcoming back to you. As the body releases all of this stored emotional energy, itis no longer becoming the mind. You discover that right on the other side ofyour fear is courage, right on the other side of your lack is wholeness, andjust beyond your doubt is knowing. When you step into the unknown and surrenderyour anger or hatred, you discover love and compassion. It’s the same energy; ithas just been stored in the body and now it’s available for you to use to designa new destiny.So when you learn to overcome yourself—or the memory of yourself and yourlife—you break the bonds you have with every thing, every person, every place,and every time that’s keeping you connected to your past-present reality. Andwhen you finally overcome your anger or your frustration, and you liberateenergy that was trapped in the past, you call that energy back to you. As youliberate all of that creative energy that has been tied up in those survivalemotions—within you and all around you—you are building your own personal energyfield around your body.In our advanced workshops, we’ve actually measured this effect of calling theenergy back. We have experts who use very sensitive equipment called a gasdischarge visualization (GDV) machine with a specially designed sensor (called aSputnik antenna) developed by Konstantin Korotkov, Ph.D. It measures the ambientelectromagnetic field in the workshop conference spaces to see how the energychanges as the workshop progresses. On the first full day of some of ouradvanced workshops, we sometimes see the energy in the room drop. That happensbecause once we start meditating and those students have to overcome themselvesby breaking the energetic bonds with everyone and everything in their knownreality, they are calling energy back to themselves. They’re drawing energy fromthe greater field, and the field in the room can diminish as the participantsbegin to build their individual field of energy around their own bodies—and nowthey have available energy to use to design a new destiny. Of course, as ourentire group gets beyond themselves the first day, they finally build their ownlight field, and as their energy keeps expanding each day, they begin tocontribute to the energy in the room. As a result, we finally witness the energyin the room rise. To see what this sometimes looks like, find Graphics 1A and 1Bin the color insert.One way to increase your chances of a successful meditation is to give yourselfenough time so you don’t get distracted by trying to rush through theexperience. When I meditate, for example, I allow for two hours. I don’t have totake two hours every time, but I know myself well enough by now to realize thatif I have only one hour, I’m going to tell myself there’s not enough time. If Ihave two hours, on the other hand, I can relax, knowing I have plenty of time tofind the present moment. Some days I find the sweet spot of the present momentpretty quickly, while on other days I have to work for an hour at bringing mybrain and body back into the present.I am a very busy person. Some days when I have just arrived home for three daysbetween workshops or events, I wake up in the morning and immediately think ofthe three meetings I have planned that day with different staff members,mentally rehearsing what I have to talk about. Then I think about the e-mails Ihave to get done before I go to those meetings. Then I think about the flight Ihave to catch that afternoon. Then I make a mental note about the phone calls Ihave to make on the drive to the airport. You get the idea.As that happens and I am thinking about the same people I have to see, the sameplaces I have to go, the same things I have to do, all at the same time in myknown familiar reality, I realize that I’m priming my brain and body to looklike that future has already happened. I become conscious that my attention isin the known future, and I stop anticipating the known and turn back to thepresent moment. As I do that, I’m beginning to unfire and unwire those neuralconnections. Then I might get a little emotional and become impatient and alittle frustrated thinking about something that happened yesterday. And sinceemotions are a record of the past and where I place my attention is where Iplace my energy, I become aware that I’m investing my energy in the past. Thenthe hormones of stress may get my brain aroused, and my body gets a bit fired upinto high-range beta brain waves and I have to settle it back down into thepresent moment again. And as I do that I’m no longer firing and wiring the samecircuits in my brain, and I’m disinvesting my energy out of the past.And if I am aware of the same thoughts that are connected to those same familiarfeelings, when I stop myself from feeling the same way, I am no longerconditioning my body into the past and I’m no longer signaling the same genes inthe same ways. And if emotions are the end products of experiences in theenvironment, and if it’s the environment that signals the gene, then when I stopfeeling those same emotions, I am no longer selecting and instructing the samegenes in the same ways. That not only affects the health of my body, but it alsono longer primes my body to be in the same future, based on living in the past.So as I inhibit those familiar feelings, I am changing the genetic program of mybody. And since the hormones of long-term stress down-regulate the expression ofhealthy genes and create disease, every time I am able to stop when I catchmyself feeling any of those emotions that are related to stress, I am no longerconditioning my body to stay addicted to the emotions of stress.image [../Images/p90.jpg]When you are in the sweet spot of the generous present moment, your familiarpast and your predictable future no longer exist and now you are ready to createnew possibilities in your life.If I do it properly—overcoming my familiar thoughts and emotions of my knownpast and future—then energetically, neurologically, biologically, chemically,hormonally, and genetically, that predictable future (as well as the familiarpast I used to affirm it) no longer exists. If I’m no longer firing and nolonger wiring those same old neural networks (by no longer thinking about thosememories of the people or things at certain times and places), and I keepreturning to the present moment, I am calling energy back to me. Take a look atFigure 2.9 and you can see how the familiar past and the predictable future nolonger exist.Now I’m in the sweet spot of the generous present moment, and I have availableenergy to create. I’ve built my own energy field surrounding my body. Every timeI’ve labored—sometimes for hours—to get beyond myself and find that place calledthe eternal now, and I truly break through, I’ve always thought the same thing:That was so worth it."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 3 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t3]image [../Images/line.jpg]TUNING IN TO NEW POTENTIALS IN THE QUANTUM [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t3]image [../Images/line.jpg]Getting beyond our body, our environment, and time isn’t easy—but it’s worth itbecause once we disconnect from three-dimensional reality, we enter a wholeother reality called the quantum, the realm of infinite possibility. Describingthis reality is a bit challenging because it’s unlike anything we are familiarwith in the physical universe. The rules of Newtonian physics, the way we areused to thinking the world works, simply don’t apply.The quantum (or unified) field is an invisible field of energy andinformation—or you could say a field of intelligence or consciousness—thatexists beyond space and time. Nothing physical or material exists there. It’sbeyond anything you can perceive with your senses. This unified field of energyand information is what governs all the laws of nature. Scientists have beenworking to quantify this process so we can more fully understand it, and theyare discovering more and more all the time.Based on my knowledge and experience, I believe there’s a self-organizingintelligence that is energy, and it is observing all of the universes andgalaxies into order. Sometimes people will say to me that this idea seems a bitunscientific. I always answer them with the same question: What happens after anexplosion—order or disorder? Their answer is always that disorder results. ThenI ask: So why after the Big Bang, which was the biggest explosion ever, has somuch order been created? Some intelligence must be organizing its energy andmatter into form and unifying all the forces of nature to create such amasterpiece. That intelligence, that energy, is the quantum or unified field.To give you some idea of what this field is like, imagine taking away all thepeople and bodies on Earth, all the animals and plants and physical objects—bothnatural and man-made—all the continents, the oceans, and even the earth itself.Imagine you could then take away all the planets and moons and stars in oursolar system, including our sun. And then imagine taking away all the othersolar systems in our galaxy, and then all the galaxies in the universe. There’sno air, and there isn’t even any light that you can see with your eyes. There’sjust absolute blackness, the void, the zero-point field. It’s important toremember this because when you as a consciousness in the present moment unfoldinto the unified field, you will be in an infinite black space—void of anythingphysical.Now imagine that not only do you not see anything here, but because you enterinto this realm without a physical body, you also have no sight with which tosee—nor do you have the capacity to hear, feel, smell, or taste. You have nosenses here at all. The only way you can exist in the quantum is as anawareness. Or better said, the only way you can experience this realm is withyour awareness—not your senses. And since consciousness is awareness, andawareness is paying attention and noticing, once you are beyond the world of thesenses, when you pay attention to the energy of the quantum field, yourconsciousness is connecting to greater levels of frequency and information.Yet as strange as this may sound, the quantum field is not empty. It’s aninfinite field filled with frequency or energy. And all frequency carriesinformation. So think of the quantum field as being filled with infinite amountsof energy vibrating beyond the physical world of matter and beyond oursenses—invisible waves of energy available for us to use in creation. Whatexactly can we create with all this energy swimming in an infinite sea ofpotentials? That’s up to us because, in short, the quantum field is the state inwhich all possibilities exist. And as I just said, when we find ourselves in thequantum universe, we exist simply as an awareness or as a consciousness:specifically an awareness that is paying attention to or observing a field ofinfinite possibilities existing within an even greater consciousness and agreater level of energy.As you enter this endless, vast space as an awareness, there are no bodies, nopeople, no objects, no places, and no time. Instead, infinite unknownpossibilities exist as energy. So if you find yourself thinking about knowns inyour life, you are back in the three-dimensional reality of space and time. Butif you can stay in the blackness of the unknown for long enough, it will prepareyou to create unknowns in your life. In the previous chapter, when I wasinstructing you to return to the present moment, I was referring to you stoppingyourself from thinking about the predictable future or from remembering thefamiliar past and simply unfolding into this eternal vast space as anawareness—to no longer place your attention on anything or anyone material inthis three-dimensional reality, like your body, the people in your life, thethings you own, the places you go, and time itself. If you do that properly, youare nothing but awareness. That’s how you get there.Now let’s back up a bit and look at how scientists came to discover the quantumuniverse, which happened when they began studying the subatomic world. Theyfound that atoms, the building blocks of everything in the physical universe,are made up of a nucleus surrounded by a large field containing one or moreelectrons. This field is so large in comparison with the tiny electrons that itappears to be 99.999999999999 percent empty space. But as you just read, thespace isn’t actually empty; it’s made up of a vast array of energeticfrequencies that make up an invisible, interconnected field of information. Soeverything in our known universe, although it may appear to be solid, isactually 99.999999999999 percent energy or information.1[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch3_nt1] In fact, most of the universe is made up ofthis “empty” space; matter is an infinitesimally small component in relation tothe immense space of nothing physical.Researchers soon discovered that the electrons that move around in that vastfield behave in a completely unpredictable manner—they don’t appear to besubject to the same laws that govern matter in our larger universe. They’re herein one moment and then gone the next—and it’s impossible to predict where andwhen the electrons will appear. That’s because, as the researchers eventuallydiscovered, the electrons exist simultaneously in an infinite number ofpossibilities or probabilities. It is only when an observer focuses his or herattention and looks for some “thing” material that the invisible field of energyand information collapses into a particle we know as the electron. That iscalled collapsing the wave function, or a quantum event. But as soon as theobserver looks away, no longer observing the electron and taking his or her mindoff the subatomic matter, it disappears back into energy. In other words, thatparticle of physical matter (the electron) can’t exist until we observe it—giveit our attention. And the moment we’re no longer putting our attention on it, itturns back into energy (specifically an energetic frequency, which scientistscall a wave) and into possibility. In this way, mind and matter are related inthe quantum. (By the way, just as we, as a subjective consciousness, areobserving the electron into form, there’s an objective universal consciousnessthat is constantly observing all of us and our three-dimensional reality intoorder and form as well.)So what that means for you is this: If you’re viewing your life from the samelevel of mind every single day, anticipating a future based on your past, youare collapsing infinite fields of energy into the same patterns of informationcalled your life. For example, if you wake up and you think, Where’s my pain?your familiar pain soon appears because you expected it to be there.Imagine what would happen instead if you were able to take your attention offthe physical world and the environment. As you learned in the last chapter, whenyou take your attention off your body, you become no body—and you no longer haveaccess to (or any use for) the senses. When you take your attention off thepeople in your life, you become no one—and so you no longer have an identity asa parent, a partner, a sibling, a friend, or even as a member of a profession, areligious group, a political party, or a nationality. You have no race, nogender, no sexual orientation, and no age. When you take your attention offobjects and places in the physical environment, you are in no thing and nowhere. Finally, if you take your attention off linear time (which has a past anda future), you are in no time—you are in the present moment, in which allpossibilities in the quantum field exist. Because you are no longer identifyingwith or connected to the physical world, you are no longer trying to affectmatter with matter—you are beyond matter and beyond how you identity yourself asa body in space and time. In a very real sense, you are in the immense blacknessof the unified field where nothing material exists. That’s the direct effect ofcontinuously laboring to get to the present moment that I described in theprevious chapter.The moment that happens, you unfold your attention and energy into an unknownfield beyond matter where all possibilities exist—a field made up of nothing butinvisible frequencies carrying information or consciousness. And just like thequantum scientists who took their attention off the electron only to find thatit reverted to energy and possibility, if you were to take your attention offyour life or get beyond the memory of your life, your life should turn intopossibility. After all, if you focus on the known, you get the known. If youfocus on the unknown, you create a possibility. The longer you can linger inthat field of infinite possibilities as an awareness—aware that you are aware inthis endless black space—without putting your attention on your body, on things,or on people, places, and time, the longer you invest your energy into theunknown, the more you are going to create a new experience or new possibilitiesin your life. It’s the law.Brain ChangesWhen you walk through the door to the quantum field, you can’t enter as a somebody. You have to enter as a no body—as only an awareness or a consciousness, athought or a possibility, leaving behind everything else in the physical worldand living only in the present moment. And as I said in the previous chapter,this process requires that you break your chemical addiction (at leasttemporarily) to the same emotions that used to drive your thoughts, and you stopfeeling the same way so you can stop putting your attention on thethree-dimensional world of matter (the particle) and instead put your attentionon energy or possibility (the wave). Given all of that, you probably won’t besurprised to learn that such an experience creates some pretty significantchanges in your brain.First, because you are perceiving yourself as being beyond the physical world,which means there’s no outside danger to anticipate, your thinking brain—theneocortex, the seat of your conscious mind—slows down, becomes less aroused, andworks in a more holistic fashion. Earlier, we talked about how living by thehormones of stress causes our brain waves to fire in a very disordered,incoherent pattern (which in turn means our bodies can’t work efficiently)because we are trying to control and predict everything in our lives. We becomeexcessively focused, shifting our attention from one person to another thing tosome place at a certain time—activating the various neurological networksassigned to each one of these knowns.Once we slip into the present moment and become aware of this infinite field ofinformation where there is nothing physical—this eternal void—and once we are nolonger analyzing or thinking about any body, any one, any thing, any place, orany time—we are no longer activating those different compartments of neuralnetworks in our brain. And as we move our awareness from a narrow focus onmatter (objects, people, places, our bodies, and time) in our externalenvironment and instead open our focus and become aware of the vastness of thisinfinite blackness by putting our attention on nothing, on space, and on energyand information, our brain begins to change. The different compartments thatwere once subdivided now start to unify and move toward a coherent, whole-brainstate. Different neural communities reach out and form bigger communities. Theysynchronize, organize, and integrate. And what syncs in the brain begins to linkin the brain. Once your brain gets coherent, you get coherent. When it getsorderly, you get orderly, when it works well, you work well. In short, when itfunctions more holistically, you feel more whole. In other words, once you startconnecting to the unified field as an awareness (or once you become more awareof it by paying attention to it), your biology becomes more whole and unified,since the unified field is by definition a unifying energy.image [../Images/p96.jpg]When we take our attention off the material world and begin to open our focus tothe realm of the unknown and stay in the present moment, the brain works in acoherent manner. When your brain is coherent, it is working in a more holisticstate and you will feel more whole.When the brain is aroused due to the hormones of stress and we’re narrowing ourfocus and shifting attention from people, objects, things, and places in ourknown outer world, the brain fires incoherently. When your brain is out ofbalance in this way, you will be more fragmented, unfocused, and living in moreduality and separation.To more clearly see the difference between coherence and incoherence, take alook at Graphic 2 in the color insert as well as Figure 3.1. As you can see,when brain waves are coherent, they are in phase with one another; both theircrests (their high points) and their troughs (their low points) match. Becausecoherent brain waves are more orderly, they are also more powerful—you could saythey speak the same language, follow the same rhythm, dance to the same beat,and share the same frequency, so they find it easier to communicate. They’reliterally on the same wavelength. When brain waves are incoherent, on the otherhand, the electrochemical messages or signals they are sending to differentparts of the brain and body are mixed and erratic, so the body cannot thenoperate in a balanced, optimal state.The second change our brains experience when we enter the quantum is that ourbrain waves move into a slower frequency—from beta brain waves to coherent alphaand theta brain waves. That’s important because as we slow down our brain waves,our consciousness moves out of the thinking neocortex and into the midbrain (thelimbic brain) and there, it connects with the autonomic nervous system—thebody’s subconscious operating system (See Figure 3.2). This is the part of thenervous system that is in charge of digesting food, secreting hormones,regulating body temperature, controlling blood sugar, keeping our heart beating,making antibodies that fight infections, repairing damaged cells, and myriadother functions of our bodies over which most scientists believe we have noconscious control. Basically, the autonomic nervous system keeps you alive. Itsmain job is to create order and homeostasis, which balances the brain andultimately the body. The more we can linger in the present moment as no body, noone, no thing, no where, in no time, the more integrated and coherent our brainbecomes. This is when the autonomic nervous system steps in and begins to healthe body—because our consciousness merges with its consciousness.image [../Images/p98.jpg]As you slow your brain waves down and become less aware of your body, yourenvironment, and time, consciousness flows out of the neocortex and toward thelimbic brain—the seat of your autonomic nervous system (represented by the darkarrows moving toward the middle of the brain).At the same time, as these two systems intersect, the autonomic nervoussystem—whose job is to create balance—steps in and creates coherence in theneocortex, the seat of your thinking mind (represented by the lighter arrowsmoving out toward the edge of the brain).In other words, when you are in the present moment, you get out of your own way.As you become pure consciousness, pure awareness, and change your brain wavesfrom beta to alpha and even to theta, the autonomic nervous system—which knowshow to heal your body much better than your conscious mind does—steps in andfinally has an opportunity to clean house. That’s what creates brain coherence.If you look at Graphics 3A–3C in the color insert, you’ll see three differentbrain scans. Graphic 3A is a normal scan of someone in normal thinking betabrain waves. Graphic 3B was recorded while a student was performing an openfocus, showing coherent synchronized alpha brain waves. Graphic 3C represents adeeper brain-wave state of coherent synchronized theta.If in this state you are no longer reaffirming the known—your same life—andinstead you keep investing your energy into the unknown (as you would investmoney in a bank account), then you are able to create new, unknown possibilitiesin your life. Just as the material electron expands back to immaterial energy inthe quantum field once scientists stop observing it, when you no longer observeyour pain, your routine life, and your problems they will turn back intoenergy—into an infinite number of possibilities, into pure potential. Only onceyou are truly present in this potent place beyond this space and time—the placefrom where all things materially come—can you begin to create real change.At a four-day advanced workshop in 2016 in Tacoma, Washington, we conducted astudy to show how this actually works. We measured the brain waves of 117workshop participants using electroencephalograms.2[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch3_nt2] EEG measurements were taken before and afterthe workshop. We were looking to see if we could detect changes in two differentmeasures of brain function. The first measure was how long it took the subjectsto achieve a meditative state, defined by the ability to maintain an alphabrain-wave state for at least 15 seconds. We found that the participants wereable to achieve meditative states 18 percent quicker by the end of the four-dayworkshop.The second measure we looked at was the ratio between delta brain waves(associated with moving into deeper levels of the subconscious mind) andhigh-range beta brain waves (usually associated with high levels of stress).Anxious people usually have lots of high-range beta and a lower level of deltabrain-wave frequencies. We were looking to see if meditation—specifically thesuccessful practice of slipping into the quantum realm and becoming no body, noone, no thing, no where, in no time—might improve those values, and in fact itdid. Participants lowered their high-range beta brain waves (indicating theywere feeling less stress) by an average of 124 percent and increased their deltabrain waves (indicating a greater feeling of oneness during meditation) by anaverage of 149 percent. The amount of high-range beta brain waves diminishedrelative to the amount of delta waves by 62 percent—and this all happened inonly four days. Look at Figure 3.3 to see these results. You’ll notice that someof the changes we measured were greater than 100 percent, indicating that theseparticipants were able to make unusually significant improvements relativelyquickly. That’s pretty supernatural!image [../Images/p100.jpg]This chart illustrates the changes of brain wave activity in our advancedworkshop in Tacoma, WA, in January 2016.Changing Your Energy: Combining a Clear Intention with Elevated EmotionsOnce you’re in the sweet spot of the generous present moment, where allpossibilities exist in the quantum field, how do you turn one or more of thosepotentials, those immaterial possibilities, into reality in thethree-dimensional world of matter? This requires two things: a clear intentionand elevated emotion. Your clear intention is exactly what it sounds like—youhave to get clear on what it is you want to create, getting as specific aspossible, and describe it in detail. Let’s say you want to go on a greatvacation. Where is it you want to go? How do you want to get there? Who do youwant to go with, or who do you want to meet when you’re there? What sort ofaccommodations do you want to stay in? What do you want to do or see when you’rethere? What food do you want to eat? What do you want to drink? What kind ofwardrobe will you pack? What will you buy to bring home? You get the point. Makeit detailed—make it as real as you can because you are going to assign a letteras a symbol of possibility to all those conditions. As you read in the previouschapter, those thoughts, which make up your intention, are the electrical chargeyou are sending out into the unified field.Now you have to combine that intention with an elevated emotion, such as love,gratitude, inspiration, joy, excitement, awe, or wonder, to name just a fewexamples. You have to tap into the feeling you anticipate you will have when youmanifest your intent, and then feel the emotion ahead of the experience. Theelevated emotion (which carries a higher energy) is the magnetic charge you aresending out into the field. And as you have read, when you combine the electriccharge (your intention) with the magnetic charge (elevated emotion), you createan electromagnetic signature that is equal to your state of being.Another way to describe these elevated emotions is to call them heartfeltemotions. Usually when we feel emotions like those I just mentioned, we noticethat our heart begins to swell. That’s because our energy is moving to thatarea, and as a result, we feel these wonderful elevated feelings that carry anintent to give, to care for, to nurture, to trust, to create, to connect, tofeel safe, to serve, and to be thankful. Unlike the stress emotions (which wediscussed in the previous chapter) that draw from the invisible field of energyand information that surrounds the body, these heartfelt emotions contribute tothe body’s energy field. In fact, the energy that is created when the heartopens makes the heart become more orderly and coherent, just like the brain, soit produces a measurable magnetic field.3 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch3_nt3] It’sthis action that connects us to the unified field. And when we marry anintention (the electric charge) with that energy (the magnetic charge), wecreate a new electromagnetic field. Since energy is frequency and all frequencycarries information, it is that elevated energy that carries your thought orintention.Remember: Those potentials in the quantum field exist only as electromagneticfrequencies (frequencies with information) and you cannot perceive them withyour senses as matter yet. It makes sense, then, that the new electromagneticsignal you broadcast would attract those electromagnetic frequencies in thefield that are a vibrational match to it. In other words, when there’s avibrational match between your energy and any potential that already exists inthe unified field, you begin to draw that new experience to you. It will findyou as you become the vortex to your future. So in that way, you don’t have towork to bring what you want to manifest to you and you don’t have to go anywhereto get it (that’s changing matter with matter). You have to become pureconsciousness (no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time) and change yourenergy—the electromagnetic signal you are broadcasting—and then you will drawthat future experience right to you (changing energy into matter). You willliterally tune in to the energy of a new future, and as you do so, the observer(the unified field) is observing you observe a new destiny, and it then endorsesyour creation. Take a glance at Figure 3.4.image [../Images/p102.jpg]Once we’re in the present moment, there are infinite possibilities that exist inthe quantum field as electromagnetic frequencies. As you combine a clearintention with elevated emotions, you are broadcasting a whole newelectromagnetic signature into the field. When there’s a vibrational matchbetween your energy and the energy of that potential, the longer you’reconscious of that energy, the more you will draw the experience to you.Each letter represents a different potential: R is a new relationship. J is anew job. P is a problem being resolved in your life. M is a mystical experience.G is a genius mind. H is health. A is abundance. O is a new opportunity.Before we go any further, I want to back up just a bit to emphasize howimportant elevated emotions are for this equation to work. After all, when youdecide to observe a future in the quantum field that you want to manifest, ifyou’re doing it as a victim or as someone who’s suffering or feeling limited orunhappy, your energy is not going to be consistent with your intended creationand you won’t be able to call that new future to yourself. That’s the past. Youmay have a clear intention and therefore your mind may be in the future becauseyou can imagine what you want, but if you feel any of those familiar limitedemotions, your body still believes it’s in the same limited past experiences.As you learned in the previous chapter, emotion is energy in motion, andelevated emotions carry a higher frequency than survival emotions. So if youwant to create change, you have to do it from a level of energy that’s greaterthan guilt, greater than pain, greater than fear, greater than anger, greaterthan shame, and greater than unworthiness. In fact, any lower-vibrational energythat you are feeling cannot carry the thought of your future dream. It willcarry only a level of consciousness equal to those limited emotions. Therefore,if you are going to perform something that’s unlimited, you’d better feelunlimited. If you want to create freedom, you’d better feel free. And if youwant to truly heal yourself, you’d better raise your energy to wholeness. Themore elevated the emotion you feel, the greater the energy you broadcast and themore influence you will have on the material world of matter. And the greateryour energy, the shorter the amount of time it takes for your manifestation toappear in your life.In this process, you relax and allow a greater mind—the consciousness of theunified field—to organize an event that’s right for you. You essentially get outof the way. When you are surprised by an unknown experience that seems like itcame out of nowhere, that’s because you created it in no where. Somethingappeared out of nothing because you created it in no thing. And it can happen inno time if you create it in the realm beyond linear time—that’s the quantumfield, where there is no time.A French researcher named René Peoc’h, Ph.D., demonstrated the power ofintention with newly hatched baby chicks.4 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch3_nt4] Whenchicks hatch, they usually imprint on their mother, bonding with her andfollowing her around. But if the mother isn’t there when the chicks hatch,they’ll imprint on the first moving object they encounter. For example, if achick first sees a human, it will follow the human around in the same way.For his study, Peoc’h built a special type of random event generator: acomputerized robot that would turn randomly as it moved around an arena, goingright 50 percent of the time and going left 50 percent of the time. As acontrol, he first recorded the robot’s path in the arena with no chicks present.He found that over time, the robot covered most of the arena equally. Next,Peoc’h exposed newly hatched chicks to the robot. As expected, they imprinted onthe robot as if it was their mother and followed it all over the arena. Afterthe chicks had imprinted on the robot, he removed them from the arena and putthem in a cage on one side, where they could see the robot but not move towardit.image [../Images/p104.jpg]An illustration of the results of René Peoc’h’s baby chick experiment. The boxmarked A represents the movement of the random event generator when the cage isempty. The box marked B shows the movement of the random event generator whenthe chicks were placed in the cage to the right of the arena. If the intentionsof the chicks could influence the random event generator to move toward them amajority of the time, imagine what you can do in drawing your new future to you.What happened next was astonishing—the intention of the baby chicks to be nearto what they believed to be their mother (in this case, the robot) actuallyinfluenced the random movements of the robot. It no longer moved all over thearena but instead remained in the half of the arena closest to the chicks. (SeeFigure 3.5.) If the intentions of baby chicks can influence the movements of acomputerized robot, just imagine what you can do in drawing your future to you.In this place of the unified field, you’re actually becoming aware of whatalready exists and you’re bringing it to life with your attention and yourintention. Here, you can be a genius. You can be abundant. You can be healthy.You can be wealthy. You can have a mystical experience. You can create a newjob. You can resolve a problem in your life.Remember: All these possibilities exist as electromagnetic potentials in thequantum field—you cannot experience them with your senses because they don’t yetexist in this space and time. They exist only as frequency or energy carryinginformation that has to be tuned in to and observed into this space and time.And in order for you to do this properly, you are going to have to connect tothat information and energy with your energy and intention.Here’s another way to look at it: If you’re unified with the consciousness andthe energy of every body, every one, every thing, every place, and every timewithin a vast unified field of potentials, then observing a potential in thequantum is just like becoming aware of your hand in the physical world—you’realready connected to it; it already exists. Tuning in to the energy of yourfuture and intentionally observing that potential in the quantum then causesinfinite fields of energy to collapse into particles, called a quantum event,and that becomes an experience that can then manifest in your physical,three-dimensional world.Then when you get up from your meditation, even though you’re back in thethree-dimensional world of matter, because you already experienced the elevatedemotion you anticipated ahead of the experience, you have no choice but to getup feeling as if your intent has already manifested, or as if your prayer isalready answered. You feel intimately connected to your new future, knowing itwill show up in a way you can’t predict (because if you can predict it, thenit’s a known). In effect, you get up as a new self—one who feels more likeenergy than matter.But you must remain aware, because the moment you forget and start stressingabout when it’s going to happen or how it’s going to happen, you’ll return backto your old self—trying to predict the future based on the past. And then you’llstart feeling the same old familiar emotions (with the same lower energy) thatinfluence your same old thoughts, and you’ve just made the choice to staytrapped in the known. We could say that you’ll disconnect from the energy ofyour future the moment you feel the familiar energy of the emotions of yourpast.If you instead become successful at tuning in to this potential you have chosenover and over again and you get familiar with it, you will be able to tune in toit not only in meditation but also when you’re in line at the bank. You’ll beable to tune in to it when you’re sitting in traffic. You can do it when you’reshaving, when you’re cooking, and when you’re taking a walk. You can do it overand over again with your eyes open, just as you do when your eyes are closed inmeditation. Just remember, every time you tune in to the energy of your futurein the present moment, you are drawing your future to you.And if you do it often enough, and you do it correctly, you’ll change yourbiology from a past-present reality to a future-present reality. That is, youwill change your brain neurologically from being a record of the past tobecoming a map to the future. At the same time, as you teach your bodyemotionally what that future will feel like in the present moment, you’llrecondition your body with this new elevated emotion. You’ll be able to signalnew genes in new ways, and you’ll change your body to look like the future youchose with your clear intention has already happened. That means you begin tobiologically wear your future.Jace Goes QuantumWhen my oldest son, Jace, finished graduate school, he went to work for a largecompany in Santa Barbara that made sophisticated cameras for the military. Whenhe completed his contract, he moved to San Diego to work with a startup. After awhile, though, he became disillusioned with the management and decided to leavethe company and travel. He’s a big-wave surfer, so he came up with an elaborateplan to go all over Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand for seven months. Hepacked up his suitcase with the surfboards and off he went, and he had the timeof his life. After six months, he called me from New Zealand and said, “Dad,listen, I have to start thinking about what I’m going to do when I get back tothe real world. I want to create a new and better job than my previous ones, butI want to do it differently. I’ve learned a lot from taking time off.”“Okay,” I responded. “There must be a potential in the quantum field that youcan tune in to that’s related to a new job for you. Take out a piece of paperand write the letter ‘J’ on it, and draw two squiggly lines around it torepresent the electromagnetic field.” (Hang on, because you’re going to be doingsomething similar in the meditation at the end of this chapter.) Once he’d donethat, I said, “That ‘J’ is a symbol that represents a possibility—your clearintention of the job you want. But now we have to get very clear on exactly whatkind of job you want, so let’s list what’s important to you in this job. I wantyou to think about the conditions of what that letter ‘J’ for ‘new job’ means toyou. Under that ‘J,’ I want you to write the word intention and list thespecifics of what you want in your new job. You can write down anything you wantexcept when or how it is going to happen.”“I want to be able to work from anywhere in the world,” he told me, “and I wantto make the same amount of money I was making at my old job—or more. I want tohave independent contracts for six months to a year, and I have to love what Ido.”“Good—anything else?” I asked.“Yeah, I want to be my own boss and lead my own team,” he said.“Okay, now you have your clear intention,” I told him. “Every time you think ofthis letter ‘J,’ can you associate the letter with the meaning you just gaveit—all the specifics of what you want that you just listed?” He said he could dothat.Then I asked him to think about how he was going to feel when it happened. “Nextto or below your sub-intentions that you listed to get clear on your new job,” Itold him, “I want you to write, ‘Elevated Emotions—the Energy of My Future.’ Nowlet’s list them one by one. What are they?”“Empowered, in love with life, free, and grateful,” he told me, identifying theelevated emotions he would use to bring this job to him. All that was left wasjust making everything line up. Take a look at Figure 3.6 to see what Jace did.“You have plenty of time on your hands right now. You are not doing much butsurfing and relaxing on vacation,” I told him. “So it should be easy for you tocreate your future. Will you commit to doing what it takes to broadcast a newsignature into the field every day?” He agreed.Then I reviewed with him the concept of finding the present moment and gettingcentered and raising his energy so that his energy could carry his intention forhis future. “Just hold that symbol in your mind’s eye while you radiate thatenergy into the space beyond your body in space,” I instructed, “like tuning into a radio station and picking up a frequency that carries information. Thelonger your awareness lingers in this energy or the longer you are conscious ofthe energy of your future, the more likely you will be to call the experience toyou. So just tune in to the energy of your future every day. And remember,whatever you broadcast into the unified field is your experiment with destiny.When there is a vibrational match between your energy and the energy of thispotential, it will find you. So, Jace, can you stay there?”“Yeah,” he replied.image [../Images/p108.jpg]This is how my son Jace created his new job. J is a symbol that represents apotential new experience. On the left side, under Intention, he assignedspecific conditions of the type of job he would like. On the right side, underElevated Emotion, he assigned specific emotions he would feel when theexperience happened. By combining these two elements, he changed his energyevery day to draw his new job to him.“And then, once you’ve been in that new state of being for some time, I want youto think about what you’re going to do in your new job,” I continued. “Whatchoices will you make? What things will you do? What experiences await you andhow will they feel? I want you to live in that future reality in the presentmoment. Simply remember your future from that new state of being.” Just aspeople tend to obsess about the worst thing that could happen to them in theirlives every day, I was instead asking my son to obsess about some of thegreatest things that could happen when his new job found him. “Think about allthe time you will have to surf, the traveling you can continue to do, the teamof people you will work with, their strengths, and the money you can save for anew house and a new car,” I encouraged him. “Have fun with those ideas eachday.” Just like the piano players and the muscle exercisers that you read aboutin the last chapter, Jace was about to prime his brain and body to look as ifthe future he wanted had already occurred.“And since where you place your attention is where you place your energy,” Icontinued, “I want you to invest your attention and your energy into that newfuture. And just as your body follows your mind to the shower every morning—to aknown—if you keep doing this process, your body is going to follow your mind toan unknown.” Jace agreed to do the meditation every day.One month later he returned, and the moment he landed in Los Angeles, he textedme and asked, “Hey, Dad, I’m in the U.S. again. Can we talk?”Uh-oh, I thought. Here we go. So I called him, and I asked how things weregoing.“Great,” Jace said. “But I kinda ran out of money. I don’t know what I’m goingto do.”Now the father in me wanted to say, “Don’t worry, son. I’ll spot you some moneyuntil you get back on your feet,” but the teacher in me prevailed and responded,“That’s so cool, because now you’re really going to have to create. Now you’rein the unknown. Let me know how it goes.” And I hung up. I could feel hisdiscomfort, but I know my son and I knew he would get focused and do the work.Since he was really feeling the heat now, Jace had to seriously step up hisgame. He drove to Santa Barbara to see his college roommates, and a bunch ofthem went snowboarding for four days—just as they do together every year. Whenthe four-day weekend was over, he stopped back in Santa Barbara before cominghome, and he happened to walk into a surf shop. All of a sudden he saw the topsurfboard fin designer in the world, who also just happened to be there.They started talking, and before long the designer told Jace, “I’m looking foran engineer to design surfboard fins. We are going to revolutionize the industrytogether. I need him for six months to a year, and he can run his own show—dowhatever he wants. All I care about is ending up with a high-quality product.”You know how this story ends. Jace got the job, with a one-year contract that hecan renew at any time. He makes more money now than he did in his other job. Heloves his new career because of his passion for surfing. Sometimes he texts meand says, “I can’t believe they pay me to show up and do this.” He’s his ownboss, he can work from wherever he wants to, and he gets to go surfing to tryout all the fins. He’s in love with life. He didn’t have to send a résumé, hedidn’t have to make a phone call or write an e-mail, and he didn’t have to goanywhere to interview or fill out an application. The experience found him.When we become no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time, we are takingour attention off all the distractions in our outer world that keep us frombeing present with the unified field of intelligence that is within us and allaround us. We are turning inward and being present with a consciousness that isalways present with us. The moment we line up with that omnipresentconsciousness, as if we were looking directly in a mirror, it looks back at us.And it can finally reflect what we show it that we want. The longer we linger inthis place of nothing material and invest our attention and energy into it, thecloser we move to the unified field. And when we are at the altar of infinitepotentials, when we change our energy, we change our lives.As we move toward it and trust in the unknown—without returning our awareness tothe material world of the senses in three-dimensional reality—we experience moreoneness and wholeness within. That process begins to fulfill our lack, ourseparation, our duality, our disease, and our fractured personalities. Ourbiology becomes more whole as we become more whole.After all, when we are whole, there simply is no lack. Nothing can be missing.At that point, we are simply observing what already exists in the quantum fieldof all possibilities or potentials and bringing it to life with our attentionand our energy.So now I have to ask you: What experience is out there in the quantum fieldwaiting to find you?Preparing to Tune InThis meditation requires a little advance preparation. First, I want you tothink about a potential experience you want to have. Remember that just like theelectron before it collapses into matter, the experience already exists as anenergy or a frequency in the quantum field. This is the energy that you’re aboutto tune in to. Some of our students have lowered their cholesterol levels justby tuning in to a potential. They’ve lowered their cancer markers. They’ve madetumors disappear. They’ve also created great new jobs, all-expenses-paidvacations, new healthy relationships, more money, profoundly mysticalexperiences, and even winning lottery tickets. Believe me, my team and I haveseen it all. So go ahead, step into the unknown!Once you have the new experience you want to create, assign a capital letter toit and then write that letter down on a piece of paper. Think of the letter as asymbol that represents that specific possibility in your life. Actually puttingit on paper instead of only thinking about it is important because the act ofwriting it down solidifies that you want it. Then draw two squiggly circularlines around the letter to represent the electromagnetic field you need togenerate around your body to match that potential in the quantum.Now assign some meaning to that letter so you can get even clearer about yourintention. Think of some specific refinements of what you want and list at leastfour of them. (The only thing I don’t want you to consider including is anymention of a time frame.) For example, if your intention is a great job, yourlist might look like this: * Making $50,000 a year more than I’m making now * Managing my own team of awesome professionals * Traveling all over the world on a generous expense account * Having exceptional health benefits and great stock options * Making a difference in the worldNow on that same piece of paper, write down the emotions you will feel when thatimagined potential happens. You might write: * Empowered * Unlimited * Grateful * Free * In awe * In love with life * Joyful * WorthyWhatever it is for you, write it down. And if you think you won’t know how it’sgoing to feel because you haven’t experienced it yet, then try gratitude—thatworks really well. Gratitude is a powerful emotion to use for manifestingbecause normally we feel gratitude after we receive something. So the emotionalsignature of gratitude means it has already happened. When you are thankful oryou feel appreciation, you are in the ultimate state to receive. When youembrace gratitude, your body as the unconscious mind will begin to believe it isin that future reality in the present moment.These various emotions you just listed are the energy that is going to carryyour intent. This is not an intellectual process—it’s a visceral one. You haveto really feel those emotions. You have to teach your body emotionally what thatfuture is going to feel like before it happens—and you have to do that in thepresent moment.Now you’re ready for the meditation. You can purchase the Tuning In to NewPotentials CD or MP3 download from drjoedispenza.com [http://drjoedispenza.com]and follow along as I guide you, or you can choose to do the meditation on yourown.Tuning In to New Potentials MeditationStart by resting your attention in different parts of your body as well as thespace around those parts of your body. (You will learn more about doing this andwhy it’s important in the next chapter, but for now, it’s enough to know thatfocusing on the space around your body helps change your brain waves, moving youfrom an incoherent beta brainwave pattern to a coherent alpha and thetabrain-wave pattern). Become aware of the infinite, vast space way out behindyour eyes in this eternal black space, the space in the center of your head, thespace between the back of your throat and the back of your head, and then beyondyour head in space. Then move to becoming aware of the space in the center ofyour throat, the space beyond your throat and around your neck, the space in thecenter of your chest, the space around your body, the space behind your navel,and finally the space around your hips in this endless black void. With each ofthese, take your time and feel it, become aware of it, and stay present with it.Become aware of the vastness of space that the room you’re in occupies in space,and then extend your awareness to the vastness of space beyond the room inspace, and finally to the vastness of space that all of space occupies in space.Now it’s time to take your attention off your body, the environment, and timeand to become no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time, to become pureconsciousness, to unfold as an awareness into this infinite black space andendless field where all possibilities exist. If you get distracted, simplyreturn to the present moment (as we discussed in the previous chapter). Keepunfolding into this immaterial space by continuously reinvesting your attentioninto it.Think about the potential that already exists in the quantum field that you wantto tune in to by remembering your letter. Sense the energy of that futurepotential—within you and all around you—and tune in to your future. When you dothis, you will be moving into a new state of being, broadcasting a whole newelectromagnetic signature into the field. When there’s a vibrational matchbetween your energy and that potential, the new event is going to find you—youdon’t have to make anything happen. I want to be clear here. It might take morethan a few meditations for your future opportunity to unfold. It could happen ina week, a month, or even longer. The key is to keep doing it until it occurs.Once you are in a new state of being, broadcasting a new electromagneticsignature, now remember your future before it happens and begin to mentallyrehearse what that future will be like by living in that future. Make it as realas possible, calling up those elevated emotions you listed so you can teach yourbody emotionally what that future feels like.Surrender your creation to a greater mind, planting a seed in the infinite fieldof possibilities—and just let it go! Finally, bless your body with a new mind.Bless your life, bless your challenges, bless your soul, bless your past, andbless your future. Bless the divine in you, and open your heart and give thanksfor a new life before it’s made manifest.Slowly bring your awareness back to the room and when you’re ready, open youreyes. Get up from your meditation as though your future has already happened—andlet the synchronicities and new possibilities find you."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 4 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t4]image [../Images/line.jpg]BLESSING OF THE ENERGY CENTERS [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t4]image [../Images/line.jpg]We’ve been talking a lot about light and information or energy andconsciousness. Now it’s time to go a little deeper into those concepts to helpexplain how the next meditation works. As you already understand, everything inour known universe is made up of or emits either light and information or energyand consciousness—which are other ways of describing electromagnetic energy. Infact, these elements are so intimately combined that it’s impossible to separatethem. Look around you. Even if you don’t see anything other than matter—objects,things, people, or places—there’s also a sea of infinite invisible frequenciesthat are carrying encoded information. That means not only that your body ismade up of light and information, of energy and consciousness, but also that youas a conscious being with a body are made of gravitationally organized lightpacked with information that is continuously sending and receiving variousfrequencies, all carrying different signals, just like a radio or a cell phone.All frequency, of course, carries information. Think about radio waves for amoment. There are radio waves moving through the room you’re sitting in rightnow. If you turned a radio on, you could tune it to a specific wavelength orsignal, and then a little transducer in the radio would pick up that signal andturn it into sound that you could hear and understand as your favorite song, thenews, or even a commercial. Just because you can’t see the radio waves in theair doesn’t mean they aren’t there, carrying distinct information on a specificfrequency all the time. If you change the frequency a small degree and tune into another station, a different message will be carried on that wavelength.Take a look at Figure 4.1A, which shows the entire light spectrum anddemonstrates all the electromagnetic frequencies that we know of. The visiblelight spectrum—where we perceive the various array of colors present in thisworld we live in—makes up less than 1 percent of all the frequencies of lightthat exist. That means that the majority of frequencies are beyond ourperception, and therefore most of our known reality in this universe cannot beexperienced by our senses. So aside from our ability to perceive light beingabsorbed or reflected off objects and things, the truth is that we are able toperceive only a very small spectrum of reality. There’s a lot of otherinformation available to us besides what we can see with our physical eyes.Remember that when I refer to light, I am talking about all light, whichincludes the entire spectrum of electromagnetic frequencies—seen and unseen—andnot just visible light.image [../Images/p116.jpg]This figure represents the entire spectrum of electromagnetic frequencies fromthe zero-point field slowing down in frequency all the way to matter. As energyincreases (or as the frequency speeds up), the wavelengths decrease. As energydecreases (or as the frequency slows down), wavelengths increase. In the middle,labeled visible light, is the only spectrum of reality we perceive.For example, even though we don’t see x-rays, they still exist. We know thisbecause we as human beings have the ability to create x-rays, and we can alsomeasure them. In fact, an infinite number of frequencies exists within thespectrum of x-ray light. X-rays are a faster frequency than the visible light wesee and therefore have more energy (because, again, the faster a frequency is,the higher its energy). Matter by itself is the densest of frequencies becauseit’s the slowest and the most condensed form of light and information.image [../Images/p117.jpg]Here we see the relationship between frequency and wavelength. The number ofcycles in a complete wave—represented between letters a and b, b and c, and soon—is one wavelength. The space between the two vertical arrows pointing downrepresents a time interval of one second. In this case, since there are fivecomplete waves within the span of one second, we would say that the frequency isfive cycles per second, or 5 Hz.Take a look at Figure 4.1B. Move your eyes along the horizontal line runningthrough the waves’ hills and valleys, starting at the letter A and then movingto B and then to C. Each time you arrive at the next letter, you have justtraveled a full cycle, what is referred to as a wavelength. So the distancebetween letters A and B is one wavelength. The frequency of a wave refers to thenumber of wavelengths or cycles produced in one second, which is measured inhertz (Hz). Therefore, the faster the frequency of a wave, the shorter thewavelength. The converse is also true—the slower the frequency, the longer thewavelength (Figure 4.1C). For example, light in the infrared frequency band hasa slower frequency than light in the ultraviolet light frequency band, so thewavelengths for infrared light are longer, and the wavelengths for ultravioletlight are shorter. Here’s another example, this time from within the visiblelight spectrum: The color red has a slower frequency (450 cycles/second) thanthe color blue (about 650 cycles/second). Therefore, the wavelength of red islonger than the wavelength of blue.image [../Images/p118.jpg]As frequency increases, wavelengths get shorter. As frequency decreases,wavelengths get longer.Throughout history, people have made several different attempts to photographand measure fields of light. One prominent example is Kirlian photography,discovered in 1939 by Russian electrician and amateur inventor SemyonDavidovitch Kirlian. With this technique, Kirlian was able to capture images ofthe electricomagnetic field that surrounds both living and nonliving objects. Hefound that by putting a sheet of photographic film on a metal plate, placing anobject on top of the film, and applying a high-voltage current to the metalplate, an image of the electrical discharge between the object and the platewould show up on the film, appearing like a glowing silhouette of light aroundwhatever was being photographed.In one of Kirlian’s many experiments, he reportedly photographed two seeminglyidentical leaves, one from a healthy plant and one from a diseased plant. Thephotograph of the leaf from the healthy plant showed a strong light field, whilethe other showed a much weaker glow, leading Kirlian to believe that hisphotographic technique might be a means of assessing health. While scientiststoday debate the usefulness of Kirlian photography as a diagnostic tool,research on the technique continues.A more recent development along these lines comes from German biophysicistFritz-Albert Popp, Ph.D., who has spent more than three decades studyingbiophotons, tiny low-intensity light particles that are stored within andemitted by all living things. In 1996, Popp founded the International Instituteof Biophysics (IIB), a network of research laboratories from more than a dozencountries around the world that study biophotons. Popp and his fellow IIBresearchers believe that the information contained in these light particles,which are stored in DNA, communicates extremely effectively with the cells ofthe organism, thus playing a vital role in regulating the organism’s function.1[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch4_nt1] These biophotons can be detected by anextremely sensitive camera designed to measure their emissions: the stronger theemissions as well as the more intense and coherent the light field, the greatercommunication between cells and the healthier the organism.In order to sustain life and health, our cells communicate with each other byexchanging vital information transmitted on different frequencies of light. Poppdiscovered that the reverse is also true: When a cell does not emit enoughorganized and coherent electromagnetic energy, that cell becomes unhealthy; it’snot able to share information with other cells very well, and without thatexchange, it doesn’t have what it needs. So the mechanistic version of the innerworkings of the cell that we learned in high school biology is dated. Chargedmolecules attracting and repelling each other are not responsible for the waycells work. Instead, the electromagnetic energy that the cell emits and receivesis the life force that governs those molecules. That’s a vitalistic view thatsupports the truth of who we are.What all this means, in effect, is that we are quite literally beings of light,each radiating a very vital life force and expressing an actual light fieldaround our bodies—the totality of each cell expressing and contributing to avital field of light that carries a message. It would be safe to say, then, thatthe more we define reality with our senses and live our lives as materialistsfocusing primarily on the physical (and therefore the more we turn on the stressresponse), the more we may be missing out on valuable information. That’sbecause the more we keep narrowing our focus on the matter, objects, things,people, and places in our outer world, the less able we are to sense those otherfrequencies that aren’t visible to the naked eye. And if we’re unaware of them,they do not exist to us.As you have already read and, I hope, begun to experience yourself with themeditation in the previous chapter, it’s possible for you to tune in to certainfrequencies around you, just like you can tune a radio dial to 107.3. When youclose your eyes and sit still and eliminate the external environment (the staticthat normally keeps you from sensing those other frequencies), you can trainyourself to get a clear signal and receive information from it. When you do thisrepeatedly, you tune in to a new level of light and information that you can useto influence or affect matter. And when you do that, your body experiencessyntropy (enhanced order) instead of entropy (disorder, physical breakdown, andchaos). Once you can quiet down your analytical, thinking mind and more readilytune in to this more orderly information, your body automatically responds byprocessing this new stream of consciousness and energy, thereby becoming moreefficient, coherent, and healthy.Convergent and Divergent FocusAt the beginning of the meditation in the last chapter, I asked you to rest yourattention in different parts of your body as well as in the space arounddifferent parts of it. Now I want to dive deeper into why I ask you to do thatin almost all my meditations. When you practice this, you sharpen your abilityto master two different ways your brain can focus: using convergent focus anddivergent focus.Convergent focus is a single-minded or narrow focus on an object—anything havingmatter. That’s the kind of focus you’re displaying in my meditations when yourest your attention in a specific place in your body. It’s the same kind offocus you use when you pay attention to objects in your environment. Typically,when you go to pick up a glass, call or text somebody, or tie your shoe, you usenarrow focus. The majority of the time that you’re in narrow focus, you’refocusing on objects or things (matter) and people or places in the outerworld—mostly things that have three dimensions.Remember our previous discussion about living in survival mode with the hormonesof stress continually pumping through our bodies, helping us stay at the readyto fight or flee? When we’re in that state, we narrow our focus even furtherbecause paying very close attention to the external, physical world becomes veryimportant. In effect, we become materialists, defining reality with our senses.The different compartments of the brain that normally work in community thenbegin to subdivide, no longer communicating effectively with each other—and nolonger working together seamlessly in a state of coherence (orderliness). Nowthey’re in an incoherent state, sending incoherent messages down the spinal cordto various parts of the body. We’ve seen this over and over again when we dobrain scans to measure brain waves.As I’ve said before, when your brain is incoherent, you are incoherent. And whenyour brain is not working right, you are not working right. It’s as thoughinstead of playing a beautiful symphony, your brain and body are producing acacophony. And because of this unbalanced, incoherent state, you are left tryingto control or force outcomes in your life. You try to predict a future that’sbased on the past, and you do that in part by paying more attention to yourouter world of objects and things than to your inner world of thoughts andfeelings. In other words, you stay in narrow, convergent focus—obsessivelythinking about the same things over and over again. That’s what stress does. Itinfluences you to obsess about your problems so you can be prepared for thefuture worst-case scenario based on your past memories. Being prepared for theworst outcome gives you a better chance of survival because no matter whathappens, you are prepared for it.However, when you change your attention from using this narrow focus to adoptinga more open and broad focus, as you will do in this meditation, you can becomeaware of the space and so the light and energy around your body in space. Thisis called a divergent focus. You go from focusing on some thing to focusing onno thing—on the wave (energy) instead of the particle (matter). Reality is boththe particle and the wave; it’s both matter and energy. So when you practiceusing narrow focus to rest your attention in different parts of thebody—acknowledging the particle—and then you open your focus so that you sensethe space around these parts of your body in space, acknowledging the wave, yourbrain changes into a more coherent, balanced state.Entering the Subconscious MindIn the 1970s, Les Fehmi, Ph.D., director of the Princeton Biofeedback Centre inPrinceton, New Jersey, discovered how this shift in attention from narrow toopen focus changes brain waves. Fehmi, a pioneer in attention and biofeedback,was trying to find a method for teaching people how to move their brain wavesfrom beta (conscious thought) to alpha (relaxed and creative). The mosteffective way to make the shift, he discovered, was by directing people tobecome aware of space or nothingness—adopting what he called open focus.2[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch4_nt2] The Buddhist tradition has been using thismethod of meditation for thousands of years. As you open your focus and senseinformation instead of matter, your brain waves slow down from beta to alpha.This makes sense because when you are sensing and feeling, you are not thinking.As your thinking brain—the neocortex—slows down, you are able to get beyond theanalytical mind (also called the critical mind), which separates the consciousmind from the subconscious mind (see Figure 4.2). Now you’re able to move intothe seat of your body’s operating system—the autonomic nervous system, which youread about in the previous chapter—and now your brain can work in a moreholistic fashion.image [../Images/p122.jpg]One of the main purposes of meditation is to move beyond the analytical mind.What separates the conscious mind from the subconscious mind is the analyticalmind. As you slow your brain waves down, you move out of your conscious mind andthinking brain, past the analytical mind, into the operating system of thesubconscious mind, where all those automatic programs and unconscious habitsexist.As you do the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation I will teach you lateron in this chapter, you’ll place your attention in each of your body’s energycenters (also referred to as chakras—meaning wheels—in ancient East Indian Vedictexts), and then you’ll open your focus. Because where you place your attentionis where you place your energy, as you place your attention in each center andyour energy moves to it, each one of these individual centers begins to becomeactivated.It’s no mystery that if you have a sexual fantasy in your mind and brain, forexample, as energy moves into that center of your body it’s going to becomeactivated in a very specific way, and when it does, organs, tissues, chemicals,hormones, and nervous tissue are all going to respond. If you’re hungry andyou’re thinking about what you’re going to eat, it’s no coincidence that yourdigestive juices turn on, you salivate, and your body prepares for theexperience of eating dinner because energy is activating that area. If you’rethinking about telling your boss off or arguing with your daughter, you secreteadrenaline ahead of the actual confrontation. In each of these cases, thethought you’re thinking becomes the experience. I will explain this in moredetail in the next section when we talk about the individual energy centers, butfor now it’s enough to know that this happens because each center produces itsown chemical hormonal expression, which then activates the organs, tissues, andcells in each area.So imagine what would begin to happen if you were able to slow your brain wavesdown in a meditation and get into the operating system of each of these energycenters by placing your attention in the space around each center, opening yourfocus. Each of these centers would then become more orderly and more coherent,which would signal neurons to create a new level of mind and activate theorgans, tissues, and cells of that region, producing each center’s own hormonesand chemical messengers. And if you did this repeatedly, over time you wouldbegin to effect real, physical change.In the community of students who do this work, people have healed themselves ofchronic bladder infections, prostate problems, impotence, diverticulitis,Crohn’s disease, food allergies and sensitivities like celiac disease, ovariantumors, elevated liver enzymes, acid reflux, heart palpitations, arrhythmias,asthma, lung conditions, back problems, thyroid conditions, throat cancer, neckpain, chronic migraine, headaches, brain tumors—and more. We’ve seen all kindsof improvements in people from doing this particular meditation, sometimes evenafter the very first time they do it. Those dramatic healings were possiblebecause students were able to epigenetically change the expression of their DNA,switching some of their genes on and others off, changing how those genesexpress proteins in their physical bodies (as you learned in Chapter 2[../Text/chapter02.xhtml]).How Your Body’s Energy Centers WorkWe’re about to take a closer look at each of the body’s energy centers, butfirst I want to explain a bit more about how they work. Think of each of them asan individual center of information. Each has its own specific energy thatcarries a corresponding level of consciousness, its own emission of lightexpressing very specific information, or its own frequency carrying a certainmessage. Each also has its own individual glands, its own unique hormones, itsown chemistry, and its own individual plexus of neurons. Think of theseindividual clusters of neurological networks as mini-brains. And if each one ofthose centers has its own individual brain, then each also has its ownindividual mind. (Take a look at Figure 4.3, which lists the location of eachcenter as well as the anatomy and physiology that are associated with each.)image [../Images/p124.jpg]Each energy center of your body has its own biological makeup. They have theirown glands, hormones, chemicals, and individual mini-brains (a plexus ofneurons) and therefore their own mind.As you learned in the second chapter, when consciousness activates neurologictissue, it creates mind. Mind is the brain in action, so if each one of theseenergy centers has a plexus of neurons, then each has its own individual mind—orbetter said, each center has a mind of its own. What activates the mind isenergy with a directive and intention, a conscious intent. When each of thesecenters becomes activated, it in turn activates hormones, tissues, chemicals,and cellular functions—and it emits energy.For example, when your first center (the seat of your reproductive glands) isactivated with energy, its mind has a very specific agenda and intention. Whenyou as a conscious being have a thought or a fantasy—that’s consciousness, bythe way, acting on neurological tissue—the next thing you know, your body isphysiologically changing and therefore so is your energy. Your body secreteschemicals and hormones from those corresponding glands to emotionally prepareyou for intercourse. You have more energy in that center now, and it’s releasingits own specific frequency carrying an intentional message.That energy, carrying the conscious intention, is activating that reproductivecenter, and the mind in the brain is influencing the mind in the body at thelevel of its individual nerve plexus. This mind located in that specific area ofthe body, through this mini-brain, operates on the subconscious level throughthe autonomic nervous system. It’s beyond your conscious control. We could saythat the body is now following the mind as the mini-brain in that energy centeractivates the related glands, which in turn activate corresponding hormones thatsignal the appropriate chemicals to change the body’s emotional state andphysiology. And then you are emitting a very clear energy carrying a specificdirective out of that center. We have all felt that kind of energy from a verysexual person. Once the energy is moving through that neurological tissue orplexus of neurons, it creates mind at that level, so when it’s activated, thatcenter has a mind of its own.The second center also has its own mind. And when we activate its mini-brain andthus its mind, we trust our gut—and the same sequence of events happens in thiscenter as we just saw in the first energy center, but with differentcorresponding neurocircuitry, hormones, chemicals, emotions, energy, andinformation. In fact, this area has been called the second brain because of thehundreds of millions of neurons and neural connections here (more than exist ineither the spinal cord or in the peripheral nervous system). In fact, 95 percentof the feel-good hormone serotonin in your body is found not in your brain butin your bowels.3 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch4_nt3] So trusting our gut literallymeans trusting our instincts. It’s almost as if our body and this center’s braincan override our analytical, rational thinking brain and mind.How about your heart center? What happens when you lead with your heart? Likethe first two centers, this fourth center, located in the middle of the chest,has its own frequency, its own hormones, its own chemicals, its own emotions,and its own mini-brain that draws from a field of energy and information thatsurrounds it. And when you lead with your heart you tend to be more caring,kind, inspired, selfless, compassionate, giving, grateful, trusting, andpatient. When this mini-brain gets that information, it sends instructions andmessages to the organs and tissues that are located in that part of the body andyou emit loving energy from this specific center of information.Now let’s look at each of these energy centers in more detail. Some of thecenters will overlap a bit in function, but for the most part, if you know evenjust a little about the body, they are pretty self-explanatory. You can reviewFigure 4.3 again if you need to.Getting Better Acquainted with the Energy CentersThe first energy center governs the region of your sex organs, including yourperineum, your pelvic floor, the glands that are connected to your vagina orpenis, your prostate if you’re a man, your bladder, your lower bowel, and youranus. This energy center has to do with reproduction and procreation,elimination, sexuality, and sexual identity. The hormones estrogen andprogesterone in women and testosterone in men are correlated with this center.This energy center is also associated with the inferior mesenteric nerve plexus.A tremendous amount of creative energy exists in this first center. Think aboutthe amount of energy you use to make life and create a baby. When this center isin balance, your creative energy flows easily and you are also grounded in yoursexual identity.The second energy center is behind and slightly below your navel. It governs theovaries, uterus, colon, pancreas, and lower back. It has to do with consumption,digestion, elimination, and the breaking down of food into energy—includingdigestive enzymes and juices as well as the enzymes and hormones that balanceyour blood sugar levels. This center is also connected to the superiormesenteric nerve plexus.This energy center is also related to social networks and structures,relationships, support systems, family, cultures, and interpersonalrelationships. Think about it as the center for holding on or lettinggo—consuming or eliminating. When this center is in balance, you feel safe andsecure both in your environment and in the world.The third energy center is located in the pit of your gut. It governs thestomach, small intestine, spleen, liver, gall bladder, adrenal glands, andkidneys. The associated hormones include adrenaline and cortisol, the kidneyhormones, and chemicals like renin and angiotensin, erythropoietin, and all theliver enzymes, as well as the stomach enzymes like pepsin, trypsin,chymotrypsin, and hydrochloric acid. This energy center is also related to thesolar plexus, which is also called the celiac plexus.This center is associated with our will, power, self-importance, control, drive,aggression, and dominance. It is the center of competitive action and ofpersonal power, self-esteem, and directed intention. When the third center is inbalance, you use your will and your drive to overcome your environment and theconditions in your life. Unlike the second center, this center becomes naturallyactivated when you perceive that your environment is not safe or isunpredictable, so you must protect and take care of your tribe and yourself. Thethird center is also active when you want something and you need to use yourbody to get it.The fourth energy center is located in the space behind your breastbone. Itgoverns the heart, lungs, and thymus gland (the body’s main immunity gland,known as the “fountain of youth”). The hormones associated with this centerinclude growth hormone and oxytocin as well as a cascade of 1,400 differentchemicals that stimulate the immune system’s health via the thymus gland(responsible for growth, repair, and regeneration of the body). The nerve plexusthis center governs is the heart plexus.4 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch4_nt4]The first three centers are all about survival and reflect our animal nature orour humanity. But in this fourth energy center, we are moving from being selfishto being selfless. This center is associated with the emotions of love andcaring, nurturing, compassion, gratitude, thankfulness, appreciation, kindness,inspiration, selflessness, wholeness, and trust. It is where our divinityoriginates; it is the seat of the soul. When the fourth center is in balance, wecare about others and we want to work in cooperation for the greatest good ofthe community. We feel a genuine love for life. We feel whole, and we aresatisfied with who we are.The fifth energy center is located in the center of your throat. It governs thethyroid, parathyroid, the salivary glands, and tissues of the neck. The hormonesassociated with this center include the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 (thyroxine),the parathyroid chemicals that govern the body’s metabolism, and circulatingcalcium levels. The nerve plexus this center governs is the thyroid plexus.This center is associated with expressing the love you felt in the fourthcenter, as well as speaking your truth and personally empowering your realitythrough language and sound. When the fifth center is balanced, you voice yourpresent truth, which includes expressing your love. You feel so pleased withyourself and with life that you just have to share your thoughts and feelings.The sixth energy center is located in the space between the back of your throatand the back of your head (if that’s too complicated to picture, just think ofit as the center of your brain slightly toward the back of your head). Itgoverns the pineal gland, which is a sacred gland. Some people call the pinealthe third eye, but I call it the first eye. It’s associated with the door tohigher dimensions and shifting your perception so you can see beyond the veil orsee reality in a nonlinear way.When this center is opened, it’s like a radio antenna you can use to tune in tohigher frequencies beyond the five senses. This is where the alchemist in youawakens. I devote a whole chapter to the pineal gland later in the book, but fornow, know that the pineal gland secretes hormones like serotonin and melatonin(as well as some other wonderful metabolites), which are responsible for yourcircadian rhythms of feeling awake in response to visible light during the dayand sleepy in response to being in darkness at night. In fact, the pineal glandis sensitive to all electromagnetic frequencies besides visible light and canproduce corresponding chemical derivatives of melatonin that change your view ofreality. When this gland is in balance, your brain works in a clear manner. Youare lucid, more conscious of both your inner world and your outer world, seeingand perceiving more each day.The seventh energy center is located in the center of your head and includes thepituitary gland. This gland has been called the master gland because it governsand creates harmony in a downward cascade from this center of your brain to yourpineal gland, your thyroid gland, your thymus gland, your adrenal glands, yourpancreatic gland, and all the way to your sexual glands. This is the center ofthe body where you experience your greatest expression of divinity. This iswhere your divinity, your highest level of consciousness, originates. When thisgland is in balance, you are in harmony with all things.The eighth energy center is located about 16 inches (40 centimeters) above thehead, so it is the only energy center that is not associated with an area of thephysical body. The Egyptians called it the Ka. It represents your connection tothe cosmos, to the universe, to the whole. When this center becomes activated,you feel worthy to receive—and that opens you up to insights, epiphanies, deepunderstandings, and creative downloads of frequency and information that comeinto your physical body and brain not from memories stored in your nervoussystem but from the cosmos, the universe, the unified field, or whatever youwant to call that power that is greater than our individual selves. We accessthe data and memory of the quantum field through this center.Evolving Our EnergyNow that I have described each of these energy centers in detail, let’s take amore dynamic look at how they can work. Certainly, our bodies are designed touse energy in each of the centers as I have outlined. But what happens when wedo more with our energy than just survive? What happens when instead ofreleasing all our energy outward (to procreate, to digest food, to run fromdanger, and so on), we begin to consistently evolve some of that energy upwardfrom one center to the next, increasing its frequency as it ascends?Here’s what that would look like: We start out by channeling our creative energyfrom the first center. When we feel safe and secure enough to create, thatcreative energy evolves, ascending and flowing into the second center. When wehave to master some limitation or overcome some condition in our environment, weare able to put the creative energy to good use, and then it will flow to thethird center—the seat of our will and power.When we successfully transcend the adversity in our life, which has challengedus to grow and overcome, we have the opportunity to feel more whole, more free,and more satisfied and we’re then able to feel genuine love for self and othersas the energy flows through and activates the fourth center. When that happens,we then want to express our present truth—what we’ve learned or the love orwholeness we feel—and that allows the energy to then move through and turn onour fifth center. After this, when the evolution of energy activates the sixthcenter, dormant areas of the brain open so that the veil of illusion is liftedand we perceive a broader spectrum of reality than we ever saw before. We thenbegin to feel enlightened, the body moves more into harmony and balance, and ourexternal environment (including the natural world surrounding us) also movesinto more harmony and balance as the energy ascends in activating the seventhcenter. Once we feel that enlightened energy, we begin to truly feel worthy andthe energy can finally rise to activate the eighth center, where we receive thefruits of our efforts—visions, dreams, insights, manifestations, and knowingnessthat come not from anywhere within our minds and bodies as memories but from agreater power in and around us. This continuous flow of evolving energy from ourfirst center to our eighth center is illustrated in Figure 4.4A.image [../Images/p130.jpg]As we evolve our creative energy, it can be channeled from the first center allthe way up to the brain and beyond. Each energy center has its own individualfrequency that carries its own individual intent.That’s the kind of personal evolution that happens when the energy flowsconsistently—the ideal. What all too often happens, however, is that the eventsof our lives and the way we react to them cause our energy to get stuck so thatit doesn’t flow in this magnificent pattern I just outlined. The places in yourbody where the energy gets stuck are the energy centers associated with theissues you’re dealing with. Figure 4.4B depicts what happens when the energygets stuck and can’t flow to the higher centers.image [../Images/p131.jpg]When energy becomes stuck in our body, it cannot flow to the higher centers.Since emotions are energy, these emotions get stuck in different centers and wecannot evolve.If, for example, a person has been sexually abused or has been conditioned sincechildhood to think that sex is bad, their energy can stay stuck in the firstcenter, the center associated with sexuality, and they may have problemsaccessing creativity. If, on the other hand, a person can access their creativeenergy but doesn’t necessarily feel safe enough to use their creativity in theworld (instead feeling victimized by their social and interpersonalrelationships), or if they have been traumatized or betrayed by another person,they might hold on to that energy in their second center. Such a person would belikely to feel excessive amounts of guilt, shame, suffering, low self-esteem, orfear. Now, if a person can get their energy flowing up to the third center butthey have ego issues and they feel self-important, self-absorbed, controlling,domineering, angry, overly competitive, and bitter, then their energy gets stuckin their third center and they may have control issues or motivation issues. Ifa person cannot open their heart and feel love and trust or if they are afraidto express love or how they truthfully feel, energy can also become frozen inthe fourth and fifth centers, respectively.While energy can get stuck in any of the energy centers, these first threecenters are where it tends to get stuck most often. And when it’s stuck, itcan’t evolve and flow in the seamless current described earlier, which switcheson the higher energy centers where we’re in love with life and want to giveback. Getting that circuit flowing the way it was designed to do is the wholepoint of doing the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation—we bless each ofthese centers so we can get stuck energy flowing again.Drawing from Our Energy FieldAs we discussed earlier, our bodies are surrounded by invisible fields ofelectromagnetic energy that are always carrying a conscious intention ordirective. When we activate each of the body’s seven energy centers, we couldsay that we are expressing energy out of these centers. Simply put, when we asconscious beings activate a specific energy in each individual center, westimulate the associated neurological plexuses to produce a level of mind thatthen activates the proper glands, tissues, hormones, and chemicals in eachcenter. Once each unique center is turned on, the body emits energy carryingspecific information or intention from it.However, if we keep living in survival and we are overly sexual, over-consuming,or overstressed by living our lives from the first three centers, we keepdrawing from this invisible field of energy carrying information that surroundsthe body, and we are consistently turning it into chemistry. The repetition ofthis process over time causes the field around the body to shrink. (See Figure4.5.) As a result, we diminish our light and there is no energy that carries aconscious intention moving through these centers to create the correlated mindin each. Essentially, we’ve tapped our own energy field as a resource. Thatlimited level of mind with its limited amount of energy in each center will senda limited signal to the surrounding cells, tissues, organs, and systems of thebody. The result can produce a weakened signal and a lower frequency of energycarrying vital information to the body. Therefore, the lowering frequency of thesignals creates disease. We could say that from an energetic level, all diseaseis a lowering of frequency and an incoherent message.image [../Images/p133.jpg]The first three centers are energy consumers. When we overutilize these firstthree centers, we constantly draw from the invisible field of energy and turn itinto chemistry. The field around our body begins to shrink.Remember how I said that the lower three energy centers of the body areconcerned with survival, so they represent our selfish nature? They’re aboutusing power, aggression, force, or competition so we can survive the conditionsin our environment long enough to consume food to nourish ourselves and thenprocreate and keep the species going (as opposed to the upper five centers,which represent our selfless nature and are concerned with more altruisticthoughts and emotions). Nature has made these lower three centers verypleasurable so that we keep engaging the actions related to them and what theyrepresent. Having sex (first center) and eating (second center) are quiteenjoyable, as is connecting and communicating with others (also the secondcenter). Personal power (third center) can be intoxicating, including thesuccess of overcoming obstacles, getting what we want, competing against othersand winning, surviving in a particular environment, and pushing ourselves tomove our bodies around.You can see, then, why some people may tend to overutilize one or more of theirfirst three centers, and in so doing, consume more of the field of vital energyand information surrounding the body. For example, an overly sexual person drawsextra energy from the field of energy surrounding their first center. A persontrapped in shame or guilt who feels victimized, holds on to the emotions of thepast, and constantly suffers is consuming excess energy from the energy fieldsurrounding their second center and so holds on to energy in that center. Anoverly controlling or stressed person pulls additional energy from the fieldsurrounding their third center. When our consciousness is not evolving, neitheris our energy.The Subatomic LevelAll of this starts at the subatomic or quantum level—so let’s discuss how thathappens. Take a look at Figure 4.6. If you take two atoms each with its ownnucleus and you put them together to form a molecule, the overlapping of the twocircles where they bond is where they’re sharing light and information. Andbecause they’re sharing information, they’re sharing a similar energy that has aparticular frequency. What’s holding those two atoms together as a molecule isan invisible field of energy. Once these atoms join to form a molecule andexchange information, they will have different physical properties andcharacteristics, such as a different density, a different boiling point, and adifferent atomic weight—to name a few—than when they were sitting side by side,separated. It’s important to note that what is giving the molecule its specificproperties as well as holding it into form and structure—into matter—is theinvisible field of energy that is surrounding matter. Molecules could not bondwithout sharing information and energy.image [../Images/p135.jpg]As atoms bond together and share energy and information, they form molecules.The molecule has an invisible field of light surrounding it made up of theenergy and information that give it the physical properties to hold it together.As more atoms join that molecule, it becomes more complex and forms a chemical,also with an invisible field of light surrounding it that is the energy andinformation giving it the physical properties to hold it together.As more atoms join the chemical, it becomes more complex and can form a cell.The cell is surrounded by its own specific invisible field of energy andinformation, giving it instructions to function. A group of cells that jointogether, in turn, become a tissue, with a field of energy and information thatallows the cells to function in harmony. The tissues join together to become anorgan, with a field of energy and information that allows the organ to functionin a healthy manner.The organs join together to become a system, again with a specific invisiblefield of light surrounding it, providing the physical properties for it tofunction as a whole. Finally, the systems join together to form a body. Thebody’s surrounding field of light holds the energy and information providing itwith the physical properties to hold it together and give it instructions forlife.If you add another atom, you form yet another different molecule that again hasdifferent physical properties and characteristics and a different atomicstructure. And if you keep adding more and more atoms, you form a chemical, andthere’s an invisible field of energy around that chemical that’s holding ittogether in physical form, giving life to that chemical. Those atomic forces arereal and measurable.If you take enough chemicals and you put them together, you’re going toultimately form a cell, and the cell also has an invisible field of energysurrounding it and giving life to the cell. The cell is actually feeding offdifferent frequencies of light. It’s not molecules and positive or negativecharges that are instructing the cell to do what it does. According to the newfield of biology called quantum information biology, it’s the biophotons wediscussed earlier and their patterns of light and frequency that the cell emitsand receives that give the instructions. The healthier the cell, the morecoherent the biophotons it emits. If you remember from what you’ve learned sofar, coherence is an orderly expression of frequency. The exchange ofinformation (via electromagnetic frequencies of light) between the cell and thisfield of energy surrounding it happens faster than the speed of light, whichmeans it happens on the quantum level.5 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch4_nt5]To continue, if you put a group of cells together, you form a tissue, and thattissue has an invisible field of unifying coherent frequency and energy thatcauses all of those individual cells to work together in harmony, functioning asa community. If you take that tissue and further develop it into a morespecialized function, you form an organ, and an organ also has an invisiblefield of electromagnetic energy. That organ literally receives information fromthis invisible energy field. In fact, the memory of the organ actually exists inthe field.The way this can affect transplant patients is fascinating. Probably the mostfamous example is the story of Claire Sylvia, who wrote a book called A Changeof Heart about her experiences after receiving a heart and lung transplant in1988.6 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch4_nt6] All she knew at the time was that hernew organs came from an 18-year-old male donor who had died in a motorcycleaccident. After the transplant, the 47-year-old professional dancer andchoreographer developed cravings for chicken nuggets, French fries, beer, greenpeppers, and Snickers bars, none of which were foods she had enjoyed before. Herpersonality also changed—she became more assertive, more confident. Her teenageddaughter even teased her about developing a man’s gait. When Sylvia eventuallytracked down the family of her donor, she discovered the foods she had cravedafter the transplant were indeed the young man’s favorites. That vitalinformation was stored in the light field of the organ.The most dramatic story illustrating this involves an 8-year-old girl who, afterreceiving a heart transplant from a 10-year-old girl, began having vividnightmares about being murdered.7 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch4_nt7] The donor hadindeed been murdered, and the perpetrator had not been caught. The patient’smother took her to a psychiatrist who was convinced that the girl was dreamingabout events that had actually occurred. They contacted the police, who openedan investigation using the girl’s detailed account of the murder, includinginformation on the time and place of the crime, the weapon, the physicalcharacteristics of the criminal, and the clothing the murderer was wearing. Thekiller was identified, arrested, and convicted.So in these cases, that information in the energy field surrounding thetransplanted organ changed the expression of the energy field of the individualonce the person had a transplant—its different light and different informationmixing with the transplant patient’s preexisting field. The recipient can pickup on that information as memory in the field, and it influences their mind andtheir body. The energy, holding specific information, is influencing matter.Then when you group organs together, you form a system—such as themusculoskeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, reproductive, endocrine, lymphatic,nervous, and immune systems, to name a few. These systems function by drawinginformation from the invisible field of energy and consciousness that surroundsthem. And when you put all the systems together, you form a body that also hasan invisible field of electromagnetic energy surrounding it, and that vitalelectromagnetic field of light is who we really are.Now back to the hormones of stress. As I mentioned earlier, when you’re insurvival mode and you’re drawing too much from this invisible field of energy toturn it into chemistry in your physical body—whether you’re oversexed,overeating, overstressed, or all at once—this energetic field around your bodydiminishes. That means there’s not enough energy or light surrounding the bodyto give the proper instructions to matter for homeostasis, growth, and repair.When that occurs, these individual centers no longer receive, process, orexpress energy, and they no longer produce a healthy neurological mind to sendthe necessary signals to the associated parts of the body where these centersinnervate. Since that energy with a conscious intent moving through oractivating neurological tissue creates mind, the energy centers diminish in theexpression of the minds to regulate the cells, tissues, organs, and systems ofthe body because there’s no energy moving through them. The body begins tofunction more like a piece of matter without the proper coherent energy of lightand information. Those mini-brains become incoherent just as our brain becomesincoherent.In addition, when the brain is incoherent and compartmentalized because of thehormones of stress, that incoherent brain then sends a very incoherentmessage—like static on a radio—down the central nervous system to each of theplexuses of neurons that have to do with communicating with the body. And whenthese mini-brains receive incoherent messages, then they send an incoherentmessage through the organs, tissues, and cells in each area in the body that’srelated to each one of these centers. This in turn affects the hormonalexpression and nerve conductivity going to different organs and tissues andcells in the body, and this incoherence begins to create disease or imbalance.The result is that when these individual brains become incoherent, eachcorresponding area of the body becomes incoherent. And when they don’t workwell, we don’t work well.Increasing EnergyIn the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation, when you learn how to restyour attention in each of these centers and become aware of the space aroundthem, you create coherence in each of these little brains in the same manner asyou create coherence in the big brain between your ears. And as you acknowledgethe particle (matter) by resting your attention in your perineum (for the firstcenter), or in the space behind your belly button (for the second center), or inthe pit of your gut (for the third center), or in the center of your chest (forthe fourth center), and so on, you’re anchoring your attention in that center.And where you place your attention is where you place your energy.Then you’ll move to placing your attention in—or opening your focus to—the spacearound each of those centers—tuning in to the energy beyond that center. And asyou do this, it’s vitally important that you move into a state of elevatedemotion, such as love or gratitude or joy. As you know from previous chapters,this is important because the elevated emotion is energy, and the longer you canhold that open focus from a state of elevated emotion, the more you will build avery coherent field with a very high frequency around that center in your body.Once you build that coherent field around a center, that center has a coherentenergy with the right instructions to draw from. The atoms, molecules, andchemicals that form the cells that create the tissues that make up the organsand the systems of the body will be drawing from a new field of light andinformation and a more coherent energy carrying a more intentional message,giving new instructions to each center of the body. The body will then begin torespond to a new mind. As you surrender and move into the present moment, andyou understand that where you place your attention is where you are placing yourenergy, you can build a new field of light and information and raise thefrequency of the signal. And that intentional thought directs energy througheach center to produce a new mind in that individual brain. As each center drawsfrom a new field of frequency and information, the body moves back towardbalance or homeostasis. And in this new state, you become more energy and lessmatter, more wave and less particle. The more elevated the emotion, the moreenergy you create and the more dramatic a shift can result.If, on the other hand, you stay stuck in the survival emotions of worry, fear,anxiety, frustration, anger, distrust, and so on, you don’t have this energy,this information, and this light around your body. As the frequency, light, andenergy slow down and become more incoherent in each center, you become morematter and less energy until your body begins to become diseased. That’s thepoint of doing this meditation: to speed up the frequency so it entrains thelower disorganized frequency back into coherence and orderliness, raising thefrequency of matter or entraining matter to a new, more coherent mind.But remember, you can’t muscle this. You can’t just will it or force it tohappen. You can’t do it by trying, you can’t do it by hoping, and you can’t doit by wishing, because you can’t do it with your conscious mind. You have to getinto your subconscious mind, because that’s where the operating system is—theautonomic nervous system that functions and controls all these centers.You have to get out of your beta brain-wave pattern, because beta keeps you inyour conscious mind, separated from your subconscious or your autonomic nervoussystem that actually runs the show. The deeper you go in meditation—from betabrain waves to alpha brain waves and then even to theta brain waves (thehalf-awake, half-asleep state of deeper meditation)—the slower your frequencyand the more access you have to the operating system. So in the Blessing of theEnergy Centers meditation, your job is to slow your brain waves down and combinean elevated emotion with an intent to bless each energy center for the greatestgood—loving them into life—and then surrender and allow your autonomic nervoussystem to take over, because it already knows how to do that without any helpfrom your conscious mind. You’re not thinking, you’re not visualizing, andyou’re not analyzing. You’re doing something that may at first seem much moredifficult: You’re planting a seed of information and letting go, allowing it totake the instructions and energy and use them to create more balance and orderin your body.We have actually measured how effectively our students can use this meditationto both increase the energy in each of their energy centers and achieve balanceamong the centers. To do this, we use the gas discharge visualization devicethat you read about in a previous chapter to take measurements of participants’energy fields both before and after they do the Blessing of the Energy Centersmeditation. The GDV technology uses a specialized camera to take images of asubject’s finger while a weak (and totally painless) electrical current isapplied to the fingertip for less than a millisecond. The body responds to thecurrent by discharging an electron cloud made up of photons. While the dischargeis not visible to the naked eye, the GDV device’s camera can capture it andtranslate it into a digital computer file. Then a software program calledBio-Well uses the data to create an image like the one you see in Graphic 4 inthe color insert.Graphics 4A–4D show how balanced (or imbalanced) the subject’s energy centersare, both before and after meditation. The Bio-Well software uses the same GDVdata to estimate the frequency of each energy center and compare it to the norm.Balanced energy centers would appear in perfect alignment, while imbalancedcenters would make an off-center pattern. The size of the circle representingeach energy center shows whether its energy is less than, equal to, or greaterthan average, and by how much. The left side of each example in Graphic 4 showsthe measurements of the subject’s energy centers taken before we started ourworkshop, while the right side shows the measurements taken a few days later.Now look at Graphics 5A–5D. The left side of this figure shows the measurementof the energy field around each student’s entire body before we started theevent, while the right side shows the measurement of the field around the wholebody afterward.We have also used the GDV device to measure how this meditation (as well as anyof the other meditations in this book) enhances the energy field surrounding theentire body. As you’ll soon read in the instructions, at the beginning of themeditation I repeatedly ask you to place your attention not only on variousparts of your body, but also on the space around those parts of your body—andthen, at the end of the meditation, on the space around your entire body. As youhave learned, where you place your attention is where you place your energy, soif you are putting your focus on this space, that’s naturally where your energyis going to go. In doing this, you’re using your attention, awareness, andenergy to build and enhance the field of light and information surrounding yourbody. This in turn creates order and syntropy instead of disorder and entropy.Now you are more coherent energy and less matter—and you have your own enhancedfield of light and information that you can draw from to create.Blessing of the Energy Centers MeditationThis meditation has become one of the most popular meditations among ourstudents and has created an impressive number of supernatural results. As I didin the previous chapter, I will give you some basic instructions so that if youchoose to do the meditation on your own, you’ll know how to proceed.Begin by placing your attention in the first energy center, and then move toopening up your attention to the space around this center. Once you can sensethis space around the energy center, bless that center for the greatest good,and then connect to elevated emotions—like love, gratitude, or joy—to raise thefrequency of this center and also create a coherent field of energy.Do this for each of the seven energy centers in the body, and when you come tothe eighth center, a place about 16 inches above your head, bless this centerwith gratitude or appreciation or thankfulness, because gratitude is theultimate state of receivership. This center will then begin to open the door toprofound information from the quantum field.Now open your focus and place your attention on the electromagnetic energysurrounding your entire body, building a new field of energy. As your body drawsfrom a new field of electromagnetic energy, you become more light, more energy,and less matter—and you raise your body’s frequency.Remember: If you are going to create the unlimited, you have to feel unlimited.If you are going to heal in a magnificent way, you have to feel magnificent. Tapinto elevated emotion and sustain it throughout the meditation.Once you’ve blessed each of the energy centers, lie down for at least 15minutes. Relax, surrender, and let your autonomic nervous system take the ordersand integrate all of this information into your body."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 5 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t5]image [../Images/line.jpg]RECONDITIONING THE BODY TO A NEW MIND [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t5]image [../Images/line.jpg]In this chapter, we’re going to discuss how to do a breathing technique we usebefore we start many of our meditations. I’m going to explain it in detail herebecause understanding how this works is vital to your ability to truly changeyour energy and free your body from the past. As you’ll see, the proper use ofthe breath is one of the keys to becoming supernatural. To get all the benefitsof this technique, your knowledge of what you will be doing and why you aredoing it will serve as the foundation for the experience and so will make thehow easier for you—not to mention making the technique more effective. Once youunderstand the physiology of how this particular breath works, you will be ableto assign meaning to the activity, put more intention behind it, do it properly,and experience all of the benefits of using breath to pull the mind out of thebody and then recondition your body to a new mind.Before we start, I want to review the thinking-feeling loop we discussed inChapter 2 [../Text/chapter02.xhtml] because the concepts are central to themeditation in this chapter. As you will recall, thoughts cause biochemicalreactions in your brain that release chemical signals, and those chemicalsignals make the body feel exactly the way you were just thinking. Thosefeelings then cause you to generate more thoughts that make you feel the sameway you were just thinking. So your thoughts drive your feelings, and yourfeelings drive your thoughts, and eventually this loop hardwires your brain intothe same patterns, which conditions your body into the past. And becauseemotions are a record of past experiences, if you can’t think greater than howyou feel, this thinking-feeling loop keeps you anchored to your past and createsa constant state of being. This is how the body becomes the mind—or in time, howyour thoughts run you and your feelings own you.So once your body becomes the mind of that emotion, your body is literally inthe past. And since your body is your unconscious mind, it is so objective thatit does not know the difference between the experience in your life that createsthe emotion and the emotion you are creating by thought alone. Once you arecaught in this thinking-feeling loop, the body believes it is living in the samepast experience 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The bodybelieves it’s in the same past experience because to the body, the emotion isliterally the experience.Let’s say you’ve had a few difficult experiences in your life that have brandedyou emotionally, and you’ve never got over the fear, bitterness, frustration,and resentment those experiences engendered. So every time you have anexperience in your external environment that is similar in some way to whathappened previously, the experience triggers you and you feel the same emotionsthat you did at the time of the first event. Once you feel the same emotion youfelt 30 years ago when the event initially occurred, it’s quite possible thatyou will behave in the same way you did at that time because those emotions aredriving your conscious or unconscious thoughts and behaviors. Now those emotionshave become so familiar to you that you believe that’s who you are.By the time you are in your mid-30s, if you keep thinking, acting, and feelingthe same way without changing anything about yourself, the majority of who youare becomes a memorized set of automatic thoughts, reflexive emotionalreactions, unconscious habits and behaviors, subconscious beliefs andperceptions, and routine familiar attitudes. In fact, 95 percent of who we areas adults is so habituated through repetition that the body has been programmedto be the mind, and the body, not the conscious mind, is running the show.1[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch5_nt1] That means that only about 5 percent of who weare is conscious and the remaining 95 percent is a subconscious body-mindprogram. So in order to create something significantly different in our lives,we must find a way to pull the mind out of the body and change our state ofbeing, which is exactly what the meditation I will teach you at the end of thischapter is designed to do.How Energy Gets Stored in the BodyNow let’s look at how the thinking-feeling loop works in relation to the body’senergy centers—especially the first three, the survival centers, where it causesthe most problems. That’s because most people’s thoughts and feelings activatethose energy centers. As you’ll remember from the previous chapter, each of thebody’s energy centers has its own individual energy, information, glands,hormones, chemistry, and neurocircuitry—and its own individual mini-brain ormind (or, really, each has a mind of its own). These mini-brains becomeprogrammed in the body to operate subconsciously through the autonomic nervoussystem. In this way, each center has its own energy and corresponding level ofconsciousness, and each is associated with specific emotions corresponding tothat center.So let’s say you think a thought, such as My boss is unfair. Figure 5.1 depictshow thinking that thought turns on a neurological network in your brain. Thenyou have another thought, I’m underpaid, and you turn on a second neurologicalnetwork. Then you think, I’m overworked, and now you’re off to the races.Because mind is the brain in action, if you keep thinking more thoughts alongthe same lines and you activate enough networks of neurons firing in tandem—in aspecific sequence, pattern, and combination—you produce a level of mind, whichthen creates an internal representation or an image of yourself in your brain’sfrontal lobe. That’s where you can make your internal thoughts more real thanyour outer environment. In this case, you see yourself as an angry person. Ifyou accept, believe, and surrender to that idea, that concept, or that imagewithout any analysis, the neurotransmitters—chemical messengers that sendinformation between neurons in your brain that produce that level of mind—beginto influence neuropeptides, which are chemical messengers created by theautonomic nervous system within the limbic brain. Think of neuropeptides asmolecules of emotion. Those neuropeptides signal hormonal centers, in this caseturning on the adrenal glands in the third energy center. As the adrenal glandsrelease their hormones, you’re feeling pretty ticked off. And you broadcast aspecific energy signature through the third energy center that in effect carriesthe message, “Send me another reason to feel the way I’m already feeling—send meanother reason to feel angry.” As this center becomes activated, it produces aspecific frequency that carries a particular message.image [../Images/p146.jpg]This graphic demonstrates how we store energy in the form of emotions in ourthird center as a result of getting caught in a specific thinking and feelingloop.Your brain monitors your chemical state, and the moment you feel angry, it’sgoing to think more corresponding thoughts equal to how you feel. My boss issuch a jerk! I should quit my job. What an idiot driver! My coworker stole myidea! I’m right and everyone else is wrong. It fires and wires similar circuitsin the same way over and over again, and if you turn on enough of thosecircuits, you keep producing that same level of mind. This reaffirms youridentity with the same image in your forebrain. And then the limbic braincreates more of the same neuropeptides, which then signal the same hormones fromyour third energy center, and you start to feel even more angry andfrustrated—which then influences you to think more of the same correspondingthoughts. The cycle can go on for decades, whether what you’re thinking isjustified or not, and then the redundancy of that cycle hardwires the brain intoa certain pattern (in this case the pattern of anger) and repeatedly conditionsthe body emotionally into the past.The body becomes the mind of anger, so the anger is no longer in the mind that’sin your brain (the 5 percent of your thought that is conscious) but instead theemotion of anger becomes stored as energy in the body-mind, the 95 percent ofyour mind that is subconscious. Because it’s subconscious, you’re not aware thatyou’re doing this, but that is exactly what is happening. So all that emotion,which was originally created from thought (because all thoughts have acorresponding energy), becomes stored as energy in the body, stuck in the thirdcenter, the solar plexus.This stored energy produces a corresponding biological effect—in this case, itcould be adrenal fatigue, digestive problems, kidney issues, or a weakenedimmune system—not to mention other psychological effects like a short temper,impatience, frustration, or intolerance. Over the years, you keep producing thesame thoughts that keep signaling the same feelings and you continue hardwiringyour brain into this very finite pattern—and in the same way you keepreconditioning the body to become the mind of anger. Thus an enormous amount ofyour creative energy is stored in the body’s third energy center as anger,bitterness, frustration, intolerance, impatience, control, or hatred.What if, instead of feeling angry, you start having thoughts that make you feelvictimized or guilty? Life is too hard! I’m a bad parent. I shouldn’t have beenso rude. Did I do something wrong? If you take a look at Figure 5.2, you’ll seethat the same thing happens: Thinking those thoughts turns on a differentnetwork of neurons in your brain. If you fire and wire enough of those networks,you produce a different level of mind, and the brain creates the internal imageof yourself that reaffirms your identity (in this case, as a guilty person). Youstart thinking, God’s going to punish me. Nobody loves me. I’m worthless. Onceyou accept, believe, and surrender to these guilty thoughts without anyanalysis, the neurotransmitters activating neural networks in your braininfluence a different blend of neuropeptides this time (neuropeptides that areequal to those thoughts about feeling guilty) and then those neuropeptidessignal a different hormonal center—in this case, the second center. And overtime, as you re-create the same loop of thinking and feeling and feeling andthinking, you’re going to begin to store your energy in the body in the secondcenter. This begins to produce a biological effect: Since you feel guilt in yourgut, you may start to feel nauseated or sick, or you may experience pain in thisarea of your body—along with emotions like suffering, unhappiness, or evensadness.image [../Images/p148.jpg]This graphic demonstrates how we store energy in the form of emotions in oursecond center as a result of getting caught in a different thinking and feelingloop.If over time you keep feeling guilty, you think more guilty thoughts that fireand wire more neurons that signal more neuropeptides that cause the release ofmore hormones in the second center. As this happens, you continue to conditionthe body to become the mind of guilt and suffering, so you’re storing more andmore energy as emotion in the second center. You also continue to broadcast aspecific energetic signature carrying specific information through the secondenergy center into your body’s energy field.So now let’s say that you start having a totally different set of thoughts. Whathappens if you have sexual fantasies about someone? Now you’re turning on adifferent network of neurons in your brain and you’re producing a differentlevel of mind. And just as before, if you get enough of those networks firingand wiring, you’re going to get a different internal representation in thefrontal lobe of your brain. And once the thought or image you are payingattention to becomes more real than your outer world, in that moment the thoughtliterally becomes the experience and the end product of that experience is thecorresponding feeling.As a result, your body gets turned on. That center now is activated with aspecific energy carrying a specific message or intent, which then turns on theindividual plexus of neurons in that center to produce a specific mind, whichthen signals genes in the corresponding glands to make chemicals and hormonesequal to those thoughts. Now you’re convinced you’re the stud or vixen of theuniverse. And if you accept, believe, and surrender to that thought or image ofyourself without any analysis, then those neurotransmitters in the brain willbegin to influence a different blend of neuropeptides in the limbic brain.They’ll signal hormones in the first energy center, programming the autonomicnervous system to prepare that center to become activated. I think you’re veryfamiliar with the biological effects that happen next.Those biological reactions will cause you to keep feeling a certain way, andyou’re going to think more corresponding thoughts equal to that feeling. And nowyou’re storing energy in the first center, and you are broadcasting avibrational signature carrying a specific message from that center into theenergy field in your body. Your brain is monitoring how you’re feeling, andyou’re going to generate even more corresponding thoughts—and the cyclecontinues. This is how the body responds to the mind and ultimately becomes themind.So now you understand how your thoughts condition your body to become the mindof whatever emotion you are experiencing and how, when that happens, you’restoring more energy in the corresponding energy center for that emotion. Thecenter where the majority of that energy gets stored is the one associated withthe emotions you have been repeatedly experiencing.If you are overly lustful, overly sexed, or overly preoccupied with wanting tobe seen by others as sexually desirable, your energy is stuck in your firstcenter. If you experience an overabundance of guilt, sadness, fear, depression,shame, unworthiness, low self-esteem, suffering, and pain, your energy willbecome stuck in your second center. And if you have problems with anger,aggression, frustration, control issues, judgment, or self-importance, yourenergy is stuck in your third center. (Hopefully by now you have done theBlessing of the Energy Centers meditation and have begun to experience how theenergy in each of your centers is able to evolve from one center to the next,increasing its frequency as it moves up.)In time, the body becomes the mind of that emotion, and once that energy as anemotion is stored (or more accurately, once it becomes trapped) in one or moreof those lower energy centers, then the body is literally in the past. Thismeans you no longer have energy available to create a new destiny. When thathappens, your body becomes more matter and less energy because as you have read,the first three centers (which are based on survival emotions) shrink the vitalfield of energy surrounding your body.To be clear, I am not saying that you shouldn’t ever have sex, enjoy food, oreven feel stressed. What I am saying is that when you are out of balance, it’sbecause these first three centers are out of balance. And imagine if all threeof these survival centers become overstimulated all at once—you can easily seehow your body’s energy would diminish over time. When that happens, there’s notmuch available energy for growth, repair, healing, creation, or even justreturning to balance.By the same means, many people who feel out of balance may retreat from theirlives and limit the amount of food they eat. By digesting less food, their bodyhas more energy to balance itself. They may also abstain from sexual intercoursefor a period of time to allow the body to restore itself. During their retreat,they will also remove themselves from the constant stimulation they normallyreceive from their environment, including their friends, kids, coworkers,appointments and schedules, job, computers, homes, and cell phones. This helpsthe body keep from reacting (consciously or unconsciously) to all those familiarelements in their outer world that they associate with thoughts and emotionalmemories from the past.The breath technique I’m about to teach you gives you a way to liberate thattrapped energy that’s stored in the first three centers so it can be free toflow to the brain—from whence it came. And when you use the breath to liberatethose emotions, that energy becomes available for higher purposes. You’ll havemore energy to heal yourself, create a different life, manifest more wealth, orhave a mystical experience, to name just a few possibilities. Those emotionsthat are stored in the body as energy will be transmuted into a different typeof energy carrying a different message through the elevated emotions ofinspiration, freedom, unconditional love, and gratitude. It’s the same energy;it’s just locked up in the body. The breath is a way to pull the mind out of thebody. You will be using your body as an instrument of consciousness to ascendyour energy—turning those survival emotions into creative emotions. As you freeyour body from the chains of the past and liberate this energy, you haveavailable energy to do the uncommon—to achieve the supernatural.The Body as a MagnetThink about a magnet as you look at Figure 5.3. Magnets, of course, havepolarity. They each have a north pole and a south pole; one end has a positivecharge and the other end has a negative charge. The polarity between the ends ofa magnet is what causes the magnet to produce an electromagnetic field. Thestronger the polarity between the two poles, the larger the electromagneticfield the magnet produces. You can’t see that electromagnetic field, but itexists—and it can be measured.image [../Images/p151.jpg]A magnet has a measurable invisible electromagnetic field surrounding it. Thestronger the polarity between the north and south poles, the more current movesthrough the magnet and the bigger the electromagnetic field.The strength of a magnet’s electromagnetic field can even influence matter. Ifyou were to take tiny metal shavings and lay them on a piece of paper, putanother piece of paper over that first piece of paper, and then set a magnet ontop of that second piece of paper, those metal shavings would organizethemselves within the magnet’s electromagnetic field. The electromagnetic fieldof the magnet is powerful enough to affect material reality—even though thefrequency of this field exists beyond your senses. Figure 5.4 illustrates this.image [../Images/p152.jpg]The electromagnetic field of a magnet will organize metal shavings placed underit into the patterns of its field.The Earth is a magnet. And like any other magnet, it has a north pole and asouth pole, as well as an electromagnetic field surrounding it. While this fielditself is invisible, we’re all familiar with one amazing way to see that itexists; the Earth’s electromagnetic field deflects the sun’s photons, and duringa solar flare or a mass coronal ejection, that field deflects trillions of tonsof photons hurled toward the Earth in a pulsating, colorful phenomenon known asthe northern lights.Your body is also a magnet. Ancient cultures (especially Asian cultures) haveknown this for thousands of years. Your north pole is your mind and brain, andyour south pole is your body at the base of your spine. When you’re living bythe hormones of stress (the emotions of survival) or when you’re overutilizingthe other two survival energy centers, you are constantly drawing energy fromthis invisible field. The energy then no longer flows through the body, becausethe body, in survival mode, is pulling the energy from the field and storing itin the body—specifically in the first three energy centers. (This is whathappens when the thinking/feeling loop we talked about earlier is activated.)If this goes on long enough, the body won’t have any electrical charge runningthrough it at all, and without an electrical charge, it can’t create the fieldof electromagnetic energy that normally surrounds it. When that happens, thebody is no longer like a magnet. Now it’s like a piece of ordinary metal—amagnet that’s lost its charge. As you can see in Figure 5.5, the body thenbecomes more matter and less energy (or more particle and less wave).image [../Images/p153.jpg]When there is a flow of energy moving through the body, just as with a magnet,there is a measurable electromagnetic field surrounding the body. When we’reliving in survival and we’re drawing from the invisible field of energy aroundthe body, we diminish our body’s electromagnetic field. In addition, when energyis stuck in the first three survival centers because we are caught in a thinkingand feeling loop, then there’s less current running through the body and thereis less of an electromagnetic field.Of course, if there were a way to get this energy that’s stored in the firstthree centers moving again, the current would resume flowing and the body wouldre-create the electromagnetic field. The breath does just that—it gives us a wayto pull the mind out of the body and to move all that stored energy from thefirst three centers up the spine to the brain, restoring the electromagneticfield surrounding the body. Once that happens, we can use that energy for thingsother than survival. Let’s take a look at the way our physical bodies areconstructed so we can understand what makes that possible.image [../Images/p154.jpg]Your sacrum, your spinal column, and your skull are the bony structures thatprotect the most delicate system in your body: the central nervous system, whichcontrols and coordinates all other systems.Take a look at Figure 5.6. You have a bone at the base of your spine called yoursacrum that looks like an upside down triangle with a plateau on the top. On topof that flat surface sits the spinal column, which extends all the way up toyour skull. Inside that closed system is the central nervous system, which ismade up of the brain and the spinal cord. The spinal cord is actually anextension of your brain. The skull and the spinal column protect this mostdelicate system.The central nervous system is one of your body’s most important systems becauseit controls and coordinates all the other systems in the body. Without the aidof the central nervous system, you couldn’t digest your food, you couldn’t voidyour bladder, you couldn’t move your body, and your heart couldn’t beat. Youcouldn’t even blink your eyes without the nervous system. So you can think ofthe nervous system as the electrical wiring that runs the machine of your body.Inside this closed system is cerebrospinal fluid that’s filtered from the bloodin the brain. This fluid bathes the brain and the spinal cord, and it’sresponsible for giving the central nervous system buoyancy. It acts as a cushionto protect the brain and spinal cord from trauma, and it flows in various riversand paths that transport nutrients and chemicals to different parts of thenervous system all over the body. By its very nature, this fluid acts as aconduit to enhance electrical charges in the nervous system.Now let’s go back to your sacrum. Every time you inhale, that sacrum bone flexesback slightly, and every time you exhale it flexes forward just a little bit.This is an extremely subtle movement—too subtle for you to notice, even if youtry. But it happens. And at the same time you inhale, the sutures of your skull(the joints between the individual plates of your skull, which fit together likepieces of a puzzle and give the skull a degree of flexibility) open up justslightly, and as you exhale, they close back up.2[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch5_nt2] Again, this is extremely subtle. You can’t feelit happening.The movement of your sacrum back and forth as you slowly breathe in and out,along with the sutures of the skull opening and closing, propagates a wavewithin the fluid of this closed system, and it slowly pumps that cerebrospinalfluid up your spine all the way to the brain, passing through four chamberscalled cerebral aqueducts or ventricles. If you were to tag one molecule ofcerebrospinal fluid and follow it from the base of your spine all the way up toyour brain and then all the way back down to your sacrum, you’d see that itwould take 12 hours to make a complete circuit.3[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch5_nt3] So in essence, you flush your brain twice aday. Check out Figure 5.7 to see what that looks like.image [../Images/p156.jpg]As you inhale, your sacrum slightly flexes back and the sutures of your skullexpand. As you exhale, your sacrum slightly flexes forward and the suturesclose. It is this natural action of breathing that slowly propagates a wave tomove cerebrospinal fluid up and down the spinal cord and throughout the brain.So think about what would happen if you contracted the intrinsic muscles of yourperineum (your pelvic floor, the same muscles you use for intercourse andelimination) and you locked them down, and then while they were locked down, younext contracted the muscles of your lower abdomen, locking those muscles down,and then you did the same with the muscles of your upper abdomen. If you keptsqueezing and contracting those muscles in your first three energy centers bycontracting your core muscles, that fluid in your central nervous system wouldmove up, as illustrated in Figure 5.8. You’d be moving that cerebrospinal fluidin your central nervous system up your spine. Each time you tighten the musclesof those centers, the fluid would be forced upward.Now imagine you then placed your attention on the top of your head. Where youplace your attention is where you place your energy, so if you put yourattention at the top of your head, that would become your target for movingenergy. Now think about taking one slow, steady breath through your nose and atthe same time, squeezing and holding the muscles of your perineum, then those ofyour lower abdomen, and then those of your upper abdomen—all while followingyour breath up your spine and through your chest, your throat, and your brain,and all the way to the top of your head. Imagine that when you get to the top ofyour head, you hold your breath as you keep squeezing. You’d be pulling thatcerebrospinal fluid all the way up toward your brain.image [../Images/p157.jpg]As you contract the intrinsic muscles of your lower body and at the same timetake in a slow steady breath through your nose, while placing your attention onthe top of your head, you accelerate the movement of the cerebrospinal fluidtoward your brain and you begin to run a current through your body and up thecentral axis of the spine.That’s significant because cerebrospinal fluid is made up of proteins and saltsin solution, and the moment proteins and salts dissolve in solution, they becomecharged. If you take a charged molecule and accelerate it—as you would if youpulled that molecule up your spine—you create an inductance field. An inductancefield is an invisible field of electromagnetic energy that moves in a circularmotion in the direction the charged molecules are moving in. The more chargedmolecules you accelerate, the bigger and more powerful the inductance field.Take a look at Figure 5.9 to see what an inductance field looks like.image [../Images/p158.jpg]Cerebrospinal fluid is made of charged molecules. As you accelerate chargedmolecules in one direction up the spine, you produce an inductance field thatmoves in the direction of the charged molecules.image [../Images/p159.jpg]As the inductance field is created by the acceleration of the cerebrospinalfluid up the spine, it will draw the stored energy in the first three centersback to the brain. Once there is a current flowing from the base of the spineall the way to the brain, the body becomes like a magnet and an electromagnetictorus field is created.Think of the spinal cord as a fiber-optic cable that acts as a two-way highwaysimultaneously communicating information from the body to the brain and from thebrain to the body. Every second, important information is relayed from yourbrain to your body (such as the desire to walk across the room or to scratch anitch). At the same instant, a lot of information from the body is carried upyour spinal cord toward the brain (such as the knowledge of where your body isin space or the signal that you are hungry). Once you accelerate these chargedmolecules in one direction up the spine, the resulting inductance field willreverse the current of information flowing from the brain down through the body,and it will then draw energy from the lower three centers up the spine to thebrain. Take a look at Figure 5.10A to see how that works. Now there’s a currentrunning through the body and the central nervous system—just like a magnet—andas a result, the same kind of electromagnetic field of energy that surrounds amagnet surrounds the body, as you can see in Figure 5.10B.The field of electromagnetic energy you’ve created is a three-dimensional field,and as it moves, this energy creates a torsion field or a torus field. By theway, the shape of this electromagnetic field is a familiar pattern in theuniverse; this pattern shows up in the shape of an apple as well as in the shapeof a black hole in a distant galaxy. (See Figure 5.11.)image [../Images/p160.jpg]From apples to black holes, the shape of a torus is a recurring pattern ofcreation in nature.So now you understand that by doing this breathing technique, you’re starting tostir up all this stored energy in a very big way. And if you do this techniquecorrectly and you do it enough times, you are going to wake up a sleepingdragon.Evolving the Energy to the BrainOnce this energy becomes activated, the sympathetic nervous system (a subsystemof your autonomic nervous system that arouses the brain and body in response toa threat in your outer environment) turns on, and energy begins to move up fromthe body’s lower three energy centers to the brain. But instead of the bodybeing aroused because of some external condition, you are turning on thesympathetic nervous system by passionately engaging the breath from within. Asthe sympathetic nervous system starts to merge with the parasympathetic nervoussystem (another subset of your autonomic nervous system that relaxes your brainand body, such as after a big meal), it is as if traveling energy from the lowercenters is ejaculated into the brain. When this energy reaches the brain stem, agate called the thalamic gate opens up and all that energy is permitted to enterthe brain.Once this energy that was initially stored in the body enters the brain, thebrain produces gamma brain-wave patterns. (We’ve recorded many studentsproducing gamma brain waves during this breathing technique.) Gamma brainwaves—which I call superconsciousness—are notable not only because they producethe highest amounts of energy of all the brain waves, but also because thatenergy comes from within the body instead of being released in reaction to astimulus in the environment, the outer world.In contrast, the brain produces high-range beta brain waves when the bodyreleases stress hormones, allowing you to be super alert to danger in yourenvironment. In beta, the outer world seems more real than your inner world.While gamma waves create a similar type of arousal in the brain—which thencauses a heightened sense of awareness, consciousness, attention, and energyrelated to more creative, transcendental, or mystical experiences—the differenceis that in gamma, whatever is happening in your inner world becomes much morereal to you than many experiences you’ve had in your outer world. Take a look atFigure 5.12 and review how similar beta and gamma brain waves are.image [../Images/p162.jpg]Through the release of the energy stored in the body’s first three energycenters, the brain becomes aroused and moves into gamma brain waves. When thisoccurs, the brain may go into high-beta brain waves on the way to the gammarange. High-beta brain waves are typically produced by the arousal of the brainthrough stimulation from our outer environment, which causes us to put ourattention on the cause.Gamma brain waves are typically created by stimulation from our innerenvironment, which causes us to pay attention to whatever is going on in theinner world of our mind. This comparison shows how similar high-beta and gammabrain-wave patterns are, though gamma frequencies are faster.Many of our students who do this breath technique produce significant high-betabrain waves on their way to the gamma range (the highest-frequency brainwaves)—or they may simply stay in these very high-level beta states. We’refinding that being in the highest levels of beta can also signal that the personis paying more attention to their inner world than to their outer world. Inaddition to seeing more energy in the brain after this breathing technique, wehave also repeatedly observed more significant amounts of brain coherence.Take a look at Graphics 6A and 6B in the color insert. You can see two studentswho have done the breath successfully. They have very high-frequency beta brainwaves that transition to gamma brain waves. Notice the high amplitudes of theirbrain waves in gamma. The higher the amplitudes, the higher the energy in theirbrains. The students demonstrate 160 and 260 standard deviations above typicalgamma brain waves. To give you a reference, 3 standard deviations above normalis usually considered high. In Graphic 6A(4) you can also witness much morebrain coherence after the breath. The red patterns in the brain show extremelyhigh amounts of brain coherence in every measured brain-wave state.image [../Images/p163.jpg]The prana tube is a tube of light or energy that represents the movement of lifeforce up and down the spinal cord. The more energy moving along the spine, thestronger the field of the prana tube. The less energy moving along the spine,the weaker the prana and thus, the less life force delivered in the body.As you do this powerful breathing technique, you are drawing the energy that’sbeen stored in those lower three centers—the energy you use for orgasm and tomake a baby, to digest a meal, to run from a predator—and instead of releasingit out into chemistry, you’re going to draw it up your spine like you would drawfluid up a straw, and release it into your brain.In fact, there’s a tube of energy or light called the prana tube running alongyour spinal column (see Figure 5.13). Prana is the Sanskrit word for “lifeforce.” Yogis have known about this tube—which is not a physical structure butan energetic one—for thousands of years. This tube is considered etheric becauseof the electrical information in the spine that constantly moves through it. Themore energy moves in the physical spinal cord, the more energy is created aslight in this tube. And the more energy created in this tube, the more energymoves in the spine and the greater the expression of life. Sometimes when Iteach this meditation, people will say to me, “I don’t really feel my pranatube.” Well, you don’t really feel your left ear either until you put yourattention on it, right? So when I ask you to contract your muscles and pull thatenergy up, you’ll be pulling it up through the spine and creating a morepowerful prana tube along your spinal cord.It’s important to add here that this is not a passive breath—it’s an extremelyactive, passionate process. Moving this stored energy—energy that has beenstored for years and years, maybe even decades—takes an act of intention andwill. To evolve your limited survival emotions, as an alchemist turns basemetals like lead into gold, you are taking self-limiting emotions like anger,frustration, guilt, suffering, grief, and fear and turning them into elevatedemotions, such as love, gratitude, and joy. Other elevated emotions to considertapping into include inspiration, excitement, enthusiasm, fascination, awe,wonder, appreciation, kindness, abundance, compassion, empowerment, nobility,honor, invincibility, uncompromising will, strength, and freedom—not to mentiondivinity itself, being moved by the spirit, trusting in the unknown or in themystic or the healer within you.Remember, evolving this energy takes a level of intensity that is greater thanthe body as the mind, greater than your addiction to any survival emotion. Youmust be inspired to become more energy than matter, using your body as aninstrument of consciousness to ascend your energy. So don’t let your body beyour mind. Remember that you are liberating your stuck energy, turning guilt orsuffering or anger or aggression into pure energy, and as the body liberatesthat energy, you’re freeing yourself and you will feel overjoyed, in love withlife, and inspired to be alive.As you pull this energy up the spine in this meditation, you’ll follow yourbreath all the way to the top of your head. When it gets there, I want you tohold your breath while you keep squeezing those muscles in your perineum andyour abdomen. When you do that, you increase the pressure inside your spinalcord and spinal column. That pressure, called intrathecal pressure, is inside aclosed system. It’s the same pressure you exert when you take a breath and liftsomething heavy—you’re pushing against your insides. But in this breath you’llbe very specifically directing all that pressure, all that energy, and all thatspinal fluid up your spine and into your brain.image [../Images/p165.jpg]As the thalamic gate opens up, a lot of the creative energy that was stored inthe body passes through the reticular activating system to each thalamus and thepineal gland. Then that energy is relayed to the neocortex, producing gammabrain waves.When that pressurized fluid reaches the back of your brain stem, all of a suddenthe lower-brain centers like the brain stem, cerebellum, and limbic brain openup to this energy through a cluster of nuclei called the reticular formation.That energy then passes through the thalamic gate up to the thalamus (the partof the brain that relays signals from the sensory receptors) located in themidbrain, which serves as a junction box. Next, all of that stored energy movesdirectly into your higher brain center, the neocortex. That’s when gamma wavesbegin to occur. When the energy reaches the thalamus, it is also relayed to thepineal gland, and something amazing happens. That gland releases some verypowerful elixirs, one of which anesthetizes the analytical mind and thinkingbrain.See Figure 5.14, which shows the thalamus, the reticular formation, the thalamicgate, and the moment of energy hitting the higher brain centers.We’ll talk more about the pineal gland in a later chapter, but for right now,know that when that happens, it’s like an orgasm in your head. This is a verypowerful energy that has been called the movement of the kundalini. I personallydon’t like to use that word because it may conjure up opinions or beliefs from alimited understanding of this energy that may discourage some people from doingthe breath, but I do want you to understand that this is the energy you areevoking with this breath.If you look at Graphic 6B(4) in the color insert, you can see the areasurrounding the pineal gland is quite active in the student producing gammabrain waves. Look at the blue arrows. The red area suggests the activation ofenergy in the pineal gland as well as a region of the limbic brain associatedwith strong emotions and formation of new memories. Graphic 6B(5) is athree-dimensional picture of the same student’s brain. Once again, the pinealarea shows a significant amount of energy coming from inside the brain.Embracing Elevated EmotionsYou’ve just read how the breathing exercise in this chapter pulls the mind outof the body as it liberates stored energy from the first three energycenters—the centers of survival. Once you do that, it’s time to recondition thebody to a new mind, the second part of the meditation, which involves attainingelevated emotional states.I want to clarify here why embracing elevated emotions is so powerful. As you’velearned from our discussion about genes in the second chapter, we now know thatit’s the environment that signals the gene, not the other way around. If anemotion is the end product of an experience in the environment, it is theemotion that turns gene expression on or off.When you embrace these elevated emotions in this meditation, what you areactually doing is signaling your genes ahead of the environment. The bodydoesn’t know the difference between an emotion created by an experience you arehaving in the outside environment and an experience you are creating internallyby embracing this new, elevated emotion. So when you embrace that elevatedemotion and think thoughts that are greater than the self-limiting ones thatkept you stuck in the past, your body begins to prepare chemically for thefuture (because it thinks that future is happening now). In other words, if youdo the meditation correctly enough times, the body responds as though thehealing or any condition you are manifesting in your environment has alreadytaken place.These elevated emotions have a higher (and faster) frequency than more baseemotions, like guilt, fear, jealousy, and anger. And since all frequency carriesinformation, when we change the frequency, we change our energy. That new energycan then carry new information—a new consciousness or set of intentions orthoughts. The more elevated the emotion, the faster the frequency and the moreyou feel like energy instead of matter—and the more energy becomes available tocreate a more coherent energy field, shifting further away from disease and moretoward health (or for that matter, toward signaling any gene). When youremotions are self-limiting, on the other hand, they have a lower frequency, andyou feel more like matter instead of energy—and then it takes more time tocreate change in your life.Here’s an example: If at some point in your past you were shocked, betrayed, ortraumatized by an event with a high emotional charge that has left you feelingpain or sadness or fear, chances are that experience has been branded into yourbiology in numerous ways. It’s also possible that the genes that were activatedby this experience might keep your body from healing. So in order for you tochange your body into a new genetic expression, the inner emotion you create hasto be greater than the emotion from that past outer experience. The energy ofyour empowerment or the amplitude of your inspiration must be greater than yourpain or sadness. Now you are changing the inner environment of the body, whichis the outer environment of the cell; the genes for health can be up-regulatedwhile the genes for disease can be down-regulated. The more profound theemotion, the louder you’re knocking on your genetic door and the more you’regoing to signal those genes to change the structure and function of your body.That’s how it works.We can actually prove this because in one of our 2017 advanced workshops inTampa, we measured gene expression in a randomized selection of 30 workshopparticipants.4 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch5_nt4] The results showed that ourstudents were able to significantly change the expression of eight genes overthe course of the four-day workshop by changing their internal states. There isonly one possibility in 20 that the results were due to chance—that’s thethreshold of significance that statisticians usually use. The functions of thesegenes are far-ranging. They’re involved in neurogenesis, the growth of newneurons in response to novel experiences and learning; protecting the bodyagainst various influences that tend to age cells; regulating cell repair,including the ability to move stem cells to those sites in the body where theyare needed to repair damaged or aging tissue; building cellular structures,especially the cytoskeleton (the framework of rigid molecules that give ourcells shape and form); eliminating free radicals, and so decreasing oxidativestress (associated with aging and many major health conditions); and helping ourbodies identify and eliminate cancerous cells, thereby suppressing the growth ofcancer tumors. Activating the genes for neurogenesis was particularlysignificant because most of the time our students were in meditation, they wereso present in their inner world of imagination that their brains believed theywere in the actual event. See Figure 5.15 [../Text/chapter05.xhtml#fig5.15]below to learn what each of these genes does and why it is important for ourhealth.image [../Images/p168.jpg]These are the specific genes that were regulated in four days in our AdvancedWorkshop in Tampa, Florida, in 2017.If our students have changed their gene expression by creating elevated emotionsin just a few days, imagine what you can do if you practice this meditation fora few weeks. By using this breath technique to release the familiar emotionsstored in the body from years of thinking and feeling the same way, and then byemotionally rehearsing new states every day, with practice these unlimitedemotions will become the new normal for you. Your brain will think differentthoughts equal to those elevated emotions. Finally, by embracing these unlimitedemotions instead of the same limited ones, when you understand that you aresignaling new genes and making new proteins that are responsible for the changein structure and function of your body, you can assign more meaning to what youare doing. That leads to a greater intention, which creates an even greateroutcome.It is a scientific fact that we use about 1.5 percent of our DNA. The rest iscalled junk DNA. There is a principle in biology called endowment that holdsthat nature never wastes anything that it is not going to use. In other words,if the junk DNA is there, there must be a reason—otherwise nature in itsinfinite wisdom would have evolved it away (because the universal law is if youdon’t use it you lose it). So think of your genes as a library of potentials.There are infinite combinations of gene variations that can be expressed inthose latent genes. They are waiting for you to activate them. There are genesfor an unlimited genius mind, for longevity, for immortality, for anuncompromising will, for the capacity to heal, for having mystical experiences,for regenerating tissues and organs, for activating the hormones of youth so youhave greater energy and vitality, for photographic memory, and for doing theuncommon, just to name a few.It’s all equal to your imagination and creativity. As you signal any of thosegenes ahead of the environment, your body will express a greater potential byexpressing new genes to make new proteins for a greater expression of life. Sowhen I ask you to feel certain elevated emotions when you recondition the bodyto a new mind, know that as you embrace each emotion, you are knocking on yourown genetic door. So I invite you to surrender to the process and fully engagein the experience.Reconditioning the Body to a New Mind MeditationBefore we start the formal meditation, we are going to do some practicesessions. They build on several individual instructions so you can learn thisstep by step. Once you’ve mastered each individual step, we can put it alltogether. So let’s start by sitting up straight in a chair and putting both feetflat on the floor, or sitting on the floor in the lotus (cross-legged) positionwith a pillow under your buttocks. Place your hands uncrossed in your lap. Ifyou like, you can close your eyes.When you’re ready to begin, lift up your perineum, your pelvic floor—the samemuscles that you use for intercourse and elimination. Do not hold your breath asyou do this—breathe normally. Squeeze those muscles as tightly as you can andhold for five seconds; then let go and relax. Do it again and hold it for thesame amount of time. Do it a third time, holding it for about five seconds, andthen relax again. I want you to gain conscious control over these musclesbecause you are going to be using them in a different way.Now contract the same muscles in the perineum and at the same time contract themuscles in your lower abdomen. Pull your lower abdomen up and in, locking downthese first two centers. Hold for five seconds and then relax. Pull those samemuscles up and in again and squeeze. Hold for five seconds again, and thenrelax. Repeat this once more. Remember to keep breathing as you do this—don’thold your breath.Now, this next time, squeeze the muscles of your perineum, and at the same timesqueeze the muscles of your lower abdomen while also contracting the muscles ofyour upper abdomen. You’re tightening your entire core now—the first threecenters. Hold all of those muscles for five seconds and relax. Do this again,pulling the muscles in a little more this time. Hold for five seconds and thenrelax. Now do it one more time, and as you squeeze and hold those muscles, seeif you can squeeze them a little tighter and lift them a little higher. Hold fora while and then relax.Since experience creates neurological networks in your brain, as you performeach step and build on the previous one, you are installing the neurologicalhardware in your brain in preparation for the experience. I am asking you to usethe same muscles that you might have used for years, but now in a different way.This action will begin to milk these centers and liberate energy that’s beenstored in your body for a very long time.Now we’re going to change it up. Take your finger and place it on the top ofyour head, and work your fingernail right into the center of your scalp so youwill remember where that point is once you take your finger away. Remember thatwhere you place your attention is where you place your energy, so that point isyour target. Put your hands back in your lap and without contracting any musclesyet, take one slow, steady breath through your nose. All I want you to do isfollow your breath from your perineum, through your lower abdomen, through yourupper abdomen, through the center of your chest, through your throat, throughyour brain, all the way to the top of your head where your finger was. When youget to the top of your head, hold your breath and keep your attention right onthe top of your head and let your energy follow your awareness. Hold for aboutten seconds and then relax.Place your finger on the top of your head again, then take it away and make sureyou can feel that point without your finger there. Rest your hands on yourthighs. Now do one more breath without contracting any muscles. This time whenyou inhale through your nose, imagine you are pulling energy up that tube—likedrawing fluid up a straw—all the way to the top of your head. When you get tothe top of your head, hold your breath for about the same amount of time you didbefore, and let your energy follow your awareness—then relax.Now it’s time to start putting it all together. With this next breath, when youinhale through your nose, pull those muscles up and in at the exact same time.Start by locking the muscles of your perineum, engaging the muscles of yourlower abdomen and simultaneously contracting the muscles in your upper abdomen.And as you squeeze the muscles in each center—with the intention of pulling allof that stored energy in the lower body into the brain—follow your breaththrough each of those three centers. As you continue to squeeze those musclesand lock those first three centers down, pull your breath up through your chest(the fourth center), then through your throat (the fifth center), then throughyour brain (the sixth center). Pull it all the way up to the top of your head,keep your attention there, and hold your breath as you keep squeezing your coremuscles. Hold for about ten seconds and then relax as you exhale.Repeat that breath at least two more times, tightening the muscles of your firstthree centers as you pull your breath up your spine through each energy centerall the way to the top of your head. Then hold your breath for a time, andfinally relax as you exhale.Remember, as you do this, you’re using your body as an instrument ofconsciousness and your full intent should be to pull the mind out of the body.You’re liberating energy that has been locked in your lower three centers andmoving it up to the higher centers where you can use it for healing your body orcreating something new, instead of just for survival.Practicing this many times so you are very familiar with these steps will bevery useful before you begin several of the meditations in this book. Be patientwith yourself; just like learning anything for the first time, you have to dothis many times before you truly master it. In the beginning, it may feelawkward because you have to synchronize the actions of your body with theintention of your mind. Eventually, though, if you practice this techniqueenough, you will be able to coordinate all of these steps into one motion.I am aware that there are many different breathing techniques, and you may wellhave had success with one or more of them in the past. Even so, I urge you totry this one, even if you already have some other favorite, because if you dosomething new, you can have a new experience. If you keep doing the same thing,you will keep creating the same experience. And if you do nothing, you getnothing. Yes, this technique takes some real effort, but once you become moreskilled, you’ll see it’s worth the effort and then some.You are now ready to begin the formal meditation. If you purchase myReconditioning the Body to a New Mind CD or audio download fromdrjoedispenza.com [http://drjoedispenza.com], you’ll find the recording includesa song I’ve specifically chosen to truly inspire you to raise your energy. Asyou listen, I want you to interpret the music as the movement of energy. If youdo the meditation on your own, practice the breath while you listen to oneinspiring song that’s between four and seven minutes long. Then open your focus,putting your attention on different parts of your body as well as the spacearound those parts of the body. Next, unfold as pure consciousness into theunified field, staying in the generous present moment and becoming no body, noone, no thing, no where and in no time.Now it’s time to cultivate several elevated emotions one by one, emotionallyrehearsing each. Remember: The more powerful your feelings, the more you areup-regulating your own genes. Bless your body, bless your life, bless your soul,bless your future as well as your past, bless the challenges in your life, andbless the intelligence within you that is giving you life. Finish by givingthanks for a new life before it has been made manifest."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 6 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t6]image [../Images/line.jpg]CASE STUDIES: LIVING EXAMPLES OF TRUTH [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t6]image [../Images/line.jpg]Over the years, I’ve found that stories serve a great purpose: to reinforceinformation in a practical manner. Hearing about someone else’s experience makesit more real for us. Once we can relate to the challenges and triumphs a personhas along their journey from one state of consciousness to another, we start tobelieve a similar experience can happen for us. Stories also make the ideas fromthe teachings become less philosophical and more personal.The case studies that you are about to read concern real people who have appliedthe information you just learned in the previous chapters. They first understoodthe concepts as intellectual knowledge in their minds, then they applied it andexperienced it in their bodies, and finally they turned it into wisdom in theirsouls. For these students to accomplish such supernatural changes, theyultimately had to master some aspect or limitation in themselves—and if theycould do it, so can you.Ginny Heals Her Chronic Back and Leg PainOn December 9, 2013, Ginny was driving on the highway in Las Vegas when her carwas hit from behind. Even though she slammed on the brakes, the impactcatapulted her car into the car in front of her, resulting in a double impact.She immediately felt a burning sensation in her lower back as pain shot down herright leg. When the paramedics arrived, she described her pain as moderate, butover the next few days, the pain increased until it was constant and severe.Most of her pain was in her lower lumbar spine, caused by two herniated discs(L4 and L5). She also felt pain radiating all the way down her right leg to herfoot.Ginny saw a chiropractor three times a week, but the pain worsened. She then sawa pain management doctor who prescribed muscle relaxants, Neurontin (a nervepain medication), and Mobic (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug). After ninemonths, the pain was still intense, so she had injections in her back. Theydidn’t help.As a result, Ginny had difficulty walking and found driving almost impossible.She also had trouble sleeping, managing to get only four or five hours a night.The constant pain in her lower back became worse when she was sitting, liftingsomething, or standing for long periods of time. Sometimes she could sit foronly 20 minutes at a time. Because of all this, she spent most of her days inbed, where she was able to find a little relief when lying on her right sidewith her knees bent.Ginny was unable to care for her two children, ages three and five, and she wasalso unable to work as much as she had before. She depended on her husband todrive her places since she could no longer drive herself. All of these factorscreated serious financial problems and emotional stress for the whole family.Ginny became depressed and angry at life. Although she had attended her firstworkshop with me before the accident and had been doing her meditations, afterthe accident she stopped meditating regularly because the pain got too severeand she said she couldn’t sit or concentrate.After two years, her doctor suggested lumbar surgery to repair the herniateddiscs. If that didn’t work, he said, Ginny could consider additional surgery,including spinal fusion. She decided to go ahead with the initial surgery.In the meantime, Ginny’s husband convinced her to attend another one of myadvanced seminars in Seattle, which started just one week before her surgerydate. Staying seated for the flight was painful, but she made it. While Ginnyenjoyed seeing her old friends and meeting new ones at the event, she also feltsaddened and frustrated because she couldn’t muster the same enthusiasm everyoneelse had. She just wanted to take some painkillers and go to bed. When she wasleaving the first night’s gathering, her good friend Jill, filled withcompassion and hope, said with conviction, “Ginny, you will be healedtomorrow—right here!” We started the next day at 6:00 A.M. Ginny decided toavoid taking any heavy medications so she could be present in the meditationsand enjoy the experience. Unfortunately, her pain made it very difficult tofocus during the first meditation and she wondered if the decision to attend hadbeen a mistake.During the second meditation after breakfast, though, things really shifted.Ginny decided to surrender and leave all her judgment behind. The meditationbegan as usual with the breathing exercise of pulling the mind out of the body,during which I told the participants to focus on two or three negative emotionsor limited aspects of their personality. I asked them to move all that storedenergy from the first three energy centers up from the base of their spine, allthe way up to their brain—and eventually release it out of the top of theirheads.First, Ginny chose to work with her anger, which she believed had been acontributing factor in keeping her body in so much pain. During the meditation,she felt energy moving up her spine and then sensed an intense energy leavingher body through the back of her head. The second thing she picked to work withwas her pain. As she worked with the breath to move much of the energy relatedto her pain from her body to her brain, she felt the same energy she had whenshe was working with anger, although this time she saw the energy become abright color with purple overtones. Suddenly, she sensed the energy slow downand become less intense. The music changed, and the main part of the meditationbegan. Ginny was feeling completely relaxed. She had liberated that energy outof her body.As usual, I guided the group to feel different parts of their bodies in spaceand to sense the space around their bodies. Then I guided them to the infiniteblack space that is the quantum field. I asked them to become no body, no one,no thing, no where, in no time and to become pure awareness—aware that they areaware in this endless vast space. At first, as I gave the instructions, Ginnyhad the distinct sense that she was floating. An intense sense of peace andunconditional love overtook her, and she lost track of time and space. Shedidn’t feel her physical body at all, nor did she feel any pain. Yet she wasfully present and could hear and follow all the instructions I was giving.“I never experienced anything like that before,” she told me later. “It was soprofound that it’s difficult to put into words. My senses were magnified, and Ifelt connected to everybody, everyone, everything, every place, and every time.I was part of the whole, and the whole was part of me. There was no separation.”Ginny got beyond her body, her environment, and time. Her consciousness hadconnected to the consciousness of the unified field (the place she describedwhere there’s only wholeness and there’s no separation). She had found the sweetspot of the generous present moment, and her autonomic nervous system stepped inand did the healing for her.In our advanced workshops, our students lie down after every meditation andsurrender in order to allow the autonomic nervous system to take over andprogram their bodies. At the end of this meditation, when I asked everyone tocome back to their new bodies, Ginny was surprised to discover that she feltabsolutely no pain as she got up from the floor to stand—a process that shenormally would have needed help with. She started walking without limping, herback straight.We broke for lunch, but Ginny didn’t feel like eating much or even talking alot. She was still overwhelmed with the meditation experience. After two yearsof near-constant pain, it felt so freeing to be without it anymore. She startedcrying tears of joy and confusion simultaneously. She looked for two of herfriends to share the good news, including Jill (who had been so sure the nightbefore that Ginny would be healed). They encouraged Ginny to try movements thatshe hadn’t been able to do when she was in pain—and she performed all of themwithout any pain at all. As the day continued, Ginny’s pain stayed away, and shecontinued to feel connected to the unified field.That evening, Ginny called her husband, who told her that somehow he just knewshe’d be able to heal her pain at the workshop. She had a great dinner with herfriends, and when she went to bed, she didn’t take any of her pain medication ormuscle relaxers. She slept through the night for the very first time in years,waking up filled with energy. The next day, I guided the group in a walkingmeditation (which you will read about and have a chance to try later). Ginny wasable to walk straight and tall, with no pain or difficulty. Needless to say, shecancelled the surgery, and she has remained pain free.Daniel Deals with Electromagnetic HypersensitivityAbout five years ago, Daniel was (as he put it) a “crazy, stressed-out, Israelientrepreneur” in his mid-20s who pushed himself daily to work at “full power allthe way” to build a successful business. Working 60-hour weeks was typical forhim. One day, while he was raging and yelling at the top of his lungs at aclient over the phone, he felt something pop in the right side of his head andhe lost consciousness. When he woke, he wasn’t sure what had happened or howlong he had been out, but he had the worst headache of his life. He hopedresting would help it go away, but it didn’t.Mysteriously, his pain increased exponentially whenever he was near anythingthat emitted electromagnetic frequencies, including cell phones, laptops, videodisplays, microphones, cameras, Wi-Fi networks, and cell towers. If someone nearhim answered a cell phone, Daniel felt it. He’d never before experiencedanything like this—in fact, he had previously worked in the computer field andnever felt any ill effects from being around electronic equipment of any kind.Daniel saw several different doctors and specialists, but none of them couldfind anything wrong with him. He went through an extensive battery of bloodtests, brain scans, and physical examinations, but every one of the studies cameback negative. Some of the doctors didn’t believe him and even becamecondescending, rolling their eyes as if Daniel were making up his symptoms. Somewanted to give him antidepressants, but he wouldn’t take them. They told him hispain was all in his head (which, of course, it was, but not in the way thedoctors meant).Then Daniel started seeing holistic doctors who suspected he had developed arare condition called electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS). While theexistence of EHS is still controversial in the medical community, the WorldHealth Organization recognizes the condition.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch6_nt1]The mechanism of EHS remains unknown, but when you consider that the brain is 78percent water and that water containing minerals (such as those commonly foundin the body, including calcium and magnesium) conducts electricity, you can seethat for EHS-sensitive people, that natural electromagnetic charge might somehowbecome amplified around things that signal and emit electromagnetic radiation.Like many others with EHS, Daniel also experienced chronic pain and fatigue inaddition to his headaches. He’d sleep for 12 hours and still wake up exhausted.One of the holistic doctors suggested he take 40 nutritional supplements a dayto combat the ill effects, but the supplements didn’t help. He was still innear-constant agony. Before long, Daniel had to close his business. He went intodebt and lost everything he had worked so hard to acquire. Finally, he declaredbankruptcy and had to move in with his mother.“I basically retreated from life,” he told me. “I was a zombie because Icouldn’t think, I couldn’t focus, I couldn’t do anything. Nothing I did helped,and whenever I got anywhere near the real world, I got a really strongheadache.” In fact, Daniel told me that if he was ever near anything thatemitted a signal, his headaches would be a thousand times worse—to the pointthat he would emotionally break down. Daniel spent most of his time curled up ina ball on his bed in his tiny room in his mother’s house, crying from the pain.“I was wasting my life,” he said, “watching all my friends get married, havechildren, get promoted, buy houses—everything.” When he began to feel suicidal,his friends and family pushed him to try to find something that would help.Because of the chronic fatigue, depression, and severe pain, Daniel had onlyabout a half hour of energy each day, so he started to use that time to findsomething that might help his condition. Three years after his symptoms began,he read my book You Are the Placebo.“Something clicked,” he told me when I met him in a workshop I gave recently. “Iknew this was the solution.” So he started doing the Changing Beliefs andPerceptions meditation I talk about in that book. Very gradually, over time,Daniel felt a little less pain, so he kept doing the meditation. After a while,he discovered my Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation, and he started doingthat.“The very first time I did it,” Daniel told me, “something happened that Ididn’t know how to explain.” When he got to the sixth energy center, he said itwas like a light show was going on in his head. He saw different areas of hisbrain that had been shut down suddenly start lighting up and communicating witheach other. Then a huge beam of what he described as “loving light” shot out ofthe top of his head. His inward experience in that moment was more real than thememory of the past experience, which had created the pain in the first place.From that point on, Daniel noticed a significant change. After meditating, hewould have ten minutes without any pain at all. The pain-free periods keptgetting longer and longer until a few months later, he was pain free. Then hegot the idea that he should use the meditations to change his internal statewhile he was exposed to the electromagnetic fields that had been making himsick. So he started meditating in front of his cell phone and laptop. It waspainful at first, but just as before, he’d eventually feel free of pain aftermeditating, and then those pain-free periods kept getting longer as time woreon.Finally, Daniel was ready to take another big step. He hired a desk in a sharedoffice space and decided to just sit there and meditate, surrounded by Wi-Fi,computers, microwaves, and all sorts of electromagnetic frequencies. Althoughthe first few weeks were difficult, he found that it became easier as time woreon. After a while, he was meditating in that environment without pain for fivehours a day. Eventually, his headaches just disappeared—and so did all hischronic pain and fatigue.Today, Daniel considers himself 100 percent healed. He went back to work and gotout of debt. Here’s the kicker: Daniel works only about an hour to an hour and ahalf a day, and he’s making way more money than he was when he was stressed outand trying to force his life into working the way he wanted it to. He’s alsotruly enjoying life.Jennifer, in Sickness and in HealthFive years ago, Jennifer’s doctor diagnosed her with several new illnesses, inaddition to the numerous other health issues she already suffered from. Intotal, her diagnoses included a few autoimmune disorders (lupus erythematosusand Sjögren’s syndrome with sicca complex), some gastrointestinal disorders(celiac disease, salicylate intolerance, and lactose intolerance), chronicasthma, kidney disease, arthritis, and vertigo so acute it often resulted invomiting.Every day was a struggle. Even just brushing her teeth was difficult because shelacked enough strength to hold her arm up for very long. Her partner, Jim, oftenhad to brush her hair for her. When Jim was away on business, which was often,Jennifer had to take a nap after work so she could have enough strength to cookdinner.“The hardest thing was that I felt like a terrible mother because I couldn’t doanything with my boys—and that broke my heart,” she told me. “I would have tosleep most of the weekend just to be able to get up to go to work Mondaymorning. All the happy pictures I posted on Facebook during the weekend werecaptured in about one hour.”By this point, Jennifer weighed only 108 pounds and struggled to walk due toarthritis and severe swelling in her ankles and knees. She could no longer useher right hand to open containers or cut vegetables because of the pain andarthritis. At times she would lie in bed and hit her arms against her nighttable to stop the pain. Her body was in a constant state of acute inflammation,and even the specialists she saw said they couldn’t do anything more for her andthat she had to learn to live with all her conditions as best she could.Although she never admitted it to anyone, she feared she might only have a fewyears left to live. She may have been ready to give up, but Jim wasn’t.Every night Jim devoured books looking for alternative solutions, repeatedlyencouraging Jennifer to keep going. Then Jim found You Are the Placebo and readabout a woman with a similar condition who was able to heal herself. Jenniferand Jim agreed that she had to go to a workshop.Two months later, in June 2014, Jennifer attended a weekend workshop in Sydney,Australia. She started to feel a bit better and registered for an advancedworkshop in Mexico. Unfortunately, around the time she was scheduled to leavefor the workshop, she developed an 8.5-millimeter kidney stone, and her doctorrefused to let her fly. So she missed it, but she kept doing her meditations(getting up at 4:50 A.M. every day), and when I held the next advanced workshopin Australia the following year, both she and Jim attended.“I remember the first night I could hardly make it up the stairs to our room,which was normal for me,” she reported. “But by the end of the workshop, I waswalking around like a healthy person and didn’t have to use my asthmamedication. The day before we left, Jim said that I was looking so well I shouldtry some normal food. Apprehensive, I gave it a go—and no adverse effects! Nopain, no asthma, no cramps, no headache—nothing! I think it was the best pizzaI’ve ever had.”When she did her meditations, Jennifer really gave it her all. She repeatedlytuned in to the potential of health and felt an abundance of energy throughouther body that could carry her all day long. In the meditation, when I asked thestudents to live from that new state of being, she imagined her feet hitting theground and heard her breath as she joyfully ran. By the end of her meditation,she was crying tears of joy. Eventually, Jennifer conditioned her body to forgetwhat illness feels like, looks like, sounds like, and tastes like by raising herenergy, changing her frequency, reconditioning her body to a new mind, andsignaling new genes to repair her body.“Now I eat normal food,” she reports, “and I haven’t used my asthma medicationsince June 2015. I can walk up to ten miles a day and lift forty-five pounds.I’m training, and my goal is to complete a half marathon, which I will soon do.”Felicia Overcomes Severe EczemaFelicia had intermittently suffered from eczema and skin infections since shewas three months old. The short-term relief provided by a strict diet and aregime of medications (creams, steroids, antihistamines, antifungals,antibiotics, and so on) never seemed to keep the condition at bay for long.In 2016, as a 34-year-old medical doctor in the United Kingdom, Felicia foundherself becoming increasingly frustrated by the limitations of her profession.After a decade of clinical practice where she’d seen more than 70,000 patients,she began to recognize a similar sense of frustration and disconnect emergingfrom her patients as well. While seeking more satisfying science-basedsolutions, she came across my work. Intrigued by possibility and hungry foralternative evidence-based ideas and solutions, Felicia signed up for a weekendworkshop.“The event was life changing,” she says. “It gave me the tools to reevaluate andupdate my previous limited beliefs about myself, as well as what our bodies aretruly capable of.” The breathing technique was particularly intriguing to her.“I must confess,” she says, “that I remained a little skeptical and held back,not allowing myself to truly surrender to the process.”During the months that followed, Felicia continued to meditate daily. Her skinimproved and she successfully manifested a new relationship in her life. Feelinginspired, she sought new ways to pivot within her medical practice to adopt amore holistic approach. But to her great disappointment, all the United Kingdommedical indemnity bodies refused to insure any nonconventional approaches.Felicia felt trapped, and in December 2016, her eczema and skin infectionsreturned.Even so, she continued meditating and even signed up for an advanced workshop,creating her Mind Movie in preparation (a powerful tool for manifesting variousthings you want, which you will read about in a later chapter). She had veryclear intentions for her future and included images of healthy skin, as well asa picture of a microphone on a stage with the affirmation “I inspire others bysharing truth fearlessly.”On the first day of the advanced workshop, we did the breathing technique toactivate the pineal gland, and this time, Felicia decided not to hold back andto completely surrender to the process. “I noticed my breathing begin tohasten,” she remembers. “An overwhelming energy started building in my throat.This intensified until my throat felt as if it was going to close up. Fearful, Ipulled my body out of this position and returned back to my old state of beingfor the remainder of the meditation.”The following day, for the last meditation, Felicia was being fitted with thebrain mapping equipment. She considered what an amazing opportunity it was toexperience this new level of information. Feeling trapped in a profession thatpreaches limitation, she had the thought: What if I could demonstrate to theskeptic, as well as to believers, how unlimited we all really are? With thisthought, she wanted to use this breath to connect to the unified field—with anelevated emotion of pure freedom and liberation—no matter what happened.When the meditation began, she opened up to possibility and to the unknown. Shequickly noticed that her breathing started to change and the overwhelming energybegan to build in her throat. Each time the sensations intensified, instead ofallowing them to overcome her as she had done the previous day, she stayed withthe process. She returned her body to the present moment, ignoring thedistraction, and placed all her energy and awareness on connecting to the field,to truth, and to love. Her body was persistently defiant, but after repeatedlyovercoming her internal struggles, her body eventually surrendered.“What I experienced on the other side was an exhilarating explosion of energy inmy brain and an instantaneous connection with a loving consciousness within andall around me,” she says. “It was an absolute knowing, a recognition of purelove, and with it came the most overwhelming emotion of joy that I’ve everexperienced in my entire life. It was like coming home. I just experienced thisdeep oneness. All the while I remained completely aware of all my externalsenses. I could hear the scientists behind me saying ‘seizure.’” We had some newmembers on our team of neuroscientists, and they had never seen that kind ofenergy in the brain before.As a medical doctor, Felicia might normally have been concerned at that somewhatalarming statement, but she understood that in that moment she was experiencingabsolute truth and freedom for the very first time. For a few hours followingher meditation, she felt somewhat dazed but physically lighter than before.If you review the brain scans in Graphics 7A–7C, you can see Felicia’s brainshowing the classic changes that we witness when there is high energy in thebrain. She starts in normal beta brain waves and then transitions into high-betabrain waves before she hits a high-energy gamma state. The energy in gamma brainwaves is 190 standard deviations above normal. The area surrounding the pinealgland as well as the part of the brain that processes strong emotion is highlyactivated.During the next few days, Felicia began to experience a sense of fearlessnessand playfulness emerging from within her. She also experienced a string ofsynchronicities—including manifesting the scene from her Mind Movie where shewas speaking into a microphone onstage. In fact, without knowing that scene hadbeen in her Mind Movie, I pulled her onstage to share her experience. It wasonly once she returned home that she noticed her eczema was no longer botheringher.“I looked at my skin, and all the rashes that had been there just a few daysprior had completely resolved,” she reported. (Look at Graphic 7D in the colorinsert. The first pictures were taken before the event. The second set ofpictures was taken the next day, after the event. Her eczema is gone.)To this day Felicia takes no further medication and her skin is clear. Her lifecontinues to unfold in new, exciting, and surprising ways.“I am so grateful for the realization that we are all unlimited,” she told me.“Mark my words, if a once jaded, intensely analytical doctor can do it,absolutely anyone can.”"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 7 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t7]image [../Images/line.jpg]HEART INTELLIGENCE [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t7]image [../Images/line.jpg]Since our human ancestors first began etching their histories upon cave wallsand stone tablets, like a thread through the needle of time, the heart hasappeared as a symbol to represent health, wisdom, intuition, guidance, andhigher intelligence. The ancient Egyptians, who referred to the heart as ieb,believed the heart, rather than the brain, was the center of life and the sourceof human wisdom. The Mesopotamians and the Greeks both thought of the heart asthe center of the soul. The Greeks, however, considered it an independent sourceof heat within the body, while the Mesopotamians believed it was a fragment ofthe sun’s heat. They even performed human sacrifices whereby they extracted astill-beating human heart to offer it to the Sun God. The Romans understood theheart to be the body’s most life-giving vital organ.In the 17th century, during the early years of the scientific revolution, Frenchphilosopher René Descartes argued that mind and body were two radically distinctsubstances. Through this mechanistic view of the universe, people began to viewthe heart as an extraordinary machine. The mechanism of the heart as a physicalpump began to overshadow its nature as humanity’s connection to an innateintelligence. Through scientific inquiry, the heart slowly ceased to berecognized as our connection to feelings, emotions, and our higher selves. Ithas only been through the new science of the last few decades that we’ve beganto reconcile, understand, and recognize the true significance of the heart bothas a source that generates electromagnetic fields and as our connection to theunified field.We know that the heart, beyond its obvious role in sustaining life, is notsimply a muscular pump that moves blood throughout our body but an organ capableof influencing feelings and emotions. The heart is a sensory organ that guidesour decision-making ability as well as our understanding of ourselves and ourplace in the world. It’s a symbol that transcends time, place, and culture. It’sa commonly accepted premise that when we are connected to the heart’s innerknowing, we can tap into its wisdom as a source of love and higher guidance.You may well be wondering why it is that out of all the organs in the body (suchas the spleen, liver, or kidneys), the heart is the only one to haveintelligence. Since 2013, we’ve gone to great lengths to measure and quantifycoherence and transformation, which are central to understanding the heart’srole. Almost everyone recognizes that the elevated feelings of the heart connectus to the consciousness of love, compassion, gratitude, joy, unity, acceptance,and selflessness. These are feelings that fill us up and make us feel whole andconnected, rather than the feelings of stress that divide communities and drainus of vital energy. The problem is that these elevated feelings of the heartoften occur through chance—dependent upon something external in ourenvironment—rather than as something we can produce for ourselves on demand.Without a doubt, it’s a challenge to maintain our mental and emotionalequilibrium in today’s fast paced, stress-filled, productivity-focused,hurry-up-and-finish culture, and the loss of this equilibrium can have seriousramifications for our health. For instance, at the turn of the 20th century,hardly anyone died of heart disease, while today it’s the leading cause of deathfor both men and women. Each year in the United States alone, heart diseasecosts approximately $207 billion in health care services, medications, and lostproductivity.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt1] Stress is one of the maincontributing factors to heart disease, and it’s reaching an epidemic level.Fortunately, there’s an antidote. What we’ve found in researching and studyingthe many facets of heart coherence is that we can in fact regulate our internalstates, independent of the conditions in our external environment. Just likedeveloping any skill, voluntarily creating heart coherence requires knowledge,application, and practice.Integral to our understanding of the heart has been our partnership with thepioneering, groundbreaking work of the HeartMath Institute. HMI is a nonprofitresearch and education organization that works to better understand heart-braincoherence. Since 1991, HMI has researched and developed reliable, scientificallybased tools to help people bridge the connection between their hearts and minds,as well as deepen their connection with the hearts of others. Their mission isto help people bring their physical, mental, and emotional systems into balancedalignment through the intuitive guidance of the heart.The foundation of our partnership is built upon the shared belief that in orderto create a new future, a person needs to marry a clear intention (coherentbrain) with an elevated emotion (coherent heart). HMI’s research has proven thatby combining an intention or thought (which, as you have read, acts as theelectrical charge) with a feeling or emotion (which you already understand actsas a magnetic charge), we can change our biological energy—and when we changeour energy, we change our lives. It’s the union of these two elements thatproduces measurable effects on matter, moving our biology away from living inthe familiar past to living in the new future. At our workshops across theworld, we teach our students to maintain and sustain these elevated states ofbeing so they can cease living as victims of circumstance, swinging from oneemotion to the next, and begin living as the creators of their reality. This isthe process whereby we create a new state of being—or a new personality, whichcreates a new personal reality.For the past several years, one of the goals of our partnership with HMI hasbeen to teach our students to intentionally regulate and sustain somethingcalled heart coherence. Like the regular beating of a drum, heart coherencerefers to the physiological function of the heart that causes it to beat in aconsistent, rhythmic, orderly manner (the opposite, when it is not operating inan orderly manner, is heart incoherence). When we are in heart coherence, we canaccess the “heart’s intelligence,” which HMI defines as:The flow of awareness and insight that we experience once the mind and emotionsare brought into balance and coherence through a self-initiated process. Thisform of intelligence is experienced as direct, intuitive knowing that manifestsin thought and emotions that are beneficial for ourselves and others.2[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt2]As you’ll discover in this chapter, the benefits of heart coherence arenumerous, including lowering blood pressure, improving the nervous system andhormonal balance, and improving brain function. When you maintain and sustainelevated emotional states, independent of the conditions of your externalenvironment, you can gain access to the kind of high-level intuition thatfosters a better understanding of yourself and others, helps prevent stressfulpatterns in your life, increases mental clarity, and promotes better decisionmaking.3 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt3] In addition to HMI’s researchfindings, our data strongly suggests that sustained heart-centered emotionspromote healthier gene expression.4 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt4]Heart coherence begins with the steady, coherent drumbeat of the heart throughcultivating, practicing, and sustaining elevated emotions; such emotions includegratitude, appreciation, thankfulness, inspiration, freedom, kindness,selflessness, compassion, love, and joy. The benefits of that coherent beat arefelt throughout all systems of the body. Consciously or unconsciously, many ofus practice feeling unhappy, angry, or fearful each day. So why not practicecreating and maintaining joyful, loving, altruistic states instead? Wouldn’tthat eventually create a new internal order, resulting in overall health andhappiness?The Heart BridgeAs you read in the chapter on blessing the energy centers, the heart, locatedright behind the breastbone, is the body’s fourth energy center. It is ourbridge to greater levels of awareness and energy, as well as the center whereour divinity begins. The heart is the intersection of our lower three energycenters (associated with our earthly body) and our upper three energy centers(associated with our higher self). It serves as our connection to the unifiedfield and represents the union of duality or polarity. It is where separation,division, and polarized energy merge to become one—where opposites unify as theyin and the yang, good and bad, positive and negative, male and female, past andfuture.When your heart becomes coherent, your nervous system responds by increasing thebrain’s energy, creativity, and intuition, which has a positive effect onvirtually every organ in the body. Now the heart and the brain are workingtogether, causing you to feel more whole, connected, and content—not only withinyour own body, but also with everything and everybody. When you are in aheart-centered state, the wholeness you feel consumes any feelings you may haveof want and lack. From this creative state of wholeness and oneness, magicbegins to happen in your life because you’re no longer creating from duality orseparation—you’re no longer waiting for something outside of you to providerelief from the internal feelings of lack, emptiness, or separation. Instead,you are becoming more familiar with your new, ideal self and creating newexperiences of yourself. If you keep activating your heart center properlyenough times during the creative process each day, in time you will feel morelike your future has already happened. How can you ever want or feel lack if youfeel whole?If the first three centers reflect our animal nature and are based on polarity,opposites, competition, need, and lack, the fourth center begins our journey toour divine nature. It is from within this heart center that we change our mindand energy from living in selfish states to living in selfless states, and thenwe feel less affected by separation or duality and are more prone to makechoices for the greatest good of everyone.All of us have felt the consciousness of the heart center at one time or anotherin our lives. This energy is related to being fulfilled and at peace withyourself and your surroundings. When we embrace the feelings related to theheart—feelings that lead us to give, nurture, serve, care, help, forgive, love,trust, and so on—we can’t help but feel filled up, whole, and complete. Ibelieve this to be our innate nature as human beings.Homeostasis, Coherence, and ResilienceAs you have now learned, the autonomic nervous system, the involuntary divisionof the nervous system, is divided into two subsystems: the sympathetic nervoussystem and the parasympathetic nervous system. As you know, the sympatheticnervous system when switched on regulates the body’s unconscious actions andresponses, such as increased breathing, elevated heart rate, excessperspiration, dilation of the pupils, and so on. Its primary function is tostimulate the fight-or-flight response when real or perceived danger isimminent. This system works to protect us in our outer environment. Theparasympathetic nervous system complements the sympathetic nervous system inthat it performs the exact opposite functions. Its role is to conserve energy,relax the body, and slow the high-energy functions of the sympathetic system.The parasympathetic system maintains protection in our inner environment. If youthink of the ANS as an automobile, the parasympathetic system would be the brakeand the sympathetic system the accelerator. Both branches of the ANScontinuously relay communications between the heart and the brain; in fact, theheart and the brain have more nerve connections to each other than any othersystems in the body.5 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt5] These two systems, thesympathetic and parasympathetic, are always working to maintain a state ofhomeostasis (relative equilibrium between all systems) within the body.When the body is in a state of homeostasis, we generally feel relaxed and safewithin our current environment. From this state of homeostasis, where all thebody’s systems are working in harmony and minimal amounts of energy are wasted,we can intentionally affect the nervous system to create coherence. In order tofeel these emotions of coherence, the neural connections between the heart andbrain must be functioning optimally in a balanced and coordinated manner. Whenthe heart is beating in such an orderly, coherent fashion, it brings the ANSinto coherence, which in turn improves our brain functions by causing us to feelmore creative, focused, rational, aware, and open to learning.As you know, the opposite of coherence is incoherence. When the heart is beatingincoherently, we feel out of balance, on edge, anxious, and unfocused. Becausethe body is operating in survival, we function more from an animalistic,primitive perspective than from the higher heart-centered emotions of ourgreater humanity and divinity. Incoherence is brought on by stress, which is thebody and mind’s response to disruptions and upsets in our external environment.If the parasympathetic nervous system functions best when we feel safe, then thesympathetic nervous system is activated mostly when we feel unsafe. The stresswe experience when we feel unsafe is not necessarily about the event itself butthe result of unmanaged emotional reactions to the event.In a state of homeostasis, you can think of the body as a sophisticated, finelytuned machine, but when emotions such as resentment, anger, jealousy,impatience, and frustration persist, our internal equilibrium is thrown out ofbalance. If you think about a time recently when you felt stress, it probablyfelt somewhat like a fragmented rhythm. (As it turns out, this is exactly whatthe heart is doing—beating in a fragmented rhythm.) In a state of chronicstress, the body struggles to maintain homeostasis and we may begin to sufferfrom myriad stress-related symptoms. This constant stress draws from theinvisible energy field around our body and depletes our vital life force,leaving little time or energy for repair and restoration. As a result of thebody’s reliance on the stress hormones, now we’re caught in an addictive loopwhere incoherence and chaos start to feel normal, but at what cost?The long-term effects of stress can be catastrophic. According to one MayoClinic study of people with heart disease, psychological stress was thestrongest predictor of future cardiac events, including cardiac death, cardiacarrest, and heart attack.6 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt6] Many people, becausethey live in states of chronic stress, don’t even realize they are living understress until an event such as a heart attack occurs. It makes sense, then, thatif the heart is beating incoherently for extended periods of time, not workingin balance and order, sooner or later it is going to fail.Key to our ability to manage stress is what’s known as resilience, which HMIdefines as “the capacity to prepare for, recover from, and adapt in the face ofstress, adversity, trauma, or challenge.”7 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt7]Resilience and the management of emotions are both integral to many importantphysiological processes involved in energy regulation, how fast the body bouncesback after the stress response, and our ability to maintain health andhomeostasis.HRV: Communication between the Heart and BrainWe’ve been led to believe that the brain reigns over our biology. While this ispartly true, the heart is an autorhythmic organ, which means the heartbeat isself-initiated from within the heart, not from the brain. For example, it’s aknown fact that in all kinds of species the heart can be removed from the bodyand placed in a salt solution called Ringer’s solution, where it will continueto beat for extended periods of time—independent of any neurological connectionto the brain. In a fetus, the heart begins beating before the brain is evenformed (at about three weeks), while the electrical activity of its braindoesn’t even begin until around the fifth or sixth week.8[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt8] This demonstrates that the heart is capable ofinitiating communication with the central nervous system.Another factor that makes the heart unique is that it contains nerves from bothbranches of the ANS, which means any and every change in both theparasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems affects the way the heart workson a beat-to-beat basis. This is important because whether we are conscious ofit or not, every emotion we experience influences our heart rhythm, which getscommunicated directly through the central nervous system. In this way, theheart, the limbic brain, and the ANS have a very intimate relationship becausebalance or imbalance in one affects the other. (As a side note, the limbicbrain—the seat of the autonomic nervous system—is also called the emotionalbrain, so when you change your emotions, you affect your autonomic functions.)Today, with about 75 percent accuracy, science can predict what someone isfeeling just by looking at the beat-to-beat activity of the heart using heartrate variability analysis.9 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt9]HRV (heart rate variability) is a physiological phenomenon that measuresenvironmental and psychological challenges as reflected by the variation of theheart’s beat-to-beat intervals (thus the term variability). Among its uses, HRVcan measure the flexibility of our heart and nervous system (which reflects ourhealth and fitness), as well as how well we are balancing our mental andemotional lives.10 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt10] By studying the heart’srhythms as measured by HRV, scientists can detect patterns that deepen ourunderstanding of how humans process emotions and the effects of feelings andemotions on our well-being. In this way, continued HRV research offers us aunique window into the communication between the heart, brain, and emotions.11[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt11]Many studies show that having a moderate level of variability makes us betterable to adapt to life’s challenges.12 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt12] But alow level of heart rate variability is a strong and independent predictor offuture health problems, including all causes of mortality.13[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt13] Low HRV is also associated with numerousmedical conditions. When we are young, we have greater variability, but as weage, our variability decreases. HRV patterns are so consistent that whenscientists look at an HRV reading, they can generally estimate the subject’s agewithin approximately two years.For many years, a steady heart rhythm was considered a sign of good health, butnow we know that our heart rhythm changes with each and every heartbeat, evenwhen we are sleeping. Over the years, HMI researchers have discoveredinformation encoded within these beat-to-beat intervals by looking at the spacesbetween heartbeats in HRV readings rather than the spikes related to the beatsthemselves. This is somewhat similar to Morse code, where we understandcommunications by the intervals between transmissions.14[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt14] In the case of our heart, the intervalsbetween its beats are complex transmissions used to relay communications betweenthe brain and body.During the 1990s, researchers at HMI discovered that when people focused ontheir hearts and evoked elevated emotions such as appreciation, joy, gratitude,and compassion, those feelings could be observed as coherent patterns in theheart’s rhythms. The opposite was true of stressful feelings, which caused theheart rhythms to be incoherent and to appear jagged and irregular. Thisdiscovery linked emotional states to HRV patterns (see Figure 7.1).15[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt15] The researchers also observed that heart rate(beats per minute) and heart rhythm were two separate biological responses. Forinstance, a person could have a high heart rate and still maintain a state ofcoherence; therefore it was determined that the heart’s rhythms can createcoherent internal body states.image [../Images/p193.jpg]In some of our advanced workshops, when students break the energetic bonds witheveryone and everything in their past-present reality, they draw from theambient field to build their own individual electromagnetic field. When thisoccurs, the energy of the room can drop. Both figures demonstrate thisphenomenon during two advanced workshops in Australia in 2015 and 2016. The redline is the baseline measurement on Wednesday—the day before the event starts,when no one is in the room. The blue line is Thursday—the first full day. Youcan see that the energy in the room decreased slightly. The green line isFriday—the second day. You can see how the energy of the room continues to riseas students break through on Friday. At this point, instead of drawing energyfrom the field, they are contributing energy to the field.image [../Images/p194.jpg]In the first image, both circles represent a top view of a person wearing an EEGbrain cap. The head is facing forward, so the nose is pointing toward the top ofthe page and ears are on both sides. The tiny white circles represent differentbrain compartments, where we can measure brain waves in those specific areas. Onthe left, you can see how the arrows are all lined up in perfect order, showingthe waves in phase. That’s coherence. On the right, you can see that the wavesof the brain are not in phase and the arrows do not line up with the peaks andvalleys. That’s incoherence.Since I will be showing you different brain scans in the pages ahead, I want tofamiliarize you with how we measure coherence and incoherence. Look at thesecond set of images. If there is a lot of blue in the brain, it means there islow coherence (hypo-coherence) and different areas of the brain communicate lesswith each other. If there is a lot of red in the brain, it means that there ishigh coherence (hyper-coherence) and different areas communicate more with eachother. If there is no blue and no red, it means normal or average coherence.image [../Images/p195.jpg]image [../Images/p196.jpg]Look at each of the thin vertical blue lines on the strip charts in Graphics 3A,3B, and 3C and follow them down to the bottom. You’ll see how they representone-second intervals. Each of the 19 horizontal wavy lines is related todifferent compartments of the brain being measured—the front, both sides, thetop, and the back of the brain. If you count the number of cycles (from the topof one wave to the top of the next wave) between the two blue vertical lines,you will know the brain waves in each individual area of the brain. That’s howwe determine beta, alpha, theta, delta, or gamma brain waves. If you need toreview the different frequencies of brain waves, review Figure 2.7[../Text/chapter02.xhtml#fig2.7].When you go from a narrow focus to an open focus and you take your attention offmatter (some thing) and place your attention on space or energy (no thing), yourbrain waves change from beta to alpha or to theta. Graphic 3A shows a normalthinking busy brain in beta brain waves. Graphic 3B shows a person who is incoherent global alpha brain waves. Notice how beautifully synchronized each partof the brain is when this person opens their focus. The blue arrow pointing tothe peaks shows how the entire brain is coherent in 12-cycles-per-second alphabrain waves. Graphic 3C demonstrates a person in coherent theta brain waves.Once again, the blue arrow pointing to the top of the peaks demonstrates thatthe entire brain is synchronized in about 7 cycles per second, which is thetheta range for brain waves.image [../Images/p197.jpg]The images on the left show GDV measurements of students’ energy centers beforethey started an advanced event. The images on the right side show the changesjust a few days later after the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation.Notice the difference in the size and the alignment of each center.image [../Images/p198.jpg]The images on the left demonstrate some GDV measurements of subjects’ energybefore they started an advanced workshop. The images on the right show thechanges in their vital energy a few days after the workshop.image [../Images/p199.jpg]image [../Images/p200.jpg]Graphics 6A(1), 6A(2), and 6A(3) show a student transitioning to gamma brainwaves as a result of the breath as he passes through high beta. His brain isvery aroused with energy. You can see an obvious change in frequency in thebrain when this occurs (shown by the blue arrows). The amount of energy in hisbrain is 160 standard deviations outside normal. Now look at Graphic 6A(4). Whenthere is a lot of red in the brain, it means there is a lot of energy. Whenthere is blue in the brain, it means there is very little energy. Therefore, thered arrow that points to the totally red circle means there is an enormousamount of energy in high beta brain state as it transitions to gamma. Thesoftware used here does not record gamma brain waves per se, but from viewingthe other measurements in the charts above, we know that the amount of energy inthe brain in the totally red circle reflects gamma as well as high beta. Theblue arrows pointing to the row labeled Coherence show there is intensecommunication along with high energy in all measured brain frequencies.image [../Images/p201.jpg]image [../Images/p202.jpg]You can see a similar transition in these graphics. The blue arrow at the bottomof the strip chart in Graphic 6B(2) shows the moment the brain is moving fromhigh beta to gamma. Graphic 6B(3) shows that the energy in the brain is 260standard deviations above normal. To put this in context, 99.7 percent of thepopulation falls within 3 standard deviations above or below normal. Anythingoutside of 3 standard deviations is supernatural.image [../Images/p203.jpg]The red area of the brain where the blue arrows are pointing in 6B(4) is theregion that surrounds the pineal gland as well as a region called Brodmann area30, which is associated with strong emotions and the formation of new memories.Our team sees this pattern in those areas of the brain repeatedly when studentsproduce gamma brain waves. Graphic 6B(5) is a three-dimensional picture of thesame student’s brain from below, showing a significant amount of energy comingfrom inside the limbic brain.image [../Images/p204.jpg]image [../Images/p205.jpg]image [../Images/p206.jpg]Graphics 7A(1) through 7A(5) show Felicia’s brain transitioning from normal betato high beta before she moves into a high-energy gamma state. (The blue arrowshows the transition.) The energy in gamma is 190 standard deviations abovenormal as she connects to the unified field. The area of the pineal gland aswell as the part of the brain that processes strong emotion is highly activated,as seen in 7B. The image in 7C is the underside of the brain. The red regiondemonstrates that energy in gamma is coming from inside the limbic brain. Take alook at Graphic 7D to see the changes in Felicia’s skin condition the followingday after she received a biological upgrade from the unified field.image [../Images/p207.jpg]The first scan represents the measurement of a person’s brain before sheactivates her heart center. The brain is in a dominant frequency ofdesynchronized beta brain waves, indicating a busy and distracted brain. Thesecond scan measures the same brain about 10 seconds later as she moves intoheart coherence. The entire brain goes into a coherent alpha brain wave state.image [../Images/p208.jpg]image [../Images/p209.jpg]Graphic 9A(1) shows a brain scan of a student who is in coherent alpha brainwaves while watching the kaleidoscope. Graphic 9A(2) illustrates a person incoherent theta brain wave states viewing the kaleidoscope in trance. Graphic9A(3) shows a three-dimensional image of the brain (nearly all in red) ofanother student, indicating almost the whole brain in a theta state. The redoval on the right shows the brain is being measured in theta. Graphic 9A(4)shows the brain scan of a student at different brain wave frequencies watchingthe kaleidoscope. The red and orange areas marked with the blue arrows on theright of each brain show a strong amount of activity in delta, theta, alpha, andbeta brain waves.image [../Images/p210.jpg]This is a brain that is fully engaged in the Mind Movie experience. There is asignificant amount of coherent high beta and gamma brain waves activating theentire brain.image [../Images/p211.jpg]When this person dimensionalized a scene in her Mind Movie during a meditation,she reported that she had a full-on sensory experience without her physicalsenses. In Graphic 11A you can see her brain is in coherent high beta and gamma.The energy in her brain is about 230 standard deviations above normal. The redarrow in Graphic 11B shows there is quite a bit of energy in high beta as shemoves into gamma. The blue arrows indicate that there is a lot of coherence inthe brain as well. It is important to note that she cannot make her brain dothis. The experience is happening to her.image [../Images/p212.jpg]Graphic 12A shows a baseline measurement of a person with normal beta and alphabrain waves before his walking meditation. If you review his post-scan inGraphic 12B, an hour and twenty minutes later, you’ll see he changed his brainto a high-energy gamma state.image [../Images/p213.jpg]Fractal patterns in the form of complex geometric configurations are standingwaves of frequency and information that can be de-scrambled by the brain intovery powerful imagery. Although these images are two-dimensional, they give youan idea of how the patterns appear.image [../Images/p214.jpg]For the years 1749 to 1926, Alexander Chizhevsky compared the annual number ofimportant political and social events with increased solar activity. On thegraph, the blue line illustrates sun flares and the red line relates to humanexcitability. Notice that every time there is high solar activity, there is acorrelation with heightened human events.Created from data provided in the translation of Alexander Chizhevsky’s paper“Physical factors of the historical process.”image [../Images/p215.jpg]Graphics 15A and 15B demonstrate an increase in the collective energy of theroom over 3 days in our advanced workshops. The first line, in red, is ourbaseline measurement and shows the room’s energy before the start of the eventon Wednesday. As you look at the red, blue, green, and brown lines (each colorrepresenting a different day), you’ll see that each day the energy steadilyincreases.image [../Images/p216.jpg]In Graphics 15C and 15D, the same color scale applies; however, thesemeasurements reflect specific time intervals during each day’s morningmeditations. Graphic 15D has an extra green line because we measured the energyof the room during the 4 A.M. pineal gland meditation. As you can see, theenergy was very high that morning.image [../Images/p217.jpg]Compliments of the HeartMath Institute, the top HRV graph represents incoherentheart rhythms as a result of feeling emotions like resentment, impatience, andfrustration. The bottom HRV graph represents coherent heart rhythms as a resultof feeling emotions like gratitude, appreciation, and kindness.When our HRV is in a heart-coherent pattern, it reflects increasedsynchronization and harmony within the two branches of the ANS, as well as inthe activity occurring in our higher-level brain centers. So much of what we’velearned from Western medicine has caused us to believe that we cannot controlour body’s autonomic nervous system (like heart rate and blood pressure) becausesuch functions are beyond the domain of the conscious mind, not to mention theseparation between the voluntary and involuntary nervous systems. We now know,however, that you don’t have to be a yogi or a mystic to be able to master suchskills. You just have to be supernatural, which can be learned. This is onereason why HMI teaches the importance of heart coherence not only toindividuals, but also to the military, law enforcement, schools, athletes, andother high-functioning individuals—so people can maintain clarity,decision-making ability, and composure in high-stress situations.The Benefits of Heart CoherenceWhen we choose to cultivate and experience elevated emotions and the coherentsignal of those elevated emotions reaches the brain, if the amplitude of thesignal is high enough, chemicals equal to those feelings and emotions arereleased into the body. We call this a feeling, and positive feelings like thismake us feel lighter and freer—in other words, the energy of your whole state ofbeing is elevated. If you are feeling an elevated sense of well-being in a safeenvironment, the energy of those feelings sets in motion a cascade of at least1,400 biochemical changes in the body that promote growth and repair.16[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt16] Instead of drawing from the invisible field ofenergy around your body to transform energy into chemistry, now you’re adding toand expanding that field, resulting in a new expression of chemistry reflectiveof the change in energy. How? If the first three energy centers of the body areenergy consumers when we are out of balance, the heart is an energy expander,and when you rest your attention in your heart to create and sustain elevatedemotions, that coherent energy causes your heart to beat like a drum. It’s thatcoherent, rhythmic beating that creates a measurable magnetic field around yourheart, and thus your body. Just like the focused beat of a drum that produces ameasurable sound wave, the stronger the coherent rhythm of the heart, the moreexpanded your field becomes.When you are feeling hurt, anger, stress, jealousy, rage, competition, orfrustration, on the other hand, the signal from the heart to the brain becomesincoherent, and this triggers the release of approximately 1,200 chemicals intothe body equal to those feelings.17 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt17] Thischemical dump lasts approximately 90 seconds to two minutes. In the short term,these stressful feelings are not harmful; in fact, if they’re resolved theyimprove your resilience. However, the long-term effects of unresolved survivalemotions put the entire body into a state of incoherence, making you vulnerableto stress-related health challenges. These survival emotions draw from the fieldaround your body, causing you to feel separate and materialistic because you areputting most of your focus and attention on matter, your body, the environment,time, and of course, the source of your problems.Among HMI’s most significant findings is that what we feel on aminute-to-minute, second-to-second basis influences the heart, and that ourfeelings and emotions are a key aspect of unlocking “heart intelligence.”Because feelings and emotions are energies that emit powerful magnetic fields,the stronger the elevated feelings, the stronger the magnetic field. In fact,the heart produces the strongest magnetic field in the body—five thousand timesgreater in strength than the field produced by the brain.18[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt18]Place your finger on your wrist and feel your pulse. That pulse is a wave ofenergy called the blood pressure wave and it travels through your entire body,influencing everything, including brain function. Not only does the heart’smagnetic pulse reverberate through every cell of the body, but it also producesa field around your body that can be measured up to 8 to 10 feet away using asensitive detector called a magnetometer.19 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt19]When you activate the heart by calling up elevated emotions, you are not onlybroadcasting that energy to every cell; you are also radiating those feelingsout into space. This is where the heart moves beyond biology and into physics.Using electroencephalograms, scientists at the HMI laboratory discovered thatwhen the heart goes into coherence, the brain waves entrain with the heart’srhythm at a frequency of 0.10 Hz and also that the synchronization between heartand brain is increased when the subject is in a heart-coherent state. Thecoherent frequency of 0.10 Hz has been shown to be a state of optimumperformance associated with increased access to our deeper intuition andinternal guidance. Once the analytical mind is out of the way, the individualcan move down the ladder of consciousness from alpha to theta to delta brainwaves—the state in which restorative functions in the body take place.Coincidentally, we often see our students reporting profound or mysticalexperiences in deep delta around .09 to .10 Hz (.09 Hz is just a hundredth of acycle per second off reported optimum coherence) while their hearts are in avery coherent state. However, the amplitude of energy produced by the heartincreases the level of energy in the brain, in some cases more than 50 to 300times the normal level or more.Supporting evidence of heart-brain coherence was further demonstrated by aseries of experiments performed by Gary Schwartz, Ph.D., and his colleagues atthe University of Arizona. In their experiments, they found inexplicablecommunications between the heart and the brain that made no sense vianeurological or other established communication pathways. This discoveryestablished the fact that energetic interactions between the heart and the brainexist through electromagnetic fields.20 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt20] Bothexamples point to the fact that when we focus our attention on our heart andemotions, the heart’s beating acts as an amplifier. This increases thesynchronization between our heart and brain and creates coherence not only inthe physical organs, but also in the electromagnetic field surrounding our body.Also noteworthy is that right behind the breastbone sits a small gland calledthe thymus, which has an intimate connection with the heart center. As one ofthe main organs of the immune system, the thymus serves a vital role in thepromotion of T cells, which defend the body from pathogens such as bacteria andviruses. The thymus gland functions optimally up to the onset of puberty, but itbegins to shrink as we get older because of natural decreases in the productionof human growth hormone.As with many vital organs, the thymus is also prone to the negative effects oflong-term stress. When we’re living in emergency mode for extended periods oftime and diminish our vital energy field, all of our energy is directed outwardto protect us from external threats, leaving little energy to protect us frominternal threats. Eventually, this leads to dysfunction of the immune system. Itmakes sense, then, that as the heart center becomes activated with energy, bymobilizing the parasympathetic nervous system for growth and repair, the thymusgland should become more active as well, because now we’re adding energy in thatgland. Therefore, the thymus gland should also benefit from the practice ofsustaining coherence within the body, aiding in the support of the overallvitality of our immune system and long-term health.You learned earlier in this book that in my own independent studies, when ourstudents were able to feel and sustain gratitude and other elevated emotions fora total of 15 to 20 minutes per day for four days, the energy of the emotionssignaled the immune cell genes to make a protein called immunoglobulin A. Thesignificant increase in IgA is a perfect example of one of the many positivecascading effects of heart coherence.What all of this boils down to is that the quality of our heart’s rhythm hasconsequences for our overall health. If the heart beats in harmonious rhythms,its efficiency reduces stress on other systems of the body, maximizes ourenergy, and creates states whereby we thrive mentally, emotionally, andphysically. If there is disharmony in our heart rhythms, the opposite is true.This incoherence leaves us with less energy available for healing and formaintaining health and long-term building projects, creating unrest within ourinternal states and putting increased stress on the heart and other organs.21[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt21] Heart attacks and heart disease, for example,occur when the body has been under stress for extended periods of time. When weintentionally choose elevated emotions, however, focusing less on disharmony andmore on gratitude, our bodies respond positively and we enjoy improved health.The next time you use an elevated emotion to tune in to your future and embracethose feelings before the event unfolds—and feel gratitude that the event hasalready occurred—just know that the worst thing that probably can happen to youis that you begin to heal.The Effects of Chronic StressWhen we live in a constant state of stress, our heart center becomes incoherentand this stifles our ability to create. In response to chaotic heart rhythms,the brain becomes very dis-integrated and incoherent, and that incoherence isreflected in the two branches of the ANS. If the parasympathetic system is thebrake and the sympathetic system is the accelerator, when they are working inopposition, your body is receiving a message akin to stepping on the gas whileyour foot is on the brake. It doesn’t take a significant amount of automotiveknowledge to understand the ramifications of these opposing forces—we wear outthe brakes and put stress on the drivetrain, while the resistance wastes energyand reduces fuel efficiency. Eventually, this habituation of stress wears downthe body so much that it eliminates our ability to repair and maintain health,depleting our vitality and resilience.If resilience is based on efficient energy management, you may feel completelydrained, out of sorts, and perhaps sick while under the influence of chronicstress. The more addicted we become to these states of stress, the less likelywe are to open our hearts, go within, and consciously create heart coherence.An experience I had at my home in a rural area of Washington State serves as agood example. One November evening I came home from work, parked my car as Ialways did, and began walking down the 40-yard path to my house. It was pitchblack. About 30 yards from my front door, off to my right, I heard an ominousgrowl coming from behind some very large rocks. Immediately, I narrowed my focuson matter (some thing) and found myself thinking, What could be lurking in thedarkness? I began searching in my mind and then my environment for knowns frommy past memory bank in order to predict my future. Could it be one of my dogs? Iwondered. I started calling out their names, but there was no response. As Itook a few more steps, the growling became louder.Without my having to think about mobilizing the energy in my body, the hair onthe back of my neck stood up, my heart rate and respiratory rate increased, andmy senses became heightened in preparation for fight or flight. I took out mycell phone and turned on the flashlight to narrow my focus on the possiblethreat, but I still couldn’t see what was making the noise. From the darkness,the growling continued. I slowly backed up and finally fled to my barn, where myranch hands were putting away the horses for the night. We grabbed our guns andflashlights and returned to the scene just in time to see a cougar and her cubscurrying away through the bushes.You can probably gather from this story that a highly stressful situation likethis is not the time to open your heart or trust in the unknown. It’s not a timeto take your attention off things in your outer material world to focus on a newpossibility in your mind. It’s a time to run, hide, or fight. But if you areperpetually hooked into the fight-or-flight state—even if there is no cougar inthe bushes—you will be less likely to want to close your eyes and go withinbecause you have to keep your attention on the perceived threat outside of you.No new information can enter your nervous system that is not equal to orrelevant to the emotions you are experiencing, so you can’t program your bodyfor a new destiny. So it makes sense that the more you live addicted to thestress hormones in your normal life, the less likely you are to want to create,meditate, or open your heart and be vulnerable.The “Heart-Brain”In 1991, the pioneering work of J. Andrew Armour, M.D., Ph.D., showed that theheart literally has a mind of its own. With as many as 40,000 neurons, the hearthas a nervous system that functions independently of the brain. The technicalterm coined for this system is the intrinsic cardiac nervous system, morecommonly known as the “heart-brain.”22 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt22] Thisdiscovery was so monumental that it led to a new field of science calledneurocardiology.image [../Images/p223.jpg]When the heart moves into coherence, it acts as an amplifier, sending coherentinformation through its afferent nervous pathways straight to the thalamus,which synchronizes the neocortex and the brain’s survival centers.The heart and the brain are connected by efferent (descending) and afferent(ascending) pathways; however, 90 percent of the connecting nerve fibers ascendfrom the heart up to the brain.23 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt23] Armouruncovered that these direct, afferent neural pathways continuously send signalsand information that interacts with and modifies activity in the brain’s highercognitive and emotional centers.24 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt24] Thesesignals from the heart to the brain connect through the vagus nerve and continuestraight to the thalamus (which synchronizes cortical activity such as thinking,perceiving, and understanding language), then to the frontal lobes (responsiblefor motor functions and problem solving), and on to the brain’s survival center,the amygdala (which signals emotional memory). The core cells of the amygdalaeven synchronize to the heart’s beating.25 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt25](See Figure 7.2.) This means that if your heart center is open, it’s keepingyour brain’s survival centers in check. It’s possible, then, that the more heartcentered you are, the less likely you will react to stressors in your life. Thereverse is also true: the less energy you have in your heart center, the morelikely you will be living in survival mode.This tells us that our feelings and heart rhythms affect what emotional memoriesand responses transpire in us, so stress and anxiety can trigger brain-wavepatterns to match an anxiety habit of the past. Conversely, just like a computerthat matches patterns, elevated emotions of the heart can produce coherence inbrain-wave patterns, so if you’re summoning the feelings of your future bycreating elevated states, your brain is beginning to lay the neural networks forthose future emotions or that new destiny. Armour’s discovery of the afferentneural pathways from the heart to the brain proves that the heart independentlyprocesses emotions, responds directly to the environment, and regulates itsrhythms—without receiving information from the brain. That’s because the heartand the ANS always work together. Also noteworthy is that the nervesfacilitating this communication enable the heart to sense, remember,self-regulate, and make decisions about cardiac control independent of thenervous system.26 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt26]To put it simply, emotions and feelings originating in the heart play animportant role in the way we think, process information, feel, and understandthe world and our place in it.27 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch7_nt27] Once theheart center is activated, it acts as an amplifier to jump-start the brain,enhance its activity, and create balance, order, and coherence throughout thebody.Living Heart CenteredAs I said earlier, every thought you think produces corresponding chemistryequal to that thought, which in turn creates an emotion. Therefore, you aresuggestible only to the thoughts equal to your emotional state. We now know thatwhen our students are heart centered and feel more wholeness and oneness,they’re less separate from their dreams. When they feel gratitude, abundance,freedom, or love, all of those emotions welcome corresponding thoughts. Thoseheart-centered emotions open the door to the subconscious mind so that you canprogram your autonomic nervous system equal to the thoughts of your new future.We also know that if they live in the feeling of fear or lack but try to thinkthey’re abundant, they can’t produce a measurable effect, because change canonly happen when thoughts are in alignment with the emotional state of the body.They can think positively all they want, but without a corresponding feeling oremotion equal to that thought, the message cannot be felt or understoodthroughout the rest of the body.So you could repeat the affirmation I am fearless until you’re blue in the face,but if it’s fear you’re actually feeling, the thought I am fearless never makesit past the brain stem, which means you’re not signaling the body and ANS into anew, specific destiny. The feeling is what produces the emotional charge(energy) to stimulate your ANS into a different destiny. Without the feeling, adisconnect remains between your brain and body—between the thought of health andthe feeling of health—and you can’t embody that new state of being.It’s only when you change your energy that you can produce more consistenteffects. If you sustain these elevated emotions on a daily basis, eventuallyyour body, in its innate intelligence, begins to make relative genetic changesin the way I described earlier. That’s because the body believes that theemotion you are embracing is coming from an experience in your environment. Sowhen you open your heart center, practice feeling an emotion before theexperience occurs, and marry it with a clear intention, the body responds as ifit’s in the future experience. That heart-mind coherence then influences yourbody chemistry and energy in a series of ways.If coherence between the heart and the brain can originate in the heart, andtheir synchronization results in optimal performance and health, then you shouldbe taking time every day to focus on activating your heart center. Byintentionally choosing to feel the elevated emotions of the heart rather thanwaiting for something outside of yourself to elicit those emotions, you becomewho you are truly meant to be—a heart-empowered individual. When you are livingby the heart, you naturally choose love and innately demonstrate it throughcompassion and care for the well-being of yourself, others, and planet Earth.Through our partnership with HMI, our students have demonstrated that withpractice, we can in fact produce, regulate, and sustain elevated feelings andemotions—independent of events in our external world.In our workshops around the world, through the practice of regulating heartrhythms to sustain elevated emotions, we teach our students how to generateheart and brain coherence. We then measure their abilities using HRV monitors.During guided meditations, we ask our students to surrender to the feelings ofgratitude, joy, and love, and we encourage daily practice outside of our formalinstruction, because when one chooses to practice sitting in a state ofcoherence, it becomes a habit. I hope that with enough practice, our studentscan replace old mental scripts of feeling unworthy, fearful, or insecure withmore elevated states of being and fall deeply in love with their lives. We’veseen enough of them demonstrate that it is indeed possible to produce positive,measurable, tangible effects in their lives simply by shifting the paradigm oftheir thoughts and feelings. These dedicated individuals return to their homes,where the positive effects they’ve produced in their own lives ripple out topositively affect their families and communities, continuously expanding theirvibrational influence of harmony and coherence throughout the world.By repeatedly practicing the regulation of heightened emotional states, in timethe constant feeling of elevated emotions creates a new emotional baseline. Thisbaseline then begins to continuously influence a new set of thoughts equal tothe heightened feelings. The summation of those novel thoughts creates a newlevel of mind, which then produces more corresponding emotions equal to thosethoughts, further sustaining that baseline. When this feedback loop between theheart (body) and mind (brain) occurs, you are in an entirely new state ofbeing—the consciousness of the unlimited mind and the energy of profound loveand gratitude. The repetition of this process is what it means to reconditionyour body, rewire your brain, and reconfigure your biology equal to your newstate of being. Now you are naturally, automatically, and regularly broadcastinga different electromagnetic signature of energy into the field. This is who youare, or who you have become.Countless history books could be written through the lens of incoherentemotions. Whether the result is a Shakespearean tragedy, genocide, or a worldwar, survival emotions such as blame, hate, rage, competition, and retributionhave resulted in an endless, unnecessary trail of pain, suffering, oppression,and death. The results have caused humans to live in opposition and conflictrather than in peace and harmony. This is a time in history when we can breakthat cycle. This is a pivotal moment in the story of humanity where ancientwisdom and modern science are intersecting to provide us with the technology andscientific understanding to learn not only how to more efficiently andeffectively manage our emotions, but also what that means for our health,relationships, energy levels, and personal and collective evolution. It doesn’trequire moving mountains—only changing our internal state of being. This allowsus to alter the way we act with one another, replacing stressful situations withpositive experiences that give us energy, fill our spirit, and leave us with asense of wholeness, connection, and unity. The brain may think, but when youturn your heart into an instrument of perception, it knows.Examples from Our WorkshopsTo see an example of how heart coherence creates brain coherence, take a look atGraphics 8A and 8B in the color insert. The first image shows relativelylow-normal beta brain-wave patterns before the person begins to create heartcoherence. The second image shows a significant change once the person movesinto sustained heart coherence just a few seconds later. That’s because theheart acts as an amplifier to influence the brain to create very coherentsynchronized alpha brain waves.In Figures 7.3A and 7.3B you will see an HRV analysis from one of our studentstaken at an advanced workshop. She’s having a pretty amazing day. The firstchart, in Figure 7.3A, represents two meditations, one in the morning and oneright before lunch, and each block represents five minutes of elapsed time.Where you see the first gray arrow on the top of the scan pointing down to theright is when she went into (and sustained) heart coherence. During our 7 A.M.meditation, she maintained this state for more than 50 minutes, until you seethe second arrow pointing down to the left. At the bottom of the scan, where yousee the second gray arrow pointing down to the right, is when she again wentinto heart coherence for 38 minutes during a meditation just before lunch,ending with the second gray arrow pointing down to the left. You can see she isdeveloping the skill.image [../Images/p228.jpg]Each set of gray arrows pointing inward in both figures represent a studentgoing into heart coherence by sustaining an elevated emotional state. Everysquare block represents a five-minute time interval. From both Figures 7.3A and7.3B, you can tell she’s developing the skill to regulate her internal states.In Figure 7.3B, at the bottom where the two arrows are pointing inward, thestudent spontaneously goes into heart coherence for over an hour. Her body isbeing conditioned to a new mind.Now look at Figure 7.3B. In the next meditation later that afternoon, if youglance between the two gray arrows at the top of the figure, you can see thatshe goes into heart coherence again for almost 45 minutes. What makes thisreading so fascinating, however, is what happens later that evening around 8P.M. (see the second set of gray arrows pointing inward). Since there was nomeditation taking place at the time, we asked her later what she hadexperienced. Her heart went into “super coherence” for more than hour while shewas in her normal level of wakefulness.She told us she’d been getting ready for bed when suddenly she felt anoverwhelming feeling of love. It was so strong that she had to lie down andsurrender to it. Her heart spontaneously went into heart coherence, and for anhour and 10 minutes while she lay on her bed, she fell deeply in love with herlife. She sustained a change in her ANS. Where you see the last arrow is whereshe said she rolled over on her side and fell asleep. Not a bad way to end aday, wouldn’t you agree?image [../Images/p229.jpg]An example of three students sustaining heart-centered emotions for 45 minutes.So ponder this: You know how easy it is to think a fearful or anxious thoughtabout a future event that hasn’t happened—and in your mind emotionally embracethis fictional outcome over and over? And you know how the more energy you feedthe thought, the more you ruminate over other possible outcomes, and eventuallythose thoughts deliver you to a worst-case scenario? It’s the emotions that aredriving those thoughts. You’ve conditioned your body to be the mind in fear andanxiety. If this continues over a long period of time, your body may have apanic attack—an autonomic, spontaneous bodily function that your conscious mindcan’t control.But what if instead of conditioning the body to the mind of fear and anxiety,you experienced sustained elevated emotions and conditioned your body to themind of love and coherence? Instead of being afraid and dreading that a panicattack is going to happen again, you’d get excited and look forward to theprospect of having an autonomic love attack.Figure 7.4 shows three more examples of students who are able to sustain heartcoherence for extended periods of time. If you look closely, you’ll see theirhearts are all responding to a consistent state of elevated emotions for atleast 45 minutes—that is, their bodies are responding to a new mind. I’d saythat’s pretty supernatural.Figures 7.5A and 7.5B demonstrate two examples of people with very poor heartrate variability (noted with two sets of black arrows pointing upward) in thenatural waking state. Take a look at the changes in heart rate variability whenthey practice heart coherence shown in the area between the gray arrows pointinginward. Even if it is only for 8 to 15 minutes, these students are changingtheir biology.Heart Coherence MeditationThis meditation is based on the Heart Lock-In Technique developed by HMI. Closeyour eyes, allow your body to relax, and bring your attention to your heart.Start breathing in and out from the heart center, and continue to do this moreslowly and deeply. When your mind wanders, keep returning your attention andawareness to your chest, your heart, and your breath.Next, while you rest your attention in your fourth center, bring up someelevated emotions while continuing to breathe in and out of your heart center.Once you feel these heartfelt emotions in your chest area, send that energy outbeyond your body and marry it with your intention. Continue to broadcast thatenergy and intention all around you. Start with 10 minutes and try to extend thetime you practice every day.image [../Images/p231.jpg]In both figures, you can see two different students who have very little heartrate variability (demonstrated by the black arrows pointing upward). However,when it comes time to open their hearts, if you look between the two grayarrows, you will see a significant change. Even if it is just for 8 to 15minutes, they are changing their physiology.Eventually, when you come to know what it feels like in your body to experiencethese elevated emotions, you can practice throughout your day with your eyesopen (you’ll learn more about how to do this in Chapter 9[../Text/chapter09.xhtml], Walking Meditation). You might even set a reminder onyour phone for four times a day, and when it goes off, take a minute or two tofeel those elevated emotions."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 8 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t8]image [../Images/line.jpg]MIND MOVIES/KALEIDOSCOPE [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t8]image [../Images/line.jpg]I had just finished a keynote lecture on a Saturday night in Orlando, Florida.The following morning, while packing my bags in preparation for my afternoonflight home, I turned on the television to catch up on the political situationin the United States. It was in the thick of the 2016 presidential election, andsince I had been out of the country traveling and lecturing over the previousthree weeks, I was curious about what had transpired during my time away. Iquickly surfed through the channels to find a news station, set the remote down,and while halfway paying attention to the TV, continued packing. Suddenly, acommercial came on that caught all my attention, and in an instant I understoodwhy we call television programming.The commercial began with a nighttime exterior shot of a couple’s home. As thecamera zooms in on the house, the words “Night #14 with Shingles” appear on thescreen. When the shot moves to the interior, tender yet foreboding music playswhile an elderly man moans in pain at the foot of his bed. His concerned wifeenters the room and asks him how he’s doing. “It hurts,” he replies. In thelower right corner in a tiny font almost the same color as the background arethe words “Actor Portrayal.”The wife walks over with a look of despair and slowly lifts her husband’s shirt,revealing huge, red-scabbed lesions covering more than half his lower back. Theimagery is shocking, grotesque, and horrific, looking like nothing less than alarge third-degree burn. In my 31 years of practice, I’ve examined hundreds ofpeople with shingles and have never seen anything that looked so severe as themanufactured lesions in this commercial. I immediately knew it was designed toevoke a strong emotional response with the viewing audience—because it certainlydid in me.Once you see the rash on the man’s back, the commercial achieves its goal ofcommanding your attention. Because the portrayal of the rash is so arresting, itchanges the way you were feeling from only a few moments before your presentstate of watching it. The moment the commercial significantly changes yourinternal emotional state, it causes you to put more of your attention andawareness on the source of the disruption in your external environment. Thestronger the emotion it causes (stimulus), the more you lean in and payattention (response). This association of stimulus and response, orconditioning, is how long-term, or associative, memories are created.This process of conditioning begins by pairing a symbol or an image with achange in an emotional state—a combination that opens the doorway between theconscious and subconscious mind. In the case of the shingles commercial, nowthat they have captured all your attention (and begun the programming process),you can’t help but naturally wonder what they’re about to say next. Thecommercial continues with a somber male narrator: “If you’ve ever had chickenpox, the shingles virus is already inside of you. As you get older, your immunesystem weakens and it loses its ability to keep the shingles virus in check.” Byusing emotional branding, this is the first instance where the commercial raisesethical questions by telling the audience that the immune system weakens withage. Next, we see the man in the bathroom looking at himself in the mirror. Helooks worried, broken, and defeated.The scene changes to his wife talking on the phone in the kitchen. “I just can’tstand seeing him like this,” she says.Next, we see the man doubled over on his bed, palm to forehead, wincing in pain.The narrator then makes a direct suggestion, reinforced by the same wordsappearing on the screen: “1 in 3 people will get shingles in their lifetime.”The narrator continues while the same words remain on the screen. “The shinglesrash can last up to 30 days.”The scene cuts to his wife pleading directly into the camera: “I just wish therewas something I could do to help.”Again, we see the man in pain, and on the screen appear the words: “1 in 5people with shingles will have long-term nerve pain.” These words remain on thescreen for the remaining narration, which says, “Some people with shingles willhave long-term nerve pain, which can last a few months to a few years. Don’twait until someone you love develops shingles. Talk to your doctor or pharmacistabout your risk.”Let’s take a closer look at what this commercial is attempting to do. First, itputs you in an emotional state by changing how you feel. Once it captures yourattention, you immediately become more open and suggestible to the informationthat follows. Now that you’re more prone to accept, believe, and surrender tothis information (without analyzing it), if you’re feeling fearful, victimized,vulnerable, worried, shocked, weak, tired, or in pain, you’re more susceptibleto the information equal to those emotions. You might start wondering if theailment could happen to you.At various points during the commercial, certain “facts” appear written on thescreen, allowing you to read along. This serves to reinforce the programming.Also, while the thinking brain is focused on reading the copy, the content ofthe narration slips behind the conscious mind and into the subconscious mind.Like an audio recorder, it records the entire script and creates an internalprogram.Next, through a direct, literal suggestion, the narrator has instilled fear inyou by personally suggesting you already have the shingles virus in your bodyand that because of the natural process of aging, your immune system is nolonger strong enough to take care of the virus. This turns on your emotionalbrain (the seat of your autonomic nervous system), allowing it to becomeprogrammed. Once the suggestions make it to your autonomic nervous system, ittakes the orders without question and gets busy making chemical changes in yourbody equal to the literal suggestions. In other words, your body is going tosubconsciously and automatically be programmed to weaken your immune function.In conclusion, you’re at risk and you’d better not wait until you contract it.The commercial’s effect goes even a little further: if you’ve ever had chickenpox and after watching this you “think” your immune system is weak because ofyour age, you will decide you have an even greater need to prevent gettingshingles, so you will be even more motivated to buy the drug.If you happen to be a person who has shingles and you’re watching thiscommercial, when you see that your condition is not as severe as the actor’sshingles, you may find yourself thinking, I should take the drug now so that itdoesn’t get any worse. I don’t want to end up like him. If you don’t haveshingles, at the commercial’s end you may still be left quietly wondering, Am Ipart of the two-thirds of the population that is safe? Or am I in the one-thirdof the population that will get the virus? If you think, I hope I’m not part ofthe one-third, it means you believe there may be a chance that you’resusceptible and vulnerable, leaving you unconsciously thinking that you alreadyhave it.You know what I found most absurd about this commercial? They never even mentionthe drug, which means they don’t have to reveal its side effects. Since thecommercial had now piqued my curiosity, I stopped packing and looked on theInternet for another commercial by the same pharmaceutical company. I wanted toknow what drug they were suggesting would alleviate the severity of the actor’sexaggerated, manufactured lesions. After a quick search, I found several similarcommercials with the same theme and wording but with slight variations. They allshared one thing in common, however; they were all designed to capture yourattention.In the next commercial I watched, a woman is wearing goggles and swimming in alap pool. Everything is black and white. In a twist on the previous commercial,the narrator (speaking in an authoritative female British accent) is theshingles virus and the narration is coming from within the woman’s head:“Impressive, Linda. Age isn’t slowing you down, but your immune system weakensas you get older, increasing the risk for me—the shingles virus. I’ve beenlurking inside you since you had chicken pox. I could surface at any time as apainful blistering rash.” The scene then abruptly cuts from black and white tocolor and a man lifts his shirt to reveal the worst shingles rash you’ve everseen. Again, the grotesque, blistering lesion can’t help but attract yourattention. As quickly as the scene turns to color, it returns to the swimmer inblack and white.The commercial continues in a similar manner and formula as the previous one:First make an arresting statement or show a shocking image to change theviewer’s emotional state, then cause them to be more suggestible to theinformation via the change in their emotional state, and finally useautosuggestion to make them wonder if they already have shingles. This ad alsoinfers that even though you might be healthy, work out, and take care ofyourself, you can still become a victim of the virus, further suggesting that noone is immune. Again, the words on the screen reinforce the message: “1 in 3people get me in their lifetime. Linda, will it be you?” If you identify withthe woman in any manner, the voice is talking directly to you.The tone of the commercial then changes as a new male narrator begins speakingin a confident, lighthearted tone, devoid of worry or concern. In a similarBritish accent, the voice says, “And that’s why Linda got me—Drug X.” The sceneremains in black and white except for the woman’s bathing suit, her swim cap,and the name of the drug, which appears on the screen in a large, sophisticatedfont. Now the drug has been imprinted into your brain at yet another level. Onceagain, the ad has created an association between your health and safety and thedrug that will protect you. The tagline comes on the screen as the narratorreads it aloud, stating that the drug helps “to boost your immune system againstshingles. To help protect her against you, shingles.”At the end of the commercial, that narrator says, “Drug X is used to preventshingles in adults fifty years and older. The drug is not to be used to treatshingles, and it does not help everyone.” Here’s the punch line: “You should nottake the drug if you have a weakened immune system.”Whoa—what? Back up. Here’s the irony: They just told you that as you age, yourimmune system weakens and you’re at a greater risk for shingles. The drug issupposed to strengthen your immune system, but you shouldn’t use it if you havea weakened immune system. Now comes the dilemma: If you still choose to take thedrug, you believe the drug to be more powerful than your possibly weakenedimmune system. The programming worked.What the clever, if not unethical, advertisers understand is that this messageis confusing and disorienting to your conscious mind. At the same time, however,they are programming your subconscious mind with the idea that your immunesystem is weak, you probably already have the virus within you, and chances arehigh that you’ll get shingles, even if you are healthy. In addition, you aretold that without the medication, you are likely to suffer—even though there isno guarantee that the shingles will go away easily—and that it still might notwork if your immune system is weak.Finally come the side effects (which are not side effects, but direct effects):“A shingles-like rash, redness, pain, itching, swelling, hard lumps, warmth,bruising or swelling at the injection site, and headache. Talk to your doctor ifyou plan to be around newborns or people who are pregnant or have a weakenedimmune system because the vaccine has a weakened version of the chickenpox virusand you could infect them.”Wow! I started to wonder what planet I was living on. This type of programmingmakes you wonder if we really have free will or if we’re all making choicesbased on what we have been conditioned to believe is the answer, whether that’sa certain type of beer, shampoo or conditioner, the latest smartphone, or a pillthat may or may not provide relief from the shingles virus you may or may noteven have. Most of the time advertising appeals to lack and separation byreminding you to want what you don’t have, desire what you need to fit into asocial consciousness, or satiate a feeling of emptiness or loneliness. And ofcourse, in this case, if you’re sick or feeling like you’re sick, the advertiserhas the answer to your symptoms.In one final search, I came across a similar commercial with the same theme—anactor dramatically suffering for 17 days, the shocking exposure of a hugelesion, and words on the screen to influence the viewer’s thoughts whilereinforcing the same content. Like the other commercials, this one explicitlyinforms the public that the drug is not used to treat shingles, but at the endof the commercial the handsome man smiles and declares, “I think I’m going togive it a try.” Meanwhile, I’m left wondering why he would give it a try if healready has had shingles for 17 days, especially if the drug doesn’t treat thecondition. Now I’m really confused.Years ago, I learned in my training that by definition, hypnosis is adisorientation of the inhibitory processes of the conscious mind, bypassing theanalytical mind so that one becomes highly responsive to suggestions andinformation in the subconscious mind. As the conscious mind is busy andpreoccupied trying to figure things out, the subconscious mind takes it all inwithout discretion. If you can disorient people with information (or in today’sworld, disinformation), shock, or confusion, you just opened the door toprogramming their subconscious mind.In this chapter, we’re going to learn how to do the opposite and positivelyreprogram the negative programming we’ve been conditioned to for most of ourlives.Three Minds in One Brain: The Conscious, Subconscious, and Analytical MindBy now, you know that when you change your brain waves from beta to alpha, youslow down your neocortex (the analytical, thinking brain). As your brain wavesslow down, you leave the domain of the conscious mind and enter the realm of thesubconscious mind. We could say, then, that if you are somewhat conscious andaware but not actively engaged in thought, your consciousness is moving out ofthe thinking neocortex and entering the midbrain, otherwise known as thesubconscious, the home to the autonomic nervous system and the cerebellum.If you’ve ever witnessed someone completely captivated by a television show, somuch so that when you tried to speak to them they didn’t hear you, it’s possiblethat they were experiencing alpha brainwave states—a state highly suggestible toinformation. Suggestibility is the ability to accept, believe, and surrender toinformation without analyzing it. In this state, the viewer is so engrossed, sofocused on what they’re watching, that they appear entranced and motionless.Nothing else exists to them except the object of their attention.If the person doesn’t analyze the information they are being exposed to, theyare likely to accept, believe, and/or surrender to it because there is noanalytical filter. It makes logical sense, then, that the more suggestible youare, the less analytical you are. The opposite is also true: The more analyticalyou are, the less suggestible you are to information; therefore, it is lesslikely that your brain will be in an alpha brain-wave or trance state. Take alook at Figure 8.1 to help you understand the relationship betweensuggestibility, the analytical mind, trance, and brain waves.image [../Images/p239.jpg]As your brain waves slow down and you get beyond your analytical mind, yourbrain moves into trance and you’re more suggestible to information. The inverseis also true. As your brain waves speed up, you become more analytical, thebrain moves out of trance, and you become less suggestible to information.Suggestibility is your ability to accept, believe, and surrender to informationwithout analyzing it.What the creators of the commercials I mentioned earlier fully understand isthat the best way to program a person to take a desired action is to put theminto an alpha brain-wave state so that the information presented is notanalyzed. When the commercial is repeated, or a similar one with the samemessage is played over and over, sooner or later that program is going to enterthe viewer’s subconscious. The more we are exposed to the stimulus (in thiscase, the commercial), the more automatic the programmed response becomes.Eventually, when we’ve unconsciously memorized the stimulus and the response isautomatic, the conscious mind no longer needs to think about or analyze theincoming information. Meanwhile, the subconscious mind maps the information,recording and storing it like a voice or video recording. Once it is mapped inyour brain, each time you are exposed to the commercial, it continues to primethe same neural networks, further reinforcing the same program, thought, andbelief. Now, not only can information influence your health, but it can alsogive you the solution to the problem the commercial is actually creating.Other situations that increase suggestibility include shock, trauma, or a strongemotional reaction. For instance, when people are stunned or exposed toemotionally charged situations, it’s common that the brain goes into an alteredstate. As the brain pauses because of a sensory overload, such as a motorvehicle accident, the person enters a suggestible state. In severe cases, theperson surrenders to the shock, becomes frozen and numb, and their ability tothink becomes impaired. Therefore, when someone is exposed to an aggressive rashand feels sickened by the images (combined with the right music and narration tocreate an ominous or foreboding mood), the door to the subconscious mind opens,making the person more easily programmable.If you remember, the subconscious mind sits right below the conscious mind. Thelimbic brain is the home of the subconscious and the autonomic nervous system,which controls all the automatic biological functions that happen on amoment-to-moment basis. Once a thought is programmed, like a servant carryingout their master’s orders, the ANS carries out the request of the thought.If you are repeatedly told that your immune system weakens as you age, and thatone out of three people who have had chicken pox in their life will getshingles, the emotionally charged experience allows the message to make it pastyour thinking, analytical mind. In response to this information, your ANSfollows the orders and can begin to actually weaken your internal defensesystem.For the advertisers to really get their money’s worth in this commercialendeavor, it’s best for them to repeatedly run the commercials late in theevening when we are most suggestible to programming. Why? Because melatoninlevels rise in response to darkness, and melatonin causes our brain waves toslow down in preparation for sleeping and dreaming. Because our brain waves aremoving from beta, to alpha, to theta, to delta in the evening, people are lessanalytical and their subconscious window opens. As daylight wakes us up in themorning and our brain begins producing serotonin, the reverse process occurs;our brain waves go from delta, to theta, to alpha (where, again, oursubconscious is open to programming), and eventually to beta.So if you’re an advertiser and you know the majority of the public is not awareof the way subconscious programming works, why not create a series of late-nightcommercials with your desired messaging, accent it with just the right amount offright and concern so as to capture the viewer’s attention, and proceed toprogram their autonomic nervous system to get busy taking the orders just beforethey fall asleep?A good rule of thumb: Don’t watch anything on television or on the Internet orparticipate in any mode of entertainment that you don’t want to experience—notonly before bed, but ever.Kaleidoscope Eyes: Entranced in TranceFor years, I’ve been thinking about how we’re all constantly programmed intoself-limited beliefs; that is, believing that we need something outside of us tochange how we feel inside of us. This is, after all, what advertising is allabout—the never-ending dependence on, and consumption of, external sources tomake us feel happy or better. This belief, which reminds us of our separationfrom wholeness, is incessantly ingrained in us through the media, televisionshows, commercials, the news, video games, websites, and sometimes even music.It’s a simple strategy, really: If you can suspend people in the feelings oflack, fear, anger, opposition, prejudice, pain, sadness, and anxiety, theyremain dependent on someone or something outside of them to make those feelingsgo away. If you remain in a perpetual state of busyness, and are alwayspreoccupied in survival emotions, you never actually have the opportunity tobelieve in yourself.But what if it was possible to undo or reverse that programming so you hadunlimited beliefs about yourself and your life? That’s exactly what we’ve beendoing for several years at our advanced workshops using two simple tools,including one that children have been playing with for ages—a kaleidoscope. Theonly difference is that we’re applying it in a technologically advanced way toinduce trance.Up until this point, we’ve been moving into trance and alpha and thetabrain-wave states with our eyes closed during meditation. But if we can createalpha and even theta brain-wave states with our eyes open, and intentionallyexpose ourselves to information relevant to our life’s dreams and goals, we canreprogram ourselves into supernatural states rather than the unconscious stateswe experience daily. But why the kaleidoscope?For many years now, my primary passion has been the mystical. Each time I haveone of these profound and super-lucid experiences, they create lasting changeswithin me that deepen my understanding of myself and my connection to themystery of life. Once you have a mystical experience and get your first glancebehind the veil, you can never go back to business as usual, and with everysubsequent mystical experience you have, you move closer to source, wholeness,oneness, and the indivisible unified field. The good news is that mysticalexperiences are no longer relegated to people like Teresa of Avila, Francis ofAssisi, or a Buddhist monk who’s been meditating for 40 years. Every person iscapable of engaging, experiencing, and accessing the mystical.When I’m having a mystical experience, it seems more real to me than anything Ihave ever known in my life, and I lose track of space and time. Often, justbefore I become entwined in it, I see in my mind (and sometimes in my outerworld) circular, geometric patterns made of light and energy. They tend to looklike mandalas, except they’re not static; they’re standing waves of interferingfrequencies that appear as fractal patterns. The only way I can describe theirproperties is that they are alive, moving, changing, and ever evolving into morecomplex patterns within patterns.These patterns look like what you see when you look into a kaleidoscope, butinstead of being two-dimensional, they are three-dimensional. When I see andrest my attention on these divine geometric patterns, they change, and I know ina moment—as my brain takes that pattern of information and transduces it intovivid imagery—I am about to have a profound mystical experience. That’s why myteam and I wanted to create a kaleidoscope visual for my students—to hopefullyinduce those types of experiences. But we couldn’t find any real footage of akaleidoscope. At the time, all the fractal geometry media files on the Internetwere computer generated, and I wanted to create a more realistic representation.After much searching, my team and I found a family that has been makingkaleidoscopes for three generations, so we bought one of their best pieces.Next, we rented a camera by RED, the leading manufacturer of the professionaldigital cinema cameras most often used in Hollywood films. We fitted the camerawith a lens that attaches to the end of a fiber-optic filament, which weinserted inside the kaleidoscope. Once we placed the camera inside thekaleidoscope, we affixed a motor to the end that rotates so its internalcrystals and oils would move in smooth, consistent transitions. For hours in aSeattle, Washington, studio we captured beautiful images and colors whilefilming against a black backdrop. The black represents the absence of anythingphysical (the place where we become no body, no one, no thing, no where, in notime). This is the infinite black space or void that you learned about inChapter 3 [../Text/chapter03.xhtml].As we recorded all the footage over the course of several days, gravity causedthe crystals and oil to fall and accelerate with every rotation, so a technicianhad to tediously account for every second, frame by frame, to ensure thetransitions were smooth. If the transition was not fluid, it risked breaking theviewer’s focus or trance state. It took months to refine our footage into theone-hour video that we use during our advanced workshops. Finally, we hadtalented composer Frank Pisciotti create the accompanying soundtrack. We wantedour students to be continuously mesmerized by the beautiful symmetry andchanging geometric forms.Mind Movies: The Motion Picture of Your FutureAt our advanced workshops, every participant receives a fun and easy-to-usesoftware program called Mind Movies to make a movie about their future self andtheir life. We use this in tandem with the kaleidoscope video. Depending on whatthe student wants to create in their life, the movie they make about theirfuture exposes them to images and specific written suggestions and informationdesigned to assist them in creating it—just like the shingles commercial helpsyou to read along. This could range from healing from a disease to strengtheningtheir immune system, creating a new job, manifesting new opportunities,traveling the world, attracting abundance, finding a new life partner, havingmystical experiences, and more. Its purpose is to remind them that they canaccomplish their dreams, create the uncommon, and become supernatural. The goalsof this personalized media presentation include: 1. Helping students get clear on the intention they want to create in their future; 2. Programing their conscious mind, as well as their unconscious mind, into that new future; 3. Changing their brain and body to biologically look like the future has already happened; 4. Repeatedly associating those pictures and images with music to create new neural networks in the brain and to emotionally recondition the body to a new mind. It’s a way for them to remember their future.The Mind Movie technology was founded by two business partners from Australia,Natalie and Glen Ledwell. They are not only the founders but also the posterchildren for its capabilities. Their journey began in 2007 when a friend showedthem a movie he had created about his life. Later, he approached them with theidea of starting a business based on what would become Mind Movie software.Getting the business off the ground required them to create a website todistribute the software so they could instruct people from all around the worldon how to make their own movies. Yet they already had four businesses and knewalmost nothing about the Internet or e-commerce. Glen could barely turn on acomputer and Natalie hadn’t even heard of YouTube. They recognized, however,that Mind Movie had the potential to be a very powerful tool to help peoplebuild the belief that they could create real outcomes in their lives.With that in mind, they decided to post a video about the power of Mind Movieson YouTube. At the end of the video, viewers were encouraged to visit theirwebsite, where they could learn how to build their own.In early 2008, after receiving countless e-mails from customers telling them howMind Movies had changed their lives, Natalie and Glen decided to go all in. Theyflew to the United States, attended an Internet marketing seminar, joined theMarketing Mastermind Group, and began planning Mind Movie’s global launch. Yetwhen they arrived in the United States, they had nearly drained their bankaccount, leaving almost no money to pay for the remaining services required tolaunch the business. This meant learning, mastering, and implementing everythingfor the launch themselves. For months, they worked 12-hour days out of theiroffice—otherwise known as their bedroom. In the process, they ventured so faroutside their comfort zone that they no longer knew what a comfort zone was.Faced with daily technical, business, and personal challenges, they had onesecret weapon in their arsenal—their own Mind Movie.In their Mind Movie, Natalie and Glen defined the number of customers theywanted to attract and who those customers would be. They described the respectof their industry peers and plotted out what they would do once their businesswas a success, such as the restaurants where they would eat and the familyholidays they would take. Finally, they wanted to produce $1 million worth ofsales (Why not aim high? they thought. Their marketing friends were doingmillion-dollar launches, albeit with $5,000 programs). They watched their MindMovie multiple times a day to de-stress and remain focused and inspired, eventhough everything in their current reality seemed to be working against them.But they knew all their effort, risk, and dreams would culminate on the day oftheir global launch. The finish line was in sight—and then the unthinkablehappened.Scheduled for September 2008, their launch coincided with the global financialcrisis. Financial institutions around the world were facing cataclysmic losses,while families and individuals lost their savings, assets, and livelihoods inthe worst downturn since the Great Depression. Meanwhile, Glen and Natalie werefacing their own financial hardships. By launching the business, they’d rackedup $120,000 in credit-card debt. If the business failed, they’d loseeverything—their home, cars, and investments, in addition to being buried underan insurmountable debt.On the morning of their launch, unbeknownst to them, their e-mail deliverysystem was down for scheduled maintenance, so none of their customers receivedconfirmation e-mails for their purchase. By lunchtime, they had already receivedthousands of customer support e-mail complaints, in addition to challenges withtheir online bank (the bank wanted to freeze their account due to unusualactivity). By evening, however, they had experienced the most memorable day oftheir lives.In the first hour on the first day, they had hit the $100,000 mark, and by day’send they’d grossed $288,000. In the end, Glen and Natalie ended up generating$700,000 based on a $97 program with no up-sells. But the story doesn’t endthere.They were, of course, delighted with their achievement, but they faced one lastmonumental challenge. Because of the volatile and uncertain financial climate atthe time, their bank froze their account so they couldn’t access the money. Thismeant they couldn’t pay commissions to their affiliates or the $120,000 theyowed to creditors, or deliver profit sharing to the people who had helped themlaunch the business. Everything hinged on their funds being released. Finally,after six months of sticking to their vision and watching their Mind Movie, theygained access to their account, lifting the financial burden that had nearlysent them into bankruptcy. But here’s where the story gets really good.As the world was still reeling economically, the value of the U.S. dollaragainst the Australian dollar was still grossly different, so thanks to theexchange rate, when they transferred their money back to Australia, they endedup earning an extra $250,000. With that, as well as with the commissions theyreceived in exchange for promoting partner affiliate programs, Glen and Natalieactually met their $1 million goal.They credit a huge part of their success—which was the complete opposite of whateveryone else in the world was experiencing—with the fact that they focused ontheir Mind Movie every single day.While this is a great example of the potential of Mind Movies, and while theoptions to create your own Mind Movie are endless, the process is relatively thesame. Students first pick their own song—one they will never tire of listeningto. Next, they choose images and/or videos of either themselves or a futureevent and lay them out sequentially to tell a story of what their future lookslike. Finally, we ask them to come up with specific words, phrases, oraffirmations to add to the scenes, which they superimpose over the images. Inthe exact same way that TV commercials program people to be victims or toexperience want and lack, Mind Movies can program students to be unlimited in alife they are capable of creating.In our advanced workshops, our students watch the kaleidoscope video before theywatch their Mind Movies because it helps them induce and sustain alpha- andtheta-trance states with their eyes open, opening the doorway between theconscious and subconscious mind. Throughout their meditation while in an alphaor theta brain-wave states, they are more suggestible to their own reprogrammingprocess. This is important because the more suggestible they are while usingtheir Mind Movie, the less likely they are to become analytical and haveconstant internal thoughts such as How’s this going to happen? or This isimpossible! or How am I going to afford that? or It didn’t happen last time sowhy should it now?While the kaleidoscope induces students into trance to open the subconscious toprogramming, the Mind Movie is the new program. Mind Movies program ourstudents’ subconscious minds the same way that television commercials programus, but in more positive, unlimited, and constructive ways. When our brain’sthoughts are silenced, the conscious mind is no longer analyzing incominginformation. As a result, whatever information we are exposed to in this stateencodes directly into the subconscious. Just like recording or videotapingsomething to be automatically played back later, we’re recording a new programin the subconscious mind.A great amount of research over the years has documented how the right and lefthemispheres of the neocortex relate to one another. We now know that the righthemisphere processes spatial, nonlinear, abstract, and creative thinking, whilethe left hemisphere processes logical, rational, linear, methodical, andmathematical thinking. The latest research, however, also suggests the righthemisphere processes cognitive novelty and the left hemisphere processescognitive routine.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch8_nt1] This means that when welearn new things, the right hemisphere is more active, and when new learningsbecome routine, they’re then stored in the left hemisphere.The majority of people operate from the left hemisphere of their brain becausethey’re hardwired into automatic habits and programs they’ve memorized. This iswhy language is stored in the left hemisphere—it’s routine. You can think aboutthe right hemisphere as the territory of the unknown and the left hemisphere asthe territory of the known. It makes sense, then, that the right hemispherewould be romantic, creative, and nonlinear, while the left hemisphere would bemethodical, logical, and structured. We’ve actually seen this dual processingoccurring while watching our students’ brain scans in real time.Because the kaleidoscope’s flow of geometric fractal patterns within patternsdoes not look like any one, any thing, any where, in any time, its patterns aredesigned to bypass the perceptual networks and associative centers in the brainthat relate to known people, things, objects, places, and times. Its ancientgeometrical patterns reflect repeating fractal patterns found all throughoutnature; thus they activate lower-brain centers. It’s for this reason you can’tlook into the kaleidoscope and see your Aunt Mary, a bicycle you owned in sixthgrade, or the house where you grew up—because you’re not activating ortriggering the associative centers related to the memories primarily located inthe left hemisphere of your brain. As you stop thinking and analyzing, and startmoving into alpha or theta brain-wave patterns, more activity occurs in theright hemisphere. If the left hemisphere operates in the known, and the righthemisphere operates in the unknown, as activity increases in your righthemisphere, you are more open to creating something unknown and new.Graphics 9A(1) and 9A(2) in the color insert show brain scans of two studentswho are in coherent alpha and theta states. In Graphic 9A(3), you’ll see anotherstudent’s entire brain in theta while viewing the kaleidoscope. Graphic 9A(4)shows the brain scan of a student watching the kaleidoscope; the right side oftheir brain is more activated while they engage in the novelty of the experienceduring a trance state.When we play the kaleidoscope in our advanced workshops, we play it in a darkroom so melatonin levels increase, thereby enhancing brainwave changes. I askstudents to relax and consciously slow down their breathing. As theirrespiration slows down, so do their brain waves, moving from beta to alpha. Ithen ask them to continuously relax into their body and to get ever more intouch with it. I want to get them into the state somewhere between half awakeand half asleep, when they’re most suggestible, further priming their brain toaccept the programming of their Mind Movie.Just as late-night infomercials influence people because the production ofmelatonin (in preparation for restorative sleep) causes their guard to drop, Iwant our students’ melatonin levels to be elevated and their brain waves to bein alpha and theta so they are wide open to the information and thepossibilities in their Mind Movie.The Soundtrack of Your Future LifeMusic has a way of calling up the memory of a specific time and place in ourlife. It’s for this reason the entertainer Dick Clark said, “Music is thesoundtrack of your life.” The moment a magically nostalgic song starts playing,your brain begins recalling images of certain times and places, and those imagesconnect you to the experience of different people and events. Neurologicallyspeaking, the song acts as an external cue, causing a specific set of neuralnetworks in your brain to fire. By association, you see images in your mind thathave been frozen in time. We call this an associative memory.If you take the memory of that song further and really feel it, get into it, andmaybe even sing and dance along, you might notice that the correspondingemotions connected to your memories begin to move throughout your body. Whetherthe memory of that song relates to your first love, spring break your senioryear of college, or what you felt before walking onto the field before thebiggest game of your life, every one of those memories is strongly embedded withfeelings and emotions. When you feel the emotion deeply enough, it connects youto the energy of your past, and the stronger the emotional response, the greaterthe memory. In the moment you feel and experience that memory, it brings yourpast to life, and in your mind you are instantly transported through time intothe experience. Just as it did in the past, your body comes out of its restingstate, causing you to feel the same emotions of your past and reproduce a levelof mind equal to that past memory. For that moment, your entire state of beingis in the past.Long-term memories are stronger when the amplitude of the emotions associatedwith the event is high. Whether a long-term memory is positive or negative,however, has no bearing on how our mind processes the memory. For example,memories of traumas, betrayals, and shocking events carry equally powerfulemotions, except they are negative rather than joyful. Once we remember andrelive the pain, fear, anger, sadness, and intensity of the emotions connectedto those traumatic memories, our internal chemical state changes. This causes usto pay more attention to whomever or whatever created the original emotions inour external environment.So what if you could create a movie of your future and pair it with a song thatmotivates and inspires you so much that it pulls you out of your resting state,changes your state of being, and connects you to the energy of your futurememories? If music is the soundtrack of your life, then just as certain songstransport you to the past, couldn’t you bring your future to life in the sameway?This is where Mind Movies come in. By purposefully pairing very powerful andmoving images of your future, adding words and phrases to reinforce the content,and combining them with elevated emotions and inspiring music, you createlong-term memories that move your biology out of the past and into the future.In other words, the images elicit feelings that correlate to the experiences youwant to have in your future. This could include images of homes you want to livein, vacations you want to take, a new career, the freedom of expression, ahealed relationship or body, interdimensional experiences, and so on. These arejust some of the infinite possibilities that exist in your future timeline. Whenyou watch your Mind Movie, as you connect to the feelings and emotions of yourfuture, the higher the emotions you feel, the more you pay attention to theimages that created those emotions. Now you’re creating long-term memories ofyour future—and you are bringing your future to life. The magical,interdimensional component of the future is your song, because it’s the feelingsassociated with your song that change your energy equal to how you will feelwhen that future unfolds. This is why it’s best to choose music that’sinspirational, motivational, or aspirational.Next, you add words of affirmation or knowing to the Mind Movie that remind youof who you are and what you believe about your future. You could even add atimeline if you want to. Some examples could include: * The doors of dimension open to me so I may experience the mystical. * My body is healing every day. * My words are law. * I feel loved deeply and daily. * Wealth flows to me. * All my needs are always met. * My body becomes younger every day. * The divine appears in my life every day. * My life partner is my equal and teaches me by example. * Synchronicities happen to me all of the time. * I feel more whole every day. * My immune system gets stronger each day. * I lead with courage in my life. * I am an unlimited genius. * I am always aware of the power within me and all around me. * I believe in myself. * I embrace the unknown. * When I call on Spirit it responds.If you think of your favorite music video or a scene from your favorite musical,chances are you know all the words of the song as well as the images thatcorrespond to every note, beat, melody, and harmony. Most likely, the power ofthat combination evokes a time and a place in your life that was inhabited by aparticular set of people, feelings, emotions, and experiences. This is exactlywhat you’re doing with your Mind Movies, except instead of remembering the past,you’re creating memories of the future. If you heard your song enough timeswhile observing the images of your future, isn’t it possible that when you heardyour song without viewing your Mind Movie, you’d be automatically transportedinto those images of a new future, just like you were transported back to yourpast? With practice, not only are you feeling the emotions that connect you tothe memories of your future, but your biology is aligning to that future aswell.You already know why this happens: If your body is the unconscious mind, and itdoesn’t know the difference between the experience that creates the emotion andthe emotion you create by thought alone, in the present moment your body beginsto believe it is living in that future reality. Since the environment signalsthe gene, and emotions are the consequences of experiences in the environment,by embracing the emotions of the event before the actual experience, you beginto change your body to be biologically aligned to your future in the presentmoment. Since all genes make proteins and proteins are responsible for thestructure and function of your body, your body begins to biologically change tolook like your future is already happening.Putting It All TogetherWhat if you invited a group of people to retreat from their lives for four orfive days, and in the process removed the constant stimulation in their externalenvironment that reminded them of who they thought they were as a personality?If you separated them long enough from the people they know, the places they go,and the things they do every day at the exact same time, they would be remindedof who they really are: unlimited human beings. And if you spent the first dayor two teaching them how to create more coherence in their hearts and brains—andthey repeatedly practiced cultivating these states every day—it makes sense thatsooner or later they would get better at opening their hearts and making theirbrains work more proficiently. In fact, they would be more focused on a visionof a new future without being distracted, and at the same time, they could moreeasily feel the emotions of that new future. As they created more coherence intheir brains and hearts, they would create more coherence in their own energyfields, and this would create a clearer electromagnetic signature.As they continuously worked on overcoming themselves, their bodies, theirenvironment, and time—slowing down and changing their brain waves, unfoldinginto the unified field, and transcending this three-dimensional environment—itwould become increasingly easier and more familiar for them to activate theirheart center and create. After they practiced getting beyond their body,emotions, habits, pain, disease, identity, limited beliefs, analytical mind, andunconscious programs, by the time the practice of Mind Movies was introduced,they would be ready to absorb a greater degree of information equal to who theywere becoming, which would increase their ability to connect with their future.This is how we use Mind Movies at our workshops.You can think of a Mind Movie as a 21st-century version of a vision board (atool used to clarify, focus on, and maintain specific life goals), except it’sdynamic instead of static. When used with the kaleidoscope, the Mind Movietechnology is a great tool to help you bring your future to life by repeatedlyexperiencing it. It’s also is a great way to gain clarity on what you want tounfold in your life—and to remind yourself on a daily basis what that futureholds for you. This is called intention.Because Mind Movie technology is so versatile, it can be used across manyapplications and in a variety of settings. Not only can the technology be usedto create relationships, wealth, health, careers, and other material items, it’salso being used with children and teens to help them create a future vision sothey feel they have some control over their lives. So many young people todayare overwhelmed because of the frenetic pace, pressure, and demands of socialmedia and modern society. Suicide is a leading cause of death for teens in theUnited States, so the founders of Mind Movie are using the technology in schoolsto help teens envision a brighter, more specific future for themselves.Mind Movies are also used in corporate settings for team building and visioning.Entrepreneurs use the software to develop businesses, create mission statements,and strategize and create business plans. Imagine a team of motivated people notonly reading and intellectualizing their mission statement, but also seeing itunfold in a dynamic, visual format—before it happens.Integrative healing is another arena in which practitioners use this technologyto help patients envision the healthiest version of themselves, assist them withtheir healing process, and keep them on task with a new lifestyle that must bemaintained daily. This includes addiction treatment and recovery facilitieshelping patients become clear on the future they want to create in the nextphase of their recovery. Mind Movies have also supported the generationallyunemployed in finding new jobs or careers and living more future-oriented andproductive lives, not only for themselves but also for their families.As you can see, the applications for this technology are endless. No matter howit’s applied, the power of Mind Movies resides in enabling people to construct anew reality by reminding themselves of the daily choices they must make, the newbehaviors they must demonstrate, and the feelings they want to live by. Once youprogram these feelings and behaviors subconsciously, you can break youraddiction to old habits, familiar lifestyles, and unconscious reactions. It’sentirely up to you how creative you want to get when piecing together yourfuture.While anytime is a good time to watch your Mind Movie, I suggest watching itfirst thing in the morning and right before bed, because this is when you aremost suggestible. If you watch it as soon as you wake up, you’re starting yourday off on a positive note by being mindful and focused on what you want toachieve for the day, as well as for your future. When you view it at nightbefore you go to bed, your subconscious mind can contemplate it while you sleep,align your body and mind to your future, and come up with solutions that yourautonomic nervous system can carry out while you sleep. Basically, you can useit anytime you need motivation or to make a different choice. They key is tomake sure you’re completely present when you watch it.Since implementing Mind Movies, I’ve seen our students manifest new homes andheard stories of homes selling that had been on the market for years. I’ve seenvacations spontaneously appear and witnessed new relationships develop out ofnowhere. I’ve listened to countless testimonials of abundance, freedom, newcareers, new cars, healings of all kinds, relief from unbearable hardships, andof course, profound mystical experiences that have permanently altered therecipients. But it’s not magic or sorcery. It’s simply learning how to become aconscious creator—learning how to align to your own destiny.Think of your Mind Movie as if you are turning on a radar device to track yourfuture. Then, as you repeatedly visit the future in your heart and mind, all thethoughts, choices, actions, experiences, and emotions you experience betweenyour present reality and your future reality become course corrections thatdeliver you to your target. The more you keep your future alive with yourintention, attention, energy, and love, the more it starts to unfold as a newreality because you’re remembering your future just as you remember your past.Your job, then, is to continuously fall in love with that vision of the future,keep your energy up, and not let the circumstances (environment), hardwiredattitudes, familiar negative feelings, or unconscious habits derail you fromyour goals.What makes this technology so profound is that we perceive reality based onpattern recognition—links between the neural networks in our brains and theobjects, people, and places in our external environment. For example, when yousee someone you recognize, the neural networks in your brain instantly recallmemories and experiences with that person. By contrast, if someone is not wiredin your brain, you probably won’t recognize them. If your brain doesn’t have thehardware (familiarity with the images, thoughts, and emotions from the MindMovie) installed before your future unfolds—if you don’t have the neuralarchitecture wired into your brain—how will you recognize your new partner, yournew job, your new house, or your new body? (Think of it like this: You can’topen a Microsoft Word document on a Mac computer unless you already have theMicrosoft Word software installed.) If you can’t feel the emotions and createthe energy of your future reality, you might not recognize or trust that futureunknown experience when it finds you. That’s because your energy and emotionalstate are not in alignment with that experience, so instead of feeling certaintyor a knowing, you may feel fear or uncertainty.So many of my advanced students have told me they are on their third, fourth,even fifth Mind Movie because everything in their previous ones has come true. Iam always amazed and humbled to hear the stories of how their creations came tobe. No matter how varied their manifestations are, they all share one thing:They trained the body to follow the mind toward an intentional future. Thismakes sense because if you have been putting in the time to study, memorize, andcreate the neural connections of your future, that is where you have beenplacing your attention. And as you know by now, where attention goes, energyflows.Take a look at Graphic 10 in the color insert. This shows an example of astudent’s brain activity while he is watching his Mind Movie. There is anenormous amount of energy in his brain because he is fully involved in theexperience.Taking It One Step Further: Getting DimensionalThere’s one final way we use the Mind Movie technology in our work. Once ourstudents have neurologically mapped their entire presentation, I ask them topick a scene from the Mind Movie and unfold into a particular space and time,experiencing that scene three-dimensionally in their mind during theirmeditation. If you notice, I never use the word visualize in my teachings.Visualization usually involves just seeing something in the mind’s eye, so itappears as a flat or two-dimensional image. For example, if you visualize apicture of a car, you will create a picture of a car. Instead, I want you toexperience everything in the scene using all five senses so it feels like areal-life, three-dimensional experience.Many people who have been introduced to my work have wondered why I spend somuch time on becoming aware of “the space” their body occupies in space, as wellas opening their focus to the space around their body and the space that theroom occupies in space. Aside from the coherent changes my cues produce in thebrain, it’s all training for this mindful activity of pairing our Mind Moviewith the kaleidoscope during meditation.When a student begins the dimensionalizing process, before they see anything intheir mind, they are instructed to unfold as an awareness into the scene. Whenthey start, I want the participant to become aware that they are in their sceneonly as a consciousness. This means they are not their body and they lack theirsenses. They begin as an awareness in the emptiness of space, as if they areincapable of seeing, hearing, feeling, tasting, or smelling anything.Once they become aware that they are an awareness, I ask them to choose a scenefrom their Mind Movie. This causes their brain to naturally start adding sensoryinput, which begins to bring dimension to the scene in their mind. Next they areinstructed to start sensing what’s to their right, their left, above them, andbelow them. The act of sensing fills in this scene with three-dimensionalstructures, forms, and space. As they expand their awareness to what else is inthe scene, their senses begin recruiting other senses, further filling in thescene with more forms, structures, curves, textures, scents, images, feelings,and space. Finally, when the scene comes to life in their mind, in the futurespace and time of that scene, they start inhabiting their body—not the body thatis sitting there in the chair meditating, but the physical body of their future.They are asked to feel their arms, legs, torso, muscles, and so on until theycan feel their entire body in that scene. Then they are ready to move about inthat scene and experience that reality.My theory is that when they simultaneously activate enough of the neuralnetworks assigned to the objects, things, and people in a specific space andtime, their possibility of having a full-on, holographic, IMAX-type experienceincreases. This is because as the student becomes present and unfolds into afully dimensional scene, a large majority of the brain turns on, including theneural architecture that is allocated to both the sensory (feeling) and motor(moving) aspects of their body, as well as the proprioception (awareness of bodyposition) of where they are in space. The next thing they know, they are havinga real-life sensory experience of their future with their eyes closed, in thepresent moment.Take a look at Graphic 11 in the color insert. It is the brain scan of a studentwho is experiencing a seemingly real Mind Movie scene in meditation. She hasquite a bit of energy in her brain while she is dimensionalizing the scene. Shedescribed this moment as a full-on virtual sensory experience. Her subjectiveexperience was quantified objectively in this scan.Many of our students have reported that the experiences in their meditation weremore real than any past external experience. Their senses were enhanced withoutexternal stimuli to excite their senses, yet all they were doing was sitting intheir chair with their eyes closed. Many have reported that in their lucidexperience, they smelled certain fragrances like colognes, the aroma of specificflowers like jasmine and gardenias, or the familiar scent of leather in theirnew car they were sitting in. I’ve also heard students report specific memories,like the stubble on their face from not shaving, the wind blowing through theirhair, or the feeling that their body was filled with a powerful energy. Studentshave also given testimony to specific sounds they could clearly hear, such asdistant church bells coming from a European church near where they werevacationing, or the bark of their dog when they were in their new home. Severalstudents have also said that the colors they saw were incredibly clear andvivid, or they experienced amplified tastes like coconut, chocolate, andcinnamon. The combination of all of the different senses literally created a newexperience for them.It’s our five senses that plug us into our external reality. Typically, when wehave a new experience, everything we see, hear, smell, taste, and feel is sentto the brain through those five sensory pathways. Once all that sensoryinformation makes it to the brain, clusters of neurons begin to organize intonetworks. The moment the neurons string into place, the limbic brain makes achemical called an emotion. Because experience enriches the brain and creates anemotion that signals new genes in the body, in the rich sensory moment of astudent’s internal experience—without ever using their external senses—they’rechanging their brain and body to look like their future has already happened.Isn’t that what experience does? I love to hear a person who has just come outof one of those experiences tell me, “You don’t understand—I was there! I knowit is going to happen because it already has and I already experienced it!”That’s because the experience has already happened.When we fully experience a reality in this field of consciousness and energywithout a body, the energy of the new experience serves as the template forphysical reality. The more energy you invest in your future, and the more youkeep experiencing and emotionally embracing it before it happens, the more youleave an energetic imprint in that future reality. And your body should followyour mind to that unknown future, because that’s where your energy is. As youcontinue to place your attention and energy on it, you fall more deeply in lovewith it, and because love bonds all things, you are bonding with that future andit is being drawn to you.For more information about the Mind Movie or the kaleidoscope, please visit mywebsite at drjoedispenza.com/mindmovies [http://drjoedispenza.com/mindmovies] ordrjoedispenza.com/kaleidoscope [http://drjoedispenza.com/kaleidoscope],respectively.Kaleidoscope and Mind Movie MeditationIn our advanced workshops, we instruct our students to create a Mind Moviebefore they arrive at our event so they can integrate their Mind Movies with thekaleidoscope video during meditation. We begin by getting heart centered, whichyou learned in Chapter 7 [../Text/chapter07.xhtml], locking into those elevatedemotions for several minutes and radiating that energy beyond their bodies intospace. Then we guide them in the following meditation.Unfold into the present moment, and when you attain that state, open your eyesand stare into the kaleidoscope. Once in trance, switch to your Mind Movie.Spend maybe eight minutes with the kaleidoscope, then eight minutes watchingyour Mind Movie, and then repeat the cycle. When you’ve watched your Mind Movieenough that you can predict the next scene, you’ve mapped it neurologically.Over time, you’ll associate different parts of the song you have chosen with thedifferent images of your Mind Movie.Finally, spend seven minutes watching the kaleidoscope while just listening tothe music from your Mind Movie. As you gaze into the kaleidoscope in trance andhear your song, by association your brain automatically recalls different imagesfrom your Mind Movie. This causes you to further remember your futurebiologically—automatically and repeatedly firing and wiring neural networks. Nowyour brain is being programmed to look like the new future has already happened,while the emotions are signaling new genes to biologically change your body inpreparation for your new future.Watch the kaleidoscope in tandem with your Mind Movie every day for a month, orat least try to watch your Mind Movie twice daily—as soon as you wake up andright before you go to sleep. You might even want to keep a journal to recordall the wonderfully unexpected adventures and serendipitous happenings that, asyou look back, you will see as points on a map that led you to manifesting thisfuture. Consider creating several Mind Movies—one for health and wellness, forexample, and another for romance, relationships, and wealth."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 9 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t9]image [../Images/line.jpg]WALKING MEDITATION [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t9]image [../Images/line.jpg]Most spiritual traditions embrace four meditation postures, and at our advancedworkshops we practice each of them. There’s sitting, which hopefully you’re inthe process of mastering; there’s standing and walking, which are combined inthe meditations you’ll learn in this chapter; and then there’s lying down. Whileeach type of meditation posture serves its own purpose, place, and time, eachbuilds upon the other to help us maintain and regulate our internal states—nomatter what is happening in our external environment.But what could be the relevance of bridging the sitting meditation with thestanding and walking meditation? Although practicing your meditation when youwake up is an ideal way to start your morning, if you can’t maintain that energyand awareness throughout the course of your day, you’re likely to fall rightback into the unconscious programs that have been running your life for years.For example, let’s say you just finished your sitting meditation. When you openyour eyes, you probably feel more alive, awake, clear, empowered, and ready tostart your day. Perhaps your heart feels open, expanded, and connected, orperhaps you just overcame an aspect of yourself, shifted your energy, andemotionally embraced a new future. But more often than not, you may fall rightback into your unconscious programs, and all the work you just did to create anelevated internal state dissolves into a never-ending to-do list: making lunchesand sending your kids off to school, rushing to work, getting irate at theperson who cut you off on the freeway, answering calls and returning e-mails,hustling to appointments, and so on. In other words, you’re no longer in acreative state because you’ve just returned to the habitual programs andsurvival emotions of your past. When this occurs, you disconnect from the energyof your future and essentially leave the energy you created right where you weresitting in your meditation, as opposed to carrying it with you throughout theday. You’ve energetically returned to your past.Since I too have been guilty of this, I started thinking about how our studentscould take this energy with them and embody it during the course of their day.That’s why I created a meditation that includes standing and walking—so thatwhen you become adept at raising your energy or frequency and marrying it with aclear vision, you now have a practice that enables you to maintain that elevatedenergy all day long so that over time this becomes your natural state of being.The purpose of this chapter is to help you do just that.Walking into Your FutureYou’ve already learned that throughout much of your day you are behavingunconsciously, unaware of what you’re doing and why. For instance, you may notremember driving to work because you were lost in an argument you had a few daysprior, or you may be focused on how you’re going to respond to your significantother’s angry text. Maybe you’re simultaneously running three programs atonce—texting, talking, and checking e-mails. You may not be aware of yournervous tics or their causes, your posture and how it’s perceived as shy, or howyour speech, facial expressions, and the energy you bring into a room affectyour coworkers. These unconscious programs and behaviors occur because the bodyhas become the mind, and it’s the combination of these unconscious programs thatmakes up who you are. You know by now that when the body becomes the mind,you’re no longer living in the present moment—and so you’re no longer in acreative state, which means you’re keeping your goals, dreams, and visions atarm’s length.By becoming aware of these unconscious behaviors and programs, however, you canwork to actively broadcast a new electromagnetic signature that is in line withyour future—and the more you broadcast that electromagnetic signature into thefield, the sooner you will become it, and it will become you. When there’s avibrational match between your energy and that future potential that alreadyexists in the quantum field, that future event is going to find you—or betteryet, your body will be drawn to a new reality. You will become a magnet to a newdestiny, which will manifest as an unknown, new experience.For a moment, think of your future reality as if it already exists, vibrating asunmaterialized energy in the quantum field. Imagine your future as the vibrationcoming from a tuning fork that has just been struck. The sound it emits is avibration traveling on a certain frequency. If you also exist as a tuning fork,as you change your energy to resonate within the same harmonic of that quantumpossibility of your future, you connect with, and align to, that frequency. Thelonger you can maintain and tune your energy in to that frequency, the more youvibrate at the same harmonic of energy. Now you’re connected to that futurereality because you’re operating at the same frequency or vibration. The closerfrequencies come together in space and time, the more they influence each otheruntil they entrain to one frequency. That’s the moment when your future findsyou. This is how you create new realities.It stands to reason, then, that the instant your energy changes because you’refeeling lower, survival emotions, there’s dissonance and incoherence between youand your future reality. You are no longer resonating within the frequency ofthat possibility, and this causes you to become out of sync with the future youare trying to create. If you can’t give up that reaction because the addictionto those emotions has a grip on you, you’ll just wind up creating more of thesame reality because your energy is vibrating equal to the reality you’rereacting to.In Chapter 3 [../Text/chapter03.xhtml], you learned that all possibilities existin the eternal now and that when you get beyond your identity as a bodyconnected to people, objects, places, and time, you become pure consciousness.You become no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time. It is in thatelegant moment that you transcend the material realm of matter and enter thequantum field of information and energy. Now that you are beyond yourassociations to this physical reality, you are creating from the unified field;thus you are creating from a level of energy that is greater than matter. Forthe most part, our students have practiced this sitting down. The purpose of thestanding and walking meditation is to make you more mindful of the presentmoment, to help you maintain and sustain elevated states throughout the day, tokeep you more connected to that future with your eyes open, and to assist you inliterally stepping into your new future.When you begin practicing walking meditations, it’s best to find a quiet placein nature so you’re not easily distracted. The fewer people and less activityaround you, the easier it is to stay focused. Eventually, when you get better atit, you can practice this in a shopping mall, while walking your dog, orsomewhere else out in public.In many ways, the standing and walking meditations are just like the seatedones. You begin by standing still, closing your eyes, and resting your attentionin your heart, all the while slowing down your breath and breathing in and outof this center. When you feel heart centered, just as you do in your seatedmeditations, you begin cultivating elevated emotions that connect you to yourfuture.Once you feel fully grounded in these elevated emotions, for a few minutes openyour focus and radiate that energy beyond your body until you feel it within youas well as all around you. Next, lay upon the energy of these elevated emotionsthe intent of what you want for your day or your future, whether it’s to radiatea synchronicity, lead a noble life, make a difference in the world, create a newjob or relationship, or something else. Now you are broadcasting a newelectromagnetic signature into the field. The only difference is that instead ofsitting with your eyes closed and radiating loving, elevated emotions, you’restanding up with your eyes closed so that when you open your eyes and beginwalking, you’ll be able to embody that elevated energy.As you continue to stand, eyes closed, with an open focus, you take yourattention off of the outer world, and your brain waves slow down from beta toalpha states. This causes the thoughts, analysis, and chatter inside your headto quiet down, inducing a trance state and making you more suggestible. As youlearned in the previous chapter, the longer you can remain in this trance state,the less resistance there is to new information entering your subconscious mind.When you’re in an elevated emotional state that aligns you with your future, youwill be more prone to accept, believe, and surrender to the intentional thoughtsequal to those emotions. This means the thoughts, visions, pictures, and imagesyour mind is creating can make it past the analytical mind and you can programthe autonomic nervous system to create the biology of your new future.Since you have created the energy of your new future while standing with youreyes closed, now it’s time to open your eyes and begin walking. Don’t look atanyone, and don’t pay attention to objects or things, or anything else aroundyou. Simply keep your focus open, transfix your gaze on the horizon, and remainin trance. The more you’re in trance, the less likely you’ll be to think in old,familiar ways. In the meantime, your mind will be connecting to the images ofyour new future rather than replaying programs of the past. Now you’re ready towalk into your future as someone else.Because you are walking as your future self, you now have to become aware of theway your current self has always unconsciously walked. It’s time to alter yourstride, your pace, your posture, your breathing, and your movements. You mightsmile instead of staring blankly. You may have to imagine what walking as awealthy person feels like by modeling a wealthy person. You might adopt theposture of a courageous person you admire, walk within the elevated energy ofyour future healthy body, or walk as an open-hearted, loving, accepting person.Basically, you’re consciously embodying the person you’ve always dreamed youcould be, but walking as if your future self is imperative. For example, youmight imagine that it’s one or two years later and you already have all thethings you want. The most important ingredient is for you to embody that futureperson now. If you already are that identity, you no longer need to wish youwill become that person because it’s already happened—you already embody thequalities of your future. You are simply thinking, acting, and feeling yourfuture self.As you begin to practice walking differently, and continue to practice day inand day out, you’re going to get into the habit of walking like a wealthyperson, thinking like a healthy person, standing like a confident person, andfeeling like a free, unlimited, grateful person (gratitude means it alreadyhappened), instead of perhaps a beat-up, worn-down, stressed-out person. Themore you practice, the more this new way of being will become a new habit, andthese habits will become your new automatic patterns of thought, behaviors, andemotions. Once you start naturally feeling and embodying these elevatedemotions, they will inhabit you, and you will actually become the person youwant to be. Graphic 12 in the color insert shows a student who changes his brainin about an hour after doing a walking meditation.Priming the Brain for Future MemoriesThe walking meditation is also about creating memories of things that haven’thappened yet in linear time—in effect, remembering your future. When you produceelevated feelings with your eyes closed, radiate that energy beyond the field ofyour body, and then open your eyes and begin walking and leading with your heart(feeling those elevated emotions with your eyes open), the more you feel thatemotion, the more you’re going to pay attention to the pictures, images, andthoughts that are creating your feelings. This process naturally upgrades yourneural circuitry by creating a new inward experience. Experience enriches thebrain and creates memories. Now your brain is no longer living in the past; it’sliving in the future. The more you embody your elevated emotions correctly, themore your brain and body will look like the future experience has alreadyhappened. That means you’re technically remembering your future.Remaining in trance is important because as you align your body with your futureand change your inner world, you’re creating long-term memories. Since where youplace your attention is where you place your energy, you may even want to flashscenes of your Mind Movie in your head while you’re envisioning, embodying, andfeeling your future. As you do this, those Mind Movie scenes will become theenergetic and biological maps to your future. The act of feeling the emotions ofyour future (in the present moment) and combining these emotions with yourintention does two things: It installs new circuits to make your brain anintentional map to the future and it also produces the emotional chemicals forthat future event, which signals new genes in new ways, thus conditioning yourbody to prepare it for a new destiny.Remember that this meditation is not about what you get in life; it’s about whoyou become—or who you are in the process of becoming. If you are trying to “get”wealth, success, health, or a new relationship, you are still conditioned tothinking you are separate from some thing and you have to go get it. But thetruth is that the more you become that person, the more reality will shape andmold equal to your new state of being. It’s that process of consciously becomingthat helps you maintain alignment to a different destiny. The more you practicethe walking meditation and walk as your future self, the more you should be ableto change your state of being with your eyes open, just as you did with youreyes closed. When you practice this enough times, you’ll not only carry thatenergy with you throughout the day, but you’ll embody it. This type ofrepetition will make you feel more mindful in your waking hours, and before youknow it you’ll start automatically behaving, thinking, and feeling differently.This is programming a new personality to a new personal reality.Over time, who knows? You might find yourself naturally walking like a happyperson; behaving like a courageous and compassionate leader; thinking like anoble, empowered genius; feeling like a worthy, abundant entrepreneur. In themiddle of your day you might become aware of the fact that the pain in your bodyis gone because you’re feeling so whole, unlimited, and in love with life. Whatyou’ve done has made a habit out of being the person you want to be. This isbecause you installed the circuitry and signaled the latent gene to think, act,and feel in a new way. Biologically, you have become that person.Becoming mindful and embodying your future self can occur many times throughoutyour day. Imagine that you’re waiting for a friend who is running late, andinstead of feeling frustrated and bothered, you’re generating the energy of yourfuture. When you’re sitting in traffic, instead of getting impatient and angry,practice tuning in to the energy of your future with your eyes open. Imaginethat when you’re in line at the grocery store and judging a person for whatthey’re buying, you redirect your thoughts to feeling incredibly grateful foryour new life, walking as your future self. Imagine when you walk to your car inthe parking lot or to your mailbox, you’re naturally empowered by the thought ofyour new life. You’ll then begin to accept, believe, and surrender to thethoughts equal to that emotional state, and as you surrender to those thoughts,your body will make the chemistry equal to that emotional state. This is how youbegin to program your autonomic nervous system into a different destiny, and themore you practice it, the less likely you are to return to autopilot and missthe present moment.The Walking MeditationBegin by finding a quiet space in nature. Disconnect from your externalenvironment and anchor yourself in the present moment by closing your eyes.Acknowledge your heart center, where the soul and heart intersect with theunified field, and bring elevated emotions such as gratitude, joy, inspiration,compassion, love, and so on to this center. If you are going to believe in yournew future with all of your heart, it had better be open and activated.Rest your attention on the heart, allowing your breath to flow in and out ofthis center—ever more slowly, more deeply, and more relaxed—for about twominutes. Return to creating elevated emotions within your heart for two to threeminutes. Radiate that energy into the space surrounding your body in space andstay present with that energy. Tune in to the energy of your future.After a few minutes, hold a clear intention in your mind’s eye. You might pick arepresentative symbol that connects you to the energy of your future, the wayyou learned in Chapter 3 [../Text/chapter03.xhtml]. Change your state of beingwith the feelings of these elevated emotions, and focus on broadcasting that newelectromagnetic signature into the field. Remain in this state for two to threeminutes.Next, open your eyes, and without looking at anything or anyone, open your focusand keep your awareness on the space around your body in space while maintaininga trance state. Begin walking with your eyes open while you stay entranced. Witheach step you take, embody that new energy—that new frequency of whatever you’recreating in your future. As you take this energy with you during your waking,daily life, walking as your new self, you are activating the same neurologicalnetworks and producing the same level of mind as when you meditate with youreyes closed.Next remember your future. Let the images come, feeling them and embodying them.Own them. Become them. Continue to walk for about ten minutes, and then stop torecalibrate. Once again, close your eyes and raise your energy. Stay presentwith this energy for about five to ten minutes. For the next ten minutes, withyour eyes open in trance, walk again with intent and purpose as your futureself. With each step you take, embodying this new energy, you move closer toyour destiny and it moves closer to you.Do this cycle two times. When you finish the second round, stop and stand stillone last time, really focusing on how you feel with your fourth energy centeropen. You can use this opportunity to affirm who you are based on how you feel.For example, if you’re feeling unlimited, you can literally acknowledge, “I amunlimited.” Next, place your hand over your beautiful heart, and be willing tofeel valuable and worthy enough to receive what you have created. Raise yourenergy to its zenith and feel gratitude, appreciation, and thankfulness.Now acknowledge the divine within you—the energy that powers you and gives riseto all of life. Give thanks for a new life before it’s made manifest.Acknowledging the power within you, ask that your life be filled with unexpectedwonder, synchronicities, and coincidences that create a joy for existence.Radiate your love while loving your new life into existence."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 10 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t10]image [../Images/line.jpg]CASE STUDIES: MAKING IT REAL [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t10]image [../Images/line.jpg]In the case studies that follow, you’ll be introduced to people just like youwho took time out of their busy lives to create a new future. Every day theydefined themselves by a vision of this future instead of by the memories oftheir past. You could say they were more in love with their future than theywere with their past. The act of doing the work daily and turning the practicesin the last three chapters into a skill led them to become more supernatural.Pay attention to how simple they made it.Tim Gets the Key to His FutureAt an advanced workshop in Seattle, which typically coincides with Halloween, weask our students to dress up as their future selves on the first night. Timdressed up as a supernatural swami. He’d always wanted to be a swami, subscribedto the lifestyle, and at a young age had left his hometown in Connecticut tostudy in an ashram. At the start of the event, participants also received a giftfrom our company—a key to symbolize unlocking the potential of eachparticipant’s future self.Tim had attended several advanced-level workshops in the past. The first time hemade a Mind Movie, he inserted a picture of gold and silver coins in one of hisscenes. For years, he had been trying to surrender the emotion of fear, but at acertain point he realized that behind the fear was unworthiness; so for Tim, thecoins were a symbol of worthiness.“Everybody wants wealth,” he told me. “But because I was on the spiritual path,into yoga and everything else that goes with it, I had the mentality that I hadto be poor and embrace poverty to truly walk the talk. So instead of the goldand silver coins merely representing wealth, they represented being worthy toreceive.”For Tim’s Seattle Mind Movie, he added more images to evolve his vision. Asanother symbol for worthiness, Tim used a Chinese character that meant “wealth,”but because he never desired money, below the symbol he placed the wordaffluence. He preferred affluence because when he looked up the word’sdefinition, he found that its Latin root meant “to flow toward.” Wouldn’t it begreat, he thought, if everything I wanted flowed toward me?Although Tim is very analytical, after continuously watching his Mind Movie intandem with the kaleidoscope, he found he could quickly bypass the analyticalmind and get into the subconscious mind, the operating system, to program hisfuture.During the workshop, when it came time to dimensionalize a scene in his MindMovie, he had a profound experience. He started to feel joy and then a wildlyenthusiastic love for life, almost like a burning sensation in his heart. Hesaid he felt as if he could set the world on fire. Then, during the meditation,I told the students it was time to open up and receive, and that’s when Tim saysenergy began to enter his body.“I don’t know where it came from,” he told me. “But it was like someone hadturned on a spigot. I shot straight up. The energy came in through the top of myhead and then moved out through my hands. My palms were face down, yet withoutconscious control, the energy caused them to lift and turn over. I lost track oftime and space and had no idea where I was, but for the rest of the meditation Iwas in an ecstatic, exalted state. I knew somehow that everything was going tobe different and that I was no longer the same person.”When the energy downloaded into Tim, he believed it was carrying a message ofworthiness, because he was never the same afterward.“I am convinced that the new information that came into my body rewrote my DNA,erasing the old self, because that part of my personality is now gone,” he says.When Tim got home to Phoenix, where he owned and operated a futon shop, hereturned to business as usual on Monday morning. On Thursday, a woman who hadpurchased a futon from him several years earlier came into his shop. Since theday she purchased the futon, they had formed a friendship and every few weeksshe would stop by to chat. She was now retired and came into the shop to tellTim she had just finished making out her will. She wanted Tim to be herexecutor. Tim felt honored, and he thanked her.“Here it is,” she said, placing it on the counter along with a key. “Read it.”Tim began scanning the document to discover that not only was he the executor,but she was also bequeathing him $110,000 worth of gold and silver coins. Thekey she placed on the counter was the key to her safe-deposit box, where shekept the coins (which, of course, matched the picture in Tim’s Mind Movie). Inan instant, Tim remembered the similar “key to his future” he had received atthe advanced workshop in Seattle. Now that’s being worth it!Sarah Can’t Touch the GroundOn Labor Day 2016, Sarah severely injured her back attempting to prevent afive-ton boat from crashing into a dock. For seven weeks, she was in agony asshe endured physical therapy, took a cocktail of medications, and made countlessvisits to the chiropractor. After nothing else helped, her doctors scheduledSarah for surgery. But first, she decided to attend an advanced workshop inCancun.Because of how much pain Sarah was in, her son suggested she bring a wheelchair.She decided not to, and when she arrived at the hotel she collapsed on the floorin pain. Later, when she got into the pool on a float, she had severe spasmswhen she attempted to get out.Sarah was not new to my work, so she came to Cancun with her meditation cushionand her Mind Movie. In her Mind Movie, she was healthy, strong, and able to runagain. She could play basketball with her son and lacrosse with her daughter.Every time Sarah saw herself in the scene performing aerial yoga, she embracedthe joy she knew she would feel if she could actually do it, and when she heardthe song from her Mind Movie, her energy rose.During the first few days, when she was tightening her core muscles and drawingenergy up her spine with the breathing technique, she felt her sciatic nervepulsating. It was as if a warm electric current was traveling up the nerve. Atthe same time, she had the intention that the energy was a healing lightascending her spinal column.On the third day, she started her morning by searching the Internet until shefound an image of a woman doing aerial yoga. She carried that image in her mindall day. That afternoon, our students were working with the kaleidoscope andtheir Mind Movies. After they unfolded into the quantum field, I then asked themto dimensionalize a scene from their Mind Movie. When the meditation wasfinished, I instructed them to lie down on the floor—but as Sarah told me later,she couldn’t find the floor. She kept reaching lower and lower, searching forit, but it was no longer there. The next thing she knew, she was in anotherdimension having a full-on IMAX-like sensory experience—but without her senses.She was living a future scene of her Mind Movie. Enough circuits in her brainhad turned on to make her internal experience as real as any external experienceshe had ever had. She was not visualizing this scene—she was in it, living it.“I realized I was in another reality, a different time and space—I was in myfuture,” she explained. “And I was actually performing aerial yoga. I washanging upside down and the floor wasn’t there. I kept reaching for it, but Iwas just swinging upside down from this beautiful red silk scarf. I felt freedomfrom my pain. I was swinging freely in space.” Eventually she did lie down, withtears of joy flowing down her cheeks. When she came out of that meditation, allof her pain was gone.“I knew I was healed,” she said. “I was in awe of the power of my mind and Ifelt tremendous gratitude. I continue to manifest things from my Mind Movie—infact, my Mind Movie can’t even keep up with my life.”Terry Walks into a New FutureIn September 2016, while practicing her walking meditation along Australia’sbeautiful Sunshine Coast, Terry had a profound experience. Toward the end of hermeditation, when she stopped for the final part, she was feeling connected,uplifted, and expansive. As she followed my instructions, she opened herself upto the field with the intention of being worthy of her future life. With nowarning, she felt an electric charge enter her body through the crown of herhead, where it continued to flow down into her heart. As the energy coursedthrough the rest of her body, surging through her thighs and down into her feet,her legs began shaking uncontrollably.“The only way I can describe it is that there was an intense shaking from theinside,” she told me, “but it was a voltage of energy that my body had neverexperienced. I thought I was going to fall over. It was at that point I lost allconscious control over my lower body.” She burst into uncontrollable tears, andwith that release, her mind and body also began to let go. Time appeared tostand still. Terry understood that her body was surrendering a lifetime of pastunresolved emotions. As the surge of electricity continued to move through her,she felt huge amounts of dense, dark matter falling away from her body.“I believe this matter was trauma, not only from my lifetime, but also pastlifetimes,” she remembered. “It included the trauma of my father nearly dyingfrom a suicide attempt when I was eight, which has cast a shadow over my life bypreventing me from allowing myself to receive unconditional love.” She felt allher limiting beliefs—many of which she had acquired through deep emotionalconditioning and the unconscious beliefs of others—simply dissolve.“Everything that was not in alignment with who I really am just fell away,”Terry said. “I experienced true liberation, something my soul has been yearningfor for a very long time. I knew in that moment that my soul had guided me tothat very beach, at that very moment, with all these people, to do thisimportant work.”She fell to her knees, an overwhelming amount of love flowing through her.Kneeling in the sand, humbled by this power, she saw that every choice she hadmade up to that point was necessary for her to arrive at this poignant moment.In that instant, she observed who she had been for the last year, consistentlychoosing to do the meditations every day, all the while falling in love withherself. She knew that her future self in that moment was calling her past selfto have this experience of profound love.When Terry came back to the three-dimensional reality of her senses, she felt anoverwhelming sense of peace and oneness with everything around her. She reporteda deep reconnection to her physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual self, andsaid she felt more like “herself” then she had in a very long time.“This experience reminded me that I am, as we all are, an aspect of divineenergy,” she said, “and that I am worthy of receiving it.”"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 11 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t11]image [../Images/line.jpg]SPACE-TIME AND TIME-SPACE [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t11]image [../Images/line.jpg]We live in a three-dimensional universe (uni- meaning “one”) where everythingthat exists is made up of people, objects, places, and time. For the most part,it is a dimension of particles and matter. Through our senses we experiencethese things as form, structure, mass, and density. If I placed an ice cube,your cell phone, or an apple pie in front of you, for example, you could notexperience any of these objects without your senses; it’s your senses that giverise to your experience of physical reality.While the ice cube, cell phone, and apple pie all have height, width, and depth,they only exist to you because you can see, hear, taste, smell, and feel them.If you lost your five senses or they were simultaneously eliminated, you wouldbe incapable of experiencing these physical objects because you would have noawareness of them; they would literally not exist to you because in thisthree-dimensional reality you can’t experience them without your senses—or canyou?According to astrophysics, in this realm of three dimensions—the known universe(let’s call it space-time reality)—there’s an infinite amount of space. Take amoment to ponder that concept. From the small perch where we sit staring outinto the universe when we look up at the night sky, we see only a sliver of theuniverse. It appears to us as infinite, and yet infinite is even bigger thanthat. In other words, in the realm of space-time, space is eternal—it has no endand goes on forever. But what about time?The way you and I typically experience time is by moving our bodies throughspace. For example, it might take you five minutes to set this book down, walkto the kitchen, pour a glass of water, and return. This occurs because a thoughtthat originated in your mind created a vision of what you were going to do inthe kitchen, you acted on that thought, and consequently you experienced time bymoving from one point to another through space.Before you walked to the kitchen and as you were sitting in your chair, when youbecame conscious of the kitchen in relation to where you were sitting, youexperienced a separation of two points of consciousness: where you sat and thekitchen. To close the gap between those two points of consciousness, you movedyour body through space, and that took time. It makes sense, then, that thegreater the space or distance between two points, the greater the time it takesto get from one point to the other. Conversely, the faster the speed at whichyou travel between these two points, the shorter the amount of time it takes.This measurement of the time it takes an object to move through space is thefoundation for Newtonian physics (or classical mechanics). In the Newtonianworld, if we know certain properties about an object, such as its force,acceleration, direction, speed, and the distance it will travel, we can maketime-based predictions; therefore, Newtonian physics is based on knowns andpredictable outcomes. We can say, then, that when there’s a separation betweentwo points of consciousness, as you move from one point of consciousness toanother point of consciousness, you are collapsing space. As a result ofcollapsing space, you experience time. Take a look at Figure 11.1 to furtherunderstand the relationship between space and time in our three-dimensionalworld.Here’s another example: If I am writing this book and I want to finish thischapter, it’s going to take time. I may not have to move my body very muchthrough space, but I still experience time. Why? Because where I presently am inthe process of writing this chapter represents one point in consciousness, andfinishing the chapter represents another. The completion of this chapterrepresents a future moment separate from the present moment. The spacebetween—the closing of the gap between these two points in consciousness—is theexperience of time. If you look at Figure 11.1 again, it will help you gain abetter understanding about time.To achieve my desired goal of arriving at the end of the chapter, I repeatedlyhave to do “something.” This requires me to use my senses to interact with andmove through my environment with a coordinated set of behaviors—and again, thistakes time. If I cease writing and do something else, such as watch a movie,it’s going to take more time for me to reach my intended result; therefore, toachieve my goal of completing this chapter I must consistently align my actionsto match my intentions.image [../Images/p275.jpg]As we move through space from one point of consciousness to another point ofconsciousness, we experience time. When we collapse space in our 3-D world, timeis created.In this material world of three dimensions, because we use our senses tonavigate space, we place most of our attention on physical things such aspeople, objects, and places. They all are made of matter and they are localized(meaning they occupy a position in space and time). These all represent pointsof consciousness from which we experience separation. For instance, when youobserve your best friend sitting across the table from you or look at your carparked in the driveway, you notice the space between you and your friend or thecar. As a result, you feel separate from them. You are here and your friend orthe car is there. In addition, if you have dreams and goals, then where you arein the present moment and where your dreams exist as a reality in your futurealso creates the experience of separation. It’s safe to say, then, that: 1. In order for us to navigate this three-dimensional reality we need our senses. 2. The more we use our senses to define reality, the more we experience separation. 3. Because most of this three-dimensional reality is sensory based, space and time create the experience of separation from every one, every thing, every place, and every body, in every time. 4. All things material occupy one position in space and time. That’s called locality in physics.In this chapter, we are going to explore and contrast two models of reality:space-time and time-space. Space-time is the physical Newtonian world based onknowns, predictable outcomes, matter, and the three-dimensional universe inwhich we live (which is made up of infinite space). Time-space is thenonphysical quantum world—an inverse reality based on unknowns, endlesspossibilities, energy, and the multidimensional multiverse where we also live(which consists of infinite time).I’m going to challenge your understanding and perception of the nature ofreality, because if you’re going to experience the mystery of self as adimensional being, you’re going to need a road map to get there.Stress and the Consequences of Living in a Perpetual State of SurvivalBecause we use our senses to observe and determine physical reality, we identifyas a body living in space and time, yet separate from everything in ourenvironment. Over time, this interaction creates the experience of our identity.Throughout our lives, via the different interactions we have at certain timesand places with people, things, and objects, our identity evolves into apersonality. The quality of these interactions with our external environmentcreates lasting memories and these memories shape who we become. We call thisprocess experience, and it is life’s experiences that shape who we are. And asyou know, the majority of people’s personality is based on past experiences.As you learned in Chapter 8 [../Text/chapter08.xhtml], to our brains, thematerial objects, things, people, and places that we perceive daily occur to usas patterns, and the recognition of these patterns is called memory. If the selfis created from memories of past experiences, then memories are based on knowns;therefore, most of our three-dimensional world is based on knowns. This is wheremost us focus our attention. When you align everything material in your externalworld with the memories of your past experiences, you recognize them asfamiliar. You’re matching a physical reality with a set of neurological networksin your brain. This is called pattern recognition and it’s the process wherebymost people perceive reality through a lens of the past.We could say, then, that we’re materialists not only living in this dimension,but also enslaved to and limited by it—because we’ve defined ourselves as abody, living in an environment, at certain times, and our focus is more onmatter and less on energy. From a quantum perspective, we’re keeping ourattention on the physical particle (matter) instead of the immaterial wave ofpossibilities (energy). This is how we become immersed in this three-dimensionalreality.When stress is thrown into the equation, our body begins to draw from theinvisible electromagnetic field of energy around us to produce chemistry. Thegreater the frequency, intensity, and duration of the stress, the more energyour body consumes. The very nature of these chemicals endorses our senses,causing us to pay attention to matter and knowns. As this vital field of energyaround our body shrinks, we feel more like matter and less like energy. In fact,when our frequency slows down, our bodies become more dense as we run out ofenergy.As we’ve discussed, this is fine for the short term when danger, crisis, or apredator is lurking around the corner—in fact, the fight-or-flight response hasbeen a cornerstone of our evolution. In this state, stress chemicals heightenour senses, narrowing our focus to whatever matter in our environment representspotential danger. When this happens, our neocortex—the part of our braininvolved in sensory perception, motor commands, spatial reasoning, andlanguage—fires and becomes aroused. For survival purposes, this narrows ourfocus on our body and the external threat, causing us to become preoccupied bythe time between the moment of the perceived threat and the moment we reachphysical safety—both of which are points of consciousness. The more weexperience stress, the more we feel separation.As you read in Chapter 2 [../Text/chapter02.xhtml], the long-term effect ofliving in survival mode is that we begin to thrive on—and become addictedto—these stress chemicals. The more addicted we are to them, the more we believewe are our bodies that are local—that is, that are living in a particular placein space and occupying a particular position in linear time. The result is amanic, frenetic state where we continuously shift our attention from one person,to one problem, to one thing, to one place in our environment. The evolutionarytrait that once protected us now works against us, and we live on constant highalert, obsessing about time. Because we view our external environment as unsafe,all of our attention is on our environment.As our outer world now appears more real than our inner world, we’re addicted tosomeone or something in our external environment, and the longer we live in thisstate, the more our brain moves into high-beta brain waves. And as you know bynow, prolonged high-beta brain waves cause us to feel pain, anxiety, worry,fear, anger, frustration, judgment, impatience, aggression, and competition. Asa result, our brain waves become incoherent—and so do we.When the emotions of survival have a hold on us, we need the conditions in ourexternal world (our problems with different people, financial hardships, fear ofterrorism, disdain for our job) to reaffirm our addiction to those emotions.These emotional addictions cause us to become preoccupied by whatever we thinkmight be causing the upset in our environment—whether it be “some one” or “something”—and as a result the survival gene switches on. Now we’re living in aself-fulfilling prophecy.If you understand that where you place your attention is where you place yourenergy, you know that the stronger the emotional reaction associated with thecause, the more you will consistently place all your attention on a person,thing, or problem in your external world. When you do this, you are giving quitea bit of your power away to some one or some thing. Now all your attention andenergy is anchored in this three-dimensional realm of the material and youremotional state is causing you to continuously reaffirm your present reality.You can become emotionally attached to the reality you really want to change.This mismanagement of your energy keeps you enslaved to the world of the knowns,trying to predict the future based on the past; what’s more, when you’re in thesurvival state, the unknown or the unpredictable is a scary place. So for you totruly make changes in your life, you would have to step into the unknown—and ifyou don’t, nothing ever really changes.The Newtonian 3-D Space-Time Reality: Living as a Some Body with Some Thing,Some Where, in Some TimeIf feelings and emotions are a record of the past, and those feelings aredriving your hardwired thoughts and behaviors, you’ll keep repeating your pastand therefore become predictable. Now you’re firmly ensconced in the Newtonianworld because Newtonian physics is based on predictable outcomes. The more youlive in stress, the more you are simply matter trying to affect matter—mattertrying to fight, force, manipulate, predict, control, and compete for outcomes.As a result, everything you want to change, manifest, or influence is going totake a lot of time, because in this space-time reality you have to move yourphysical body through space to create the outcomes you want.The more you are living in survival and using your senses to define reality, themore you experience separation from a new future. Between where you arepresently, as one point of consciousness, and where you want to be, as anotherpoint of consciousness, lies a very long distance, not to mention that yourconstant obsession on how it’s going to happen is based on how you think andpredict it should happen. But if you’re predicting, your thinking is based onknowns, so there’s no room for an unknown or new possibility in your life.If you are trying to buy a house, for example, you need to save for a downpayment, look for a house, get a loan, go through the application process, beatout other buyers, and then spend 30 years dragging your body back and forth towork (through space) trying to pay it off. These two points inconsciousness—having the idea to buy the house and having the house with themortgage paid off—are going to take time to intersect. In a similar way, if youwant a new relationship, you might go online, set up a profile, scroll throughcountless other profiles, make a list of people to reach out to, contact eachone, and eventually go on many dates in the hopes of finding someone intriguing.If you want a new job, you might take the time to create a résumé, search foropen positions, and go on interviews.What these processes have in common is they require time, which you experienceas linear. You may get what you want but the more you live in survival, the moretime it’s going to take because you’re matter trying to influence matter, andthere is a distinct separation in space and time between where you are and whereyou want to be.We can agree, then, that in this three-dimensional reality, within yourexperience of time, there’s a definite past, present, and future. Since you livein linear time, you also experience a separation from time because the past,present, and future appear as separate moments in time; you are here and yourfuture is there. Figure 11.2 graphically represents how the past, present, andfuture all exist as distinct, discontinuous moments.image [../Images/p280.jpg]In our 3-D reality, the past, present, and future exist as linear, distinct,separate moments in time.As I said earlier, thanks to Newtonian physics we’ve unraveled the natural lawsof force, acceleration, and matter, allowing us to predict outcomes. If we knowthe general direction, velocity, and rotation of an object traveling throughspace, for the most part we can predict where it’s going to end up and how longit will take. This is why we can travel from New York to Los Angeles by plane,predict how long it’s going to take to get there, and know where the plane willland.Within the understanding of Newtonian physics and this three-dimensional worldwe live in, many of us spend most of our lives focusing our attention outward ontrying to become a some one, have some body, own some things, go some where, andexperience some thing in some time. When we don’t have the things we want, weexperience lack, and lack and separation cause us to live in a state of dualityand polarity. It’s natural for us to want what we don’t have; in fact, this ishow we create things. When we experience separation from our future desires, wethink and dream of what we want and then set about performing a series ofactions in linear time to get them.If we’re always under financial stress, for example, we want money; if we have adisease, we want health; if we feel lonely, we want a relationship orcompanionship. Because of this experience of duality and separation, we aredriven to create, and this is how we naturally evolve and grow toward ourdreams. But if we are matter focused on matter trying to influence matter, toget money, health, love, and so on, as we’ve established, it’s going to takequite a bit of time and energy.When we finally attain what we were seeking, the emotion we feel from thefruition of our creation (or the meeting of those two points of consciousness)satiates the sense of lack we formerly experienced. When the new job comes, wefeel secure; when the new relationship manifests, we feel love and joy; as weheal, we feel more whole. If we are living in this state, we are waiting for“some thing” or “some one” outside of us to change how we feel internally. Oncewe feel relief from the experience of lack, because we are embracing the emotioncorrelated with the manifestation of the external event, we pay close attentionto whomever or whatever caused the relief. This cause and effect forms a newmemory, and to some degree, we evolve.When something in our world doesn’t happen, or seems to be taking a long time tohappen, we experience more lack because we feel even more separate from whatwe’re trying to create. Now our own emotional state of lack, frustration,impatience, and separation is keeping our dreams at a distance, furtherincreasing the time it will take for our desired outcome to occur.From Some Body to No Body, from Some One to No One, from Some Thing to No Thing,from Some Where to No Where, and from Some Time to No TimeIf Newtonian laws are an outward expression of the physical material laws ofspace-time—a dimension where there’s more space than time—we could say in asense that quantum laws are the inverse. The quantum is an inward expression ofthe laws of nature: an invisible field of information and energy that unifieseverything material. This immaterial field organizes, connects, and governs allthe laws of nature. It is a dimension where there’s more time than space; inother words, it’s a dimension where time is eternal.As you learned in Chapters 2 [../Text/chapter02.xhtml] and 3[../Text/chapter03.xhtml], when we take our attention off people and things atcertain places in our external world—no longer placing our attention on our bodyand ceasing to think about time and schedules—we become no body, no one, nothing, no where, and in no time. We do this through a process of disconnectingfrom our body, our identity, our gender, our disease, our name, our problems,our personal relationships, our pain, our past, and so on. This is what it meansto get beyond the self: to go from the consciousness of some body to no body,from the consciousness of some one to no one, from the consciousness of something to no thing, from the consciousness of some where to no where, and fromthe consciousness of being in some time to being in no time (see Figure 11.3).image [../Images/p282.jpg]When we take our attention off our body, our environment, and time, we getbeyond the “self”—living as a physical body, being someone as an identity,owning some things, living in some place at some time—and we become no body, noone, no thing, no where, and in no time. Now we are moving our consciousness andawareness away from the material world of Newtonian physics and toward theimmaterial world of the unified field.And take a glance at Figure 11.4.image [../Images/p283.jpg]The distinction between the two worlds of matter and energy.As we move from a narrow focus to an open focus and begin to surrender allaspects of self, we move away from the external world of people, things, places,schedules, to-do lists, and so on and turn our attention to the inner world ofenergy, vibration, frequency, and consciousness. Our research shows that when wetake our attention off objects and matter, and instead open our focus to energyand information, different parts of the brain work together in harmony. Theresult of this unification of the brain is that we feel more whole.When we do this properly, our heart begins to open, beat more rhythmically, andthus become more coherent. As the heart moves into coherence, so too does ourbrain, and because our identity is out of the way—meaning we’ve gotten beyondour body, a particular place in our known environment, and time—the act ofeliminating those things causes us to move to alpha and theta brain-wavepatterns and we connect with the autonomic nervous system. As the ANS becomesactivated, its job is to restore order and balance, causing coherence andwholeness in our heart, brain, body, and energy field. This coherence is thenreflected in all aspects of our biology.It is in this state where we begin to connect to the quantum (or unified) field.From the Illusion of Separation to the Reality of OnenessIf Newtonian physics explains the physical laws of nature and the universe on agrand scale—the gravitational force of the sun upon planets, the speed withwhich the apple falls from the tree, and so on—the quantum world deals with thefundamental nature of things at their smallest scale, such as atomic andsubatomic particles. Newtonian laws are physical constants of nature, so theNewtonian world is an objective world of measurability and predictable outcomes.Quantum laws, however, deal with the unpredictable and the unseen—the world ofenergy, waves, frequency, information, consciousness, and all spectrums oflight. Governing this world is an unseen constant—a single field of informationcalled the unified field. We can think of the Newtonian world as dealing withthe objective—where mind and matter are separate—and of the quantum world asdealing with the subjective, where mind and matter are unified by energy, orbetter yet, where mind and matter are so connected that it’s impossible toseparate the two. In the quantum or unified field, there’s no separation betweentwo points of consciousness. It is the domain of oneness, or unityconsciousness.Whereas in our three-dimensional reality space is infinite, in the quantum worldtime is infinite. If time is infinite and eternal, it’s no longer linear—meaningthere is no separation of past or future. With no past or future, everything ishappening right now, in this eternal present moment. Because time is infinite inthis time-space reality, as we move through time we experience space (orspaces).In the material world of things, when we move through space we experiencetime—yet in the immaterial quantum world of energy and frequency, the oppositeis true: * In the world of space-time, as we increase or decrease the speed with which we go from point A to point B, the time it takes to get there changes. * In the world of time-space, as we become aware of an increase or decrease in the speed of the frequency or vibration of energy, we can go from one space to another space or from one dimension to another dimension.When we collapse space, we experience time in the material reality. When wecollapse time, we experience spaces or dimensions in the immaterial reality.Each of those individual frequencies is carrying information, or a level ofconsciousness, that we experience as different realities, as we become aware ofthem. In Figure 11.5, you can see that as you move through time you experiencedifferent dimensions in the eternal present moment.image [../Images/p285.jpg]In the world of the quantum, where time is eternal, everything is happening inthe eternal present moment. As you move through time, you experience otherspace(s), other dimensions, other planes, other realities, and infinitepossibilities. Like standing between two mirrors and looking both ways atyourself into infinite dimensions, the boxes represent an infinite number ofpossible yous, all living in the present moment.In space-time, you experience the environment with your body, your senses, andtime. Time appears linear because you are separate from objects, things, people,and places—as well as the past and the future. In time-space, however, youexperience this realm with your awareness—as a consciousness, not as a body withsenses. This realm exists beyond your senses. You access this domain when youare totally in the present moment so there is no past or future, just one longnow. Since your awareness is beyond the realm of matter, because you have takenall your attention off matter, you can become aware of different frequencies allcarrying information, and these frequencies allow you to have access todifferent unknown dimensions.So if you are in a realm above the senses and unfolding as consciousness intothe energy of the unified field, you can experience many possible dimensionalrealities. (I know that this is a big bite to take in all at once, so hang inthere. If you are confused, it means you’re about to learn something new.)When I say that as you move through time you experience space or spaces, I meanall possible dimensions and possible realities. We could say, then, that in thistime-space reality, all possible spaces or dimensions exist in infinite time.This is the unified field: the realm of possibility, unknowns, and new potentialrealities, all of which exist in endless time—which is every time.Let’s think of it another way. Everybody I know is always saying that they wantor need more time to get more things accomplished. If you had more time, youcould create more experiences, do more things, and therefore get more thingsdone. This would mean more possibilities could happen and you could live more oflife.So now imagine that there was an infinite amount of time (because the past andthe future no longer exist, so time is standing still) and you had all the timeyou needed. Wouldn’t you agree that you could have endless possible experiencesand therefore could live many lives? We could say, then, that an infinite numberof experiences would be available to you equal to your imagination. To say ityet another way: * If time is eternal, then more spaces can exist in that infinite time; * If we keep elongating or making more time, it makes sense that we can fit more spaces in time; * If there is infinite time, then there are infinite spaces we can fit in time—which are endless possibilities, potential realities, dimensions, and experiences.In the quantum field, there is no separation of past or future becauseeverything that is exists in the eternal now, or the eternal present moment. Ifeverything that is exists unified or connected in the quantum field, then itsinfinite frequencies contain information about every body, every one, everything, every where, and every time. As your consciousness begins to merge withthe consciousness and energy of the unified field, you will go from theconsciousness of some body to the consciousness of no body to the consciousnessof every body; from the consciousness of some one to the consciousness of no oneto the consciousness of every one; from the consciousness of some thing to theconsciousness of no thing to the consciousness of every thing; from theconsciousness of some where to the consciousness of no where, to theconsciousness of every where; and from the consciousness of being in some timeto the consciousness of being in no time to the consciousness of being in everytime. (Take a look at Figure 11.6.)image [../Images/p287.jpg]As your consciousness merges with the consciousness of the unified field, andyou unfold deeper into it, you will become the consciousness of every body,every one, every thing, every where, in every time. In this realm, there is noseparation between two points of consciousness, which means there is onlyOneness.The Atom: Fact and FictionTo help you understand how the quantum field is constructed, you first need torevisit the possibilities that exist in the atom. When we reduce matter to itssmallest unit of measurement, we get the atom, and the atom vibrates at a veryhigh frequency. If we could peel back the atom like an orange, we’d find anucleus and subatomic particles such as protons, neutrons, and electrons, butfor the most part we’d find that it’s 99.999999999999 percent empty space, orenergy, as you read earlier.Take a look at Figure 11.7. On the left we see the classical model of the atomthat we were taught in grade school, but this is in fact an outdated model. Inactuality, electrons don’t move in fixed rotations around the nucleus likeplanets orbiting the sun. Instead, as you see on the right, the space around thenucleus is more like an invisible field, or a cloud of information—and as weknow, all information is made up of light, frequency, and energy. To get anunderstanding of just how small these subatomic particles are, if the nucleus ofan atom were increased to the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, the size of theelectron would be equal to the size of a pea. Meanwhile, the space where theelectron could exist would be 85,000 square miles—that’s twice the size of Cuba.That’s a lot of empty space for the electron to exist in.image [../Images/p288.jpg]The classical model of the atom, with electrons rotating around the centralnucleus in an orbit, is outdated. Electrons exist as waves of probability in aninvisible cloud of energy surrounding the nucleus. Therefore, the atom is mostlyimmaterial energy and very little matter.According to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, we never know where theelectron is going to appear in the electron cloud, yet from nothing comessomething. This is why quantum physics is so exciting and unpredictable: Theelectron is not always physical matter; rather, it exists as the energy or asthe probability of a wave. It is only through the act of observation by anobserver that it appears. Once an observer (mind) comes along and looks for it,the act of observation (directed energy) causes all that potential energy tocollapse into an electron (matter); thus it manifests from a realm of infinitepossibilities (an unknown) to a known. It becomes local in space and time. Whenthe observer is no longer observing it, the electron turns back intopossibility—that’s the wave function. In other words, it turns back into energy,returning to the unknown and to its own agenda. When it turns back to energy andpossibility, it becomes nonlocal. In the realm of the quantum, mind and matterare indivisible. Therefore, if Newtonian physics is the world of thepredictable, the quantum is the world of the unpredictable.When we close our eyes in meditation and open our focus to infinite space, thisis exactly what we are doing. We are putting more of our attention on energy,space, information, and possibility rather than on matter. We are becoming lessaware of the material realm and more aware of the immaterial realm. We areinvesting our energy into the unpredictable and unknown and disinvesting ourattention and energy from the predictable and the known. Each time we do this wedevelop a deeper understanding of what the unified field is.Before we go any further, let’s briefly review what we just learned. Take amoment to review Figure 11.8. The three-dimensional Newtonian world is made upof objects, people, places, matter, particles, and time (basically most of thenouns or everything we know in our external world), and in this world there’smore space than time. As a body, we use our senses to define this infinite spacewe live in—a universe of form, structure, dimension, and density. This is therealm of the known and predictable.image [../Images/p290.jpg]A summary of space-time in our 3-D Newtonian world and the bridge that allows usto enter as consciousness into the realm of time-space in our 5-D quantum world.image [../Images/p291.jpg]A summary of the time-space 5-D reality of the quantum world.Because we experience the material universe with our senses, our senses provideus with information that occurs as patterns in our brain, which we recognize asstructures, and it is through this process that things in our externalenvironment become knowns. It is also through this process that we become a somebody, a some one, with some things, in some place, and in some time. Finally,because we experience the universe with our senses, we experience separation;therefore, this is a realm of duality and polarity.Now review Figure 11.9. If the Newtonian world is a material world defined bythe senses, in the quantum world the opposite is true. This is an immaterialworld defined by non-sense; in other words, there’s nothing sensory-based here,and there is no matter. Whereas the Newtonian world is based on predictableknowns such as matter, particles, people, places, things, objects, and time,this is an unpredictable dimension made up of light, frequency, information,vibration, energy, and consciousness.If our three-dimensional world is a dimension of matter where there’s more spacethan time, the quantum world is a dimension of antimatter—a place where there’smore time than space. Because there is more time than space, all possibilitiesexist in the eternal present moment. Whereas the three-dimensional world is ouruniverse, meaning one reality, the quantum world is a multiverse, meaning manyrealities. If the space-time reality is based on separation, then the immaterialquantum world, or unified field, is based on oneness, connectedness, wholeness,and unity (nonlocality).In order for us to go from our known space-time (three-dimensional) universe, auniverse made up of matter where we experience duality and polarity, to theunknown time-space (five-dimensional) multiverse—a place where there is nomatter, but instead light, information, frequency, vibration, energy, andconsciousness—we have to cross a bridge. That bridge is the speed of light. Whenwe become pure consciousness and become no body, no one, no thing, no where intime we are crossing that threshold from matter to energy.When Einstein introduced the equation E=mc2 in his theory of special relativity,for the first time in the history of science he demonstrated from a mathematicalstandpoint that energy and matter are related. What converts matter to energy isthe speed of light—which means anything material traveling faster than the speedof light leaves our three-dimensional reality and turns into immaterial energy.In other words, in the three-dimensional world the speed of light is thethreshold for matter—or anything physical—to retain its form. No “thing” cantravel faster than the speed of light, not even information. Anything travelingfrom one point to another that is traveling slower than the speed of light isgoing to take time. Therefore, the fourth dimension is time. Time is the nexusthat connects the three-dimensional world to the fifth-dimensional world andbeyond. Once something is traveling faster than the speed of light, there is notime or no separation between two points of consciousness because every “thing”material becomes energy. This is how you go from three dimensions to fivedimensions, from a universe to the multiverse, from this dimension to alldimensions.Let me give you an example to help simplify this complex idea. French physicistAlain Aspect performed a famous quantum physics experiment in the early 1980scalled the Bell test experiments.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch11_nt1] In thestudy, scientists entangled two photons, causing them to bond together. Theythen shot the two photons in opposite directions, creating distance and spacebetween them. When they influenced one photon to disappear, the other photonvanished at exactly the same time. This experiment was a cornerstone study inthe breakthrough of quantum physics because it proved that Einstein’s theory ofrelativity wasn’t completely correct.What it showed was that there is a unifying field of information existing beyondthree-dimensional space and time that connects all matter. If the two particlesof light were not connected by some invisible field of energy, it would havetaken time for information to travel from one local point in space to the otherlocal point in space. According to Einstein’s theory, if one particledisappeared, the other particle should disappear a moment later—unless they wereoccupying the same space at the same time. Even if the second photon wasaffected a millisecond later, because they were separated by space, time wouldhave played a factor in relaying the information. This would have reaffirmedthat the ceiling of this physical reality is the speed of light and everythingmaterial that exists here is separate.Because the two particles vanished at exactly the same time, it proved that allmatter—bodies, people, things, objects, places—and even time are connected byfrequency and information in a realm beyond three-dimensional reality and time.Every “thing” beyond the material is unified in a state of oneness. Theinformation was communicated between those two photons nonlocally. Since thereis no separation between two points of consciousness in the five-dimensionalreality, there is no linear time. There is only all time(s).Mystical quantum physicist David Bohm called the realm of the quantum theimplicate order where everything is connected. He called the explicit order thematerial realm of separation.2 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch11_nt2] If you look atFigures 11.8 and 11.9 again, it will help you get your mind around both worlds.When you take your attention off being some body, some one, some thing, somewhere, in some time, and you become no body, no one, no thing, no where in notime, you are becoming pure consciousness. Your consciousness merges with theunified field—which is made only of consciousness and energy—where you connectto the self-organizing consciousness of every body, every one, every thing,every where in every time. Thus, as you surrender as an awareness (without yoursenses) into this field of oneness where there is no separation, and you keepgoing deeper into the void or blackness, because nothing physical exists there,you as a consciousness become less separate from the consciousness of theunified field. If you can keep becoming more conscious and aware of it and keeppaying attention to it, you are investing your energy in it and your attentiondirectly at it. Thus, as you keep moving toward it, you will feel lessseparation and more wholeness.Finally, since only the eternal present moment exists in the unified field,because there is no linear time (only all time), the consciousness and energy ofthe unified field that is observing all matter into form is always in thepresent eternal moment. Therefore, in order for you to connect and unify withit, you will have to be completely in the present moment as well. If you reviewFigure 11.10, it shows how you can collapse your own separation and individualconsciousness to experience the oneness and wholeness of the unified field.One last point about the speed of light. In this realm of the material world,visible light is a frequency based on polarity (electrons, positrons, photons,and so on). If you look ahead a bit at Figure 11.11, according to scale,approximately one-third of the way up from the slowest frequency is where thedivision of light takes place. Above this wave or frequency is where matter goesfrom form to energy and singularity, and below this frequency are division andpolarity. When the division of light takes place, photons, electrons, andpositrons come into being because the visible light field holds the informationtemplate of matter as organized frequency in patterns of light. This division oflight is where the Big Bang occurred—where singularity became duality andpolarity, and where the universe eventually appeared as organized informationand matter. That’s why this void is eternal blackness: There is no visiblelight.3 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch11_nt3]image [../Images/p295.jpg]The more we live with our attention on the outer world, living as a some body,being some one, owning some thing, living some where, in some time in our 3-Dreality, the more we experience separation and lack. As we move our attentionaway from the outer world and toward the inner world, into the present moment,our consciousness aligns with its consciousness; now we are present with it. Aswe surrender deeper into the unified field as a consciousness, we experienceless separation or lack and more oneness and wholeness. If there is noseparation between two points of consciousness, then there is no space and notime—but all time(s) and all space(s). Therefore, the more whole we feel and theless lack we experience, the more we feel like our future has already happened.Now we are no longer creating from duality but from oneness.Because matter vibrates at such a slow frequency, to enter the time-spacedimension or the unified field, you can’t enter as a body or matter, so you mustbecome no body. You can’t take your identity so you’re going to have to becomeno one. You can’t take things so you must become no thing. You can’t be somewhere so you’re going to have to get to no where. Finally, if you’re living by afamiliar past or predictable future where time appears linear, to get to theplace of time-space you’re going to have to experience no time. How do you dothis? You keep placing your attention on the unified field—not with your sensesbut with your awareness. As you change your consciousness, you raise yourenergy. The more you become aware of this invisible field, the more you’removing further away from the separation of matter and closer to oneness.Now you’re in the quantum, or the unified field. This is the realm ofinformation that connects every body, every one, every thing, every where, andevery time.The Unified Field: Becoming Every Body, Every One, Every Thing, Every Where, inEvery TimeMatter is very dense, and because of its density it vibrates at the slowestfrequency in the universe. In Figure 11.11, you see that as you raise matter’sfrequency by speeding it up faster and faster, matter as we know itdematerializes into energy. At some point just beyond the visible lightspectrum—above the realm of duality and polarity—any information about matterconverts to more unified energy. As you can see, the higher the frequency, themore orderly and coherent that energy becomes. At this level of frequency andenergy, duality and polarity unify to become one. We call this love, orwholeness, because there is no longer any division or separation. It is wherepositive and negative join; where male and female unite; where the past andfuture merge; where good and bad no longer exist; where right and wrong nolonger apply; where opposites become one.As you continue up this scale away from matter and separation, you continue toexperience greater and greater degrees of wholeness, order, and love. Theorderliness of this more coherent energy is carrying information and thatinformation is more and more love. If you continued speeding matter up evenfaster, eventually it would be vibrating so fast as a frequency that it wouldexist as a straight line. Infinite frequencies exist in that line, which meansinfinite possibilities exist there as well. This is the zero-point field, or thepoint of singularity of the quantum—an omnipresent, ubiquitous field ofinformation that exists as energy and frequency that is observing all of realityinto order from a single point. We could call this the mind of God, unityconsciousness, source energy, or whatever nomenclature you want to use to definethe self-organizing principle of the universe. This is the place where allpotentials or possibility exists as a thought—the ultimate source of a lovingintelligence and an intelligent love that is observing all of this physicalreality into form. Therefore:image [../Images/p297.jpg]Everything starts from a conscious thought. As conscious thought slows down infrequency, it slows down in energy until ultimately it takes on form and becomesmatter.At the frequency of the speed of light, the pattern of all matter is reflectedas a template to become structure. It is at the speed of light that energydivides into polarity or duality and electrons and positrons, etc., are created.Above the speed of light, there are greater degrees of order that are reflectedas greater degrees of wholeness.As we journey in consciousness from matter and get beyond ourselves, turning ourattention inward toward the unified field, once we cross the plane of visiblelight, we become no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time. It is in thisrealm that we experience as an awareness of other dimensions, other realities,and other possibilities. Since frequency carries information and there areinfinite frequencies in the quantum, we can experience other planes that existthere.If you look at the arrows moving from matter toward the unified field—the topstraight line—representing all possibilities, you will see that you must journeythrough the lower frequencies between matter and light, which are differentlevels of thoughts and emotions. Look at the different levels of consciousnessthat you have to pass through to arrive at oneness and you will understand whymost never make the journey. * The greater the frequency we experience, the greater the energy; * The greater the energy, the greater the information we have access to; * The greater the information, the greater the consciousness; * The greater the consciousness, the greater the awareness; * The greater the awareness, the greater the mind; * The greater the mind, the greater ability we have to affect matter.In the hierarchy of universal laws, quantum laws trump Newtonian (or classical)laws. This is why Einstein said, “The field is the sole governing agency of theparticle,” for the quantum field governs, organizes, and unifies all the laws ofnature and is always directing energy into order by patterning light into form.On our own planet, we need only look at nature to see how Fibonacci’s sequence,otherwise known as the golden ratio (a recurring mathematical formula foundthroughout nature that brings about order and coherence) brings order to matter.It’s the zero-point field made of possibilities or thought (because thoughts arepossibilities) that is slowing its frequency down, creating order and form.The unified field is a self-organizing intelligence that is always observing thematerial world into order and form. The more you can surrender to it, movecloser to it, and become one with it, the less separation and lack you feel andthus the more wholeness and oneness you experience. When you as an awarenessunfold into this infinite realm of possibilities, you begin to feel connected tothe consciousness of every one, every body, every where, every thing, in everytime—including your future dreams. Since consciousness is awareness andawareness is paying attention, the first step to experiencing the unified fieldis to become aware of it, because if you’re not aware of it, it doesn’t exist.Thus, the more you pay attention to this field, the more you will become awareof it.There is a caveat, however. As we’ve seen, the only way you can enter the realmof pure consciousness is to become pure consciousness; in other words, the onlyway to enter this kingdom of thought is as a thought. This means you have to getbeyond your senses by taking your awareness off matter and particles, andinstead place it on energy or the wave. If you can unfold as an awareness intothis unseen, immaterial realm of infinite blackness and become aware that youare an awareness in the presence of a greater awareness, your consciousness willmerge with a greater consciousness.If you can do this, if you can get out of the way and linger as a consciousnessor awareness in this field, if you can keep surrendering to this intelligentlove—the same innate intelligence that’s creating the universe and giving youlife—it’s going to consume you. This loving intelligence is both personal anduniversal, within you and all around you, and when it consumes you it’s going tocreate and restore order and balance in your biology because its very nature isto organize matter in a more coherent way. Now you are moving through the eye ofthe needle, and on the other side of the eye there is no longer the separationof two points of consciousness. There is one consciousness—or oneness. This iswhere all possibilities exist.Because you are entering the domain of consciousness, thought, information,energy, and frequency, the bridge that gets you from space-time to time-space isgoing from being some body, some one, some thing, in some place, in some time,to being no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time. This is the nexus—thethreshold to the unified or quantum field (go back and review Figures 11.8 and11.9).In this realm of infinite unknown possibilities, unlimited new potentials andexperiences await you—not the same old familiar ones that you’ve experiencedtime and time again. After all, isn’t that what the unknown is? An unknown isjust a possibility that exists to you as a new thought. When you are in thisrealm of pure thought as a thought, the only thing limiting you is yourimagination. But when in this realm of thought, if you find yourself thinkingagain about some one, some thing, some body, some where, in some known time,your awareness (and thus your energy) is back in the known reality ofthree-dimensional space and time—back to the realm of separation.Since every thought you think has a frequency, the moment you start thinkingabout the pain in your body, or the advancement of your disease, or the problemsat work, or the issues you have with your mother, or the things you must dowithin a certain amount of time, you are back in this space and time. Yourawareness is back in the realm of the material world, and your thoughts areproducing the same frequency equal to matter and particles (review Figure11.10). Your energy is back to vibrating at the same level of the known physicalworld of three-dimensional reality, so you exert less of an effect on yourpersonal reality. You are back to vibrating as matter, and we know how thatgoes.As your frequency moves further and further into density, you are moving furtherand further away from the unified field; as a result, you feel separate from it.In this scenario, if your dreams exist as thoughts in the unified field, it’sgoing to take a lot of time for your dreams to come true.If you are thinking about some body, some one, some thing, at some place, insome time, you are not getting beyond your identity, which has been shaped bythe totality of your past experiences. You are literally still in the samememories, habitual thoughts, and conditioned emotions that you’ve associatedwith all the familiar people and things at certain times and places in yourknown reality—which means your attention and energy are bound to yourpast-present personal reality. You’re thinking equal to your identity, so yourlife is going to stay the same. You’re the same personality trying to create anew personal reality.When I say you have to get beyond yourself, it means to forget about yourself—take your attention off your personality and your past-personal reality. Itmakes sense, then, that to heal your body, you’re going to have to get beyondyour body. To create something new in your life, you’re going to have to forgetabout your same old life. To change some problem in your external environment,you’re going to have to get beyond your memory and the corresponding emotionsrelated to that problem. And if you want to create a new, unexpected event inyour future timeline, you’ll have to stop unconsciously anticipating the samepredictable future based on your familiar memories of the past. You are going tohave to move to a greater level of consciousness than the consciousness thatcreated any of those realities.In the unified field there is no where to go because you are every where; thereis no thing you can want because you are so whole and complete that you feellike you have every thing; you can’t judge any one because you are every one;and it’s no longer necessary to become any body because you are every body. Andwhy would you be worried that there is never enough time if you exist in adomain where there’s infinite time?The more whole you feel the less lack you experience, and therefore the less youwant. How can you want, or live in lack, when you feel whole? If there is lesslack, there is less of the need to create from duality, polarity, andseparation. How can you want when you’re whole? When you create from wholeness,you feel like you already have it. There is no longer wanting, trying, wishing,forcing, predicting, fighting, or hoping—after all, hope is a beggar. When youcreate from a state of wholeness, there are only knowing and observing. This isthe key to manifesting reality: being connected, not separate.If time in your three-dimensional world is created by the illusion of spacebetween two objects or two points of consciousness, then the more one you arewith the unified field, the less separation there is between you and everythingmaterial. When your consciousness merges or becomes more connected to theunified field—to the realm of wholeness and unity—there is no longer separationbetween two points of consciousness. This wholeness is then reflected in yourbiology, chemistry, circuitry, hormones, genes, heart, and brain, thus restoringbalance to your entire system. A greater frequency or energy is now movingthrough your autonomic nervous system—a system that continuously gives you lifeand whose agenda it is to create balance and order. This energy is carrying amessage of wholeness, and as a result you become more holy. The greater thefrequency you experience, the shorter amount of time it takes to unfold in thisthree-dimensional space-time reality.As we learned earlier in this chapter, when you diminish the space between twopoints of consciousness, you collapse time. When this illusion of separation nolonger exists, you perceive less space between you (an identity, living in abody, in a physical environment, in linear time) and people, objects, things,places, matter, and even your dreams. Therefore, the closer you move to theunified field, the more connected you feel you are to every one and every thing.You as a consciousness are in the realm of oneness, and because there is noseparation, time is eternal. And remember: When there is infinite time, thereare infinite spaces, possible dimensions, and realities to be experienced.Wherever you “think” you are, or whoever you “think” you are, you are. In fact,there is nothing to try to create because it already exists as a thought in therealm of all thoughts. All you have to do is to become aware of it and observeit into being by experiencing it.image [../Images/p302.jpg]Once we become the consciousness of every one, every body, every thing, everywhere, in every time . . . from a theoretical standpoint, we can create anybody, become any one, have any thing, live any where, and be in any time.Take a peek at Figure 11.12 to follow along. As you do this and move yourattention from being some body, to being no body, to becoming every body, youcan create any body. As you move from living as some one, to becoming no one, tobeing every one, you can become any one. As you can take your attention off something, move into the realm of no thing, you merge with every thing, thus you canhave any thing. As you move your awareness from some where, to no where, youwill be every where, and you can live any where. And finally, when you shiftyour consciousness from some time, to no time, to become every time, you can bein any time.Now that’s becoming supernatural.In the work I do around the world, I have labored for many years teaching ourstudents how to get beyond themselves. I now know the first step in this processis for them to master their body, get beyond the conditions in their externalenvironment, and transcend time. When they accomplish that, they find themselveson the precipice of experiencing the unified field. Once they arrive at thisnexus, however, they must be taught that there is even more to experience.If learning means making new synaptic connections, the more you learn aboutsomething the more you can appreciate it, become aware of it, and experience itbecause now you can engage it with a new set of neural networks. It is in theact of learning that you further change or enrich your experience, after all—ifyou haven’t learned anything new, your experience will probably stay the samesince you’re perceiving reality with the same neural circuitry as before.Knowledge is the harbinger that evolves your experience.For example, I love red wine and I lead several wine tours a year in differentparts of the world. Many people who come to these week-long events initiallytell me that they “know” nothing about wine. How I translate this statement isthat they probably never learned anything about, or have had limited exposureto, the fermented grape. The truth of the matter is that because they havelimited knowledge and experience from their past, they have very limited neuralhardware installed to perceive any real taste or nuance. We could say, then,that they just don’t know what to look for to truly enjoy the experience.But what if they learn how winemakers produce wine and understand its history,the type of grapes they use, and why they are used? Then they learn about howthe wine is stored in oak barrels, for how long, and why. This would familiarizethem with the whole process and reasoning as to what makes a particular wine soenjoyable.That’s the process, but now think of that great wine in the bottle. If they arenot aware of the plum flavor, the notes of black cherry and currants, its hintsof vanilla and leather, the smell of its floral perfumes, its percentage oftannins, and whether it was aged in oak barrels or stainless steel drums, andfor how long, then they don’t know what to look for and they are not going to beable to fully experience it. Only in the moment when they know what to look forand what to become aware of does it exist. We could say, then, that theirawareness changes their experience.I know this to be true because in just one week those same people who initiallysaid they didn’t like red wine or knew nothing about it walk away with a wholenew experience of interacting with it. After many full days of learning anddiscovering what to look for—repeatedly staying present and focusing all theirawareness on specific flavors and aromas, day after day experiencing all typesof wines and deciding what they like and don’t like, continuously payingattention and therefore firing, wiring, and assembling new neuralconnections—those folks get very specific about what type of wine they like. Inone week, they gain a whole new level of appreciation, awareness, andunderstanding. Again, the experience changed them. The same is true when itcomes to the unified field. If you are not aware of it, then it doesn’t existfor you, yet the more you know about it and the more aware you are of what tolook for, the more you can pay attention to it with your awareness andexperience it more deeply. And it should change you.Starting at birth, you’re trained to keep your attention on matter and not onenergy. You are conditioned into believing you need your senses to experiencereality; in other words, if you don’t see, hear, feel, smell, touch, or tastesomething, it doesn’t exist. Because of this, the majority of people place mostof their attention on matter, objects, and the particle, while taking verylittle time to put their attention on energy, information, and the wave. Forinstance, you are not aware of your big toe on your left foot until you put yourattention on it. It has always existed for you but you were unaware of it. Themoment you put your awareness on it, however, it comes into being. The same istrue for the unified field. The more you become aware of it, the more it willexist in your reality. By focusing solely on matter, people exclude possibilityfrom their life. That’s what the wave is—an energy of possibility. The more youpay attention to it, the more possibilities should show up in your life.Because wherever you place your attention is where you place your energy, themoment you become aware of the unified field, your attention upon it causes itto expand. For example, when you place your attention and awareness on yourpain, it expands, because you experience more of it. If you keep attending toyour pain and experiencing more and more of it, it becomes a part of your life.The same thing also happens with the unified field; when you place yourattention on it and become more aware of it, it expands. And just as I saidabout pain, when you experience more of it, it exists as a part of your life.Simply by placing your attention on the unified field—as you become aware of it,notice it, experience it, feel it, interact with it, and stay present with itmoment after moment—it shows up and unfolds in your reality on a daily basis.How does it show up and unfold? As unknowns: serendipities, synchronicities,opportunities, coincidences, luck, being in the right place at the right time,and moments filled with awe.In my best description from experience, this unified field is a divine, lovingintelligence and an intelligent love that is within and around you, so each timeyou focus your attention on it, you are becoming aware of the presence of thedivine within and all around you. As you place your attention on it, the divineshould appear more in your life. Since consciousness is awareness and awarenessis paying attention, when you are aware of it and pay attention to it, you beginto merge with it. Your experience of it will literally cause you to become it,and as you unfold deeper and deeper into this unified field, there’s more andmore for you to explore and experience.If you look at Figure 11.11 again, as you move closer and closer to thatstraight line that represents Source energy or oneness, it makes sense that theonly way you can move closer to it is by keeping your attention on it andbecoming more conscious of it. If you do this correctly, as you journey awayfrom duality or separation and toward unity and oneness, since feelings are theend product of experience, you should feel more and more levels of love, unity,and wholeness. Once you feel and experience more of this intelligent love, threethings happen in your life.The first thing that happens is that as you place your attention and awarenesson the unified field, as you move closer to Source and deeper into it, youexperience more of it. That journey carves a neurological path from yourthinking brain straight to your autonomic nervous system. Now each time youventure deeper into it, as you slow your brain waves down, you’re building aneurological highway with more lanes, and that neuro-pathway becomes thickerbecause you are using it more. Over time, this enables you to more easily mergewith the field.The second thing that happens is that because experience enriches the brain,each time you interact with this unified field and experience it, your brainchanges. This is what experience does; it enriches and refines brain circuitry.Now you are installing the hardware in your brain to be more aware of this fieldthe next time you merge with it. Likewise, since experience produces an emotion,as you feel the unified field you begin to embody it; thus you embody more ofthe divine.According to the quantum model of reality, since all disease is a lowering andincoherency of frequency, the moment the body experiences this new coherentelevated frequency, the energy from that event raises the body’s vibration intocoherence and order. Numerous times in our advanced workshops around the world,when our students’ bodies have been upgraded by a new frequency and newinformation, we’ve witnessed instantaneous changes in their health.Since the autonomic nervous system’s agenda is to create balance and health, theinstant we get out of its way, stop analyzing, cease thinking, and fullysurrender, this intelligence steps in and creates order. But this time it’scarrying a newer, more self-organizing message with a greater frequency from theunified field. That very same coherent energy raises the frequency of matter.It’s like changing the frequency of a static-filled radio station to one that iscarrying a clear frequency and signal. The body is receiving a more coherentsignal.When this happens you will feel intense love, a profound joy for existence, aheightened sense of freedom, indescribable bliss, an awe for life, elevatedlevels of gratitude, and a humbled sense of true empowerment. In that moment,the energy from the unified field—in the form of emotion—is reconditioning yourbody to a new consciousness and a new mind. In a heartbeat, the elevatedemotions signal new genes in new ways, changing your body and moving it out ofyour biological past.The third thing that happens as you move closer toward the unified field is thatyou begin to hear or experience knowledge and information differently. That’sbecause you’ve changed your brain’s circuits and are no longer the same person.You will meet truth on a whole new level, and things that you thought you knewwill seem like a brand-new encounter. Your inner experience has changed yourperception of what is happening in your outer world. In other words, you’veawakened.Once you have an experience, a feeling, or a better understanding of the unifiedfield—once it changes your brain’s circuitry—it allows you to experience andperceive reality in new ways. In fact, you will see a spectrum of life that yourbrain did not have the circuitry to perceive before. The next time your brainfires those networks, you already have the hardware to experience even more ofthe reality. You are now perceiving more of a reality that has always existed;you merely lacked the circuits to perceive it previously.If on a consistent basis you can make this journey all the way to Source (seeFigure 11.11 again) and connect with it, the moment you truly interact with it,you will begin to behave more like it. Its nature becomes your nature, and nowmore intelligent love is being expressed through you. What are its innatequalities? You will become more patient, forgiving, present, conscious, aware,willful, giving, selfless, loving, and mindful, to name but a few of them. Yourealize that which you have been seeking is seeking you. You become it, and itbecomes you.The discipline, then, is to: * Allow your consciousness to merge with a greater consciousness; * Surrender deeper into intelligent love; * Trust in the unknown; * Continuously surrender some aspect of the limited self to join the greater self; * Lose yourself in nothing to become everything; * Relax into an infinite deep sea of coherent energy; * Keep unfolding deeper and deeper into oneness; * Continuously let go of control; * Feel greater and greater degrees of wholeness, and finally; * As a consciousness, moment by moment become aware, pay attention to, experience, be present with, and feel more and more of this unified field all around you—without returning your awareness back to three-dimensional reality.If you do this properly, you won’t be using any of your senses because you’rebeyond your senses. You’ll simply be awareness.Space-Time, Time-Space MeditationBegin by resting your awareness on your heart, and once you are locked in on thespace your heart occupies in space, become aware of your breathing. Allow it toflow in and out of your heart, all the while deepening and relaxing your breath.Keeping your attention on your heart, call up an elevated emotion and sustainthis feeling for a period of time while paying attention to your breathing.Radiate that energy beyond your body in space.Next, using any song that inspires you (like the one you used for the meditationin Chapter 5 [../Text/chapter05.xhtml]), do that meditation to pull the mind outof the body. Take all the energy stored in your body as survival emotions andliberate it into elevated emotions, using a level of intensity that is greaterthan the body as the mind.For the next 10 to 15 minutes, listen to one or two songs (without lyrics) thatwill induce trance. Now become pure consciousness, becoming no one, no body, nothing, no where, in no time, unfolding as an awareness into the unified field.Now it’s time to become connected to the consciousness of every one, every body,every thing, every where, in every time, unifying with a greater consciousnessin the unified field. All you have to do is become aware of this field, payattention to it, stay present with it, and feel it moment by moment. You willbegin to feel more wholeness and oneness, which will be reflected in yourbiology because your body is experiencing more coherent energy moving through itand you are building your energy field. Maintain this state for about 10 to 20minutes, surrendering deeper and deeper into it. When you’re done, bring yourawareness back to a new body, to a new environment, and to a whole new time."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 12 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t12]image [../Images/line.jpg]THE PINEAL GLAND [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t12]image [../Images/line.jpg]As you now know, when we as a consciousness move beyond the world of the sensesin this three-dimensional reality, we can tap into frequencies that carryspecific information beyond the vibration of matter and the speed of light. Whenthis happens, the brain processes extremely high amplitudes of energy. Time andtime again, we’ve measured and observed this phenomenon in our advancedstudents’ brain scans. You’ve also learned that when there is an increase inenergy in the brain, there will always be an increase in consciousness andawareness—and vice versa. In fact, it’s very difficult to determine whether itis the energy or the level of consciousness that causes these extrememeasurements. But I don’t think we can separate the two because you cannot havea change in energy without a change in consciousness, or a change in frequencywithout a change in information.As you connect to deeper levels of the unified field, the brain is activated bya greater energy that carries specific information in the form of thoughts andimagery. The brain then literally tracks and records this profound inner event,and to the person having the experience, whatever is happening in their mindseems more real than any past external event. In that moment, the increasedenergy in the form of a profoundly powerful emotion captures all the mind’sattention. This is the instant the brain and body receive a biological upgrade.If someone can sit in a chair with their eyes closed during meditation and havea significantly heightened sensory experience without their senses, it begs thequestion What is happening in the brain to explain this supernatural effect? Tothe person having the experience, despite the fact that they are sitting still,it seems more real than any other experience (determined by their senses) thatthey’ve ever had. This begs more inquiry: How can we have a fully amplifiedsensory experience without our senses? What are the specific functions of thebrain and body that translate interactions with the quantum field into profoundinner experiences?In other words, if we can interface with a more coherent field of information,which then creates such stimulating inner events, there must be a neurological,chemical, and biological explanation for such supernatural occurrences. What arethe unique systems, organs, glands, tissues, chemicals, neurotransmitters, andcells involved that could give rise to such intensely profound experiences?Could there be physiological components that are just sitting dormant, waitingto be activated?Four states of consciousness will help provide a framework for the informationin this chapter. The first is wakefulness, which of course is when we are awareand conscious. Next is sleep, where we are unconscious and the body is restoringand repairing. Then comes dreaming, which is an altered state of consciousnesswhen the body is catatonic but our minds are engaged in inner visual imagery andsymbolism. And finally there are transcendental moments of consciousness thatare beyond our understanding of reality. These transcendent events seem tochange us and the way we look at the world forever. I want to give you my bestunderstanding about the biology, chemistry, and neuroscience of thosetranscendental experiences. Let’s start with the molecule melatonin, which isresponsible for all of this.Melatonin: The Dreaming NeurotransmitterWhen you wake up in the morning and return to the world of the senses, themoment your eye perceives light through your iris, receptors in the optic nervesend a signal to a part of your brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Itthen sends a signal to the pineal gland, which responds by making serotonin, thedaytime neurotransmitter.As you will recall, neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that transmit andcommunicate information between nerve cells. The neurotransmitter serotonintells your body it’s time to wake up and start your day. As you integrateinformation between all your senses in order to create meaning between yourinner and outer world, serotonin stimulates your brain waves from delta to thetato alpha to beta, causing you to once again realize you’re in a physical body inspace and time. Thus, when your brain is firing in beta brain waves, you putmuch of your attention on your outer environment, your body, and time. That’snormal.As night falls and it gets dark, a similar but inverse process occurs. Theinhibition of light sends a signal along the same route back to the pinealgland, but now the pineal gland transmutes serotonin into melatonin, thenighttime neurotransmitter. This production and release of melatonin slows downyour brain waves from beta to alpha, making you sleepy, tired, and less likelyto want to think or analyze. As your brain waves slow down to alpha, you becomemore interested in returning your attention to your inner world rather than yourouter world. Eventually, as your body falls asleep and goes into a catatonicstate, your brain waves move from alpha to theta to delta, thus inducing periodsof dreaming as well as deep, restorative sleep.By living within the rhythm of our external environment, within this diurnalpattern of wakefulness and sleep (based on where we live in the world), ourbrain becomes automatically entrained to the daily production of these chemicalsat very specific times in the morning and evening. This is called the circadianrhythm. Most of us know that when we move out of this natural rhythm we becomeout of sorts, such as when we travel to another part of the world where the sunrises and sets several hours ahead of our normal time zone. This is jet lag, andwe need some time to recalibrate. When the body gets out of its naturalcircadian rhythm, it will usually take a few days to readjust to the newenvironment’s rhythm of sunrise and sunset. This is all chemistry produced fromour interaction with our external three-dimensional world—from our eyes’reaction to the sun and the frequency of visible light.Melatonin induces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a phase of the circadianrhythm that causes dreaming. As the thoughts and chatter in our head diminish,giving way to sleep and eventually the dreaming state, the brain begins tointernally see and perceive in images, pictures, and symbols. But before we getinto why melatonin is so important, let’s take a closer look at the molecularstructure of this dreaming neurotransmitter.The process of creating melatonin starts with the essential amino acidL-tryptophan, the raw material responsible for making serotonin and melatonin.To be converted into melatonin, it must pass through a series of chemicalchanges known as methylation. Methylation is the process of taking a singlecarbon and three hydrogens (known as a methyl group) and applying it tocountless critical functions throughout our body such as thinking, repairingDNA, turning genes on and off, fighting infections, and so on. In this case,it’s part of the production of melatonin.In Figure 12.1, we see methylation in action. Because this methyl group is madeup of very stable chemicals, the basic structure of the five- and six-sidedrings stay the same during this series of chemical reactions. However, asdifferent groups of molecules attach to those rings, they change the propertiesand characteristics of the molecule.Beginning with L-tryptophan, the pineal gland transmutes it into5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), which then becomes serotonin. Serotonin is a morestable molecule than 5-HTP, can sustain itself in the brain, and has a moreuseful function, as we’ll soon see. Through another chemical reaction, thepineal gland converts serotonin into N-acetylserotonin and then an additionalreaction turns it into melatonin. And all of this happens in the pineal gland.In a 24-hour cycle, the production of melatonin is highest between the hours of1 A.M. and 4 A.M. This is important to remember.image [../Images/p312.jpg]The methylation process of the amino acid L-tryptophan into serotonin andmelatonin.We now know there’s an inverse relationship between our adrenal hormones andmelatonin. As adrenal cortisol levels go up, melatonin levels go down. This isthe reason why we can’t sleep when we’re under stress. In antiquity, this servedas a biological safety mechanism. For instance, if you were chased by a predatora few times on the way to the watering hole, and then you spotted more largebeasts in your territory, your body, in its innate intelligence, would want toprevent you from becoming prey yourself. In such cases, sleep and restorationbecome less important than surviving. More aptly put—staying alive by remainingawake through the night is more valuable than sleeping and risking death.When the body is trying to rest in this vigilant state, it never gets therestorative sleep it needs because the survival chemicals, like cortisol, haveswitched on the survival genes. If the perceived stressor is not a saber-toothedtiger, but instead your strained relationship with your ex-spouse, whom you mustinteract with daily, that chronic stress keeps the survival system activated.Now this safety valve is no longer adaptive but maladaptive. This type ofchronic stress alters typical levels of melatonin (and even serotonin), knockingthe body out of homeostasis.But if you lower the levels of cortisol, melatonin levels will increase. Inother words, when you break the stress response by overcoming the emotionaladdiction to those chemicals, your body can go back to long-term buildingprojects instead of constantly dealing with the perceived emergency. Take a lookat Figure 12.2 to review the relationship between melatonin and cortisol.image [../Images/p313.jpg]As stress hormones go up, melatonin levels go down. As stress hormones go down,melatonin levels go up.image [../Images/p314.jpg]A chart showing some of the benefits of melatonin.Melatonin has many other interesting applications. For example, it’s been provento improve carbohydrate metabolism. This is important because when certainpeople respond to stress, the body takes carbohydrates and stores them asfat—and fat is nothing more than stored energy. This is a result of primitivegenes signaling the body to store energy in case there’s a famine. Melatonin hasalso been known to help with depression. It’s even been proven to increaselevels of DHEA, the anti-aging hormone. For more facts about the importance ofmelatonin, the dreaming neurotransmitter, see Figure 12.3.1[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt1]Now let’s deepen your understanding of all the information you’ve been studyingin this book up until this point.Activating the Pineal GlandFor years, I spent enormous amounts of time studying the pineal gland andseeking researchers who did extensive measurements of its metabolites andtissue. My interest was in tying together my findings with some ancientmysteries. One abstract in particular piqued my interest:The pineal gland is a neuroendocrine transducer secreting melatonin responsiblefor physiological circadian rhythm control. A new form of bio-mineralization hasbeen studied in the human pineal gland and consists of small crystals that areless than 20 microns in length. These crystals are responsible forelectromechanical, biological transduction mechanism in the pineal gland due tothe structure and piezoelectric properties.2 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt2]That’s a lot of words to digest, but let’s break it down into two meaningfulpoints. The key words here (in reverse order) are piezoelectric properties andtransducer.The piezoelectric effect occurs when you apply pressure to certain materials andthat mechanical stress is changed into an electrical charge. To put it in simpleterms, the pineal gland contains calcite crystals made of calcium, carbon, andoxygen, and because of their structure, they express this effect. Like anantenna, the pineal gland has the capacity to become electrically activated andgenerate electromagnetic fields that can tune in to information. That’s pointnumber one. In addition, in the same way an antenna pulsates a rhythm orfrequency to match the frequency of an incoming signal, the pineal glandreceives information carried on invisible electromagnetic fields. Since allfrequency carries information, once the antenna connects to the exact signal ofthe electromagnetic field, there must be a way to convert and descramble thatsignal into a meaningful message. That’s exactly what a transducer does—andthat’s the second point.A transducer is anything that receives a signal in the form of one type ofenergy and converts it into a signal in another form. Take a moment to lookaround you. The space you are sitting in is filled with TV, radio, and Wi-Fiwaves that are all different frequency ranges of invisible electromagneticenergy. (You can’t see any of them with your eyes, but they’re still there.) Forexample, the antenna that picks up a range of frequencies carrying a signal toyour TV is transduced into a picture on your TV screen. When you tune in to anFM station, you are tuning your antenna to a specific electromagnetic frequency.The information carried in that frequency range is then transduced into acoherent signal, which is the music you hear with your ears.The study I quoted says the pineal gland is a neuroendocrine transducer, capableof receiving and converting signals within the brain. When the pineal gland actsas a transducer, it can pick up frequencies above our three-dimensionalspace-time, sensory-based reality. Once the pineal gland is activated, it cantune in to higher dimensions of this space and time—which we learned in theprevious chapter is the realm of time-space. And like a TV, it can then turn theinformation carried on those frequencies into vivid imagery and surreal, lucid,transcendental experiences in our mind, including profoundly heightenedmultisensory visions beyond our vocabulary. This is a bit like experiencing amultidimensional IMAX movie.At this point, you may be wondering, Since this little gland exists inside myskull, how am I going to exert mechanical stress on the crystals in it, create apiezoelectric effect, and activate the pineal gland so it becomes like anantenna? And how will that antenna pick up frequencies and information beyondmatter and light so that it can transduce those electromagnetic signatures intomeaningful imagery, like a transcendental experience beyond thisthree-dimensional reality?For the pineal gland to become activated, four important things must happen. Iwill address three of them now, and then I will give you the fourth step whenit’s time to learn the meditation.1. The Piezoelectric EffectCritical to creating the piezoelectric effect in the pineal gland are thecalcite crystals mentioned above and shown in Figure 12.4. Remember, these arevery tiny crystals, approximately 1 to 20 microns in length. To put this incontext, their size can range anywhere from one-hundredth to one-quarter thewidth of a human hair. For the most part they are octahedron, hexahedron, andrhombohedron in shape.As we already learned in Chapter 5 [../Text/chapter05.xhtml], the purpose of thebreathing technique we do before many meditations is to pull the mind out of thebody by liberating potential energy (stored as emotions) in the lower threeenergy centers. As we inhale and contract those intrinsic muscles, follow ourbreath from the perineum all the way up our spine to the top of our head, andthen hold our breath and squeeze those muscles more, we’re increasingintrathecal pressure. As I mentioned earlier in the book, this is the internalpressure created when you push up against your insides—for example, when youhold your breath and lift something heavy.The word piezoelectric is derived from the Greek words piezein, which means “tosqueeze or press,” and piezo, which means to “push.” So it’s no coincidence thatI ask you to hold your breath and squeeze those intrinsic muscles. When you dothis, you are pushing cerebrospinal fluid up against the pineal gland, exertingmechanical stress on it. This mechanical stress translates into an electricalcharge, and it’s this exact action that compresses the stacked crystals in thepineal gland and creates a piezoelectric effect: The crystals of the pinealgland generate an electric charge in response to the stress you’re applying.image [../Images/p317.jpg]A picture of a calcite crystal found in the pineal gland.One of the unique characteristics of the piezoelectric effect is that it’sreversible, meaning that the materials exhibiting the direct piezoelectriceffect (the crystals) also exhibit a converse piezoelectric effect. Once thecrystals in the gland are compressed and are creating an electrical charge, theelectromagnetic field that is emanating from the pineal gland causes thecrystals in it to stretch as the field increases. When the crystals generatingthe electromagnetic field reach their limit and can stretch no further, theycontract and the electromagnetic field reverses direction and moves inwardtoward the pineal gland. When the electromagnetic field reaches the pineal glandcrystals, it compresses them again, producing yet another electromagnetic field.This cycle of expanding and reversing the field perpetuates a pulsatingelectromagnetic field.image [../Images/p318.jpg]When we inhale through our nose, and at the same time squeeze our intrinsicmuscles, we accelerate the cerebrospinal fluid into the brain. As we follow themovement of energy to the top of our head, then hold our breath and squeeze, weare increasing intrathecal pressure. The increased pressure moves thecerebrospinal fluid from the fourth ventricle through a small canal into thethird ventricle (arrows). At the same time, fluid traveling around thecerebellum (arrows) compresses the crystals of the pineal gland. The mechanicalstress that is applied produces an electrical charge in the pineal gland,creating a piezoelectric effect.It’s no wonder, then, that I ask you to hold your breath, squeeze, and contractthose muscles—and it’s no surprise that I insist you repeat this process overand over. As you keep doing the breath and holding and squeezing again andagain, with every cycle of breathing you are activating the piezoelectricproperties of the pineal gland. The more you do this, the more you speed up thecycles per second of the expansion and contraction of this electromagneticfield, making the pulses get faster and faster. Now the pineal gland becomes apulsating antenna, capable of picking up subtler and subtler, fasterelectromagnetic frequencies.Take a close look at Figure 12.5. We talked about the movement of cerebrospinalfluid during the breath in Chapter 5 [../Text/chapter05.xhtml], but let’s buildon the teaching. As the fluid enters the brain, it moves up through the centralcanal, through the space between the spinal column and the spinal cord. Fromthis juncture, it flows in two directions. First, the fluid moves into thefourth ventricle, followed by the third ventricle. As the fluid travels from thefourth to the third ventricle, it passes through a narrow path or channel, andnestled right at the back of the third ventricle rests what looks like a tinypinecone (that’s what pineal means). This is the pineal gland, and it’s aboutthe size of a large grain of rice. Second, the cerebrospinal fluid also flowsaround the back of the cerebellum to the other side of the pinealgland—surrounding the entire gland with pressurized fluid.By increasing the intrathecal pressure, you funnel a greater volume of fluidinto the chamber of the third ventricle as well as from the space around thecerebellum. So when you hold your breath and squeeze, this extra volume of fluidexerts pressure from both directions up against the crystals, causing them tocompress and create the piezoelectric effect. This is the first event that musttake place to activate the pineal gland.2. The Pineal Gland Releases Its MetabolitesCerebrospinal fluid moves through a closed system called the ventricular system(review Figure 12.5). The ventricular system facilitates the movement of thisfluid from the base of the spine, up through the spinal column, through the fourchambers of the brain (called aqueducts or ventricles), and back down to thesacrum (the base of the spine). When you inhale and follow your breath to thetop of your head and then hold your breath and squeeze up and in, you areaccelerating the cerebrospinal fluid.On the surface of the pineal gland are tiny hairs called cilia, Latin for“eyelashes” (see Figure 12.6). The action of the accelerated fluid moving fasterthan normal through the chambers of the ventricular system tickles the tinyhairs, which overstimulates the pineal gland. Because the pineal gland is shapedlike a phallus, the stimulation produced by the acceleration of fluid movingpast it, combined with the electrical activation created by an increase inintrathecal pressure in a closed system, causes the gland to ejaculate some veryprofound, upgraded metabolites of melatonin into the brain. You’re now one stepcloser to activating the pineal gland and having a transcendental experience.image [../Images/p320.jpg]The tiny cilia of the pineal gland become stimulated as the cerebrospinal fluidaccelerates through the ventricular system.3. Energy Is Delivered Directly to the BrainMuch like sending a rocket ship into space, overcoming gravity to get it off theground is the part that requires the most energy, so to move that energy fromour lower centers demands a great deal of intensity and effort. The breathbecomes our passionate intention to free ourselves from the self-limitingemotions of our past. The spinal column becomes the delivery mechanism for thisenergy, and the top of the head becomes the target.As you know by now, every time you perform the breath, you send chargedparticles up the spinal column. As these particles increase in velocity andacceleration, they create what’s known as an inductance field (see Figure 12.7).This inductance field reverses the flow of two-way information that typicallyfacilitates communication from the brain to the body and the body to the brain.Much like a vacuum, the inductance field draws the energy from those lowercenters—energy involved with orgasm, consumption, digestion, fight-or-flightstress, and control—and delivers it directly to the brain stem in a spiralingmotion. As the energy travels up through each vertebra, it passes the nervesthat run from the spinal cord to different parts of the body, and some of thatenergy is then transferred through the peripheral nerves that affect the tissuesand organs of the body. The current that runs along these nerve channelsactivates the body’s meridian system, resulting in all the other systems of thebody getting more energy.3 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt3]image [../Images/p321.jpg]As energy is released from the body to the brain, it passes by each spinal nerveexiting between each vertebra. The excitation of this system further switches onthe peripheral nerves, which then transfer more energy to different tissues andorgans in the body. As a result, more energy is delivered throughout the body.Once the energy reaches the brain stem, it must pass through the reticularformation. It’s the job of the reticular formation to constantly editinformation going from the brain to the body as well as from the body to thebrain. This formation is part of a system called the reticular activating system(RAS), which is responsible for levels of wakefulness. For instance, when youwake up from a deep sleep because you hear a sound in your house, it’s the RASthat alerts you and arouses you. That’s its rudimentary function. However, asthe sympathetic nervous system is activated and merges with the parasympatheticnervous system, instead of depleting the body’s stored energy, it releases thatenergy back to the brain. Once this energy reaches the brain stem, the thalamicgate opens like a door and energy moves through the reticular formation to thethalamus, where it relays information to the neocortex. Now the reticularformation is open and you experience greater levels of awareness. In a sense,you become more conscious and awakened. (Think of the thalamus as a big trainstation with tracks leading to the higher centers of the brain.) That’s how thebrain goes into gamma brain-wave patterns.image [../Images/p322.jpg]Right between each thalamus located in the midbrain sits the tinypinecone-shaped pineal gland, facing the back of the brain.As a side note, there are two individual thalami in the midbrain (one on eachside), which feed each hemisphere in the neocortex. The pineal gland sits rightbetween them facing the back of the brain (see Figure 12.8). When the energyreaches each thalamic junction (remember the thalamus is like a relay station toall other parts of the brain), these thalami send a message directly to thepineal gland to secrete its metabolites into the brain. The effect is that thethinking neocortex becomes aroused and goes into higher brain-wave patterns,like gamma. The nature of those chemical derivatives of melatonin relaxes thebody and at the same time awakens the mind.If you remember, when you’re in beta brain waves, your sympathetic nervoussystem is aroused for an emergency in your outer world and utilizes energy tosurvive. The difference with gamma brain waves is that instead of losing vitalenergy, you’re liberating and creating more energy in your body. You’re not inany emergency or survival state when this occurs; you’re in bliss, and yoursympathetic nervous system is switching on to arouse you to pay more attentionto whatever is happening within your mind.In Chapter 5 [../Text/chapter05.xhtml] I said that when energy moves from thebody to the brain, a torus field is created around the body. As you run acurrent up your spinal column by accelerating the movement of cerebrospinalfluid, your body becomes like a magnet and you create an electromagnetic fieldaround it. A torus field represents a dynamic flow of energy. At the same timethe torus field is moving up, out, and around your body, when the pineal glandbecomes activated, a reverse torus field of electromagnetic energy is drawingenergy into your body through the top of your head. Since all frequency carriesinformation, now your pineal gland is receiving information from beyond thevisible light field and from beyond your senses (see Figure 12.9).When these three happenings occur in tandem, it’s going to feel like you’rehaving an orgasm in your head. You’ve now created an antenna in your brain, andthis antenna is picking up information from realms beyond matter and beyondspace and time. Information is no longer coming from your senses or your eyes’interaction with your environment. Instead, you’re getting information from thequantum field moving to another eye—your third eye—from the pineal gland in theback of your brain.image [../Images/p324.jpg]As energy from the lower three centers is activated during the breath and movesup the spine to the brain, a torus field of electromagnetic energy is createdaround the body. When the pineal gland becomes activated, a reverse torus fieldof electromagnetic energy moving in the opposite direction draws energy throughthe top of the head into the body from the unified field. Since energy isfrequency and frequency carries information, the pineal gland transduces thatinformation into vivid imagery.When Melatonin Gets an Upgrade, Magic HappensWhen your pineal gland (or the third eye) is awakened, because it is picking uphigher frequencies, these higher energies alter the chemistry of melatonin; thehigher the frequency, the greater the alteration. It’s this translation ofinformation into chemistry that primes you for those transcendental, mysticalmoments. Now you’re opening the door to higher dimensions of space and time.This is why I like to call the pineal gland an alchemist—because it transmutesmelatonin into some very profound, radical neurotransmitters.image [../Images/p325.jpg]Check out the different metabolites of melatonin that are created when thepineal gland connects to frequencies faster than normal visible light and themystical molecule gets a biological upgrade.Take a look at Figure 12.10. As higher frequencies and higher states ofconsciousness interact with the pineal gland, one of the first things to happenis that these frequencies transmute melatonin into chemicals calledbenzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are a class of drugs, from which Valium iscreated, that anesthetize the analytical mind, so all of a sudden the thinkingbrain relaxes and stops analyzing. According to functional brain scans,benzodiazepines suppress neural activity in the amygdala, the brain’s survivalcenter. This limits chemicals that cause you to feel fear, anger, agitation,aggression, sadness, or pain.4 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt4] Now your bodyfeels calm and relaxed, but your mind is awakened.Another chemical created from melatonin produces a class of very powerfulantioxidants called pinolines (see Figure 12.10). Pinolines are importantbecause they attack free radicals, which harm your cells and cause aging. Theseantioxidants are anti-cancer, anti-aging, anti–heart disease, anti-stroke,anti-neurodegenerative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial. That’s a perfectformula to upgrade melatonin’s normal role as an antioxidant to the role of asupercharged antioxidant that further restores and heals the body to a greaterdegree than the melatonin molecule normally does. (See the powerful antioxidantslisted in Figure 12.10 that are all produced from metabolites of melatonin.)If you take that molecule and tweak it again into a cousin of melatonin, youfind the same chemical that makes animals hibernate. When melatonin (which makesus sleepy and dreamy) alters just slightly into this more powerful molecule, itcarries a message to extend rest and repair even further. This message alsocauses the body’s metabolism to slow, in some cases for months. It makes sense,then, that when mammals hibernate, they break the typical habits of theirhabitat; for example, they lose their sex drive, their appetite, their interestin or need to move about in their environment, and their connection to socialnetworks. They hide to protect themselves and to feel safe, and during this timeof going within, their body goes into stasis. The same might be true for us asthese values elevate. Because the body is no longer the mind, we temporarilylose our interest in the outer world; and because we have no biological drivesand aren’t distracted with bodily needs, we’re able to move more fully into thepresent moment and go deeply within. If you’re going to dream the dream of thefuture, wouldn’t it be a good idea to get your body out of the way?If you take that molecule and advance it yet again, you produce the samechemical found in electric eels—a phosphorescent, bioluminescent chemical thatamplifies energy in the nervous system. You can refer to Figure 12.10 again.This chemical can be powerful enough to cause a significant shock. I have astrong hunch this is the rare chemical that influences the brain to processthose increased amplitudes of energy that we’ve repeatedly measured in ourstudents. Just imagine an electric eel that literally lights up with energy whenit gets stimulated. That’s what happens in the brain when it gets activated. Butthe energy and information that are created do not come from an experience inour environment that we perceive through our senses, but instead from within thebrain, caused by an upgrade in frequency. When we see those high-energy levelsin the brain, we know that the person is having a profound, subjectiveexperience that can be measured objectively.Think about that for a moment. Via sensory input from our environment throughour eyes, the pineal gland makes serotonin and melatonin. This visible lightcoming from the sun causes us to move into harmony with our environment, whichwe call the circadian rhythm. As a result of this process, serotonin andmelatonin carry information equal to the frequency coming from the physicalworld. Because we perceive visible light through our senses, those molecules areinherent to humans; thus they are equivalent to the realm of ourthree-dimensional reality.Remember, as Einstein said, that the ceiling of this material world is the speedof light. But what happens as the brain processes an increase in frequency andinformation from a realm beyond the senses and beyond the speed of light? Is itpossible that information and energy coming from the unified field change thechemistry of melatonin to become another chemical counterpart in the brain? Andcould our brain translate those frequencies into a message? If energy is theepiphenomenon of matter, it makes sense that the information coming from afrequency faster than visible light would be able to alter the molecularstructure of melatonin into profound elixirs within our brain. The pineal glandis responsible for translating that information into a chemical variation ofmelatonin; therefore, that molecule carries a different message equal to thatfrequency. That new frequency is now influencing an enhanced superchemical.That’s no longer natural—that’s supernatural. Melatonin gets an upgrade.Not only does this phosphorescent, bioluminescent chemical increase the energyin the brain, but it enhances the imagery the mind internally perceives so thateverything looks as though it’s made of vivid, surreal, luminescent light. As aresult, people have reported experiencing colors they’ve never seen beforebecause they exist outside their known experience of the visible light spectrum.These colors appear as profound, otherworldly glowing lights in a Technicolor,lucid, opalescent world of suspended beauty. Everything appears as if it’semitting beautiful light made of vivid, radiant energy that you can feel. Thisworld of golden, shimmering, bright halos within and around everything appearsmore illuminated than your sensory-based reality. And of course, it will bedifficult to take your attention off all its beauty. Because all of yourattention is on this experience, it will seem as though you are actually there,totally present, in this other world or dimension.Take a look at Figure 12.10 again. Alter melatonin one more time and you producethe chemical dimethyltryptamine (DMT), one of the most powerful hallucinogenicsubstances known to man. This is the same chemical found in ayahuasca, atraditional spiritual plant medicine used in ceremonies by the indigenous peopleof the Amazon. DMT’s primary active ingredient is said to create spiritualvisions and profound insights into the mystery of the self. When ayahuasca orother plant chemicals containing this molecule are ingested, the body receivesonly DMT, but when the pineal gland is activated, it receives the whole blend ofaforementioned chemicals—and this causes some very profound inner experiences.Some of these experiences have been reported to create profound time dilation(time appears infinite), time travel, journeys to paranormal realms, visions ofcomplex geometric patterns, encounters with spiritual beings, and other mysticalinterdimensional realities. Many of our students during the pineal glandmeditation report amazing encounters beyond their known physical world.When these chemicals are released in the brain, the mind has experiences thatappear more real than anything that person has ever encountered in theirsensory-based reality. This new dimension is difficult to articulate withlanguage. The novel experience that results will occur as a complete unknown,and if you surrender to it, it’s always worth it.Tuning In to Higher Dimensions: The Pineal Gland as a TransducerDepending on the translation you’re using, in Matthew 6:22 Jesus said, “If thineeye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.” I believe he was talkingabout activating the pineal gland, because this allows us to experience abroader spectrum of reality. Many of our students can attest to the fact thatwhen their pineal gland becomes activated—when they fully connect with theunified field—their whole body becomes filled with energy and light. Beginningfrom the cosmic field, energy from beyond their senses enters through the top oftheir head and travels down throughout their whole body. When this occurs, theyexperience downloadable information beyond their memory base or the predictableknowns of their daily lives—and it all begins with the chemical alteration ofmelatonin in the pineal gland.In all of my research about the pineal gland, I’ve evolved my own understandingof it into the following definition: The pineal gland is a crystallinesuperconductor that sends, as well as receives, information through thetransduction of energetic vibrational signals (frequency beyond the senses, alsoknown as the quantum field) and translates it into biological tissue (the brainand the mind) in the form of meaningful imagery, the same way as an antennatranslates different channels onto a TV screen.When the pineal gland is activated, because you now have this tiny antenna inyour brain, the higher the frequency it picks up, the more energy it exertstoward altering and transmuting the chemistry of melatonin. As a result of thischange in chemistry, you’re going to get a very different experience from whatmelatonin normally produces. Perhaps a better way to say it is that you’re goingto get a clearer picture. Think of it this way: The higher the frequency, themore your experience will feel like you’ve gone from the picture of a 1960stelevision screen to a 360-degree IMAX 3-D experience, complete with surroundsound. Melatonin, the dreaming neurotransmitter, evolves into a more powerfullylucid neurotransmitter to make our dreams more real.Throughout this process, the pineal gland has a co-conspirator called thepituitary gland. The pituitary gland looks like a pear and sits behind thebridge of the upper nose, right in the middle of the brain. The front (anterior)part of it is responsible for making most of the chemicals that influence theglands and hormones associated with each of our energy centers. Once the pinealgland is activated and it releases certain upgraded metabolites5[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt5] the back (posterior) of the pituitary glandawakens, causing it to produce two important chemicals—oxytocin andvasopressin.6 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt6]The first chemical, oxytocin, is known to produce elevated emotions that causeyour heart to swell with love and joy (it’s been referred to as the chemical ofemotional connection or the bonding hormone). When oxytocin levels are elevatedabove normal, most people experience intense feelings of love, forgiveness,compassion, joy, wholeness, and empathy—not an inner state you’d probably bewilling to trade for something outside of you. (These states are, after all, thebeginning of unconditional love.)When oxytocin levels go up beyond a certain level, research shows that it’sdifficult to hold a grudge. In a study conducted by scientists at the Universityof Zurich, 49 participants played a variation of what is known as the Trust Game12 consecutive times. In this game, an investor with a certain amount of moneymust decide either to keep it or to share some of it with another player calledthe trustee. Whatever sum the investor shares with the trustee is automaticallytripled. The trustee is then faced with a decision: keep all the money, leavingthe investor with nothing, or share the tripled sum with the investor, who isobviously hoping to make a profit. Basically, the either/or decision comes downto betrayal. While a selfish act is a win for the trustee, it leaves theinvestor at a loss.But what if oxytocin is introduced into the equation? In the study, theresearchers gave some players a squirt of oxytocin in their nose before thegame, giving the others a squirt of placebo. The researchers then took fMRI(functional magnetic resonance imaging) scans of the investors’ brains as theymade their decisions regarding the amount to invest and whether or not to trust.After the first six rounds, the investors were given feedback on theirinvestments and were notified that their trust had been betrayed about half ofthe time. The participants who received the placebo before playing the game feltangry and betrayed, so they invested much less in the closing six rounds. Theparticipants who received a squirt of oxytocin, however, invested the sameamount as they had in the first rounds, despite having been betrayed. The fMRIscans showed the key areas of the brain affected were the amygdala (associatedwith fear, anxiety, stress, and aggression) and the dorsal striatum (whichguides future behaviors based on positive feedback). Participants who receivedthe oxytocin had much lower activity in the amygdala, equating to less anger andfear of being betrayed again, as well as less fear of financial loss. They alsohad much lower activity in the dorsal striatum, meaning they no longer needed torely on positive results to make future decisions.7[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt7]As this study demonstrates, the moment the posterior pituitary releases itschemicals and oxytocin levels go up, this shuts down the survival centers in thebrain’s amygdala, meaning it cools off the circuits for fear, sadness, pain,anxiety, aggression, and anger. Then the only thing we feel is a love for life.We’ve measured the levels of oxytocin in our students before and after ourworkshops. At the conclusion of the event, some of them had elevated theirlevels significantly. When we interviewed those students, many of them keptsaying, “I’m just so in love with my life and everyone in it. I never want thisfeeling to go away. I want to remember this feeling forever. This is who Ireally am.”The other chemical the pituitary gland makes as the pineal gland is activated iscalled vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone. As vasopressin levels go up, thebody naturally retains fluids, causing the body to become more water-based. Thisis important because if you’re going to process a greater frequency, you needwater to act as a conduit to better handle the higher frequency in the body, andto then translate that frequency into your cells. The moment vasopressin goesup, it creates a more stable thyroid gland—which affects the thymus and theheart, which affects the adrenals, which affects the pancreas, which produces achain cascade of positive effects all the way down to the sexual organs.8[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt8]When we tune in to these higher frequencies, we have access to a different kindof light—a frequency faster than visible light—and all of a sudden we areactivating a greater intelligence within us. Now, because the pineal gland isactivated, we can pick up higher frequencies, which in turn produces a change inchemistry. The higher the frequency we pick up, the more it alters ourchemistry—which means the more visual, hallucinogenic, and higher-energyexperiences we have. The crystals in our pineal gland, acting like a cosmicantenna, are the doorway to these higher vibrational realms of light andinformation. This is how we have internal experiences that are more real thanour external ones.These pineal metabolite chemicals your body produces fit into the same receptorsites as serotonin and melatonin, but they carry a very different chemicalmessage from a realm beyond sensory-based material reality. As a result, thebrain is now primed for a mystical experience, opening the door to otherdimensions and moving the individual from a space-time reality to a time-spacereality. Since all frequency carries a message and that message is a change inchemistry, once the pineal gland gets activated and you start experiencing andprocessing these higher frequencies, energies, and elevated levels ofconsciousness, they often present themselves as complex, changing geometricpatterns usually perceived in the mind’s eye. This is good—this is information.When you have these mystical experiences, because your nervous system is socoherent, it’s able to tune in to these super coherent messages. In the darknessof the void, the pineal gland becomes the vortex for these very organizedpatterns and packets of information, and as you place your attention on them,just like a kaleidoscope they constantly change and evolve. The same way a TVpicks up frequencies and turns them into pictures on the screen, the pinealgland chemically transduces higher frequencies into vivid, surreal images.In Graphic 13 in the color insert, you can see some of these geometric patterns,which are called divine (or sacred) geometry. Such patterns have been around forthousands of years. In Chapter 8 [../Text/chapter08.xhtml], I mentioned thatthese patterns appear to look like ancient mandalas. They’re energy andinformation in the form of frequency, and if you can surrender to them, yourbrain (via the pineal gland) will transduce those forms, messages, andinformation into very vivid pictures, imagery, or lucid experiences. The bestthing to do when you see or experience these patterns is to surrender to themand not try to make anything happen.These patterns and forms usually do not appear as two-dimensional or static;instead, they are alive, have depth, and comprise mathematical and very coherentfractal patterns, never ending and infinitely complex. Another way to see thisis through the concept of cymatics. Derived from the Greek word for “wave,”cymatics are a phenomenon based on vibration or frequency. Here’s a way topicture them: Imagine if you took the cover off of an old speaker box and laidit flat. If you filled that speaker with fluid, shined a light on it, and beganplaying classical music up through it, the frequency and vibration of the musicwould eventually create coherent standing waves. These waves would interferewith each other and eventually create geometric patterns within patterns withinpatterns. As with a kaleidoscope, you would see these evolving geometricarrangements becoming more highly organized. The difference between the imagesin the kaleidoscope and cymatics is that the images in the kaleidoscope appeartwo-dimensional. Geometric patterns such as cymatics, however, appear to bealive and are three-dimensional or even multidimensional. In addition to water,the vibrational effects of cymatics are translatable to sand and air; in otherwords, these three mediums pick up vibration and frequency and turn them intocoherent geometric patterns. (If you search, you can find several videos showingthis on YouTube.)When your pineal gland picks up information, it’s picking up these same types ofwaves in the environment around you. These coherent, highly organized standingwaves that exist beyond the visible light spectrum are constantly beingconsolidated into packets of information and transduced into images by yourpineal gland. They are just patterns of information that are intersecting in avery coherent way, and when you put your awareness on them, they change andevolve to become increasingly more fractal, intricate, beautiful, and divine.It’s all information, and just like a transducer, your pineal gland takes thatinformation and descrambles it into imagery. This is one of the reasons Idecided to use the kaleidoscope as a tool in our advanced events, to trainstudents’ brains to be disarmed when they experience this mode of compleximagery, as well as to more easily recognize—and open up to—receiving this typeof information. Additionally, as the kaleidoscope causes the brain to move intoalpha or theta brain waves and you become more suggestible, you can see howgazing into it in a state of trance primes your subconscious mind for a mysticalexperience.Once your pineal gland picks up the imagery, fasten your seatbelt because thingsare going to get exciting. You might come out of your body and travel down atunnel of light, or your entire body might become filled with light. You mighteven feel like you’ve become the entire universe, and when looking down at yourbody, even find yourself wondering how you’re going to get back into it.When you start having these very profound, unknown experiences, you have one oftwo choices: You can contract in fear because it’s the unknown, or you cansurrender and trust—because it’s the unknown. The more you surrender and trust,the deeper and more profound your experiences become, and because the experienceis so profound, you’re not going to want to rouse yourself back to wakefulness,thereby changing your brain waves back to beta. Instead, this is the time tosurrender, relax, and go even deeper into this transcendental state ofconsciousness. In this moment, you are not sleeping, you are not awake, you arenot dreaming—you are transcendent of this reality. If your brain chemistry isright, your body will be totally and completely sedated. This is what we aretraining for: to experience greater levels of wholeness, oneness, love, andhigher consciousness.But there’s more . . .Alteration in Chemistry Creates a New RealityImagine if in this moment all your senses were increased by 25 percent. If thatwere the case, everything you were seeing, hearing, tasting, smelling, andfeeling would cause you to become more aware of everything around you. Ifawareness and consciousness are the same, then as your consciousness isheightened, the energy your brain is receiving would also be increased (becauseyou can’t have a change in consciousness without a change in energy, or viceversa). As your brain connects to a different frequency that is processing a newstream of consciousness, it is literally turning on, and because your sensesfeel amplified, you’ve produced an elevated level of awareness. The higher theenergy or frequency, the greater the alteration in your chemistry, and thegreater the alteration in your chemistry, the more lucid your experience willbe. So when you’re in this transcendental state, you feel more awake and moreaware than you are in your day-to-day reality. As your awareness amplifies, youwould feel as if you were truly in that transcendental reality.If you’re picking up information from beyond your senses, information that isnot originating from visible light or the sun, then it makes sense that it’scalled the “third eye.” Because you had such a profound internal experience, andsince new experiences assemble new neural networks, that experience enriches thecircuitry in your brain. As your body processes these higher energies, thatenergy alters your chemistry, and if the end result of an experience is anemotion, then this experience creates elevated feelings and emotions. When it’sactivated, you are seeing with a different eye, with inner vision.If the accumulation of feelings equals an emotion, and emotion is energy, thenwe know that when you experience survival emotions, because they are a loweringof frequency, you feel more like the density of matter and chemistry. But as youexperience these higher states of consciousness, because they vibrate at ahigher frequency you will begin to feel less like matter or chemistry and morelike energy. That’s why I call this energy in the form of feelings elevatedemotions.If the environment signals the genes in a cell, and experiences from theenvironment create emotions—and emotions are the chemical feedback from theexperience in the environment—then if nothing ever changes in the externalenvironment, nothing changes in the internal environment of the body (which isstill the outer environment of the cell). For example, when you live by the sameself-limiting emotions for years, your body never biologically changes becauseit doesn’t know the difference between the emotion coming from the outerenvironment and the emotion coming from your inner environment. Instead, thebody believes it is living in the same environmental conditions because the sameemotions are producing the same chemical signals. Just as the body lives in anexternal environment in which nothing is changing, the cell too lives in achemical environment in which nothing is changing.But when you start having these internal experiences of heightened awareness andexpanded consciousness—experiences that are more real and sensory than any inthe past—the moment you feel that new heightened emotion or ecstatic energy,you’ve altered your internal state, and as a result you’re going to pay moreattention to the images of the reality created within you. And if you have a newexperience that is so real it captures all the brain’s attention, that newexperience (or awakening) embosses the event neurologically in your brain. Thatnew emotion now creates a long-term memory and those new emotions signal newgenes, but this time the experience that’s creating the long-term memory is notcoming from your outer environment; it’s coming from your innerenvironment—which is still the outer environment of the cell.Because the event is so powerful that you cannot not be aware, therefore: * The higher the energy, the higher the consciousness; * The higher the consciousness, the greater the awareness; * The greater the awareness, the broader experience of reality you have.As we know, all perception is based on how the brain is wired from ourexperiences in the past. We don’t perceive things in our reality the way theyare; we perceive reality the way we are. If you just had an internal experiencein which you saw profound mystical beings; witnessed a glow, a halo, or lightaround everything; felt the wholeness, oneness, and interconnectedness ofeverything and everyone; or experienced a completely different time and space,when you open your eyes after the experience, your spectrum of reality in yourwaking state will be broadened. That’s because the inner experience changed yourbrain and now you’re neurologically wired to perceive a greater expression ofreality. This is how you begin to change who you are from the inside out. Thisis how you alter your experience of the three-dimensional world of matter.Evolution, on both an individual and a species level, is a slow process. Youhave experiences, you get hurt, you learn your lesson, you grow a little bit.Then you have some more pain, you get the next lesson, you move on to the nextchallenge, you succeed and achieve goals, you set more goals, you grow again,and the cycle continues. It’s a slow process because you’re not receiving muchnew information from your outer environment.But once you have these unknown internal experiences that are more real thananything in your external world, you can never again see reality in the samemanner because the experience changes you so profoundly. Another way to say itis that you receive an upgrade or a software update. If all of the reality youperceive is based on your experiences, and you’ve just had an interdimensionalexperience, your brain is now going to be able to perceive what has alwaysexisted but you have never before had the brain circuitry to perceive.If you continuously have these expansive experiences, you’ll continuouslyexperience a broader and broader spectrum of reality. This lifts the veil ofillusion, and when that veil is lifted you can see reality as it trulyis—vibrating, shining, connected, and shimmering in luminescent light—and energyis driving the whole process. You’re now tuning in to a greater spectrum ofinformation where all of a sudden everything looks and feels different than itdid when you saw it simply as matter—and your relationship changes. This is howthe mystics and masters made their way: by tuning in to their inner world andthus broadening their perception of the nature of reality in their outer world.Imagine who you could become if you stopped living by the hallmarks of the lowerthree energy centers, including survival, fear, pain, separation, anger, andcompetition, and instead lived from the heart and operated out of love, oneness,and connection to all things, both seen and unseen.By having enough interdimensional experiences from information beyond thesenses, the mystics and masters no longer saw equal to the genes they were bornwith. They no longer processed things the way the brain they’d been given atbirth had been wired—the way the human brain has been imprinted for thousands ofyears. Instead, because of their interaction with the field, they created theawareness, the circuitry, and the mind to perceive a different reality—onethat’s always been there.These mythic and magical properties of the pineal gland, the brain’s alchemist,are certainly not new information, although it seems modern science is just nowcatching up to what ancient civilizations have always known.image [../Images/p336.jpg]This crop circle found in Roundway, UK, on July 23, 2011, shows the chemicalstructure of melatonin . . . maybe someone is trying to tell us something.Melatonin, Mathematics, Ancient Symbols, and the Pineal GlandOn July 23, 2011, a crop circle that looks very much like the chemical structureof melatonin appeared in the English countryside in Roundway near Devizes,Wiltshire. (See Figure 12.11.) Is the crop circle an elaborate hoax? Or issomebody somewhere in another dimension trying to tell us something? As you readthis section, you can decide for yourself whether such things happen bycoincidence or intelligent design.The brain has two hemispheres, and if you divided them in half by slicing thebrain down the middle, you would perform what is known as a sagittal cut. Whenlooking at the sagittal cut in Figure 12.12, pay particular attention to thelocation and collective formation of the pineal gland, thalamus, hypothalamus,pituitary gland, and corpus callosum. Does that formation remind you ofanything? Meant to signify protection, power, and good health, it’s the ancientEgyptian symbol called the Eye of Horus. Is it possible that there was anancient teaching about the autonomic nervous system, the reticular activatingsystem, the thalamic gate, and the pineal gland? The Egyptians must have knownthe significance of the autonomic nervous system and realized that activatingthe pineal gland meant they could enter the otherworld, or other dimensions.9[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch12_nt9]image [../Images/p337.jpg]If you slice the brain down the middle, you can view the limbic brain. Take alook and you’ll notice a striking resemblance to the Eye of Horus.In the Egyptian system of measurement, the Eye of Horus also represented afractional quantification system to measure parts of the whole. In modernmathematics, we call this the Fibonacci constant, or Fibonacci’s sequence. As Imentioned earlier in the book, this is a mathematical formula that shows upeverywhere in nature, displayed in patterns you can see in sunflowers,seashells, pineapples, pinecones, eggs, and even the structure of our Milky Waygalaxy. Also known as the golden spiral, the golden mean, or the golden ratio,the Fibonacci constant is characterized by the fact that every number after thefirst two is the sum of the preceding two.If you superimposed this formula over the brain and began dividing squares whileadding another square and another square, you’d get a fractal pattern, anever-ending pattern that repeats itself at every scale. Starting at the pinealgland, this formula outlines the exact structure of the brain (see Figure12.13). Are you beginning to think there might be something special going onwith the pineal gland?image [../Images/p338.jpg]If you follow the golden ratio, Fibonacci’s constant, along the circumference ofthe brain, the spiral will end at the exact point of the pineal gland.In Greek mythology, Hermes was a messenger of the gods who could move in and outof earthly and divine realms. He was considered a god of transitions anddimensions, as well as a guide to the afterlife. His main symbol was thecaduceus, which consists of two snakes wrapped around a rod, the top of whichunfolds into wings or birds. (See Figure 12.14.) The caduceus, which Hermes usedas a staff, is often considered a symbol of health. Do you think those snakesmoving up the staff represent the movement of energy up the spine from the bodyto the brain, and the wings the liberation of the self when the energy arrivesat the pineal gland to signify enlightenment? The crown represents our highestpotential and our greatest expression of the divine when we activate our pinealgland (represented by the pinecone). The crowning of the Self is the conqueringof the self. This is why I chose this image for the cover of this book.image [../Images/p339.jpg]Tuning In to Higher Dimensions of Time and Space MeditationSince melatonin levels are at their height between 1 A.M. and 4 A.M., that’s thebest time to do this meditation. Start by activating your heart center for onesong. Then bless your energy centers, starting with the lowest one, as youlearned in the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation in Chapter 4[../Text/chapter04.xhtml]. Bless this energy center by resting your attentionfirst in the space of that energy center, and then in the space around it. Dothis for the first and then for the second energy center, and then focus yourattention on the first and second center at the same time. Continue this processwith each energy center, creating a bigger field by connecting each new energycenter to the prior centers. Eventually you’ll align all eight centers and theenergy around your entire body simultaneously. This should take about 45minutes. Then lie down for 20 minutes and let your autonomic nervous system takethe orders to balance the body.Now sit up and do the breath, bringing that energy all the way up to the top ofyour head. Hold it and squeeze, compressing the crystals of the pineal gland,thus activating it and creating an electromagnetic field. That field is going tostretch as far as it can go and then it’s going to reverse and compress thosecrystals. As you increase the frequency, you’re going to pick up higher andhigher vibrational realms, and then your brain is going to take that informationand turn it into imagery. One last point about this breath: I want to emphasizethat it is not necessary to take a fast, deep breath and then squeeze yourintrinsic muscles and then hold your breath to the point that you turn purple.Instead, I want you to take a very slow, long, steady breath, coordinating thebreath with the contraction of your intrinsic muscles equally as you inhale andslowly follow that breath all the way to the top of your head.This is the fourth way you can activate the pineal gland. When you’re done withthe breath, rest your attention between the back of your throat and the back ofyour head in space—you are locating that gland, and by placing your attentionthere, you are placing your energy there. Keep your attention there for about 5to 10 minutes. As a thought, an awareness, and consciousness, get really tinyand move into the chamber of the pineal gland and sense the space of that room,in the center of this organ, in space. Linger there for about 5 to 10 minutes.Then sense the frequency and space beyond the boundaries of the gland. Radiatethe energy beyond that room into the big black space. Direct that energy tocarry the intention that this gland release its sacred metabolites for themystical experience. Broadcast that information into the space beyond your head,in space.Now open up, tune in to the energy beyond your head in that vast, eternal blackspace, and just receive. The longer you’re conscious of this energy, and themore you can receive that frequency, the more you are altering and upgradingmelatonin to its radical metabolites. Don’t expect anything to happen, don’t tryto anticipate—just keep receiving. Finally, lie down again, and let theautonomic nervous system take over. Enjoy the scenery!"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 13 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t13]image [../Images/line.jpg]PROJECT COHERENCE: MAKING A BETTER WORLD [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t13]image [../Images/line.jpg]We are living in a time of extremes, and these extremes are both a reflection ofan old consciousness that can no longer survive and a future consciousness inwhich planet Earth herself, and all of us on Earth, are transforming. This oldconsciousness is driven by survival emotions like hatred, violence, prejudice,anger, fear, suffering, competition, and pain—emotions that serve to seduce usinto believing we are separate from one another. The illusion of separationtaxes and divides individuals, communities, societies, countries, and MotherNature herself. The mindlessness, carelessness, greed, and disrespect of humanactivity is threatening life as we know it. By pure logic and reason, this typeof consciousness cannot sustain itself for much longer.Because everything is moving toward extreme polarities, undeniably many of thecurrent systems—whether political, economic, religious, cultural, educational,medical, or environmental—are being pulled apart as antiquated paradigmscollapse. We can see this most prominently in journalism, where no one knowswhat to believe anymore. Some of these changes reflect people’s choices, whileothers reflect increasing levels of personal awareness. One thing is apparent,however; in this age of information, everything that is not in alignment withthe evolution of this new consciousness is coming to the surface.If you aren’t aware that there is an increase in frequency and energy occurringat this time—an increase in anxiety, tension, and passion—then you might not bepaying attention to your own state of being and mankind’s interconnectedness tothis energy. In addition to the upheavals in our highly charged political,social, economic, and personal environments, many people also feel as if time isspeeding up—or that more momentous happenings are occurring in a shorter amountof time. Depending on your outlook, this could be either an exciting time ofawakening or an anxiety-inducing moment in history. Regardless, the old mustfall away or break down so that something more functional can emerge in itsplace. This is how people, species, consciousness, and even the planet itselfevolve.This excitement in energy both within humans and nature begs several questions:Could greater influences be at play that are affecting mankind’s correlation toviolence, war, crime, and terrorism—and conversely, peace, unity, coherence, andlove? And is there a reason why all of this is happening at this particulartime?The History of Peace-Gathering ProjectsTo date, the power of temporary peace-gathering projects has been exhibited andthoroughly field tested in more than 50 demonstration projects and 23peer-reviewed scientific studies scrutinized by independent scholars around theworld.1 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt1] The results have consistentlydemonstrated a positive effect in the immediate reduction of crime, warfare, andterrorism by an average of greater than 70 percent.2[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt2] Think about that for a moment. When a group ofpeople come together with the specific intention or collective consciousness tochange some “thing” or to produce an outcome, if they create it with the energyand emotions of peace, unity, or oneness—without physically doing anything—thatunified community can produce changes 70 percent of the time. To quantify theresults of these studies, scientists use a measurement called lead-lag analysis.The purpose of lead-lag analysis is to uncover correlations between people andincidents. For example, if you looked at the lead-lag analysis of achain-smoker, it would show that the more a person smokes, the greater chancethey will have of developing lung cancer. In relation to peace-gatheringprojects, the studies have found that the greater the number of meditators orpeace gatherers (combined with the amount of time they meditate), the greaterinfluence the gathering has upon decreasing incidences of crime and violence insociety.A powerful example is the Lebanon peace project, which brought together a groupof meditators in Jerusalem in August and September of 1983 to demonstrate the“radiating influence of peace.” Although the number of meditators fluctuatedover time, it was often large enough to achieve the super radiance effect forboth Israel and nearby Lebanon. This effect happens when a group of speciallytrained meditators come together at the same time on a daily basis to create andradiate a positive effect on society. The results of the two-month study showedthat on days when there was a high participation of meditators, a 76 percentreduction of war deaths occurred. Other effects included reduced crime andfires, decreased traffic accidents, less terrorism, and increases in economicgrowth. The results were then replicated in seven consecutive experiments over atwo-year period during the peak of the Lebanon war.3[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt3] All of this was achieved simply by combiningpeople’s intention for peace and coherence with the elevated emotions of loveand compassion. This clearly demonstrates that the more unified theconsciousness of a group of people within a specific elevated energy is, themore it can change the consciousness and the energy of others in a nonlocal way.In what’s considered one of the top three peace-gathering studies in the Westernhemisphere, a RAND Corporation think tank assembled a group of nearly 8,000 (andsometimes more) trained meditators to focus on world peace and coherence duringthree periods ranging from 8 to 11 days each, from 1983 to 1985. The resultsshowed that during this time, worldwide terrorism was reduced by 72 percent.4[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt4] Can you imagine the results and positiveeffects, as well as the speed with which they would occur, if this type ofmeditation and mindfulness was a part of the education curriculum?In still another study, this time in India from 1987 to 1990, 7,000 peoplegathered to focus on world peace. During that three-year period, the worldwitnessed remarkable transformations toward world peace: The Cold War ended, theBerlin Wall came down, the Iran-Iraq war came to an end, South Africa began tomove toward abolishing apartheid, and terrorist attacks subsided. What surprisedeveryone was the swiftness with which these global changes occurred, all in arelatively peaceful manner.5 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt5]In 1993, from June 7 to July 30, approximately 2,500 meditators gathered inWashington, D.C., in a highly controlled experiment to focus on peace andcoherent energy. For the first five months of the year, violent crime had beensteadily on the rise, yet soon after the study began, a significant statisticalreduction in violence (as measured by FBI Uniform Crime Reports), crime, andstress in Washington, D.C., began to occur.6 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt6]These results point to the fact that a relatively small group of people unitedin love and purpose can have a statistically significant effect on a diversepopulation.On September 11, 2001, due to the immediacy of global media, human beings allover the planet felt horror, shock, fear, terror, and grief as planes crashedinto New York City’s World Trade Center, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and afield near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. In an instant, the world’s collectiveconsciousness tuned in to this event. Powerful emotional outpourings around theglobe occurred as people bonded, formed communities, and took care of oneanother.During the unfolding of events on 9/11, scientists at Princeton University’sGlobal Consciousness Project were collecting data via the Internet from morethan 40 devices around the world. As data poured in to a central server inPrinceton, New Jersey, the scientists witnessed dramatic changes in the patternsin their random event generator. (Think of a random event generator as acomputerized coin toss. It’s measuring heads or tails, or ones and zeros, soaccording to statistics it should produce nearly 50/50 results.) The dramaticchanges in patterns right after the event caused the scientists to determinethat the collective emotional response of people’s outpouring was enough that itcould actually be measured in the Earth’s magnetic field.7[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt7]What all of these studies ultimately point to is that there’s significantevidence that group meditations of the right size with skilled meditators whochange their emotions and energy can influence and create nonlocal, measurableeffects on peace and global coherence. If these peace-gathering projects are aforce for coherence throughout a society, are there antithetical forces thatcould be working against humans to produce incoherence?The Earth’s Relationship to Solar CyclesAs the Earth rotates daily on its axis, every morning the sun brings light tothe darkness, warmth and comfort to the chill of night, photosynthesis toplants, and security to humans. It’s for this reason that as far back as 14,000B.C.E., adoration of the sun has been sketched onto stone tablets and cavewalls. Countless mythologies (including civilizations in ancient Egypt andMesopotamia, the Mayans and the Aztecs, and the Australian Aborigines, to namejust a few) have extolled the sun as worthy of worship, as well as a source ofenlightenment, illumination, and wisdom. No matter the location, most cultureshave recognized the sun as the prime controller of all life on Earth becausewithout it, life here could not exist.For the most part humans are electromagnetic beings (entities that constantlysend and receive messages via vibrational energies) whose bodies are made up ofgravitationally organized light and information. (In fact, everything materialin this three-dimensional world is gravitationally organized light andinformation.) Just as we are individual electromagnetic beings, we are but asmall link in the chain of an electromagnetic world, the individual parts ofwhich cannot be separated from the whole.On a grand scale, it is impossible to deny the interconnectivity between thesun’s energy, the Earth’s energy, and the energy of all living species. On amicro level, all you have to do is look at the life cycle of a fruit orvegetable to understand this interdependence. The vegetable or fruit begins as aseed, and when environmental conditions such as water, temperature,nutrient-rich soil, and photosynthesis conspire, these conditions enable theseed to germinate. Eventually the blossom of the seed becomes an integral partof an ecosystem, as well as a source of sustenance and nourishment for variousforms of life. This complex chain and delicate balance of events all begins withthe Earth’s uniquely situated location in our solar system. Known as thecircumstellar habitable zone, this is a range of orbital distance around a star(our sun) in which a planet can support liquid water.While the sun may be almost 93 million miles away, when it becomes active it hassignificant consequences to life on Earth because the Earth and the sun arerelated by electromagnetic fields. The purpose of the Earth’s electromagneticfield (see Figure 13.1) is to protect it from the harmful effects of solarradiation and sunspots, cosmic rays, and other forms of space weather. Althoughnot totally understood, sunspots are relatively dark, cool areas of the suncaused by interactions within the sun’s magnetic field; they can be up to 32,000miles in diameter. You can think of sunspots as a cap on a seltzer bottle; ifyou shake the bottle and then remove the cap, it’s going to produce a largerelease of photons (light) and other forms of high-frequency radiation.8[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt8]image [../Images/p346.jpg]The Earth’s electromagnetic field.If it were not for the protection and insulation of Earth’s electromagneticfields, life as we know it could not exist, for we would be constantly bombardedby a steady stream of deadly particles. For example, when there are solarflares, the Earth’s electromagnetic field protects the planet by deflectingtrillions of tons of photonic emissions called mass coronal ejections. Masscoronal ejections are huge explosions of plasma and magnetic fields from thesun’s corona that can extend millions of miles into space. Their effects tend toreach the Earth an average of 24 to 36 hours after they occur.These ejections compress the Earth’s field, heating the Earth’s iron core. Asthis core becomes altered, it changes the planet’s electromagnetic field. Theseejections are a part of solar cycles that occur approximately every 11 years—andthey have the potential to disturb all living organisms on the Earth.The recording of solar cycles began in 1755, but in 1915 an 18-year-old Russianboy named Alexander Chizhevsky took mankind’s understanding of the sun and itsrelation to the Earth to the next level when he spent his summer observing oursun. During that summer he began hypothesizing that periods of solar activitymight have effects on the organic world. A year later he entered World War I,and when not fighting for Russia, he again cast his observations toward the sun.He noticed in particular that battles tended to wax or wane depending on thestrength of solar flares (see Graphic 14 in the color insert).9[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt9] Chizhevsky later compiled the histories of 72countries from 1749 to 1926, comparing the annual number of important politicaland social events (such as the start of wars, revolutions, outbreaks ofdiseases, and violence) with increased solar activity, demonstrating acorrelation between the sun’s activity and human excitability. Equallyinteresting, solar activity has also been associated with great humanflourishing, including innovations in architecture, science, the arts, andsocial change.10 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt10]Every place where you see the red line spiking in the graphic represents anactive solar flare or sunspot that occurred between the years 1750 and 1922. Theblue lines represent historically important events that took place within thesame period. Chizhevsky eventually determined that 80 percent of thesecountries’ most significant events occurred during solar events and geomagneticactivity.11 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt11] The solar release of energy—whichis always carrying information—seems to be in almost perfect coherence with theactivities, the energy, and the consciousness of our planet. It just so happensthat at the time of this writing, in 2017, we are in the midst of a very activesolar cycle.In the past decade, much has been said about how this solar energy is affectingthe planet and all of life that inhabits it. In 2012, doomsayers thought the endof the Mayan calendar, which correlates to the December solstice, meant the endof the world was at hand. Today astrologers talk about the Age of Aquarius (anastrological age is a period consisting of approximately 2,150 years thatcorresponds to the average time it takes for the vernal equinox to move from oneconstellation of the zodiac into the next) and how it will usher in a newawareness for humanity. Astronomers and cosmologists talk about galacticalignment, a rare astronomical event occurring every 12,960 years that bringsthe sun into alignment with the center of the Milky Way galaxy.Regardless of what you believe, all of these occurrences point to solar cyclesthat increase the energy coming toward the Earth from the sun. Since we areelectromagnetic beings, connected to the Earth through electromagnetic fieldsand shielded from the sun by electromagnetic fields, this increase in energyfrom the sun is going to change both the energy of the Earth and our personalenergy. This means that this new energy has the potential to influence humanbeings in either positive or negative ways, depending on our individual energy.For example, if you are feeling separation, living by survival emotions andenslaved to the hormones and chemicals of stress, your brain and heart are goingto fire incoherently. This will cause your energy and awareness to becomedivided and out of balance, and the increase in energy from the sun is going toenhance that state of being. Therefore, if you are living in incoherence, thatincoherence is going to become amplified.By the same means, if you are living in the coherent alignment of head andheart, working daily in your meditations to connect to the unified field and toovercome your limited beliefs and attitudes, you are going to be propelled evenfurther into the truth and understanding of who you are and what your purposeis.The bottom line is that we are in the midst of an initiation, and it is going totake a tremendous amount of will, awareness, and consciousness to stay focusedso as not to succumb to these excitable energies. If we can maintain our focus,then instead of being victims of the uncertainty, we can transmute this energyinto greater degrees of orderliness, coherence, and even peace, both personallyand globally. In the simplest terms, this energy is going to endorse who you arebeing—that is, how you are thinking and feeling.The Schumann ResonanceIn 1952, German physicist and professor W. O. Schumann hypothesized there weremeasurable electromagnetic waves in the atmosphere in the cavity (or space)between the Earth’s surface and the ionosphere. According to NASA, theionosphere is an abundant layer of electrons, ionized atoms, and molecules thatstretches from approximately 30 miles above the surface of the Earth to the edgeof space, about 600 miles up. This dynamic region grows and shrinks (and furtherdivides into sub-regions) based on solar conditions, and it’s a critical link inthe chain of sun-Earth interactions.12 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt12] It’sthis “celestial power station” that makes radio communications possible.In 1954, Schumann and H. L. König confirmed Schumann’s hypothesis by detectingresonances at a main frequency of 7.83 Hz; thus the “Schumann resonance” wasestablished by measuring global electromagnetic resonances generated and excitedby lightning discharges in the ionosphere. You can think of this frequency as atuning fork for life. In other words, it acts as a background frequencyinfluencing the biological circuitry of the mammalian brain (the subconsciousbrain below the neocortex, which is also the home of the autonomic nervoussystem). The Schumann frequency affects our bodies’ balance, health, and verynature as mammals. In fact, the absence of the Schumann resonance can causeserious mental and physical health issues in the human body.This was demonstrated through research by German scientist Rutger Wever from theMax Planck Institute for Behavioral Physiology in Erling-Andechs, Germany. Inthe study, he took young, healthy student volunteers for four weeks at a timeand placed them in hermetically sealed underground bunkers that screened out theSchumann frequency. Throughout the four weeks, the students’ circadian rhythmschanged, causing them to suffer emotional distress and migraine headaches. WhenWever introduced the Schumann frequency back into the bunkers, after only abrief exposure to 7.83 Hz, the volunteers’ health returned to normal.13[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt13]As far back as we know, the Earth’s electromagnetic field has been protectingand supporting all living things with this natural frequency pulsation of 7.83Hz. You can think of the Schumann resonance as the Earth’s heartbeat. Theancient Indian rishis referred to this as OM, or the incarnation of pure sound.Whether by coincidence or not, 7.83 Hz also happens to be a very powerfulfrequency used with brain-wave entrainment, as it is associated with low levelsof alpha and the upper range of theta brain-wave states. It is this range ofbrain waves that allows us to get beyond the analytical mind and into thesubconscious. Thus this frequency has also been associated with high levels ofsuggestibility, meditation, increased human growth hormone levels, and increasedcerebral blood-flow levels.14 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt14] It appears,then, that the Earth’s frequency and the brain’s frequency have very similarresonances and that our nervous system can be influenced by the Earth’selectromagnetic field. Perhaps this is why getting out of the city and intonature often provides such a calming effect.The Concept of EmergenceIn 1996, researchers at the HeartMath Institute discovered that when anindividual’s heart is in a state of coherence or harmonious rhythm, it radiatesa more coherent electromagnetic signal into the environment—and that this signalcan be detected by the nervous systems of other people, as well as animals. Infact, as you know by now, the heart generates the strongest magnetic field inthe body and it can be measured several feet away.15[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt15] This provides a credible explanation for thefact that when someone walks into a room, you can feel or sense thatindividual’s mood or emotional state, independent of their body language.16[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt16] From a purely scientific standpoint, we canthen ask, if this phenomenon works on an individual level, can it work on aglobal level?In 2008, more than a decade later, the HeartMath Institute launched the GlobalCoherence Initiative (GCI), a science-based, international effort that seeks tohelp activate the heart of humanity to promote peace, harmony, and a shift inglobal consciousness. GCI is based on the beliefs that: 1. Human health, thoughts, behaviors, and emotions are influenced by solar geomagnetic (the Earth’s magnetic field) activity; 2. The Earth’s magnetic field is a carrier of biologically relevant information that connects all living systems; 3. All human beings influence the Earth’s electromagnetic field of vital information; 4. Collective human consciousness where large numbers of people are intentionally focused on heart-centered states creates or affects the global information field. Therefore, elevated emotions of care, love, and peace can generate a more coherent field environment that can benefit others and help offset the current planetary discord and incoherence.17 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt17]Because human heart rhythm and brain frequencies (as well as cardiovascular andautonomic nervous systems) overlap with the Earth’s resonance field, GCIscientists suggest we are part of a biological feedback loop in which we notonly receive relevant biological information from the field, but we also feedinformation into this field.18 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt18] In otherwords, human thoughts (consciousness) and emotions (energy) interact with andencode this information into the Earth’s magnetic field, and this information isthen distributed on carrier waves (the signal on which the information isimpressed or carried) around the globe.To further their research and test this hypothesis, using state-of-the-artsensors located in various locations around the globe, the HeartMath Institutecreated the Global Coherence Monitoring System (GCMS) to observe changes in theEarth’s magnetic field. Designed to measure global coherence, the GCMS uses asystem of highly sensitive magnetometers to continuously measure magneticsignals that occur in the same range as human physiological frequencies,including our brain and cardiovascular systems. They also continuously monitoractivity caused by solar storms, flares, and solar-wind speed activity resultingfrom solar storms, disruptions of the Schumann resonances, and potentially thesignatures of major global events that have a strong emotional component.19[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt19]Why are they doing this and what does it point to? If you can intentionallycreate a coherent electromagnetic field around your body, and you are related orconnected to someone in your life who is also intentionally creating anelectromagnetic field around their body, the waves of this shared field wouldbegin to synchronize in a nonlocal way. As the waves from both individualssynchronize, they generate bigger waves and stronger magnetic fields around you,connecting you to the Earth’s electromagnetic field with an increased field ofinfluence.If we could create a community of people scattered all over the world, with eachindividual intentionally raising the energy of their own personal field towardgreater peace, isn’t it possible that this community could begin to produce aglobal effect within the Earth’s electromagnetic field? This intentionalcommunity could then create coherence where there is incoherence, and orderwhere there has been disorder.The evidence from peace-gathering studies suggests that our thoughts andfeelings do in fact have a measurable effect on every living system. You mayhave heard of this as the concept of emergence—envision the synchronicity of aschool of fish or a flock of birds flying in unison, where all creatures appearto be operating from one mind, connected by an invisible field of energy in anonlocal way. What is unique about this phenomenon is that it is not a top-downphenomenon, meaning there is no leader. Instead, it is a bottom-up phenomenon,meaning everyone is leading because they are acting as one mind. When a globalcommunity comes together in the name of peace, love, and coherence, according toemergence we should be able to produce an effect in the Earth’s electromagneticfield, as well as in each other’s fields. Just imagine, then, what it would belike if we were all behaving, living, thriving, and operating as one. If weunderstood we were of one mind—one organism connected and united throughconsciousness—we would understand that to hurt another, or affect another in anyway, is to do the same to ourselves. This new paradigm in thinking would be thelargest evolutionary leap our species has ever made, causing the need forwarring, fighting, competing, fearing, and suffering to become an antiquatedconcept. But how could this possibility become a reality?Coherence versus IncoherenceIn order for us to create some type of effect in the Earth’s field (which inturn can influence another individual’s field), as you might guess, we have toactivate two significant centers in the human body—the heart and the brain. Aswe learned in Chapter 4 [../Text/chapter04.xhtml], while the brain is of coursethe center of consciousness and awareness, the heart—the center of oneness,wholeness, and our connection to the unified field—has its own brain. Whenpeople can regulate their internal states of care, kindness, peace, love,gratitude, thankfulness, and appreciation, as their hearts become more coherentand balanced, they send a very strong signal to the brain, causing the brain tobecome more coherent and balanced. This is because the heart and the brain arein continuous communication with each other.By the same means, once someone moves beyond the association to their body,their environment, and time and takes their attention off matter and objects,they become no body, no one, no thing, no where, in no time. As you wellunderstand by now, when they get beyond themselves and put their awareness onthe immaterial world of energy, they connect to the unified field, the placewhere there’s no longer separation between any body, any one, any thing, and anywhere, in any time. This causes them to unify with the consciousness of everybody, every one, every thing, and every where in every time. As a consciousness,they have now entered the quantum field of energy and information, the placewhere consciousness and energy can influence the material world in nonlocalways.The side effect of this process is that it creates more coherence in the brainand in our energy so our biology becomes more whole. In our research, we’vefound that when the brain becomes more coherent, it affects the autonomicnervous system and the heart. The heart, our connection to the unified field,then acts like a catalyst to amplify the process of coherence back into thebrain. Because the heart sends more information to the brain than the brainsends to the heart, the more coherence you can achieve through the elevatedemotions of the heart, the more the brain and the heart synchronize. Thissynchronization produces measurable effects not only within the body, but alsowithin the electromagnetic field surrounding the body—and the bigger the fieldwe produce around our body, the more we can affect others in a nonlocal way. Howdo we know this? Because we’ve seen this over and over in our students’ HRVmeasurements.Evidence of the influence of the heart’s electromagnetic field upon the field ofanother’s heart can also be seen in a HeartMath study in which 40 participantswere divided into groups of four around 10 card tables. While the heart rhythmsof all four participants at the table were being measured, only three peoplewere trained to raise their emotions through HeartMath techniques. When thethree trained participants raised their energy and sent positive feelings to theuntrained participant, that person also went into higher states of coherence.The authors of the study concluded that “evidence of heart-to-heartsynchronization across subjects was found which lends credence to thepossibility of heart-to-heart biocommunications.”20[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt20]Key to the process of coherence is getting beyond the analytical mind. (We knowthis because we’ve measured it enough times in the brain scans of our students.Their participation has also demonstrated that with enough practice, coherencecan be achieved in a relatively short amount of time.) When the thinking brainis quieted, it moves into alpha or theta brain-wave states, and this opens thedoorway between the conscious and subconscious mind. The autonomic nervoussystem then becomes more receptive to information. By raising our energy throughthe feelings of elevated emotions, we become less matter and more energy, lessparticle and more wave. The bigger the field we can create with theseenergies—as energy, awareness, and consciousness—the more we can influenceothers in a nonlocal way.The greater energy you can create through the elevated emotions of the heart,the more you’re going to connect with the unified field, which means you’regoing to experience more wholeness, connection, and oneness. But you can’texperience that connection when you’re incoherent, feeling separate, or livingby the hormones of stress. When the chemicals released during stress arouse thebrain, we feel disconnected from the unified field and we tend to make lessevolved choices. We know without a doubt that the emotions of competition, fear,anger, unworthiness, guilt, and shame keep us separate from one another becausethey produce slower and lower frequencies than elevated emotions like love,gratitude, care, and kindness, which produce faster and higher frequencies. Wealso know that the faster the frequency, the more energy is present. Thisprompted us to ask several questions: * What if we assembled a community of several hundred people in one room, had them open their hearts and generate elevated energetic states, and then asked them to send the intention for the greatest good of a select group of people gathered in the same room? * What would happen if the electromagnetic field around each person’s body merged with the field of the person sitting next to them? * Could those elevated emotional states then begin to produce a change in energy in the room? * Is it possible that everybody experiencing elevated emotions and energy could begin to create coherence within a community?Building a Collective Coherent FieldSince early 2013, we’ve partnered with our friends at the HeartMath Institute tofurther our research. Since we began measuring our students’ physiologicalstates, we’ve scanned thousands of brains and hearts, resulting in a significantamount of information. We have been overwhelmed and mystified by some of thedata we’ve collected when common people start doing the uncommon.Over the course of this journey, in collaboration with HeartMath, we’vewitnessed amazing measurements in our students. We’ve taken equally amazingmeasurements of the collective energy in the rooms where our students havegathered—measurements that show consistent, daily increases in energy—using asophisticated sensor from Russia called Sputnik (mentioned briefly in Chapter 2[../Text/chapter02.xhtml]).Since elevated emotions, related to the activity of the autonomic nervoussystem, produce electromagnetic fields, increasing those emotions results inchanges in blood microcirculation, perspiration, and other functions of thebody. Because Sputnik is so sensitive, it can quantify environmentalfluctuations by measuring barometric shifts, relative humidity, air temperature,electromagnetic fields, and more.21 [../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt21]Take a look at Graphics 15A and 15B in the color insert. In these measurementsfrom our workshops, you can see a trend that demonstrates an increase in thecollective energy of the room. The first line in red is our baseline measurementand shows the room’s energy before the start of the event. As you look at thered, blue, green, and finally the brown lines (each color representing adifferent day), you can see that each day the energy steadily increases. InGraphics 15C and 15D, the same color scale applies; however, these measurementsreflect specific time intervals during each day’s morning meditations. Thismeans our students are getting better at raising the energy of the room bycreating more unified coherence.The Sputnik readings demonstrate that the collective energy created by ourstudents from the first day of the workshop to the final day consistently makesincremental increases. Within that trend, we’ve found that most groups areextremely focused and the energy rises every day. About one-quarter of the time,the energy stays relatively the same for the first day or two, but in thefollowing days, the energy increases significantly. We believe this is becauseduring the first day or two, the group is working on overcoming themselves bybreaking the energetic emotional bonds that keep them connected to theirpast-present reality. So during this time, they are drawing from the unifiedfield to build their own personal electromagnetic fields. This siphoning fromthe field tends to cause the collective energy in the room to drop. But oncethose individual fields become greater, more enhanced, and coherent, theyentrain to one another, which is when we tend to see dramatic increases in theenergy of the room.Figure 13.2 shows that when two coherent waves come together, they create abigger wave. This is called constructive interference. The bigger the wave, thehigher the amplitude of energy. As a result of our students’ more coherent wavescoming together during our workshops, the energy of the group field increases,and then there’s more energy to heal and to create or access greater levels ofmind, which can sometimes lead to mystical experiences.image [../Images/p356.jpg]Constructive interference is when two coherent waves come together to create abigger wave. Amplitude is the measurement of the height of a wave. The higherthe amplitude, the higher the energy. If a community of people are all gatheredand are creating coherent electromagnetic fields, when their energies interfere,it makes sense that the energy of the room will increase.My team and I have been consistently humbled by our students’ profound healings,their ability to increase and regulate elevated states, and their reports ofmystical experiences or acute insights into their lives as a result of learninghow to regulate their brain waves, open their hearts, and go into coherence.Some of these occurrences could be labeled as miracles, but we believe it’s justa part of the process of becoming supernatural. This led us to wonder if ourstudents could affect the nervous systems of others, and if so, what theimplications of that would be. These questions would spark the birth of ProjectCoherence.Project CoherenceIn collaboration with the HeartMath Institute, we performed numerous experimentswhereby we took a small, random sampling of about 50 to 75 people at ouradvanced workshops, attached HRV monitors to their chests, and placed them inthe front row of the room for three meditations over the course of 24 hours.Since HRV not only provides insight into the coherence of the heart, but alsogives us information about the brain and emotions, we wanted to measuresubjects’ HRV for a full 24 hours.To start the meditation, everyone in the room placed their attention on theirheart center and began breathing through this center slowly and deeply, as youlearned to do in Chapter 7 [../Text/chapter07.xhtml]. Next, they cultivated andsustained an elevated emotion for two to three minutes, broadening their hearts’electromagnetic fields and moving from a state of selfishness to a state ofselflessness. Then we had the collective of 550 to 1,500 students broadcast theenergy of their elevated emotions beyond their body into the space of the entireroom. Next, we had them lay the intentional thought in that frequency for thegreatest good of the students sitting in the front of the room wearing the HRVmonitors—that their lives be enriched, their bodies be healed, and mysticalexperiences find them.Our goal was to measure the collective energy in the room and its potentialnonlocal effect on the people wearing the HRV monitors. Could those elevatedlevels of energy and frequency in the form of love, gratitude, wholeness, andjoy cause another person’s heart to go into coherence—even if they were on theother side of the room? Our results confirmed our hypothesis. Not only did thebroadcast energy produce a coherent effect on the people wearing the HRVmonitors, but each of their hearts went into coherence at the exact same time,in the exact same meditation, on the exact same day—and this was not a one-timeoccurrence. We repeatedly found consistent results across our events. What doesthis mean?Our data supports the HeartMath Global Coherence Initiative’s belief that aninvisible field exists upon which information is communicated. This field linksand influences all living systems, as well as our collective humanconsciousness. Because of this field, information is communicated nonlocallybetween people at a subconscious level through the autonomic nervous system.22[../Text/endnotes.xhtml#ch13_nt22] In other words, we are bound and connected byan invisible field of energy, and this energy field can affect everyone’sbehaviors, emotional states, and conscious and unconscious thoughts.Because all frequency carries information, the magnetic fields produced in thehearts of the student body acted as carrier waves for this information. If atour workshops we can produce nonlocal effects on others, shouldn’t our elevated,heart-centered emotions be able to produce nonlocal effects on our children,partners, coworkers, or anyone we have a relationship or share a connectionwith?If you look at Figure 13.3, you notice 17 people going into heart coherence atthe exact same time, on the exact same day, during the exact same meditation.All of these students who went into heart coherence were being entrained by theenergy of others. The students sending the energy embraced the intention for thegreatest good of those people wearing the heart rate monitors. The results showthat when we get out of our own way, we can become one mind and nonlocallyconnect to one another. Through that connection, we can influence the autonomicnervous system of others so they will feel more balanced, coherent, and whole.Imagine what could happen if you had thousands of people all doing the same forthe entire world.Shortly after these global meditation events, our students began sending use-mails asking that since we showed that we could indeed create a measurablechange in the energy of a room where 550 to 1,500 people were gathered, could wethen produce the same effect on a global scale? So it was our students whorequested we organize global meditations, giving birth to Project Coherence. Webroadcast our first Project Coherence over Facebook in November 2015, with morethan 6,000 people from all over the world joining together online tocollectively create a more loving and peaceful world. In our second meditation,more than 36,000 online viewers participated, and in our third globalmeditation, more than 43,000 joined forces. It is our intention to continue tohost these Project Coherence events, each time creating a stronger radiatinginfluence of peace and love over the planet. In time, we hope to measure theseeffects.image [../Images/p359.jpg]Figure 13.3. This is a graph showing 17 people going into heart coherence at theexact same time, on the exact same day, during the exact same meditation. Thearea between the vertical lines shows everyone going into heart coherence.Project Coherence MeditationStart by acknowledging your heart center. With focus and awareness, lock intothat center, open your focus, and begin to become aware of the space it occupiesin space, as well as the space around the space your heart occupies in space.Then move as a thought and an awareness into the center of the Earth and radiateyour light beyond the Earth in space. All I want you to do is raise yourfrequency and hold on to that emotion. Still as a consciousness and awareness,slowly move away from the Earth, and then take the Earth as a thought and placeit in your heart. As you hold the entire planet in your heart, raise thefrequency of the Earth as a thought, and broadcast that energy beyond your bodyin space. Radiate your love into the Earth."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/taj.jpg]Chapter 14 [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t14]image [../Images/line.jpg]CASE STUDIES: IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t14]image [../Images/line.jpg]In this final set of supernatural case studies, please note that none of thepeople you will read about here tried to make anything happen. They simply hadan intention and at the same time surrendered the outcome to something greater.When they hit that moment—whether it was a healing or a mysticalexperience—their personality wasn’t creating the experience. Something greatercame through them and did it for them. They connected to the unified field, andit was their interaction with this intelligence that moved them in some way. Asyou know by now after everything you have read in this book, that intelligencealso lives within you.Divine, Can You Hear Me?In 2014, Stacy began experiencing severe headaches. For 25 years, she had workedin health care, as both a registered nurse and an acupuncturist. She had alwaysmaintained a healthy lifestyle and rarely took medications, so the suddenappearance of headaches so excruciating they nearly caused her to black out wasalarming. After a year of exploring countless alternative therapies, she finallywent to a doctor who ordered a CAT scan.The diagnosis was a meningioma, a benign tumor that wraps around certain nervetissue in the spinal nerves. Stacy’s was sitting on or near her eighth cranialnerve, which began obstructing her acoustic nerve and creating significantchanges in her neurological functions. The acoustic nerve has two branches—onefor hearing and the other for balance—so in addition to unrelenting pain andloss of hearing, she was dizzy and nauseated. As the lesion grew, it also beganpushing against another cranial nerve that ran along her face and continued downinto her shoulder, resulting in a diagnosis of pitcher’s shoulder. Soon, shealso experienced pain in her eye.According to her physician, the only solution was a craniotomy, which basicallyentailed drilling a large hole in the back of her head to remove the tumor.Stacy did not want to pursue this path, so she continued exploring other healingmodalities. By the time she attended her first weekend workshop in Seattle in2015, she estimated she had lost 70 percent of her hearing in her left ear. Inthe fall of 2016, she attended her first advanced workshop in Cancun, where shefelt herself surrender at a whole new level. Then, in the winter of 2017, sheattended another advanced workshop in Tampa.On Thursday, she had a very intense earache that became much worse the next day.She said the sensation she felt was that her ear was closing up. By the end ofthat day, after the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation, her earachecuriously ended. Then on Sunday morning during the pineal gland meditation,Stacy lost track of time and space.“I almost felt like I was going to fall off my chair,” she said. “In thatmoment, this amazing flash of light consumed the left side of my head. Imagineif you put a thousand diamonds together and shined a light on them—that wouldn’teven begin to touch this light. Then—boom!” Her body shot upright and abluish-white light, like nothing she had ever seen or experienced, entered herear.“It was the most divine, loving feeling that I’ve ever had,” she reported. “Ifelt like the hand of God was caressing me with grace. It was so powerful andamazing that I struggle to put it into words, but every time I think of it, Istill cry.”First, her sinuses cleared, then the whole left side of her head cleared, andthen her left shoulder relaxed and let go. Finally, for the first time in threeyears, she could hear out of her left ear.“I just sat there in awe, laughing and crying as tears flowed down my face,” shesaid. “Music was playing and I could hear it crystal clear. It was as if I couldhear the celestial sound of angels singing above the song. I knew what I washearing was beyond the normal auditory range. The energy continued to movethrough the back of the left side of my head, which for years had felt likecement.”When I instructed everyone to lie down, relax, and let the autonomic nervoussystem take the orders, the energy continued to move through Stacy’s whole body,down her arms, and into her hands. She began to shake uncontrollably.“It was as if I could feel every synapse and muscle in my body firing—in mytoes, my legs, my head, and my neck and chest. My heart center felt wide open. Ijust remember thinking, Whatever this is, I’m taking the ride.” She completelysurrendered to the unknown and once again, she lost track of time and space.When that portion of the meditation ended, she found herself sitting in herchair, with the energy slowing and quieting down. Her thinking brain began tokick in. Even though she could hear, she began to doubt what had just occurred;perhaps her ear was not totally healed, perhaps the tumor was still present, orperhaps she wasn’t even worthy of healing. No sooner did she have that thoughtthan the energy and light appeared in front of her. But this energy wasdifferent.“It was red like the heart and blue like energy, and it was three-dimensional,”she remembered. “It was about two feet in front of me and was almost slitheringlike a snake. All this was happening with my eyes closed. It wasmultidimensional, beautiful, crazy, gorgeous, fractal, and it came right up tomy face. It was almost as if this energy wanted to say, ‘You have doubts? We’llshow you!’ Then it shot into my heart, my chest opened up, I sat back on thechair, and my arms fell wide open. I knew it was the energy of everything—theenergy of chi, of Spirit, of the divine, of the universe.“Life is different now,” she told me. “For one, my hearing is at a hundredpercent. But it’s more than that. It’s hard to put into words, but I know thatno matter what, I’m going to be okay. Life will never be the same because I knowunderneath everything, it’s Spirit who is looking to be heard and healed.”Janet Hears “You Are Mine”While Janet occasionally meditated, it was never a regular habit—yet oneafternoon 25 years ago during a meditation, she had what she calls a spontaneousexperience. With her eyes closed, she was suddenly in the presence of anincredibly bright light, yet the light had a softness that didn’t hurt her eyes.She described it as the purest, most intense, perfect love she had everexperienced. For the next 25 years, she prayed, meditated, and did everythingelse she could to try to re-create that transcendental experience.In the spring of 2015, Janet attended an advanced workshop in Carefree, Arizona.She was in a state of deep depression and exhaustion, unable to see anysolutions to the problems in her life, yet she was determined to have a healingor breakthrough. Above all else, she was excited to be with more than 500 peopleunited in the belief that they were greater than their physical bodies.For the duration of the workshop, Janet went after the mystical with a level ofintensity that was greater than her depression. During the pineal glandmeditation, she was sitting in the lotus position and resting her lovingintention in the space of her pineal gland. All of a sudden the gland activatedand a brilliant white light coming from inside her head illuminated her pinealgland. It was the same light she had experienced 25 years earlier.“The light came into the space of my pineal gland and illuminated all of thecrystals in the little cave of that tiny gland,” she later explained. “The lightcontinued to illuminate my entire being down to the cellular level. My spinethen straightened, my head went back, and I just embraced it—I just let it allhappen. I was simultaneously in ecstasy, bliss, gratitude, and love.”Next an inverted triangle of light came down from above her, through the top ofher head. She knew this triangle was the presence of a loving intelligence. Thepoint of the inverted triangle joined the peak of her pineal gland, forming adouble-geometric shape. The intense frequency of coherent light was carrying amessage for Janet. The light kept saying to Janet over and over, “You are mine.You are mine,” which she took to mean, “I love you more than anything else inthe world.”“Please enter and take charge of my life,” Janet responded, and as shesurrendered to it, she started to experience a download of information comingthrough the top of her head in the form of the brilliant light. The light wasthreaded with strands that looked like luminous cobalt-blue pearls. The lightmoved slowly and descended through her entire body. This energy was the resultof a reverse torus field (the field that moves in the opposite direction of theupward field created during the breath), and it was energy from the unifiedfield—from beyond the visible light spectrum and beyond our senses. The innerexperience was so real that it rewired her brain and sent a new emotionalenergetic signal to her body, and in an instant her past was washed away. Thedownload of the frequency of coherence and wholeness gave her body a biologicalupgrade. By the time she left the workshop, her depression and her exhaustionwere completely gone. “This ecstatic experience,” she insisted, “has changed mylife forever.”Connected beyond Time and Space by LoveDuring a Project Coherence meditation broadcast from Lake Garda, Italy,participants from all over the world joined us in the belief that we are morethan just matter, bodies, and particles and that consciousness influences matterand the world. During the meditation, Sasha was in New Jersey visualizingbringing the Earth into her heart.“When we went to the heart, I felt all of these shoots and leaves growing frommy heart center and through my body,” she told me. “There were branches, leaves,and blossoms coming out my arms, fingers, and ears, as well as white blossomsall over my face. I had literally become the surface of the Earth garden.”As soon as the meditation was over, Sasha looked down at her phone and saw thather best friend, Heather, had sent her a picture from Ireland. While we had beendoing the meditation, Heather had been walking through a garden. She happened tolook down and saw moss growing on a rock in the shape of a heart. Heather took apicture of the moss with her phone and sent it to Sasha with a note that said,“Saw this and had the overwhelming feeling of your presence. Love you.”Donna Helps Souls Cross OverWhen Donna attended her first weekend workshop in 2014 in Long Beach,California, she never would have called herself a meditator—she’d only meditateda handful of times before. A technical writer, she had a very analytical mind.But that’s the beauty of this work: When you have no expectations, you are oftenmore open to wherever the experience takes you. So she was totally taken bysurprise when at some point during one of her meditations that weekend, sheslipped out of her everyday consciousness and found herself surrounded byhundreds of interdimensional beings.“They weren’t angry or malevolent,” she told me, “but it was very clear to methat they wanted something from me. Some of them were fairly young—like 12 or13. I knew immediately they were the people my fiancé had killed.”Donna was engaged to a former United States Army Ranger, and during his servicein Iraq, he’d been a sniper. When Donna returned home from the workshop and toldher fiancé about her experience, he confirmed that some of the people he killedto protect his fellow soldiers were quite young.While she found the connection curious and fascinating, she didn’t know what todo with the information, but there was no question in her mind that theexperience was real because it was beyond anything she could have simplyconjured.Two years later, Donna was at an advanced workshop in Carefree, Arizona. Aftercompleting the first meditation, she turned to a friend sitting next to her andsaid in a daze, without even being aware of what she was saying, “There arebeings in this room, and they are here to help us.”Early Sunday morning, for the pineal gland meditation, Donna was slated to haveher brain scanned. Once again, at some point during the meditation, Donna foundherself suddenly in the company of the same interdimensional beings who hadsurrounded her during her first workshop two years earlier. But this time theywere standing in a line off to her right.“Again, I felt like they wanted something from me, but I didn’t know what itwas,” she said. “Then, in my mind’s eye, as though I was looking through avirtual-reality headset, I saw another line forming on my left. There were twotypes of beings in this line. One type looked human-like, but they were verylarge and had a shimmering golden look, and the other type seemed to have a bluehue to them.”She innately knew that if she took the people who were killed by her fiancé inthe war, who were lined up on the right, and gave them to the beings on theleft, the people on the right would receive what they needed. Because the peoplewho had been killed by sniper fire had died so suddenly, without any warning,some were confused about whether they were alive or dead. Some weren’t surewhere to go or what to do, while others were trying to stay in this dimensionbecause they were attached to their loved ones and couldn’t move on. They werestuck in between matter and light, yet somehow they recognized that Donna wasthe bridge, or the facilitator, who could help them cross over. And it was allhappening in a very real, very lucid experience.“To say I handed them over to the other beings is not quite right,” sheexplained, “but it was something like me passing them over. It’s really beyondlanguage, but when they passed to the other side, it seemed like they passedthrough the other beings. And then I could see them running across a field ofwaist-high red mist. I could feel all the freedom, joy, and happiness they wereexperiencing as they ran across this field.”Again, as if looking through a virtual-reality headset, Donna turned to theright in her mind’s eye and saw a winding dirt road filled with peoplestretching far into the distance. She sensed they were from Bosnia and Serbia,which she couldn’t quite make sense of.“It felt almost as if the word got out. I didn’t have the sense that they wereunaware they were dead. It was more like they were stuck in limbo—they didn’tknow how to get to the other side.” This was the longest meditation of theworkshop, perhaps two to three hours, but to Donna, it seemed like it was tenminutes.Donna attended another advanced workshop in Cancun in the fall of 2016. Thistime, when I asked the students to surrender their consciousness to merge withthe consciousness of the unified field, Donna had the experience of becoming theuniverse. She went from the consciousness of some body, some thing, some one,some where, in some time, to the consciousness of no body, no thing, no one, nowhere, in no time, to the consciousness of every body, every thing, every one,every where, in every time. In the instant her consciousness connected with theunified field—the field of information that governs the laws and forces of theuniverse—she became the universe. She was in bliss.“Since that experience, my life has become magical and I’m experiencing a newenergy and vitality like never before,” she reported later. “I keep having onepowerful experience after another, and I can never go back to the way my lifewas before starting to practice this work.”Jerry Returns from the Brink of DeathOn August 14, 2015, Jerry was putting a project together on his back deck. As hewas reading the directions, he felt a sudden sharp pain right below his sternum.He thought perhaps it was gas, so he took some medication, but it didn’t goaway. Instead, he lay down to rest and it got worse.By the time he tried to get up, he started losing his ability to stand andthought he might pass out. As the pain became more intense and his breathinggrew shorter, he called an ambulance. With all his might, he dragged himselfabout 15 feet outside to the driveway so the paramedics wouldn’t have to kick inhis door. Kneeling on the driveway, he collapsed waiting for the emergencymedical technicians. When they arrived, they assumed he was having a heartattack and immediately began to follow that protocol.“You guys don’t understand. I’m having a really hard time breathing,” he toldthem. “We have to get to the hospital right away.” Jerry knew what he wastalking about. He’d worked for 34 years as a medical technician in the veryemergency room where they were about to take him.Jerry knew everyone in the ER, and once he arrived, doctors, nurses,technicians, and specialists began frantically running lab work on him. When adoctor who was also Jerry’s friend told Jerry that red flags had come up inevery test administered, Jerry knew things were not looking good. One test inparticular was particularly alarming; his levels of protease, amylase, andlipase (enzymes produced by the pancreas) were 4,000 to 5,000 units per liter,way above the norm of about 100 to 200. They put Jerry in the intensive careunit.“The pain soon worsened, and none of the drugs they were giving me worked,”Jerry said. “They told me that a duct to my gallbladder had been blocked and itwas causing trouble in my pancreas. Worst of all, fluid started to develop in mylungs. I was now down 80 percent breathing capacity in both lungs. That’s whenthe doctors put me on a ventilator, and I knew things were bad.” The doctor thenasked his team to “turn on the TV to Boston,” allowing the doctor to have animmediate teleconference with other doctors in a larger hospital in the nearestbig city.“In all the time I’d worked at the hospital, I’d only seen the TV to Boston comeon a few times for the most serious of traumas or for people who were dying,”Jerry said. “It means they have no idea what is happening. When a doctor youhave trusted for years tells you they don’t know what’s going on . . . well,that’s when my stress hormones started to kick into high gear.” While all ofthis was happening, the medical staff told Jerry’s wife that if there was anyend-of-life paperwork she needed to get in order, now would be the time to gohome and get it. She left sobbing.Jerry soon realized he needed to start taking care of himself. He knew that ifhe allowed the stress hormones to start taking over, he was not going to win.“I went from being a guy who hadn’t been sick in years, who did yoga all thetime and ate well, to all of a sudden being in the ICU. I kept telling myself, Ican’t go down this road. I can’t give in to the fear—so I didn’t.” Since he’drecently read my book You Are the Placebo, he started thinking, I gotta changethese thought patterns. I can’t allow these thoughts to make more cortisol toget into the body and start doing more damage to what’s left of me.The doctors eventually found out that Jerry had a large mass blocking a duct inhis pancreas. The mass was not letting the mucus drain, so everything in thegland was backing up and spilling over into his bloodstream.“My doctors stayed with me for three days straight,” he says. “They put anoxygen mask on me because I couldn’t breathe. I had IVs on both sides, andmeanwhile, I kept thinking, Watch your thoughts, relax, put something into thequantum field that’s going to help you and not hurt you, because you’re alreadyknocking on the door. I’m gonna be okay. This too shall pass. I’m gonna be allright.” Whenever he was conscious, Jerry placed his energy on overcominghimself, changing his state of being, and creating a differentoutcome—constantly tuning in to a different potential in the unified field.Fortunately, he had a private room, giving him plenty of opportunity to do hismeditations whenever he wanted to.Jerry spent a week in the ICU, and by the end of that time when he moved to aprogressive care unit, the oxygen mask was gone and Jerry was walking around.Even so, he could not eat or drink anything for nine weeks. (If he ate anything,or even had water, his pancreas would release acid into his body, eventuallykilling him.) The only nourishment he received was through an IV.When Jerry was admitted to the hospital, he weighed 145 pounds. When he wasdischarged, he weighed 119. When he finally went home (still with an IV pole),he continued to do the work. As October drew near, the mass was still present.His doctors suggested he see a specialist in Boston to undergo surgery. BecauseJerry was a medical professional, two days before the surgery he suggested hismedical team take some more tests and scans so the doctors would have the mostup-to-date information.“I know all the x-ray technicians and yet when they told me I no longer had amass, I didn’t believe them. I called in the radiologists and the doctors. Theyjust kept saying, ‘Jerry, we’re looking at your film right now. We’re tellingyou, there’s nothing there. I’m calling the guys in Boston to tell them therewill be no surgery.’”Jerry later realized that by constantly raising his energy, moving into afeeling of health, and changing the thoughts and belief that he was sick to thethoughts and belief he was going to be fine, the higher frequency caused him toheal.“I wasn’t going to allow myself to think, Woe is me. This is gonna be bad. Ikept working on this every day, for as much of the day as I could. I put theright message, intention, and energy out into the quantum field to healmyself—and eventually, I did.”"},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/line.jpg]AFTERWORD [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t15]Being Peace [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t15]image [../Images/line.jpg]What I hope you take away from this book is that it’s not enough to change yourstate of being only when you meditate. It’s not sufficient to just think andfeel peace with your eyes closed, and then open them and carry on throughout theday in limited, unconscious states of mind and body. In many of thepeace-gathering projects and studies mentioned in Chapter 13[../Text/chapter13.xhtml], when the experiments concluded, very often thereduced violence and crime returned to their former baseline levels. This meansthat we actually have to demonstrate peace, which requires us to get our bodiesinvolved, and that means we have to move from thinking to doing.Every time we change our state of being and begin our day by opening our heartsto the elevated states that connect us to a love for life, a joy for existence,the inspiration to be alive, a state of gratitude that our future has alreadyhappened, and a level of kindness toward others, we must carry, maintain, anddemonstrate that energy and state of being throughout the day—whether we aresitting, standing, walking, or lying down. Then, when upsetting events occur inour lives or in the world, if we demonstrate peace rather than unconsciously actin predictable, so-called natural reactionary ways (expressing anger,frustration, violence, fear, suffering, or aggression), we are no longercontributing to the world’s old consciousness. By breaking that cycle anddemonstrating peace by example, we give others permission to do the same.Because knowledge is for the mind and experience is for the body, when we movefrom thinking to doing—and experience the corresponding emotions of peace andinner balance—the moment we begin to embody peace is when we really begin tochange the program.By tempering those reactive behaviors, and thus no longer creating the sameredundant experiences and emotions, we no longer fire and wire the same circuitsin the brain. This is how we cease conditioning the body to live in theself-limiting emotions of the mind, and this is how we change ourselves and ourrelationship to the world around us. Every time we do this, we are literallyteaching our body to chemically understand what our mind has intellectuallyunderstood. This is how we select and instruct the latent genes that cause us tothrive—not just survive. Now peace is within us and we are knocking on thegenetic door to biologically become exactly that. Isn’t that what every greatcharismatic leader, saint, mystic, and master throughout history has continuallypreached?Of course, it’s going to feel unnatural in the beginning to go against years ofautomatic conditioning, unconscious habits, reflexive emotional reactions,hardwired attitudes, and generations of genetic programming, but that is exactlyhow we become supernatural. To do what feels unnatural means going against howwe have all been genetically programmed or socially conditioned to live when weare threatened in some way. I’m sure any creature that has broken from theconsciousness of the tribe, the pack, the school, or the herd in order to adaptto a changing environment must have felt the discomfort and uncertainty of theunknown. But let’s not forget that living in the unknown means we are in therealm of possibility.The real challenge is not to return to the level of mediocrity that theprevailing social consciousness agrees on merely because we don’t see anyoneelse doing what we are doing. True leadership never needs confirmation fromothers. It just requires a clear vision and a change in energy—that is, a newstate of being—that is sustained for a long enough period of time and executedwith a strong enough will that it causes others to raise their own energy andbecome inspired to do the same. Once they do raise themselves from their ownlimited state of being to a new energy, they see the same future that theirleader sees. There is power in numbers.After all my years of teaching people about personal transformation, I know noone changes until they change their energy. In fact, when someone is trulyengaged in change, they are less likely to talk about it and more prone todemonstrate it. They are working on living it. This requires awareness, intent,staying present, and constant attention to their inner states. Perhaps thebiggest hurdle is not only being uncomfortable but also being okay with beinguncomfortable, because discomfort is our challenge to grow. It makes us feelmore alive.After all, if stress and the survival response are the result of not being ableto predict our future (thinking or believing that we are unable to control anoutcome or that things are going to get worse), then opening our minds andhearts to believe in possibility requires going against thousands of years ofgenetically hardwired survival traits. We must lay down the very thing that wehave always used to get what we want for something much better to occur. To me,that’s true greatness.If we can do it once, disturb those neural networks equated with anger,resentment, and retribution and instead activate the neural networks related toexperiences of caring, giving, and nurturing (and so create the correspondingemotions), then we should be able do it again—and the repetition of thesechoices will neurochemically condition our mind and body to become one. When thebody knows how to do this as well as the mind, it becomes innate, familiar,easy, and second nature. Then, thinking and demonstrating peace, which oncerequired focused awareness, becomes a subconscious program. Now we’ve created anew, automatic peaceful state of being, and again, that means that now peace iswithin us.This is how we memorize a new internal neurochemical order that’s greater thanany conditions in our external environment. Now we’re not just being peace, butmastering it, as well as mastering ourselves and our environment. Once enough ofus can achieve this state of being—once everybody is locked into the sameenergy, frequency, and elevated consciousness—just like schools of fish orflocks of birds moving as one in a unified order, we’ll begin to act as one mindand emerge as a new species. But if we continue to act as a cancerous organismat war with itself, our species will not survive, and evolution will continueits grand experiment.Take time out of your busy life to invest in yourself, because when you do, youare investing in your future. If your familiar environment is controlling howyou think and feel, it’s time to retreat from your life and go inward so you canreverse the process of being a victim of life and instead become a creator ofit. After reading this book, by now you know that it’s possible to changeyourself from within and that when you do, it will be reflected in your outerworld.This is a time in history when it is not enough to simply know; this is a timeto know how. According to the philosophical understanding and scientificprinciples of quantum physics, neuroscience, and epigenetics, we now understandthat our subjective mind influences the objective world. Because mind influencesmatter, we are compelled to study the nature of mind; our understanding thenallows us to assign meaning to what we’re doing. If knowledge is the precursorto experience, then the more knowledge we have about how powerful we are, aswell as understanding the science behind how things work, the more we canunderstand the limitlessness of our potential, both as individuals and as acollective.Because we are constantly deepening and broadening our understanding of theinterconnectedness of all living systems, and because each of us is acontributor to the Earth’s field, I believe we can collectively create and guidea new, peaceful, and prosperous future upon this planet. It all begins by makinga habit of practicing leading with our hearts, raising our energy, and tuning into greater information and frequencies of love and wholeness. With effort andintention, we should begin to produce a coherent electromagnetic signature. Justlike dropping pebbles in a still lake over and over, as we continue to raise ourenergy and open our hearts, we’re producing bigger and bigger electromagneticfields. This energy is information, and we each have the power to direct ourenergy with intention to produce nonlocal effects on the nature of reality.When we direct our energy as an observer, a consciousness, or a thought, we canbegin to affect a downward causation of matter—in other words, we can literallymake our minds matter. When we practice these concepts on a consistentbasis—changing our levels of energy from survival states to greater levels ofawareness, compassion, love, gratitude, and other elevated emotions—thesecoherent electromagnetic signatures entrain to one another. The effect shouldthen be that we can unify communities that were once separated by the beliefthat we are just matter. Once we transition our state of being from survivalinto love, gratitude, and creation, then instead of reacting to violence,terrorism, fear, prejudice, competition, selfishness, and separation (which, bythe way, the media, commercials, video games, and all types of stimulation areconstantly reminding and programming us to live within), we can come togetherduring crisis. We will have no further need for splintering, assigning blame, orseeking revenge.Every time we meditate as a global community, we’re casting a larger, strongercoherent wave of love and altruism around the world. If we do this enough times,we should be able to not only measure the changes in energy and frequency aroundthe world, but measure our efforts by the positive changes in the events thattake place in our future.To stand up for justice and peace, then, you must first find peace withinyourself. You must then demonstrate peace to others, which means you can’t makea stand for peace or be peace while you’re warring with your neighbor, hatingyour coworker, or judging your boss.If everybody (and I mean every body) chose peace, and if we came together at theexact same time, imagine the type of positive change we could create in ourcollective future. There would be no conflict. What’s equally powerful is thatwhen we are the living embodiment of peace, we show up as unpredictable toothers and then they pay attention. Thanks to mirror neurons (a special class ofbrain cells that fire when we see someone perform an action), we arebiologically wired to mimic each other’s behavior. Modeling peace, justice,love, kindness, care, understanding, and compassion allows others to open theirhearts and move from fearful, aggressive states of survival to feeling wholenessand connectedness. Think what would happen if we all understood howinterconnected we were to one another and to the field, rather than feelingseparated and isolated: We might actually begin to take responsibility for ourthoughts and emotions because we would finally understand how our state of beingaffects all of life. This is how we begin to change the world—by first changingourselves.The future of humanity does not rest on one person, leader, or messiah with agreater consciousness to show us the way. Rather, it requires the evolution of anew collective consciousness, because it is through the acknowledgment andapplication of the interconnectedness of human consciousness that we can changethe course of history.While it appears old structures and paradigms are collapsing, we should not facethis with fear, anger, or sadness, because this is the process by whichevolution and new things occur. Instead we should face the future with a wholenew light, energy, and consciousness. As I have mentioned, the old has to fallapart and fall away before something new flourishes. Integral to this process isnot squandering our energy by emotionally reacting to leaders or people inpower. When they capture our emotions, they capture our attention, and thus theyhave captured our energy. This is how people gain power over us. Instead we mustmake a stand for principles, values, and moral imperatives like freedom,justice, truth, and equality. When we achieve this through the power of thecollective, we will unite behind the energy of oneness rather than be controlledby the idea of separation. This is when standing up for truth is no longerpersonal, but through unifying and building community, becomes universal.I believe we are on the verge of a great evolutionary jump. Another way to sayit is that we are going through an initiation. After all, isn’t an initiation arite of passage from one level of consciousness to another, and isn’t itdesigned to challenge the fabric of who we are so we can grow to a greaterpotential? Maybe when we see, remember, and awaken to who we truly are, humanbeings can move as a collective consciousness from a state of surviving into astate of thriving. It’s then that we can emerge into our true nature and fullyaccess our innate capacity as human beings—which is to give, to love, to serve,and to take care of one another and the Earth.So why not ask yourself every day, What would love do?This is who we really are, and this is the future I’m creating—one in which eachand every one of us becomes supernatural."},{"pageContent":"image [../Images/line.jpg]ACKNOWLEDGMENTS [../Text/content-toc.xhtml#t16]image [../Images/line.jpg]The conception of Becoming Supernatural came out of an impromptu conversationwith the powers that be at Hay House a few years ago. Little did I know when Iwas sharing a meal with CEO Reid Tracy, CFO Margarete Nielsen, and vicepresident Patty Gift that I would be talking about some ideas I had beenconsidering for a new book.Upon reflection, I think I might have been set up. Hindsight is 20-20.Something I said must have impressed them because a week later, I agreed to givebirth to a book that would be based on new paradigms that I felt would take anenormous amount of effort to write in a simple and coherent manner. Theaccumulation of continuous research, ongoing data gathering, rigorousmeasurements and analysis, concise organizational logistics, event planning,scheduling thousands of scientific scans during our events, and tireless hoursof intense dialogue with scientists as well as my team about our measurementsare not for the faint of heart. Since so much of what we were observing felloutside of scientific convention, it required making a lot of time to meet withme—and a passionate commitment to wrap our minds around such novelty.It takes a great type of person to stay the course and believe in a vision thatexists in the mind of someone else, especially when that abstraction may noteven be clear in their own minds. But when there is a steadfast conviction inpossibility combined with a passion to make something a tangible reality, magichappens. And that’s where I have had the privilege to work with amazing peoplewho have unified as a team. It has been a true blessing for me to be part ofsuch an amazing culture of people.Once again, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Hay House familyfor their trust and confidence in me. It is a joy to be a part of such acommunity of kindred spirits who demonstrate such kindness, support, andcompetence. Thank you Reid Tracy, Patty Gift, Margarete Nielsen, Stacey Smith,Richelle Fredson, Lindsay McGinty, Blaine Tod-field, Perry Crowe, CelestePhillips, Tricia Breidenthal, Diane Thomas, Sheridan McCarthy, Caroline DiNofia,Karim Garcia, Marlene Robinson, Lisa Bernier, Michael Goldstein, Joan D.Shapiro, and the rest of the family. I hope that we have all grown from workingtogether.Special thanks to my Hay House editor Anne Barthel, who lives life with suchelegance and grace.
