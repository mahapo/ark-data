It’s the organof personality, character, intelligence, and every decision you make. From mybrain-imaging work with tens of thousands of patients worldwide over the past 20years, it is very clear to me that when your brain works right, you work right,and when your brain is troubled, you are much more likely to have trouble inyour life.With a healthier brain, you are happier, physically healthier, wealthier, wiser,and just make better decisions, which helps you be more successful and livelonger. When the brain is not healthy for whatever reason—such as a head injuryor past emotional trauma—people are sadder, sicker, poorer, less wise, and lesssuccessful.It is easy to understand how trauma can hurt the brain, but researchers havealso seen how negative thinking and bad programming from our past can alsoaffect it.For example, I grew up with an older brother who was intent on shoving mearound. The constant tension and fear I felt then led to a higher level ofanxiety, anxious thinking patterns, and always being on guard, never knowingwhen something bad was about to happen. This fear caused long-term overactivityin my brain’s fear centers, until I was able to work through it later on inlife.In Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself, my colleague Dr. Joe Dispenza is yourguide to optimize both the hardware and software of your brain to help you reacha new state of mind. His new book is based on solid science, and he continues tospeak with kindness and wisdom, as he did in the award-winning film What theBLEEP Do We Know!? and in his first book, Evolve Your Brain.Even though I think of the brain like a computer, with both hardware andsoftware, the hardware (the actual physical functioning of the brain) is notseparate from the software or the constant programming and reshaping that occursthroughout our lives. They have a dramatic impact on each other. Most of us have had trauma of some kind in our lives and live with theday-to-day scars that have resulted. Cleaning out those experiences that havebecome part of the brain’s structure can be incredibly healing. Of course,engaging in brain-healthy habits, such as a proper diet and exercise and certainbrain nutrients, is critical to the brain working right. But in addition, yourmoment-by-moment thoughts exert a powerful healing effect on the brain … or theycan work to your detriment. The same is true for past experiences that canbecome wired in the brain.The study we do at the Amen Clinics is called “brain SPECT imaging.” SPECT(single-photon emission computed tomography) is a nuclear-medicine study thatlooks at blood flow and activity patterns. It is different from CT scans or MRI,which examine the brain’s anatomy, because SPECT looks at how the brainfunctions. Our SPECT work, now over 70,000 scans, has taught us so manyimportant life lessons about the brain, such as: * Brain injuries can ruin people’s lives; * Alcohol is not a health food and often shows significant damage on SPECT scans; * A number of the medications people routinely take, such as some common anti-anxiety medications, are not good for the brain; and * Diseases like Alzheimer’s actually start in the brain decades before people have any symptoms.SPECT scans have also taught us that as a society, we need to have much morelove and respect for the brain, and that allowing children to play contactsports, like football and hockey, is not a smart idea.One of the most exciting lessons I have learned is that people can literallychange their brains and change their lives by engaging in regular brain-healthyhabits, such as correcting negative beliefs and using meditative processes suchas those discussed by Dr. Dispenza.In one series of studies we published, the practice of meditation, such as whatDr. Dispenza recommends, boosted blood flow to the prefrontal cortex, the mostthoughtful part of the human brain. After eight weeks of daily meditation, theprefrontal cortex at rest was stronger, and the memories of our subjects werebetter, too. There are so many ways to heal and optimize the brain.My hope is that, like me, you will develop “brain envy” and want abetter-functioning brain. The brain-imaging work we do has changed everything inmy own life. Shortly after I started ordering SPECT scans in 1991, I decided tolook at my own brain. I was 37 years old. When I saw the toxic, bumpyappearance, I knew it was not healthy. All of my life I have been someone whorarely drank alcohol, never smoked, and never used an illegal drug. Then why didmy brain look so bad? Before I really understood about brain health, I’d hadmany bad brain habits. I ate lots of fast food, drank diet soda like she was mybest friend, often slept only four to five hours at night, and carriedunexamined hurts from the past. I didn’t exercise, felt chronically stressed,and carried an extra 30 pounds. What I didn’t know was hurting me … and not justa little.My last scan looks healthier and much younger than it did 20 years earlier. Mybrain has literally aged backward—that’s how changeable your brain is, too, whenyou make up your mind to take care of it properly. After seeing my originalscan, I wanted my brain to be better. This book will help yours be better, too.I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.— Daniel G. Amen, M.D.,author of Change Your Brain, Change Your Lifeimg [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]INTRODUCTION [toc.html#itr]image [images/line.jpg]The Greatest Habit You Can Ever Break Isthe Habit of Being Yourself [toc.html#itr]When I think about all the books on creating the life we desire, I realize thatmany of us are still looking for approaches that are grounded in soundscientific evidence—methods that truly work. But already new research into thebrain and body, the mind, and consciousness—and a quantum leap in ourunderstanding of physics—is suggesting expanded possibilities on how to movetoward what we innately know is our real potential.As a practicing chiropractor who runs a busy integrated-health clinic and as aneducator in the fields of neuroscience, brain function, biology, and brainchemistry, I have been privileged to be at the forefront of some of thisresearch—not just by studying the fields mentioned above, but also by observingthe effects of this new science, once applied by common people like you and me.That’s the moment when the possibilities of this new science become reality.As a consequence, I have witnessed some remarkable changes in individuals’health and quality of life when they truly change their minds. Over the lastseveral years, I have had the opportunity to interview a host of people whoovercame significant health conditions that were considered either terminal orpermanent. Per the contemporary model of medicine, these recoveries were labeled“spontaneous remissions.”However, upon my extensive examination of their inner journeys, it becameapparent to me that there was a strong element of mind involved … and theirphysical changes weren’t so spontaneous after all. This discovery furthered mypostgraduate studies in brain imaging, neuroplasticity, epigenetics, andpsychoneuroimmunology. I simply figured that something had to be happening inthe brain and body that could be zeroed in on and then replicated. In this book,I want to share some of what I learned along the way and show you, by exploringhow mind and matter are interrelated, how you can apply these principles notonly to your body, but to any aspect of your life.Go Beyond Knowing … to Knowing HowMany readers of my first book, Evolve Your Brain: The Science of Changing YourMind, voiced the same honest and heartfelt request (along with a fair amount ofpositive feedback), such as the person who wrote: “I really liked your book; Iread it twice. It had lots of science and was very thorough and inspiring, butcan you tell me how to do it? How do I evolve my brain?”In response, I began teaching a workshop series on the practical steps anyonecan take to make changes at the level of mind and body that will lead to lastingresults. Consequently, I have seen people experience unexplainable healings,release old mental and emotional wounds, resolve so-called impossibledifficulties, create new opportunities, and experience wonderful wealth, just toname a few. (You will meet some of those people in these pages.)It’s not necessary that you read my first book to digest the material in thisone. But if you have been exposed to my work, I wrote Breaking the Habit ofBeing Yourself to serve as a practical, how-to companion to Evolve Your Brain.It is my earnest objective to make this new book simple and easy to understand.There will be times, though, that I will have to give you bits of knowledge toact as the forerunner to a concept I want to develop. The purpose is to build arealistic working model of personal transformation that will help you understandhow we can change.Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself is a product of one of my passions—asincere effort to demystify the mystical so that every person understands thatwe have, within our reach, all we need to make significant changes in our lives.This is a time when not only do we want to “know,” but we want to “know how.”How do we apply and personalize both emerging scientific concepts and age-oldwisdom to succeed at living a more enriched life? When you and I can connect thedots of what science is discovering about the nature of reality, and when wegive ourselves permission to apply those principles in our day-to-day existence,then each of us becomes both a mystic and a scientist in our own life.So I invite you to experiment with everything that you learn in this book, andto objectively observe the results. What I mean is that if you make the effortto change your inner world of thoughts and feelings, your external environmentshould begin to give you feedback to show you that your mind has had an effecton your “outer” world. Why else would you do it?If you take intellectual information that you learn as a philosophy, and theninitiate that knowledge into your life by applying it enough times until youmaster it, you will ultimately move from being a philosopher to an initiate to amaster. Stay tuned … there is sound scientific evidence that this is possible.I do ask you up front to keep an open mind so that we can build, step-by-step,the concepts I outline in this book. All of this information is for you to dosomething with—otherwise it’s just good dinner conversation, isn’t it? Once youcan open your mind to the way things really are, and let go of your conditionedbeliefs with which you are accustomed to framing reality, you should see thefruits of your efforts. That is my wish for you.The information in these pages is there to inspire you to prove to yourself thatyou are a divine creator.We should never wait for science to give us permission to do the uncommon; if wedo, then we are turning science into another religion. We should be brave enoughto contemplate our lives, do what we thought was “outside the box,” and do itrepeatedly. When we do that, we are on our way to a greater level of personalpower.True empowerment comes when we start to look deeply at our beliefs. We may findtheir roots in the conditioning of religion, culture, society, education,family, the media, and even our genes (the latter being imprinted by the sensoryexperiences of our current lives, as well as untold generations). Then we weighthose old ideas against some new paradigms that may serve us better.Times are changing. As individuals awaken to a greater reality, we are part of amuch larger sea change. Our current systems and models of reality are breakingdown, and it is time for something new to emerge. Across the board, our modelsfor politics, economics, religion, science, education, medicine, and ourrelationship with the environment are all showing a different landscape thanjust ten years ago.Letting go of the outmoded and embracing the new sounds easy. But as I pointedout in Evolve Your Brain, much of what we have learned and experienced has beenincorporated into our biological “self,” and we wear it like a garment. But wealso know that what is true today might not be true tomorrow. Just as we havecome to question our perception of atoms as solid pieces of matter, reality andour interaction with it is a progression of ideas and beliefs.We also know that to leave the familiar life that we have grown accustomed toand waltz into something new is like a salmon swimming upstream: it takeseffort—and, frankly, it’s uncomfortable. And to top it off, ridicule,marginalization, opposition, and denigration from those who cling to what theythink they know greet us along the way.Who, with such an unconventional bent, is willing to meet such adversity in thename of some concept they cannot embrace with their senses, yet which is alivein their minds? How many times in history have individuals who were consideredheretics and fools, and thus took the abuse of the unexceptional, emerged asgeniuses, saints, or masters?Will you dare to be an original?Change as a Choice, Instead of a ReactionIt seems that human nature is such that we balk at changing until things getreally bad and we’re so uncomfortable that we can no longer go on with businessas usual. This is as true for an individual as it is for a society. We wait forcrisis, trauma, loss, disease, and tragedy before we get down to looking at whowe are, what we are doing, how we are living, what we are feeling, and what webelieve or know, in order to embrace true change. Often it takes a worst-casescenario for us to begin making changes that support our health, relationships,career, family, and future. My message is: Why wait?We can learn and change in a state of pain and suffering, or we can evolve in astate of joy and inspiration. Most embrace the former. To go with the latter, wejust have to make up our minds that change will probably entail a bit ofdiscomfort, some inconvenience, a break from a predictable routine, and a periodof not knowing.Most of us are already familiar with the temporary discomfort of not knowing. Westumbled through our early efforts to read until this skill became secondnature. When we first practiced the violin or the drums, our parents wished theycould send us to a soundproofed room. Pity the hapless patient who has his blooddrawn by a medical student who has the requisite knowledge but still lacks thefinesse that she will only gain through practice.Absorbing knowledge (knowing) and then gaining practical experience by applyingwhat you learned until a particular skill became ingrained in you (knowing how)is probably how you acquired most of the abilities that now feel like a part ofyour being (knowingness). In much the same way, learning how to change your lifeinvolves knowledge and the application of that knowledge. That is why this bookis divided into three overarching sections.Throughout Parts I and II, I will build ideas in sequence, forming a bigger andbroader model of understanding for you to personalize. If some ideas seemrepetitive, they are there to “re-mind” you about something that I don’t wantyou to forget. Repetition reinforces the circuits in your brain and forms moreneural connections so that in your weakest hour, you don’t talk yourself out ofgreatness. When you ease into Part III of the book with a sound knowledge base,you can experience for yourself the “truth” of what you learned earlier.Part I: The Science of YouOur exploration will start with an overview of philosophical and scientificparadigms related to the latest research about the nature of reality, who youare, why change has been so difficult for so many, and what is possible for youas a human being. Part I will be an easy read, I promise.— Chapter 1: The Quantum You introduces you to a bit of quantum physics, butdon’t be alarmed. I start there because it is important that you begin toembrace the concept that your (subjective) mind has an effect on your(objective) world. The observer effect in quantum physics states that where youdirect your attention is where you place your energy. As a consequence, youaffect the material world (which, by the way, is made mostly of energy). If youentertain that idea even for a moment, you might start focusing on what you wantinstead of what you don’t want. And you might even find yourself thinking: If anatom is 99.99999 percent energy and .00001 percent physical substance,1[endnotes.html#itra] then I’m actually more nothing than something! So why do Ikeep my attention on that small percentage of the physical world when I am somuch more? Is defining my present reality by what I perceive with my senses thebiggest limitation I have?In Chapters 2 through 4, we will look at what it means to change—to becomegreater than the environment, the body, and time.— You’ve probably entertained the idea that your thoughts create your life. Butin Chapter 2: Overcoming the Environment, I discuss how if you allow the outerworld to control how you think and feel, your external environment is patterningcircuits in your brain to make you think “equal to” everything familiar to you.The result is that you create more of the same; you hardwire your brain toreflect the problems, personal conditions, and circumstances in your life. So tochange, you must be greater than all things physical in your life.— Chapter 3: Overcoming the Body continues to look at how we unconsciously liveby a set of memorized behaviors, thoughts, and emotional reactions, all runninglike computer programs behind the scenes of our conscious awareness. That’s whyit is not enough to “think positive,” because most of who we are might residesubconsciously as negativity in the body. By the end of this book, you will knowhow to enter into the operating system of the subconscious mind and makepermanent changes where those programs exist.— Chapter 4: Overcoming Time examines how we either live in the anticipation offuture events or repeatedly revisit past memories (or both) until the bodybegins to believe it is living in a time other than the present moment. Thelatest research supports the notion that we have a natural ability to change thebrain and body by thought alone, so that it looks biologically like some futureevent has already happened. Because you can make thought more real than anythingelse, you can change who you are from brain cell to gene, given the rightunderstanding. When you learn how to use your attention and access the present,you will enter through the door to the quantum field, where all potentialsexist.— Chapter 5: Survival vs. Creation illustrates the distinction between living insurvival and living in creation. Living in survival entails living in stress andfunctioning as a materialist, believing that the outer world is more real thanthe inner world. When you are under the gun of the fight-or-flight nervoussystem, being run by its cocktail of intoxicating chemicals, you are programmedto be concerned only about your body, the things or people in your environment,and your obsession with time. Your brain and body are out of balance. You areliving a predictable life. However, when you are truly in the elegant state ofcreation, you are no body, no thing, no time—you forget about yourself. Youbecome pure consciousness, free from the chains of the identity that needs theouter reality to remember who it thinks it is.Part II: Your Brain and Meditation— In Chapter 6: Three Brains: Thinking to Doing to Being, you will embrace theconcept that you have three “brains” that allow you to move from thinking todoing to being. Even better, when you focus your attention to the exclusion ofyour environment, your body, and time, you can easily move from thinking tobeing without having to do anything. In that state of mind, your brain does notdistinguish between what is happening in the outer world of reality and what ishappening in the inner world of your mind. Thus, if you can mentally rehearse adesired experience via thought alone, you will experience the emotions of thatevent before it has physically manifested. Now you are moving into a new stateof being, because your mind and body are working as one. When you begin to feellike some potential future reality is happening to you in the moment that youare focusing on it, you are rewriting your automatic habits, attitudes, andother unwanted subconscious programs.— Chapter 7: The Gap explores how to break free from the emotions that you’vememorized—which have become your personality—and how to close the gap betweenwho you really are in your inner, private world and how you appear in the outer,social world. We all reach a certain point when we stop learning and realizethat nothing external can take away those feelings from our past. If you canpredict the feeling of every experience in your life, there is no room foranything new to occur, because you are viewing your life from the past insteadof the future. This is the juncture point where the soul either breaks free orfalls into oblivion. You will learn to liberate your energy in the form ofemotions, and thus narrow the gap between how you appear and who you are.Ultimately, you will create transparency. When how you appear is who you are,you are truly free.— Part II concludes with Chapter 8: Meditation, Demystifying the Mystical, andWaves of Your Future, in which my purpose is to demystify meditation so that youknow what you are doing and why. Discussing brain-wave technology, made simple,I show you how your brain changes electromagnetically when you are focusedversus when you are in an aroused state due to stressors in your life. You willlearn that the true purpose of meditation is to get beyond the analytical mindand enter into the subconscious mind so you can make real and permanent changes.If you get up from meditation as the same person who sat down, nothing hashappened to you on any level. When you meditate and connect to somethinggreater, you can create and then memorize such coherence between your thoughtsand feelings that nothing in your outer reality—no thing, no person, nocondition at any place or time—could move you from that level of energy. Now youare mastering your environment, your body, and time.Part III: Stepping Toward Your New DestinyAll of the information in Parts I and II is provided in order to equip you withthe necessary knowledge so that when you demonstrate (apply) this information inPart III, which supplies the “how-to,” you will have a direct experience of whatyou’ve been taught. Part III is all about applying yourself in an actualdiscipline—a mindful exercise to use in your daily life. It’s a step-by-stepmeditation process, created so you can actually do something with the theoriesgiven to you.By the way, did your mind balk when I mentioned that multistep process? If so,it’s not what you think. Yes, you will learn a sequence of actions, but soon youwill experience them as one or two simple steps. After all, you probably performmultiple actions every time you prepare to drive your car (for example, youadjust the seat, put on your seat belt, check the mirrors, start the car, turnon the headlights, look around, use a turn signal, apply the brake, put the carin drive or reverse, apply pressure to the gas pedal, and so on). Ever since youlearned to drive, you have executed this procedure easily and automatically. Iassure you, the same will be true once you learn each step in Part III.You may be asking yourself, Why do I need to read Parts I and II? I’ll just jumpto Part III. I know, I’d probably be thinking the same. I decided to offer therelevant knowledge in the first two Parts of the text so that when you get tothe third section, nothing will be left to conjecture, dogma, or speculation.When you begin the steps of the meditation, you’ll know exactly what you’redoing and why. When you comprehend the what and the why, the more you will knowand thus the more you will know how when the time comes. Therefore, you willhave more power and intention behind the practical experience of truly changingyour mind.By using the steps in Part III, you may be more prone to accept your innateability to change so-called impossible situations in your life. You might evengive yourself permission to entertain potential realities that you neverconsidered prior to your exposure to these new concepts—you might just begin todo the uncommon! That is my aim for you by the time you finish this book.So if you can resist the temptation to jump ahead to Part III, I promise thatwhen you get there, you’ll be quite empowered by what you learn. I’ve seen thisapproach work throughout the world in the series of three workshops I lead. Whenpeople gain the right knowledge, in such a way that they understand itcompletely, and then have the opportunity for effective instruction to applywhat they comprehend … then like magic, they can see the fruits of their effortsin the form of changes that serve as feedback in their lives.Part III will give you the meditative skills to change something within yourmind and body and to produce an effect outside of you. Once you can notice whatyou did inside of you that produced an outcome outside of you, you’ll do itagain. When a new experience manifests in your life, you’ll embrace the energyyou feel in the form of an elevated emotion such as empowerment, awe, or immensegratitude; and that energy will drive you to do it again and again. Now you areon the path to true evolution.Each meditation step delineated in Part III is associated with a piece ofmeaningful information presented earlier in the book. Because you’ll havecultivated the meaning behind exactly what you’re doing, there should be noambiguity that might cause you to lose your vision.Like many skills you’ve learned, in the beginning it may take all of yourconscious effort to stay focused as you learn how to meditate to evolve yourbrain. In the process, you must restrain yourself from your typical behaviorsand maintain your thoughts on what you are doing, without wandering toextraneous stimuli, so your actions are aligned with your intention.Just as you might have experienced when you first learned to cook Thai food,play golf, dance the salsa, or drive a stick shift, the newness of the endeavorwill require you to practice this ability continually, training both mind andbody to memorize each step.Remember, most types of instruction are formatted in bite-size chunks so thatthe mind and body can begin to work together. Once you “get it,” all theindividual steps you kept reviewing merge into one smooth process. Themethodical, linear approach seamlessly flows into a holistic, effortless,unified demonstration. This is the point of personal ownership. At times, theeffort this takes can be tedious. But if you persist with a certain amount ofwill and energy, in time you’ll enjoy the results.When you know that you know “how” to do something, you’re on your way tomastering it. I am overjoyed to say that many people around the world arealready using the knowledge in this book to make demonstrable changes in theirlives. It is my sincere passion that you, too, break the habit of being yourselfand create the new life you desire.Let’s get started….img [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]PART I [toc.html#pt01]image [images/logo2.jpg]THESCIENCEOF YOU [toc.html#pt01]image [images/logo2.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER ONE [toc.html#ch01]image [images/line.jpg]THE QUANTUM YOU [toc.html#ch01]Early physicists divided the world into matter and thought, and later, matterand energy. Each member of those pairs was considered to be entirely separatefrom the other … but they’re not! Nevertheless, this mind/matter duality shapedour early worldview—that reality was essentially predetermined and that peoplecould do little to change things through their own actions, let alone theirthoughts.Fast-forward to our current understanding—that we are part of a vast, invisiblefield of energy, which contains all possible realities and responds to ourthoughts and our feelings. Just as today’s scientists are exploring therelationship between thought and matter, we are eager to do the same in our ownlives. And so we ask ourselves, Can I use my mind to create my reality? If so,is that a skill that we can learn and use to become who we want to be, andcreate the life we want to experience?Let’s face it—none of us is perfect. Whether we’d like to make some change toour physical self, emotional self, or spiritual self, we all have the samedesire: we want to live life as an idealized version of who we think and believewe can be. When we stand in front of the mirror and look at our love handles, wedon’t just see that slightly too-pudgy vision reflected in the glass. We alsosee, depending on our mood that day, a slimmer, fitter version of ourselves or aheavier, chunkier version. Which of our images is real?When we lie in bed at night reviewing our day and our efforts to be a moretolerant, less reactive person, we don’t just see the parent who lashed out atour child for failing to quietly and quickly submit to a simple request. Weenvision either an angelic self whose patience was stretched like an innocentvictim on the rack or a hideous ogre laying waste to a child’s self-esteem.Which of those images is real?The answer is: all of them are real—and not just those extremes, but an infinitespectrum of images ranging from positive to negative. How can that be? For youto better understand why none of those versions of self is more or less realthan the others, I’m going to have to shatter the outmoded understanding aboutthe fundamental nature of reality and replace it with a new one.That sounds like a major undertaking, and in some ways it is, but I also knowthis: The most likely reason why you were drawn to this book is that your pastefforts to make any lasting change in your life—physical, emotional, orspiritual—have fallen short of the ideal of yourself that you imagined. And whythose efforts failed has more to do with your beliefs about why your life is theway it is than with anything else, including a perceived lack of will, time,courage, or imagination.Always, in order to change, we have to come to a new understanding of self andthe world so that we can embrace new knowledge and have new experiences.That is what reading this book will do for you.Your past shortfalls can be traced, at their root, to one major oversight: youhaven’t committed yourself to living by the truth that your thoughts haveconsequences so great that they create your reality.The fact is that we are all blessed; we all can reap the benefits of ourconstructive efforts. We don’t have to settle for our present reality; we cancreate a new one, whenever we choose to. We all have that ability, because forbetter or worse, our thoughts do influence our lives.I’m sure you’ve heard that before, but I wonder whether most people reallybelieve this statement on a gut level. If we truly embraced the notion that ourthoughts produce tangible effects in our lives, wouldn’t we strive to never letone thought slip by us that we didn’t want to experience? And wouldn’t we focusour attention on what we want, instead of continually obsessing about ourproblems?Think about it: if you really knew that this principle were true, would you evermiss a day in intentionally creating your desired destiny?To Change Your Life, Change YourBeliefs about the Nature of RealityI hope this book will shift your view of how our world operates, convince youthat you are more powerful than you knew, and inspire you to demonstrate theunderstanding that what you think and believe has a profound effect on yourworld.Until you break from the way you see your present reality, any change in yourlife will always be haphazard and transitory. You have to overhaul your thinkingabout why things happen in order to produce enduring and desired outcomes. To dothat, you’ll need to be open to a new interpretation of what is real and true.To help you shift into this mode of thought and begin to create a life of yourchoosing, I have to begin with a bit of cosmology (the study of the structureand dynamics of the universe). But don’t be alarmed—we’re merely going to skimthrough “The Nature of Reality 101” and how some of our views about it haveevolved to reach our present understanding. All of this is to explain (ofnecessity, in a brief and simple way) how it is possible that your thoughtsshape your destiny.This chapter just might test your willingness to abandon ideas that have in asense been programmed into you for many years on a conscious and subconsciouslevel. Once you gain a new conception of the fundamental forces and elementsthat constitute reality, it won’t fit into that old perception in which thelinear and the orderly rule the day. Be prepared to experience some fundamentalshifts in understanding.In fact, as you begin to embrace this new outlook, your very makeup as a humanbeing will change. It is my wish that you will no longer be the same person youwere when you began.Obviously, I’m about to challenge you, but I want you to know that I’m entirelyempathetic, because I too have had to let go of what I thought was true and leapinto the unknown. To ease into this new way of thinking about the nature of ourworld, let’s see how our worldview was shaped by the early belief that mind andmatter were separate things.Always Matter, Never Mind?Always Mind, Never Matter?Connecting the dots between the outer, physical world of the observable and theinner, mental world of thought has always presented quite a challenge toscientists and philosophers. To many of us, even today, the mind appears to havelittle or no measurable effects on the world of matter. Although we’d probablyagree that the world of matter creates consequences affecting our minds, how canour minds possibly produce any physical changes affecting the solid things inour lives? Mind and matter appear to be separate … that is, unless there’s ashift in our understanding about the way physical, solid things actually exist.Well, there has been such a shift, and to trace its beginnings, we don’t have togo back very far. For much of what historians consider modern times, humanitybelieved that the nature of the universe was orderly, and thus predictable andexplainable. Consider 17th-century mathematician and philosopher René Descartes,who developed many concepts that still have great relevance to mathematics andother fields (does I think, therefore I am ring any bells?). In retrospect,however, one of his theories ultimately did more harm than good. Descartes was aproponent of the mechanistic model of the universe—a view that the universe iscontrolled by predictable laws.When it came to human thought, Descartes faced a real challenge—the human mindpossessed too many variables to neatly fit into any laws. Since he couldn’tunify his understanding of the physical world with that of the mind, but he hadto account for the presence of both, Descartes played a nifty mind game (punintended). He said that the mind was not subject to laws of the objective,physical world, so it was completely outside the bounds of scientific inquiry.The study of matter was the jurisdiction of science (always matter, nevermind)—whereas the mind was God’s instrument, so the study of it fell to religion(always mind, never matter).Essentially, Descartes started a belief system that imposed a duality betweenthe concepts of mind and matter. For centuries, that division stood as theaccepted understanding of the nature of reality.Helping to perpetuate Descartes’s beliefs were the experiments and theories ofSir Isaac Newton. The English mathematician and scientist not only solidifiedthe concept of the universe as a machine, but he produced a set of laws statingthat human beings could precisely determine, calculate, and predict the orderlyways in which the physical world would operate.According to the “classical” Newtonian physics model, all things were consideredsolid. For example, energy could be explained as a force to move objects or tochange the physical state of matter. But as you will see, energy is much morethan an outside force exerted on material things. Energy is the very fabric ofall things material, and is responsive to mind.By extension, the work of Descartes and Newton established a mind-set that ifreality operated on mechanistic principles, then humanity had little influenceon outcomes. All of reality was predetermined. Given that outlook, is it anywonder that human beings struggled with the idea that their actions mattered,let alone entertained the notion that their thoughts mattered or that free willplayed any part in the grand scheme of things? Don’t many of us still labortoday (subconsciously or consciously) under the assumption that we humans areoften little more than victims?Considering that these cherished beliefs held sway for centuries, it took somerevolutionary thought to counter Descartes and Newton.Einstein: Not Just Rocking the Boat—Rocking the UniverseAbout 200 years after Newton, Albert Einstein produced his famous equation E =mc2, demonstrating that energy and matter are so fundamentally related that theyare one and the same. Essentially, his work showed that matter and energy arecompletely interchangeable. This directly contradicted Newton and Descartes, andushered in a new understanding of how the universe functions.Einstein didn’t single-handedly crumble our previous view of the nature ofreality. But he did undermine its foundation, and that eventually led to thecollapse of some of our narrow, rigid ways of thinking. His theories set off anexploration of the puzzling behavior of light. Scientists then observed thatlight sometimes behaves like a wave (when it bends around a corner, forexample), and at other times, it behaves like a particle. How could light beboth a wave and a particle? According to the outlook of Descartes and Newton, itcouldn’t—a phenomenon had to be either one or the other.Quickly, it became clear that the dualistic Cartesian/Newtonian model was flawedat the most basic level of all: the subatomic. (Subatomic refers to theparts—electrons, protons, neutrons, and so on—that make up atoms, which are thebuilding blocks of all things physical.) The most fundamental components of ourso-called physical world are both waves (energy) and particles (physicalmatter), depending on the mind of the observer (we’ll come back to that). Tounderstand how the world works, we had to look to its tiniest components.Thus, out of these particular experiments, a new field of science was born,called quantum physics.The Solid Ground We Stand On … Isn’tThis change was a complete reimagining of the world we’d thought we lived in,and it led to the proverbial rug being pulled out from under our feet—feet weused to think were planted on solid ground. How so? Think back to those oldtoothpick-and-Styrofoam-ball models of the atom. Before quantum physics camealong, people believed that an atom was made of a relatively solid nucleus withsmaller, less substantial objects either located in or around it. The very ideathat with a powerful enough instrument we could measure (calculate the mass of)and count (number) the subatomic particles that made up an atom made them seemas inert as cows grazing in a pasture. Atoms seemed to be made of solid stuff,right?img [images/p09-01.jpg]Figure 1A. The “old-school” classical Newtonian version of an atom. The focus isprimarily on the material.Nothing could be further from the truth as revealed by the quantum model. Atomsare mostly empty space; atoms are energy. Think about this: everything physicalin your life is not solid matter—rather, it’s all fields of energy or frequencypatterns of information. All matter is more “no thing” (energy) than “something” (particles).img [images/p10-01.jpg]Figure 1B. The “new-school” quantum version of an atom with an electron cloud.The atom is 99.99999 percent energy and .00001 percent matter. It’s just aboutnothing, materially.img [images/p11-01.jpg]Figure 1C. This is the most realistic model of any atom. It is “no thing”materially, but all things potentially.Another Puzzle: Subatomic Particles andLarger Objects Play by Different RulesBut this alone wasn’t enough to explain the nature of reality. Einstein andothers had another puzzle to solve—matter didn’t always seem to behave in thesame ways. When physicists began observing and measuring the tiny world of theatom, they noticed that at the subatomic level the fundamental elements of theatom didn’t obey the laws of classical physics the way that larger objects did.Events involving objects in the “large” world were predictable, reproducible,and consistent. When that legendary apple fell from a tree and moved toward thecenter of the earth until it collided with Newton’s head, its mass acceleratedwith a consistent force. But electrons, as particles, behaved in unpredictable,unusual ways. When they interacted with the nucleus of the atom and moved towardits center, they gained and lost energy, appeared and disappeared, and seemed toshow up all over the place without regard to the boundaries of time and space.Did the world of the small and the world of the large operate under verydifferent sets of rules? Since subatomic particles like electrons were thebuilding blocks of everything in nature, how could they be subject to one set ofrules, and the things they made up behave according to another set of rules?From Matter to Energy:Particles Pull Off the Ultimate Vanishing ActAt the level of electrons, scientists can measure energy-dependentcharacteristics such as wavelength, voltage potentials, and the like, but theseparticles have a mass that is so infinitesimally small and exists so temporarilyas to be almost nonexistent.This is what makes the subatomic world unique. It possesses not just physicalqualities, but also energetic qualities. In truth, matter on a subatomic levelexists as a momentary phenomenon. It’s so elusive that it constantly appears anddisappears, appearing into three dimensions and disappearing into nothing—intothe quantum field, in no space, no time—transforming from particle (matter) towave (energy), and vice versa. But where do particles go when they vanish intothin air?img [images/p13-01.jpg]Figure 1D. The electron exists as a wave of probability in one moment, and thenin the next moment appears as a solid particle, then disappears into nothing,and then reappears at another location.The Creation of Reality:Energy Responds to Mindful AttentionConsider again that old-school toothpick-and-Styrofoam-ball model of how atomswere constructed. Back then, weren’t we led to believe that electrons orbitedabout the nucleus like planets around the sun? If so, we could pinpoint theirlocation, couldn’t we? The answer is yes, in a manner of speaking, but thereason is not at all what we used to think.What quantum physicists discovered was that the person observing (or measuring)the tiny particles that make up atoms affects the behavior of energy and matter.Quantum experiments demonstrated that electrons exist simultaneously in aninfinite array of possibilities or probabilities in an invisible field ofenergy. But only when an observer focuses attention on any location of any oneelectron does that electron appear. In other words, a particle cannot manifestin reality—that is, ordinary space-time as we know it—until we observe it.1[endnotes.html#ch01_en1]Quantum physics calls this phenomenon “collapse of the wave function” or the“observer effect.” We now know that the moment the observer looks for anelectron, there is a specific point in time and space when all probabilities ofthe electron collapse into a physical event. With this discovery, mind andmatter can no longer be considered separate; they are intrinsically related,because subjective mind produces measurable changes on the objective, physicalworld.Are you beginning to see why this chapter is titled “The Quantum You”? At thesubatomic level, energy responds to your mindful attention and becomes matter.How would your life change if you learned to direct the observer effect and tocollapse infinite waves of probability into the reality that you choose? Couldyou get better at observing the life you want?An Infinite Number of Possible RealitiesAwait the ObserverSo ponder this: Everything in the physical universe is made up of subatomicparticles such as electrons. By their very nature, these particles, when theyexist as pure potential, are in their wave state while they are not beingobserved. They are potentially “every thing” and “no thing” until they areobserved. They exist everywhere and nowhere until they are observed. Thus,everything in our physical reality exists as pure potential.If subatomic particles can exist in an infinite number of possible placessimultaneously, we are potentially capable of collapsing into existence aninfinite number of possible realities. In other words, if you can imagine afuture event in your life based on any one of your personal desires, thatreality already exists as a possibility in the quantum field, waiting to beobserved by you. If your mind can influence the appearance of an electron, thentheoretically it can influence the appearance of any possibility.This means that the quantum field contains a reality in which you are healthy,wealthy, and happy, and possess all of the qualities and capabilities of theidealized self that you hold in your thoughts. Stay with me and you will seethat with willful attention, sincere application of new knowledge, and repeateddaily efforts, you can use your mind, as the observer, to collapse quantumparticles and organize a vast number of subatomic waves of probability into adesired physical event called an experience in your life.Like clay, the energy of infinite possibilities is shaped by consciousness: yourmind. And if all matter is made of energy, it makes sense that consciousness(“mind,” in this case, as Newton and Descartes called it) and energy (“matter,”according to the quantum model) are so intimately related that they are one.Mind and matter are completely entangled. Your consciousness (mind) has effectson energy (matter) because your consciousness is energy and energy hasconsciousness. You are powerful enough to influence matter because at the mostelementary level, you are energy with a consciousness. You are mindful matter.In the quantum model, the physical universe is an immaterial, interconnected,unified field of information, potentially every thing but physically no thing.The quantum universe is just waiting for a conscious observer (you or me) tocome along and influence energy in the form of potential matter by using themind and consciousness (which are themselves energy) to make waves of energeticprobabilities coalesce into physical matter. Just as the wave of possibility ofthe electron manifests as a particle within a specific momentary event, weobservers cause a particle or groups of particles to manifest physicalexperiences in the form of events in our lives.This is crucial to understanding how you can cause an effect or make a change inyour life. When you learn how to sharpen your skills of observation tointentionally affect your destiny, you are well on your way toward living theideal version of your life by becoming the idealized version of your self.We Are Connected to Everything in the Quantum FieldLike everything else in the universe, we are, in a sense, connected to a sea ofinformation in a dimension beyond physical space and time. We don’t need to betouching or even in close proximity to any physical elements in the quantumfield to affect or be affected by them. The physical body is organized patternsof energy and information, which is unified with everything in the quantumfield.You, like all of us, broadcast a distinct energy pattern or signature. In fact,everything material is always emitting specific patterns of energy. And thisenergy carries information. Your fluctuating states of mind consciously orunconsciously change that signature on a moment-to-moment basis because you aremore than just a physical body; you are a consciousness using a body and a brainto express different levels of mind.Another way to look at how we humans and the quantum field are interconnected isthrough the concept of quantum entanglement, or quantum nonlocal connection.Essentially, once two particles can be initially linked in some way, they willalways be bonded together beyond space and time. As a result, anything that isdone to one will be done to the other even though they are spatially separatedfrom one another. This means that since we too are made up of particles, we areall implicitly connected beyond space and time. What we do unto others, we dounto ourselves.Think about the implications of this. If you can wrap your mind around thisconcept, then you’d have to agree that the “you” that exists in a probablefuture is already connected to the “you” in this now, in a dimension beyond thistime and space. Stay tuned … by the end of this book, that idea just might seemnormal to you!Weird Science: Can We Affect the Past?Since we’re all interconnected across distance and time, does this suggest thatour thoughts and feelings can influence events in our past as well as those wedesire in our future?In July 2000, Israeli doctor Leonard Leibovici conducted a double-blind,randomized controlled trial involving 3,393 hospital patients, divided into acontrol group and an “intercession” group. He set out to see whether prayercould have an effect on their condition.2 [endnotes.html#ch01_en2] Prayerexperiments are great examples of mind affecting matter at a distance. But staywith me here, because everything is not always what it seems.Leibovici selected patients who had suffered sepsis (an infection) whilehospitalized. He randomly designated half the patients to have prayers said forthem, while the other half were not prayed for. He compared the results in threecategories: how long fever lasted, length of hospital stay, and how many died asa result of the infection.The prayed-for benefited from an earlier decrease in fever and a shorterhospitalization time; the difference in the number of deaths among theprayed-for and not-prayed-for groups was not statistically significant, althoughbetter in the prayed-for group.That’s a powerful demonstration of the benefits of prayer and how we can send anintention out into the quantum field through our thoughts and feelings. However,there’s one additional element to this story that you should know about. Did itstrike you as slightly odd that in July 2000, a hospital would have more than3,000 cases of infection at once? Was it a very poorly sterilized place, or wassome kind of contagion running rampant?Actually, those who were praying weren’t praying for patients who were infectedin 2000. Instead, unbeknownst to them, they were praying for lists of people whohad been in the hospital from 1990 to 1996—four to ten years prior to theexperiment! The prayed-for patients actually got better during the 1990s fromthe experiment conducted years later. Let me say this another way: the patientswho were prayed for in 2000 all showed measurable changes in health, but thosechanges took effect years before.A statistical analysis of this experiment proved that these effects were farbeyond coincidence. This demonstrates that our intentions, our thoughts andfeelings, and our prayers not only affect our present or future, but they canactually affect our past as well.Now, this leads to the question: if you were to pray (or focus on an intention)for a better life for yourself, could it affect your past, present, and future?The quantum law says that all potentials exist simultaneously. Our thinking andour feelings affect all aspects of life, beyond both space and time.Our State of Being or State of Mind:When Mind and Body Are OnePlease note: Throughout this book, I will refer interchangeably to your havingand creating a state of being or a state of mind. For example, we could say thathow you think and how you feel create a state of being. I want you to understandthat when I use the terms state of being and state of mind, your physical bodyis a part of that state. In fact, as you will see later on, many people exist ina state in which the body has “become” the mind, when they are ruled almostexclusively by the body and how it feels. So when I talk about the observerhaving an effect, it is not just the brain that is at work influencing matter,but the body as well. It is your state of being (when mind and body are one), asan observer, which has effects on the external world.Thoughts + Feelings Produce Test-Tube ResultsWe communicate with the quantum field primarily through our thoughts andfeelings. Since our thoughts are themselves energy—as you know, the electricalimpulses the brain generates can easily be measured by devices such as anEEG—they are one of the primary means by which we send out signals into thefield.Before I go into greater detail on how this works, I want to share with you aremarkable study that demonstrates how our thoughts and feelings influencematter.Cellular biologist Glen Rein, Ph.D., conceived of a series of experiments totest healers’ ability to affect biological systems. Since DNA is more stablethan substances such as cells or bacterial cultures, he decided to have healershold test tubes containing DNA.3 [endnotes.html#ch01_en3]This study took place at the HeartMath Research Center in California. The folksthere have conducted extraordinary research into the physiology of emotions,heart-brain interactions, and much more. Essentially, they and others havedocumented a specific link between our emotional states and our heart rhythms.When we have negative emotions (such as anger and fear), our heart rhythmsbecome erratic and disorganized. In contrast, positive emotions (love and joy,for instance) produce highly ordered, coherent patterns that HeartMathresearchers refer to as heart coherence.In Dr. Rein’s experiment, he first studied a group of ten individuals who werewell practiced in using techniques that HeartMath teaches to build heart-focusedcoherence. They applied the techniques to produce strong, elevated feelings suchas love and appreciation, then for two minutes, they held vials containing DNAsamples suspended in deionized water. When those samples were analyzed, nostatistically significant changes had occurred.A second group of trained participants did the same thing, but instead of justcreating positive emotions (a feeling) of love and appreciation, theysimultaneously held an intention (a thought) to either wind or unwind thestrands of DNA. This group produced statistically significant changes in theconformation (shape) of the DNA samples. In some cases the DNA was wound orunwound as much as 25 percent!A third group of trained subjects held a clear intent to change the DNA, butthey were instructed not to enter into a positive emotional state. In otherwords, they were only using thought (intention) to affect matter. The result? Nochanges to the DNA samples.The positive emotional state that the first group entered did nothing by itselfto the DNA. Another group’s clearly held intentional thought, unaccompanied byemotion, also had no impact. Only when subjects held both heightened emotionsand clear objectives in alignment were they able to produce the intended effect.An intentional thought needs an energizer, a catalyst—and that energy is anelevated emotion. Heart and mind working together. Feelings and thoughts unifiedinto a state of being. If a state of being can wind and unwind strands of DNA intwo minutes, what does this say about our ability to create reality?What the HeartMath experiment demonstrates is that the quantum field doesn’trespond simply to our wishes—our emotional requests. It doesn’t just respond toour aims—our thoughts. It only responds when those two are aligned orcoherent—that is, when they are broadcasting the same signal. When we combine anelevated emotion with an open heart and a conscious intention with clearthought, we signal the field to respond in amazing ways.The quantum field responds not to what we want; it responds to who we are being.Thoughts and Feelings: Broadcasting OurElectromagnetic Signal to the Quantum FieldSince every potential in the universe is a wave of probability that has anelectromagnetic field and is energetic in nature, it makes sense that ourthoughts and feelings are no exception.I find it a useful model to think of thoughts as the electrical charge in thequantum field and feelings as the magnetic charge in the field.4[endnotes.html#ch01_en4] The thoughts we think send an electrical signal outinto the field. The feelings we generate magnetically draw events back to us.Together, how we think and how we feel produces a state of being, whichgenerates an electromagnetic signature that influences every atom in our world.This should prompt us to ask, What am I broadcasting (consciously orunconsciously) on a daily basis?All potential experiences exist as electromagnetic signatures in the quantumfield. There are an infinite number of potential electromagnetic signatures—forgenius, for wealth, for freedom, for health—that already exist as a frequencypattern of energy. If you could create a new electromagnetic field by changingyour state of being, which matches that potential in the quantum field ofinformation, is it possible that your body would be drawn to that event or thatevent would find you?img [images/p21.jpg]Figure 1E. All potential experiences exist in the quantum field as a sea ofinfinite possibilities. When you change your electromagnetic signature to matchone that already exists in the field, your body will be drawn to that event, youwill move into a new line of time, or the event will find you in your newreality.To Experience Change,Observe a New Outcome with a New MindQuite simply, our routine, known thoughts and feelings perpetuate the same stateof being, which creates the same behaviors, and creates the same reality. So ifwe want to change some aspect of our reality, we have to think, feel, and act innew ways; we have to “be” different in terms of our responses to experiences. Wehave to “become” someone else. We have to create a new state of mind … we needto observe a new outcome with that new mind.From a quantum standpoint, we have to create a different state of being as anobserver and generate a new electromagnetic signature. When we do, we will matcha potential reality in the field that exists only as an electromagneticpotential. Once that match exists between who we are being/what we arebroadcasting and the electromagnetic potential in the field, we will be pulledtoward that potential reality, or it will find us.I know that it’s frustrating when life seems to produce an endless succession ofminor variations on the same negative outcomes. But as long as you stay the sameperson, as long as your electromagnetic signature remains the same, you can’texpect a new outcome. To change your life is to change your energy—to make anelemental change in your mind and emotions.If you want a new outcome, you will have to break the habit of being yourself,and reinvent a new self.Change Requires Coherence:Align Your Thoughts and FeelingsWhat do your state of being and a laser have in common? I’ll make thisconnection to illustrate another thing you need to know if you want to changeyour life.A laser is an example of a very coherent signal. When physicists talk about acoherent signal, they are referring to a signal made up of waves that are “inphase”—their troughs (low points) and crests (high points) are parallel. Whenthose waves are coherent, they are much more powerful.img [images/p23.jpg]Figure 1F. When waves are in phase and rhythmic, they are more powerful thanwhen they are out of phase.Waves in a signal are either aligned or unaligned, coherent or incoherent. Thesame goes for your thoughts and feelings. How many times have you tried tocreate something, thinking in your mind that the end result was possible butfeeling in your heart that it wasn’t? What was the result of thatincoherent/out-of-phase signal that you were sending? Why is it that nothingmanifested? As you just saw with the HeartMath study, quantum creating onlyworks when your thoughts and feelings are aligned.Just as the waves in a signal are much more powerful when they are coherent, thesame is true of you when your thoughts and your feelings are aligned. When youhold clear, focused thoughts about your purpose, accompanied by your passionateemotional engagement, you broadcast a stronger electromagnetic signal that pullsyou toward a potential reality that matches what you want.I frequently talk to my workshop audiences about my grandmother, a woman Iadored. She was old-school Italian, as steeped in Catholic guilt as she was inthe tradition of making tomato gravy to spoon on pasta. She prayed constantlyfor things and deliberately thought about a new life, but the guilt that hadbeen instilled in her throughout her upbringing confused the signal she wassending. She only manifested more reasons to feel guilty.If your intentions and desires haven’t produced consistent results, you’veprobably been sending an incoherent, mixed message into the field. You may wantwealth, you may think “wealthy” thoughts, but if you feel poor, you aren’t goingto attract financial abundance to yourself. Why not? Because thoughts are thelanguage of the brain, and feelings are the language of the body. You’rethinking one way and feeling another way. And when the mind is in opposition tothe body (or vice versa), the field won’t respond in any consistent way.Instead, when mind and body are working together, when our thoughts and feelingsare aligned, when we are in a new state of being, then we are sending a coherentsignal on the airwaves of the invisible.Why Quantum Outcomes Should Come as a SurpriseNow let’s fill in another piece of the puzzle. To change our reality, thoseoutcomes that we attract to ourselves have to surprise, even astonish, us in theway in which they come about. We should never be able to predict how our newcreations will manifest; they must catch us off guard. They have to wake us upfrom the dream of the routine reality that we’ve grown accustomed to. Thesemanifestations should leave us with no doubt that our consciousness made contactwith the quantum field of intelligence, so we are inspired to do this again.That is the joy of the creative process.Why should you want a quantum surprise? If you can predict an event, it isnothing new—it’s routine, automatic; and you have experienced it many timesbefore. If you can predict it, the same you produced the same familiar outcome.In fact, if you’re trying to control how an outcome will occur, you just went“Newtonian.” Newtonian (classical) physics was about trying to anticipate andpredict events; it was all about cause and effect.What does “going Newtonian” mean when applied to your ability to create? It’swhen the external environment is controlling your internal environment(thinking/feeling). That’s cause and effect.Instead, change your internal environment—the way you think and feel—and thensee how the external environment is altered by your efforts. Strive to create anunknown, new future experience. Then when an unforeseen event occurs in yourfavor, you will be pleasantly surprised. You just became a quantum creator. Youjust went from “cause and effect” to “causing an effect.”Hold a clear intention of what you want, but leave the “how” details to theunpredictable quantum field. Let it orchestrate an event in your life in a waythat is just right for you. If you’re going to expect anything, expect theunexpected. Surrender, trust, and let go of how a desired event will unfold.This is the biggest hurdle for most to overcome, because we human beings alwayswant to control a future reality by trying to re-create how it occurred in apast reality.Quantum Creating:Giving Thanks Before Receiving an OutcomeI’ve just talked about aligning our thoughts and feelings to produce the resultwe want … yet in the process, letting go of the details surrounding how thatevent will come about. That’s a leap of faith, and it is necessary if we are toexchange a life of humdrum, predictable outcomes for a joyful life of newexperiences and quantum surprises.But we’ll need to make yet another leap of faith to bring what we want intoreality.Under what circumstances are you typically grateful? You may answer, I’mgrateful for my family, the nice home I have, my friends, and my job. What thosethings have in common is that they’re already in your life.Generally, we are grateful for something that already happened or is alreadypresent in our lives. You and I have been conditioned into believing that weneed a reason for joy, a motivation to feel gratitude, grounds to be in a stateof love. That’s relying on external reality to make us feel differentinternally; it’s Newton’s model.The new model of reality challenges us, as quantum creators, to change somethingwithin us—in mind and body, in our thoughts and feelings—before we canexperience the physical evidence with our senses.Can you give thanks and feel the elevated emotions associated with a desiredevent before it occurs? Can you imagine that reality so completely that youbegin to be in that future life now?In terms of quantum creating, can you give thanks for something that exists as apotential in the quantum field but has not yet happened in your reality? If so,you are moving from cause and effect (waiting for something outside of you tomake a change inside of you) to causing an effect (changing something inside ofyou to produce an effect outside of you).When you are in a state of gratitude, you transmit a signal into the field thatan event has already occurred. Gratitude is more than an intellectual thoughtprocess. You have to feel as though whatever you want is in your reality at thisvery moment. Thus, your body (which only understands feelings) must be convincedthat it has the emotional quotient of the future experience, happening to younow.Universal Intelligence and the Quantum FieldI hope by now you agree on some basic underlying concepts of the quantummodel—that all physical reality is primarily energy existing in a vast web thatis interconnected across space and time. That web, the quantum field, holds allprobabilities, which we can collapse into reality through our thoughts(consciousness), observation, feelings, and state of being.But is reality nothing but indifferent electromagnetic forces acting on and inresponse to one another? Is the animating spirit within us simply a function ofbiology and randomness? I’ve had conversations with people who hold this view.Ultimately the discussion leads to a dialogue that goes something like this:Where does the intelligence that keeps our heart beating come from?That’s a part of the autonomic nervous system.Where is that system located?The brain. The brain’s limbic system is part of the autonomic nervous system.And within the brain, are there specific tissues that are responsible forkeeping the heart beating?Yes.What are those tissues made up of?Cells.And what are those cells made up of?Molecules.What are those molecules made up of?Atoms.And what are those atoms made up of?Subatomic particles.And what are those subatomic particles primarily composed of?Energy.When we arrive at the conclusion that our physiological vehicle is made up ofthe same stuff as the rest of the universe, and these folks bump up against thenotion that what animates the body is a form of energy—the same 99.99999 percent“nothing” that constitutes the physical universe—they either shrug and walk awayor come to realize that there is something to this notion that a unifyingprinciple pervades all of physical reality.Isn’t it ironic, then, that we keep all of our attention on the 0.00001 percentof reality that is physical? Are we missing something?If this nothing consists of energy waves that carry information, and this forceorganizes our physical structures and their functioning, then it certainly makessense to refer to the quantum field as an invisible intelligence. And sinceenergy is at the basis of all physical reality, that intelligence I’ve justdescribed to you has organized itself into matter.Think of the preceding conversation as a kind of template for how thisintelligence has constructed reality. The quantum field is invisible potentialenergy that is able to organize itself from energy to subatomic particles toatoms to molecules, and on up the line to everything. From a physiologicalperspective, it organizes molecules into cells into tissues into organs intosystems, and finally into the body as a whole. Put another way, this potentialenergy lowers itself as a frequency of wave patterns until it appears as solid.It is this universal intelligence that gives life to that field and everythingin it, including you and me. This power is the same universal mind that animatesevery aspect of the material universe. This intelligence keeps our heartsbeating and our stomachs digesting food and oversees an incalculable number ofchemical reactions per second that take place in every cell. Moreover, the sameconsciousness prompts trees to grow fruit and causes distant galaxies to formand collapse.Because it exists in all places and times, and exerts its power within us andall around us, this intelligence is both personal and universal.As an Extension of This Intelligence, We Can Emulate ItUnderstand that this universal intelligence possesses the same awareness thatmakes us individuals—consciousness or mindfulness. Even though this power isuniversal and objective, it does possess a consciousness—an awareness of selfand its own ability to move and act within the material universe.It is also completely mindful on all levels—not just of itself but of you andme. Because this consciousness notices everything, it observes and paysattention to us. It is aware of our thoughts, our dreams, our behaviors, and ourdesires. It “observes” everything into physical form.How can a consciousness that has created all of life, that expends the energyand will to consistently regulate every function of our bodies to keep us alive,that has expressed such a deep and abiding interest in us, be anything but purelove?We’ve talked about two aspects of consciousness: the objectiveconsciousness/intelligence of the field; and the subjective consciousness thatis a free-willed, self-aware individual. When we emulate the properties of thisawareness, we are becoming creators. When we feel resonance with this lovingintelligence, we become like it. This intelligence will orchestrate an event, anenergetic response, to match whatever the subjective mind puts out into thequantum field. When our will matches its will, when our minds match its mind,when our love for life matches its love for life, we are enacting this universalconsciousness. We become the elevated power that transcends the past, heals thepresent, and opens doors to the future.We Get Back What We Send OutHere’s how this orchestration of events works in our lives. If we haveexperienced suffering, and within our minds and bodies we hold that sufferingand express it through our thoughts and feelings, we broadcast that energeticsignature into the field. The universal intelligence responds by sending intoour lives another event that will reproduce the same intellectual and emotionalresponse.Our thoughts send the signal out (I am suffering), and our emotions (I amsuffering) draw into our lives an event to match that emotional frequency—thatis, a good reason to suffer. In a very real sense, we are asking for proof ofthe existence of universal intelligence at all times, and it sends us feedbackin our external environment at all times. That is how powerful we are.The question at the heart of this book is this: Why don’t we send out a signalthat will produce a positive outcome for us? How can we change so that thesignal we send out matches what we intend to produce in our lives? We willchange when we fully commit to the belief that by choosing the thought/signal wesend out, we will produce an effect that is observable and unexpected.With this objective intelligence, we are not punished for our sins (that is, ourthoughts, feelings, and actions), but by them. When we project into the field asignal based on the thoughts and feelings (such as suffering) produced by someundesirable experience(s) in our past, is it any wonder that the field respondsin the same negative way?How many times have you uttered these words, or very similar ones: “I can’tbelieve it … why does this always happen to me?”Based on your new understanding of the nature of reality, do you now see thatthose statements reflect your acceptance of the Newtonian/Cartesian model inwhich you are a victim of cause and effect? Do you see that you are fullycapable of causing an effect yourself? Do you see that instead of responding inthe manner above, you could be asking yourself: How can I think, feel, andbehave differently to produce the effect/result that I want?Our mission, then, is to willfully move into the state of consciousness thatallows us to connect to universal intelligence, make direct contact with thefield of possibilities, and send out a clear signal that we truly expect tochange and to see the results that we want—in the form of feedback—produced inour lives.Ask for Quantum FeedbackWhen you do create purposefully, request a sign from the quantum consciousnessthat you have made contact with it. Dare to ask for synchronicities related toyour specific desired outcomes. When you do, you are being bold enough to wantto know that this consciousness is real and that it is aware of your efforts.Once you accept this, then you can create in a state of joy and inspiration.This principle asks us to lay down what we think we know, surrender to theunknown, then observe the effects in the form of feedback in our lives. And thatis the best way we learn. When we get positive indications (when we see ourexternal circumstances shift in a favorable direction), we know that whatever wedid inside of us was right. Naturally, we’ll remember what we did so we can doit again.So when feedback begins to occur in your life, you can choose to be like ascientist in a process of discovery. Why not monitor any changes, to see thatthe universe is favorable to your efforts and prove to yourself that you arethat powerful?So how can we connect with that state of consciousness?Quantum Physics Is “Non-sense”Newtonian physics postulated that there is always a linear series ofinteractions that are predictable and repeatable. You know: if A + B = C, then C+ D + E = F. But in the wacky world of the quantum model of reality, everythingis intercommunicating within a higher-dimensional field of information that isholistically entangled beyond space and time as we know it. Whew!One reason why quantum physics is so elusive is that for years we have beenaccustomed to thinking based on our senses. If we measure and reaffirm realitywith our senses, we are stuck in the Newtonian paradigm.Instead, the quantum model demands that our understanding of reality not bebased on our senses (quantum physics is non-sense). In the process of creatingfuture reality via the quantum model, our senses should be the last toexperience what the mind has created. The very last thing we experience issensory feedback. Why?The quantum is a multidimensional reality that exists beyond your senses, in arealm where there is no body, no thing, no time. Thus, to move into that domainand create from that paradigm, you’ll need to forget about your body for alittle while. You’ll also have to temporarily shift your awareness away fromyour external environment—all those things that you identify with in your life.Your spouse, your kids, your possessions, and your problems are all part of youridentity; through them, you identify with the outer world. And finally, you willhave to lose track of linear time. That is, in the moment when you areintentionally observing a potential future experience, you will have to be sopresent that your mind no longer vacillates between memories of the past andexpectations of a “same as usual” future.Isn’t it ironic that to influence your reality (environment), heal your body, orchange some event in your future (time), you have to completely let go of yourexternal world (no thing), you have to release your awareness of your body (nobody) … you have to lose track of time (no time)—in effect, you have to becomepure consciousness.Do that, and you have dominion over the environment, your body, and time. (Iaffectionately call these the Big Three.) And since the subatomic world of thefield is made purely of consciousness, you cannot enter any other way than viapure consciousness yourself. You cannot walk through the door into the quantumfield as a “somebody”; you must enter as a “no body.”Your brain has the innate ability to harness this skill (stay tuned for more).When you understand that you are fully equipped to do all this, leave this worldbehind, and enter a new reality beyond space and time, you will be naturallyinspired to apply it in your life.Going Beyond Space and TimeWhat does it mean to be beyond space and time? These are constructs that humanscreated to explain physical phenomena involving location and our sense of thetemporal. When we talk about a glass sitting on a table, we reference it interms of location (where it is in space) and how long it has occupied thatlocation. As humans we’re obsessed with these two conceptions: Where we are. Howlong we’ve been there. How long we will remain. Where we’ll go next. Even thoughtime is not something that we can actually sense, we feel it passing in much thesame way that we sense our location in space: we “feel” the seconds, minutes,and hours passing by, just as we feel our bodies pressed against our chairs andour feet planted on the ground.In the quantum field, the infinite probabilities for materializing reality arebeyond time and space, because a potential doesn’t yet exist. If it doesn’texist, it doesn’t have a location or occupy a position temporally. Anything thatdoesn’t have material existence—that hasn’t had its waves of probabilitycollapsed into particle reality—exists beyond space and time.Since the quantum field is nothing but immaterial probability, it is outside ofspace and time. As soon as we observe one of those infinite probabilities andgive it material reality, it acquires those two characteristics.To Enter the Field, Enter a Similar StateGreat—we have the power to make material a reality of our own choosing byselecting it from the quantum field. But we have to somehow access that field.We’re always connected to it, but how do we get the field to respond to us? Ifwe’re constantly emitting energy, and therefore sending information to the fieldand receiving information from it, how do we communicate more effectively withit?In upcoming chapters I will talk at length about how to enter the field. Fornow, what you need to know is that to enter the field, which exists beyond spaceand time, you have to enter a similar state.Do you ever have any experiences when time and space seem to disappear? Think ofthose moments when you’re driving and your thoughts are focused on some concernyou have. When that happens, you forget about your body (you are no longer awareof how you feel in space), you forget about the environment (the external worlddisappears), and you forget about time (you have no idea how long you are“tranced out”).At moments like these, you’ve been at the threshold of the door that allows youto enter the quantum field and gain access to working with universalintelligence. In essence, you’ve already made thought more real than anythingelse.Later on, I will provide instruction on how to move into that state ofconsciousness regularly, to access the field and to communicate more directlywith the universal intelligence that animates all things.Change Your Mind, Change Your LifeAs this chapter has progressed, I’ve led you from the notion that mind andmatter are fully separable to the quantum model, which states that they areinseparable. Mind is matter, and matter is mind.So all those times in the past when you tried to change, maybe your thinking wasfundamentally limited. You likely believed that it was always circumstancesoutside of you that needed to change: If I didn’t have so many othercommitments, I could lose the excess weight, and then I’d be happy. We’ve allstated some variation on that theme. If this, then that. Cause and effect.What if you could change your mind, your thoughts, your feelings, and your wayof being, outside the bounds of time and space? What if you could change aheadof time and see the effects of those “internal” changes in your “external”world?You can.What has profoundly and positively changed my life, and the lives of so manyothers, is the understanding that changing one’s mind—and thereby having newexperiences and gaining new insights—is simply a matter of breaking the habit ofbeing oneself. When you overcome your senses, when you understand that you arenot bound by the chains of your past—when you live a life that is greater thanyour body, your environment, and time—all things are possible. The universalintelligence that animates the existence of all things will both surprise anddelight you. It wants nothing more than to provide you with access to all youwant.In short, when you change your mind, you change your life.And a Child Shall Lead ThemBefore we move on, I’d like to share a story that illustrates just how powerfuland effective being in contact with the greater intelligence can be in makingchange an integral part of your life.My children, now young adults, have used a meditation similar to the process Iwill describe to you in Part III of this book. As a result of practicing thesetechniques, they’ve manifested some remarkable adventures. Since theirchildhood, we’ve had an agreement that they work on creating material things orevents that they want to experience. However, our rule is that I don’t interfereor assist with producing the outcome. They have to create intended realities ontheir own, using their minds and interacting with the quantum field.My 20-something daughter studies art in college. It was springtime, and I askedwhat she wanted to manifest during an upcoming summer break. She had a laundrylist! Instead of the typical college-student-home-for-the-summer job, she wantedto work in Italy, learn and experience new things, visit at least six Italiancities, and spend one week in Florence, since she had friends there. She wantedto work for the first six weeks of the summer, making a decent wage, then spendthe rest of the break at home.I commended my daughter for her clear vision of what she wanted, and remindedher that universal intelligence would orchestrate the way her dream summer wouldmanifest. She would take care of the “what”; a greater consciousness wouldhandle the “how.”Since my daughter is practiced in the art of thinking and feeling ahead of theactual experience, I merely reminded her to not only set an intention every daywith regard to what that summer would look like—what people she would see, whatevents would transpire, what places she would visit—but also to feel what itwould be like to experience these things. I asked her to create the vision inher mind until it was so clear and real that the thought she was thinking becamethe experience, and her brain’s synapses began to wire that information as if itwas a reality.If she was still “being” the young woman in the dorm room with a dream of goingto Italy, then she was still the same person living the same reality. So whileit was still March, she had to begin “being” that young woman who’d been inItaly for half the summer.“No problem,” she said. She’d had experiences like this before, when she wantedto be in a music video and when she wanted to experience an unlimited shoppingspree. Both of these transpired in perfect elegance.I then reminded my daughter, “You can’t get up from your mental creation of thisexperience as the same person you were when you sat down. You have to get upfrom your seat as if you just had the most amazing summer of your life.”“I got it,” she said. She understood my reminder that each day, she had tochange to a new state of being. And after every mental creation, she was to goabout her day living in the elevated mood of gratitude generated by having hadthat experience.My daughter called a few weeks later. “Dad, the university is offering an arthistory summer course in Italy. I can get the cost of the program and allexpenses down from $7,000 to $4,000. Can you help pay for that?”Well, it’s not that I’m an unsupportive parent, but this didn’t strike me aswhat she had originally stated as her target. She was trying to control theoutcome of this possible destiny instead of allowing the quantum field toorchestrate the events. I advised her to really inhabit that Italian trip and tothink, feel, speak, and dream “in Italian” until she got lost in the experience.A few weeks later when she called again, her excitement was palpable. She hadbeen in the library, chatting with her art history teacher, and they eventuallyslipped into speaking Italian; both spoke the language fluently. At that pointher teacher said, “I just remembered. One of my colleagues needs someone toteach Level I Italian to some American students who will be studying in Italythis summer.”Of course, my daughter was hired. Get this: not only would she be paid to teach(all expenses covered), but she would be in six different cities in Italy forsix weeks, spend the last week in Florence, and be able to be home for thesecond half of the summer. She manifested her dream job and every aspect of heroriginal vision.This wasn’t a case of a young woman pursuing this opportunity with thetraditional dogged determination to find a program—searching the Internet,hounding professors, and so forth. Instead of following cause and effect, mydaughter changed her state of being to the extent that she was causing aneffect. She was living by the quantum law.As she electromagnetically connected to an intended destiny that existed in thequantum, her body was then drawn to the future event. The experience found her.The outcome was unpredictable, it came in a way that she in no way expected, itwas synchronistic, and there was no doubt that it was the result of her internalefforts.Think about that for a moment. What opportunities are out there waiting to findyou? Who are you being in this moment … and every other moment? Is your beingthat way going to attract to you all that you desire?Can you change your state of being? And once you inhabit a new mind, can youobserve a new destiny? The answers are what the rest of this book is all about.img [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER TWO [toc.html#ch02]image [images/line.jpg]OVERCOMING YOUR ENVIRONMENT [toc.html#ch02]By now, I trust that you’re beginning to accept the idea that the subjectivemind has an effect on the objective world. You might even be keen to acknowledgethat an observer can affect the subatomic world and influence a specific event,just by collapsing a single electron from a wave of energy into a particle. Atthis point you may also believe the scientific experiments in quantum mechanicsI’ve discussed, which prove consciousness directly controls the tiny world ofatoms because those elements fundamentally are made of consciousness and energy.That’s quantum physics in action, right?But perhaps you’re still on the fence about the concept that your mind has real,measurable effects in your life. You may be asking yourself, How can my mindinfluence bigger events in order to change my life? How can I collapse electronsinto a specific event called a new experience that I want to embrace in somefuture time? I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re wondering about your ability tocreate life-size experiences in the larger world of reality.My goal is that you understand, and can see in action, how there might be ascientific basis for accepting that your thoughts can create your reality. Forthe doubter, though, I would like you to entertain the possibility that the wayyou think directly affects your life.Keep Revisiting Familiar Thoughts and Feelingsand You Keep Creating the Same RealityIf you can accept this paradigm as a possibility, then by pure reason, you wouldalso have to agree that the following is possible: to create something differentfrom what you’ve grown accustomed to in your personal world, you have to changethe way you routinely think and feel each day.Otherwise, by repeatedly thinking and feeling the same way you did the daybefore, and the day before that, you will continue to create the samecircumstances in your life, which will cause you to experience the sameemotions, which will influence you to think “equal to” those emotions.Going out on a limb here, permit me to compare this situation to the proverbialhamster in a wheel. As you continually think about your problems (consciously orunconsciously), you will only create more of the same type of difficulties foryourself. And maybe you think about your problems so much because it was yourthinking that created them in the first place. Perhaps your troubles feel soreal because you constantly revisit those familiar feelings that initiallycreated the problem. If you insist on thinking and feeling equal to thecircumstances in your life, you will reaffirm that particular reality.So in the next few chapters, I want to focus on what you need to understand inorder to change.To Change, Be Greater ThanYour Environment, Your Body, and TimeMost people focus on three things in life: their environment, their bodies, andtime. They don’t just focus on those three elements, they think equal to them.But to break the habit of being yourself, you have to think greater than thecircumstances of your life, be greater than the feelings that you have memorizedin your body, and live in a new line of time.If you want to change, you must have in your thoughts an idealized self—a modelthat you can emulate, which is different from, and better than, the “you” thatexists today in your particular environment, body, and time. Every great personin history knew how to do this, and you can attain greatness in your own lifeonce you master the concepts and techniques to come.In this chapter, we’ll focus on how you can overcome your environment, and laysome groundwork for the two chapters that follow, in which we’ll discuss how toovercome your body and time.Our Memories Make Up Our Internal EnvironmentBefore we begin talking about how you can break the habit of being yourself, Iwant to appeal to your common sense for a few moments. How did this habit ofthinking and feeling in the same way, over and over, begin?I can only answer that by talking about the brain—the starting point of ourthoughts and feelings. Current neuroscientific theory tells us that the brain isorganized to reflect everything we know in our environment. All the informationwe have been exposed to throughout our lives, in the form of knowledge andexperiences, is stored in the brain’s synaptic connections.The relationships with people we’ve known, the variety of things we own and arefamiliar with, the places where we’ve visited and lived at different times inour lives, and the myriad experiences we’ve embraced throughout our years areall configured in the structures of the brain. Even the vast array of actionsand behaviors that we’ve memorized and repeatedly performed throughout ourlifetimes are imprinted in the intricate folds of our gray matter.Hence, all of our personal experiences with people and things at specific timesand places are literally reflected within the networks of neurons (nerve cells)that make up our brains.What do we collectively call all these “memories” of people and things that weexperienced at different places and times in our lives? That’s our externalenvironment. For the most part, our brains are equal to our environment, arecord of our personal past, a reflection of the life we’ve lived.During our waking hours, as we routinely interact with the diverse stimuli inour world, our external environment activates various brain circuits. As aconsequence of that nearly automatic response, we begin to think (and react)equal to our environment. As the environment causes us to think, familiarnetworks of nerve cells fire that reflect previous experiences already wired inthe brain. Essentially, we automatically think in familiar ways derived frompast memories.If your thoughts determine your reality, and you keep thinking the same thoughts(which are a product and reflection of the environment), then you will continueto produce the same reality day after day. Thus, your internal thoughts andfeelings exactly match your external life, because it is your outer reality—withall of its problems, conditions, and circumstances—that is influencing howyou’re thinking and feeling in your inner reality.Familiar Memories “Re-mind” Usto Reproduce the Same ExperiencesEvery day, as you see the same people (your boss, for example, and your spouseand kids), do the same things (drive to work, perform your daily tasks, and dothe same workout), go to the same places (your favorite coffee shop, the grocerystore you frequent, and your place of employment), and look at the same objects(your car, your house, your toothbrush … even your own body), your familiarmemories related to your known world “re-mind” you to reproduce the sameexperiences.We could say that the environment is actually controlling your mind. Since theneuroscientific definition of mind is the brain in action, you repeatedlyreproduce the same level of mind by “re-minding” yourself who you think you arein reference to the outer world. Your identity becomes defined by everythingoutside of you, because you identify with all of the elements that make up yourexternal world. Thus, you’re observing your reality with a mind that is equal toit, so you collapse the infinite waves of probabilities of the quantum fieldinto events that reflect the mind you use to experience your life. You createmore of the same.You may not think that your environment and your thoughts are that rigidlysimilar and your reality so easily reproduced. But when you consider that yourbrain is a complete record of your past, and your mind is the product of yourconsciousness, in one sense you might always be thinking in the past. Byresponding with the same brain hardware that matches what you remember, you’recreating a level of mind that is identical to the past, because your brain isautomatically firing existing circuits to reflect everything you already know,have experienced, and thus can predict. According to quantum law (which, by theway, is still working for you), your past is now becoming your future.Reason this: When you think from your past memories, you can only create pastexperiences. As all of the “knowns” in your life cause your brain to think andfeel in familiar ways, thus creating knowable outcomes, you continually reaffirmyour life as you know it. And since your brain is equal to your environment,then each morning, your senses plug you into the same reality and initiate thesame stream of consciousness.All of the sensory input that your brain processes from the external world (thatis, seeing, smelling, hearing, feeling, and tasting) turns your brain on tothink equal to everything familiar in your reality. You open your eyes and youknow the person lying next to you is your spouse because of your pastexperiences together. You hear barking outside your door, and you know it’s yourdog wanting to go out. There’s a pain in your back, and you remember it’s thesame pain you felt yesterday. You associate your outer, familiar world with whoyou think you are, by remembering yourself in this dimension, this particulartime and space.Our Routines: Plugging into Our Past SelfWhat do most of us do each morning after we’ve been plugged into our reality bythese sensory reminders of who we are, where we are, and so forth? Well, weremain plugged into this past self by following a highly routine, unconsciousset of automatic behaviors.For example, you probably wake up on the same side of the bed, slip into yourrobe the same way as always, look into the mirror to remember who you are, andshower following an automatic routine. Then you groom yourself to look likeeveryone expects you to look, and brush your teeth in your usual memorizedfashion. You drink coffee out of your favorite mug and eat your customarybreakfast cereal. You put on the jacket you always wear and unconsciously zip itup.Next, you automatically drive to work along your accustomed, convenient route.At work you do the familiar things that you have memorized how to do so well.You see the same people, who push your same emotional buttons, which causes youto think the same thoughts about those people and your work and your life.Later, you hurry up and go home, so you can hurry up and eat, so you can hurryup and watch your favorite TV show, so you can hurry up and go to bed, so youcan hurry up and do it all over again. Has your brain changed at all that day?Why are you secretly expecting something different to show up in your life, whenyou think the same thoughts, perform the same actions, and experience the sameemotions every single day? Isn’t that the definition of insanity? All of us havefallen prey to this type of limited life, one time or another. By now, youunderstand the reason why.In the preceding example, it is safe to say that you’re reproducing the samelevel of mind, every day. And if the quantum world shows that the environment isan extension of your mind (and that mind and matter are one), then as long asyour mind remains the same, your life will stay “status quo.”Thus, if your environment remains the same and you react by thinking in the sameway, then according to the quantum model of reality, shouldn’t you create moreof the same? Think of it this way: the input remains the same, so the output hasto remain the same. How, then, can you ever create anything new?Hardwired to Hard TimesThere is another possible consequence that I should mention, if you keep firingthe same neural patterns by living your life the same way each day. Every timeyou respond to your familiar reality by re-creating the same mind (that is,turning on the same nerve cells to make the brain work in the same way), you“hardwire” your brain to match the customary conditions in your personalreality, be they good or bad.There is a principle in neuroscience called Hebb’s law. It basically states that“nerve cells that fire together, wire together.” Hebb’s credo demonstrates thatif you repeatedly activate the same nerve cells, then each time they turn on, itwill be easier for them to fire in unison again. Eventually those neurons willdevelop a long-term relationship.1 [endnotes.html#ch02_en1]So when I use the word hardwired, it means that clusters of neurons have firedso many times in the same ways that they have organized themselves into specificpatterns with long-lasting connections. The more these networks of neurons fire,the more they wire into static routes of activity. In time, whatever theoft-repeated thought, behavior, or feeling is, it will become an automatic,unconscious habit. When your environment is influencing your mind to thatextent, your habitat becomes your habit.So if you keep thinking the same thoughts, doing the same things, and feelingthe same emotions, you will begin to hardwire your brain into a finite patternthat is the direct reflection of your finite reality. Consequently, it willbecome easier and more natural for you to reproduce the same mind on amoment-to-moment basis.This innocent response cycle causes your brain and then your mind to reinforceeven further the particular reality that is your external world. The more youfire the same circuits by reacting to your external life, the more you’ll wireyour brain to be equal to your personal world. You’ll become neurochemicallyattached to the conditions in your life. In time, you’ll begin to think “in thebox,” because your brain will fire a finite set of circuits that then creates avery specific mental signature. This signature is called your personality.How You Form the Habit of Being YourselfAs an effect of this neural habituation, the two realities of the inner mind andthe outer world seem to become almost inseparable. For instance, if you cannever stop thinking about your problems, then your mind and your life will mergetogether as one. The objective world is now colored by the perceptions of yoursubjective mind, and thus reality continuously conforms. You become lost in theillusion of the dream.You could call this a rut, and we all fall into them, but it goes much deeperthan that: not just your actions, but also your attitudes and your feelingsbecome repetitive. You have formed the habit of being yourself by becoming, in asense, enslaved to your environment. Your thinking has become equal to theconditions in your life, and thus you, as the quantum observer, are creating amind that only reaffirms those circumstances into your specific reality. All youare doing is reacting to your external, known, unchanging world.In a very real way, you have become an effect of circumstances outside ofyourself. You have allowed yourself to give up control of your destiny. UnlikeBill Murray’s character in the movie Groundhog Day, you’re not even fightingagainst the ceaseless monotony of what you are like and what your life hasbecome. Worse, you aren’t the victim of some mysterious and unseen force thathas placed you in this repetitive loop—you are the creator of the loop.The good news is that since you created this loop, you can choose to end it.The quantum model of reality tells us that to change our lives, we mustfundamentally change the ways we think, act, and feel. We must change our stateof being. Because how we think, feel, and behave is, in essence, ourpersonality, it is our personality that creates our personal reality. So tocreate a new personal reality, a new life, we must create a new personality; wemust become someone else.To change, then, is to think and act greater than our present circumstances,greater than our environment.Greatness Is Holding Fast to a Dream,Independent of the EnvironmentBefore I begin to explore the ways in which you can think greater than yourenvironment and thus break the habit of being yourself, I want to remind you ofsomething.It is possible to think greater than your present reality, and history books arefilled with names of people who have done so, men and women such as MartinLuther King, Jr., William Wallace, Marie Curie, Mahatma Gandhi, Thomas Edison,and Joan of Arc. Every one of these individuals had a concept in his or her mindof a future reality that existed as a potential in the quantum field. Thisvision was alive in an inner world of possibilities beyond the senses, and intime, each of these people made those ideas a reality.As a common thread, they all had a dream, vision, or objective that was muchlarger than they were. They all believed in a future destiny that was so real intheir minds that they began to live as if that dream were already happening.They couldn’t see, hear, taste, smell, or feel it, but they were so possessed bytheir dream that they acted in a way that corresponded to this potential realityahead of time. In other words, they behaved as if what they envisioned wasalready a reality.For example, the imperialist dictum that had India under colonial rule in theearly 1900s was demoralizing to Indians. Despite that, Gandhi believed in areality that wasn’t yet present in his people’s lives. He wholeheartedlyendorsed the concepts of equality, freedom, and nonviolence with undyingconviction.Even though Gandhi endorsed liberty for all, the reality of tyranny and Britishcontrol at that time was quite different. The conventional beliefs of that erawere in contrast to his hopes and aspirations. Although the experience ofliberty was not a reality while he was initially engaged in changing India, hedid not let outward evidence of adversity sway him to give up this ideal.For a long time, much of the feedback from the external world didn’t show Gandhithat he was making a difference. But seldom did he allow the conditions in hisenvironment to control his way of being. He believed in a future that he couldnot yet see or experience with his senses, but which was so alive in his mindthat he could not live any other way. He embraced a new future life whilephysically living his present life. He understood that the way he was thinking,acting, and feeling would change the current conditions in his environment. Andeventually, reality began to change as a result of his efforts.When our behaviors match our intentions, when our actions are equal to ourthoughts, when our minds and our bodies are working together, when our words andour deeds are aligned … there is an immense power behind any individual.History’s Giants:Why Their Dreams Were “Unrealistic Nonsense”The greatest individuals in history were unwaveringly committed to a futuredestiny without any need for immediate feedback from the environment. It didn’tmatter to them if they hadn’t yet received any sensory indication or physicalevidence of the change they wanted; they must have reminded themselves daily ofthe reality they were focused upon. Their minds were ahead of their presentenvironment, because their environment no longer controlled their thinking.Truly, they were ahead of their time.Another fundamental element shared by each of these celebrated beings was thatthey were clear in their minds about exactly what they wanted to happen.(Remember, we leave the how to a greater mind, and they must have known this.)Now, some in their day might have called them unrealistic. In fact, they werecompletely unrealistic, and so were their dreams. The event they were embracingin thought, action, and emotion was not realistic, because the reality had notyet occurred. The ignorant and the cynical might also have said their vision wasnonsense, and such naysayers would have been right—a vision of future realitywas “non-sense”; it existed in a reality beyond the senses.As another example, Joan of Arc was considered foolhardy, even insane. Her ideaschallenged the beliefs of her time and made her a threat to the presentpolitical system. But once her vision was made manifest, she was consideredprofoundly virtuous.When one holds a dream independent of the environment, that’s greatness. Comingup, we’ll see that overcoming the environment is inextricably linked withovercoming the body and time. In Gandhi’s case, he was not swayed by what washappening in his outer world (environment), he didn’t worry about how he feltand what would happen to him (body), and he didn’t care how long it would taketo realize the dream of freedom (time). He simply knew that all of theseelements would sooner or later bend to his intentions.For all of the giants in history, is it possible that their ideas were thrivingin the laboratory of their minds to such an extent that to their brains, it wasas though the experience had already happened? Can you, too, change who you areby thought alone?Mental Rehearsal:How Our Thoughts Can Become Our ExperienceNeuroscience has proven that we can change our brains—and therefore ourbehaviors, attitudes, and beliefs—just by thinking differently (in other words,without changing anything in our environment). Through mental rehearsal(repeatedly imagining performing an action), the circuits in the brain canreorganize themselves to reflect our objectives. We can make our thoughts soreal that the brain changes to look like the event has already become a physicalreality. We can change it to be ahead of any actual experience in our externalworld.Here’s an example. In Evolve Your Brain, I discussed how research subjects whomentally rehearsed one-handed piano exercises for two hours a day for five days(never actually touching any piano keys) demonstrated almost the same brainchanges as people who physically performed the identical finger movements on apiano keyboard for the same length of time.2 [endnotes.html#ch02_en2] Functionalbrain scans showed that all the participants activated and expanded clusters ofneurons in the same specific area of the brain. In essence, the group whomentally rehearsed practicing scales and chords grew nearly the same number ofbrain circuits as the group who physically engaged in the activity.This study demonstrates two important points. Not only can we change our brainsjust by thinking differently, but when we are truly focused and single-minded,the brain does not know the difference between the internal world of the mindand what we experience in the external environment. Our thoughts can become ourexperience.This notion is critical to your success or failure in your endeavor to replaceold habits (prune old neural connections) with new ones (sprout new neuralnetworks). So let’s look more closely at how the same learning sequence tookplace in those people who mentally practiced but never physically played anynotes.img [images/logo1.jpg]Whether we physically or mentally acquire a skill, there are four elements thatwe all use to change our brains: learning knowledge, receiving hands-oninstruction, paying attention, and repetition.Learning is making synaptic connections; instruction gets the body involved inorder to have a new experience, which further enriches the brain. When we alsopay attention and repeat our new skill over and over again, our brains willchange.The group who physically played the scales and chords grew new brain circuitsbecause they followed this formula.The participants who mentally rehearsed also followed this formula, except thatthey never got their bodies physically involved. In their minds they were easilyable to conceive of themselves playing the piano.Remember, after these subjects repeatedly mentally practiced, their brainsshowed the same neurological changes as the participants who actually played thepiano. New networks of neurons (neural networks) were forged, demonstrating thatin effect, they had already engaged in practicing piano scales and chordswithout actually having that physical experience. We could say that their brains“existed in the future” ahead of the physical event of playing the piano.Because of our enlarged human frontal lobe and our unique ability to makethought more real than anything else, the forebrain can naturally “lower thevolume” from the external environment so that nothing else is being processedbut a single-minded thought. This type of internal processing allows us tobecome so involved in our mental imaging that the brain will modify its wiringwithout having experienced the actual event. When we can change our mindsindependent of the environment and then steadfastly embrace an ideal withsustained concentration, the brain will be ahead of the environment.That is mental rehearsal, an important tool in breaking the habit of beingourselves. If we repeatedly think about something to the exclusion of everythingelse, we encounter a moment when the thought becomes the experience. When thisoccurs, the neural hardware is rewired to reflect the thought as the experience.This is the moment that our thinking changes our brains and thus, our minds.To understand that neurological change can take place in the absence of physicalinteractions in the environment is crucial to our success in breaking the habitof being ourselves. Consider the larger implications of the finger-exerciseexperiment. If we apply the same process—mental rehearsal—to anything that wewant to do, we can change our brains ahead of any concrete experience.If you can influence your brain to change before you experience a desired futureevent, you will create the appropriate neural circuits that will enable you tobehave in alignment with your intention before it becomes a reality in yourlife. Through your own repeated mental rehearsal of a better way to think, act,or be, you will “install” the neural hardware needed to physiologically prepareyou for the new event.In fact, you’ll do more than that. The brain’s hardware, as I use the analogy inthis book, refers to its physical structures, its anatomy, right down to itsneurons. If you keep installing, reinforcing, and refining your neurologicalhardware, the end result of that repetition is a neural network—in effect, a newsoftware program. Just like computer software, this program (for example, abehavior, an attitude, or an emotional state) now runs automatically.Now you’ve cultivated the brain to be ready for your new experience, andfrankly, you have the mind in place so that you can handle the challenge. Whenyou change your mind, your brain changes; and when you change your brain, yourmind changes.So when the time comes to demonstrate a vision contrary to the environmentalconditions at hand, it is quite possible for you to be already prepared to thinkand act, with a conviction that is steadfast and unwavering. In fact, the moreyou formulate an image of your behavior in a future event, the easier it will befor you to execute a new way of being.So can you believe in a future you cannot yet see or experience with your sensesbut have thought about enough times in your mind that your brain is actuallychanged to look like the experience has already happened ahead of the physicalevent in your external environment? If so, then your brain is no longer a recordof the past, but has become a map to the future.Now that you know you can change your brain by thinking differently, is itpossible to change your body to “look like” it too has had an experience aheadof the actual intended circumstances? Is your mind that powerful? Stay tuned.img [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER THREE [toc.html#ch03]image [images/line.jpg]OVERCOMINGYOUR BODY [toc.html#ch03]You do not think in a vacuum. Every time you have a thought, there is abiochemical reaction in the brain—you make a chemical. And as you’ll learn, thebrain then releases specific chemical signals to the body, where they act asmessengers of the thought. When the body gets these chemical messages from thebrain, it complies instantly by initiating a matching set of reactions directlyin alignment with what the brain is thinking. Then the body immediately sends aconfirming message back up to the brain that it’s now feeling exactly the waythe brain is thinking.To understand this process—how you typically think equal to your body, and howto form a new mind—you first need to appreciate the role that your brain and itschemistry plays in your life. In the last few decades, we’ve discovered that thebrain and the rest of the body interact via powerful electrochemical signals.There is an extensive chemical factory between our ears that orchestrates amyriad of bodily functions. But relax, this is going to be “Brain Chemistry101,” and a few terms are all that you need to know.All cells have receptor sites on their exterior surface that receive informationfrom outside their boundaries. When there is a match in chemistry, frequency,and electrical charge between a receptor site and an incoming signal from theoutside, the cell gets “turned on” to perform certain tasks.img [images/p54.jpg]Figure 3A. A cell with receptor sites that receive vital incoming informationfrom outside the cell. The signal can influence the cell to perform myriadbiological function.Neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and hormones are the cause-and-effectchemicals for brain activity and bodily functioning. These three different typesof chemicals, called ligands (the word ligare means “to bind” in Latin), connectto, interact with, or influence the cell in a matter of milliseconds.— Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that primarily send signals betweennerve cells, allowing the brain and nervous system to communicate. There aredifferent types of neurotransmitters, and each is responsible for a particularactivity. Some excite the brain, others slow it down, while still others make ussleepy or awake. They can tell a neuron to unhook from its current connection ormake it stick better to its present connection. They can even change the messageas it is being sent to a neuron, rewriting it so that a different message isdelivered to all the connected nerve cells.— Neuropeptides, the second type of ligand, make up the majority of thesemessengers. Most are manufactured in a structure of the brain called thehypothalamus (recent studies show that our immune system also makes them). Thesechemicals are passed through the pituitary gland, which then releases a chemicalmessage to the body with specific instructions.— As neuropeptides make their way through the bloodstream, they attach to thecells of various tissues (primarily glands) and then turn on the third type ofligand, hormones, which further influence us to feel certain ways. Neuropeptidesand hormones are the chemicals responsible for our feelings.For our purposes, think of neurotransmitters as chemical messengers primarilyfrom the brain and mind, neuropeptides as chemical signalers that serve as abridge between the brain and the body to make us feel the way we think, andhormones as the chemicals related to feelings primarily in the body.img [images/p56.jpg]Figure 3B. Neurotransmitters are diverse chemical massengers between neurons.Neuropeptides are chemical couriers that signal different glands of the body tomake hormones.For example, when you have a sexual fantasy, all three of these factors arecalled to action. First, as you start to think a few thoughts, your brain whipsup some neurotransmitters that turn on a network of neurons, which createspictures in your mind. These chemicals then stimulate the release of specificneuropeptides into your bloodstream. Once they reach your sexual glands, thosepeptides bind to the cells of those tissues; they turn on your hormonal system,and—presto—things start happening. You’ve made your fantasy thoughts so real inyour mind that your body starts to get prepared for an actual sexual experience(ahead of the event). That’s how powerfully mind and body are related.By the same means, if you start to think about confronting your teenager overthe new dent in the car, your neurotransmitters would start the thought processin your brain to produce a specific level of mind, your neuropeptides wouldchemically signal your body in a specific way, and you would begin to feel a bitriled up. As the peptides find their way to your adrenal glands, they would thenbe prompted to release the hormones adrenaline and cortisol—and now you aredefinitely feeling fired up. Chemically, your body is ready for battle.The Thinking and Feeling LoopAs you think different thoughts, your brain circuits fire in correspondingsequences, patterns, and combinations, which then produce levels of mind equalto those thoughts. Once these specific networks of neurons are activated, thebrain produces specific chemicals with the exact signature to match thosethoughts so that you can feel the way you were just thinking.Therefore, when you have great thoughts or loving thoughts or joyous thoughts,you produce chemicals that make you feel great or loving or joyful. The sameholds true if you have negative, fearful, or impatient thoughts. In a matter ofseconds, you begin to feel negative or anxious or impatient.There’s a certain synchronicity that takes place moment by moment between thebrain and the body. In fact, as we begin to feel the way we are thinking—becausethe brain is in constant communication with the body—we begin to think the waywe are feeling. The brain constantly monitors the way the body is feeling. Basedon the chemical feedback it receives, it will generate more thoughts thatproduce chemicals corresponding to the way the body is feeling, so that we firstbegin to feel the way we think and then to think the way we feel.img [images/p58.jpg]Figure 3C. The neurochemical relationship between the brain and the body. As youthink certain thoughts, the brain produces chemicals that cause you to feelexactly the way you were thinking. Once you feel the way you think, you begin tothink the way you feel. This continuous cycle creates a feedback loop called a“state of being”We will delve deeper into this idea throughout the book, but consider thatthoughts are primarily related to the mind (and the brain), and feelings areconnected to the body. Therefore, as the feelings of the body align to thoughtsfrom a particular state of mind, mind and body are now working together as one.And as you’ll recall, when the mind and body are in unison, the end product iscalled a “state of being.” We could also say that the process of continuouslythinking and feeling and feeling and thinking creates a state of being, whichproduces effects on our reality.A state of being means we have become familiar with a mental-emotional state, away of thinking and a way of feeling, which has become an integral part of ourself-identity. And so we describe who we are by how we are thinking (and thusfeeling) or being in the present moment. I am angry; I am suffering; I aminspired; I am insecure; I am negative….But years of thinking certain thoughts, and then feeling the same way, and thenthinking equal to those feelings (the hamster in the wheel) creates a memorizedstate of being in which we can emphatically declare our I am statement as anabsolute. That means we’re now at the point when we define ourselves as thisstate of being. Our thoughts and feelings have merged.For example, we say: I have always been lazy; I am an anxious person; I amtypically uncertain of myself; I have worthiness issues; I am short-tempered andimpatient; I am really not that smart; and so on. And those particular memorizedfeelings contribute to all our personality traits.Warning: when feelings become the means of thinking, or if we cannot thinkgreater than how we feel, we can never change. To change is to think greaterthan how we feel. To change is to act greater than the familiar feelings of thememorized self.As a practical example, let’s say you’re driving to work this morning and youbegin to think about the heated encounter you had a few days ago with aco-worker. As you think the thoughts associated with that person and thatparticular experience, your brain starts releasing chemicals that circulatethrough your body. Very quickly, you begin to feel exactly the way you werethinking. You probably become angry.Your body sends a message back to your brain, saying, Yup, I’m feeling reallyticked off. Of course, your brain, which constantly communicates with the bodyand monitors its internal chemical order, is influenced by the sudden change inthe way you’re feeling. As a result, you begin to think differently. (The momentyou begin to feel the way you think, you begin to think the way you feel.) Youunconsciously reinforce the same feeling by continuing to think angry andfrustrated thoughts, which then make you feel more angry and frustrated. Ineffect, your feelings are now controlling your thinking. Your body is nowdriving your mind.As the cycle goes on, your angry thoughts produce more chemical signals to yourbody, which activate the adrenal chemicals associated with your angry feelings.Now you become enraged and aggressive. You feel flushed, your stomach is twistedinto a knot, your head pounds, and your muscles start to clench. As all thoseheightened feelings flood the body and change its physiology, this chemicalcocktail fires up a set of circuits in the brain, causing you to think equal tothose emotions.Now you’re telling your associate off ten different ways in the privacy of yourown mind. You indignantly conjure up a litany of past events that validate yourpresent upset, brainstorming through a letter recounting all those complaintsyou’ve always wanted to lodge. In your mind, you’ve already forwarded it to yourboss before you even arrive at work. You exit the car dazed and crazed and abreath away from homicidal. Hello, walking, talking model of an angry person …and all of this started with a single thought. In this moment, it seemsimpossible to think greater than you feel—and that’s why it’s so hard to change.The result of this cyclic communication between your brain and body is that youtend to react predictably to these kinds of situations. You create patterns ofthe same familiar thoughts and feelings, you unconsciously behave in automaticways, and you are mired in these routines. This is how the chemical “you”functions.Does Your Mind Control Your Body?Or Does Your Body Control Your Mind?Why is it so hard to change?Imagine that your mother loved to suffer, and through long observation, youunconsciously saw that this behavior pattern enabled her to get what she wantedin life. Let’s also say that you’ve had a few tough experiences in your ownlife, which created quite a bit of suffering for you. Those memories stillelicit an emotional reaction, centered around a specific person at a particularplace at a certain time in your life. You’ve thought about the past oftenenough, and somehow, those memories are easy to recall, even automatic. Nowimagine that for more than 20 years, you’ve practiced thinking and feeling,feeling and thinking, about suffering.Actually, you no longer need to think about the past event to create thefeeling. You can’t seem to think or act any other way than how you always feel.You’ve memorized suffering by your recurrent thoughts and feelings—those relatedto that incident, as well as other events in your life. Your thoughts aboutyourself and your life tend to be colored by feelings of victimization andself-pity. Repeating the same thoughts and feelings you’ve courted for more than20 years has conditioned your body to remember the feeling of suffering withoutmuch conscious thought. This seems so natural and normal now. It’s who you are.And anytime you try to change anything about yourself, it’s like the road turnsback on you. You’re right back to your old self.What most people don’t know is that when they think about a highly chargedemotional experience, they make the brain fire in the exact sequences andpatterns as before; they are firing and wiring their brains to the past byreinforcing those circuits into ever more hardwired networks. They alsoduplicate the same chemicals in the brain and body (in varying degrees) as ifthey were experiencing the event again in that moment. Those chemicals begin totrain the body to further memorize that emotion. Both the chemical results ofthinking and feeling, feeling and thinking, as well as the neurons firing andwiring together, condition the mind and the body into a finite set of automaticprograms.We are capable of reliving a past event over and over, perhaps thousands oftimes in one lifetime. It is this unconscious repetition that trains the body toremember that emotional state, equal to or better than the conscious mind does.When the body remembers better than the conscious mind—that is, when the body isthe mind—that’s called a habit.Psychologists tell us that by the time we’re in our mid-30s, our identity orpersonality will be completely formed. This means that for those of us over 35,we have memorized a select set of behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, emotionalreactions, habits, skills, associative memories, conditioned responses, andperceptions that are now subconsciously programmed within us. Those programs arerunning us, because the body has become the mind.This means that we will think the same thoughts, feel the same feelings, reactin identical ways, behave in the same manner, believe the same dogmas, andperceive reality the same ways. About 95 percent of who we are by midlife1[endnotes.html#ch03_en1] is a series of subconscious programs that have becomeautomatic—driving a car, brushing our teeth, overeating when we’re stressed,worrying about our future, judging our friends, complaining about our lives,blaming our parents, not believing in ourselves, and insisting on beingchronically unhappy, just to name a few.Often We Only Appear to Be AwakeSince the body becomes the subconscious mind, it’s easy to see that insituations when the body becomes the mind, the conscious mind no longer has muchto do with our behavior. The instant we have a thought, feeling, or reaction,the body runs on automatic pilot. We go unconscious.Take, for example, a mother driving a minivan to drop her kids off at school.How is she able to navigate traffic, break up arguments, drink her coffee, shiftgears, and help her son blow his nose … all at once? Much like a computerprogram, these actions have become automatic functions that can run very fluidlyand easily. Mom’s body is skillfully doing everything because it has memorizedhow to do all these deeds through much repetition. She no longer has anyconscious thought about how she does them; they are habitual.Think about that: 5 percent of the mind is conscious, struggling against the 95percent that is running subconscious automatic programs. We’ve memorized a setof behaviors so well that we have become an automatic, habitual body-mind. Infact, when the body has memorized a thought, action, or feeling to the extentthat the body is the mind—when mind and body are one—we are (in a state of)being the memory of ourselves. And if 95 percent of who we are by age 35 is aset of involuntary programs, memorized behaviors, and habitual emotionalreactions, it follows that 95 percent of our day, we are unconscious. We onlyappear to be awake. Yikes!So a person may consciously want to be happy, healthy, or free, but theexperience of hosting 20 years of suffering and the repeated cycling of thosechemicals of pain and pity have subconsciously conditioned the body to be in ahabitual state. We live by habit when we’re no longer aware of what we’rethinking, doing, or feeling; we become unconscious.The greatest habit we must break is the habit of being ourselves.image [images/lin2.jpg]When the Body Is Running the ShowHere are some practical illustrations of the body being in a habitual state.Have you ever been unable to consciously remember a phone number? Try as youmay, you can’t even recall three digits out of the string of numbers required tomake the call. And yet, you can pick up the phone and watch as your fingers dialthe number. Your conscious, thinking brain can’t remember the number, but you’vepracticed this action so many times with your fingers that your body now knowsand remembers better than your brain. (That example was for those of us who grewup before speed dial or cell phones came along; perhaps you’ve had the sameexperience with typing your PIN into an ATM or entering a password online.)Similarly, I can recall times when I worked out at a gym and had a locker with acombination lock. I was so tired after the workout that I couldn’t remember thecombination. I’d stare at that dial, trying to recall the sequence of threenumbers, and they wouldn’t surface. However, when I started to twirl the dial,the combination would come back to me, almost as if by magic. Again, thishappens because we practiced something so many times that our bodies know betterthan our conscious minds. The body subconsciously has become the mind.Remember that 95 percent of who we are by age 35 sits in the same subconsciousmemory system, in which the body automatically runs a programmed set ofbehaviors and emotional reactions. In other words, the body is running the show.image [images/lin2.jpg]When the Servant Becomes the MasterIn truth, the body is the servant of the mind. It follows that if the body hasbecome the mind, the servant has become the master. And the former master (theconscious mind) has gone to sleep. The mind might think it’s still in charge,but the body is influencing decisions equal to its memorized emotions.Now, let’s say the mind wants to get back in control. What do you think the bodyis going to say?Where have you been? Go back to sleep. I’ve got it together here. You don’t havethe will, the persistence, or the awareness to do what I have been doing allthis time while you were unconsciously following my orders. I even modified myreceptor sites over the years in order to serve you better. You thought you wererunning things, while I have been influencing you all along and urging you tomake all of your decisions equal to what feels right and familiar.And when the 5 percent that is conscious is going against 95 percent that isrunning subconscious automatic programs, the 95 percent is so reflexive that itonly takes one stray thought or a single stimulus from the environment to turnon the automatic program again. Then we’re back to same old, same old—thinkingthe same thoughts, performing the same actions, but expecting somethingdifferent to happen in our lives.When we try to regain control, this is when the body signals the brain to begintalking us out of our conscious goals. Our internal chatter comes up with abattery of reasons why we should not attempt to do anything out of the ordinary,not break out of the habituated state of being that we’re used to. It will pickup all of our weaknesses, which it knows and fosters, and hurl them at us one byone.We create worst-case scenarios in our minds so that we don’t have to rise abovethose familiar feelings. Because when we try to break the internal chemicalorder we have made so second nature, the body goes into chaos. Its internalbadgering feels nearly irresistible—and plenty of times, we succumb.Enter into the Subconscious to Change ItThe subconscious mind only knows what you have programmed it to do. Have youever been typing along on your laptop, and all of a sudden your computer startsrunning automatic programs that you have no control over? When you try to usethe conscious mind to stop the automatic, subconscious programs stored in yourbody, it’s like yelling at a computer that’s gone rogue, with several programsrunning while windows are popping up and showing more than you can handle. Hey!Stop that! The computer isn’t even going to register that. It’s going to keepdoing what it does until there is some sort of intervention—until you get intoits operating system and change some settings.In this book, you will learn how to get into the subconscious, and reprogram itwith a new set of strategies. In effect, you have to unlearn, or unwire, yourold thinking and feeling patterns and then relearn, or rewire, your brain withnew patterns of thinking and feeling, based on who you want to be instead. Whenyou condition the body with a new mind, the two can no longer work inopposition, but must be in harmony. This is the point of change … ofself-creation.Guilty Until Proven InnocentLet’s use a real-life situation to illustrate what happens when we decide tobreak from some memorized emotional state and change our minds. I think we canall relate to one common state of being: guilt. So I’m going to use that toillustrate in practical terms how this cycle of thinking and feeling worksagainst us. Then we’ll identify some of the efforts the brain-body system isgoing to make to remain in control and preserve that negative state of being.Imagine that you frequently feel guilty about one thing or another. If somethinggoes wrong in a relationship—a simple miscommunication, someone unreasonablymisplacing his or her anger on you, or whatever—you wind up taking the blame andfeeling bad. Picture yourself as one of those people who repeatedly say orthink, It was my fault.After 20 years of doing this to yourself, you feel guilty and think guiltythoughts automatically. You have created an environment of guilt for yourself.Other factors have contributed to this, but for now, let’s stay with this notionof how your thinking and feeling have created your state of being and yourenvironment.Every time you think a guilty thought, you’ve signaled your body to produce thespecific chemicals that make up the feeling of guilt. You’ve done this so oftenthat your cells are swimming in a sea of guilt chemicals.The receptor sites on your cells adapt so that they can better take in andprocess this particular chemical expression, that of guilt. The enormous amountof guilt bathing the cells begins to feel normal to them, and eventually, whatthe body perceives as normal starts to be interpreted as pleasurable. It’s likeliving for years near an airport. You get so used to the noise that you nolonger hear it consciously, unless one jet flies lower than usual and the roarof its engines is so much louder that it gets your attention. The same thinghappens to your cells. As a result, they literally become desensitized to thechemical feeling of guilt; they will require a stronger, more powerful emotionfrom you—a higher threshold of stimuli—to turn on the next time. And when thatstronger “hit” of guilt chemicals gets the body’s attention, your cells “perkup” at that stimulation, much like that first cup of java feels to a coffeedrinker.And when each cell divides at the end of its life and makes a daughter cell, thereceptor sites on the outside of the new cell will require a higher threshold ofguilt to turn them on. Now the body demands a stronger emotional rush of feelingbad in order to feel alive. You become addicted to guilt by your own doing.When anything goes wrong or is awry in your life, you automatically assume thatyou’re the guilty party. But that seems normal to you now. You don’t even haveto think about feeling guilty—you just are that way. Not only is your mind notconscious of how you express your guilty state by way of the things you say anddo, but your body wants to feel its accustomed level of guilt, because that’swhat you have trained it to do. You have become unconsciously guilty most of thetime—your body has become the mind of guilt.Only when, say, a friend points out that you needn’t have apologized to thestore clerk for giving you the wrong change do you realize how pervasive thisaspect of your personality has become. Let’s say that this triggers one of thosemoments of enlightenment—an epiphany—and you think, She’s right. Why do Iapologize all the time? Why do I take responsibility for everyone else’smissteps? After you reflect on your history of constantly “pleading guilty,” yousay to yourself, Today I’m going to stop blaming myself and making excuses forother people’s bad behavior. I’m going to change.Because of your decision, you’re no longer going to think the same thoughts thatproduce the same feelings, and vice versa. And if you falter, you’ve made a dealwith yourself that you’re going to stop and remember your intention. Two hoursgo by and you feel really good about yourself. You think, Wow, this is actuallyworking.Unfortunately, your body’s cells aren’t feeling so good. Over the years, you’vetrained them to demand more molecules of emotion (guilt, in this case) in orderto fulfill their chemical needs. You had trained your body to live as amemorized chemical continuity, but now you’re interrupting that, denying it itschemical needs and going contrary to its subconscious programs.The body becomes addicted to guilt or any emotion in the same way that it wouldget addicted to drugs.2 [endnotes.html#ch03_en2] At first you only need a littleof the emotion/drug in order to feel it; then your body becomes desensitized,and your cells require more and more of it just to feel the same again. Tryingto change your emotional pattern is like going through drug withdrawal.Once your cells are no longer getting the usual signals from the brain aboutfeeling guilty, they begin to express concern. Before, the body and the mindwere working together to produce this state of being called guilt; now you areno longer thinking and feeling, feeling and thinking, in the same way. Yourintention is to produce more positive thoughts, but the body is still all revvedup to produce feelings of guilt based on guilty thoughts.Think of this as a kind of highly specialized assembly line. Your brain hasprogrammed the body to expect one part that will fit into this larger assembly.All of a sudden, you’ve sent it another part that doesn’t fit into the spacewhere the old “guilty” part once did. An alarm goes off, and the whole operationcomes to a standstill.Your cells are always spying on what is happening in the brain and the mind;your body is the best mind reader ever. So they all stop what they are doing,look up toward the brain, and think:What are you doing up there? You insisted on being guilty, and we loyallyfollowed your commands for years! We subconsciously memorized a program of guiltfrom your repetitive thoughts and feelings. We changed our receptor sites toreflect your mind—modified our chemistry so that you could automatically feelguilty. We have maintained your internal chemical order, independent of anyexternal circumstances in your life. We are so used to the same chemical orderthat your new state of being feels uncomfortable, unfamiliar. We want thefamiliar, the predictable, and what feels natural. All of a sudden you’re goingto change? We can’t have that!So the cells huddle up and say: Let’s send a protest message to the brain. Butwe have to be sneaky, because we want her to think that she’s actuallyresponsible for these thoughts. We don’t want her to know they came from us. Sonow the cells send a message marked URGENT right up the spinal cord to thesurface of the thinking brain. I call that the “fast track,” because the messagegoes straight up the central nervous system in a matter of seconds.At the same time this is happening, the chemistry of the body—the chemistry ofguilt—is now at a lower level, because you’re not thinking and feeling the sameway. But this drop does not go unnoticed. A thermostat in the brain called thehypothalamus also sends out an alarm that says: Chemical values are going down.We’ve got to make more!So the hypothalamus signals the thinking brain to revert back to its oldhabitual ways. This is the “slow track,” because it takes longer for thechemicals to circulate through the bloodstream. The body wants you to return toyour memorized chemical self, so it influences you to think in familiar, routineways.These “fast track” and “slow track” cellular responses occur simultaneously. Andthe next thing you know, you start to hear the chatter of thoughts like these inyour head: You’re too tired today. You can start tomorrow. Tomorrow’s a betterday. Really, you can do it later. And my favorite: This doesn’t feel right.If that doesn’t work, a second sneak attack occurs. The body-mind wants to be incontrol again, so it starts picking on you a bit: It’s okay for you to feel alittle bad right now. It’s your father’s fault. Don’t you feel bad about whatyou did in your past? In fact, let’s take a look at your past so we can rememberwhy you are this way. Look at you—you’re a mess, a loser. You’re pathetic andweak. Your life is a failure. You’ll never change. You’re too much like yourmother. Why don’t you just quit. As you continue this “awfulizing,” the body istempting the mind to return to the state it has unconsciously memorized. On arational level, that is absurd. But obviously, on some level it feels good tofeel bad.The moment we listen to those subvocalizations, believe those thoughts, andrespond by feeling the same familiar feelings, mental amnesia sets in and weforget our original aim. The funny thing is that we actually begin to believewhat the body is telling the brain to say to us. We immerse ourselves back intothat automatic program and return to being our old self.Most of us can relate to this little scenario. It’s no different from any habitwe’ve tried to break. Whether we’re addicted to cigarettes, chocolate, alcohol,shopping, gambling, or biting our nails, the moment we cease the habitualaction, chaos rages between the body and the mind. The thoughts we embrace areintimately identified with the feelings of what it would be like to experiencethe indulgence. When we give in to the cravings, we will keep producing the sameoutcomes in our lives, because the mind and body are in opposition. Our thoughtsand feelings are working against each other, and if the body has become themind, we will always fall prey to how we feel.As long as we use familiar feelings as a barometer, as feedback on our effortsto change, we’ll always talk ourselves out of greatness. We will never be ableto think greater than our internal environment. We will never be able to see aworld of possible outcomes other than the negative ones from our past. Ourthoughts and feelings have that much power over us.Help Is Only a Thought AwayThe next step in breaking the habit of being ourselves is understanding howimportant it is to get the mind and body working together and to break thechemical continuity of our guilty, ashamed, angry, depressed state of being.Resisting the body’s demand to restore that old unhealthy order isn’t easy, buthelp is only a thought away.You will learn in the following pages that for true change to occur, it isessential to “unmemorize” an emotion that has become part of your personality,and then to recondition the body to a new mind.It’s easy to feel hopeless when we realize that the chemistry of our emotionshas habituated our bodies to a state of being that is too often a product ofanger, jealousy, resentment, sadness, and so forth. After all, I’ve said thatthese programs, these propensities, are buried in our subconscious.The good news is that we can become consciously aware of these tendencies. I’lldeal more with this concept in the pages ahead. For now, I hope you can acceptthat to change your personality, you need to change your state of being, whichis intimately connected to feelings that you’ve memorized. Just as negativeemotions can become embedded in the operating system of your subconscious, socan positive ones.By Itself, Conscious Positive Thinking CannotOvercome Subconscious Negative FeelingsAt one time or another, we’ve all consciously declared: I want to be happy. Butuntil the body is instructed otherwise, it’s going to continue expressing thoseprograms of guilt or sadness or anxiety. The conscious, intellectual mind mayreason that it wants joy, but the body has been programmed to feel otherwise foryears. We stand on a soapbox proclaiming change to be in our best interests, buton a visceral level we can’t seem to bring up the feeling of true happiness.That’s because mind and body aren’t working together. The conscious mind wantsone thing, but the body wants another.If you’ve been devoted to feeling negatively for years, those feelings havecreated an automatic state of being. We could say that you are subconsciouslyunhappy, right? Your body has been conditioned to be negative; it knows how tobe unhappy better than your conscious mind knows otherwise. You don’t even haveto think about how to be negative. You just know that it’s how you are. How canyour conscious mind control this attitude in the subconscious body-mind?Some maintain that “positive thinking” is the answer. I want to be clear that byitself, positive thinking never works. Many so-called positive thinkers havefelt negative most of their lives, and now they’re trying to think positively.They are in a polarized state in which they are trying to think one way in orderto override how they feel inside of them. They consciously think one way, butthey are being the opposite. When the mind and body are in opposition, changewill never happen.Memorized Feelings Limit Us to Re-creating the PastBy definition, emotions are the end products of past experiences in life.When you’re in the midst of an experience, the brain receives vital informationfrom the external environment through five different sensory pathways (sight,smell, sound, taste, and touch). As that cumulative sensory data reaches thebrain and is processed, networks of neurons arrange themselves into specificpatterns reflecting the external event. The moment those nerve cells string intoplace, the brain releases chemicals. Those chemicals are called an “emotion” ora “feeling.” (In this book, I use the words feelings and emotionsinterchangeably because they are close enough for our understanding.)When those emotions begin to chemically flood your body, you detect a change inyour internal order (you’re thinking and feeling differently than you weremoments before). Naturally, when you notice this change in your internal state,you’ll pay attention to whoever or whatever in your external environment causedthat change. When you can identify whatever it was in your outer world thatcaused your internal change, that event in and of itself is called a memory.Neurologically and chemically, you encode that environmental information intoyour brain and body. Thus you can remember experiences better because you recallhow they felt at the time they happened—feelings and emotions are a chemicalrecord of past experiences.For example, your boss arrives for your performance review. You noticeimmediately that he looks red faced, even irritated. As he starts speaking in aloud voice, you smell garlic on his breath. He accuses you of undermining him infront of other employees, and says he has passed you over for a promotion. Inthis moment you feel jittery, weak in the knees, and queasy; and your heart isracing. You feel fearful, betrayed, and angry. All of the cumulative sensoryinformation—everything you’re smelling, seeing, feeling, and hearing—is changingyour internal state. You associate that external experience with a change in howyou’re feeling internally, and it brands you emotionally.You go home and repeatedly review this experience in your mind. Every time youdo, you remind yourself of the accusing, intimidating look on your employer’sface, how he yelled at you, what he said, and even how he smelled. Then you onceagain feel fearful and angry; you produce the same chemistry in your brain andbody as if the performance review is still happening. Because your body believesit is experiencing the same event again and again, you are conditioning it tolive in the past.Let’s reason this a bit further. Think of your body as the unconscious mind, oras an objective servant that takes orders from your consciousness. It is soobjective that it doesn’t know the difference between the emotions that arecreated from experiences in your external world and those you fabricate in yourinternal world by thought alone. To the body, they are the same.What if this cycle of thinking and feeling that you were betrayed continues foryears on end? If you keep dwelling on that experience with your boss or relivingthose familiar feelings, day in and day out, you continually signal your bodywith chemical feelings that it associates with the past. This chemicalcontinuity fools the body into believing that it is still reexperiencing thepast, so the body keeps reliving the same emotional experience. When yourmemorized thoughts and feelings consistently force your body to “be in” thepast, we could say that the body becomes the memory of the past.If those memorized feelings of betrayal have been driving your thoughts foryears, then your body has been living in the past 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,52 weeks a year. In time, your body is anchored in the past.You know that when you repeatedly re-create the same emotions until you cannotthink any greater than how you feel, your feelings are now the means of yourthinking. And since your feelings are a record of previous experiences, you’rethinking in the past. And by quantum law, you create more of the past.Bottom line: Most of us live in the past and resist living in a new future. Why?The body is so habituated to memorizing the chemical records of our pastexperiences that it grows attached to these emotions. In a very real sense, webecome addicted to those familiar feelings. So when we want to look to thefuture and dream of new vistas and bold landscapes in our not-too-distantreality, the body, whose currency is feelings, resists the sudden change indirection.Accomplishing this about-face is the great labor of personal change. So manypeople struggle to create a new destiny, but find themselves unable to overcomethe past memory of who they feel they are. Even if we crave unknown adventuresand dream of new possibilities ahead in the future, we seem to be compelled torevisit the past.Feelings and emotions are not bad. They are the end products of experience. Butif we always relive the same ones, we can’t embrace any new experiences. Haveyou known people who always seem to talk about “the good old days”? What they’rereally saying is: Nothing new is happening in my life to stimulate my feelings;therefore I’ll have to reaffirm myself from some glorious moments in the past.If we believe that our thoughts have something to do with our destiny, then ascreators, most of us are only going in circles.Controlling Our Inner Environment:The Genetic MythSo far, in discussing how the quantum model of reality relates to change, I’vespent most of the time talking about our emotions, the brain, and the body.We’ve seen that overcoming the recurring thoughts and feelings that the bodymemorizes is a must if we are to break the habit of being ourselves.Another major aspect of breaking this habit has to do with our physical health.Certainly, in the hierarchy of things that most of us want to change about ourlives, health issues rank way up there. And when it comes to what we’d like tochange about our health, there is one set of dogmas that we’re going to have toexamine and dispel—the myth that genes create disease and the fallacy of geneticdeterminism. We will also look at a scientific understanding that may be new toyou, called epigenetics: the control of genes from outside the cell, or moreprecisely, the study of changes in gene function that occur without a change inDNA sequence.3 [endnotes.html#ch03_en3]Just as we can create new experiences for ourselves, like my daughter did, wecan also gain control of a very important part of our lives—what we commonlythink of as our genetic destiny. As we go along, you will see that knowingsomething about your genes and what signals them to be expressed or not iscrucial to understanding why you have to change from the inside out.Scientific dictum used to declare that our genes were responsible for mostdiseases. Then a couple of decades ago, the scientific community casuallymentioned that they had been in error, and announced that the environment, byactivating or deactivating particular genes, is the most causative factor inproducing disease. We now know that less than 5 percent of all diseases todaystem from single-gene disorders (such as Tay-Sachs and Huntington’s chorea),whereas around 95 percent of all illnesses are related to lifestyle choices,chronic stress, and toxic factors in the environment.4 [endnotes.html#ch03_en4]Yet factors in the outer environment are only part of the picture. What explainswhy two people can be exposed to the same toxic environmental conditions and onegets sick or diseased while the other doesn’t? How is it that when someone hasmultiple personality disorder, one personality can demonstrate a severe allergyto something, while another personality in that same body can be immune to thesame antigen or stimulus? Why, when most health-care providers are exposed topathogens on a daily basis, aren’t doctors and others in the medical communitycontinually ill?There are also numerous case studies documenting identical twins (who share thesame genes) who have had very different experiences when it came to their healthand longevity. For example, if both shared a family history of a particulardisease, that illness often manifested in one twin but not the other. Samegenes, different outcomes.5 [endnotes.html#ch03_en5]In all these cases, could the person who remains healthy have such a coherent,balanced, vital internal order that even when his or her body is exposed to thesame hazardous environmental conditions, the external world does nothing to hisor her gene expression, and so doesn’t signal the genes to create disease?It’s true that the external environment influences our internal environment.However, by changing our internal state of being, can we overcome the effects ofa stressful or toxic environment so that certain genes do not become activated?We may not be able to control all the conditions in our external environment,but we certainly have a choice in controlling our inner environment.Genes: Memories of the Past EnvironmentTo explain how we can control our inner environment, I need to talk a bit aboutthe nature of genes, which are expressed in the body when cells manufacturespecific proteins, the building blocks of life.The body is a protein-producing factory. Muscle cells make muscle proteins thatare called actin and myosin, skin cells make skin proteins called collagen andelastin, and stomach cells make stomach proteins called enzymes. Most of thecells of the body make proteins, and genes are the way we make them. We expressparticular genes via certain cells making particular proteins.The way most organisms adapt to conditions in their environment is throughgradual genetic modifications. For example, when an organism is faced with toughenvironmental conditions such as temperature extremes, dangerous predators, fastprey, destructive winds, strong currents, and so on, it is forced to overcomethe adverse aspects of its world in order to survive. As organisms record thoseexperiences, in the wiring in their brains and the emotions in their bodies,they will change over time. If lions are chasing prey that can outrun them, thenby actively engaging the same experiences for generations, they will developlonger legs, sharper teeth, or bigger hearts. All of these changes are theresult of genes making proteins that modify the body to adapt to itsenvironment.Let’s stay with the animal world to look at how this works in terms ofadaptation or evolution. A hypothetical group of mammals migrated to anenvironment in which the temperature ranged from -15 to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.The genes in those mammals, over many generations of living under extremely coldconditions, would eventually be triggered to produce a new protein, which wouldproduce thicker and greater amounts of fur (hair and fur are proteins).Numerous insect species have evolved the ability to camouflage themselves. Somethat live in trees or other foliage have adapted to look like twigs or thorns,enabling them to escape the notice of birds. The chameleon is probably the bestknown of the “camouflagers,” and it owes its color-changing abilities to thegenetic expression of proteins. In these processes, genes encode the conditionsof the external world. That’s evolution, right?Epigenetics Suggests That We Can SignalOur Genes to Rewrite Our FutureOur genes are as changeable as our brains. The latest research in genetics showsthat different genes are activated at different times—they are always in fluxand being influenced. There are experience-dependent genes that are activatedwhen there is growth, healing, or learning; and there arebehavioral-state-dependent genes that are influenced during stress, emotionalarousal, or dreaming.6 [endnotes.html#ch03_en6]One of the most active areas of research today is epigenetics (literally, “abovegenetics”), the study of how the environment controls gene activity. Epigeneticsflies in the face of the conventional genetic model, which stated that DNAcontrols all of life and that all gene expression takes place inside the cell.This old understanding doomed us to a predictable future in which our destinyfell prey to our genetic inheritance, and all cellular life was predetermined,like an automatic “ghost in the machine.”In fact, epigenetic changes in DNA expression can be passed on to futuregenerations. But how do they get passed on if the DNA code stays the same?While a scientific explanation is beyond the scope of this book, we can use ananalogy. Let’s compare a genetic sequence to a blueprint. Imagine that you startwith a blueprint for a house, and scan it into your computer. Then, usingPhotoshop, you could alter its appearance on the screen, changing a number ofcharacteristics without changing the blueprint. For example, you could changethe expression of variables such as color, size, scale, dimensions, materials,and so on. Thousands of people (representing environmental variables) couldproduce different images, but they would all be expressions of that sameblueprint.Epigenetics empowers us to think about change more profoundly. The epigeneticparadigm shift gives us free will to activate our own gene activity and modifyour genetic destiny. For the sake of example and simplification, when I talkabout activating a gene by expressing it in different ways, I will refer to“turning it on.” In reality, genes don’t turn on or off; they are activated bychemical signals, and they express themselves in specific ways by making variousproteins.Just by changing our thoughts, feelings, emotional reactions, and behaviors (forexample, making healthier lifestyle choices with regard to nutrition and stresslevel), we send our cells new signals, and they express new proteins withoutchanging the genetic blueprint. So while the DNA code stays the same, once acell is activated in a new way by new information, the cell can create thousandsof variations of the same gene. We can signal our genes to rewrite our future.Perpetuating Old States of Being Sets UsUp for an Undesirable Genetic DestinyJust as certain areas of the brain are hardwired, whereas other areas are moreplastic (able to be changed by learning and experience), I believe genes are thesame way. There are certain parts of our genetics that are more easily turnedon; while other genetic sequences are somewhat more hardwired, which means theyare harder to activate, because they have been around longer in our genetichistory. At least, that’s what science says right now.How do we keep certain genes turned on and others turned off? If we stay in thesame toxic state of anger, the same melancholy state of depression, the samevigilant state of anxiety, or the same low state of unworthiness, thoseredundant chemical signals we have talked about keep pushing the same geneticbuttons, which ultimately cause the activation of certain diseases. Stressfulemotions, as you will learn, actually pull the genetic trigger, dysregulatingthe cells (dysregulation refers to impairment of a physiological regulatorymechanism) and creating disease.When we think and feel in the same ways for most of our lives and memorizefamiliar states of being, our internal chemical state keeps activating the samegenes, meaning that we keep making the same proteins. But the body cannot adaptto these repeated demands, and it begins to break down. If we do that for 10 or20 years, the genes begin to wear out, and they start making “cheaper” proteins.What do I mean? Think about what happens when we age. Our skin sags because itscollagen and elastin come to be made of cheaper proteins. What happens to ourmuscles? They atrophy. Well, no surprise there—actin and myosin, too, areproteins.Here’s an analogy. When a metal part for your car is manufactured, it isproduced in a die or a mold. Each time that mold or die is used, it is subjectedto certain forces, including heat and friction, which begin to wear it down. Asyou might guess, car parts are built to very close tolerances (referring to thepermitted variation in a workpiece’s dimensions). Over time, that die or moldwears to the point that it produces parts that won’t fit properly to otherparts. This is similar to what happens to the body. As a result of stress or ahabit of being repeatedly and consistently angry, fearful, sad, and so on, theDNA that the peptides use to produce proteins will start to malfunction.What is the genetic impact if we stay in routine, familiar conditions—creatingthe same emotional reactions by doing the same things, thinking the samethoughts, seeing the same people, and memorizing our lives into a predictablepattern? We are now headed for an undesirable genetic destiny; we are lockedinto the same patterns as generations before us, which confronted the same orsimilar situations. And if we are only reliving our emotional memories of thepast, then we are headed for a predictable end—our bodies will begin to createthe same genetic conditions that previous generations faced.Thus, the body will stay the same as long as we are feeling the same way, day inand day out. And if science tells us that it is the environment that signals thegenes involved in evolution, what if our environment never changes? What ifwe’ve memorized the same conditions in our outer world and we’re living by thesame thoughts, behaviors, and feelings? What if everything in our lives staysthe same?img [images/logo1.jpg]You just learned that the external environment chemically signals genes throughthe emotions of an experience. So if the experiences in your life aren’tchanging, the chemical signals going to your genes aren’t changing. No newinformation from the outer world is reaching your cells.The quantum model asserts that we can signal the body emotionally and begin toalter a chain of genetic events without first having any actual physicalexperience that correlates to that emotion. We don’t need to win the race, thelottery, or the promotion before we experience the emotions of those events.Remember, we can create an emotion by thought alone. We can experience joy orgratitude ahead of the environment to such an extent that the body begins tobelieve that it is already “in” that event. As a result, we can signal our genesto make new proteins to change our bodies to be ahead of the presentenvironment.Can Elevated States of Mind ProduceHealthier Expression of Genes?Here’s an example of how we can signal new genes in new ways when we begin toemotionally embrace an event in the future before it is made manifest.In Japan, a study was conducted to find out what effect one’s state of mindmight have on disease. The subjects were two groups of patients with type 2diabetes, all of whom were dependent on insulin. Keep in mind that mostdiabetics medicate with insulin to remove sugar (glucose) out of the bloodstreamand deposit it in the cells, where it can be used for energy. At the time ofthis study, the people involved were being treated with insulin pills orinjections to help control their elevated blood-sugar levels.7[endnotes.html#ch03_en7]Each group had their fasting blood-sugar level tested to establish a baseline.Next, one set of subjects watched a comedy show for an hour, while the controlgroup watched a boring lecture. The test subjects then ate a delicious meal,after which their blood-glucose levels were checked again.There was a significant discrepancy between the subjects who enjoyed the comedyshow and those who viewed the uneventful lecture. On average, those who watchedthe lecture had their blood-sugar levels rise 123 mg/dl—high enough that theywould need to take insulin to keep themselves out of the danger zone. In thejoyful group, who had laughed for one hour, their after-dinner blood-sugarvalues rose about half that amount (slightly outside of normal range).Initially, the researchers who performed the experiment thought that thelighthearted subjects had lowered their sugar levels by contracting theirabdominal and diaphragm muscles when they laughed. They reasoned that when amuscle contracts, it uses energy—and circulating energy is glucose.But the research went further. They examined the gene sequences of the jovialindividuals and discovered that these diabetics had altered 23 different geneexpressions just by laughing at the comedy show they’d seen. Their elevatedstate of mind apparently triggered their brains to send new signals to theircells, which turned on those genetic variations that allowed their bodies tonaturally begin to regulate the genes responsible for processing blood sugar.Our emotions can turn on some gene sequences and turn off others, this studyclearly showed. Just by signaling the body with a new emotion, the laughingsubjects altered their internal chemistry to change the expression of theirgenes.Sometimes a change in genetic expression can be sudden and dramatic. Have youever heard of people, after being subjected to extremely stressful conditions,whose hair turned gray overnight? That’s an example of genes at work. Theyexperienced such a strong emotional reaction that their altered body chemistryboth turned on the gene for the expression of gray hair and shut off the geneticexpression for their normal hair color, within a matter of hours. They signalednew genes in new ways by emotionally, and thus chemically, altering theirinternal environment.As I discussed in the last chapter, when you’ve “experienced” an event numeroustimes by mentally rehearsing every aspect of it in your mind, you feel what thatevent would feel like, before it unfolds. Then as you change the circuitry inyour brain by thinking in new ways, and you embrace the emotions of an eventahead of its physical manifestation, it’s possible that you can change your bodygenetically.Can you pick a potential from the quantum field (every potential already exists,by the way) and emotionally embrace a future event before the actual experience?Can you do this so many times that you emotionally condition the body to a newmind, thus signaling new genes in new ways? If you can, it is highly possiblethat you will begin to shape and mold your brain and body into a new expression… so that they physically change before the desired potential reality is mademanifest.Changing Your Body: Why Lift a Finger?We may believe that we can change our brains by thinking, but what effects, ifany, will this have on the body? Through the simple process of mentallyrehearsing an activity, we can derive great benefits without lifting a finger.Here’s an example of how that literally happened.As described in an article published in the 1992 Journal of Neurophysiology,8[endnotes.html#ch03_en8] subjects were divided into three groups: * The first group was asked to exercise by contracting and relaxing one finger on their left hand, for five one-hour training sessions per week for four weeks. * A second group mentally rehearsed the same exercises, on the same timetable, without physically activating any muscles in the finger. * People in a control group exercised neither their fingers nor their minds.At the end of the study, the scientists compared the findings. The first set ofparticipants had their finger strength tested against the control group. Ano-brainer, right? The group who did the actual exercises exhibited 30 percentgreater finger strength than those in the control group. We all know that if werepeatedly put a load on a muscle, we will increase the strength of that muscle.What we probably wouldn’t anticipate is that the group who mentally rehearsedthe exercises demonstrated a 22 percent increase in muscle strength! The mind,then, produced a quantifiable physical effect on the body. In other words, thebody changed without having an actual physical experience.Just as researchers have worked with test subjects who mentally rehearsed fingerexercises and others who imagined playing piano scales, experiments havecompared practical experience versus mental rehearsal for individuals doingbicep curls. The results were the same. Whether the participants physicallyperformed bicep curls or mentally rehearsed those activities, they all increasedtheir bicep strength. The mental exercisers, though, demonstrated physiologicalchanges without ever having the physical experience.9 [endnotes.html#ch03_en9]When the body has changed physically/biologically to look like an experience hashappened just by thought or mental efforts alone, then from a quantumperspective, this offers evidence that the event has already transpired in ourreality. If the brain upgrades its hardware to look like the experiencephysically occurred and the body is changed genetically or biologically (it isshowing evidence that it happened), and both are different without our “doing”anything in three dimensions, then the event has occurred both in the quantumworld of consciousness and in the world of physical reality.When you have thoughtfully rehearsed a future reality until your brain hasphysically changed to look like it has had the experience, and you haveemotionally embraced a new intention so many times that your body is altered toreflect that it has had the experience, hang on … because this is the moment theevent finds you! And it will arrive in a way that you least expect, which leavesno doubt that it came from your relationship to a greater consciousness—so thatit inspires you to do it again and again.img [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER FOUR [toc.html#ch04]image [images/line.jpg]OVERCOMING TIME [toc.html#ch04]So much has been written about the importance of staying present. I could citestatistics on everything from distracted driving to divorce to support thenotion that people have a really hard time staying in the present moment. Let meadd to that body of knowledge by expressing this concept in quantum terms. Inthe present, all potentials exist simultaneously in the field. When we staypresent, when we are “in the moment,” we can move beyond space and time, and wecan make any one of those potentials a reality. When we are mired in the past,however, none of those new potentials exist.You’ve learned that when human beings try to change, we react much like addicts,because we become addicted to our familiar chemical states of being. You knowthat when you have an addiction, it is almost as if your body has a mind of itsown. As past events trigger the same chemical response as the original incident,your body thinks it is reexperiencing the same event. Once conditioned to be thesubconscious mind through this process, the body has taken over for the mind—ithas become the mind and therefore can, in a sense, think.I just touched upon how the body becomes the mind by the cycle of thinking andfeeling, feeling and thinking. But there is another way in which this occurs,based on past memories.Here is how it works: You have an experience, which has an emotional charge.Then you have a thought about that particular past event. The thought becomes amemory, which then reflexively reproduces the emotion of the experience. If youkeep thinking about that memory repeatedly, the thought, the memory, and theemotion merge as one, and you “memorize” the emotion. Now living in the pastbecomes less of a conscious process and more of a subconscious one.img [images/p86.jpg]Figure 4A. The thought produces a, memory, which creates an emotion. In time,the thought becomes the memory, and an emotion follows. If this process isrepeated enough time, the thought is the memory, which is the emotion. Wememorize the emotion.The subconscious comprises most physical and mental processes that take placebelow our conscious awareness. Much of its activity is involved in keeping thebody functioning. Scientists refer to this regulatory system as the autonomicnervous system. We don’t have to consciously think about breathing, keeping ourhearts beating, raising and lowering our body temperature, or any of the othermillions of processes that help the body maintain order and heal itself.I think that you can see how potentially dangerous it is for us to cede controlover our daily emotional responses to our memories and environment—to thisautomatic system. This subconscious set of routine responses has been variouslycompared to an autopilot system and to programs running in the background of acomputer. What those analogies are trying to convey is the sense that there issomething below the surface of our awareness that is in control of how webehave.Here’s an example to reinforce these points. Imagine that in your youth, youcame home one day and discovered your favorite pet lying dead on the floor.Every sensory impression of that experience would be, as the expression goes,burned into your brain. That experience would scar you.With traumatic experiences like that, it’s easy to understand how those emotionscan become unconscious, memorized responses to reminders from your environmentthat you lost a loved one. You know by now that when you think about thatexperience, you create the same emotions in your brain and body as if the eventwas occurring all over again. All it takes is one stray thought, or one reactionto some event in the external world, to activate that program—and you startfeeling the emotion of your past grief. The trigger could be seeing a dog thatlooks like yours, or visiting a place you once took him as a puppy. Regardlessof the sensory input, it activates an emotion. Those emotional triggers can beobvious or subtle, but they all affect you at a subconscious level, and beforeyou can process what has happened, you’re back in that emotional/chemical stateof grief, anger, and sadness.Once that happens, the body runs the mind. You can use your conscious mind totry to get out of that emotional state, but invariably you feel like you’re outof control.Think of Pavlov and his dogs. In the 1890s, the young Russian scientist strappeda few dogs to a table, rang a bell, and then fed the canines a hearty meal. Overtime, after repeatedly exposing the dogs to the same stimulus, he simply rangthe bell, and the dogs automatically salivated in anticipation.This is called a conditioned response, and the process occurs automatically.Why? Because the body begins to respond autonomically (think of our autonomicnervous system). The cascade of chemical reactions that is triggered withinmoments changes the body physiologically, and it happens quitesubconsciously—with little or no conscious effort.This is one of the reasons why it is so hard to change. The conscious mind maybe in the present, but the subconscious body-mind is living in the past. If webegin to expect a predictable future event to occur in reference to a memory ofthe past, we are just like those canines. One experience of a particular personor thing at a specific time and place from the past automatically (orautonomically) causes us to respond physiologically.Once we break the emotional addictions rooted in our past, there will no longerbe any pull to cause us to return to the same automatic programs of the oldself.It begins to make sense that although we “think” or “believe” we are living inthe present, there is a good possibility that our bodies are in the past.Emotions to Moods to Temperaments to Personality Traits:Conditioning the Body to Live in the PastUnfortunately for most of us, because the brain always works by repetition andassociation, it doesn’t take a major trauma to produce the effect of the bodybecoming the mind.1 [endnotes.html#ch04_en1] The most minor triggers can produceemotional responses that feel as though they are beyond our control.For instance, you’re driving to work and you stop at your usual coffee shop,which is all out of your favorite, hazelnut coffee. Disappointed, you grumble toyourself why a major enterprise like this one can’t keep in stock such a verypopular flavor. At work, you’re irritated to see another car in your preferredparking spot. Stepping into an empty elevator, you are exasperated to discoverthat someone ahead of you pushed all the buttons.When you finally walk into the office, someone comments, “What’s up? You seemkind of down.”You tell your story, and the person sympathizes. You sum it up: “I’m in a badmood. I’ll get over it.”The thing is, you don’t.A mood is a chemical state of being, generally short-term, that is an expressionof a prolonged emotional reaction. Something in your environment—in this case,the failure of your barista to meet your needs, followed by a few other minorannoyances—sets off an emotional response. The chemicals of that emotion don’tget used up instantly, so their effect lingers for a while. I call that therefractory period—the time after their initial release and until the effectdiminishes.2 [endnotes.html#ch04_en2] The longer the refractory period,obviously, the longer you experience those feelings. When the chemicalrefractory period of an emotional reaction lasts for hours to days, that’s amood.What happens when that recently triggered mood lingers? You’ve been in a bit ofa funk since that day, and now you look around the room during a staff meetingand all you think of is that this person’s tie is hideous, and the nasally toneof your boss is worse than nails on a chalkboard.At this point, you’re not just in a mood. You’re reflecting a temperament, atendency toward the habitual expression of an emotion through certain behaviors.A temperament is an emotional reaction with a refractory period that lasts fromweeks to months.Eventually, if you keep the refractory period of an emotion going for months andyears, that tendency turns into a personality trait. At that point others willdescribe you as “bitter” or “resentful” or “angry” or “judgmental.”Our personality traits, then, are frequently based in our past emotions. Most ofthe time, personality (how we think, act, and feel) is anchored in the past. Soto change our personalities, we have to change the emotions that we memorize. Wehave to move out of the past.img [images/p90.jpg]Figure 4B. The progression of different refractory periods. An experiencecreates an emotional reaction, which then can turn into a mood, then into atemperament, and finally into a personality trait. We, as personalities,memorize our emotional reaction and live in the past.We Can’t Change When Living in the Predictable FutureThere is yet another way that we get stuck and keep ourselves from changing. Wemay also train the body to be the mind in order to live in a predictable future,based on the memory of the known past—and thus we miss the precious “now” momentagain.As you know, we can condition the body to live in the future. Of course, thatcan be a means to change our lives for the better, when we make a consciouschoice to focus on a desired new experience, as my daughter did when she createdher summer job in Italy. As her story demonstrates, if we focus on an intendedfuture event and then plan how we will prepare or behave, there will be a momentwhen we are so clear and focused on that possible future that the thoughts weare thinking will begin to become the experience itself. Once the thoughtbecomes the experience, its end product is an emotion. When we begin toexperience the emotion of that event ahead of its possible occurrence, the body(as the unconscious mind) begins to respond as though the event is actuallyunfolding.On the other hand, what happens if we begin to anticipate some unwanted futureexperience, or even obsess about a worst-case scenario, based on a memory fromour past? We are still programming the body to experience a future event beforeit occurs. Now the body is no longer in the moment or in the past; it is livingin the future—but a future based on some construct of the past.When this occurs, the body does not know the difference between the actual eventtranspiring in reality and what we are entertaining mentally. Because we arepriming it to be juiced up for whatever we think might be coming, the bodybegins to get ready. And in a very real way, the body is in the event.Here’s an example of living in the future, based on the past. Imagine thatyou’ve been asked to give a lecture in front of 350 people, but you fear beingonstage, based on memories of previous public-speaking disasters from yourdistant past. Whenever you think about the coming talk, you envision yourselfstanding there stammering and losing your train of thought. Your body begins torespond as if that future event is unfolding now; your shoulders tense, yourheart races, and you perspire heavily. As you anticipate that dreaded day, youcause your body to already be living in that stressful reality.Caught up in and obsessed with the possibility of failing again, you are sointent on that expected reality that you can’t concentrate on anything else.Your mind and body are polarized, moving from the past to the future and backagain. As a result, you deny yourself the novelty of a wonderful future outcome.As a more universal example of living in a predictable future, let’s say thatfor many years you wake up to each new day, only to slide automatically into thesame old set of unconscious actions. The body is so used to anticipatingperforming your daily behaviors that it goes almost mechanically from one taskto the next. There’s feeding the dog, brushing your teeth, putting on yourclothes, making tea, taking the garbage out, getting the mail … you get theidea. Although you may wake up with a thought to do something different, somehowyou find yourself doing those same-old, same-old things as if you are just alongfor the ride.After you have memorized these types of actions for a decade or two, your bodyhas been trained to continuously “look forward” to doing these things. In fact,it’s been subconsciously programmed to live in the future and thus allow you togo to sleep behind the wheel … we could even say that you’re no longer evendriving the car. Now your body cannot exist in the present moment. It is primedto control you by running a host of unconscious programs while you sit back andallow it to head toward some humdrum, known destiny.Overcoming your nearly automatic habits, and no longer anticipating the future,requires the ability to live greater than time. (More on that to come.)Living in the Past, Which Is Your FutureHere’s another example that demonstrates how familiar emotions create acorresponding future. You are invited to a co-worker’s 4th of July barbecue.Everyone from your department is expected to attend. You don’t like the host.He’s always number one, and he doesn’t mind letting everyone know it.Every time he’s hosted an event before, you’ve wound up having a miserable time,with this guy pushing every single one of your buttons. As you’re driving to hisplace now, all you can think about is how at the last party, he interruptedeveryone’s meal so he could present his wife with a new BMW. You’re certain, asyou’ve told your partner the whole week leading up to the cookout, that this isgoing to be one miserable day. And it becomes exactly that. You run a stop signand get a ticket. One of your co-workers spills a beer on your pants and shirt.The hamburger that you requested be done medium-well comes to you barely beyondraw.Given your attitude (your state of being) going in, how could you have expectedthings to turn out any other way? You woke up anticipating that this day wasslated to be a horror show, and it turned out that way. You alternated betweenobsessing about an unwanted future (anticipating what would come next) andliving in the past (comparing stimuli you were receiving to what you receivedpreviously), so you created more of the same.If you start keeping track of your thoughts and write them down, you’ll findthat most of the time, you are either thinking ahead or looking back.Live Your Desired New Future in the Precious PresentSo here’s another of those big questions: If you know that by staying presentand severing or pruning your connections with the past, you can have access toall the possible outcomes in the quantum field, why would you choose to live inthe past and keep creating the same future for yourself? Why wouldn’t you dowhat is already in your power to do—to mentally alter the physical makeup ofyour brain and body so that you can be changed ahead of any actual desiredexperience? Why wouldn’t you opt for living in the future of your choice—now,ahead of time?Instead of obsessing about some traumatic or stressful event that you fear is inyour future, based on your experience of the past, obsess about a new, desiredexperience that you haven’t yet embraced emotionally. Allow yourself to live inthat potential new future now, to the extent that your body begins to accept orbelieve that you’re experiencing the elevated emotions of that new futureoutcome in the present moment. (You’re going to learn how to do this.)Remember when I said that my daughter needed to live her present life like she’dalready had the experiences of the great summer in Italy? By doing that, she wasbroadcasting into the quantum field that the event had already physicallyoccurred.The greatest people in the world have demonstrated this, thousands of so-calledordinary people have done it, and you can as well. You have all the neurologicalmachinery to transcend time, to make this a skill. What some might callmiracles, I describe as cases of individuals working toward changing their stateof being, so that their bodies and minds are no longer merely a record of theirpast but become active partners, taking steps to a new and better future.Transcending the Big Three: Peak Experiencesand Ordinary Altered States of ConsciousnessAt this point, you understand that the main obstacle to breaking the habit ofbeing yourself is thinking and feeling equal to your environment, your body, andtime. Obviously, then, learning to think and feel (be) greater than the “BigThree” is your first goal as you prepare for the meditation process you willlearn in this book.I’d bet that at some point in your life (perhaps even frequently) you’ve alreadybeen able to think greater than your environment, your body, and time. Thesemoments when you transcend the Big Three are what some people call being “in theflow.” There are a number of ways to describe what happens when oursurroundings, our bodies, and our sense of time’s passage disappear and we are“lost” to the world. In speaking to groups across the globe, I’ve asked audiencemembers to describe creative moments when they were so consumed by what theywere doing, or were so relaxed and at ease, that they seemed to enter an alteredstate of consciousness.These experiences generally fall into two categories. The first of these are theso-called peak experiences, what we think of as transcendent moments, when weattain a state of being that we associate with monks and mystics. Compared tothose highly spiritual events, the others may be more mundane, ordinary, andprosaic—but that doesn’t mean that they are any less important.These ordinary moments happened to me many times (although not as often as Iwould like) while in the process of writing this book. When I first sit down towrite, I often have many other things on my mind—my busy travel schedule, mypatients, my kids, my staff, how hungry/sleepy/happy I am. On good days, whenthe words seem to flow out of me, it is as though my hands and my keyboard arean extension of my mind. I’m not consciously aware of my fingers moving or myback resting against the chair. The trees swaying in the breeze outside myoffice disappear, that bit of stiffness in my neck no longer nudges for myattention, and I am completely focused on and absorbed by the words on mycomputer screen. At some point, I realize that an hour or more has gone by inwhat seemed an instant.This kind of thing has likely happened to you—perhaps while you were driving,watching a movie, enjoying a dinner with good company, reading, knitting,practicing piano, or simply sitting in a quiet spot in nature.I don’t know about you, but I often feel amazingly refreshed after experiencingone of those moments when my environment, my body, and time seemed to disappear.They don’t always happen when I’m writing, but after completing my second book,I find that they occur with greater frequency. With practice, I’ve been able totake control so that these experiences of being in the flow are not asaccidental or serendipitous as they were at first.Overcoming the Big Three to facilitate the occurrence of such moments isessential for losing your mind and creating a new one.img [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER FIVE [toc.html#ch05]image [images/line.jpg]SURVIVAL VS. CREATION [toc.html#ch05]In the last chapter, I purposely used the example of my writing to illustrate mypoint about transcending the Big Three, because when you write, you are creatingwords (whether on the physical page or in a digital document). The samecreativity is operating when you paint, play a musical instrument, turn wood ona lathe, or engage in any other activity that has the effect of breaking thebonds that the Big Three hold over you.Why is it so hard to live in these creative moments? If we focus on an unwantedpast or a dreaded future, that means that we live mostly in stress—in survivalmode. Whether we’re obsessing over our health (the survival of the body), payingour mortgage (the survival need for shelter from our external environment), ornot having enough time to do what we need to do to survive, most of us are muchmore familiar with the addictive state of mind we’ll call “survival” than we arewith living as creators.In my first book, I went into great detail about the difference between livingin creation versus living in survival. So for a fuller explanation of thisdifference, you may want to read Chapters 8 through 11 in Evolve Your Brain. Inthe pages that follow, I’m going to briefly outline the difference between thetwo.img [images/logo1.jpg]Think of life in survival mode by picturing an animal, such as a deercontentedly grazing in the forest. Let’s assume that it is in homeostasis, inperfect balance. But if it perceives some danger in the outside world—say, apredator—its fight-or-flight nervous system gets turned on. This sympatheticnervous system is part of the autonomic nervous system, which maintains thebody’s automatic functions such as digestion, temperature regulation,blood-sugar levels, and the like. To prepare the animal to deal with theemergency it has detected, the body is chemically altered—the sympatheticnervous system automatically activates the adrenal glands to mobilize enormousamounts of energy. If the deer is chased by a pack of coyotes, it utilizes thatenergy to flee. If it is nimble enough to get away unharmed, then perhaps after15 to 20 minutes when the threat is no longer present, the animal resumesgrazing, its internal balance restored.We humans have the same system in place. When we perceive danger, oursympathetic nervous system is turned on, energy is mobilized, and so on, in muchthe same way as the deer. During early human history, this wonderfully adaptiveresponse helped us confront threats from predators and other risks to oursurvival. Those animal qualities served us well for our evolution as a species.Thought Alone Can Trigger the Human Stress Response—and Keep It GoingUnfortunately, there are several differences between Homo sapiens and ourplanetary cohabitants in the animal kingdom that don’t serve us as well. Everytime we knock the body out of chemical balance, that’s called “stress.” Thestress response is how the body innately responds when it’s knocked out ofbalance, and what it does to return back to equilibrium. Whether we see a lionin the Serengeti, bump into our not-so-friendly ex at the grocery store, orfreak out in freeway traffic because we’re late for a meeting, we turn on thestress response because we are reacting to our external environment.Unlike animals, we have the ability to turn on the fight-or-flight response bythought alone. And that thought doesn’t have to be about anything in our presentcircumstances. We can turn on that response in anticipation of some futureevent. Even more disadvantageous, we can produce the same stress response byrevisiting an unhappy memory that is stitched in the fabric of our gray matter.So either we anticipate stress-response-producing experiences or we recollectthem; our bodies are either existing in the future or in the past. To ourdetriment, we turn short-term stressful situations into long-term ones.On the other hand, as far as we can tell, animals don’t have the ability (orshould I say disability) to turn on the stress response so frequently and soeasily that they can’t turn it off. That deer, back to happily grazing, isn’tconsumed with thoughts about what just happened a few minutes ago, let alone thetime a coyote chased it two months ago. This kind of repetitive stress isharmful to us, because no organism was designed with a mechanism to deal withnegative effects on the body when the stress response is turned on with greatfrequency and for long duration. In other words, no creature can avoid theconsequences of living in long-term emergency situations. When we turn on thestress response and can’t turn it off, we’re headed for some type of breakdownin the body.Let’s say you keep turning on the fight-or-flight system due to some threateningcircumstance in your life (real or imagined). As your racing heart pumpsenormous amounts of blood to your extremities and your body is knocked out ofhomeostasis, you’re becoming prepared by the nervous system to run or fight. Butlet’s face it: you can’t flee to the Bahamas, nor can you throttle your fellowemployee—that would be primitive. So as a consequence, you condition your heartto race all the time, and you may be headed for high blood pressure,arrhythmias, and so on.And what’s in store when you keep mobilizing all that energy for some emergencysituation? If you’re putting the bulk of your energy toward some issue in yourexternal environment, there will be little left for your body’s internalenvironment. Your immune system, which monitors your inner world, can’t keep upwith the lack of energy for growth and repair. Therefore, you get sick, whetherit be from a cold, cancer, or rheumatoid arthritis. (All are immune-mediatedconditions.)When you think about it, the real difference between animals and ourselves isthat although we both experience stress, humans reexperience and“pre-experience” traumatic situations. What is so harmful about having ourstress response triggered by pressures from the past, present, and future? Whenwe get knocked out of chemical balance so often, eventually that out-of-balancestate becomes the norm. As a result, we are destined to live out our geneticdestiny, and in most cases that means suffering from some illness.The reason is clear: The domino effect from the cascade of hormones and otherchemicals we release in response to stress can dysregulate some of our genes,and that may create disease. In other words, repeated stress pushes the geneticbuttons that cause us to begin to head toward our genetic destiny. So what wasonce very adaptive behavior and a beneficial biochemical response (fight orflight) has become a highly maladaptive and harmful set of circumstances.For instance, when a lion was chasing your ancestors, the stress response wasdoing what it was designed to do—protect them from their outer environment.That’s adaptive. But if, for days on end, you fret about your promotion,overfocus on your presentation to upper management, or worry about your motherbeing in the hospital, these situations create the same chemicals as though youwere being chased by a lion.Now, that’s maladaptive. You’re staying too long in emergency mode.Fight-or-flight is using up the energy your internal environment needs. Yourbody is stealing this vital energy from your immune, digestive, and endocrinesystems, among others, and directing it to the muscles that you’d use to fight apredator or run from danger. But in your situation, that’s only working againstyou.From a psychological perspective, overproduction of stress hormones creates thehuman emotions of anger, fear, envy, and hatred; incites feelings of aggression,frustration, anxiety, and insecurity; and causes us to experience pain,suffering, sadness, hopelessness, and depression. Most people spend the majorityof their time preoccupied with negative thoughts and feelings. Is it likely thatmost of the things that are happening in our present circumstances are negative?Obviously not. Negativity runs so high because we are either living inanticipation of stress or re-experiencing it through a memory, so most of ourthoughts and feelings are driven by those strong hormones of stress andsurvival.When our stress response is triggered, we focus on three things, and they are ofhighest importance: * The body. (It must be taken care of.) * The environment. (Where can I go to escape this threat?) * Time. (How much of it do I have to use in order to evade this threat?)Living in survival is the reason why we humans are so dominated by the BigThree. The stress response and the hormones that it triggers force us to focuson (and obsess about) the body, the environment, and time. As a result, we beginto define our “self” within the confines of the physical realm; we become lessspiritual, less conscious, less aware, and less mindful.Put another way, we grow to be “materialists”—that is, habitually consumed bythoughts of things in the external environment. Our identity becomes wrapped upin our bodies. We are absorbed by the outer world because that is what thosechemicals force us to pay attention to—things we own, people we know, places wehave to go, problems we face, hairstyles we dislike, our body parts, our weight,our looks in comparison to others, how much time we have or don’t have … you getthe picture. And we remember who we are based primarily on what we know and thethings we do.Living in survival causes us to focus on the .00001 percent instead of the99.99999 percent of reality.Survival: Living as a “Somebody”Most of us embrace the traditional notion of ourselves as a “somebody.” But whowe really are has nothing to do with the Big Three. Who we are is aconsciousness connected to a quantum field of intelligence.When we become this somebody, this materialistic physical self living insurvival, we forget who we truly are. We become disconnected and feel separatefrom the universal field of intelligence. The more we live impacted by stresshormones, the more their chemical rush becomes our identity.If we fancy ourselves solely physical beings, we limit ourselves to perceivingonly with our physical senses. The more we use our senses to define our reality,the more we allow our senses to determine our reality. We slip into thatNewtonian mode of thinking, which locks us into trying to predict the futurebased on some past experience. If you recall, the Newtonian model of reality isall about predicting an outcome. Now we are trying to control our realityinstead of surrendering to something greater. All we’re doing is trying tosurvive.If the quantum model of reality ultimately defines everything as energy, why dowe experience ourselves more as physical beings than as beings of energy? Wecould say that the survival-oriented emotions (emotions are energy in motion)are lower-frequency or lower-energy emotions. They vibrate at a slowerwavelength and therefore ground us into being physical. We become denser,heavier, and more corporeal, because that energy causes us to vibrate moreslowly. The body quite literally becomes composed of more mass and less energy …more matter, less mind.1 [endnotes.html#ch05_en1]img [images/p103.jpg]Figure 5A. The higher-frequency waves at the top are vibrating faster andtherefore are closer to the vibratory rate of energy and less to that of matter.Moving down the scale, you can see that the slower the wavelength, the more“material” the energy becomes. Thus, the survival emotions ground us to be morelike matter and less like energy. Emotions such as anger, harted, suffering,shame, guilt, judgment, and lust make us feel more physical, because they carrya frequency that is slower and more like that of physical objects. However, themore elevated emotions such as love, joy, and gratitude are higher in frequency.As a result, they are more energy-like and less physical/materialSo it might make sense that if we inhibit our more primitive survival emotionsand begin to break our addiction to them, our energy will be higher infrequency, and less likely to root us to the body. In a way, we can liberateenergy from the body, when the body has “become” the mind, into the quantumfield. As our emotions become more elevated, we will naturally ascend to ahigher level of consciousness, closer to Source … and feel more connected touniversal intelligence.Addicted to Being a SomebodyWhen the stress response is turned on, whether in response to a real orconjured-up threat, a powerful cascade of chemicals rushes into our system andgives us a strong jolt of energy, momentarily “waking up” our bodies and certainparts of the brain to put all of our attention on the Big Three. This is veryaddictive to us because it’s like drinking a triple espresso—we get turned “on”for a few moments.In time, we unconsciously become addicted to our problems, our unfavorablecircumstances, or our unhealthy relationships. We keep these situations in ourlives to feed our addiction to survival-oriented emotions, so that we canremember who we think we are as a somebody. We just love the rush of energy weget from our troubles!Moreover, we also associate this emotional high with every person, thing, place,and experience in our outer world that is known and familiar. We become addictedto these elements in our environment as well; we embrace our environment as ouridentity.If you agree that we can turn on the stress response just by thinking, then itstands to reason that we can get the same rush of addictive stress chemicals asif we were being chased by a predator. As a consequence, we become addicted toour very thoughts; they begin to give us an unconscious adrenaline high, and wefind it very hard to think differently. To think greater than how we feel or tothink outside of the proverbial box becomes just too uncomfortable. The momentwe begin to deny ourselves the substance we are addicted to—in this case, thefamiliar thoughts and feelings associated with our emotional addiction—there arecravings, withdrawal pains, and a host of inner subvocalizations urging us notto change. And so we remain chained to our familiar reality.Thus, our thoughts and feelings, which are predominantly self-limiting, hook usback to all the problems, conditions, stressors, and bad choices that producedthe fight-or-flight effect in the first place. We keep all these negativestimuli around us so that we can produce the stress response, because thataddiction reinforces the idea of who we are, only serving to reaffirm our ownpersonal identity. Simply put, most of us are addicted to the problems andconditions of our lives that produce stress. No matter whether we’re in a badjob or a bad relationship, we hold our troubles close to us because they helpreinforce who we are as a somebody; they feed our addictions to low-frequencyemotions.Most harmful of all, we live in fear that if those problems were taken away, wewouldn’t know what to think and how to feel, and we wouldn’t get to experiencethe rush of energy that causes us to remember who we are. For most of us, Godforbid we not be a somebody. How awful would it be to be a “nobody,” to not havean identity?The Selfish SelfAs you can see, what we identify as our self exists within the context of ourcollective emotional association with our thoughts and feelings, our problems,and all those elements of the Big Three. Is it any wonder that people find it sohard to go within and leave this self-produced reality behind? How would we knowwho we are if it weren’t for our environment, our bodies, and time? That’s whywe are so dependent upon the external world. We limit ourselves to using oursenses to define and cultivate emotions, so that we can receive thephysiological feedback that reaffirms our own personal addictions. We do allthis to feel human.When our survival response is way out of proportion to what is happening in ourouter world, that excess of stress-response hormones causes us to become fixatedwithin the parameters of self. So we become overly selfish. We obsess about ourbodies or a particular aspect of our environment, and we live enslaved to time.We’re trapped in this particular reality, and we feel powerless to change, tobreak the habit of being ourselves.These excessive survival emotions tip the scales of a healthy ego (the self weconsciously refer to when we say “I”). When the ego is in check, its natural jobis to make sure we are protected and safe in the outer world. As an example, theego makes sure we stay far away from a bonfire or a few steps away from thecliff’s edge. When the ego is balanced, its natural instinct isself-preservation. There’s a healthy balance between its needs and those ofothers, its attention to itself and to others.When we’re in survival mode in an emergency situation, it makes sense that theself should take priority. But when chronic, long-term stress chemicals push thebody and brain out of balance, the ego becomes overfocused on survival and putsthe self first, to the exclusion of anything else—we’re selfish all the time.Thus, we become self-indulgent, self-centered, and self-important, full ofself-pity and self-loathing. When the ego is under constant stress, it’s got a“me first” priority.Under those conditions, the ego is primarily concerned with predicting everyoutcome of every situation, because it is overfocused on the outer world andfeels completely separated from the 99.99999 percent of reality. In fact, themore we define reality through our senses, the more this reality becomes ourlaw. And material reality as law is the very opposite of the quantum law.Whatever we place our awareness on is our reality. Consequently, if ourattention is focused on the body and our physical realm, and if we become lockedinto a particular line of linear time, then this becomes our reality.To forget about the people we know, the problems we have, the things we own, andthe places we go; to lose track of time; to go beyond the body and its need tofeed its habituations; to give up the high from emotionally familiar experiencesthat reaffirm the identity; to detach from trying to predict a future conditionor review a past memory; to lay down the selfish ego that is only concerned withits needs; to think or dream greater than how we feel, and crave theunknown—this is the beginning of freedom from our present lives.If Our Thoughts Can Make Us Sick,Can They Make Us Well?Let’s go one step further. I explained earlier that we can turn on the stressresponse by thought alone. I also mentioned the scientific fact that thechemicals associated with stress pull the genetic trigger by creating a veryharsh environment outside of our cells and thus creating disease. So by purereason, our thoughts can actually make us sick. If our thoughts can make ussick, might they also make us well?Let’s say that a person had some experiences within a short time frame thatcaused him to feel resentful. As a result of his unconscious reactions to thoseoccurrences, he held on to his bitterness. Chemicals corresponding to thisemotion flooded his cells. Over weeks, his emotion turned into a mood, whichcontinued for months and changed into a temperament, which was sustained foryears and formed a strong personality trait called resentment. In fact, hememorized this emotion so well that the body knew resentment better than theconscious mind, because he remained in a cycle of thinking and feeling, feelingand thinking, that way for years.Based on what you learned about emotions as the chemical signature of anexperience, wouldn’t you agree that as long as this person clings to resentment,his body will react as though it is still experiencing the long-ago events thatfirst caused him to embrace this emotion? Moreover, if the body’s reaction tothose chemicals of resentment disrupted the function of certain genes, and thissustained reaction kept signaling the same genes to respond in the same way,might the body eventually develop a physical condition such as cancer?If so, is it possible that once he unmemorized the emotion of continuousresentment—by no longer thinking the thoughts that created the feelings ofresentment, and vice versa—his body (as the unconscious mind) would be free fromthat emotional enslavement? In time, would he stop signaling the genes the sameway?And finally, let’s say he began thinking and feeling in new ways, to such adegree that he invented a new ideal of himself related to a new personality. Ashe moved into a new state of being, might he signal his genes in beneficial waysand condition the body into an elevated emotional state, ahead of the actualexperience of good health? Could he do this to the extent that the body wouldbegin to change by thought alone?What I just described in simple terms happened to a student in one of myseminars, who overcame cancer.img [images/logo1.jpg]Bill, 57, was a roofing contractor. A lesion had appeared on his face, and adermatologist diagnosed malignant melanoma. Although Bill underwent surgery,radiation, and chemotherapy, the cancer recurred in his neck, then his side, andfinally his calf. Each time, he underwent a similar course of treatment.Naturally, Bill experienced “Why me?” moments. He understood that his excessivesun exposure was a risk factor, but he knew others who had been similarlyexposed and didn’t develop cancer. He fixated on that unfairness.After treatment for the same cancer on his left flank, Bill pondered whether hisown thoughts, emotions, and behaviors had contributed to his condition. In amoment of self-reflection, he realized that for more than 30 years, he had beenstuck in resentment, thinking and feeling that he always had to give up what hewanted for the sake of others.For example, he had wanted to become a professional musician after high school.But when an injury left his father unable to work, Bill had to join his family’sroofing company. He habitually reexperienced his feelings upon being told he hadto give up his aspirations, to the extent that his body still lived in thatpast. This also set up a pattern of dreams deferred. Whenever something didn’tgo his way, such as the housing market collapsing just after he expanded thebusiness, he always found someone or something to blame.Bill had so memorized the emotional response pattern of bitterness that itdominated his personality and became an unconscious program. His state of beinghad signaled the same genes for so long that they had created the disease thatnow afflicted him.No longer could Bill allow his environment to control him: the people, places,and influences in his life had always dictated how he thought, felt, andbehaved. He sensed that to break the bonds with his old self and reinvent a newone, he would have to leave his familiar environment. So for two weeks in Baja,Mexico, he retreated from his familiar life.The first five mornings, Bill contemplated how he thought when he feltresentment. He became a quantum observer of his thoughts and feelings; he becameconscious of his unconscious mind. Next, he paid attention to his previouslyunconscious behaviors and actions. He decided to halt any thought, behavior, oremotion that was unloving toward himself.After the first week of this vigilance, Bill felt free, because he had liberatedhis body from its emotional addiction to resentment. By inhibiting the familiarthoughts and feelings that had driven his behaviors, in a sense he impeded thesignals of the survival emotions from conditioning his body to the same mind.His body then released energy, which was available to use to design a newdestiny for himself.For the next week, Bill became so uplifted that he thought about the new self hewanted to be, and how he would respond to the people, places, and influencesthat previously controlled him. For instance, he decided that whenever his wifeand kids expressed a wish or need, he would respond with kindness and generosityinstead of making them feel like a burden. In short, he focused on how he wantedto think, act, and feel when presented with situations that had challenged himin the past. He was creating a new personality, a new mind, and a new state ofbeing.Bill began to put into practice what he’d placed in his mind while sitting onthat Baja beach. Shortly after his return, he noticed that the tumor on his calfhad fallen off. In a week or so, when he went to his doctor, he was cancer free.He has remained that way.By firing his brain in new ways, Bill changed biologically and chemically fromhis previous self. As a result, he signaled new genes in new ways; and thosecancer cells couldn’t coexist with his new mind, new internal chemistry, and newself. Once trapped by the emotions of the past, he now lives in a new future.Creation: Living as a NobodyAt the end of the previous chapter, I briefly described what it is like to livein creative mode. Those are the moments of being fully engaged and in flow sothat the environment, the body, and time all seem immaterial and don’t invadeour conscious thoughts.Living in creation is living as a nobody. Ever notice that when you’re truly inthe midst of creating anything, you forget about yourself? You dissociate fromyour known world. You are no longer a somebody who associates your identity withcertain things you own, particular people you know, certain tasks you do, anddifferent places you lived at specific times. You could say that when you are ina creative state, you forget about the habit of being you. You lay down yourselfish ego and become self-less.You have moved beyond time and space and become pure, immaterial awareness. Onceyou’re no longer connected to a body; no longer focused on people, places, orthings in your external environment; and beyond linear time, you’re entering thedoor of the quantum field. You cannot enter as a somebody, you must do so as anobody. You have to leave the self-centered ego at the door and enter the realmof consciousness as pure consciousness. And as I said in Chapter 1, in order tochange your body (to foster better health), something in your externalcircumstances (a new job or relationship, perhaps), or your timeline (toward apossible future reality), you have to become no body, no thing, no time.Thus, here is the grand hint: to change any aspect of your life (body,environment, or time), you must transcend it. You must leave behind the BigThree in order to control the Big Three.The Frontal Lobe: Domain of Creation and ChangeWhen we are in creation, we are activating the brain’s creative center, thefrontal lobe (part of the forebrain and comprising the prefrontal cortex). Thisis the newest, most evolved part of our human nervous system and the mostadaptable part of the brain. It tends to be the creative center of who we are,and the brain’s CEO or decision-making apparatus. The frontal lobe is the seatof our attention, focused concentration, awareness, observation, andconsciousness. It is where we speculate on possibilities, demonstrate firmintention, make conscious decisions, control impulsive and emotional behaviors,and learn new things.For the sake of our understanding, the frontal lobe performs three essentialfunctions. These will all come into play as you learn and practice the how-tomeditative steps for breaking the habit of being yourself in Part III of thisbook.1. Metacognition: Becoming Self-Aware to InhibitUnwanted States of Mind and BodyIf you want to create a new self, you first have to stop being the old self. Inthe process of creation, the first function of the frontal lobe is to becomeself-aware.Because we have metacognitive capabilities—the power to observe our own thoughtsand self—we can decide how we no longer want to be … to think, act, and feel.This ability to self-reflect allows us to scrutinize ourselves and then make aplan to modify our behaviors so we can produce more enlightened or desirableoutcomes.2 [endnotes.html#ch05_en2]Your attention is where you place your energy. To use attention to empower yourlife, you will have to examine what you’ve already created. This is where youbegin to “know thyself.” You look at your beliefs about life, yourself, andothers. You are what you are, you are where you are, and you are who you arebecause of what you believe about yourself. Your beliefs are the thoughts youkeep consciously or unconsciously accepting as the law in your life. Whether youare aware of them or not, they still affect your reality.So if you truly want a new personal reality, start observing all aspects of yourpresent personality. Since they primarily operate below the level of consciousawareness, much like automatic software programs, you’ll have to go within andlook at these elements you probably haven’t been aware of before. Given thatyour personality comprises how you think, act, and feel, you must pay attentionto your unconscious thoughts, reflexive behaviors, and automatic emotionalreactions—put them under observation to determine if they are true and whetheryou want to continue to endorse them with your energy.To become familiar with your unconscious states of mind and body takes an act ofwill, intention, and heightened awareness. If you become more aware, you willbecome more attentive. If you become more attentive, you will be more conscious.If you grow to be more conscious, you will notice more. If you notice more, youhave a greater ability to observe self and others, both inner and outer elementsof your reality. Ultimately, the more you observe, the more you awaken from thestate of the unconscious mind into conscious awareness.The purpose of becoming self-aware is so that you no longer allow any thought,action, or emotion you don’t want to experience to pass by your awareness. Thus,in time, your ability to consciously inhibit those states of being will stop thesame firing and wiring of the old neural networks that are related to the oldpersonality. And as a result of no longer re-creating the same mind on a dailybasis, you prune away the hardware that is related to the old self. In addition,by interrupting the feelings that are associated with those thoughts, you are nolonger signaling genes in the same way. You are stopping the body fromreaffirming itself as the same mind. This process is whereby you quite simplybegin to “lose your mind.”So as you develop the skill of becoming familiar with all aspects of your oldself, you will ultimately become more conscious. Your goal here is to unlearnwho you used to be, so that you can free up energy to create a new life, a newpersonality. You can’t create a new personal reality as the same personality.You have to become someone else. Metacognition is your first task in moving fromyour past to creating a new future.2. Creating a New Mind to Think aboutNew Ways of BeingThe second function of the frontal lobe is to create a new mind—to break out ofthe neural networks produced by the ways that your brain has been firing foryears on end, and influence it to rewire in new ways.When we set aside time and private space to think about a new way of being, thatis when the frontal lobe engages in creation. We can imagine fresh possibilitiesand ask ourselves important questions about what we really want, how and who wewant to be, and what we want to change about ourselves and our circumstances.Because the frontal lobe has connections to all other parts of the brain, it isable to scan across all the neural circuits to seamlessly piece together storedbits of information in the form of networks of knowledge and experience. Then itpicks and chooses among those neural circuits, combining them in a variety ofways to create a new mind. In doing that, it creates a model or internalrepresentation that we see as a picture of our intended result. It makes sense,then, that the more knowledge we have, the greater the variety of neuralnetworks we’ve wired, and the more capable we are of dreaming of more complexand detailed models.To initiate this step of creation, it is always good to move into a state ofwonder, contemplation, possibility, reflection, or speculation by askingyourself some important questions. Open-ended inquiries are the most provocativeapproach to producing a fluent stream of consciousness: * What would it be like to … ? * What is a better way to be … ? * What if I was this person, living in this reality? * Who in history do I admire, and what were his/her admirable traits?The answers that come will naturally form a new mind, because as you sincerelyrespond to them, your brain will begin to work in new ways. By beginning tomentally rehearse new ways of being, you start rewiring yourself neurologicallyto a new mind—and the more you can “re-mind” yourself, the more you’ll changeyour brain and your life.Whether you want to be wealthy or a better parent—or a great wizard, for thatmatter—it might not be a bad idea to fill your brain with knowledge on yourchosen subject, so you have more building blocks to make a new model of thereality you want to embrace. Every time you acquire information, you’re addingnew synaptic connections that will serve as the raw materials to break thepattern of your brain firing the same way. The more you learn, the more ammo youhave to unseat the old personality.img [images/p114.jpg]Figure 5B. When the frontal lobe is working in creative mode, it looks out overthe landscape of the entire brain and gathers all of the brain’s information tocreate a new mind. If compassion is the new state of being that you want tocreate, then once you ask yourself what it would be like to be compassionate,the frontal lobe would naturally combine different neural networks together innew ways to create a new model or vision. It might take stored information frombooks you read, DVDs you saw, personal experiences, and so forth to make thebrain work in new ways. Once the new mind is in place, you see a picture,hologram, or vision of what compassion means to you.3. Making Thought More Real Than Anything ElseDuring the creative process, the frontal lobe’s third vital role is to makethought more real than anything else. (Stay tuned for the how-to in Part III.)When we’re in a creative state, the frontal lobe becomes highly activated andlowers the volume on the circuits in the rest of the brain so that little elseis being processed but a single-minded thought.3 [endnotes.html#ch05_en3] Sincethe frontal lobe is the executive that mediates the rest of the brain, it canmonitor all of the “geography.” So it lowers the volume on the sensory centers(responsible for “feeling” the body), motor centers (responsible for moving thebody), association centers (where our identity exists), and the circuits thatprocess time … in order to quiet them all down. With very little neuralactivity, we could say that there is no mind to process sensory input (rememberthat mind is the brain in action), no mind to activate movement within theenvironment, and no mind to associate activities with time; then we have nobody, we have become “no thing,” we are no time. We are, in that moment, pureconsciousness. With the noise shut off in those areas of the brain, the state ofcreativity is one in which there is no ego or self as we have known it.When you are in creation mode, the frontal lobe is in control. It becomes soengaged that your thoughts become your reality and your experience. Whateveryou’re thinking about in those moments is all there is for the frontal lobe toprocess. As it “lowers the volume” from other areas of the brain, it shuts outdistractions. The inner world of thought becomes as real as the outer world ofreality. Your thoughts are captured neurologically and branded into your brain’sarchitecture as an experience.If you effectively execute the creative process, this experience produces anemotion, as you know, and you begin to feel like that event is actuallyhappening to you in the present. You are one with the thoughts and feelingsassociated with your desired reality. You are now in a new state of being. Youcould say that in that moment, you are now rewriting the subconscious programsby reconditioning the body to a new mind.img [images/p116.jpg]Figure 5C. When the thoght that you are attending to becomes the experience, thefrontal lobe quiets down the rest of the brain so that nothing else is beingprocessed but that single-minded thought. You become still, you no longer feelyour body, you no longer perceive time and space, and you forget about yourself.Lose Your Mind, Liberate Your EnergyIn the act of creation, when we become that nobody or no thing in no time, we nolonger create our customary chemical signature, because we are not the sameidentity; we don’t think and feel in the same way. Those neural networks oursurvival thinking had wired are turned off, and the personality that wasaddicted to continually signaling the body to produce stress hormones is … gone.In short, the emotional self that lived in survival mode is no longerfunctioning. The moment that happens, our former identity, the “state of being”bound by survival-based thinking and feeling, is no more. Since we are no longer“being” the same being, emotional energy that had been bound to the body is nowfree to move.So where does the energy go that once fed that emotional self? It has to gosomewhere, so it moves to a new place. That energy in the form of emotion movesup the body from the hormonal centers to the heart area (on its way to thebrain) … and all of a sudden we feel great, joyful, expanded. We fall in lovewith our creation. That’s when we experience our natural state of being. Once westop energizing that emotional self powered by the stress response, we havemoved from being selfish to selfless.4 [endnotes.html#ch05_en4]With that old energy transmuted into a higher-frequency emotion, the body isliberated from its emotional bondage. We are lifted above the horizon to beholda whole new landscape. No longer perceiving reality through the lenses of thosepast survival emotions, we see new possibilities. We are now quantum observersof a new destiny. And that release heals the body and frees the mind.img [images/logo1.jpg]Let’s revisit the chart of energy and frequencies from the survival emotions tothe elevated emotions (see Figure 5A [chap05.html#fig5a]). When anger or shameor lust are released from the body, they will be transmuted into joy, love, orgratitude. On this journey to broadcasting higher energy, the body (which weconditioned to be the mind) becomes less “of the mind” and becomes more coherentenergy; the matter that makes up the body expresses a higher vibratory rate, andwe feel more connected to something greater. In short, we are demonstrating moreof our divine nature.When you’re living in survival, you’re trying to control or force an outcome;that’s what the ego does. When you’re living in the elevated emotion ofcreation, you feel so lifted that you would never try to analyze how or when achosen destiny will arrive. You trust that it will happen because you havealready experienced it in mind and body—in thought and feeling. You know that itwill, because you feel connected to something greater. You are in a state ofgratitude because you feel like it’s already happened.You may not know all the specifics of your desired outcome—when it will takeplace, where, and under what circumstances—but you trust in a future that youcan’t see or otherwise perceive with your senses. To you it has already occurredin no space, no time, no place, from which all things material spring forth. Youare in a state of knowingness; you can relax into the present and no longer livein survival.To anticipate or analyze when, where, or how the event will occur would onlycause you to return to your old identity. You are in such joy that it’simpossible to try to figure it out; that’s only what human beings do when theyare living in limited states of survival.As you linger in this creative state where you are no longer your identity, thenerve cells that once fired together to form that old self are no longer wiringtogether. That’s when the old personality is being biologically dismantled.Those feelings connected to that identity, which conditioned the body to thesame mind, are no longer signaling the same genes in the same ways. And the moreyou overcome your ego, the more the physical evidence of the old personality ischanged. The old you is gone.img [images/p119.jpg]Figure 5D. Survival mode versus creation mode.By completing Part I of this book, you have intentionally acquired a knowledgebase that will help you create your new self. Now let’s build on that base.We’ve covered a lot of possibilities: the concept that your subjective mind canaffect your objective world; your potential to change your brain and body bybecoming greater than your environment, your body, and time; and the prospectthat you can move out of the reactive, stressful mode of living in survival, asthough only the outer world is real, and enter the inner world of the creator.It is my hope that you can now view these possibilities as possible realities.If you can, then I invite you to continue on to Part II, where you will gainspecific information about the role of your brain and the meditative processthat will prepare you to create real and lasting change in your life.img [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]PART II [toc.html#pt02]image [images/logo2.jpg]YOUR BRAINANDMEDITATION [toc.html#pt02]image [images/logo2.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER SIX [toc.html#ch06]image [images/line.jpg]THREE BRAINS: THINKING TO DOING TO BEING [toc.html#ch06]It’s often useful to compare one’s brain to a computer, and it’s true that yoursalready has all the hardware you’ll need to change your “self” and your life.But do you know how best to use that hardware to install new software?Picture two computers with identical hardware and software—one in the hands of atech novice, and the other being used by an experienced computer operator. Thebeginner knows little about what kinds of things a computer can do, let alonehow to do them.The intention behind Part II, simply put, is to provide pertinent informationabout the brain so that when you, as its operator, begin to use the meditativeprocess to change your life, you will know what needs to happen in your brainand in your meditations, and why.Change Entails New Ways ofThinking, Doing, and BeingIf you know how to drive a car, then you’ve already experienced probably themost elementary example of thinking, doing, and being. At first, you had tothink about every action you took, and about all those rules of the road. Later,you became fairly proficient at driving, as long as you paid conscious attentionto what you were doing. Eventually, you were being a driver; your conscious mindslid over and became a passenger, and ever since, your subconscious mind hasprobably occupied the driver’s seat most of the time; driving has becomeautomatic and second nature to you. Much of what you learn is via thisprogression from thinking to doing to being, and three areas of the brainfacilitate this mode of learning.But did you know that you can also go directly from thinking to being—and it’slikely that you’ve already experienced this in your life? Through the meditationthat is at the heart of this book (this chapter will give you a prelude), youcan go from thinking about the ideal self you want to become, straight to beingthat new self. That is the key to quantum creating.Change all begins with thinking: we can immediately form new neurologicalconnections and circuits that reflect our new thoughts. And nothing gets thebrain more excited than when it’s learning—assimilating knowledge andexperiences. These are aphrodisiacs for the brain; it “fondles” every signal itreceives from our five senses. Every second, it processes billions of bits ofdata; it analyzes, examines, identifies, extrapolates, classifies, and filesinformation, which it can retrieve for us on an “as needed” basis. Truly, thehuman brain is this planet’s ultimate supercomputer.As you’ll recall, the basis for understanding how you can actually change yourmind is the concept of hardwiring—how neurons engage in long-term, habitualrelationships. I’ve talked about Hebbian learning, which states: “Nerve cellsthat fire together, wire together.” (Neuroscientists used to think that afterchildhood, brain structure was relatively immutable. But new findings revealthat many aspects of the brain and nervous system can change structurally andfunctionally—including learning, memory, and recovery from braindamage—throughout adulthood.)But the opposite is also true: “Nerve cells that no longer fire together, nolonger wire together.” If you don’t use it, you lose it. You can even focusconscious thought to disconnect or unwire unwanted connections. Thus, it ispossible to let go of some of the “stuff” you’ve been holding on to that colorsthe way you think, act, and feel. The rewired brain will no longer fireaccording to the circuitry of the past.The gift of neuroplasticity (the brain’s ability to rewire and create newcircuits at any age as a result of input from the environment and our consciousintentions) is that we can create a new level of mind. There’s a sort ofneurological “out with the old, in with the new,” a process that neuroscientistscall pruning and sprouting. It’s what I call unlearning and learning, and itcreates the opportunity for us to rise above our current limitations and to begreater than our conditioning or circumstances.In creating a new habit of being ourselves, we are essentially taking consciouscontrol over what had become an unconscious process of being. Instead of themind working toward one goal (I’m not going to be an angry person) and the bodyworking toward another (Let’s stay angry and keep bathing in those familiarchemicals), we want to unify the mind’s intent with the body’s responses. To dothis, we must create a new way of thinking, doing, and being.Given that to change our lives, we first have to change our thoughts andfeelings, then do something (change our actions or behaviors) to have a newexperience, which in turn produces a new feeling, and then we must memorize thatfeeling until we move into a state of being (when mind and body are one), atleast we’ve got a few things going for us. Along with the brain beingneuroplastic, we could say that we have more than one brain to work with. Ineffect, we have three of them.(For our purposes, this chapter will limit its focus to those functions of the“three brains” that relate specifically to breaking the habit of beingourselves. On a personal note, I find that studying what the brain and the othercomponents of the nervous system do for us is an endlessly fascinatingexploration. My first book, Evolve Your Brain, covered this topic in more detailthan would serve our purposes here; there are additional resources for study onmy website, www.drjoedispenza.com [http://www.drjoedispenza.com]; and of course,many other excellent publications and websites are available for those who wantto learn more about the brain, the mind, and the body.)img [images/p126.jpg]Figure 6A. The “first brain,” the neocortex or thinking brain (in white). The“second brain” is the limbic or emotional brain, responsible for creating,maintaining, and organizing chemicals in the body (in gray). The “third brain,”the cerebellum, is the seat of the subconscious mind (in charcoal).From Thinking to Doing: The Neocortex ProcessesKnowledge, Then Prompts Us to Live What We LearnedOur “thinking brain” is the neocortex, the brain’s walnut-like outer covering.Humanity’s newest, most advanced neurological hardware, the neocortex is theseat of the conscious mind, our identity, and other higher brain functions. (Thefrontal lobe, discussed in earlier chapters, is one of four parts of theneocortex.)Essentially, the neocortex is the brain’s architect or designer. It allows youto learn, remember, reason, analyze, plan, create, speculate on possibilities,invent, and communicate. Since this area is where you log sensory data such aswhat you see and hear, the neocortex plugs you into external reality.In general, the neocortex processes knowledge and experience. First, you gatherknowledge in the form of facts or semantic information (philosophical ortheoretical concepts or ideas that you learn intellectually), prompting theneocortex to add new synaptic connections and circuits.Second, once you decide to personalize or apply knowledge you have acquired—todemonstrate what you learned—you will invariably create a new experience. Thiscauses patterns of neurons called neural networks to form in the neocortex.These networks reinforce the circuitry of what you learned intellectually.If the neocortex had a motto, it might be: Knowledge is for the mind.Simply put, knowledge is the precursor to experience: Your neocortex isresponsible forprocessing ideas that you have not yet experienced, which existas a potential for you to embrace at some future time. As you entertain newthoughts, you begin to think about modifying your behavior so that you can dosomething differently when the opportunity presents itself, in order to have anew outcome. As you then alter your routine actions and typical behaviors,something different from the norm should happen, which will produce a new eventfor you to experience.From New Events to New Emotions: The Limbic BrainProduces Chemicals to Help Us Remember ExperiencesThe limbic brain (also known as the mammalian brain), located under theneocortex, is the most highly developed and specialized area of the brain inmammals other than humans, dolphins, and higher primates. Just think of thelimbic brain as the “chemical brain” or the “emotional brain.”When you’re in the midst of that new experience, and your senses send a rush ofcorresponding information from the external world to your neocortex, its neuralnetworks organize themselves to reflect the event. Thus, experience enriches thebrain even further than new knowledge.The moment those networks of neurons fire with a pattern specific to that newexperience, the emotional brain manufactures and releases chemicals in the formof peptides. This chemical cocktail has a specific signature that reflects theemotions you are experiencing in the moment. As you now know, emotions are theend products of experience; a new experience creates a new emotion (whichsignals new genes in new ways). Thus, emotions signal the body to record theevent chemically, and you begin to embody what you are learning.In the process, the limbic brain assists in forming long-term memories: you canremember any experience better because you can recall how you felt emotionallywhile the event was occurring. (The neocortex and limbic brain together enableus to form declarative memories, meaning that we can declare what we’ve learnedor experienced.1 [endnotes.html#ch06_en1] See Figure 6B [chap06.html#fig6b][1]for more information on declarative and nondeclarative memories.)You can see, then, how we are marked emotionally by highly charged experiences.All people who have been married can tell you where they were and what they weredoing when they or their beloved proposed. Perhaps they were eating a great mealon the patio of their favorite restaurant, feeling the balmy breezes of thatsummer night and enjoying the sunset while the strains of Mozart played softlyin the background, when their dinner partner got down on one knee and held out alittle black box.The combination of everything they were experiencing in that moment made themfeel very different from their normal self. The typical internal chemicalbalance that their identity self had memorized got knocked out of order by whatthey saw, heard, and felt. In a sense, they woke up from the familiar, routineenvironmental stimuli that typically bombard the brain and cause us to think andfeel in predictable ways. Novel events surprise us to the point that we becomemore aware in the present moment.If the limbic brain had a motto, it might be: Experience is for the body.If knowledge is for the mind, and experience is for the body, then when youapply knowledge and create a new experience, you teach the body what the mindhas intellectually learned. Knowledge without experience is merely philosophy;experience without knowledge is ignorance. There’s a progression that has totake place. You have to take knowledge and live it—embrace it emotionally.If you’re still with me as I’ve been discussing how to change your life, you’velearned about gaining knowledge, and then taking action to have a newexperience, which produces a new feeling. Next, you have to memorize thatfeeling and move what you’ve learned from the conscious mind to the subconsciousmind. You’ve already got the hardware to do that in the third brain area we’lldiscuss.From Thinking and Doing to Being: The CerebellumStores Habitual Thoughts, Attitudes, and BehaviorsDo you remember my talking about the common experience when we can’t consciouslyremember a phone number, ATM PIN, or lock combination, but we’ve practiced it sooften that the body knows better than the brain, and our fingers automaticallyget the job done? That may seem like a small thing. But when the body knowsequal to or better than the conscious mind, when you can repeat an experience atwill without much conscious effort, then you have memorized the action,behavior, attitude, or emotional reaction until it has become a skill or ahabit.When you reach this level of ability, you have moved into a state of being. Inthe process, you’ve activated the third brain area that plays a major role inchanging your life—the cerebellum, seat of the subconscious.The most active part of the brain, the cerebellum is located at the back of theskull. Think of it as the brain’s microprocessor and memory center. Every neuronin the cerebellum has the potential to connect with at least 200,000—and up to amillion—other cells, to process balance, coordination, awareness of the spatialrelation of body parts, and execution of controlled movements. The cerebellumstores certain types of simple actions and skills, along with hardwiredattitudes, emotional reactions, repeated actions, habits, conditioned behaviors,and unconscious reflexes and skills that we have mastered and memorized.Possessing amazing memory storage, it easily downloads various forms of learnedinformation into programmed states of mind and body.When you are in a state of being, you begin to memorize a new neurochemicalself. That’s when the cerebellum takes over, making that new state an implicitpart of your subconscious programming. The cerebellum is the site ofnondeclarative memories, meaning that you’ve done or practiced something so manytimes that it becomes second nature and you don’t have to think about it; it’sbecome so automatic that it’s hard to declare or describe how you do it. Whenthat happens, you will arrive at a point when happiness (or whatever attitude,behavior, skill, or trait you’ve been focusing on and rehearsing mentally orphysically) will become an innately memorized program of the new self.Let’s use a true-to-life example to take a practical look at how these threebrains take us from thinking to doing to being. First, we’ll see how throughconscious mental rehearsal, the thinking brain (neocortex) uses knowledge toactivate new circuits in new ways to make a new mind. Then, our thought createsan experience, and via the emotional (limbic) brain, that produces a newemotion. Our thinking and feeling brains condition the body to a new mind.Finally, if we reach the point where mind and body are working as one, thecerebellum enables us to memorize a new neurochemical self, and our new state ofbeing is now an innate program in our subconscious.A Real-Life Example of the Three Brains in ActionAs a practical look into these ideas, suppose that you recently read a fewthought-provoking books about compassion, including one written by the DalaiLama, a biography of Mother Teresa, and an account of the work of Saint Francisof Assisi.This knowledge allowed you to think outside the box. Reading this material wouldhave forged new synaptic connections in your thinking brain. Essentially, youlearned about the philosophy of compassion (through other people’s experiences,not yours). Moreover, you’ve sustained those neural connections by reviewingwhat you learned on a daily basis: You’re so enthusiastic that you are solvingall of your friends’ problems by offering advice and holding court. You havebecome the great philosopher. Intellectually, you know your stuff.As you’re driving home from work, your spouse calls to say that you’ve beeninvited to dinner with your mother-in-law in three days. You pull off the road,and already you’re thinking about how you have disliked your MIL intensely eversince she hurt your feelings ten years ago. Soon you’ve got a mental laundrylist: you never liked her opinionated way of talking; how she interrupts others;how she smells; even how she cooks. Whenever you’re around her, your heartraces, your jaw tightens, your face and body are tense, you feel jittery, andyou just want to jump up and leave.Still sitting in your car, you remember those books on the philosophy ofcompassion, and you think about what you learned theoretically. It occurs toyou, Maybe if I try to apply what I read in those books, I might have a newexperience of my mother-in-law. What did I learn that I can personalize tochange the outcome of this dinner?When you contemplate applying that understanding with your MIL, somethingwonderful begins to happen. You decide not to react to her with your typical setof automatic programs. Instead, you begin to think about who you no longer wantto be, and who you want to be instead. You ask yourself, How do I not want tofeel, and how am I not going to act, when I see her? Your frontal lobe begins to“cool off” the neural circuits that are connected to the old you; you’restarting to unwire or prune away that old you from functioning as an identity.You could say that because your brain isn’t firing in the same way, you’re nolonger creating the same mind.Then you review what those books said to help you plan how you want to think,feel, and act toward your MIL. You ask yourself, How can I modify my behavior—myactions—and my reactions so my new experience leads to a new feeling? So youpicture yourself greeting and hugging her, asking her questions about things youknow she is interested in, and complimenting her on her new hairdo or glasses.Over the next few days, as you mentally rehearse your new ideal of self, youcontinue to install more neurological hardware so you’ll have the propercircuits in place (in effect, a new software program) when you actually interactwith your MIL.For most of us, to go from thinking to doing is like inspiring snails to pick upthe pace. We want to stay in the intellectual, philosophical realm of ourreality; we like to identify with the memorized, recognizable feeling of ourfamiliar self.Instead, by surrendering old thought patterns, interrupting habitual emotionalreactions, and forgoing knee-jerk behaviors, then planning and rehearsing newways of being, you are putting yourself into the equation of that knowledge youlearned, and beginning to create a new mind—you are reminding yourself who youwant to be.But there is another step that we must address here.What happened as you began to observe your “old-personality self” related to thefamiliar thoughts, habitual behaviors, and memorized emotions that youpreviously connected with your mother-in-law? In a way, you were going into theoperating system of the subconscious mind, where those programs exist, and youwere the observer of those programs. When you can become aware of or notice whoyou are being, you are becoming conscious of your unconscious self.As you began to psychologically project yourself into a potential situationahead of the actual experience (the impending dinner), you began to rewire yourneural circuitry to look as though the event (being compassionate toward yourMIL) had already taken place. Once those new neural networks began to fire inunison, your brain created a picture, vision, model, or what I will call ahologram (a multidimensional image) representing the ideal self that you werefocused on being. The instant this happened, you made what you were thinkingabout more real than anything else. Your brain captured the thought as theexperience, and “upscaled” its gray matter to look as though the experience hadalready occurred.Embodying Knowledge Through Experience:Teaching the Body What the Mind Has LearnedSoon it’s game time, and you find yourself sitting at dinner, face-to-face with“good ol’ Mom.” Instead of knee-jerking when her typical behaviors manifest, youstay conscious, remember what you learned, and decide to try it out. Rather thanjudging, attacking, or feeling animosity toward her, you do something completelydifferent for you. Like the books encouraged, you stay in the present moment,open your heart, and really listen to what she’s saying. You no longer hold herto her past.Lo and behold, you modify your behavior and restrain your impulsive emotionalreactions, thereby creating a new experience with your MIL. That activates thelimbic brain to cook up a new blend of chemicals, which generates a new emotion,and all of a sudden, you truly start to feel compassion for her. You see her forwho she is; you even see aspects of yourself in her. Your muscles relax, youfeel your heart opening, and you breathe deeply and freely.You had such a great feeling that day that it lingers. Now you’re inspired andopen-minded, and you find that you truly love your mother-in-law. As you coupleyour new, internal feeling of goodwill and love with this person in yourexternal reality, you connect compassion with your mother-in-law. You form anassociative memory.Once you began to feel the emotion of compassion, in a sense you (chemically)instructed your body what your mind (philosophically) knew, and that activatedand modified some of your genes. Now you’ve gone from thinking to doing: yourbehaviors match your conscious intentions; your actions are equal to yourthought; mind and body are aligned and working together. You did exactly whatthose people did in those books. So by intellectually learning compassion withyour brain and mind, then demonstrating this ideal in your environment throughexperience, you embodied this elevated feeling. You just conditioned your bodyto a new mind of compassion. Your mind and body were working together. Youembodied compassion. In a sense, the word has become flesh.Two Brains Have Taken You from Thinking to Doing,but Can You Create a State of Being?From your efforts to embody compassion, you now have your neocortex and limbicbrain working together. You’re out of the box of the familiar, habitualmemorized self, which operates within a set of automatic programs, and you’re ina new thinking and feeling cycle. You have experienced how compassion feels; andyou like it better than covert hostility, rejection, and suppressed anger.Hold on, though, you are not yet ready for sainthood! It’s not enough to havemind and body working together one time. That got you from thinking to doing,but can you reproduce that feeling of compassion at will? Can you repeatedlyembody compassion independent of conditions in your environment, so that noperson or situation could ever create that old state of being in you again?If not, you haven’t yet mastered compassion. My definition of mastery is thatour internal chemical state is greater than anything in our external world. Youare a master when you’ve conditioned yourself with chosen thoughts and feelings,you’ve memorized desired emotional/chemical states, and nothing in your externallife deters you from your aims. No person, no thing, and no experience at anytime or place should disrupt your internal chemical coherence. You can think,act, and feel differently whenever you choose.image [images/lin2.jpg]If You Can Master Suffering,You Can Just as Easily Master JoyYou probably know someone who has mastered suffering, right? So you call her andask, “How are you?”So-so.“Listen, I’m going to go out with some friends to a new art gallery, and theneat at this restaurant that has really healthy desserts. Afterward, we’re goingto listen to some live music. Would you like to come with us?”No. I don’t feel like it.But if she said what she actually meant, she’d say, I’ve memorized thisemotional state, and nothing in my environment—no person, no experience, nocondition, no thing—is going to move me from my internal chemical state ofsuffering. It feels better to be in pain than to let go and be happy. I amenjoying my addiction for now, and all these things that you want to do mightdistract me from my emotional dependency.But guess what? We can just as easily master an internal chemical state such asjoy or compassion.image [images/lin2.jpg]In the preceding example with your mother-in-law, if you practiced yourthoughts, behaviors, and feelings enough times, “being” compassionate wouldbecome rather natural. You would evolve from just thinking about it, to doingsomething about it, to being it. “Being” means that it’s easy, natural, secondnature, routine, and unconscious. Compassion and love would be as automatic andfamiliar to you as those self-limiting emotions you just changed.So now you need to replicate this experience of thinking, feeling, and actingout of compassion. If you do, you will break the addiction of your pastemotional state and neurochemically condition your body and mind to memorize theinternal chemical state called compassion better than your conscious mind.Ultimately, if you repeatedly re-create the experience of compassion at will,practicing it independent of any circumstance in your life, your body wouldbecome the mind of compassion. You would memorize compassion so well thatnothing from your outside world could move you from this state of being.Now all three brains are working together; and you are biologically,neurochemically, and genetically in a state of compassion. When compassionbecomes unconditionally ordinary and familiar for you, you have progressed fromknowledge to experience to wisdom.image [images/lin2.jpg]Progressing to a State of Being:The Role of Our Two Memory SystemsWe have three brains that allow us to evolve from thinking to doing to being.Take a look at this chart:img [images/p136.jpg]Figure 6B(1). Declarative and nondeclarative memories.There are two memory systems in the brain:— The first system is called declarative or explicit memories. When we rememberand can declare what we have learned or experienced, those are declarativememories. There are two types of declarative memories: knowledge (semanticmemories derived from philosophical knowledge) and experience (episodic memoriesderived from sensory experiences, identified as events in our lives withparticular people, animals, or objects, while we were doing or witnessing acertain thing at a particular time and place). Episodic memories tend to imprintlonger in the brain and body than semantic memories.— The second memory system is called nondeclarative or implicit memories. Whenwe practice something so many times that it’s become second nature—we no longerhave to think about it; it’s like we almost can’t declare how we do it—the bodyand mind are one. This is the seat of our skills, habits, automatic behaviors,associative memories, unconscious attitudes, and emotional reactions.img [images/p137.jpg]Figure 6B(2). Three brains: thinking to doing to being.Thus, when we take what we learn intellectually (neocortex), and apply it,personalize it, or demonstrate it, we will modify our behavior in some way. Whenwe do, we will create a new experience, which will produce a new emotion (limbicbrain). If we can repeat, replicate, or experience that action at will, we willmove into a state of being (cerebellum).image [images/lin2.jpg]Wisdom is accumulated knowledge that has been gained through repeatedexperience. And when “being” compassionate is as natural as suffering; judging;blaming; or being frustrated, negative, or insecure, now we are wise. We areliberated to seize new opportunities, because somehow life seems to organizeitself equal to how or who we are being.img [images/p139.jpg]Figure 6C. This chart shows the progression of how the three brains align tocorrelate different avenues of personal evolution.Going from Thinking Straight to Being:A Prelude to MeditationGoing from thinking to doing to being is a progression that we’ve allexperienced many times, whether it was when we learned to be a driver, a skier,a knitter, or a person to whom speaking a second language has become secondnature.Now, let’s talk about one of evolution’s great gifts to us as humans: theability to go from thinking to being—without taking any physical action. Saidanother way, we can create a new state of being ahead of having an actualmaterial experience.We do this all the time, and it’s not a case of “Fake it till you make it.” Forexample, you have a sexual fantasy in which you inwardly experience all thethoughts, feelings, and actions you look forward to when your partner returnsfrom a trip. You’re so present with your internal experience that your body ischemically altered and responds as if that future event is already upon you inthat exact moment. You have moved into a new state of being. Similarly, whetheryou’re mentally rehearsing the speech you’re going to give, reminding yourselfhow you’re going to handle the confrontation that you need to have with yourco-worker, or imagining what you want to eat when you’re really hungry but stuckin traffic—and in each case you’re thinking about that to the exclusion ofeverything else—your body will begin to move into a state of being just bythought alone.Okay, but how far can you take this? Through thinking and feeling alone, can youfinally be the person you want to be? Can you create and live a chosen reality,as my daughter did when she experienced the summer job of her dreams?That’s where meditation comes in. People use meditative techniques for a lot ofreasons, as you know. In this book, you will learn a special meditation designedfor a specific purpose—to help you overcome the habit of being yourself andbecome that ideal self you desire. Through the remainder of this chapter, we’llconnect some of the knowledge we’ve covered up to now with the meditation youwill soon learn. (Whenever I discuss meditation or the meditative process, Iwill be referring to the process that will be our focus in Part III.)Meditation allows us to change our brains, bodies, and state of being. Mostimportant, we can make these changes without having to take any physical actionor have any interaction with the external environment. Through meditation, wecan install the necessary neurological hardware, just as those piano players andfinger exercisers made changes through mental rehearsal. (Those researchsubjects used mental rehearsal alone, but for our purposes, it is one componentof the meditative process, albeit a very important one.)If I asked you to think about the qualities that your ideal self would possess,or if I suggested that you contemplate what it would feel like to be a person ofgreatness such as Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela, then just by contemplating anew way of being, you would begin firing your brain in new ways and making a newmind. That’s mental rehearsal in action. I’m now asking you to reflect on whatit would feel like to be happy, content, satisfied, and at peace. What would youenvision for yourself if you were to create a new ideal of you?Essentially, the meditative process allows you to answer this question bybringing together all of the information, learned and wired synaptically intoyour brain, about what it means to be happy, content, satisfied, and at peace.In meditation, you take that knowledge and then place yourself in the equation.Instead of merely asking what it would mean to be happy, you put yourself in theposition of practicing, and thus living in, a state of happiness. After all, youknow what happiness looks and feels like. You’ve had past experiences with ityourself; you’ve seen other people’s versions of it. Now, you get to pick andchoose from that knowledge and experience to create a new ideal of yourself.I’ve talked about how, through the frontal lobe, you activate new circuits innew ways to create a new mind. Once you experience that new mind, your braincreates a kind of holographic image that gives you a model to follow in creatingyour future reality. Because you have installed new neural circuits ahead of anyreal experience, you don’t have to carry out a nonviolent revolution, as Gandhidid; you don’t have to lead your people and be burned at the stake, as Joan ofArc was. You simply have to use your knowledge and experience of those qualitiesof courage and conviction to produce an emotional effect within you. The resultwill be a state of mind. By repeatedly producing that state of mind, it willbecome familiar to you, and you will be wiring new circuits. The more often youproduce that state of mind, the more those thoughts will become the experience.Once that thought-experience transformation takes place, the end product of thatexperience will be a feeling, an emotion. When this occurs, your body (as theunconscious mind) does not know the difference between an event that takes placein physical reality and the emotions you created by thought alone.As someone who is conditioning the body to a new mind, you’ll find that yourthinking brain and the emotional brain are now working in concert. Remember thatthoughts are for the brain, and feelings are for the body. When you are boththinking and feeling in a specific way as a part of the meditative process, youare different from when you started out. The newly installed circuits, theneurological and chemical changes that have been produced by those thoughts andemotions, have altered you in such a way that there is physical evidence in thebrain and body that shows those changes.At that point, you’ve moved into a state of being. You’re no longer justpracticing happiness or gratitude or whatever; you are being grateful or happy.You can produce that state of mind and body every day; you can continuallyreexperience an event and produce the emotional response to that experience ofhow you would feel if you were that new, ideal self.If you can get up from your meditative session and be in that new state ofbeing—altered neurologically, biologically, chemically, and genetically—you haveactivated those changes ahead of any experience, and you will be more prone toacting and thinking in ways equal to who you are being. You have broken thehabit of being yourself!img [images/p143.jpg]Figure 6D. You can go from thinking to being without having to do anything. Ifyou are mentally rehearsing a new mind, there will come a moment that thethought you are thinking about will become the experience. When this occurs, theend product of that inward experience is an emotion or feeling. Once you canfeel what it would feel like to be that person, your body (as the unconsciousmind) begins to believe it is in that reality. Now your mind and body begin towork as one, and you are “being” that person without having to do anything yet.As you move into a new state of being by thought alone, you will be more proneto do things and think things equal to how you are being.As a reminder, when you are in a new state of being—a new personality—you alsocreate a new personal reality. Let me repeat that. A new state of being createsa new personality … a new personality produces a new personal reality.How will you know whether this meditative practice has activated your threebrains to produce the intended effect? Simple: you will feel different as aresult of investing in the process. If you feel exactly as you did before, ifthe same catalysts produce the same reactions in you, then nothing has happenedin the quantum field. Your same thoughts and feelings are reproducing the sameelectromagnetic signal in the field. You haven’t changed chemically,neurologically, genetically, or in any other way. But if you eventually get upafter your meditation sessions and feel different from when you began them, andif you can maintain that modified state of mind and body, then you have changed.What you’ve changed inside of you—the new state of being that you created—shouldnow produce an effect outside of you. You’ve moved beyond the cause-and-effectmodel of the universe, that old Newtonian concept of something external to youcontrolling your thoughts, actions, and emotions. I’ll return to this point in abit.You will also know that your meditation has been fruitful if somethingunexpected and new shows up in your life as a result of your efforts. Remember:the quantum model tells us that if you have created a new mind and a new stateof being, you have an altered electromagnetic signature. Because you arethinking and feeling differently, you are changing reality. Together, thoughtsand feelings can do this; separately they cannot. Let me remind you again: Youcan’t think one way and feel another and expect anything in your life to change.The combination of your thoughts and feelings is your state of being. Changeyour state of being … and change your reality.Here’s where coherent signals really come into play. If you can send into thequantum field a signal coherent in thought and feeling (state of being),independent of the external world, then something different will show up in yourlife. When it does, you’ll no doubt experience a powerful emotional response,which will inspire you to create a new reality once again—and you can use thatemotion to generate an even more wonderful experience.Let me get back to Newton. We are all conditioned by the Newtonian notion thatlife is dominated by cause and effect. When something good happens to us, weexpress gratitude or joy. So we go through life waiting for someone or somethingoutside ourselves to regulate our feelings.Instead, I’m asking you to take control and to invert the process. Rather thanwaiting for an occasion to cause you to feel a certain way, create the feelingahead of any experience in the physical realm; convince your body emotionallythat a “gratitude-generating” experience has already taken place.To do this, you can pick a potential in the quantum field and get in touch withhow it would feel if you were experiencing it. I’m asking you to use thought andfeeling to put yourself in the shoes of that future self, that possible you, sovividly that you begin to emotionally condition your body to believe that youare that person now. When you open your eyes after your meditative session, whodo you want to be? What would it feel like to be this ideal self, or to havethis desired experience?To fully break the habit of being yourself, say good-bye to cause and effect andembrace the quantum model of reality. Choose a potential reality that you want,live it in your thoughts and feelings, and give thanks ahead of the actualevent. Can you accept the notion that once you change your internal state, youdon’t need the external world to provide you with a reason to feel joy,gratitude, appreciation, or any other elevated emotion?When your body experiences that the event is occurring in that moment and itfeels real to you, based solely on what you’re focused on mentally and arefeeling emotionally, then you are experiencing the future now. The moment youare in that state of being, in that now moment and present in that experience,that’s when you are connected to all possible realities that exist in thequantum field. Remember that if you are in the past or the future, based on yourfamiliar emotions or anticipation of some effect, you don’t have access to allpossibilities the quantum field holds. The only way to access the quantum fieldis by being in the now.Keep in mind that this cannot be just an intellectual process. Thoughts andfeelings must be coherent. In other words, this meditation requires that youdrop down about ten inches out of your head and move into your heart. Open yourheart and think about how it would feel if you embodied a combination of all thetraits that you admire and that make up your ideal self.You may object that you can’t know how it would feel, because you’ve neverexperienced what it’s like to have those traits and to be that ideal self. Myresponse is that your body can experience this before you have any physicalevidence, ahead of your senses: If a future desire that you’ve never experiencedactually does manifest in your life, you’d have to agree that you wouldexperience an elevated emotion such as joy, excitement, or gratitude … so thoseemotions are what you can naturally focus on. Instead of being enslaved toemotions that are only the residue of the past, you are now using elevatedemotions to create the future.The elevated emotions of gratitude, love, and so forth all have a higherfrequency that will help you move into a state of being where you can feel asthough the desired events have actually occurred. If you are in a state ofgreatness, then the signal you send into the quantum field is that the eventshave already come to pass. Giving thanks allows you to emotionally conditionyour body to believe that what is producing your gratitude has already happened.By activating and coordinating your three brains, meditation allows you to movefrom thinking to being—and once you are in a new state of being, you are moreprone to act and think equal to who you are being.Perhaps you’ve wondered why it may be hard to move into a state of gratitude orto give thanks ahead of the actual experience. Is it possible that you’ve beenliving by a memorized emotion that has become so much a part of your identity,on a subconscious level, that now you cannot feel any other way than you’reaccustomed to? If so, maybe your identity has become a matter of how you appearto the world on the outside, to distract you and change how you feel on theinside.In the next chapter, we’re going to examine how to close that gap and bringabout true liberation. When you can readily feel gratitude or joy, or fall inlove with the future—without needing any person, thing, or experience to causeyou to feel that way—then these elevated emotions will be available to fuel yourcreations.img [images/logo1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER SEVEN [toc.html#ch07]image [images/line.jpg]THE GAP [toc.html#ch07]I was sitting on my couch one day, thinking about what it means to be happy. AsI contemplated my utter lack of joy, I thought about how most people who wereimportant to me would have given me a pep talk right on the spot. I imagined itverbatim: You’re so incredibly lucky. You have a wonderful family, whichincludes beautiful kids. You are a successful chiropractor. You lecture tothousands of people, you travel the world going to unusual places, you werefeatured in What the BLEEP Do We Know!?, and many people loved your message. Youeven wrote a book, and it is doing well. They would have hit all of the rightemotional and logical notes. But to me, something wasn’t right.I was at a point in my life where I was traveling from city to city everyweekend doing lectures; sometimes I was in two cities within three days. Itoccurred to me that I was so busy that I had no time to actually practice what Iwas teaching.This was an unnerving moment, because I began to see that all of my happinesswas created from outside of me, and that the joy I experienced when I wastraveling and lecturing had nothing to do with real joy. It appeared to me thatI needed everyone, everything, and everyplace outside of me in order to feelgood. This image that I was projecting to the world was dependent on externalfactors. And when I was not out lecturing or doing interviews or treatingpatients, and I was home, I felt empty.Don’t get me wrong; in some ways those things outside of me were great. If youhad asked anyone who saw me lecturing, deeply engrossed in working on apresentation during a flight, or answering dozens of e-mails while in an airportor hotel lounge, such an observer would have said that I appeared to be prettyhappy.The sad truth is that if you had asked me at one of those moments, I would haveprobably responded in much the same way: Yes, things are great. I’m doing well.I’m a lucky guy.But if you had caught me in a quiet moment, when all those other stimuli weren’tbombarding me, I would have responded in a completely different manner:Something’s not right. I feel unsettled. Everything feels like the same old,same old. Something is missing.On the day I recognized the core reason for my unhappiness, I also realized thatI needed the external world to remember who I was. My identity had become thepeople I talked to, the cities I visited, the things I did while I wastraveling, and the experiences I needed in order to reaffirm myself as thisperson called Joe Dispenza. And when I wasn’t around anyone who could help merecall this personality that the world might know as me, I wasn’t sure who I wasanymore. In fact, I saw that all of my perceived happiness was really just areaction to stimuli in the external world that made me feel certain ways. I thenunderstood that I was totally addicted to my environment, and I was dependent onexternal cues to reinforce my emotional addiction. What a moment for me. I hadheard a million times that happiness comes from within, but it never hit me likethis before.As I sat on the couch in my house that day, I looked out the window and an imagecame to me. I envisioned my two hands, one above the other, separated by a gap.image [images/hand.jpg]HOW WE APPEAR• The identity I project to the outer environment• Who I want you to think I am• The facade• Ideal for the worldWHO WE REALLY ARE• How I feel• Who I really am• How I am an the inside• Ideal for selfimage [images/hand1.jpg]Figure 7A. The gap between “who we really are” and “how we appear.”The top hand represented how I appeared on the outside, and the bottom was how Iknew myself to be on the inside. In my self-reflection, it dawned on me that wehuman beings live in a duality, as two separate entities—“how we appear” and“who we really are.”How we appear is the image or the façade that we project to the world. That selfis everything we do in order to show up looking a certain way and to present toothers a consistent exterior reality. This first aspect of the self is a veneerof how we want everyone to see us.How we really are, represented by that bottom hand, is how we feel, especiallywhen we are not distracted by the external environment. It is our familiaremotions when we are not preoccupied by “life.” It’s what we hide aboutourselves.When we memorize addictive emotional states such as guilt, shame, anger, fear,anxiety, judgment, depression, self-importance, or hatred, we develop a gapbetween the way we appear and the way we really are. The former is how we wantother people to see us. The latter is our state of being when we are notinteracting with all of the different experiences, diverse things, and assortedpeople at various times and places in our lives. If we sit long enough withoutdoing anything, we begin to feel something. That something is who we really are.THE LAYERS of EMOTIONWE MEMORIZE thatCREATE the GAPimage [images/hand.jpg]Unworthinessimage [images/line1.jpg]Angerimage [images/line1.jpg]Fearimage [images/line1.jpg]Shameimage [images/line1.jpg]Self-doubtimage [images/line1.jpg]Guiltimage [images/line1.jpg]PAST EXPERIENCES WITH REFRACTORY PERIODimage [images/hand1.jpg]Figure 7B. The size of the gap varies from person to person. “Who we really are”and “how we appear” are separated by the feelings we memorize throughoutdifferent points in our lives (based on past experiences). The bigger the gap,the greater the addiction to the emotions we memorize.Layer by layer, we wear various emotions, which form our identity. In order toremember who we think we are, we have to re-create the same experiences toreaffirm our personality and the corresponding emotions. As an identity, webecome attached to our external world by identifying with everyone andeverything, in order to remind us of how we want to project ourselves to theworld.How we appear becomes the façade of the personality, which relies on theexternal world to remember who it is as a “somebody.” Its identity is completelyattached to the environment. The personality does everything it can to hide howit really feels or to make that feeling of emptiness go away: I own these cars,I know these people, I’ve been to these places, I can do these things, I’ve hadthese experiences, I work for this company, I am successful. … It is who wethink we are in relation to everything around us.But that is different from who we are—how we feel—without the stimulation of ourouter reality: Feelings of shame and anger about a failed marriage. Fear ofdeath and uncertainty about the afterlife, related to the loss of a loved one oreven a pet. A sense of inadequacy due to a parent’s insistence on perfectionismand achievement at all costs. A sense of stifled entitlement from having grownup in circumstances barely above poverty. A preoccupation with thoughts of nothaving the right body type in order to look a certain way to the world. Thesekinds of feelings are what we want to conceal.This is who we truly are, the real self hiding behind the image we areprojecting. We can’t face exposing that self to the world, so we pretend to besomeone else. We create a set of memorized automatic programs that work to coverthe vulnerable parts of us. Essentially, we lie about who we are because we knowthat societal mores do not have room for that person. That is the “nobody.” Thatis the person whom we doubt others will like and accept.Particularly when we are younger and are forming our identity, we are morelikely to engage in this kind of masquerade. We see young people trying onidentities like they try on clothes. And in truth, what teens wear is often areflection of who they want to be, more than it reflects who they really are.Ask any mental-health professional who specializes in working with young people,and she will tell you that one word defines what it is like to be an adolescent:insecurity. As a result, teens and preteens seek comfort in conformity and innumbers.Rather than let the world know what you are really like, adopt and adapt(because everyone knows what happens to those who are perceived to bedifferent). The world is complex and scary, but make it less frightening andmuch simpler by lumping everyone into groups. Pick your group. Pick your poison.Eventually, that identity fits. You grow into it. Or at least that’s what youtell yourself. Along with the insecurity comes a great deal ofself-consciousness. Questions abound: Is this who I really am? Is this who Ireally want to be? But it’s so much easier to ignore those questions than toanswer them.Life Experiences Define Our Identity …Staying Busy Keeps Unwanted Emotions at BayAll of us have been emotionally scarred from traumatic or difficult experiencesas young people. Early in life, we experienced defining events, the emotions ofwhich contributed, layer by layer, to who we became. Let’s face it: we all havebeen branded by emotionally charged events. As we mentally reviewed theexperience repeatedly, the body began to relive the event over and over, just bythought alone. We kept the refractory period of emotion running for so long thatwe journeyed from a mere emotional reaction to a mood, to a temperament, andultimately, to a personality trait.While we are young, we keep busy doing things that, for a while, stave off thoseold, deep emotions, sweeping them under the rug. It is intoxicating to make newfriends, travel to unknown places, work hard and achieve a promotion, learn anew skill, or take up a new sport. We seldom suspect that many of these actionsare motivated by feelings left over from certain earlier events in life.Then we really get busy. We go to school, then possibly college; we buy a car;we move to a new town, state, or country; we begin a career; we meet new people;we get married; we buy a house; we have kids; we adopt pets; we may getdivorced; we work out; we start a new relationship; we practice a skill or ahobby…. We use everything that we know in the external world to define ouridentity, and to distract us from how we really feel inside. And since all ofthese unique experiences produce myriad emotions, we notice that those emotionsseem to take away any feelings that we are hiding. And it works for a while.Don’t get me wrong. We all reach greater heights from applying ourselvesthroughout different periods in our growing years. In order to accomplish manythings in our lifetimes, we have to push ourselves outside our comfort zones andgo beyond familiar feelings that once defined us. I am certainly aware of thisdynamic in life. But when we never overcome our limitations and continuecarrying the baggage from our past, it will always catch up with us. And thisusually happens starting around our mid-30s (this can vary greatly from oneperson to another).Midlife: A Series of Strategiesto Make Buried Feelings Stay BuriedBy our mid-30s or 40s, when the personality is complete, we have experiencedmuch of what life has to offer. And as a result, we can pretty much anticipatethe outcome of most experiences; we already know how they’re going to feelbefore we engage in them. Because we’ve had several good and bad relationships,we’ve competed in business or settled into our career, we’ve suffered loss andencountered success, or we know what we like and dislike, we know the nuances oflife. Since we can predict the likely emotions ahead of an actual experience, wedetermine whether we want to experience that “known” event before it actuallyoccurs. Of course, all of this is happening behind the scenes of our awareness.Here is where it gets sticky. Because we can predict the feelings that mostevents will bring, we already know what will make our feelings about who wereally are go away. However, when we reach midlife, nothing can completely takeaway that feeling of emptiness.You wake up every morning and you feel like the same person. Your environment,which you relied on so heavily to remove your pain or guilt or suffering, is nolonger taking away those feelings. How could it? You already know that when theemotions derived from the external world wear off, you will return to being thesame leopard who hasn’t changed its spots.This is the midlife crisis that most people know about. Some try really hard tomake buried feelings stay buried by diving further into their external world.They buy the new sports car (thing); others lease the boat (another thing). Somego on a long vacation (place). Yet others join the new social club to meet newcontacts or make new friends (people). Some get plastic surgery (body). Manycompletely redecorate or remodel their homes (acquire things and experience anew environment).All of these are futile efforts to do or try something new so that they can feelbetter or different. But emotionally, when the novelty wears off, they are stillstuck with the same identity. They return to who they really are (that is, thebottom hand). They are drawn back to the same reality they have been living foryears, just to keep the feeling of who they think they are as an identity. Thetruth is, the more they do—the more they buy and then consume—the morenoticeable the feeling of who they “really are” becomes.When we’re trying to escape this emptiness, or when we’re running from anyemotion whatsoever that is painful, it is because to look at it is toouncomfortable. So when the feeling starts to get a bit out of control, mostpeople turn on the TV, surf the Internet, or call or text someone. In a matterof moments we can alter our emotions so many times … we can view a sitcom or aYouTube video and laugh hysterically, then watch a football game and feelcompetitive, then watch the news and be angered or fearful. All of these outerstimuli can easily distract us from those unwanted feelings inside.Technology is a great distraction and a powerful addiction. Think about it: Youcan immediately change your internal chemistry and make a feeling go away bychanging something outside of you. And whatever it was outside of you that madeyou feel better inside of you, you will rely on that thing in order to sidetrackyourself over and over again. But this strategy doesn’t have to involvetechnology; anything momentarily thrilling will do the trick.When we keep that diversion up, guess what eventually happens? We grow moredependent on something outside of us to change us internally. Some peopleunconsciously delve deeper and deeper into this bottomless pit, using differentaspects of their world to keep themselves preoccupied—in an effort to re-createthe original feeling from the very first experience that helped them escape.They become overstimulated so that they can feel different from how they reallyare. But sooner or later, everyone realizes that they need more and more of thesame to make them feel better. This becomes an all-consuming search for pleasureand ways to avoid pain at all costs—a hedonistic life unconsciously driven bysome feeling that won’t seem to go away.A Different Midlife: A Time for FacingFeelings and Letting Go of IllusionsAt this time of life, other people who don’t strive to keep their feelingsburied ask some big questions: Who am I? What is my purpose in life? Where am Igoing? Who am I doing all of this for? What is God? Where do I go when I die? Isthere more to life than “success”? What is happiness? What does all this mean?What is love? Do I love myself? Do I love anyone else? And the soul begins towake up….These types of questions begin to occupy the mind because we see through theillusion and suspect that nothing outside of us can ever make us happy. Some ofus ultimately realize that nothing in our environment is going to “fix” the waywe feel. We also recognize the enormous amount of energy it takes to keep upthis projection of self as an image to the world, and how exhausting it is tokeep the mind and body constantly preoccupied. Eventually we come to see thatour futile attempt to maintain an ideal for others is really a strategy to makesure that those impending feelings we’ve been running from never capture us. Howlong can we juggle, keeping so many balls in the air, just so our lives don’tcome crashing down?Instead of buying a bigger TV or the latest smart phone, these people stoprunning from the feeling that they’ve been trying to make go away for so long,face it head-on, and intently look at it. When this happens, the individualbegins to wake up. After some self-reflection, she discovers who she really is,what she has been hiding, and what no longer is working for her. So she lets goof the façade, the games, and the illusions. She is honest about who she reallyis, at all costs, and she is not afraid to lose it all. This person stopsexpending the energy she had been putting into keeping an illusory image intact.She gets in touch with her feelings and then turns to people in her life andsays: You know what? It doesn’t matter if I don’t make you happy any longer. I’mthrough obsessing about how I look or what other people think about me. I amfinished living for everyone else. I want to be free from these chains.This is a profound moment in a person’s life. The soul is waking up and nudgingher to tell the truth about who she really is! The lie is over.Change and Our Relationships:Breaking the Ties That BindMost relationships are based on what you have in common with others. Think aboutthis: You meet a person, and immediately the two of you compare yourexperiences, as if you both are checking to see whether your neural networks andemotional memories are aligned. You say something like this: “I know these‘people.’ I am from this ‘place,’ and I lived in these places at these different‘times’ in my life. I went to this school and studied this subject. I own and dothese ‘things.’ And most important, I’ve had these ‘experiences.’”Then the other person responds: “I know those ‘people.’ I’ve lived in those‘places’ during those ‘times.’ I do these ‘things,’ too. I had those same‘experiences.’”Thus, you can relate to each other. A relationship is then formed based onneurochemical states of being, because if you share the same experiences, youshare the same emotions.Think of emotions as “energy in motion.” If you share the same emotions, youshare the same energy. And just like two atoms of oxygen that share an invisiblefield of energy beyond space and time in order to bond together in arelationship to form air, you are bonded in an invisible field of energy toevery thing, person, and place in your external life. Bonds between people arethe strongest, though, because emotions hold the strongest energy. As long aseither party doesn’t change, things will be just fine.image [images/p184.jpg]Figure 7C. If we share the same experiences, we share the same emotions and thesame energy. Just like two atoms of oxygen bond to form the air we breathe, aninvisible field of energy (beyond space and time) bonds us emotionally.So when our friend in the example in the last section begins to tell the truthabout how she really feels, things begin to get very uncomfortable. If herfriendships have been based upon complaining about life, then she is bondedenergetically in her relationships by the emotions of victimization. If, in amoment of enlightenment, she now decides to break from that habit of beingherself, she is no longer showing up as that familiar person to whom everyonecould relate. People in her life are using her to remind themselves of who theyare emotionally as well. Friends and family respond: “What is wrong with youtoday? You’ve hurt my feelings!” Which translates to: I thought we had a goodthing going here! I used you to reaffirm my emotional addiction in order toremember who I think I am as a “somebody.” I liked you better the other way.When it comes to change, our energy is connected to everything that we’ve had anexperience with in our outer world. When we break the addiction of emotion we’vememorized, or when we tell the truth about who we really are, doing that takessome real energy. Just as it takes energy to separate two atoms of oxygen thatare bonded together, it takes energy to break the bonds with the people in ourlives.So the individuals in this person’s life who have shared the same emotionalbonds with her rally together and say, “She hasn’t been herself lately. Maybeshe’s lost her mind. Let’s get her to a doctor!”Now remember that they have been people she shared the same experiences with;hence, they shared the same emotions. But now she’s breaking the energetic bondswith everyone and everything—and even every place—familiar. This is athreatening moment for everyone who has been playing the same game with her foryears. She’s getting off the train.So they bring her to the doctor, who gives her Prozac or some other drug, and ina short time, the person’s former personality returns. And there she is,projecting her old image to the world, right back to shaking hands on others’emotional agreements. Once more she’s numb and smiling—anything to take thefeeling away. The lesson goes unlearned.Yes, the person wasn’t being herself—not the “top-hand” self that everyone hadgrown accustomed to. Instead, briefly, she was the “bottom-hand” self—the onewith the past and the pain. And who can blame those loved ones who insisted onthe return to her former numbed self that “went along to get along”? That newself emerged as unpredictable, even radical. Who wants to be around that person?Who wants to be around the truth?What Really Matters in the EndIf you need the environment in order to remember who you are as a somebody, whathappens when you die and the environment rolls up and disappears? Do you knowwhat goes with it? The somebody, the identity, the image, the personality (tophand) that has identified with all of the known and predictable elements inlife, who was addicted to the environment. You could have been the mostsuccessful, popular, or beautiful person, and you could have had all the wealthyou ever needed … but when your life ends and your external reality is takenaway, everything outside of you can no longer define you. It all goes.What you’re left with is who you really are (bottom hand), not how you appear.When your life is over and you cannot rely on your external world to define you,you will be left with that feeling you never addressed. You would not haveevolved as a soul in that lifetime.For instance, if you had certain experiences 50 years prior that marked you asinsecure or weak and you felt that way about yourself ever since, then youstopped growing emotionally 50 years ago. If the soul’s purpose is to learn fromexperience and gain wisdom, but you stayed stuck in that particular emotion, younever turned your experience into a lesson; you didn’t transcend that emotionand exchange it for any understanding. While that feeling still anchors yourmind and body to those past events, you are never free to move into the future.And if a similar experience shows up in your present life, that event willtrigger the same emotion and you will act as that person you were 50 years ago.So your soul says: Pay attention! I’m letting you know that nothing is bringingyou joy. I’m sending you urges. If you keep playing this game, I’m going to stoptrying to get your attention, and you will go back to sleep. Then I’ll see youwhen your life is over. …It Always Takes More and MoreMost people who do not know how to change think, How can I make this feeling goaway? And if the novelty of accumulating new things wears off and stops working,what do they do? They look to bigger things, a whole other layer above wherethey were, and their avoidance strategies become addictions: If I take a drug ordrink enough alcohol, that’s going to make this feeling go away. This externalthing will produce an internal chemical change and make me feel great. I’ll shopa lot, because shopping—even if I don’t have the money—makes that emptiness goaway. I’ll watch pornography … I’ll play video games … I’ll gamble … I’llovereat….image [images/p188.jpg]Figure 7D. When the same people and things in our lives create the sameemotions, and the feeling we are trying to make go away no longer changes, welook for new people and things, or try going to new places, in an attempt tochange how we feel emotionally. If that doesn’t work, we go to the nextlevel—addictions.Whatever the addiction, people are still thinking that some external thing isgoing to take that internal feeling away. And remember: we have this naturalpropensity to associate an external thing that’s making that feeling go awaywith our internal chemical change. And we like that external thing if it makesus feel good. So we run away from what feels bad or painful, and we move towardwhat feels good and comfortable or brings us pleasure.As the excitement people get from their addiction continually stimulates thepleasure centers in the brain, they get a flood of chemicals from the thrill ofthe experience. The problem is that each time they gamble, binge, or stay uplate playing online games, they need a little bit more the next time.The reason why people need more drugs or more shopping or more affairs is thatthe chemical rush that’s created from those activities activates the receptorsites on the outside of their cells, which “turns on” the cells. But if receptorsites are continually stimulated, they get desensitized and shut off. So theyneed a stronger signal, a bit more stimulation, to turn them on the next time—ittakes a bigger chemical high to produce the same effects.So now you’ve got to bet $25,000 instead of $10,000 because otherwise, there’sno thrill. Once a $5,000 shopping spree does nothing for you, you’ve got to maxout two credit cards so you can feel that same rush again. All of this is tomake the feeling of who you really are go away. Everything you do to get thesame high, you have to keep doing more of, with increasing intensity. Moredrugs, more alcohol, more sex, more gambling, more shopping, more TV. You getthe idea.Over time, we become addicted to something in order to ease the pain or anxietyor depression we live by on a daily basis. Is this wrong? Not really. Mostpeople do these things because they just don’t know how to change from theinside. They are only following the innate drive to get relief from theirfeelings, and unconsciously they think their salvation comes from the outsideworld. It has never been explained to them that using the outer world to changethe inner world makes things worse … it only widens the gap.And let’s say that our ambition in life is to become successful and toaccumulate more things. When we do, we reinforce who we are, without everaddressing how we really feel. I call this being possessed by our possessions.We become possessed by material objects, and those things reinforce the ego,which needs the environment to remind itself of who it is.If we wait for anything outside us to make us happy, then we are not followingthe quantum law. We are relying on the outer to change the inner. If we arethinking that once we have the wealth to buy more things, then we will beoverjoyed, we’ve got it backward. We have to become happy before our abundanceshows up.And what happens if addicts can’t get more? They feel even angrier, morefrustrated, more bitter, more empty. They may try other methods—add gambling todrinking, add shopping to TV and movie escapism. Eventually, though, nothing isever enough. The pleasure centers have recalibrated to such a high level thatwhen there is no chemical change from the outer world, it seems the addict nowcannot find joy in the simplest things.The point is, true happiness has nothing to do with pleasure, because thereliance on feeling good from such intensely stimulating things only moves usfurther from real joy.The Bigger Gap—Emotional AddictionI don’t intend to diminish the severity of the damage caused by what I’llloosely refer to here as material addictions—to drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling,consumerism, and so forth. Those problems cause great harm to the numerouspeople who suffer from them and to those who love and work with such “addicts.”While many people who experience these and other addictions can use the steps inthese pages to overcome them—since they are a part of the Big Three—it’s beyondthe scope of this book to deal with these kinds of addictions specifically. Butit is imperative to realize that behind every addiction, there is some memorizedemotion that is driving the behavior.What is not beyond the scope of this book and is, in fact, its central purposeis helping people break the habit of being themselves, whether they view thatself as being an alcoholic; a sexaholic; a gambler; a shopaholic; or someone whois chronically lonely, depressed, angry, bitter, or physically unwell.In thinking about the gap, possibly you said to yourself: Well, of course wehide from other people our fears, insecurities, weaknesses, and dark side. If wegave those things free rein to be fully expressed, we’d likely be beyond anyoneelse’s caring about us, let alone our caring about ourselves. In a sense, that’strue. But if we are to break free, it means we have to confront that true selfand bring out into the light that shadow side of our personality.The advantage of the system I employ is that you can confront those darkeraspects of yourself without bringing them into the light of your everydayreality. You don’t have to walk into your place of work or a family gatheringand announce: “Hey, listen up, everyone! I’m a bad person because for a longtime I resented my parents for having to spend a lot of time with my youngersibling, while I felt my needs were being neglected. So now I’m a really selfishperson who craves attention and needs instant gratification in order to stopfeeling unloved and inadequate.”Instead, in the privacy of your own home and your own mind, you can work onextinguishing negative aspects of self and replacing those characteristics (orat least, metaphorically, cutting way back on the role they play and allowingthem only an occasional, brief appearance) with more positive and productiveones.I want you to forget about past events validating the emotions you’ve memorizedthat have become part of your personality. Your problems will never be resolvedby analyzing them while you are still caught up in the emotions of the past.Looking at the experience or reliving the event that created the problem in thefirst place will only bring up the old emotions and a reason to feel the sameway. When you try to figure out your life within the same consciousness thatcreated it, you will analyze your life away and excuse yourself from everchanging.Instead, let’s just unmemorize our self-limiting emotions. A memory without theemotional charge is called wisdom. Then we can look back objectively upon theevent and see it and who we were being, without the filter of that emotion. Ifwe take care of unmemorizing the emotional state (or eliminating it to the bestof our ability), then we gain the freedom to live and think and act independentof the restraints or constraints of that feeling.So if a person relinquished unhappiness and got on with his life—entered into anew relationship, got a new job, moved to a new place, and made new friends—andthen he looked at that past event, he would see that it provided the adversityhe needed in order to overcome who he was and become a new person. Hisperspective would change, just by seeing that he could actually overcome theproblem.Closing and even eliminating the gap between who we are and who we present tothe world is likely the greatest challenge we all face in life. Whether we termthis living authentically, conquering ourselves, or having people “get” us oraccept us for who we are, this is something that most of us desire.Changing—-closing the gap—must begin from within.Yet far too often, most of us change only when we are faced with a crisis,trauma, or discouraging diagnosis of some sort. That crisis commonly comes inthe form of a challenge, which may be physical (an accident, say, or anillness), emotional (the loss of someone we love, for example), spiritual (forinstance, an accumulation of setbacks that has us questioning our worth and howthe universe operates), or financial (a job loss, perhaps). Note that all of theabove are about losing something.Why wait for trauma or loss to occur and have your ego get knocked off balancedue to that negative emotional state? Clearly, when a calamity befalls you, youhave to act—you can’t take care of business as usual when you’ve been knocked,as the expression goes, to your knees.At those critical moments when we’ve really, really grown tired of being beatendown by circumstances, we’ll say: This can’t go on. I don’t care what it takesor how I feel [body]. I don’t care how long it takes [time]. No matter what’sgoing on in my life [environment], I’m going to change. I have to.We can learn and change in a state of pain and suffering, or we can do so in astate of joy and inspiration. We don’t have to wait until we are souncomfortable that we feel forced to move out of our resting state.Side Effects of Closing the GapAs you know, one of the key skills you need to develop isself-awareness/self-observation. That’s a shortcut definition of what I meanwhen I talk about meditation in the next chapter. In meditation, you’re going tolook at the negative emotional state that has had such an impact on your life.You’re going to recognize the primary state of your personality that drives yourthoughts and behaviors so that you become intimately familiar with every nuanceof them. Over time, you’re going to use those powers of observation to help youunmemorize that negative emotional state. By doing so, you will surrender thatemotion to a greater mind, closing the gap between who you are and who you havepresented to the world in the past.Picture yourself standing in a room with arms outstretched, pushing the oppositewalls apart. Do you have any idea how much energy you would consume if you weretrying to keep those walls from crushing you? Instead of doing that, what if youreleased those two walls, took a couple of steps forward (after all, that gap iskind of like a door, isn’t it?), and walked out of that room and into acompletely new one. What about that other room you left behind? Well, the wallshave come together in such a way that you can’t ever get back inside it. Thatgap has closed, and the separate parts of you have become unified. And what’sgoing to happen to all that energy you were expending? Physics states thatenergy can’t be created or destroyed; it can only be transferred or transformed.That’s exactly what’s going to happen to you when you get to the point that nothought, no emotion, no subconscious behavior goes unnoticed.You can think of this another way: You’ll be going into the operating system ofthe subconscious and bringing all that data and those instructions into yourconscious awareness, to truly see where those urges and proclivities that havetaken control of your life are located. You become conscious of your unconsciousself.When we break the chains of that bond, we liberate the body. It is no longer themind, living in the same past day after day. When we liberate the bodyemotionally, we close the gap. When we close the gap, we release the energy thatwas once used to produce it. With that energy, we now have the raw material wecan use to create a new life.image [images/p194.jpg]Figure 7E. As you unmemorize any emotion that has become part of your identity,you close the gap between how you appear and who you really are. The side effectof this phenomenon is a release of energy in the form of a stored emotion in thebody. Once the mind of that emotion is liberated from the body, energy is freedup into the quantum field for you to use as a creator.Another side effect of breaking the bonds of your emotional addictions is thatthis release of energy is like a healthy shot of some wonderful elixir. Not onlyare you energized, but you feel something you likely haven’t felt in quite awhile—joy. When you liberate the body from the chains of an emotionaldependency, you will feel uplifted and inspired. Have you ever taken a long cartrip? When you get out of your vehicle and finally stretch a bit and breathefresh air, and the sound of the car’s tires on the pavement or the heater’s fanor the air conditioner’s whir falls silent, that’s a great feeling. Imagine howmuch better those new sensations would feel if you’d been locked in the trunkfor 2,000 miles! For a lot of us, that’s exactly how we’ve been feeling for asignificant stretch of time.Keep in mind that it’s not enough merely to notice how you’ve been thinking,feeling, and behaving. Meditation requires you to be more active than that. Youalso have to tell the truth about yourself. You have to come clean and revealwhat you’ve been hiding in that shadow part of the gap. You have to drag thosethings out into the bright light of day. And when you really see what you’vebeen doing to yourself, you have to look at that mess and say, This is no longerserving my best interests. This is no longer serving me. This has never beenloving to myself. Then you can make a decision to be free.From Victimization to Unexpected Abundance:How One Woman Closed the GapOne person who reaped the rewards of facing her life with the courage of aquantum observer is Pamela, a participant in one of my seminars. Pamelastruggled financially because for two years, her unemployed ex-husband hadn’tpaid the mandated child support. Frustrated, angry, and feeling victimized, sheeven reacted negatively to unrelated situations.The meditation we did that day was about how the end product of any experienceis an emotion. Because so many of our experiences involve family and friends, weshare the resultant emotions with them. That’s usually a good thing: bondsrelated to places we’ve been, things we’ve done—even objects we’ve shared—canstrengthen our connection with people. But the flip side is that we also sharethe emotions associated with negative experiences.We bond energetically with one another in a place beyond time and space. Becausewe are entangled with others (to use quantum terms) and frequently bond throughsurvival-oriented emotions, it is almost impossible for us to change when we arestill connected by negative experiences and emotions. Thus, reality stays thesame.In Pamela’s case, her ex-husband’s anxiety, guilt, and feelings of inferiorityabout not being able to support his children were interwoven into the fabric ofher state of being, along with her own emotions of victimization, resentment,and lack. Whenever opportunity knocked, her victimhood reared its ugly head andproduced an undesirable outcome. Her destructive emotions and the energyassociated with them had virtually frozen her in a stagnant state of thinking,doing, and being. No matter what she did to try to change this situation, sheand her ex-husband were bonded together by their mutual negative experiences,emotions, and energies; and thus none of her efforts ever changed hercircumstances with him.The workshop helped Pamela realize that she had to break this bond. She had tolet go of the emotions that defined her in her present reality. She also learnedhow a cycle of thinking, feeling, and acting in the same way for years couldproduce a cascade effect that might trigger genes for disease—and she didn’twant that to happen. Something had to give.I like that phrase, because as Pamela told me afterward, during the meditationshe recognized the injurious emotions that her victimization had set inmotion—impatience with her kids, complaining and blaming, and feelings ofdesperation and lack. She let go of those emotions associated with pastexperiences, simultaneously releasing her self-involved state of being, and gavethem up to the greater mind.In so doing, Pamela released all of that frozen energy into the quantum field,closing the gap between who she thought she was and who she presented to theworld. She did this so well—she started to feel so overjoyed and grateful—thatshe wanted abundance for everyone, not just herself. She moved from selfishemotions to selfless emotions. She got up from that meditation a differentperson from who she was before it.Pamela’s energy release signaled the field to begin organizing outcomes thatwere just right for the new self she was in the process of becoming. Almostimmediately, she received evidence of this in two forms.The first involved her Internet business. When she had previously tried apromotion, she fretted about the response to it, constantly checking herwebsite, and saw only mediocre results. She initiated her second promotion themorning of the workshop, but was too busy to think about the results during theday. That evening, she was feeling the positive effects of having let go of thepast. She felt even better when she discovered that she had earned nearly$10,000 that day from the promotion she’d run!Pamela received the second piece of evidence three days later when hercaseworker called to report that her ex had sent a check not just for thatmonth, but for the full $12,000 in back support payments that he owed. She wasbeyond pleased to have “made” nearly $22,000 after doing that meditation. Shedid nothing in the physical realm to bring about those results, and couldn’thave predicted how that money would find its way to her, but she was enormouslygrateful that it had.What Pamela’s story illustrates is the power of letting go of negative emotions.When we are mired in our timeworn mind-set and habitual behaviors andperceptions, there’s no way for us to find solutions to problems rooted in thepast. And those problems (experiences, really) produce powerful energeticemotions. Once we relinquish those, we experience an enormous release of energy,and reality magically rearranges itself.By Moving Out of the Past,We Can Set Our Sights on the FutureThink about how much of your creative energy is tied up in guilt, judgment,fear, or anxiety related to people and experiences from your past. Imagine howmuch good you could do by converting any destructive energy to productiveenergy. Contemplate what you could accomplish if you weren’t focused on survival(a selfish emotion), but instead worked to create out of positive intentions (aselfless emotion).Ask yourself: What energy from past experiences (in the form of limitedemotions) am I holding on to that reinforces my past identity and emotionallyattaches me to my current circumstances? Could I use this same energy andtransform it into an elevated state from which to create a new and differentoutcome?Meditating will help you peel away some of the layers, remove some of the masksyou’ve worn. Both of those things have blocked the flow of that grandintelligence within you. As a result of shedding those layers, you will becometransparent. You are transparent when how you appear is who you are. And whenyou live your life that way, you will experience a state of gratitude, ofelevated joy, which I believe is our natural state of being. As you do this, youbegin to move out of the past so that you can set your sights on the future.As you remove the veils that block the flow of this intelligence within you, youbecome more like it. You become more loving, more giving, more conscious, morewillful—because that is its mind. The gap closes.At that stage, you feel happy and whole. You no longer rely on the externalworld to define you. The elevated emotions you are feeling are unconditional.Nobody else and no event can make you feel that way. You are happy and feelinspired just because of who you are.You no longer live in a state of lack or want. And do you know the funny thingabout not wanting or lacking for anything? That’s when you can really begin tomanifest things naturally. Most people try to create in a state of lack,unworthiness, separation, or some other limited emotion rather than from a stateof gratitude, enthusiasm, or wholeness. That’s when the field responds mostfavorably to you.All this starts with recognizing that the gap exists, and meditating on thenegative emotional states that have produced that gap and dominated yourpersonality. Unless you are prepared to look closely at yourself, and assessyour propensities with tender honesty (not beating yourself up for yourfailings), you will forever be mired in some past event and the negativeemotions it produced. See it. Understand it. Release it. Create with the energyavailable to you by taking the mind out of the body and releasing it into thefield.image [images/lin2.jpg]> The Advertising Connection> > Please understand that advertising agencies and their corporate clients fully> understand the notion of lack and how it plays a commanding role in our> behavior.

So I’d like to close this chapter by tellingyou the rest of the story….Around the time this happened, I was traveling frequently, lecturing to peoplewho had seen me in the movie What the BLEEP Do We Know!? When I was speaking infront of groups, I felt really alive, and I’m sure I came across as happy. Butin that moment, I was feeling numb. That’s when it hit me. I had to show upbeing how everybody expected me to be, based on how I appeared in the movie. I’dstarted believing I was somebody else, and I needed the world to remind me ofwho I thought I was. I was actually living two different lives. No longer did Iwant to be trapped by that.As I sat alone that morning, I felt my heart beating, and I started thinkingabout who was beating my heart. I realized in one instant that I had distancedmyself from this innate intelligence. I closed my eyes and put all of myattention on it. I started to admit who I’d been, what I’d been hiding, and howunhappy I was. I began to surrender some aspects of myself to a greater mind.I then reminded myself of who I no longer wanted to be. I decided how I nolonger wanted to live based on that same personality. Next, I observed myunconscious behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that reinforced my old self andreviewed them until they became familiar to me.Then I thought about who I did want to be as a new personality … until I becameit. Suddenly I began to feel different—joyful. This had nothing to do with allof those things outside of me; it was part of an identity that was independentof any of that external stuff. I knew that I was on to something.I had an immediate reaction after that first meditation on the couch, and itcaught my attention, because I didn’t get up as the same person who had satdown. I stood up and I felt so aware and so alive. It was like I was seeing somany things for the first time. Some mask was removed from me, and I wanted moreof that.So I retreated from my life for about six months. I kept up my clinical practiceto some degree, but I canceled all my lectures. My friends thought I was losingmy mind (I was), because What the BLEEP was at its height, and they reminded meabout how much money I could have been making. But I said I would never walkonstage again until I was no longer living an ideal for the world, but one formyself. I didn’t want to lecture again until I was the living example ofeverything that I was talking about. I needed to take time for my meditationsand to make true change in my life, and I wanted to have joy from within me andnot from outside of me. And I wanted that to come across when I lectured.My transformation wasn’t immediate. I meditated every day, looking at myunwanted emotions, and one by one, I began to unmemorize them. I started mymeditative processes of unlearning and relearning, and I worked for months tochange myself. In the process, I was intentionally dismantling my old identityand breaking the habit of being myself.That’s when I began to feel joyful for no reason. I became happier and happier,and it had nothing to do with anything outside me. Today, I make time tomeditate every morning because I want more of that state of being.image [images/circle.jpg]Whatever has drawn you to this book, when you make up your mind to change, youhave to move to a new consciousness. You must become very clear about whatyou’re doing, how you’re thinking, how you’re living, how you’re feeling, andhow you’re being … to the point that it isn’t you, and you don’t want to be itany longer. And that shift has to reach you on a gut level.What you’re about to learn is what I did, the steps I took in making my ownpersonal changes. But take heart—you very well may have done something similarin your life already. There is just a little more knowledge to come, related tothe meditative process, in order for you to make this method of change a skill.So let’s get to it.image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER EIGHT [toc.html#ch08]image [images/line.jpg]MEDITATION, DEMYSTIFYING THE MYSTICAL, AND WAVES OF YOUR FUTURE [toc.html#ch08]In the previous chapter, I wrote about the need to bridge the space between whowe really are and the image we present to the world. When we’re able to do that,we can take steps toward freeing up the necessary energy to become that idealself, modeled after some of the great people in the history of the world, suchas Gandhi and Joan of Arc.And as I’ve said, one of the keys to breaking the habit of being yourself isworking toward being more observant—whether that entails being moremetacognitive (monitoring your thoughts), embracing stillness, or focusing moreattention on your behaviors and how elements in your environment might triggeremotional responses. So the big question here is: How do you do all this?In other words, how do you become more observant; break your emotional bondswith the body, the environment, and time; and close the gap?The answer is simple: meditation. You may have noticed that up to this point inthe book, I have teased you with brief allusions to meditation as the way tobreak the habit of being yourself and begin to create a new life as your idealself. I told you that the information in Parts I and II of this book wouldprepare you to understand what you will be doing when you apply the meditativesteps you will practice in Part III. Now it’s time to explain the inner workingsof the process that I refer to as meditation.When I use the term meditation, an image of a person seated cross-legged infront of a shrine at home, a bearded and gowned yogi sitting in a secluded cavein the Himalayas, or some other visual may come to mind. That individual may bea representation of what you understand is the way to “go quiet,” empty themind, focus all of one’s attention on a thought, or engage in any of the othervariations of the practice of meditation.There are a lot of meditative techniques, but in this book, my wish is to helpyou produce the most desirable benefit of meditation—being able to access andenter the operating system of the subconscious mind so that you move away fromsimply being yourself and your thoughts, beliefs, actions, and emotions, toobserving those things … and then once you’re there, to subconsciouslyreprogramming your brain and body to a new mind. When you move fromunconsciously producing thoughts, beliefs, actions, and emotions and takecontrol of them through the conscious application of your will, you can unlockthe chains of being your old self to become a new self. How you get to the pointat which you are able to access that operating system and bring the unconsciousinto your consciousness is the subject we’ll cover through the rest of thisbook.One Definition of Meditation:Becoming Familiar with SelfIn the Tibetan language, to meditate means “to become familiar with.”Accordingly, I use the term meditation as a synonym for self-observation as wellas self-development. After all, to become familiar with anything, we have tospend some time observing it. Again, the key moment in making any change isgoing from being it to observing it.Another way to think of this transition is when you go from being a doer to adoer/watcher. An easy analogy I can use is that when athletes orperformers—golfers, skiers, swimmers, dancers, singers, or actors—want to changesomething about their technique, most coaches have them watch videotape ofthemselves. How can you change from an old mode of operation to a new one unlessyou can see what old and new look like?It’s the same with your old and your new self. How can you stop doing things oneway without knowing what that way looks like? I frequently use the termunlearning to describe this phase of changing.This process of becoming familiar with the self works both ways—you need to“see” the old and the new self. You have to observe yourself so precisely andvigilantly, as I’ve described, that you won’t allow any unconscious thought,emotion, or behavior to go unnoticed. Since you have the equipment to do thisbecause of the size of your frontal lobe, you can look at yourself and decidewhat you want to change in order to do a better job in life.Decide to Stop Being the Old YouWhen you can become conscious of those unconscious aspects of the old,habituated self, rooted in the operating system of the subconscious, you arebeginning the process of changing anything about yourself.What steps do you normally take when you get serious about doing somethingdifferently? You separate yourself from your external world long enough to thinkabout what to do and not do. You start becoming aware of many aspects of the oldself, and you begin to plan a course of action related to a new self.For example, if you want to become happy, the first step is to stop beingunhappy—that is, stop thinking the thoughts that make you unhappy; and stopfeeling the emotions of pain, sorrow, and bitterness. If you desire to becomewealthy, you’ll probably decide to stop doing the things that make you poor. Ifyou want to be healthy, you’ll have to stop living an unhealthy lifestyle. Theseexamples are to show you that first, you have to make the decision to stop beingthe old you, to such a degree that you make room for a new personality—thinking,acting, and doing.Therefore, if you eliminated stimuli from your external world by closing youreyes and becoming quiet (decreasing your sensory input), putting your body in astate of stillness, and no longer focusing on linear time, you could becomeaware solely of how you are thinking and feeling. And if you began to payattention to your unconscious states of mind and body and became “familiar with”your automatic, unconscious programs until they became conscious, would you bemeditating?The answer is yes. To “know thyself” is to meditate.If you are no longer being that old personality but, instead, are noticingdifferent aspects of it, wouldn’t you agree that you are the consciousnessobserving the programs of that past identity? In other words, if you consciouslyobserve the old self, you are no longer being it. As you go from being unawareto being aware, you are beginning to objectify your subjective mind. That is, byyour paying attention to the old habit of being you, your consciousparticipation begins to separate you from those unconscious programs and giveyou more control over them.By the way, if you are successful in consciously restraining those routinestates of mind and body, then “nerve cells that no longer fire together, nolonger wire together.” As you prune away the neurological hardware of the oldself, you also no longer signal the same genes in identical ways. You arebreaking the habit of being you.Contemplate a New, Greater Expression of SelfNow let’s take it one step further. Once you have become familiar with the oldself to the extent that no thought, no behavior, and no feeling will cause youto fall unconsciously into previous patterns, you might agree that it would be agood idea to begin to become familiar with a new self. Accordingly, you may askyourself, What is a greater expression of myself that I would like to be?If you turn on your frontal lobe and contemplate those aspects of self, you willbegin to make your brain work differently than your past self. As your frontallobe (the CEO) entertains that new question, it looks out over the landscape ofthe rest of the brain and seamlessly combines all of your stored knowledge andexperiences into a new model of thought. It helps create an internalrepresentation for you to begin to focus on.This contemplation process builds new neurological networks. As you ponder thefundamental question above, your neurons will begin to fire and wire in newsequences, patterns, and combinations because you are thinking differently. Andwhenever you make your brain work differently, you’re changing your mind. As youplan your actions, speculate on novel possibilities, conjure up innovative waysof being, and dream of new states of mind and body, there will be a moment thatthe frontal lobe will turn on and lower the volume to the Big Three. When thishappens, the thought(s) you are thinking will become an internal experience; youwill install new software and hardware programs into your nervous system, and itwill appear that the experience of being your new self has already been realizedin your brain. And if you repeat this process every day, your ideal will becomea familiar state of mind.One more point here. If you attend so well to the thought you are focusing onthat it literally becomes an experience, then the end product of that is anemotion. Once that emotion is created, you begin to feel like your new ideal,and that new feeling will start to become familiar. Remember that when your bodybegins to respond as if the experience is already a present reality, you willsignal your genes in new ways … and your body will commence to change now, aheadof the physical event in your life. Now you are ahead of time, and mostimportant, you move into a state of being—mind and body working together. And ifyou repeat this process consistently, this state of being will become familiarto you as well.If you can maintain that modified state of mind and body, independent of theexternal environment and the body’s emotional needs and greater than time,something should show up differently in your world. That’s the quantum law.Let’s summarize here. According to our working model of meditation, all you haveto do is remind yourself who you no longer want to “be” until this becomes sofamiliar that you know your old self—the thoughts, behaviors, and emotionsconnected to the old you that you want to change—to the extent that you “unfire”and “unwire” the old mind away and no longer signal the same genes in the sameways. Then, you repeatedly contemplate who you do want to “be.” As a result, youwill fire and wire new levels of mind, to which you will emotionally conditionthe body until they become familiar and second nature to you. That’s change.A Second Definition of Meditation:Cultivating SelfBesides its meaning in Tibetan, to meditate in Sanskrit means “to cultivateself.” I especially like this definition because of the metaphoricalpossibilities it offers—for example, gardening or agriculture. When youcultivate the soil, you take the packed-down earth that has been lying fallowfor a while and you churn it up with a spade or other implement. You expose“new” dirt and nutrients, making it easier for seeds to germinate and for tendershoots to take root. Cultivation may also require you to remove plants from theprevious season, attend to weeds that went unnoticed, and remove any rocks thatrose to the surface by natural sifting.Thus, last season’s plants might represent your past creations derived from thethoughts, actions, and emotions that define the old, familiar you. Weeds couldsignify long-standing attitudes, beliefs, or perceptions about yourself that aresubconsciously undermining your efforts, which you hadn’t noticed because youwere too distracted by other things. And the rocks can symbolize your manylayers of personal blocks and limitations (which naturally rise to the surfaceover time and block your growth). All these need tending to so you can make roomto plant a new garden in your mind. Otherwise, if you planted a new garden orcrop without proper preparation, it would yield little fruit.My hope is that you understand by now that it is impossible to create any newfuture when you are rooted in your past. You have to clear away the old vestigesof the garden (of the mind) before you can cultivate a new self by planting theseeds of new thoughts, behaviors, and emotions that create a new life.The other key thing is to ensure that this doesn’t happen haphazardly: we’re nottalking about plants in the wild, which scatter seeds roughshod over the ground,with some tiny percentage of them eventually coming to fruition. Instead, tocultivate requires making conscious decisions—when to till the soil, when toplant, what to plant, how each of the items planted will work in harmony withthe others, how much water and fertilizer to mix in, and so forth. Planning andpreparation are essential to the success of the endeavor. This requires ourdaily “mindful attention.”Similarly, when we talk about someone cultivating an interest in a particularsubject, we mean that he has thoughtfully researched that area of interest.Also, a cultivated person is someone who has carefully chosen what to exposeherself to and who has amassed a breadth of knowledge and experience. Again,none of this is done on a whim, and little is left to chance.When you cultivate anything, you are seeking to be in control. And that’s whatis required when you change any part of your self. Instead of allowing things todevelop “naturally,” you intervene and consciously take steps to reduce thelikelihood of failure. The purpose behind all of this effort is to reap aharvest. When you cultivate a new personality in meditation, the abundant yieldyou seek to create is a new reality.Creating a new mind is like cultivating a garden. The manifestations you producefrom the garden of your mind will be just like crops from the earth’s soil. Tendwell.The Meditative Process for Change:Move from the Unconscious to the ConsciousTo sum up the meditative process, you have to break the habit of being yourselfand reinvent a new self; lose your mind and create a new one; prune synapticconnections and nurture new ones; unmemorize past emotions and recondition thebody to a new mind and emotions; and let go of the past and create a new future.image [images/p209.jpg]Figure 8A. The biological model of change involves transforming the familiarpast to a new future.Let’s look a bit more closely at a few elements of this process.Obviously, to avoid letting any thought or feeling you don’t want to experienceget past you unchecked, you have to develop powerful skills of observation andfocus. We humans have a limited ability to focus and to absorb input—but we canbe much better at it than we normally are in our more unconscious state.To break the habit of being yourself, you would be wise to select one trait,propensity, or characteristic and focus your attention on that single aspect ofyour old self that you want to change. For example, you might begin by askingyourself: When I feel angry, what are my thought patterns? What do I say toothers and myself? How do I act? What other emotions spring forth from my beingangry? What does anger feel like in my body? How can I become conscious of whattriggers my anger, and how can I change my reaction?The process of change requires unlearning first, then learning. The latter is afunction of firing and wiring in the brain; the former means that circuits aretrimmed. When you stop thinking the same way, when you inhibit your habituationsand interrupt those emotional addictions, the old self begins to beneurologically pruned away.And if every connection between nerve cells constitutes a memory, then as thosecircuits are dismantled, memories of your old self will go with them. When youthink about your former life and who you used to be, it will be like anotherlifetime. Where are those memories now stored? They will be given to the soul aswisdom.When those thoughts and feelings that used to signal the body are stopped byyour conscious efforts, the liberated energy from those limited emotions isreleased into the field. You now have energy with which to design and create anew destiny.When we use meditation as a means to change, when we become conscious and aware,familiar with and willing to do what is necessary to eradicate an undesirabletrait and cultivate a desired one, we’re doing what mystics have been doing forcenturies.Although I take a clearly biological approach to change, so did the mystics.They just used different terminology to describe the process. The end result isthe same—breaking the addiction to the body, the environment, and time. Onlywhen we make that separation can we change. Only when we think greater than theBig Three can we truly live independent of them, and reestablish dominion overhow we think and feel on a daily basis.For too long, we’ve been running unconscious programs that have been controllingus. Meditation allows us to reassert control.Awareness comes first—recognizing when and how those programmed responses takeover is essential. When you move from the unconscious to the conscious, youbegin to close the gap between how you appear and who you are.The Waves of Your FutureSince knowledge is, as we’ve seen, the precursor to experience, having a basicunderstanding of what happens in the brain during meditation will serve you wellwhen you begin to learn and experience the meditative process coming up shortlyin Part III.You probably know that the brain is electrochemical in nature. When nerve cellsfire, they exchange charged elements that then produce electromagnetic fields.Because the brain’s diverse electrical activity can be measured, these effectscan provide important information about what we’re thinking, feeling, learning,dreaming, and creating and how we are processing information. The most commontechnology scientists use to record the brain’s changing electrical activity isan electroencephalograph (EEG).Research has discovered a wide scope of brain-wave frequencies in humans,ranging from the very low levels of activity found in deep sleep (Delta waves);to a twilight state between deep sleep and wakefulness (Theta); to the creative,imaginative state (Alpha); to higher frequencies seen during conscious thought(Beta waves); to the highest frequencies recorded (Gamma waves), seen inelevated states of consciousness.1 [endnotes.html#ch08_en1]To help you better understand your journey into meditation, I’m going to giveyou an overview of how each of these states relates to you. Once you know whatall of these domains are, you will be more adept at knowing when you are in thebrain-wave state where the ego tries in vain to change the ego (God knows, I’vebeen there), and when you are in the brain-wave state that is the fertile groundof true change.As children grow, the frequencies that predominate in their brains progress fromDelta to Theta to Alpha and then to Beta. Our job in meditation is to becomelike a child, moving from Beta to Alpha to Theta to (for the adept or mystic)Delta. So understanding the progression of brain-wave changes during humandevelopment can help demystify the process of how we experience meditation.Brain-Wave Development in Children:From Subconscious to Conscious MindDelta. Between birth and two years old, the human brain functions primarily inthe lowest brain-wave levels, from 0.5 to 4 cycles per second. This range ofelectromagnetic activity is known as Delta waves. Adults in deep sleep are inDelta; this explains why a newborn usually can’t remain awake for more than afew minutes at a time (and why even with their eyes open, young babies can beasleep). When one-year-olds are awake, they’re still primarily in Delta, becausethey function principally from their subconscious. Information from the outsideworld enters their brains with little editing, critical thinking, or judgmenttaking place. The thinking brain—the neocortex, or conscious mind—is operatingat very low levels at this point.Theta. From about ages two to five or six, a child begins to demonstrateslightly higher EEG patterns. These Theta-wave frequencies measure 4 to 8 cyclesper second. Children functioning in Theta tend to be trancelike and primarilyconnected to their internal world. They live in the abstract and in the realm ofimagination, and exhibit few of the nuances of critical, rational thinking.Thus, young children are likely to accept what you tell them. (P.S. Santa isreal.) At this stage, phrases such as the following have a huge impact: Big boysdon’t cry. Girls should be seen and not heard. Your sister is smarter than you.If you get cold, you’ll catch a cold. These types of statements go straight tothe subconscious mind, because these slow brain-wave states are the realm of thesubconscious (hint, hint).Alpha. Between ages five and eight, brain waves change again, to an Alphafrequency: 8 to 13 cycles per second. The analytical mind begins to form at thispoint in childhood development; children start to interpret and draw conclusionsabout the laws of external life. At the same time, the inner world ofimagination tends to be as real as the outer world of reality. Children in thisage-group typically have a foot in both worlds. That’s why they pretend so well.For instance, you may ask a child to pretend that he is a dolphin in the sea, asnowflake in the wind, or a superhero coming to the rescue, and hours later, heis still in character. Ask an adult to do the same, and well … you already knowthe answer.Beta. From ages 8 to 12 and onward, brain activity increases to even higherfrequencies. Anything above 13 cycles per second in children is the frontier forBeta waves. Beta goes on and up to varying degrees from there throughoutadulthood, and is representative of conscious, analytical thinking.After age 12, the door between the conscious mind and the subconscious mindusually closes. Beta is actually divided into low-, mid-, and high-range Betawaves. As children progress into their teens, they tend to move from low-rangeBeta up into mid-and high-range Beta waves, as seen in most adults.image [images/p214.jpg]Figure 8B. The progression of brain-wave development from Delta in infancy toBeta in adulthood. Look at the difference in the three ranges of Beta:high-range Beta can be twice as high as mid-range Beta.Brain-Wave States in Adults: An OverviewBeta. As you’re reading this chapter, most likely you are in the everyday wakingstate of Beta brain-wave activity. Your brain is processing sensory data andtrying to create meaning between your outer and inner worlds. While you areengaged in this book’s material, you may feel the weight of your body on yourseat, you may hear music in the background, you may glance up and see out awindow. All of this data is being processed by your thinking neocortex.Alpha. Now, let’s say that you close your eyes (80 percent of our sensoryinformation derives from sight) and purposefully go inward. Since you aregreatly reducing sensory data from the environment, less information is enteringyour nervous system. Your brain waves naturally slow down into the Alpha state.You relax. You become less preoccupied with the elements in your outer world,and the internal world begins to consume your attention. You tend to think andanalyze less. In Alpha, the brain is in a light meditative state (when youpractice the meditation in Part III, you’ll go into an even deeper Alpha state).On a daily basis, your brain moves into Alpha without much effort on your part.For example, when you’re learning something new in a lecture, generally yourbrain is functioning in low- to mid-range Beta. You’re listening to the messageand analyzing the concepts being presented. Then when you’ve heard enough or youparticularly like something interesting that applies to you, you naturally pauseand your brain slips into Alpha. You do this because that information is beingconsolidated in your gray matter. And as you stare into space, you are attendingto your thoughts and making them more real than the external world. The momentthat happens, your frontal lobe is now wiring that information into yourcerebral architecture … and like magic, you can remember what you just learned.Theta. In adults, Theta waves emerge in the twilight state or lucid state,during which some people find themselves half-awake and half-asleep (theconscious mind is awake, while the body is somewhat asleep). This is the statewhen a hypnotherapist can access the subconscious mind. In Theta, we are moreprogrammable because there is no veil between the conscious and subconsciousminds.Delta. For most of us, Delta waves are representative of deep sleep. In thisrealm there is very little conscious awareness, and the body is restoringitself.As this overview demonstrates, when we move into slower brain-wave states, wemove deeper into the inner world of the subconscious mind. The reverse is alsotrue: as we move into higher brain-wave states, the more we become conscious andattend to the external world.With repeated practice, these terrains of the mind will begin to become familiarto you. Just like anything else you persist at, you will come to notice whateach brain-wave pattern feels like. You’ll know when you are analyzing orthinking too much in Beta; you’ll observe when you are not present because youare swinging from the emotions of the past to trying to anticipate a knownfuture. You’ll also sense when you are in Alpha or Theta, since you’ll feel itscoherence. In time, you will know when you are there and when you are not.image [images/p217.jpg]Figure 8C. A comparison of different brain-wave patterns in adults.image [images/lin2.jpg]Gamma: The Fastest Brain Waves of All> The fastest documented brain-wave frequencies are Gamma waves, from 40 to 100> hertz.

Low-range Beta is defined as relaxed, interested attention ranging from 13 to15 hertz (cycles per second). If you are enjoying reading a book and arefamiliar with the material, your brain would probably be firing in low Beta,because you are paying a certain degree of attention without any vigilance.2. Mid-range Beta is produced during focused attention on sustained externalstimuli. Learning is a good example: if I were to test you on what you readwhile enjoying that book in low Beta, you would have to perk up a bit, and thusthere would be more neocortical activity such as analytical thinking. Mid-Betaoperates between 16 and 22 hertz.With mid-range Beta and even low-range Beta to some extent, these frequenciesreflect our conscious or rational thinking and our alertness. They are a resultof the neocortex taking in stimuli from the environment through all of oursenses and assembling the information into a package to create a level of mind.As you can imagine, with this focus on what we’re seeing, hearing, tasting,feeling, and smelling comes a great deal of complexity and activity within thebrain to produce that level of stimulation.3. High-range Beta is characterized by any brain-wave pattern from 22 to 50hertz. High-Beta patterns are observed during stressful situations where thosenasty survival chemicals are produced in the body. Maintaining this sustainedfocus in such a high-arousal state is not the type of focused attention we useto learn, create, dream, problem solve, or even heal. In truth, we could saythat the brain in high Beta is functioning with too much focused concentration.The mind is too amped up and the body is too stimulated to be in any semblanceof order. (When you’re in high Beta, just know for now that you are probablyfocusing on something too much and it’s hard to stop.)High Beta: A Short-Term Survival Mechanism, a Long-Term Source of Stress andImbalanceEmergencies always create a considerable need for increased electrical activityin the brain. Nature has gifted us with the fight-or-flight response, to help usquickly focus in potentially dangerous situations. The strong physiologicalarousal of the heart, lungs, and sympathetic nervous system leads to a dramaticchange in psychological states. Our perception, behaviors, attitudes, andemotions are all altered. This type of attention is very different from what wenormally use. It causes us to act like a revved-up animal with a big memorybank. The scales of attention become tipped toward the external environment,causing an overfocused state of mind. Anxiety, worry, anger, pain, suffering,frustration, fear, and even competitive states of mind induce high-range Betawaves to predominate during the crisis.In the short term, this serves all organisms well. There is nothing wrong withthis narrow, overfocused range of attention. We “get the job done” because itaffords us the ability to accomplish so many things.However, if we remain in “emergency mode” for a long time, high Beta knocks usfar out of balance, because maintaining it requires an immense amount ofenergy—and because this is the most reactive, unstable, and volatile of allbrain patterns. When high Beta becomes chronic and uncontrolled, the brain getsjuiced up beyond the healthy range.Unfortunately, high Beta is terribly overutilized by the majority of thepopulation. We are obsessive or compulsive, insomniac or chronically fatigued,anxious or depressed, forcibly pushing in all directions to be all-powerful orhopelessly holding on to our pain to feel utterly powerless, competing to getahead or victimized by our circumstances.Sustained High Beta Sends the Brain into DisorderTo put this into perspective, think about the normal functioning of the brain aspart of the central nervous system, which controls and coordinates all othersystems of the body: it keeps your heart beating, digests your food, regulatesyour immune system, maintains your respiratory rate, balances your hormones,controls your metabolism, and eliminates wastes, to name a few. As long as themind is coherent and orderly, messages that travel from the brain to the bodythrough the spinal cord will produce synchronized signals for a balanced,healthy body.However, many people spend their waking days in a sustained high-frequency Betastate. To them, everything is an emergency. The brain stays constantly on a veryfast cycle, which taxes the entire system. Living in this thin margin of brainwaves is like driving a car in first gear while simultaneously stepping on thegas. These people “drive through” their lives without ever stopping to considershifting gears into other brain states.Their continual repetition of survival-based thoughts creates feelings of anger,fear, sadness, anxiety, depression, competition, aggression, insecurity, andfrustration, among others. People become so caught up in these intoxicatingemotions that they try to analyze their problems from within these familiarfeelings, which only perpetuates more thoughts overfocused on survival. Also,recall that we can turn on the stress response by thought alone—the way we arethinking reinforces the very state of the brain and body, which then causes usto think the same way … and the loop goes on. It’s the serpent eating its tail.Long-term high Beta produces an unhealthy cocktail of stress chemicals, whichcan tip the brain out of balance like a symphony orchestra out of tune. Parts ofthe brain may stop coordinating effectively with other areas; entire regionswork separately and in opposition. Like a house divided against itself, thebrain no longer communicates in an organized, holistic fashion. As stresschemicals force the thinking brain/neocortex to become more segregated, we mayfunction like someone with multiple personality disorder, only we’reexperiencing it all at once instead of one personality at a time.Of course, when disorderly, incoherent signals from the brain relay erratic,mixed electrochemical messages through the central nervous system to the rest ofthe physiological systems, this puts the body out of balance, upsetting itshomeostasis or equilibrium, and setting the stage for disease.If we live in this high-stress mode of chaotic brain function for extendedperiods, the heart is impacted (leading to arrhythmias or high blood pressure),digestion begins to fail (causing indigestion, reflux, and related symptoms),and immune function weakens (resulting in colds, allergies, cancer, rheumatoidarthritis, and more).All of these consequences stem from an unbalanced nervous system that isoperating incoherently, due to the action of stress chemicals and high-rangeBeta brain waves reaffirming the outer world as the only reality.Sustained High Beta Makes It Hard toFocus on Our Inner SelfThe stress I’ve been discussing is a product of our addiction to the Big Three.The problem isn’t that we are conscious and aware, but that our focus in highBeta is almost exclusively on our environment (people, things, places), ourbodies’ parts and functions (I’m hungry … I’m too weak … I want a better nose …I’m fat compared to her …), and time (Hurry up! The clock is winding down!).In high Beta, the outer world appears to be more real than the inner world. Ourattention and conscious awareness primarily focus on everything that makes upthe external environment. Thus, we identify more readily with those materialelements: we criticize everyone we know, we judge the way our bodies look, we’reoverfocused on our problems, we cling to things we own out of fear that we mightlose them, we busy ourselves with places we have to go, and we’re preoccupiedwith time. That leaves us little processing power to pay attention to thechanges that we truly want to make—to go inward … to observe and monitor ourthoughts, behavior, and emotions.It’s difficult for us to focus on our inner reality when we are overfixating onour outer world. In general, we can’t concentrate on anything other than the BigThree, we can’t open our minds beyond the boundaries of our narrow focus, and weobsess about problems rather than thinking about solutions. Why does it takesuch effort to let go of the external and go within? The brain in high Betacan’t easily shift gears into the imaginary realm of Alpha. Our brain-wavepatterns keep us locked into all those elements of our outer world as if theyare real.When you are stuck in high Beta, it’s hard to learn: very little new informationcan enter into your nervous system that is not equal to the emotion you areexperiencing. The truth is, the problems you’re so busy analyzing can’t beresolved within the emotion you are analyzing them in. Why not? Well, youranalysis is creating higher and higher frequencies of Beta. Thinking in thismode causes your brain to overreact; you reason poorly and think withoutclarity.In view of the emotions that grip you, you’re thinking in the past—and trying topredict the next moment based on the past—and your brain can’t process thepresent moment. There’s no room for the unknown to show up in your world. You’refeeling separate from the quantum field, and can’t even entertain newpossibilities for your circumstances. Your brain isn’t in creative mode; it’sfixated on survival, preoccupied with possible worst-case scenarios. Again, notmuch information will be encoded into the system that is not equal to thatemergency state. When everything feels like a crisis, your brain makes survivalthe priority, not learning.The answer lies outside the emotions you’re wrestling with and the thoughtsyou’re overanalyzing, because they keep you connected to your past—the familiarand the known. Solving your problems begins with getting beyond those familiarfeelings and replacing your scattered focus on the Big Three with a more orderlymode of thinking.High Beta’s Incoherent SignalsProduce Scattered ThoughtsAs you can imagine, when the brain is in high Beta and you’re processing sensoryinformation—involving the environment, your body, and time—that activity cancreate a bit of chaos. Along with understanding that the electrical impulses inyour brain occur in a certain quantity (cycles per second), it’s also importantto be aware of the quality of the signal. Just as the discussion of quantumcreating showed how vital it is to send a coherent signal into the field toindicate your intended future outcome, the same coherence is essential to yourthinking and your brain waves.At any one time when you’re in the Beta range of frequencies, one of the BigThree will have more of your attention. If you’re thinking about being late,your emphasis is on time—that thought is sending a higher-frequency wave throughyour neocortex. Of course, you’re also aware of, and therefore sendingelectromagnetic impulses related to, your body and the environment. It’s justthat in the case of the latter two, you’re sending different wave patterns witha lower frequency through the neocortex.Your time-focused brain waves might look like this:image [images/p224.jpg]Your environment-focused brain waves might look like this:image [images/p244_1.jpg]Your body-focused brain waves might look like this:image [images/p244_2.jpg]Your fractured attention, caused by trying to focus simultaneously on all of theBig Three, would then produce a brain-wave pattern that might look like this:image [images/p244_3.jpg]As you can see, those three different patterns together during stress produce anincoherent signal in high-Beta mode. If you’re anything like me, you’ve hadexperiences when that last drawing represents how your thoughts felt: scattered.When we are plugged into all three dimensions—the environment, the body, andtime—the brain tries to integrate their varied frequencies and wave patterns.That takes up an enormous amount of processor time and space. If we caneliminate our focus on any one of those, the patterns that emerge will be morecoherent, and we’ll be better able to process them.image [images/p225.jpg]Figure 8D. In the first picture, the energy is orderly, organized, and rhythmic.When energy is highly synchronous and patterned, it is profoundly more powerful.The light emitted by a laser is an example of coherent waves of energy allmoving together in unison. In the second picture, the energy patterns arechaotic, disintegrated, and out of phase. An example of an incoherent, lesspowerful signal is the light from an incandescent lightbulb.Awareness, Not Analysis,Permits Entry into the SubconsciousHere is a way for you to know if you’re in Beta state: if you’re constantlyanalyzing (I call this “being in analytical mind”), you are in Beta and you’renot able to enter into the subconscious mind.The expression “paralysis by analysis” is an apt one here. Well, that’s what ishappening to us when we live most of our lives in that Beta range. The only timewe aren’t there is when we’re sleeping (then we’re in the Delta range ofbrain-wave activity).Now you might be thinking, But you said that we needed to be aware. We need tobecome familiar with our thoughts, feelings, patterns of responses, and soforth. Doesn’t that require analysis?Actually, awareness can exist outside of analysis. When you are aware, you maythink, I’m feeling angry. When you are analyzing, you go beyond that simpleobservation to add: Why is this page taking so long to load? Who designed thisstupid website? Why is it that whenever I’m in a hurry, like now when I’m tryingto get a movie listing, the Internet connection is so slow! Awareness, as I meanit to be practiced here, is simply noting (watching) a thought or feeling andmoving on.A Working Model of MeditationNow that we’ve covered some basics about brain waves in children and adults,this foundation will provide a working model (see the next five figures) to helpyou understand the meditative process.3 [endnotes.html#ch08_en3]Let’s start with Figure 8E [chap08.html#fig8e] on the next page. Thanks to theresearch into children’s brain-wave patterns, we know that when we are born, weare completely in the realm of the subconscious.image [images/p227.jpg]Figure 8E. Let this circle represent the mind. When we are born, we are totallysubconscious mind.Next, take a look at Figure 8F [chap08.html#fig8f]. Those plus and minus signsrepresent how the developing child’s mind learns from positive and negativeidentifications and associations that give rise to habits and behaviors.Here’s an example of a positive identification: When an infant is hungry oruncomfortable, she cries out, making an effort to communicate in order to gether mother’s attention. As the nurturing parent responds by feeding the child orchanging her diaper, the infant makes an important connection between her innerand outer worlds. It only takes a few repetitions before she learns to associatecrying out with being fed or becoming comfortable. It becomes a behavior.A good example of a negative association is when a two-year-old puts his fingeron a hot stove. He learns very quickly to identify the object he seesexternally—the stove—with the pain he is feeling internally, and after a fewtries, he learns a valuable lesson.image [images/p228.jpg]Figure 8F. In time, we begin to learn by association through differentinteractions between our inner world and our outer world, through our senses.In both examples, we could say that the moment the child notices an internalchemical change in the body, the brain perks up and pays attention to whateverit was in the outer environment that caused this alteration, be it pleasure orpain. These types of identifications and associations begin to slowly developmany habits, skills, and behaviors.As you learned, somewhere around the age of six or seven, as brain waves changeinto Alpha, the child begins to develop the analytical or critical mind. Formost children, the analytical mind usually finishes developing between ages 7and 12.Meditation Takes Us Beyond AnalyticalMind and into the SubconsciousIn Figure 8G [chap08.html#fig8g], the line that runs across the top of thecircle is the analytical mind, which acts as a barrier to separate the consciousfrom the subconscious mind. In adults, this critical mind loves to reason,evaluate, anticipate, forecast, compare what it knows to what it’s learning, orcontrast knowns and unknowns. For the most part, when adults are conscious,their analytical minds are always working, and thus they are functioning in somerealm of Beta waves.image [images/p229.jpg]Figure 8G. Between the ages of six and seven, the analytical mind begins toform. It acts as a barrier to separate the conscious mind from the subconsciousmind, and it usually finishes developing somewhere between 7 and 12 years old.Now take a look at Figure 8H [chap08.html#fig8h]. Above that line representingthe analytical mind is the conscious mind, which is 5 percent of the total mind.This is the seat of logic and reasoning, which contributes to our will, ourfaith, our intentions, and our creative abilities.The subconscious mind, which makes up about 95 percent of who we are, consistsof those positive and negative identifications and associations that give riseto habits and behaviors.image [images/p230.jpg]Figure 8H. The total mind is made up of 5 percent conscious mind and 95 percentsubconscious mind. The conscious mind primarily operates using logic andreasoning, which gives rise to our will, faith, creative abilities, andintentions. The subconscious mind comprises our myriad positive and negativeidentifications, which give rise to habits, behaviors, skills, beliefs, andperceptions.Figure 8I [chap08.html#fig8i] illustrates the most fundamental purpose ofmeditation (represented by the arrow): to get beyond the analytical mind. Whenwe are in this mind, we cannot truly change. We can analyze our old self, but wecannot uninstall the old programs and install new ones.Meditation opens the door between the conscious and subconscious minds. Wemeditate to enter the operating system of the subconscious, where all of thoseunwanted habits and behaviors reside, and change them to more productive modesto support us in our lives.image [images/p231.jpg]Figure 8I. One of the main purposes of meditation is to go beyond the consciousmind and enter the subconscious mind, in order to change self-destructivehabits, behaviors, beliefs, emotional reactions, attitudes, and unconsciousstates of being.Meditation Takes Us from Beta intoAlpha and Theta Brain-Wave StatesLet’s examine how you can learn to change gears and access other brain-wavestates so you can go beyond your association with the body, the environment, andtime. You can naturally slow down the high-speed vigilance of the brain and bodyinto a more relaxed, orderly, systemized pattern of brain waves.Thus, it is quite possible to consciously alter your brain waves from thathigh-frequency Beta state into Alpha and Theta (you can train yourself to moveup and down the scale of brain waves). As you do, you will open doors to truepersonal change. You trespass beyond the common type of thinking that is fueledby reactions to being in survival mode; you are entering the realm of thesubconscious mind.During meditation, you transcend the feelings of the body, are no longer at themercy of the environment, and lose track of time. You forget about you as anidentity. As you close your eyes, the input from the outside world is reduced,and your neocortex has less to think about and analyze. As a result, theanalytical mind begins to become subdued, and electrical activity in theneocortex quiets down.Then when you restfully pay attention, concentrate, and focus in a relaxedmanner, you automatically activate the frontal lobe, which reduces synapticfiring in the rest of the neocortex. Therefore, you lower the volume to thecircuits in the brain that process time and space. This allows your brain wavesto naturally slow down to Alpha. Now you are moving from a state of survivalinto a more creative state, and your brain naturally recalibrates itself to amore orderly, coherent brain-wave pattern.One of the later steps of meditation, if you keep practicing, is to move intothe Theta-wave frequency, when your body is asleep but your mind is awake. Thisis a magical land. You are now in a deeper system of the subconscious and ableto immediately change those negative associations to more positive ones.It’s important to remember that if you have conditioned the body to become themind and your body is somewhat asleep while your mind is awake, you could saythat there is no more resistance from the body-mind. In Theta, the body is nolonger in control, and you are free to dream, change subconscious programs, andfinally create from a totally unobstructed place.Once the body is no longer running the mind, the servant is no longer the masterand you are working in a realm of true power. You are like a child again,entering the kingdom of heaven.image [images/lin2.jpg]To Sleep, Perchance to Go Down,Then Up, the Ladder … Naturally> When you go to sleep, you pass though the spectrum of brain-wave states, from> Beta to Alpha to Theta to Delta.

So it is a good ideato meditate in the morning or evening, because it will be easier to slip into astate of Alpha or Theta.I like to wake up early to begin the process, because while I’m still a bitdreamy, I’m still in Alpha. I personally like to create from a clean slate.Others prefer the late evening. They know that the body (which was in controlduring the day) is now too tired to “be” the mind. They can create without anyeffort by drawing out the Alpha phase, and even entering into Theta, while theyare still awake.Meditation during the middle of the day might be difficult, especially if youwork in a busy office, manage a houseful of kids who demand your undividedattention, or are involved in activities that require heightened concentration.At such times you might be in middle to high Beta, and it may take more effortto slip through the door.image [images/P234.jpg]Figure 8J. This diagram shows how our brain-wave functions move from the highestand fastest state of activity (Beta) to the lowest and slowest (Delta). Pleasetake note that Alpha serves as the bridge between the conscious mind and thesubconscious mind. The lower/slower the brain waves, the more we are in thesubconscious mind; the higher/faster the brain waves, the more we are in theconscious mind.Taking Control of the Progression into MeditationInward contemplative practices retrain the mind, body, and brain to becomepresent, instead of being stressed in anticipation of some future event you areobsessing about. Meditation also lifts the anchor of the body-mind out of thepast and frees you from the emotions that keep you hooked to the same familiarlife.The object in meditation is to fall like a feather down from the top of abuilding, slowly and steadily. You first train yourself to let your bodyinitially relax, but keep your mind focused. Once you begin to master the skill,the ultimate goal is to let your body fall asleep while your mind stays awake oractive.Here is the progression. If waking consciousness is Beta (from low to high,depending on your levels of stress), once you sit up straight to keep your spineerect, close your eyes, take a series of conscious breaths, and go inward, youwill naturally switch from the sympathetic nervous system to the parasympatheticnervous system. You will change your physiology from the emergency protectionsystem (fight/fright/flight) to the internal protection system for long-termbuilding projects (growth and repair). As the body relaxes, your brain-wavepatterns will naturally begin to move to Alpha.If done properly, meditation will shift your brain to a more coherent andorderly wave pattern. You will go from focusing on the Big Three to becoming nobody, no thing, and no time. Now you begin to feel connected, whole, andbalanced; and you experience healthier, elevated emotions of trust, joy, andinspiration.Orchestrating for CoherenceIf our definition of mind is the brain in action or the brain’s activity when itprocesses different streams of consciousness, then meditation naturally producesmore synchronized, coherent states of mind.4 [endnotes.html#ch08_en4]On the other hand, when the brain is stressed, its electrical activity will belike an entire orchestra of musical instruments playing badly. The mind will beout of rhythm, out of balance, and out of tune.Your job is to play a masterpiece. If you persist with this band of disorderly,egocentric, self-important members who think that their individual musicalinstruments need to be heard above all others—and if you insist that they worktogether and follow your lead—there will come a moment when they will surrenderto you as their leader and will act as a team.This is the moment when brain waves become more synchronized, moving from Betainto Alpha and Theta. More individual circuits start communicating in an orderlyfashion and process a more coherent mind. Your awareness shifts fromnarrow-minded, over-focused, obsessive, compartmentalized, survival thinking tothoughts that are more open, relaxed, holistic, present, orderly, creative, andsimple. This is the natural state of being we are supposed to live by.Take a look at coherence or what is also called synchrony, the state when thebrain is working in harmony.image [images/p236.jpg]Figure 8K. In the first picture, the brain is balanced and highly integrated.Several different areas are synchronized, forming a more orderly, holisticcommunity of neural networks working together. In the second picture, this brainis disorderly and imbalanced. Many diverse compartments are no longer working asa team, and thus the brain is “dis-eased” and disintegrated.The Coherent Brain Sets the Stage for HealingThis orderly, new, synchronized signal to the body from the brain organizes allof the diverse systems into homeostasis—the cardiovascular system, digestivesystem, immune system, and so on all move into coherence as well. As the nervoussystem recalibrates itself, all of the enormous energy that was needed forsurvival can now be used for creation. The body begins to heal.For example, Jose, a man at one of my lectures, told me about one of his firsttimes doing a meditation back in his 20s. In those days, he’d had tenolive-sized warts on his left hand. He was so embarrassed by them that he oftenhid that hand in his pocket.One day someone gave Jose a book on meditation. The book instructed him tosimply focus on his breath and allow his mind to expand beyond the barriers ofhis body. One night before bed, he decided to try the process. In a matter ofmoments he went from an overfocused, contracted state to a more expanded, open,focused state. As he vacated his familiar personality and became something otherthan his typical thoughts and feelings, he went from the habitual random thoughtpatterns driven by the familiar ego to a more expanded sense of self. When thisoccurred, something shifted.The next morning when Jose woke up, all ten warts had completely vanished.Shocked and overjoyed, he looked under the sheets for evidence of them, butfound nothing. He explained that he didn’t know where the warts went. I told himthat they returned to the quantum field where they came from. I suggested to himthat the universal intelligence that keeps order in his body naturally had donewhat it always does—create more order to reflect a more coherent mind. When hisnew subjective, coherent mind matched the objective, coherent higher mind, thatgreater power within did the healing for him.All of this happened because when he got out of the way and became no body, nothing, outside time—when he forgot about himself—his focus went from sustaineddisorder to sustained order … survival to creation … contraction to expansion …incoherence to coherence. Then the unlimited consciousness restored order in hisbody, and he was healed.Meditation Plus Action: One Woman’s Path Out of LackAt my workshops, I frequently ask participants to share their surprising storiesof life changes. Monique, a therapist from Montreal, Quebec, recently describedher own remarkable experience.For most of her adult life, Monique had lived unconsciously in a near-constantstate of lack. Not enough money. Not enough energy. Not enough time to do thethings she wanted. Now she was going through a particularly rough patch: heroffice rent had risen considerably (her house couldn’t accommodate an office),she and her husband couldn’t afford to send their son to the college of hischoice, their washer needed replacing, and the shaky economy had forced severalclients to stop seeing her.One day, while doing the meditation you will learn in this book and ponderingher life choices, Monique realized that she couldn’t keep doing what shenormally did—hunker down and weather the storm with a pseudopositive,woe-is-me-but-things-could-be-worse mentality. She recognized that she’d alwaysmade decisions or sought solutions to problems from a perspective of lack—lackof time, of money, and of energy. She had memorized that state of being; lackbecame her personality. The epitome of inertia, she tended to “let the chipsfall where they may.” Ironically, Monique had worked with her clients toovercome these very traits, and to be more proactive and less reactive.With great resolve, she decided to change her personality. No longer would shelet life trample her and allow things to just happen to her.Next, Monique created a template of who she wanted to be, how she wanted tothink, and what she wanted to feel. She imagined herself as a woman who made allof her choices with an abundance of energy, time, and money. Most important, hergoal to become this person was as firm as her vision was precise. She knew whoshe no longer wanted to be; and she had definitive plans for how her new selfwould think, feel, and behave.When we make a decision that strongly and have a clear intention for what ournew reality will be like, the clarity and coherence of those thoughts producescorresponding emotions. As a result, our internal chemistry changes, ourneurological makeup is altered (we prune old synaptic connections and sprout newones), and we even express our genetic code differently.Monique began to live her life from the perspective of someone who had plenty ofmoney, who had abundant energy, and whose every need was met. She feltwonderful. Certainly, not all the problems from her catalog of worries wentaway, but she was becoming better at living from a different mind-set.Several weeks after making that firm decision, Monique was working with her lastclient of the day. This woman, who had grown up in France, reminisced how everymonth, her parents had purchased a ticket in the French lottery, a traditionthat she had continued.As Monique drove home that evening, she wasn’t thinking about the lottery. She’dnever played it, believing that with her limited financial resources, such anexpenditure was frivolous. Stopping for gas, she went inside to pay, and thereon the counter were lottery cards for various games. On impulse, recognizingthat the new Monique who lived in abundance could afford to take a chance onwinning, she purchased a ticket.By the time Monique had stopped at a local pizzeria for a carryout dinner andarrived home, the lottery had slipped her mind. Grabbing the pizza, shediscovered that some grease had soaked through the box, stuck to the lotterycard, and stained the passenger seat. She set the box on the dining table, withthe ticket alongside it. She told her family to start eating without her andthat she’d be in the garage tending to the grease stain. While she was scrubbingaway, her husband came running out.“You won’t believe it! Your lottery ticket was a winner!”Now, you’ll recall that when the quantum field responds, it does so in a waythat one couldn’t predict. Perhaps you are thinking, Of course she won millionsand lived happily ever after.Not exactly.Monique won $53,000. Was she happy? Astounded is more like it. The couple owedexactly $53,000 in credit-card and auto-loan debt.Monique relayed her excitement in telling us that story, but she slyly admittedthat next time, instead of holding the intention that all her needs were met,she’d choose to imagine they were met—and then some.image [images/circle.jpg]What Monique’s story illustrates is the power of creating a new state of being.She couldn’t do that just by imagining that she was a new person; she had to putthat new self into action. The old Monique wouldn’t have bought a lotteryticket; her new personality aligned her behavior to match her objective, and thefield responded in an entirely unexpected yet perfectly appropriate way.Because Monique developed a new personality who seized opportunities and acteddifferently, she experienced new and better results in her life. Newpersonality, new personal reality.You don’t have to win the lottery to change your life, of course. But you dohave to make the decision to stop being your old self, enter into the operatingsystem where those unconscious programs exist, and then formulate a clear designfor a new one.The Coherent Brain: Takin’ It to the StreetsBefore I wrap up this chapter, I want to bring up a subject I referenced inEvolve Your Brain—namely, Buddhist monks who were studied at the University ofWisconsin at Madison. These “super-meditators” could go into a state of coherentbrain waves well beyond what most of us are capable of. When they meditated onthoughts of loving-kindness and compassion, the coherence of the signal theywere putting out was nearly off the charts.Every morning during the study, they meditated while researchers monitored theirbrain-wave activity. After that, they were sent out onto the campus and into thetown to do what they wished—visit museums, go to shops, or what have you. Afterthey returned to the research center, they underwent brain scans again withoutfirst going back into meditation. Amazingly, despite not meditating throughoutthe day, and being subjected to the incoherent, chaotic signals that theexternal world exposes us all to, they maintained the same coherent brainpattern they had achieved in meditation.5 [endnotes.html#ch08_en5]Most of us, when faced with the profusion and confusion of stimuli that theexternal world produces, retreat into survival mode and manufacture thechemicals of stress. Those stress reactions are like disruptors that scramblethe brain’s signals. Instead, our goal is to become more like those monks. If wecan produce coherent signal patterns—those synchronous waves—every day, we’llfind that this coherence of signal manifests into something tangible.In time, if you can repeatedly create internal coherence like those monks did,you too may walk into the external environment and no longer suffer theself-limiting effects of its disruptive stimuli. And because of that, you won’texperience the knee-jerk reactions that formerly forced you to return to theold, familiar self that you are so eager to change.By persisting with meditation and creating coherence within, you will not onlyremove a lot of the negative physical conditions that plague your body, but youcan also progress toward that ideal self you’ve envisioned. Your inner coherencecan counteract negative reactionary emotional states and allow you to unmemorizethe behaviors, thoughts, and feelings that make them up.Once you’ve gotten to a neutral/empty state, it is far easier to engage aheightened one like compassion; it is easier to bring in pure joy or love orgratitude or any of the elevated emotional states. That’s true because thoseemotions are already profoundly coherent. And when you’ve moved through themeditative process and produce a brain-wave state that reflects this purity,then you will begin to overcome the body, the environment, and time, which onceproduced your self-limiting emotional states. They will no longer control you;instead, you will control them.Having Embodied Knowledge,You Are Prepared for ExperienceYou have now equipped yourself with the knowledge necessary to move on to themeditation discussed in Part III, with full understanding of what you will bedoing and why.Remember that knowledge is the forerunner to experience. All the information youhave read has been put there to prepare you for an experience. Once you learn tomeditate and apply this to your life, you should begin to see feedback. In thefollowing section you will learn how to put all of this into practice and beginto make measurable changes in any area of your life.I’m reminded of the two-stage journey that many climbers make when they ascendWashington State’s Mount Rainier, the highest volcano in the contiguous U.S.(14,410 feet). Leaving their car at the Paradise Jackson Visitor Center (5,400feet), they first trek to Camp Muir (10,080 feet). Stopping at this base campaffords them the opportunity to look back at all the ground they’ve covered,assess what they learned from the preparation and experience of that hike,receive additional practical training, and rest overnight. This overview canmake all the difference when they continue on to undertake the climb toRainier’s majestic peak.The knowledge you’ve gained has allowed you to ascend to this point. Now you’reready to apply everything you’ve learned. And your newfound wisdom shouldinspire you to forge ahead to Part III, where you can master the skills tochange your mind, and thus your life.So I invite you to pause briefly, take a look back with appreciation for theinformation you acquired in Parts I and II, and if you need to, review any areasyou may feel are important … then join me as you make your final preparation forthe meditative journey to your own personal summit.image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]PART III [toc.html#pt03]image [images/logo2.jpg]STEPPINGTOWARD YOURNEW DESTINY [toc.html#pt03]image [images/logo2.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER NINE [toc.html#ch09]image [images/line.jpg]THE MEDITATIVE PROCESS:INTRODUCTION AND PREPARATION [toc.html#ch09]As I stated earlier, the main purpose of meditating is to remove your attentionfrom the environment, your body, and the passage of time so that what youintend, what you think, becomes your focus instead of these externals. You canthen change your internal state independent of the outside world. Meditating isalso a means for you to move beyond your analytical mind so that you can accessyour subconscious mind. That’s crucial, since the subconscious is where all yourbad habits and behaviors that you want to change reside.IntroductionAll the information you have received up to this point has been intended to helpyou understand what you will be doing in this section, as you learn how to usethe meditative process to create a new reality. And once you comprehend andrepeatedly execute the “how-to” steps presented here, you can then work onanything that you want to change in your life. Remind yourself often that intaking the steps to change, you are pruning away the habit of being yourself sothat you can create a new mind for your new future. When I do the process youare about to learn, I want to lose myself in consciousness, dissociate from myknown reality, and be devoid of the thoughts and feelings that define me as theold self.In the beginning, the newness of the task you are undertaking might cause you tofeel unsettled or uncomfortable. That’s okay. It’s just your body, which hasbecome your mind, resisting the new training process. Understand this before youinitiate your discipline, and relax—each step is designed to be easy tounderstand and simple to follow. Personally, I look forward to my meditationpractice as much as anything I do. I find such order, peace, clarity, andinspiration that I rarely miss a day. It took some time for me to arrive at thisrelationship, so please be patient with yourself.Turning Small Steps into One Easy HabitWhenever you’ve learned anything new that required your full attention andcommitted practice, you probably followed specific steps during your initialinstruction. This makes it easier to break down the complexities of the skill ortask at hand so that the mind can stay focused without being overwhelmed. In anyendeavor, of course, your goal is to memorize what you’re learning so thateventually you can do it naturally, effortlessly, and subconsciously.Essentially, you want to make this new skill a habit.It’s easier to comprehend and execute any new skill when by repetition, youmaster one small task or procedure at a time and then move on to the next. Overtime you string each step together as part of one coordinated process. The signthat you’re on your way is when all the steps start to look like one easy, fluidmotion and you produce the intended result. That’s your aim in learning thismeditation as a step-by-step process.For example, in learning to hit a golf ball, there are a host of cues that yourmind has to process in order to have your actions match your intention. Imaginethat while you’re preparing to tee off for the first time, your best friendshouts, “Keep your head down! Bend your knees! Shoulders square and back erect!Keep your front arm straight, but loosen your grip! Shift your weight when youswing! Hit behind the ball, and follow through!” And my favorite: “Relax!”All these instructions at once could throw you into a state of paralysis. Whatif, instead, you worked on one thing at a time, following a methodical order? Intime, it seems logical that your swing would look like one motion.Similarly, if you were learning to cook a French recipe, you would start byfollowing its individual steps. Do that enough times, and there would come amoment when you no longer would prepare the recipe as separate steps, but as onecontinuous process. You would integrate the instructions into your body-mind,merge many steps into just a few, and eventually, cook the meal in half thetime. You’d go from thinking to doing—your body memorizes what you were doing,as well as your mind. That’s what a procedural memory is. This phenomenon occurswhen you do anything long enough. You begin to know that you know how.Building a Neural Network for MeditationRemember that the more knowledge you have, the better prepared you are for a newexperience. Every meditation step you practice will have a meaning to you basedon what you learned earlier in this book; each one is based on a scientific orphilosophical understanding so that nothing is left to conjecture. The steps arepresented in a specific order designed to help you memorize this process forpersonal change.Although I have mapped out a suggested four-week program for you to learn theentire process, please take as much time as you need to practice each step untilit becomes familiar. The best pace to set is one that is comfortable, so younever feel overwhelmed.You will begin every session by doing the previous steps you learned, thenpractice the new material for that week. Because it’s more effective to learnsome steps together, some weeks will call for you to practice two or more newsteps. Also, I recommend that you practice each new mindful step, or group ofsteps, for at least a week before you move on to the next ones. In a few weeks,you’ll build quite a neural network for meditation!Suggested Four-Week ProgramWeek One (Chapter 10): Every day, do STEP 1: Induction. Week Two (Chapter 11):Start every daily session by once again practicing the first step; then add STEP2: Recognizing, STEP 3: Admitting and Declaring, and STEP 4: Surrendering. WeekThree (Chapter 12): Start every daily session by practicing STEPS 1 through 4,then add STEP 5: Observing and Reminding and STEP 6: Redirecting. Week Four(Chapter 13): Start every daily session by practicing STEPS 1 through 6, thenadd STEP 7: Creating and Rehearsing.Please take your time and build a strong foundation. If you are already anexperienced meditator and want to do more at once, that’s fine, but work atfollowing all the instructions and committing what you will be doing to memory.When you can concentrate on what you’re doing without letting your thoughtswander to any extraneous stimuli, you will come to a point when your bodyactually aligns with your mind. Now your new skill will become easier and easierto do, thanks to Hebb’s law of firing and wiring. The ingredients of learning,attention, instruction, and practice will develop an associated neural networkto reflect your intentions.PreparationPreparing Your ToolsThe write stuff. Separately from your meditation sessions, you will read somedescriptive text about each step, often accompanied by questions and promptsunder the heading “Opportunity to Write.” I recommend that you keep a notebookhandy to write down your answers. Then review your responses before you go intoeach day’s meditation. That way, your written thoughts can serve as a road mapto prepare you to navigate through the meditative procedures in which you willaccess the operating system of your subconscious.Listen up. When you are first learning the meditation steps, you may want tolisten to prerecorded guided sessions. For example, you will learn an inductiontechnique that you will use in every one of your daily sessions, to help youreach the highly coherent Alpha brain-wave state in preparation for the approachthat is the focus of Chapters 11 to 13. In addition, the steps you are to learneach week are available for you to follow in a series of guided meditations.image [images/p224line.jpg]Two Approaches to the MeditationMeditation Option 1: Wherever you see this headphone icon …image [images/p224phone.jpg]… a guided induction or meditation is available. To listen to these guidedsessions, you can download them from www.drjoedispenza.com[http://www.drjoedispenza.com] and either play them in MP3 format or burn themonto a CD.After you read each chapter, then journal your responses in a notebook, you candownload the corresponding meditation. Each week, as you add the next step orsteps to those you practiced the previous week, you can find the next relatedmeditation available for download. They will be listed as the “Week Onemeditation,” “Week Two meditation,” “Week Three meditation,” and “Week Fourmeditation”—Week Four will include the entire meditation.For example, when you hear the Week Two meditation, it will lead you through theWeek One step—which is an induction technique—then will add the three steps youwill practice for Week Two. When you do the Week Three meditation, you willrepeat the steps you learned in Weeks One and Two, then add the steps for WeekThree.Meditation Option 2: Alternatively, scripts for these guided sessions areincluded in the Appendices so that you can read them until you memorize thesequence, or dictate them into a recording device.Appendices A and B provide two techniques for the induction. Appendix C is thescript for the entire meditation, encompassing all of the steps you will learnin Part III. If you decide to use the Appendix C script to guide yourmeditation, then each week, please start with the steps you learned in previousweeks, then build on them by doing that week’s meditation.image [images/p224line1.jpg]Preparing Your EnvironmentLocation, location, location. You have learned that overcoming your environmentis a critical step in breaking the habit of being yourself. Finding the rightenvironment in which to meditate, one with a minimum of distractions, willreally give you a leg up on defeating the first of the Big Three (we’ll coverthe other two, the body and time, in a moment). Pick a comfortable place whereyou can be alone and not be seduced by the addiction of the external world. Makeit secluded, private, and easily accessible. Go to this place every day, andmake it your special location. You will form a strong connection with thissetting. It will represent where you frequent to tame the distracted ego,overcome the old self, create a new self, and forge a new destiny. In time youwill truly look forward to being there.A participant in one event I led told me that she always fell asleep when shemeditated. Our conversation went like this:“Where do you practice your mindfulness training?”“In bed.”“What does the law of association say about your bed and sleep?”“I associate my bed with sleep.”“What does the law of repetition demonstrate about sleeping in your bed everynight?”“If I sleep in the same place nightly, I am hardwiring an association of bedwith sleep.”“Given the fact that neural networks are formed by combining the law ofassociation with the law of repetition, might you have formed a neural networkto the effect that bed means sleep? And since neural networks are automaticprograms that we unconsciously use every day, does it stand to reason that whenyou are on your bed, your body (as the mind) will tell you to automatically andunconsciously fall into oblivion?”“Yep. I guess I need a better place to meditate!”Not only did I suggest that she stay out of bed when she meditates, but that shefind a different place separate from her bedroom. When you want to build a newneural network, it makes good sense to do your mindfulness practices in asetting that represents growth, regeneration, and a new future.And please, do not see this location as a torture chamber in which you have tomeditate. This type of attitude will undermine your efforts.Preventing distractions from your environment. Make sure you won’t beinterrupted or distracted by people (a DO NOT DISTURB sign can help) or pets. Asmuch as possible, eliminate sensory stimuli that could force your mind back toyour old personality or to awareness of the external world, especially toelements of your familiar environment. Turn off your phone and computer; I knowit’s hard, but those calls, texts, tweets, IMs, and e-mails can wait. You alsodon’t want the aroma of coffee brewing or food cooking to waft into yourmeditation setting. Ensure that the room is a comfortable temperature, with nodrafts. I usually use a blindfold.Music. Music can be useful as long as you don’t play selections that will bringto mind distracting associations. If I play music, I typically use soft,relaxing, trance-inducing instrumentals or chants without lyrics. When notlistening to music, I often put in earplugs.Preparing Your BodyPosition, position, position. I sit up very straight. My back is totallyvertical, my neck is erect, my arms and legs are resting poised and still, andmy body is relaxed. What about using a recliner? Just as with sitting in bed,many people fall asleep in recliners. Sitting upright in a regular chair, limbsuncrossed, is best. If you prefer to sit on the ground and cross your legs“Indian-style,” that’s fine, too.Preventing bodily distractions. In effect, you want to “put the body away” sothat you can focus without needing to pay it any attention. For example, use therestroom. Dress in loose clothes, remove your watch, drink a little water, andhave more within reach. Take care of any hunger pangs before you begin.Head nodding vs. nodding off. Since we’re talking about the body, let me addressan issue that may come up in your own meditation practice. Although you aresitting upright, you may find your head nodding as though you are about to fallasleep. This is a good sign: you are moving into the Alpha and Theta brain-wavestates. Your body is used to lying down when your brain waves slow down. Whenyou suddenly “nod” like this, your body wants to doze off. With continuedpractice, you’ll become accustomed to your brain slowing down while you situpright. The head nodding will eventually stop, and your body won’t tend to fallasleep.Making Time to MeditateWhen to meditate. As you know, daily changes in brain chemistry result in easieraccess to the subconscious mind just after you wake up in the morning and beforeyou go to bed at night. These are the best times to meditate because you canmore readily slip into the Alpha or Theta states. I prefer to meditate aroundthe same time every morning. If you are really enthusiastic and would like tomeditate at both these times of day, go for it. However, I suggest that folksjust starting out do so once daily.How long to meditate. Take a few minutes before each day’s meditation session toreview any writing you have done in connection with the steps you are about topractice—as I said, think of these notes as your road map to the journey you areabout to take. You may also find it helpful to reread portions of the text—toremind you of what you’re about to do—before you go into meditation.While you’re learning the process, every session will start with 10 to 20minutes for induction. As you add steps, your time frame should lengthen byabout 10 to 15 minutes per step. Over time, you will move more rapidly throughthe steps with which you are already familiar. By the time you learn how to doall those in this process, your daily meditation (including induction) willgenerally take 40 to 50 minutes.If you need to finish by a certain time, set a timer to go off ten minutesbefore you must end your session. That will give you a “heads-up” to completethe session, rather than having to stop abruptly without bringing what you weredoing to a close. And set aside enough time to meditate so that the clockdoesn’t become a concern. After all, if you are meditating and find yourselfthinking about your watch, you haven’t overcome time. Essentially, you may haveto wake up earlier or go to bed later in order to carve out a slot in your day.Preparing Your State of MindMastering the ego. To be honest, I do have those days where I battle my egotooth and nail, since it wants to be in control. Some mornings as I begin theprocess, my analytical mind starts thinking about flights to catch, meetingswith staff, injured patients, reports and articles I need to write, my kids andtheir complexities, phone calls I have to make, and random thoughts from nowherethat pop into my head. I’m obsessing about everything predictable in my externallife. Typically, my mind, like most people’s, is either anticipating the futureor remembering the past. When that occurs, I have to settle down and realizethat those are all known associations that have nothing to do with creatingsomething new in the present moment. If this happens to you, it is your job togo beyond the tedium of normal thinking and enter into the creative moment.Mastering the body. If your body bucks like an unbridled stallion because itwants to be the mind—to get up and do something, think about someplace it has togo in the future, or remember a past emotional experience with some person inyour life—you must settle it down into the present moment and relax it. Everytime you do, you are reconditioning your body to a new mind, and in time, itwill acquiesce. It was conditioned by an unconscious mind, and it has to beretrained by you—so love it, work with it, and be kind to it. It will ultimatelysurrender to you as its master. Remember to be determined, persistent, excited,joyful, flexible, and inspired. When you do so, you are reaching for the hand ofthe divine.Now let’s begin….image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER TEN [toc.html#ch10]image [images/line.jpg]OPEN THE DOOR TOYOUR CREATIVE STATE(Week One) [toc.html#ch10]At an early point in my professional career, I learned about and eventuallytaught hypnosis and self-hypnosis. One of the techniques that hypnosis expertsuse to get individuals into a so-called trance is called induction. Simply put,we teach people how to change their brain waves. All someone has to do in orderto be hypnotized or to hypnotize him- or herself is to move down from high- ormid-range Beta waves into a more relaxed Alpha or Theta state. Thus, meditationand self-hypnosis are similar.I could have included induction with the preparatory information in the lastchapter, because induction prepares you to enter a coherent brain-wave statethat is conducive to meditation. By mastering induction, you will build a solidfoundation for the meditative practices you will learn in upcoming steps.However, unlike those arrangements that you will make before you begin eachday’s meditation, such as turning off your phone and putting your dog or cat inanother room, induction is a step you will include during the session—in fact,it must be the first step you master, and it will lead off every session.Just to head off any confusion, after opening each meditative session withinduction, you will not be in what the entertainment industry misleadinglydepicts as a hypnotic trance. You will be perfectly primed and able to completeall steps in the process that follows over the next three chapters.STEP 1: INDUCTION [toc.html#sec01]Induction: Open the Door to Your Creative StateI urge you to spend at least a week of daily sessions, or more if needed,devoted to practicing induction. Remember that this process will take up thefirst 20 minutes of every meditation session. You want this to become a familiarand comfortable habit, so don’t rush through it. Your objective is to “staypresent.”Preparation for induction. In addition to the aspects of preparation I discussedearlier, here are some further tips: First, sit up straight and close your eyes.As soon as you do so, blocking some sensory/environmental input from coming in,your brain waves lessen in frequency, moving toward that desirable Alpha state.Then surrender, stay present, and love yourself enough to move through thisprocess. You may find that soothing music aids in the progression from high Betato Alpha, although it isn’t necessary to use sounds.Induction techniques. There are many similar variations on induction techniques.Whether you use either the Body-Part or Water-Rising Induction, alternate themon different days, employ some other method you’ve used in the past, or devise adifferent one altogether isn’t important. What is important is that you movefrom that analytical Beta state to the sensory state of Alpha, and focus on thebody, which is the subconscious mind and the operating system, where you canthen make the changes you want.Overview: Body-Part InductionOne induction technique may at first seem contradictory—you’ll focus attentionon your body and environment. Those are two of the Big Three that you have toovercome, but in this case, you’re in control of your thoughts about them.Why is it desirable to focus on the body? Remember, it and the subconscious mindare merged. So when we become acutely aware of the body and sensations relatedto it, we enter the subconscious mind. We’re in that operating system I’vementioned often. Induction is a tool that can be used to get into that system.The cerebellum plays a role in proprioception (awareness of how our bodies arepositioned in space). So in this induction, as you rest your awareness ondifferent parts of your body in space and the space around your body in space,you’re using your cerebellum to perform this function. And since the cerebellumis the seat of the subconscious mind, as you place your consciousness on whereyour body is oriented in space, you access your sub-conscious mind and bypassyour thinking brain.Moreover, induction shuts down the analytical mind by forcing you into asensing/feeling mode. Feelings are the language of the body, which in turn isthe subconscious mind, so induction allows you to use the body’s naturallanguage to interpret and change the language of the operating system. In otherwords, if you’re sensing or putting your awareness on different aspects of yourbody, you would be thinking less, shifting your analytical thoughts from past tofuture less, and broadening your focus more to encompass a very differentscope—not narrowly obsessive, but rather, creative and open—and you would movefrom Beta to Alpha.All of this happens as you move from that narrow-minded range of attention to anexpanded focus on the body and the space around it. Buddhists refer to this asan open focus, occurring when brain waves naturally become orderly andsynchronized.1 [endnotes.html#ch10_en1] Open focus produces a new, powerfullycoherent signal that allows parts of the brain that were not communicating withother parts to now do so. That enables you to produce an extremely coherentsignal. While you can measure that on a brain scan, more important is that youcan feel the difference in the clarity and focus of your thoughts, intentions,and feelings.Body-Part Induction:The How-to*Specifically, you will focus on the location or orientation of your body inspace. For example, think about the location of your head, starting at its topand gradually moving down. As the induction progresses from body part to bodypart, sense and become aware of the space that each occupies. Also sense thedensity, the weight (or heaviness), or the volume of space that it occupies. Byfocusing your attention on your scalp, then next on your nose, then your ears,and so on, moving down the body until you’ve focused on the bottoms of yourfeet, you will notice some changes. This movement from part to part, and theemphasis on the spaces within the spaces, is the key to this.Next, become aware of the teardrop-shaped area surrounding your body, and thespace it takes up. When you can sense that area of space around your body, yourattention now is no longer on your body. Now you are not your body, butsomething grander. This is how you become less body and more mind.Finally, become aware of the area that the room you are in occupies in space.Sense the volume that it fills. When you reach this point, this is when thebrain begins to change its disorderly wave patterns to more balanced and orderlyones.The WhyWe can measure these differences in how you are thinking—we can view yourthought patterns on an EEG to see how you’ve moved from Beta- to Alpha-waveactivity. We’re not interested in just getting you into an Alpha state of anykind, though; you want to be in a highly coherent, organized Alpha. That’s whyyou will concentrate first on your body and its orientation in space, then movefrom those individual parts to the volume or perimeter of space surrounding thebody, and eventually focus your observation on the entire room. If you can sensethat density of space, if you can notice it and pay attention to it, you willnaturally move from a state of thinking to feeling. When that happens, it’simpossible to maintain the high-Beta state that characterizes the emergency modeof survival and an overfocused condition.Water-Rising Induction*Another similar induction technique you can use is to imagine water moving intothe room where you are sitting, then gradually rising. Observe (sense) the spacein which the room is situated, and the space that the water occupies. At first,the water would rise to cover your feet; move up the shins to the knees; spillover them and into your lap; move up your abdomen and chest, covering your arms,rising to your neck … up past your chin, lips, and head … until the water fillsthe entire room. While some people may not like the idea of being coveredcompletely by water, others find it soothingly warm and inviting.image [images/p224line.jpg]image [images/p224phone.jpg]WEEK ONEGUIDE TO MEDITATIONAs a reminder, during your Week One meditations, your job is to practice theinduction technique. If you record this induction yourself, make certain thatyou repeat the same questions that I have provided in my guided-inductioninstructions in the Appendices, with their emphasis on words and phrases such assense, notice, feel, become aware of, become conscious of, and attend to. Also,words such as volume, density, perimeter of space, weight of space, and so forthwill help you focus your observation.Instead of moving quickly from one part to another, allow some time to pass (agood 20 to 30 seconds or more) for those sensory inputs and the feelings ofthose parts in space to really settle in. Roughly, allow about 20 minutes to dothe Body-Part Induction from head to toe, or in the case of the water immersion,from toe to head. If you have meditated before, you will no doubt understandthat eventually you lose any sense of time passing as your brain waves diminishin frequency and you move into that calm and relaxed Alpha state where the innerworld is more real than the outer world.image [images/p224line1.jpg]_______________________--------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Condensed; see Appendix A [appendixA.html#appA] for full version.* Condensed; see Appendix B [appendixB.html#appB] for full version."},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER ELEVEN [toc.html#ch11]image [images/line.jpg]PRUNE AWAY THE HABIT OF BEING YOURSELF(Week Two) [toc.html#ch11]During Week Two, it’s time to add three steps in pruning away the habit of beingyourself: recognizing, then admitting and declaring, followed by surrendering.First, read through all these steps and answer the related questions. Thendevote at least a week to daily meditation sessions in which you first go intoinduction, then move through the three steps. Of course, if you need more thanone week to feel competent at all this, that’s fine.STEP 2: RECOGNIZING [toc.html#sec02]Recognizing: Identify the ProblemThe first move necessary in fixing anything is to understand what is presentlynot working. You have to know what the problem is and then name it in order tohave power over it.Many people who have had a near-death experience report that they underwent a“life review” in which they saw, as if watching a movie, all of their covert andovert actions, their expressed and suppressed sentiments, their public andprivate thoughts, and their conscious and unconscious attitudes. They saw whothey were and how their thoughts, words, and deeds affected everyone andeverything in their lives. Afterward, they typically describe having a greaterunderstanding about themselves and a desire to do a better job of living fromthen on. And as a result, they perceive new possibilities and better ways “tobe” in any opportunity. Having seen themselves from a truly objective point ofview, they clearly know what they want to change.Recognition is like having a life review every day. Since you have all of theequipment in your brain to notice who you are being, why not do this before youdie, and, in effect, be reborn in the same life? With practice, this type ofawareness can help you override what would otherwise be the predetermineddestiny of your brain and body—the automatic, enslaving hardwired programs ofthe mind and the memorized emotions that have chemically conditioned the body.Only when you are truly conscious and aware do you begin to wake up from thedream. To become still, quiet, patient, and relaxed, and then be attentive tothe habits of the old-personality self, disengages your subjective consciousnessfrom overutilized attitudes and extreme emotional states. You no longer are thesame mind, because you are now freeing yourself from the chains of theself-centered nature of the ego lost in itself. And when you see who you havebeen, by means of the observer’s watchful eye, you will crave life more, becauseyou will truly desire to make a greater difference the next day.As you develop the skills of contemplation and self-observation, you arecultivating the ability to separate your consciousness from the subconsciousprograms that have defined the old self. To move your consciousness from beingthe old self to being the observer of the old self loosens the connection to theold you. And as you recognize who you have been through the skill ofmetacognition (your ability via the frontal lobe to observe who you are being),for the first time your consciousness is no longer immersed in unconsciousprograms; you are becoming conscious of what was once unconscious. This ismaking the first strides toward personal change.Begin Your Own Life ReviewIn order to discover and explore aspects of the old self that you want tochange, it is necessary to pose some “frontal lobe” questions.image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WriteTake some time to ask yourself questions such as these, or any others that occurto you, and write down your answers: * What kind of person have I been? * What type of person do I present to the world? (What is one side of my “gap” like?) * What kind of person am I really like inside? (What is the other side of my “gap” like?) * Is there a feeling that I experience—even struggle with—over and over again, every day? * How would my closest friends and family describe me? * Is there something about myself that I hide from others? * What part of my personality do I need to work on * improving? * What is one thing I want to change about myself?image [images/p224line1.jpg]Choose an Emotion to UnmemorizeNext, choose one of your afflictive emotional states and limited states of mind(the following examples can help you get started)—one of the habits of beingyourself that you want to relinquish. Since memorized feelings condition thebody to be the mind, these self-limiting emotions are responsible for yourautomatic thought processes, which create your attitudes, which influence yourlimited beliefs (about self in relationship to everyone or everything), whichcontribute to your personal perceptions. Every one of the emotions listed beloworiginates from the chemicals of survival, which strengthen the ego’s control.image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WritePick one emotion that is a big part of who you are (your chosen emotion may beone that’s not listed below) and that you want to unmemorize. Remember that thisword has meaning to you because it is a feeling that is familiar to you. It isone aspect of the self that you want to change. I recommend that you write downthe emotion you came up with, because you will be working with it throughoutthis and later steps.Examples of survival emotions:InsecurityShameSadness HatredAnxietyDisgust JudgmentRegretEnvyVictimizationSufferingAger WorryFrustrationResentment GuiltFearUnworthinessDepressionGreedLackimage [images/p224line1.jpg]Most people see these examples and say, “Can I pick more than one?” It isimportant in the beginning to work with one emotion at a time. In any case, theyare all linked together neurologically and chemically. For example, have youever noticed that when you’re angry, you’re frustrated; when you’re frustrated,you hate; when you hate, you judge; when you judge, you’re envious; when you’reenvious, you’re insecure; when you’re insecure, you’re competitive; when you’recompetitive, you’re selfish? All of these emotions are run by the same combinedsurvival chemicals, which then stimulate related states of mind.On the other hand, the same is true for elevated states of mind and emotion.When you’re joyous, you love; when you love, you feel free; when you’re free,you’re inspired; when you’re inspired, you’re creative; when you’re creative,you’re adventurous … and so on. All of these feelings are driven by differentchemicals that then influence how you think and act.Let’s use anger as an example of a recurring emotion you might choose to workwith. As you unmemorize anger, all of the other self-limiting emotions willincrementally decrease within you as well. If you become less angry, you’ll beless frustrated, hateful, judgmental, envious, and so on.The good news is that you are actually taming the body to no longer rununconsciously as the mind. Consequently, as you change one of these destructiveemotional states, the body will be less prone to live out of control, and youwill change many other personality traits.Observe How the Unwanted EmotionFeels in Your BodyNext, close your eyes and think about how you feel when you experience thatparticular emotion. If you can observe yourself overcome by that emotion, payattention to how it feels in your body. There are different sensations thatcorrelate to different emotions. I want you to become aware of all of thosephysical signs. Do you become hot, irritated, jittery, weak, flushed, deflated,tight? Scan your body with your mind and notice in what area you feel thatemotion. (If you do not feel anything in your body, that’s okay; just rememberwhat you want to change about yourself. Your observation is changing it momentby moment.)Now, become familiar with your body’s present state. Does your breathing change?Do you feel impatient? Are you physically in pain, and if so, if that pain hadan emotion, what would it be? Just notice what physiologically is happening inthe moment and don’t try to run from it. Be with it. The host of differentfeelings in your body becomes an emotion when you name it as anger, fear,sadness, or whatever the case may be. So let’s get down to all of those feelingsand physical sensations that create the emotion you want to unmemorize.Allow yourself to feel that emotion without being distracted by anything oranyone. Don’t do anything or try to make it go away. Almost everything you havedone in your life has been to run from this feeling. You used everything outsideof you to try to make it go away. Be present with your emotion and feel it asenergy in your body.This emotion has motivated you to appropriate everything you know in yourenvironment to fashion an identity. Because of this feeling, you created anideal for the world instead of an ideal for yourself.This feeling is who you really are. Acknowledge it. It is one of the many masksof your personality that you have memorized. It started from an emotionalreaction to an event in your life, which lingered into a mood, which developedinto a temperament, which created your personality. This emotion has become thememory of yourself. It speaks nothing about your future. Your attachment to itmeans that you are mentally and physically bound by your past.If emotions are the end product of experiences, then by embracing the sameemotion every day, the body is being fooled into believing that your externalworld is staying the same. And if your body is being conditioned to reexperiencethe same circumstances in your environment, you can never evolve and change. Aslong as you live by this emotion daily, you can only think in the past.Define the State of MindAssociated with the EmotionNext, ask yourself this simple question: “How do I think when I feel this way?”Let’s say that you want to change anger as one of your personality traits. Askyourself, “What is my attitude when I feel anger?” The answer might becontrolling or hateful, or it might be self-important. By the same means, if youwant to overcome fear, you might have to address the state of mind of feelingoverwhelmed, anxious, or desperate. Suffering might lead to feeling victimized,depressed, lazy, resentful, or needy.Now, become aware of or remember your thinking when you feel this way. What isthe state of mind that is powered by this emotion? This feeling influenceseverything you do. States of mind represent an attitude that is driven by thememorized feelings subconsciously anchored in the body. An attitude is a seriesof thoughts that are connected to a feeling, or vice versa. It is the repetitivecycle of thinking and feeling, feeling and thinking. Therefore, you need todefine your neural habit that is influenced by your particular emotionaladdiction.image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WriteBecome aware of how you think (your state of mind) when you are feeling theemotion you want to change. You may pick from the list below, or add any thatare not listed. Your selection will be based on the unwanted emotion youidentified previously, but it’s natural to be in one or more limiting states ofmind relating to that emotion. So write down one or two that resonate with you,because you will work with these in upcoming steps.Examples of limiting states of mind:CompetitiveLackingControlling OverwhelmedOverly intellectualDeceptiveComplainingSelf-importantConceited BlamingShy/timid/introvertedDramaticConfusedNeeding recognitionRushing DistractedUnder-/overconfidentNeedySelf-pityingLazySelf-involved DesperateDishonestSensitive/insensitiveMost of your behaviors, choices, and deeds are equal to this feeling. Therefore,you will think and act in predictable, routine ways. There can be no new future,just more of the same past. It’s time to remove the colored lenses and no longersee life through a filter of the past. Your job is to be with that emotionalattitude without doing anything but observing it.image [images/p224line1.jpg]You’ve just identified an unwanted emotion and its corresponding state of mindthat you want to unmemorize. But remember that you still have a couple of stepsto read through before you integrate them all into your daily meditation….STEP 3: ADMITTING AND DECLARING [toc.html#sec03]Admitting: Acknowledge Your True SelfRather Than the Self You Show to Other PeopleAllowing yourself to be vulnerable, you move beyond the realm of your senses andbegin to introduce yourself to the universal consciousness that is the giver ofyour life. You develop a relationship with this greater intelligence, telling itwho you have been and what you want to change about yourself, and admitting whatyou have been hiding.Owning up to who we really are and what our past mistakes have been and askingto be accepted are among the most challenging things for us to do as humans.Think of how you felt as a child when you had to fess up to your parents, ateacher, or a friend. Have those feelings of guilt, shame, and anger changed nowthat you’re an adult? Most likely you still experience them, but maybe not asstrongly.What makes achieving Step 3 possible is knowing that we are admitting our faultsand failures to our higher power and not to another similarly flawed human. As aresult, when we admit to ourselves and to that universal power, there is:No punishmentNo judgmentNo manipulationNo emotional abandonmentNo blameNo scorekeepingNo rejectionNo loss of loveNo damnationNo separationNo banishmentAll of the preceding acts are derived from the old paradigm of God, which hasbeen shrunk to the likeness of an insecure man, completely self-absorbed,steeped in the concepts of good and bad, right and wrong, positive and negative,success and failure, love and hate, heaven and hell, pain and pleasure, and fearand more fear. This traditional model must be addressed, because one must enterthis consciousness with a new consciousness.This enigma can be called innate intelligence, chi, divine mind, spirit, thequantum, the life force, infinite mind, the observer, universal intelligence,the quantum field, invisible power, mother-father life, cosmic energy, or higherpower. Regardless of what name you give it, you must see this energy as anunlimited source of power within you and around you, which you utilize andcreate from throughout your life.It is the consciousness of intent and the energy of unconditional love. It isimpossible for it to judge, punish, threaten, or banish anyone or anythingbecause it would be doing those very things to itself.It only gives in love, compassion, and understanding. It already knowseverything about you (it’s you who has to make an effort to know and develop arelationship with it). It has been observing you from the moment you werecreated. You are an extension of it.It only waits in hope, in admiration, and in patience … it only wants you to behappy. And if you are happy being unhappy, that’s fine, too. That’s how much itloves you.This self-organizing invisible field is wise beyond comprehension because itexists through an interconnected matrix of energy that extends in all dimensionsin space and time, past, present, and future. It records the thoughts, desires,dreams, experiences, wisdom, evolution, and knowledge from all of eternity. Itis an immense, immaterial, multidimensional field of information. It “knows”much more than you and I do (even though we think we know it all). Its energycan be likened to many levels of frequency; and like radio waves, everyfrequency carries information. All of life on a molecular level vibrates,breathes, dances, shimmers, and is alive; it is completely receptive andmalleable to our willful intentions.Let’s suppose you want joy in your life. So you ask the universe for it everyday. However, you’ve memorized suffering into such a state of being that youwhine all day long, you hold everyone responsible for the way you feel, you makeexcuses for yourself, and you mope around constantly feeling sorry for yourself.Can you see that you can declare joy all you want, but you are demonstratingbeing a victim? Your mind and body are in opposition. You are thinking a certainway one moment; then you are being something else the remainder of the day.Hence, can you humbly and sincerely admit who you have been, what you have beenhiding, and what you want to change about yourself, so that you eliminateunnecessary pain and suffering before you create the related experiences in yourreality? To vacate and lay down your familiar personality for a brief period oftime and knock on the door of the infinite in a state of joy and reverence is somuch more conducive to change than allowing your personality to be fractured byyour insistent course of destiny, created by who you were repeatedly “being.”Let’s change in joy instead of changing in pain.image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WriteNow, close your eyes and become still. Look into the vastness of this mind (andinto yourself) and begin to tell it who you have been. Develop a relationshipwith the greater consciousness that is giving you life, by honestly and inwardlytalking to it. Share with it the details of those stories that you have carriedaround with you. Writing down what comes to you will be useful in later steps.Examples of what you might admitto your higher power: * I am afraid of falling in love because it hurts too much. * I pretend I am happy, but I am really suffering because I am lonely. * I do not want anyone to know that I feel so guilty, so I lie about myself. * I lie to people so that they like me and so I won’t feel so unloved and unworthy. * I can’t stop feeling self-pity. I think, act, and feel this way all day long because I do not know how else I can feel. * I have felt like a failure most of my life, so I try extra hard to be a success.Now, take a moment and review what you have written and what you want to admitto this power.image [images/p224line1.jpg]Declaring: Outwardly AcknowledgeYour Self-Limiting EmotionIn this part of the meditation process, you actually speak out loud who you havebeen and what you have been hiding about yourself. You tell the truth aboutself, put the past to rest, and close the gap between how you appear and who youreally are. You give up your façade and the constant effort of being someoneelse. By declaring the truth about yourself out loud, you are breaking theemotional ties, agreements, dependencies, attachments, bonds, and addictions toall those external cues in your life.In the workshops that I conduct around the world, this is the most difficultpart of the steps. No one really wants anyone to know who they really are. Theywant to maintain how they appear. However, as you have learned, it takes anenormous amount of energy to keep up this ongoing image. This is the point whereyou want to release that energy.And remember: since emotions are energy in motion, everything that you’veexperienced and interacted with in your external life has an energetic emotionattached to it. Essentially, you are bonded to some person, thing, or place byan energy that exists beyond time and space. This is how you continuallyremember yourself as an ego with a personality, identifying emotionally with andbeing tied to everything in your life.For example, if you hate someone, that hate keeps you emotionally attached tothe other person. Your emotional bond is the energy that keeps this individualin your life so that you can feel hate and thus reinforce one aspect of yourpersonality. In other words, you use that person to stay addicted to hatred. Bythe way, it should be obvious by now that your hatred is primarily hurting you.As you release chemicals from your brain to your body, you truly hate yourself.To speak the truth about yourself out loud in this step empowers you to becomefree from hatred and less connected to the person or thing in your externalreality that reminds you of who you have been.If you recall the gap discussed earlier, you know that most people rely on theenvironment to remember themselves as a “somebody.” Therefore, if you havememorized an emotion as part of your personality and you are addicted to it,then when you declare who you have been emotionally, you are calling energy back(releasing it) to you from your emotional bonds with everything and everyone inyour life. This conscious statement by you will free you from the old self.In addition, by claiming your limitations and consciously revealing what youhave been hiding, you are freeing the body from being the mind; and for thatreason, you are closing the gap between how you appear and who you really are.When you verbalize who you have been, you also liberate energy stored in yourbody. This will become “free energy” for you to use later on in the meditationto create a new self and life.Bear in mind that your body will not want to do this very readily. Your egoautomatically hides this emotion because it doesn’t want anyone to know thetruth about itself. It wants to remain in control. The servant has become themaster. But the master now must let the servant know that he or she has beendelinquent, unconscious, and absent. So it makes sense that your body will notwant to relinquish control, because it does not trust you. But if you just openyour mouth and speak out in spite of the body’s control, it will begin to feellighter and relieved, and you will begin to be back in command.This is how you define who you really are without any associations to yourexternal environment. You are severing your energetic bond to the emotionalattachment of all of the elements in the outer world. If admitting is an inneracknowledgment, then declaration is an outward one.What Is It That You Want to Declare?It’s time to merge this part of Step 3 with the previous part. Remember thatyou’re building this section into one fluid process. Using the example of anger,you might say aloud, “I have been an angry person my whole life.”Remember the general aim of what you want to declare. In this part of yourmeditation for the week, while you are sitting up with eyes closed, you’ll openyour mouth and softly say the emotion that you are declaring: anger.While you prepare yourself to do this and while you are engaged in verbalizingyour declaration, it probably will not feel good to you. Do it anyway; that’syour body talking to you.Your end result is that you are inspired, uplifted, and energized. Make thisstep simple, easy, and lighthearted. Do not overanalyze what you have done. Justknow that the truth shall set you free.image [images/circle.jpg]Remember that you’re not ready to start your Week Two meditations yet. In thissection, you’ve recognized an unwanted emotion and its corresponding state ofmind that you want to unmemorize, then you admitted it inwardly and declared itoutwardly. There’s one more step to read, after which you can put all fourtogether in your Week Two meditation….STEP 4: SURRENDERING [toc.html#sec04]Surrendering: Yield to a Greater Power andAllow It to Resolve Your Limitations or BlocksSurrendering is the final step in this section, in which you are pruning awaythe habit of being yourself.Most of us struggle with the idea of letting go, of allowing someone orsomething else to have control. Keeping in mind whom you are surrendering to—theSource, Infinite Wisdom—should make this process go much easier.Einstein said that no problem could be solved from the same level ofconsciousness that created it. The limited state of mind of your personality isresponsible for creating your limitations, and the answer has not come to you …so why not go to a grander, more resourceful consciousness to help you overcomethis facet of yourself? Since all potentials exist in this infinite sea ofpossibilities, you are humbly asking it to take your limitations from you in adifferent way than the mode in which you have been trying to resolve this issue.Since the best way to transform yourself has not occurred to you and what youhave been doing up to this point to overcome the problems in your life has notworked out yet, it’s time to contact a greater resource.The consciousness of the ego could never see the solution. It is steeped in theemotional energy of the dilemma; and therefore it only thinks, acts, and feelsequal to that mind. It only creates more of the same.Your change will be executed in a way that is unlimited from the objectivemind’s perspective. It sees you from the perspective of not being you. Itperceives potentials that you have not even thought of because you were too busybeing lost in the dream by responding to life in predictable ways.However, if you say that you have surrendered to the objective consciousness’sassistance yet still try to do things your own way, can you see that it isimpossible for it to assist you in changing anything in your life? By your ownfree will, you would thwart its efforts.Most of us obstruct this mind because we go back to trying to resolve ourproblems by living within the same unconscious, habitual lifestyle. We get inour own way. In fact, most of us wait until the ego is driven into the ground tothe point that we can no longer continue “business as usual.” This is when weusually surrender and receive some type of aid.You can’t both surrender and try to control the outcome. Surrender requires thatyou give up what you think you know from your limited mind, especially yourbelief about how this problem in your life should be taken care of. To trulysurrender is to let go of the ego’s control; trust in an outcome that youhaven’t thought of yet; and allow this all-knowing, loving intelligence to takeover and provide the best solution for you. You must come to the understandingthat this invisible power is real, is fully conscious of you, and can completelytake care of any aspect of the personality. When you do, it will organize yourlife in a way that is just right for you.When you ask for help by simply releasing to a greater mind the emotion you haveadmitted and declared, you won’t have to: * Bargain * Beg * Make deals or promises * Commit halfway * Manipulate * Weasel * Ask for forgiveness * Feel guilty or shameful * Live with regrets * Suffer from fear * Provide excusesMoreover, you won’t have to give your higher mind conditions like “You should …”and “It would be better if …” You can’t tell this unlimited grand essence how togo about anything. If you do, you are back to trying to do things your way, andnaturally it will stop helping you so as to allow you your free will. Instead,can your free will be “Thy will be done”?Just surrender in … * Sincerity * Humility * Honesty * Certainty * Clarity * Passion * Trust… and then get out of the way.Joyously give up the emotion you want to let go of to a more expanded mind, andknow that it will do this for you. When your will matches its will, when yourmind matches its mind, and when your love of self matches its love for you … itanswers the call.The side effects of surrendering include: * Inspiration * Joy * Love * Freedom * Awe * Gratitude * ExuberanceWhen you feel joy or live in a state of joy, you have already accepted thefuture outcome that you want as a reality. When you live as if your prayers havealready been answered, this greater mind can do what it does best by organizingyour life in new and unusual ways.What if you knew that some issue facing you had been completely taken care of?What if you were certain that something exciting or great was about to happen toyou? If you knew it without a doubt, there would be no worry, no sadness, nofear, and no stress. You would be lifted. You would be looking forward to yourfuture.If I told you that I was taking you to Hawaii in a week and you knew that I wasserious, wouldn’t you start to get happy in anticipation? Your body would beginto physiologically respond ahead of the actual experience. Well, the quantummind is like a big mirror—it reflects back to you what you accept and believe astrue. So your outer world is a reflection of your inner reality. The mostimportant synaptic connection you can make when it comes to this mind is to knowthat it is real.Think about how a placebo works. You know by now that we have three brains thatallow us to evolve from thinking to doing to being. Often subjects with healthissues who are given a sugar pill that they think is medicine accept the thoughtthat they are going to get better, begin to act as if they are better, begin tofeel better, and finally are being better. And as a result, the subconsciousmind within them, which is connected to the universal mind all around them,begins to change their internal chemistry to mirror their new belief about theirrestored health. The same principle applies here. Believe that the quantum mindwill answer your call and help you.If you begin to doubt, become anxious, worry, get discouraged, or overanalyzehow this assistance might happen, you have undone everything that you originallyaccomplished. You got in your own way. You blocked something greater fromhelping you. Your emotions demonstrated that you disbelieved in quantumpossibilities, and therefore you lost your connection to the future that thedivine mind was orchestrating for you.This is when you have to go back and reinstate a more powerful frame of mind.Talk to the quantum mind as if it knows you very well and loves and cares foryou … because it does.image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WriteIn anticipation of this conversation, write down some things you would like tosay in your surrender statement.> Examples of surrender statements:> > Universal mind within me, I forgive my worries, my anxieties, and my> small-minded concerns, and I give them to you. I trust that you have the mind> to resolve them much better than I could. Arrange the players in my world so> that doors open for me.> > Innate intelligence, I release my suffering and my self-pity to you. I have> mismanaged my inner thoughts and actions for long enough. I allow you to> intervene and provide a greater life in a way that is just right for me.image [images/p224line1.jpg]Prepare to surrender. Now close your eyes, and begin to become familiar withwhat you want to say to this greater mind. Review what you have written so thatyou can take your limitations to it. The more present you are, the more focusedyou can become. As you begin to inwardly recite your prayer, remember that thisinvisible consciousness is watchful and aware of you; it notices everything thatyou think, do, and feel.Ask for help, and turn over your unwanted state of mind. Next, ask the universalconsciousness to take this part of you and reorganize it into something greater.Once you do, then hand it over to this higher mind. Some people mentally open adoor and pass it through, others hand it over in a note, while some place it ina beautiful box, then let it dissolve into the higher mind. It doesn’t matterwhat you imagine. I just simply let it go.What matters is your intention—that you feel connected to a very loving,universal consciousness, and that you begin to become free from your old selfwith its help. The more purposefully you are able to manage your thoughts andthe more you can feel the joy of being free from this condition, the more youare matching a greater will, its mind, and its love.Give thanks. Once you have completed your prayer, remember to give thanks aheadof the manifestation. When you do, you are sending a signal into the quantumfield that your intention has already come to fruition. Thankfulness is thesupreme state of receivership.image [images/p224line.jpg]image [images/p224phone.jpg]WEEK TWOGUIDE TO MEDITATIONNow you’re ready to do your Week Two meditation. Here’s a suggested way to movethrough all the steps you’ve learned. If you feel that you already did any ofthese actions while you were reading and journaling, just go ahead and repeatthem during your meditations. You may be surprised by the results. * Step 1: First, go through your induction technique and continue to become more and more used to this process to enter the subconscious mind. * Step 2: Next, by becoming aware of what you want to change about yourself in mind and body, “recognize” your own limitations. That is, define a specific emotion that you want to unmemorize and look at the associated attitude that is driven by that feeling. * Step 3: Continuing on, inwardly “admit” to a higher power within you who you have been, what you want to change about yourself, and what you have been hiding. Then, outwardly “declare” what emotion you are releasing so as to free the body from the mind and break the bonds to the elements in your environment. * Step 4: Finally, “surrender” this self-limiting state to a greater mind and ask that it be resolved in a way that is right for you.Practice these individual steps regularly during your sessions, until they beginto become so familiar to you that they merge into one smooth step. Then you willbe ready to proceed on.Keep in mind that as you continue to add steps to your meditation process, youwill always start by doing the series of four intentional actions you justlearned.image [images/p224line1.jpg]image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER TWELVE [toc.html#ch12]image [images/line.jpg]DISMANTLE THE MEMORY OF THE OLD YOU(Week Three) [toc.html#ch12]Once again, you will read through and perform your writing on Steps 5 and 6before you do your Week Three meditation sessions.STEP 5: OBSERVING AND REMINDING [toc.html#sec05]In this step, you observe the old self and remind yourself who you no longerwant to be.Just like our working definition of meditation in Part II of the book, toobserve and remember is to become familiar with; to cultivate the “self”; and tomake known what is, in some way, unknown. Here you will become completelyconscious of (by observing) the specific unconscious or habitual thoughts andactions that make up that state of mind and body that you named earlier, in Step2: Recognizing. Then you will remind yourself about (by remembering) all of theaspects of the old self that you no longer want to be. You will become familiarwith yourself “being” the old personality—the precise thoughts you no longerwant to give power to, and the exact behaviors you no longer want to engagein—so you never fall back into being the old self. This frees you from the past.What you mentally rehearse and what you physically demonstrate is who you are ona neurological level. The “neurological you” is made up of the combination ofyour thinking and actions on a moment-to-moment basis.This step is designed to create greater awareness and a better observation ofwho you have been (metacognition). As you reflect and review your old self, youwill get clear on who you no longer want to be.Observing: Become Conscious of YourHabitual States of MindIn Step 2: Recognizing, you have already observed the emotion that drives you.Now I want you to become so familiar with your specific thoughts and actionsderived from the old sensations that you can catch yourself while you live yourlife. With repeated practice, you can become so aware of the old patterns thatyou never allow them to manifest to fruition. The end result is that you stayahead of the old self so that you have control over it. So when you start tonotice the beginnings of the feeling that normally drives your unconsciousthoughts and habits unfolding in your day, it has become so familiar to you thatthe slightest inkling is now brought to your awareness.As an example, if you are overcoming a dependency on some substance such assugar or tobacco, the more you are able to sense when the pangs and tugs of thebody’s chemical addiction begin, the sooner you will be able to do battleagainst them. Everyone knows when the cravings start to occur. You begin tonotice impulses, urges, and sometimes loud screams, which sound like, “Just doit! Submit! Give in! Go ahead—just this one time!” As you continuously forgeonward and upward, in time you can notice when these cravings come up, and youwill be better equipped to handle them.The same is true with personal change, except the substance is not somethingthat exists outside of you. In reality, it is you. Your feelings and thoughtsare actually a part of you. Nevertheless, your real objective here is to be soaware of the self-limiting state of being that you would never let one thoughtor behavior go unnoticed by you.Almost all of what we demonstrate starts with a thought. But just because youhave a thought doesn’t necessarily mean it is true. Most thoughts are just oldcircuits in your brain that have become hardwired by your repetitive volition.Thus, you have to ask yourself, “Is this thought true, or is it just what Ithink and believe while I am feeling this way? If I act on this impulse, will itlead me to the same result in my life?” The truth is, these are echoes from yourpast that are connected to strong feelings, which activate old circuits in yourbrain and cause you to react in predictable ways.image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WriteWhat automatic thoughts do you think when you feel that emotion you identifiedin Step 2? It is important to write them down and memorize the list. To help yourecognize your own unique set of self-limiting thoughts, you may find thefollowing examples helpful.Examples of limiting automatic thoughts(your daily, unconscious mental rehearsal): * I’ll never get a new job. * No one ever listens to me. * He always makes me feel angry. * Everyone uses me. * I want to call it quits. * Today is a bad day for me, so why bother trying to change it. * It’s her fault that my life is this way. * I’m really not that smart. * I honestly can’t change. Maybe it would be better to start another time. * I don’t feel like it. * My life sucks. * I hate my situation with ________. * I’ll never make a difference. I can’t. * ________does not like me. * I have to work harder than most people. * It’s my genetics. I am just like my mother.image [images/p224line1.jpg]Just as with habitual thoughts, habitual actions also make up your own uniqueundesirable states of mind. You are influenced to behave in memorized ways bythe very emotion that has conditioned your body to be your mind. This is who youare when you go unconscious. You start off with good intentions, and then youfind yourself sitting on the couch eating potato chips with the remote controlin one hand and a cigarette in the other. However, just a few hours before, youproclaimed that you were going to get in shape and stop all self-destructivebehaviors.Most unconscious actions are taken to emotionally reinforce the personality andfulfill an addiction, in order to feel more of the same way. For example, peoplewho feel guilty on a daily basis will have to perform certain actions to fulfilltheir emotional destiny. Most certainly, they will get in trouble in life tofeel more guilt. Many unconscious actions match and thus satisfy who we areemotionally.On the other hand, many people exhibit certain habits in order to temporarilymake the feeling they have memorized go away. They look for instantgratification from something outside of them to momentarily free them from theirpain and emptiness. Being addicted to computer games, drugs, alcohol, food,gambling, or shopping is used to resolve one’s inner pain and emptiness.Your addictions create your habits. Since nothing that exists outside of youcould ever resolve your emptiness on a permanent basis, invariably you will haveto do more of the same activity over again. After the thrill or the rush wearsoff a few hours later, you will have to return to the same addictive tendencyonce more, but do it longer. However, when you unmemorize the negative emotionof your personality, you eliminate the destructive unconscious behavior.image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WriteThink about the unwanted emotion you identified. How do you habitually act whenyou are feeling this way? You may recognize your own patterns among the examplesbelow, but be sure to add those behaviors that are specific to you. Now, writedown the unique ways you behave when you feel that emotion.Examples of limiting actions/behaviors(your daily, unconscious physical rehearsal): * Sulking * Feeling sorry for yourself by sitting alone * Eating away depression * Calling someone to complain about how you feel * Playing obsessively on the computer * Picking a fight with someone you love * Drinking too much and making a fool out of yourself * Shopping and spending more than you have * Procrastinating * Gossiping or spreading rumors * Lying about yourself * Throwing a temper tantrum * Treating fellow employees with disrespect * Flirting with other people when you are married * Bragging * Yelling at everyone * Gambling too much * Driving aggressively * Trying to be the center of attention * Sleeping in every day * Talking too much about the pastIf you are having difficulty coming up with answers, ask yourself what you thinkabout during various situations in your life, and inwardly “watch” how you thinkand respond. You can also inwardly “look through the eyes” of other people. Howwould they say they see you? How do you act?image [images/p224line1.jpg]Reminding: Recall the Aspects of the Old SelfYou No Longer Want to BeNow review and memorize your list. This is an essential part of meditation. Yourgoal is “to become familiar with” how you think and act when this specificemotion is driving you. It is to remind you how you no longer want to be, andhow you were making yourself so unhappy. This step helps you become aware of howyou unconsciously behave and what you say to yourself while you’re thinking andfeeling, feeling and thinking, so that you have more conscious control in yourwaking day.Executing this step is a work in progress. In other words, if you sit down everyday for a week to focus on this, you will probably find that you continue tomodify and refine your list. That’s good.When you do this step, you enter the operating system of the “computer” programsin the subconscious mind and throw the spotlight on them for your review. Youultimately want to become so familiar with these cognitions that you inhibitthem from firing in the first place. You will prune away the synapticconnections that made up the old self. And if everywhere that a neurologicalconnection is formed constitutes a memory, then you are in fact dismantling thememory of the old you.Throughout this next week, continue to review the list again so that you knoweven better who you no longer want to be. If you can memorize all these aspectsof the old self, you will separate your consciousness even further from the oldself. When your habitual, automatic thoughts and reactions are completelyfamiliar to you, they will never slip by unnoticed or unrecognized. And you willbe able to anticipate them before they are initiated. This is when you are free.In this step, remember: awareness is your goal.image [images/circle.jpg]You know the drill by now … read Step 6 and do your writing; then you’ll beready to start your Week Three meditations.STEP 6: REDIRECTING [toc.html#sec06]Here’s what happens when you use the tools of redirecting: You prevent yourselffrom behaving unconsciously. You stop yourself from activating your oldprograms, and you biologically change, causing unfiring and unwiring of nervecells. Similarly, you stop the same genes from being signaled in the same ways.If you’ve struggled with the idea of surrendering control, this step allows youto more consciously and judiciously take back the reins in order to break thehabit of being yourself. When you become masterful at being able to redirectyourself, you’re building a solid foundation on which to create yournew-and-improved self.Redirecting: Play the Change GameDuring your meditations this week, take some of the situations you came up within the step just before, and as you picture them or observe yourself in yourmind, tell yourself (out loud), “Change!” It’s simple: 1. Imagine a situation where you are thinking and feeling in an unconscious way. … Say “Change!” 2. Become aware of a scenario (with a person, for example, or a thing) where you could easily fall into an old behavior pattern. … Say “Change!” 3. Picture yourself in an event in your life where there is a good reason to fall short of your ideal. … Say “Change!”The Loudest Voice in Your HeadAfter you remind yourself to stay conscious throughout your day, as you learnedin the previous step, you can now use a tool to change right in the moment.Whenever you catch yourself in real life thinking a limiting thought or engagingin a limiting behavior, just say “Change!” out loud. Over time, your own voicewill become the new voice in your head—and the loudest one. It will become thevoice of redirection.As you repeatedly interrupt the old program, your efforts will begin to furtherweaken the connections between those neural networks that make up yourpersonality. By the principle of Hebbian learning, you will unhook the circuitsconnected to the old self during your daily life. At the same time, you are nolonger epigenetically signaling the same genes in the same ways. This is anotherstep so that you will become more conscious. It is developing “consciouscontrol” of yourself.When you can stop a knee-jerk emotional reaction to some thing or person in yourlife, you are choosing to save yourself from returning to the old you thatthinks and acts in such limited ways. By the same idea, as you gain consciouscontrol over your thoughts that may be initiated from some stray memory orassociation connected with some environmental cue, you will move away from thepredictable destiny in which you think the same thoughts and perform the sameactions, which will create the same reality. It is a reminder placed by you inyour own mind.As you become aware, redirect your familiar thoughts and feelings, and recognizeyour unconscious states of being, you are also no longer using up your valuableenergy. When you are living in a state of survival, you are signaling your bodyinto emergency status by knocking it out of homeostasis and thus mobilizing alot of energy. Those emotions and thoughts represent a low frequency of energythat is consumed by the body. So when you are conscious and change them beforethey make it to the body, then every time you notice or redirect them, you areconserving vital energy you may use for creating a new life.Associative Memories Trigger Automatic ResponsesSince staying conscious is crucial to creating that new life, it is important tounderstand how associative memories have made it so difficult for you to stayconscious in the past, and how practicing redirection can help free you fromyour old self.Earlier in this book, we saw that Pavlov’s classical-conditioning experimentwith dogs beautifully illustrates why it can be so hard for us to change. Thedogs’ reaction in that experiment—learning to salivate in response to a bell—isan example of a conditioned response based on an associative memory.Your associative memories exist in the subconscious mind. They are formed overtime when the repeated exposure to an external condition produces an automaticinternal response in the body, which then elicits an automatic behavior. As oneor two of the senses respond to the same cue, the body reacts without much ofthe conscious mind’s involvement. It turns on by a thought or a memory alone.By the same token, we live by numerous similar associative memories in ourlives, triggered by so many known identifications derived from our environment.For instance, if you see someone you know well, chances are that you are goingto respond in automatic ways without ever consciously knowing it. Seeing thatindividual will create an associated memory from some past experience that isconnected to some emotion, which then triggers an automatic behavior. Thechemistry of your body changes the moment you “think” about him or her in thepast memory. A program runs from the repeated conditioning that you memorizedabout that person into your subconscious mind. And just like Pavlov’s dogs, inmoments you are physiologically responding unconsciously. Your body takes overand begins to run you subconsciously, based on some past memory.Your body is now predominantly in control. You’re out of the driver’s seatconsciously because your subconscious body-mind is now controlling you. What arethe cues that cause this to occur so quickly with you? They can be anything oreverything in your external world. Their source is your relationship to yourknown environment; it is your life, which is connected to all of the people andthings you experienced at different times and places.This is why it is so difficult to stay conscious in the process of change. Yousee a person, hear a song, visit a place, remember an experience, and your bodybegins to immediately “turn on” from a past memory. And your associated thoughtabout how to identify with someone or something activates a cascade of reactionsbelow the conscious mind that then returns you back to the same personalityself. You think, act, and feel in predictable, automatic, memorized ways. Yousubconsciously reidentify with your past known environment, which then returnsyou to your known self living in the past.When Pavlov continued to ring the bell without the reward of food being present,in time the dogs’ automatic response lessened because they no longer maintainedthe same association. We could say that the dogs’ repeated exposure to the bellwithout the food dwindled their neuroemotional response. They stopped salivatingbecause the bell became a sound without any associative memory.Catch Yourself Before “Going Unconscious”As you run through a series of situations in your mind’s eye in which you stopyourself from being the old self (emotionally), your repeated exposure to thesame stimuli (mentally) will, over time, weaken your emotional response to thatcondition. And as you consistently present yourself to the same motives of theold identity and notice how you automatically responded, you will becomeconscious enough in your life that you catch yourself from going unconscious. Intime, all of those associations that turned on the old program will become justlike the dogs’ experience of the bell without the food—you no longer knee-jerkback physiologically to the neurochemical you, connected to familiar people orthings.Thus, your thought about a person who makes you angry or your interaction withthe ex-boyfriend can no longer tug on you because you’ve mindfully stoppedyourself enough times. As you break the addiction to the emotion, there can beno autonomic response. It is your conscious awareness in this step that thenfrees you from the associated emotion or thought process in your daily life.Most of the time, these reflexive reactions go by unchecked by you because youare too busy “being” the old you.It is important that you rationalize beyond the barometer of your feelings tounderstand that these survival emotions are affecting your cells in adverse waysby pushing the same genetic buttons and breaking down your body. It raises thequestion: “Is this feeling, behavior, or attitude loving to myself?”After I say “Change,” I like to say, “This is not loving to me! The rewards ofbeing healthy, happy, and free are so much more important than being stuck inthe same self-destructive pattern. I don’t want to emotionally signal the samegenes in the same way and affect my body so adversely. Nothing is worth it.”image [images/p224line.jpg]image [images/p224phone.jpg]WEEK THREEGUIDE TO MEDITATIONDuring your Week Three meditations, your aim is to now add Step 5: Observing andReminding, then Step 6: Redirecting, to the previous steps, so that you aredoing all six. Steps 5 and 6 will ultimately merge to become one step.Throughout your day, as limiting thoughts and feelings come up, observe yourselfand automatically say “Change!” out loud; or hear this—instead of the oldvoice(s)—as the loudest voice in your head. When that happens, you will be readyfor the creation process. * Step 1: As usual, begin by doing the induction. * Steps 2–5: After you recognize, admit, declare, and surrender, it’s time to continue to address the specific thoughts and actions that naturally slip past your awareness. Observe the old you until you become completely familiar with those programs. * Step 6: Then, as you are observing the old you while you are in your meditation, pick a few scenarios in your life and say “Change!” out loud.image [images/p224line1.jpg]image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]CHAPTER THIRTEEN [toc.html#ch13]image [images/line.jpg]CREATE A NEW MIND FOR YOUR NEW FUTURE(Week Four) [toc.html#ch13]STEP 7: CREATING AND REHEARSING [toc.html#sec07]Week Four will be a bit different from previous weeks. First, as you read andwrite for Step 7, you will receive knowledge about creating and instruction onthe “how-to” process of using mental rehearsal. Then you’ll read the GuidedMental-Rehearsal Meditation to follow, to familiarize you with this new process.Next, it’s time to do what you have learned. Every day this week, you willpractice the Week Four meditation, which includes Steps 1 through 7. As youlisten, you will apply the focused attention and repetition you have employed tocreate the new you and your new destiny.Overview: Creating and Rehearsing the New YouBefore you begin the final series of steps, I want to point out that thepreceding steps were all designed to help you break the habit of being yourselfso that you could make room both consciously and energetically for reinventing anew self. Up until this point, you’ve worked at pruning away old synapticconnections. Now it’s time to sprout new ones, so that the new mind you createwill become the platform of who you will be in your future.Your previous efforts have facilitated unlearning some things about your oldself. You’ve weeded out many aspects of the old you. You’ve become familiar withyour unconscious states of mind that represent how you thought, behaved, andfelt. Through the practice of metacognition, you’ve consciously observed theroutine, habitual ways your brain fired within the box of your formerpersonality. The skill of self-reflection has allowed you to separate yourfree-willed consciousness from the automatic programs that caused your brain tofire in the exact same sequences, patterns, and combinations. You’ve examinedhow your brain has probably been working for years now. And since the workingdefinition of mind is the brain in action, you’ve objectively looked at yourlimited mind.Creating the New YouNow that you are beginning to “lose” your mind, it’s time to create a new one.Let’s begin to “plant” a new you. Your daily meditations, contemplations, andrehearsals will be like tending to a garden to yield a greater expression ofyou. Learning new information and reading about great people in history whorepresent your new ideal is like sowing the seeds. The more creative you are inreinventing a new identity, the more diverse the fruits you will experience inyour future. Your firm intention and conscious attention will be like water andsunlight for your dreams in your garden.As you emotionally rejoice in your new future before it is made manifest, youcast a safety net and fence protecting your vulnerable potential destiny frompests and difficult climatic conditions, because your elevated energy shieldsyour creation. And by falling in love with the vision of who you are becoming,you are nurturing the potential plants and fruit with a miracle fertilizer. Loveis a higher-frequency emotion than those survival emotions that allowed theweeds and pests to come in the first place. To eliminate the old and make wayfor the new is the process of transformation.Rehearsing the New YouNext, it’s time to practice creating a new mind over and over again until itbegins to become familiar to you. As you know, the more you fire circuitstogether, the more you wire them into lasting relationships. And if you fire aseries of thoughts related to a particular stream of consciousness, it will beeasier to produce that same level of mind the time after that. Therefore, as yourepeat the same frame of mind every day by mentally rehearsing a new ideal ofself, over time it will become more routine, more familiar, more natural, moreautomatic, and more subconscious. You will begin to remember you as someoneelse.In the previous steps, you also unmemorized an emotion that was stored in yourbody-mind. Now it’s time to recondition your body to a new mind and signal yourgenes in new ways.Your goal in this final step is to master a new mind in the brain as well as thebody. Thus, it becomes so familiar to you that you are able to reproduce thatsame level of being at will and make it look natural and easy. It’s importantthat you memorize this new state of mind by thinking in new ways; equallyrelevant is to then memorize a new feeling in the body so that nothing in yourouter world can move you from it. This is when you are ready to create a newfuture and then live in it. When you rehearse, you bring the new you out ofnothing repeatedly and consistently, so that you “know how” to call it up atwill.Creating: Use Imagination and Inventionto Bring Your New Self into ExistenceIn this step, you’ll start by asking yourself some open-ended questions. As youpose questions that cause you to speculate, to think in different ways than youtypically think, and to entertain new possibilities, this turns on your frontallobe.This entire contemplation process is the building method for making a new mind.You are creating the platform of the new self by forcing the brain to fire innovel ways. You’re beginning to change your mind!image [images/p224line.jpg]Opportunity to WritePlease take time to write down your answers to the following questions. Thenreview them, reflect on them, analyze them, and think about all thepossibilities your answers raise.Questions to turn on your frontal lobe: * What is the greatest ideal of myself? * What would it be like to be ________? * Who in history do I admire, and how did they act? * Who in my life do I know who is/feels ________? * What would it take to think like ________? * Whom do I want to model? * How would I be if I were ________? * What would I say to myself if I were this person? * How would I talk to others if I were changed? * How or whom do I want to remind myself to be?image [images/p224line1.jpg]Your personality consists of how you think, act, and feel. So I’ve grouped somequestions to help you determine more specifically how you want your new self toconduct itself. Remember, when you come up with your own answers, thencontemplate them, you are installing new hardware in your brain and signalingyour genes to activate in new ways in your body. (Feel free to continue to listyour answers in your journal if you don’t think you can mentally keep track ofthem.)How Do I Want to Think? * How would this new person (my ideal) think? * What thoughts do I want to put my energy behind? * What is my new attitude? * What do I want to believe about me? * How do I want to be perceived? * What would I say to myself if I was this person?How Do I Want to Act? * How would this person act? * What would he or she do? * How do I see myself behaving? * How would I speak as this new expression of self?How Do I Want to Feel? * How would this new self be? * What would I feel? * What would my energy be like as this new ideal?image [images/circle.jpg]When you meditate to create the new you, your job is to reproduce the same levelof mind every day, to think and feel differently than you usually do. You shouldbe able to repeat that same frame of mind at will and make it commonplace.Furthermore, you have to allow your body to feel that new feeling until youactually are that new person. In other words, you cannot get up as the sameperson who sat down. Transformation must occur in the here and now, and yourenergy should be different from when you started. If you get up as the sameperson, feeling just as you did when you started, nothing has really happened.You are still the same identity.Therefore, if you say to yourself, “I didn’t feel like it today; I’m too tired;I have too much to do; I am busy; I have a headache; I’m too much like mymother; I can’t change; I want to get something to eat; I can start tomorrow;this doesn’t feel good; I should turn on the TV and watch the news,” and so on;and if you allow those subvocalizations to take the stage of the frontal lobe,you will invariably get up as the same personality.You must use your will, intention, and sincerity to go beyond these urges of thebody. You must recognize this banter and chatter as a fight by the old self forcontrol. You must allow it to rebel, but then bring it back to the presentmoment, relax it, and then start over again. And over time, it will begin totrust you to be the master again.Rehearsing: Memorize the New YouNow that you’ve contemplated your answers, it’s time to rehearse them. Reviewhow you will think, act, and feel as your new ideal. Let’s be clear here. Idon’t want you to become too mechanistic or rigid. This is a creative process.Allow yourself to be imaginative, free, and spontaneous. Don’t force youranswers to be one way or another. Don’t try to go through your list in the sameexact way during each meditative session. There are many different means toarrive at your end.Just think about the greatest expression of yourself and then remind yourselfhow you will act. What will you say, how will you walk, how will you breathe,and how will you feel if you become that person? What will you say to others andto yourself? Your goal is to move into a “state of being” and become this ideal.For instance, think back to those piano players who mentally rehearsed pianoexercises without touching any keys, and how they achieved almost the same brainchanges as people who physically played the same scales and chords for the samelength of time. The “mental” players’ daily rehearsal changed their brains tolook like they had already had the experience of physically executing theactivity. Their thoughts became their experience.If you recall the finger-exercise experiment involving mental rehearsal, therewere also significant physical changes demonstrated in the body, without thesubjects’ ever lifting a finger. In this step, your daily rehearsals will changeyour brain and your body to be ahead of time.That’s why it’s so important to rehearse—to bring up again—how you will act asyour new self. This is how you biologically change the brain and body to nolonger live in the past but rather to chart a map to the future. If the body andbrain are changed, then there is physical evidence that you are changed.Becoming Very Familiar with the New YouThis part of Step 7 is about making the leap to get to the “unconsciouslyskilled” level of expertise. When you are unconsciously skilled at something,that means you just do it without having to place a great deal of consciousthought or attention on the activity. It’s like going from a novice driver to anexperienced one. It’s like being able to knit without having to consciously willeach of the actions into motion. It’s like the old Nike ad slogan: you are justdoing it.If you are getting bored around this point in the exercise, take that as a goodsign. It means that your new mode of operation is beginning to become familiar,common, and automatic. You have to get to this juncture in order to hardwire andembody this information into long-term memory. You must make an effort to gobeyond your boredom, because each time you engage in your new ideal, you manageto be more of the new you with less effort. You engrave your new model of youinto a memory system that then becomes more subconscious and natural. If youkeep practicing it, you won’t have to think about being it. You will have becomeit. Bottom line, practice makes perfect. You are training yourself in thisprocess, like any sport.If you’re doing rehearsal correctly, then each time you practice, it should beeasier for you to accomplish. Why? Because you’re primed; you already have thosecircuits firing in tandem in your brain, and it’s already warmed up. You alsomanufactured the right chemistry, and it’s circulating in your body, selecting anew genetic expression; your body is naturally in the right state. In addition,you have restrained and “quieted down” other brain regions connected to the oldyou. Consequently, the feelings that were associated with the old you are lesslikely to stimulate your body in the same inherent ways.Bear in mind that most of the mental-rehearsal exercises that activate and grownew circuits in the brain involve learning knowledge, getting instruction,paying attention, and repeating the skill over and over. As you know, learningis making new connections; instruction is teaching the body “how to” in order tocreate a new experience; paying attention to what you are doing is absolutelynecessary to rewire your brain, because it involves your being present to thestimuli … both physical and mental; and last, repetition fires and wireslong-term relationships between nerve cells. These are all the ingredients thatit takes to grow new circuits and make a new mind—and this is exactly whatyou’re doing in your meditations. Repetition is what I want to emphasize here.image [images/circle.jpg]Cathy’s story illustrates every facet of mental rehearsal. A massive stroke haddamaged the language center in her brain’s left hemisphere, leaving her unableto talk for months. Doctors told Cathy, a corporate trainer, that she wouldprobably never speak again. Having read my book and completed one of myworkshops, Cathy refused to accept this devastating prognosis.Instead, based on knowledge she had learned and instruction she received, andapplying focused attention and repetition, Cathy mentally rehearsed speaking infront of groups of people. Every day, she practiced this in her mind. Over aperiod of several months, she demonstrated physical changes in her brain andbody, to the extent that she repaired the language center in her brain … andcompletely regained her ability to speak. Today Cathy once again addressesaudiences fluently and flawlessly, with no hesitation.In your own study of this material, you made some important synaptic connectionsas the precursor for you to have new experiences. Both of theseelements—studying information and having experiences—evolve your brain. You arealso being given the proper instruction in the unlearning and relearning processof change. You understand the importance of focus in attending to both mentaland physical activity to mold your brain and change your body to reflect yourefforts. And finally, it is your repeated efforts to rehearse your new idealthat will produce the same level of mind and body, over and over again.Repetition will seal long-lasting circuits and activate new genes for you torevisit the next day with greater ease. This step is for you to practicereproducing the same state of being so it gets simpler.The keys for you to focus on are frequency, intensity, and duration. That is,the more you do it, the easier it gets. The better your focus and concentrationare, the easier it is for you to tap into that particular mind the next time.The longer you can linger in the thoughts and emotions of your new ideal,without letting your mind wander to extraneous stimuli, the more you willmemorize this new state of being. This step is all about getting into becomingyour new ideal in your waking day.Becoming a New Personality Produces a New RealityYour goal in this step is to become a new personality, a new state of being. Soif you are a new personality, you are being somebody else, right? Your oldpersonality, based on how you thought, felt, and acted, has created the realitythat you presently are experiencing. In short, how you are as a personality ishow you are in your personal reality. Remember, also, that your personal realityis made up of how you think, feel, and act. By doing each of those in a new way,you are creating both a new self and a new reality.Your new personality should produce a new reality. In other words, when you arebeing someone else, you naturally will have a different life. If you suddenlychanged your identity, you would be another person, and therefore, you wouldcertainly live as someone else. If the personality called John became thepersonality known as Steve, we could say that John’s life will change because heis no longer being John but is now thinking, acting, and feeling like Steve.Here is another example. One time while I was lecturing in California, a womanapproached me in front of the audience with her hands on her hips, intenselyfocused, angrily exclaiming, “How come I’m not living in Santa Fe?!”I calmly replied, “Because the person who was just talking to me is thepersonality who is living in Los Angeles. The personality who would be living,and is already, in Santa Fe looks nothing like that.”Thus, from a quantum perspective, this new personality is the perfect place tocreate from. The new identity is no longer emotionally anchored to knownsituations in your life that keep recycling the same circumstances; therefore,it is a perfect place from which to envision a new destiny. This is the placeyou want to be to call out a new life. The reason why your prayers were hardlyever answered in the past is that you were trying to hold a mindful intentionwhile being lost in lower emotions such as guilt, shame, sadness, unworthiness,anger, or fear connected to the old self. It was those feelings that weregoverning your thoughts and attitude.The 5 percent of your mind that is conscious was fighting against the 95 percentthat is the subconscious body-mind. Thinking one way and feeling another cannotproduce anything tangible. Energetically, that broadcasts a mixed signal to theinvisible web that orchestrates reality. Thus, if you were “being” guiltybecause your body memorized the mind of guilt, then you probably receivedwhatever you were being—situations in your life that evoked more reasons to feelguilty. Your conscious aim could not stand up against your being that memorizedemotion.As this new identity, however, you are thinking and feeling differently than theold identity. You are in a state of mind and body that now is sending a perfectsignal free from your past memories. For the first time, the lens of your mindis now lifted above the present landscape to see a new horizon. You are lookingto the future, not your past.Simply said, you can’t create a new personal reality while you are still beingthe old personality. You have to become someone else. Once you are in a newstate of being, now is the time to create a new destiny.Creating a New DestinyThis part of the step is where you, as this new state of being, this newpersonality, create a new personal reality. The energy that you released fromthe body earlier is now the raw ingredient to create a new future with.So what do you want? Do you want healing in some area of your body or your life?Do you want a loving relationship, a more satisfying career, a new car, apaid-up mortgage? Do you want the solution to overcoming an obstacle in yourlife? Is your dream to write a book, to send your kids to college or go back toschool yourself, to climb a mountain, to learn to fly, to be free from anaddiction? In all of these examples, your brain automatically creates an imageof what you want.From an elevated state of mind and body; in love, joy, self-empowerment, andgratitude; in a greater, more coherent energy, here is where you see thoseimages in your mind of what you want to create in your new life as this newpersonality. Craft the specific future events you want to experience, byobserving them into physical reality. Let yourself go and begin tofree-associate without analysis. The pictures you see in your mind are thevibrational blueprints of your new destiny. You, as the quantum observer, arecommanding matter to conform to your intentions.With clarity, you will hold the image of each manifestation in your mind for afew seconds, and then let it go into the quantum to be executed by a greatermind.Just like the observer in quantum physics, who looks for an electron and itcollapses from a wave of probabilities into an event called a particle—thephysical manifestation of matter—you are doing the same on a much larger scale.But you are using your “free energy” to collapse waves of probability into anevent called a new experience in your life. Your energy is now entangled withthat future reality, and it belongs to you. Thus, you are entangled with it, andit is your destiny.Finally, give up trying to figure out how or when or where or with whom. Leavethose details to a mind that knows so much more than you do. And know that yourcreation will come in a way that you will least expect, that will surprise youand leave no doubt that it came from a higher order. Trust that the events inyour life will be tailored to your conscious intentions.Now you are developing a two-way communication with this invisibleconsciousness. It shows you that it noticed you emulating it as a creator; itspeaks to you directly; it demonstrates that it is responding to you. How doesit do all this? It creates and organizes unusual events in your life; thesesignify direct messages from the quantum mind. Now you have a relationship witha supreme, loving consciousness.Overview: Guided Mental-Rehearsal MeditationIt’s time to reinvent a new you, by moving into a new state of being thatreflects your new expression of self. After you do so—by priming a new mind andbody—then you rehearse that state of being again. Your efforts to re-create thesame familiar state will biologically change your brain and body ahead of thenew experience. Then once you are a new being in your meditation, a new being isa new personality, and a new personality creates a new personal reality. Here iswhere you, from an elevated energy, create the specific events in your life asthe quantum observer of destiny. Although this Guided Mental-RehearsalMeditation has three parts, when it is incorporated into your Week Fourmeditation (as the Guided Meditation in Appendix C), the parts blend seamlesslytogether.Guided Mental-Rehearsal Meditation: Creating the New YouNow close your eyes, eliminate the environment, and let yourself go by“creating” how you want to live your life.Your job is to move into a new state of being. It’s time to change your mind andthink in new ways. When you do, you will emotionally recondition your body to anew mind by signaling new genes in new ways. Let the thought become theexperience, and live that future reality now. Open your heart and give thanksahead of the actual experience so much so that you convince your body to believethat future event is unfolding now.Pick a potential in the quantum field, and live it completely. It is time tochange your energy from living in the emotions of the past to living in theemotions of a new future. You cannot get up as the same person you were when yousat down.Remind yourself who you will be when you open your eyes. Plan your actions withregard to how you will be in your new reality. Imagine the new you and how youwill speak and what you will say to yourself. Think about what it will feel liketo be this ideal. Conceive of yourself as a new person—doing certain things;thinking certain ways; and feeling the emotions of joy, inspiration, love,empowerment, gratitude, and power.Become so attentive to your intention that your thoughts of a new ideal becomethe experience internally, and as you feel the emotion from that experience, yougo from thinking to being. Remember who and what you really are in your newfuture.Rehearsing the New YouNow, relax for a few seconds. Then “re-view,” re-create, and rehearse what youjust did; do it over again. Let go and see if you can do it repeatedly andconsistently.Can you initiate being that new ideal with greater ease than the last time? Canyou bring it out of nothing one more time? You should naturally be able torecall who you are becoming so that you know how to call it up at will. Yourrepeated efforts will mean doing it so many times that you’ll just “know how”to. When you move into this new state of being, “memorize the feeling.” This isa great place to be.Creating Your New DestinyNow, it’s time to command matter. From this elevated state of mind and body,what do you want in your future life?As you unfold the new self, remember to move into that state of mind and bodythat feels invincible, powerful, absolute, inspired, and overjoyed. Let thepictures come; see them with certainty, with a knowingness that unifies you tothose events or things. Bond with your future as if it is yours, without anyconcern other than expectancy and celebration. Let yourself go and begin tofree-associate without concern. Become empowered by your new sense of self. Withclarity, hold the image of each manifestation in your mind for a few seconds,and then let it go into the quantum to be executed by a greater mind … then goto the next one … keep going … this is your new destiny. Allow yourself toexperience that future reality in the present moment until you convince yourbody to emotionally believe that the event is coming to pass now. Open yourheart and experience the joy of your new life before it actually manifests….Know that where you place your attention is where you place your energy. Theenergy that you released from the body earlier has become the raw materials foryou to use to create a new future. In a state of divinity, true greatness, andgratitude, create by blessing your life with your own energy, and be the quantumobserver of your future. Become entangled to your new reality. As you see theimages of what you want to experience in the energy of this new personality,know that those pictures will become the blueprints of your destiny. You arecommanding matter to conform to your intentions…. When you finish, simply let goand know that your future will unfold in a way that is perfect for you.image [images/p224line.jpg]image [images/p224phone.jpg]WEEK FOURGUIDE TO MEDITATIONNow that you have read the text and journaled for Step 7, you are ready topractice your Week Four meditations. Every day, listen to (or do from memory)the full Week Four meditation.A helpful hint: During the Guided Meditation, you may find yourself feeling sogood that you naturally make statements like these to yourself or out loud: I amwealthy, I am healthy, I am a genius—because you feel like that in a very realway. That’s great. It means mind and body are aligned. It’s important for younot to analyze what you are dreaming. If you do, you will leave the fertileground of the Alpha-wave patterns and return back to Beta-wave patterns, andseparate yourself from your subconscious mind. Just create a new you without anyjudgment.image [images/p224line1.jpg]Guide to Continuing Your MeditationYou’ve just devoted the past several weeks to learning a meditation practicethat can become a lifelong means to help you evolve and create the life youchoose. You also used that new skill to start pruning away a particular aspectof the old you, and to begin creating a new self and a new destiny.At this point, many people ask questions such as these: * How can I continue to get better at the steps and skills of meditating? * Once I have mastered this process, should I keep doing it the same way indefinitely? * How long should I keep working on the same aspect of self that I’ve focused on up to now? * How will I know when I’m ready to peel away another “layer of the onion”? * As I keep using this process, how can I decide which part of my old self to change next? * Can I use this process to work on more than one aspect of my personality at a time?Make This Meditative Process Your OwnIf you continue to do all the steps every day, what used to feel like sevensteps will begin to feel simpler, with more of a flow from step to step. Likeanything you have mastered in your life, you will only get better if youcontinue to meditate daily.As for the Guided Meditation and induction techniques, you might think of themlike training wheels on a bicycle. If using them helped you while you werelearning this process, continue to listen to them for as long as they assist youto move ahead. But once you’re so familiar with the process that you’ve made ityour own, and you feel that listening to guided instructions is holding youback, then let them go.Keep Peeling Away Those LayersMaking periodic adjustments to your meditations is natural and to be expected,because you aren’t the same person you were when you began. If you keep up thedaily sessions, your state of being will continue to evolve, and thus you willcontinue to recognize aspects of your old self that you want to change.Only you can determine when and how quickly you are ready to move ahead. And asI’ll talk about in the next chapter, your progress will depend not just on yourmeditations, but on making change an integral part of your daily life. But ingeneral, working on one particular aspect of yourself in your sessions for fourto six weeks will likely bring enough results that you feel an inner promptingto begin removing another layer of self.So approximately every month, do some self-reflection. Look to your life forfeedback on what you’re creating, and how you’re doing. You might revisit thequestions in Part III and notice any that you would now answer differently.Reevaluate how you’re feeling, who you’ve been “being” in your life, and whetheryou still have the attitude you were working on. If that attitude feels like ithas diminished, have you noticed other unwanted emotions, states of mind, orhabits that feel more prominent now?If so, one approach might be to focus on that aspect of your personality andredo the entire process you just completed. Alternatively, you may want to keepworking on one area while adding another.Once you’ve mastered the basic template for how to meditate, you can combine theemotions you’re working on in a more unified way, addressing several aspects ofyourself at the same time. After a lot of practice, I now work on my whole selfat once, taking what I think of as a holistic, nonlinear approach.Of course, elements of the new destiny you want to create will surely change aswell. When that new relationship or career change comes into your life, youwon’t want to stop there. And every so often, you may also opt to vary yourmeditation just to shake things up a bit. Trust your instincts.Advance Your Understanding Even MoreIf you haven’t already done so, I invite you to visit my website:www.drjoedispenza.com [http://www.drjoedispenza.com].

It’s keeping your energy up, staying conscious in anew reality, independent of your body, independent of the environment, andindependent of time. How are you going to be when you walk into your life?Remind yourself with your family, at your job, with your children, at lunchtomorrow. Can you maintain this modified state of being? If you can live yourlife in the same energy that you created with, then something different shouldshow up in your world—that’s the law. When your behaviors match your intentions,when your actions are equal to your thoughts, when you’re being someone else,then you are ahead of your time. Your environment is no longer controlling howyou think and feel; how you think and feel is controlling your environment.That’s greatness, and it’s always been within you….When how you appear is who you are, you are free from the enslavement of yourpast. And when all of that energy now is liberated, the side effect of thatfreedom is called joy.Demonstrating: Living as the New YouWhen your internal neurochemical state is so orderly and coherent that nostimulus in your incoherent, external world can disrupt who you are “being,”then your mind and body are now working in harmony. You are now a new being. Andby memorizing that state of being—a new personality—your world and your personalreality will begin to reflect your internal changes. When your outwardexpression of self is equal to your inner self, you are headed to a new destiny.Can you maintain the change in your life so that your body does not return tothe same mind? Since emotions are stored in the subconscious memory system, itis your job to consciously keep your body aligned to your new mind so thatnothing in your environment emotionally hooks you back to the old reality. Youmust memorize your new self and insist on being it, so that nothing in yourpresent reality can move you from it.Remember that when you get up from your meditation, if you did it properly, youwill advance from thinking to being. Once you are in that state of being, youare more prone to do and think equal to who you are being.To Demonstrate Is to “Be It” All Day LongIn a nutshell, demonstration is living as if your prayers have already beenanswered. It is rejoicing in your new life with a new level of expectation andexcitement. It is reminding yourself that you must be in that same state of mindand body that you were in when you created your new ideal. You cannot create anew personality in your meditation and then live as the old self for the rest ofthe day. It would be like eating a really healthy meal in the morning and thenspending the rest of the day snacking on junk food.In order for a new experience in reality to happen to you, you have to matchyour behavior with your goal; you align your thoughts and your deeds. You mustmake choices that are consistent with your new state of being. When youdemonstrate, you physically apply what you have mentally rehearsed, getting thebody involved and making it do what the mind has learned.Therefore, in order for you to see the signals unfolding in your life, you mustlive and be in the same energy that you created from. Simply put, if you wantthe universe to begin to talk back to you in new and unusual ways, the energyand the mind that you demonstrate in your life must be the same as the energyand mind of your meditation as that new ideal. This is when you are connectedwith or entangled to the energy you created in a dimension beyond space andtime, and this is how you attract the new event into your life.When both aspects of the self are aligned, the “you” living in the “now life” isthe same being you constructed during your meditation. You are being the futureyou that existed as a potential in the quantum field. And when the new self thatyou created in your meditation is the exact same electromagnetic signature asthe future you that you are being in your life, you are unified to that newdestiny. When you are physically “being one with the future you in the nowmoment” that you dreamed about, you will experience the bounty of a new reality.There will be a response from a greater order.Look Forward to FeedbackThe feedback you experience in your life is the result of matching the state ofbeing/energy of your creative process to the state of being/energy of yourdemonstrative process. It is “being” that being you invented in this particularplane of demonstration. You have to live in that line of time in presentphysical reality. Thus, if you maintain that modified state of mind and body theentire day, something different should show up in your life.And what type of feedback should you begin to witness? Look forward tosynchronicities, opportunities, coincidences, flow, effortless change, betterhealth, insights, revelations, mystical experiences, and new relationships, toname a few. New feedback then will inspire you to keep doing what you have beendoing.When external feedback occurs as a result of your internal efforts, you willnaturally correlate whatever you were doing inside of you with whatever happenedoutside of you. This is a novel moment in and of itself. It basically showsevidence that you are now living by the quantum law. You become astonished thatthe feedback that you are experiencing is the direct result of the internalworkings of your mind and emotions.When you correlate what you did in the implicit world with the explicitmanifestation, you will pay attention and remember whatever you did earlier toproduce that effect, and you will do it again. And when you can connect yourinner world with the effects in the outer world, you are now “causing an effect”instead of living by cause and effect. You are creating reality.Here is the test: Can you be the same person in your external environment thatyou were being in your internal one, while you were meditating? Can you begreater than your present environment, which is connected to your pastpersonality, memories, and associations? Are you able to cease your routinereactions to the same situations? Have you conditioned your body and molded yourmind to be ahead of the present reality in front of you?This is the reason why we meditate. To become someone else in our lives.Demonstrate the New-You Plan into the Equation of Your LifeRemind yourself that during the day, you will keep your energy up as the newyou. Here you are to prompt yourself to stay conscious at different times inyour waking hours. You can prime yourself to place little notes in consciousnesson the canvas of your life.For example:I want to give thanks for different aspects of my life while I take my morningshower. I have to stay on track while I drive to work, so I’m going to be joyousduring the whole trip. How will I be as this new ideal when I see my boss? Letme remind myself to take a moment at lunch and remember who I want to be. When Isee my kids this evening, I will be elevated and have abundant energy, and we’lltruly connect. I want to take a minute while I get ready for bed and remindmyself who I am being.End-of-the-Day QuestionsThese questions are a simple way to review your display of the new self when theday is over: * How did I do today? * When did I fall from grace, and why? * Who was it I reacted to, and where? * When did I “go unconscious”? * How can I do better the next time that happens?Before you go to bed, it might be a nice idea to contemplate where it was duringyour day that you lost your new ideal. Once you can see the obvious place inyour life that stimulated you to fall into oblivion, ask yourself these simplequestions: “If this situation happened again, how would I do it differently?”and “What piece of knowledge or philosophical understanding could I apply tothis circumstance if it arose again?”Once you can come up with a solid answer and attend to it with a bit ofthoughtfulness, you will be mentally rehearsing a new element that rounds outanother part of you. You will be putting the new neural network into your brainto prepare you for the event at some future time. This little move will assistyou in upgrading and refining the model of the new-and-improved you. You thencan add that into your morning or evening meditation.Being Transparent: Going from the Inner to the OuterWhen you are transparent, how you appear is who you are, and your internalthoughts and feelings are reflected in your external environment. Havingachieved this state, your life and your mind are synonymous. It is your finalrelationship between you and all of your outward creations. This means that yourlife reflects your mind in all arenas. You are your life, and your life is areflection of you. If, as quantum physics suggests, the environment is anextension of the mind, this is when your life reorganizes itself to reflect yournew mind.Transparency is a state of true empowerment, in which you have realized (madereal) your dream of personal transformation. You have gained wisdom fromexperience, and are greater than the environment and your past reality.The telltale sign of becoming transparent is that you do not have many overlyanalytical or critical thoughts. You wouldn’t want to think that way. It wouldtake you away from your present state. Since the side effect of transparency istrue joy, more energy, and freedom of expression, any thought that is connectedto an ego drive would lower the elevated feeling within you.There Will Come a Moment …When your life begins to unfold with new and wonderful events, there will come amoment that you will be in awe, wonder, and utter wakefulness when you realizeit was your mind that created them. In your rapture, you will look back fromthis vantage point at your entire life, and you will not want to changeanything. You will not regret any action or feel bad about whatever has happenedto you, because in that moment of your manifestation, it will all make sense toyou. You will see how your past got you to this great state.As the result of your efforts, the consciousness of the greater mind has begunto be your conscious mind; its nature is becoming your nature. You naturallybecome more divine. This is who you really are. This is your natural state ofbeing.Equally, as the invisible giver of life begins to move through you, you willfeel more like yourself than you have in a long time. Those traumas thatproduced emotional scars knocked your true personality from its center. Youbecame more complicated, more polarized, more divided, more inconsistent, andmore predictable. When you unmemorize those survival emotions that naturallylower the frequency of the mind and the body, you are lifted to a higherelectromagnetic expression, and a greater frequency is now turning you on. Andyou free yourself by unlocking the doors to make room for a greater power tobecome you.Finally, it is you and you are it. You are one. And you feel a coherent energycalled love. It is the within that then manifests an unconditional state.image [images/circle.jpg]Once you connect to and drink from the well of consciousness, you mightexperience a real paradox. It is quite possible that there will come such asense of personal wholeness that you will find it difficult to want anything.This dichotomy was a veritable realization for me.Wants and desires come from lacking something, someone, someplace, or some time.In being truly connected to this consciousness, I have had moments that it washard to think about anything else because I felt so great. I felt so completethat any thought that would take me away from it would not be worth my movingfrom this place.So the irony is that once you arrive at this space to create from, you no longerneed anything, because the lack and emptiness from which you desired thosethings has been eliminated, replaced by a feeling of wholeness. As a result, youjust want to linger in the feeling of balance, love, and coherence.This, I feel, is the beginning of true unconditional love. Feeling a sense oflove and awe for life without needing anything from outside of us is freedom. Itis no longer being attached to external elements. It is a feeling that is socoherent that to judge another or to emotionally react to life and change fromthis state is compromising self. This is when the greater consciousness that weare all connected to begins to move out of us, and we begin to express thisthrough us. We move from human toward divine. We become more like it. We becomemore loving, more mindful, more powerful, more generous, more intentional, morekind, and healthier. That’s its mind.Something else amazing begins to occur as well. When you feel elevated andjoyful, you will feel so wonderful that you will want to share the feeling ofwhat you are experiencing with someone. And how do you share such greatfeelings? You give. You think, I feel so superb and uplifted that I want you tofeel the way I feel. So here is a gift. And you will begin to give so thatothers can feel the gift that you’re expressing from within. You are selfless.Imagine a world like that.If, however, you can fashion a new reality from this internal order ofwholeness, you must know that you will be creating from a state of being inconsciousness that is no longer separate from whatever it is you desire. You arein absolute oneness with your creation. And if you can slip into it naturally,and forget about everything that is tied to the old you, you will feel such asense of exuberance that you will begin to know that the creation you arefocusing upon is yours. It will feel like hitting a tennis ball in the sweetspot or parallel parking without mirrors within inches of the curb. It justfeels right. You somehow know.image [images/circle.jpg]This is how I end my daily meditation, and I offer it to you as a suggestion:Now close your eyes. Become aware that there is an intelligence that is withinyou and all around you. Remember that it is real. Contemplate that thisconsciousness is noticing you and is aware of your intentions. Recall that it isa creator that exists beyond space and time.In your journey past the cravings of the body and the nuances of the ego mind,you have made it to this final step. So if in fact this consciousness is realand it exists, ask for a sign to let you know that you made contact with it. Sayto the creator, “If I emulated you in any way as a creator today, send me asignal in the form of feedback in my world to let me know that you were noticingmy efforts. And bring it in a way that I least expect, that wakes me up fromthis dream, and leaves no doubt that it has come from you, so that I am inspiredto do this again tomorrow.”Let me remind you of what I stated in the chapter on the quantum. If thefeedback comes to you in a way that you could have expected or predicted, thenit is nothing new. Resist the temptation to ascribe novelty and unpredictabilityto what you know deep in your soul to be the familiar. In your new life, youmust be startled and, in a sense, taken unaware—not by what came to you, but byhow it came about.When you experience surprise, you wake up from the dream, and the novelty ofwhatever is happening to you is now so thrilling that it captures all of yourattention. You are lifted out of your normal feelings. To “leave no doubt” meansit has to be so cool and fun that you know that what you are doing is actuallyworking. You want to know that this unusual event is coming from this greatermind and that it can’t be anything else.The Ultimate ExperimentYou now have a relationship with the higher consciousness, because it’s talkingback to you, and only you know that what you are doing within is affecting the“without.” Once you know this, you should be inspired to do it again the nextday. In essence, you can now use the emotion of the new experience as new energywith which to create your next outcome. You become like a scientist or anexplorer, experimenting with your life and measuring the results of yourefforts.Our purpose in life is not to be good, to please God, to be beautiful, to bepopular, or to be successful. Our purpose, rather, is to remove the masks andthe façades that block the flow of this intelligence and to express this greatermind through us. To become empowered by our efforts of creativity and to askgreater questions that will inevitably lead us to a more enriched destiny. Toexpect the miraculous instead of the worst-case scenario and to live as if thispower is in favor of us. To ponder the uncommon, to contemplate our achievementsin utilizing this unseen power, and to open our minds to more expandedpossibilities challenges us to evolve our being, to let more of this mind comethrough us.For instance, by your truly healing yourself of some type of malady, then itshould naturally lead to more evolved questions like: “Can I heal someone elsewith a touch? And if I accomplish that feat, is it possible to heal a loved onefrom a distance?” And once you master that possibility because you changed thephysical matter in that person, you might ask, “Can I create something out ofnothing?”How much further can we go? There is no end to this adventure. We are onlylimited by the questions we ask, the knowledge we embrace, and our ability tokeep an open mind and heart.image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]AFTERWORD [toc.html#aft]image [images/line.jpg]Inhabit Self [toc.html#aft]One of the biggest lies we have come to believe about ourselves and our truenature is that we are nothing more than physical beings defined by a materialreality, devoid of dimension and vital energy, and separate from God—which Itrust you know by now is within us and all around us. To keep the truth aboutour real identity from us is not only enslaving, but it asserts that we arefinite beings living a linear life that lacks real meaning.The dictum that there are no realms and no life beyond our physical world andthat we have no control over our destiny is not a “truth” that you and I shouldever believe in. It is my desire that you have become empowered by a bit ofknowledge in this work to help you see who you really are.You are a multidimensional being who creates your reality. Helping you acceptthis idea as your law and new belief has been my labor in this book. Breakingthe Habit of Being Yourself means that you are going to have to lose your mindand create a new one.But when we fully lay down the old, familiar life or mind and start creating thenew, there is a moment between the two worlds that is bereft of anything weknow, and most rush back from this void to the familiar. That place ofuncertainty—the unknown—is what the maverick, the mystic, and the saint know tobe fertile ground.To live in the realm of the unpredictable is to be all potentials at once. Canyou become comfortable in this empty space? If you can, you are at the nexus ofa great creative power, the “I am.”To biologically, energetically, physically, emotionally, chemically,neurologically, and genetically change ourselves and to stop living by theunconscious affirmation that competition, strife, success, fame, physicalbeauty, sexuality, possessions, and power are the be-all and end-all in life iswhen we break from the chains of the mundane. I fear that this so-called recipefor ultimate success in life has kept us looking outside of ourselves foranswers and true happiness, when the real answers and true joy have always beenwithin.So where and how do we find our true self? Do we create a persona that is shapedby associations with the outer environment, which perpetrates the lie? Or do weidentify with something within us that is as real as everything outside us, andcreate a unique identity, which has awareness and a mind that we can emulate?That’s right—it is that infinite resource of information and intelligence,personal and universal, that is intrinsic to all human beings. It is anenergetic consciousness that is filled with such coherence that when it movesthrough us, we can only call it love. When the door opens, its frequency carriessuch vital information that it changes who we are from within. This is anexperience that I have humbly learned to live for.It is my hope that you know that you always have access to it, if you choose.But if you live life as a materialist, then you will struggle with itsexistence. Why? Well, realists will use their senses to define reality; and ifthey can’t see it, taste it, smell it, touch it, or hear it, then it doesn’texist, right? This duality is a perfect scheme for keeping people lost in theillusion. Just keep their attention on an outer reality that is ultimately sosensually pleasurable or chaotic, and going within will seem too difficult.Your attention is where your energy is. Put all of your attention on theexternal, material world, and that becomes your investment in reality. On thecontrary, command your mindfulness to unfold a deeper aspect of yourself, andyour energy will expand that reality. You, as a human being, have the freedom toplace your awareness on anything. To develop your ability to manage and properlyuse this abundance of power is the gift. Wherever you put your thoughts and yourawareness becomes your reality.If you stop believing that thought is real, you will fall back into materialismand stop doing the work. You’ll simply choose some emotional addiction or habitfor immediate gratification and then talk yourself out of possibility.Herein lies the dilemma: The future reality we create in our minds does not yetprovide any sensory feedback, and by the quantum model, our senses should be thelast to experience what we create. For this reason, many of us make materialismour law once again, and we go unconscious.I want to remind you that all things material come from the invisible field ofthe immaterial, beyond space and time. Simply said, by planting seeds in thisworld, you see that in time they bear fruit. If you can experience a dream socompletely in mind and emotion within the inner world of potentials, then it hasalready happened. So just surrender; it has to sprout into your outer life. Itis the law.But here is the hardest part of this whole process: making or taking the timefor your precious self to actually do it.That’s it. We are divine creators. It is what we do when we are inspired andpressed to know more. But you and I are also creatures of habit. We develophabits for everything. We possess three brains that allow us to evolve fromknowledge to experience to wisdom. To make whatever we learn implicit throughthe repetition of experience, we can teach the body to become the mind—that isour definition of a habit.The problem is that we have developed habits that limit our true greatness. Thesurvival emotions, which are so addictive, cause us to live with limitation,feeling separate from the Source, and forget we are creators. In fact, thecorresponding states of mind that correlate with stress truly are the reasonswhy we are controlled by our emotions, live by a lower denominator of energy,and are enslaved by a set of beliefs rooted in fear. These so-called normalpsychological states have been accepted by most as ordinary and common. They arethe real “altered states” of consciousness.Hence, I want to emphasize that anxiety, depression, frustration, anger, guilt,pain, worry, and sadness—the emotions regularly expressed by billions ofpeople—are why the masses live life knocked out of balance and altered from thetrue self. And maybe the supposed altered states of consciousness achieved inmeditation during true mystical moments are actually “natural” human states ofconsciousness that we should strive to live by on a regular basis. I accept thatcontention as my truth.It’s time to wake up and to be the living example of the truth. It’s not enoughto espouse these understandings; it’s time to live them, demonstrate them, andbe “at cause” in all areas of our lives. When you and I “in-body” such ideals astruth, and make them a habit, then they innately become part of us.Since we are wired to create habits, why not make true greatness, compassion,genius, ingenuity, empowerment, love, awareness, generosity, healing, quantummanifestation, and divinity our new habits? To remove the layers of personalemotions we decided to memorize as our identity; to shed our selfish limitationsthat we have given such power to; to abandon false beliefs and perceptions aboutthe nature of reality and self; to overcome our neural habituations ofdestructive traits that repeatedly undermine our evolution; and to relinquishthe attitudes that have kept us from knowing who we really are … are all part offinding the true self.There is an aspect of the self that is a benevolent being who waits behind allof those veils. This is who we are when we are not feeling threatened; fearingloss; trying to please everyone; racing to succeed and scrambling to get to thetop at any cost; regretting the past; or feeling inferior, hopeless, desperate,or greedy, just to name a few. When we overcome, and remove whatever stands inthe way of our infinite power and self, we are demonstrating a noble deed, notonly for ourselves but for all of humanity.So the greatest habit you will ever break is the habit of being yourself, andthe greatest habit you will ever create is the habit of expressing the divinethrough you. That is when you inhabit your true nature and identity. It is toinhabit self.image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]APPENDIX A [toc.html#appA]image [images/line.jpg]BODY-PART INDUCTION(Week One) [toc.html#appA]image [images/p224phone.jpg]Now, can you become aware of the space that your lips occupy in space, and canyou sense the volume of space that your lips are in … in space….1[endnotes.html#appA_en1]And now can you sense the space that your jaw occupies in space … can you noticethe volume of space that your entire jaw is in … in space….And now can you feel the space that your cheeks occupy in space … and thedensity of space that your cheeks take up … in space….And now notice the space that your nose occupies in space.

I recommend that you sit up in a chair with your feet flat on the floor,hands resting on your knees.Imagine warm water beginning to rise in the room … first, as it covers your feetand ankles, feel the warmth of your feet as they’re immersed in the water….And allow the water to move higher now, up past your calves and shins, to rightbelow your knees; and feel the weight of your legs from your feet to yourcalves, underwater….Let yourself relax as the water reaches your knees and rises over your thighs….As it surrounds your thighs, feel your hands immersed in this warm water … feelthe warmth consume your wrists and forearms….Now become aware of the soothing water as it encircles your buttocks, yourgroin, and your inner thighs….And as the water rises all the way up to your waist, feel it submerge yourforearms and elbows….As the warm water continues to climb to your solar plexus, notice it as it moveshalfway up your arms….Now, sense the weight of your body, immersed up to your rib cage under the warmliquid, and feel it consuming your arms….And now allow the water to encircle your chest and move across your shoulderblades….As the water rises all the way up to your neck, allow it to cover your shoulders… and from your neck down, feel the weight and density of your body, immersedunder this warm liquid….Now, as the water moves up past your neck, feel the column of your neck, up toyour chin, immersed underwater….And allow the soothing water to move up over your lips and around thecircumference of the back of your head … as it rises over your upper lip andover your nose, relax and let it consume you, so that the warmth of the water isnow right below your eyes….Allow the water to rise above your eyes, and feel everything from your eyes downimmersed in this warm liquid. Feel it move up around your forehead, above thecrown of your head; and as the circumference gets smaller and smaller, allow itto move above your head….And now surrender into this warm, relaxing water and allow yourself to feel yourbody in its weightlessness, embraced by this water. Allow your body to feel thedensity of itself, immersed in this liquid….Feel the volume of the water around your body and the space that your body isin, underwater. Let your awareness take in the entire room, submergedunderwater. Sense the space that is filled by the room, consumed by warm water …and for a few moments, just feel your body floating in that space….image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]APPENDIX C [toc.html#appC]image [images/line.jpg]GUIDED MEDITATION: PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER(Weeks Two Through Four) [toc.html#appC]image [images/p224phone.jpg]You may wish to lead off this meditation with the Body-Part Induction inAppendix A, the Water-Rising Induction in Appendix B, or any other method youhave used in the past or devised on your own.Close your eyes and take a few deep, slow breaths to relax your mind and body.Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Make your breaths long,slow, and steady. Rhythmically inhale and exhale until you move into thepresent. When you are in the moment, you are entering a world of possibility….Now, there is a powerful intelligence within you that is giving you life, whichloves you so much. When your will matches its will, when your mind matches itsmind, when your love for life matches its love for you, it always responds. Itwill move in you and all around you, and you will see evidence in your life as aresult of your efforts. To be greater than your environment, to be greater thanthe conditions in your life, to be greater than the feelings that are memorizedin the body, to think greater than the body, to be greater than time … meansthat you are tugging on the garment of the divine. Your destiny, then, is areflection of, a co-creation with, a greater mind. Love yourself enough to dothis….Week TwoRecognizing. Now, you cannot create a new future while holding on to theemotions of the past. What was the emotion that you wanted to unmemorize?Remember what that emotion feels like in your body…. And recognize the familiarstate of mind that is driven by that emotion….Admitting. It’s time to turn to the power within you, introduce yourself to it,and tell it what you want to change about yourself. Begin to admit to it who youhave been, and what you have been hiding. In your mind, talk to it. Rememberthat it is real. It already knows you. It doesn’t judge you. It only loves….Say to it, “Universal consciousness within me and all around me, I have been________, and I truly want to change from this limited state of being….”Declaring. It’s time to free the body from the mind, to close the gap betweenhow you appear and who you are, to liberate your energy. Release your body fromthe familiar emotional bonds, which keep you connected to every thing, everyplace, and everyone in your past and present reality. It is the moment to freeup your energy. I want you to say the emotion you want to change, out loud, andliberate it from your body as well as your environment. Say it now….Surrendering. And now it’s time to surrender this state of being to a greatermind and to ask it to resolve this in a way that is right for you. Can yourelinquish control to a greater authority that already has the answers?Surrender to this infinite mind and understand that this intelligence isabsolutely real. It only waits in admiration and in willingness. It onlyresponds when you ask for help. Surrender your limitation to an all-knowingintelligence. Simply open the door, give it up, and let go completely. Let ittake your limitation from you. “Infinite mind, I give you my ________. Take itfrom me and resolve this emotion into a greater sense of wisdom. Free me fromthe chains of my past.” Now, just feel how you would feel if you knew this mindwas taking this memorized emotion from you….Week ThreeObserving and Reminding. Now let’s make sure that no thought, no behavior, nohabit that causes you to return back to the old self goes unnoticed by you. Tomake sure, let’s become conscious of those unconscious states of mind andbody—how did you used to think when you felt that way? What did you say toyourself? What voice did you believe that you no longer want to accept as yourreality? Observe those thoughts….Begin to separate yourself from the program. How did you once behave? How didyou speak? Become conscious of those unconscious states to such an extent thatthey would never go unnoticed by you again….To begin to objectify the subjective mind, to begin to observe the program,means you are no longer the program. Awareness is your goal. Remind yourself whoyou no longer want to be, how you no longer want to think, how you no longerwant to behave, and how you no longer want to feel. Become familiar with allaspects of the old personality, and just observe. With firm intention, make achoice to no longer be that person, and let the energy of your decision become amemorable experience….Redirecting. Now it’s time to play the “Change Game.” I want you to imaginethree scenarios in your life where you could start to feel like the old selfagain, and when you do, I want you to say “Change!” out loud. First, imaginethat it is morning and you are in the shower, and as you are getting ready foryour day, all of a sudden you notice that familiar feeling just starting to comeup. And the moment you notice it, you say “Change!”—that’s right, you change it.Because living by that emotion is not loving to you. And it is no use signalingthe same genes in the same way. And nerve cells that no longer fire together, nolonger wire together. You control that….Next, I want you to see yourself in the middle of the day. You are driving downthe road, and suddenly, that familiar feeling that drives those familiarthoughts starts to come up, and what do you do? You say, “Change!” That’s right,you change. Because the rewards of being healthy and happy are so much moreimportant than returning back to the old self. And by the way, living by thatemotion has never been loving to you. And every time you change your state, youknow that nerve cells that no longer fire together, no longer wire together, andyou no longer turn on the same genes in the same ways….Now I want you to play the Change Game one more time. I want you to see yourselfgetting ready for bed, and you are pulling the covers back, and as you start toget into bed, you notice that familiar feeling coming up, which is tempting youto behave as the old personality, and what do you do? You say, “Change!” That’sright. Because nerve cells that no longer fire together, no longer wiretogether. Signaling that gene in that way is not loving to you, and nobody andnothing is worth it. You control that….Week FourCreating. Now, what is the greatest expression of yourself that you can be? Howwould a great person think and act? How would such an individual live? How wouldhe or she love? What does greatness feel like? …I want you to move into a state of being. It is time to change your energy andbroadcast a whole new electromagnetic signature. When you change your energy,you change your life. Let the thought become the experience, and let thatexperience produce an elevated emotion so that your body begins to emotionallybelieve that the future you is already living now….Allow yourself to turn on new genes in new ways; signal the body emotionallyahead of the actual event; allow yourself to fall in love with the new ideal;open your heart and begin to recondition your body to a new mind….Let the inward experience become a mood, then a temperament, and finally a newpersonality….Move into a new state of being… How would you feel if you were this person? Youcan’t get up as the same person who sat down. You have to feel so much gratitudethat your body begins to change ahead of the actual event, and accept that thenew ideal already is you….Become it….To be empowered—to be free, to be unlimited, to be creative, to be genius, to bedivine—that is who you are….Once you feel this way, memorize this feeling; remember this feeling. This iswho you really are….Now let go and release it into the field for a moment; just let go….Rehearsing. Now, like those piano players who changed their brains and thefinger exercisers who changed their bodies, let’s do it again. Can you createyour new self out of nothing one more time? …Let’s fire and wire a new mind and recondition the body to a new emotion. Becomefamiliar with a new state of mind and body. What is the greatest expression ofyour self? Allow yourself to begin to think like this ideal again….What would you say to yourself, how would you walk, how would you breathe, howwould you move, how would you live, what would you feel? Allow yourself toemotionally feel like this new self, so much so that you begin to move into anew state of being….It is time to change your energy again and remember what it feels like to bethis person. Expand your heart….Who do you want to be when you open your eyes? You are signaling new genes innew ways. Feel empowered once again. Move into a new state of being; a new stateof being is a new personality; a new personality creates a new personalreality….This is where you create a new destiny. From this elevated state of mind andbody, it is time to command matter as a quantum observer of your new reality.Feel invincible, powerful, inspired, and overjoyed….From this new state of being, form a picture of some event you want toexperience and let the image become the blueprint of your future. Observe thatreality and allow the particles, as waves of probability, to collapse into anevent called an experience in your life. See it, command it, hold it, and thenmove to the next picture….Let your energy now become entangled to that destiny. That future event has tofind you because you created it with your own energy. Let yourself go and createthe future you want in certainty, trust, and knowingness….Do not analyze; do not try to figure out how it is going to happen. It is notyour job to control the outcome. It is your task to create, and leave thedetails to a greater mind. As you see your future as the observer, simply blessyour life with your own energy….From a state of gratitude, be one with your destiny from a new state of mind andbody. Give thanks for a new life….Feel how you will feel when these things manifest in your life, because livingin a state of gratitude is living in a state of receivership. Feel like yourprayers are already answered….Finally, it is time to turn to that power within you and ask it for a sign inyour life: if today you emulated this greater mind as a creator who is observingall of life into form, and you made contact with it, and it has been observingyour efforts and intentions, then it should show cause in your life. Know thatit is real, that it exists, and that you now have a two-way communication withit. Ask that this sign from the quantum field come in a way that you would leastexpect, that surprises you and leaves no doubt that this new experience has comefrom universal mind, so that you are inspired to do it again. I want you now toask for a sign….And now move your awareness back to a new body in a new environment and in awhole new line of time. And when you are ready, bring your awareness back up toBeta. Then you can open your eyes.image [images/circle1.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"image [images/head.jpg]ENDNOTES [toc.html#end]image [images/line.jpg]Introduction1. [introduction.html#itra] Bohr, Niels, “On the constitution of atoms andmolecules.” Philosophical Magazine, 26: 1–24 (1913). If you really want to splitthe hairs of the subatomic world, the volume of an atom (roughly 1 angstrom, or10-10 meters in diameter) is about 15 orders of magnitude larger than the volumeof the nucleus (roughly 1 femtometer, or 10-15 meters in diameter)—meaning theatom is roughly 99.9999999999999 percent empty space. Although the electroncloud around the nucleus accounts for most of the atom’s area, this cloud ismostly empty space, and the electrons within it are minuscule to begin with. Thehighly dense nucleus contains most of the mass of the atom. The relative size ofan electron in reference to the nucleus would be like the volume of a peacompared to an SUV, and the perimeter of the electron cloud relative to the SUVwould be about the size of Washington State.Chapter 11 [chap01.html#ch01_en1]. For example, see Amit Goswami, Ph.D., The Self-AwareUniverse (New York: Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1993). Also, the “Copenhageninterpretation” of quantum theory developed by Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg,Wolfgang Pauli, and others says, among other things, that “reality is identicalwith the totality of observed phenomena (which means reality does not exist inthe absence of observation).” See: Will Keepin, “David Bohm,” available at:http://www.vision.net.au/~apaterson/science/david_bohm.htm[http://www.vision.net.au/~apaterson/science/david_bohm.htm].2 [chap01.html#ch01_en2].

He also holds aBachelor of Science degree with an emphasis in neuroscience, and received hisDoctor of Chiropractic degree from Life University in Atlanta, Georgia,graduating magna cum laude.Dr. Joe’s postgraduate training has been in neurology, neuroscience, brainfunction and chemistry, cellular biology, memory formation, and aging andlongevity. He is an honorary member of the National Board of ChiropracticExaminers, the recipient of a Clinical Proficiency Citation for clinicalexcellence in doctor-patient relationships from Life University, and a member ofPi Tau Delta, the international chiropractic honor society.Over the last 12 years, Dr. Joe has lectured in more than 24 countries on sixcontinents, educating thousands about the role and function of the human brainand how to reprogram their thinking through scientifically provenneurophysiological principles. As a result, many individuals have learned toreach their specific goals and visions by eliminating self-destructive habits.His simple yet powerful teaching approach creates a bridge between true humanpotential and the latest scientific theories of neuroplasticity. Dr. Joeexplains how thinking in new ways, as well as changing beliefs, can literallyrewire one’s brain. His work is founded in his total conviction that withinevery person on this planet is the latent potential of greatness and unlimitedabilities.Dr. Joe’s first book, Evolve Your Brain: The Science of Changing Your Mind,connects the subjects of thought and consciousness with the brain, mind, andbody. It explores “the biology of change.” In other words, when we truly changeour minds, there is physical evidence of change in the brain.As an author of several scientific articles on the close relationship betweenthe brain and the body, Dr. Joe explains the roles played by brain chemistry andneurophysiology in physical health and disease. His latest DVD release of EvolveYour Brain: The Science of Changing Your Mind looks at the ways in which thehuman brain can be harnessed to affect reality through the mastery of thought,and he has created an educational and inspiring CD series in which he answerssome of the questions he is most commonly asked. In his research intospontaneous remissions, Dr. Joe has found similarities among people who haveexperienced so-called miraculous healings, showing that they have actuallychanged their minds, which then changed their health.One of the scientists, researchers, and teachers featured in the award-winningfilm What the BLEEP Do We Know!?, Dr. Joe has made additional guest appearancesin the theatrical director’s cut as well as the extended Quantum Edition DVDset, What the BLEEP!? Down the Rabbit Hole, along with the new docudrama ThePeople vs. The State of Illusion. He also serves as an editorial advisor ofExplore! magazine.When not traveling and writing, Dr. Joe is busy seeing patients at hischiropractic clinic near Olympia, Washington.
