But the stat e of the world at the end of the Great War see med to demand an enquir y into the present phase of the revolut ionar y movement, hence my attempt to follow i ts course up to m odern times in World Revolution . And now before returning to that first cat aclysm I have fel t impelled to devot e one m ore book to the Revolut ion as a whole by going this ti me furth er back into the past and at tempting to trace its origins from the first centur y of the Christi an era. For it is onl y by taking a gener al survey of th e movement that i t is pos sible to understand the causes of an y particu lar phase of its existenc e. The French Revolut ion did not arise merely out of condit ions or ideas pecu liar to the eighteen th cen tury, nor the Bolshevist Revolu tion out of polit ical and socia l condi tions in Russia or the teach ing of Karl Marx. Both these explosions were produced b y forces which, m aking use of popular suffering and discontent, had long been gathering strength for an on slaught not only on Christi anity, but on al l socia l and m oral order . It is of im mense significan ce to notice with what resentment this point of view is m et in certain quarters. When I first began to write on revolu tion a well-known London publisher said to m e, \"Re member th at if you take an anti- revolution ary line you will have the whole li terary world against y ou.\" This appeared to me extraordinar y. Why should the literary world sympathize with a mo vement which from the French Revolution onwards has alwa ys been direc ted aga inst li teratur e, art, and scienc e, and has openl y proclai med its aim to exal t the manual workers over the int elligentsia? \"W riters m ust be proscribed as the most dangerous ene mies of th e people,\" said Robespierre ; his col league Dum as said all clever m en should be guil lotined. \"The system of persecution against men of ta lents was or ganized.... They cried out in the sect ions of Paris, ' Beware of that man for he has written a book!'\" 1 Precise ly the same poli cy has been followed in Russia. Under Moderat e Socia lism in Germ any the professor s, not the \"people,\" are starv ing in garre ts. Yet the whole press of our countr y is perm eated with subversive influen ces. Not m erely in partisan work s, but in m anuals of histor y or literature for use in Schools, Burke is reproa ched for warning us aga inst the French Revolut ion and Carl yle's paneg yric is applauded. And whilst every slip on the part of an anti- revolut ionar y writer is seized on by the critics and held up as an exa mple of th e whole, the most glar ing errors not onl y of conclusions but of facts pass uncha llenged if the y happen to be com mitted by a part isan of the movement. The principl e laid down b y Collot d'Herbois sti ll holds good: \"Tout est permis pour quiconque agit dans le sens de la révolution.\" All this was unkno wn to me when I first e mbarked on m y work. I knew tha t French writers of the past had distorted facts to suit their own poli tical views, tha t a conspiracy of histor y is still direct ed by certain inf luences in the m asonic lodges and the Sorbonne; I did not know that this conspirac y was being carried on in this countr y. Therefor e the publisher's warning did not daunt me. If I was wrong either in m y conc lusions or facts I was prepared to be cha llenged.

But al though m y book"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"received a great many generous and appreci ative reviews in th e press, criti cisms which were hosti le took a form which I had never ant icipated. Not a single honest attempt was made to refu te either m y French Revolution or World Revolu tion by the usual methods of controv ersy; state ments founded on docum entary evidence were met with flat contr adiction unsupported by a shred of counter evidence. In genera l the plan adopt ed was not to disprove, but to discred it by means of flagran t misquot ations, by attribu ting to me views I had never expres sed, or even b y means of offensive personali ties. It will surely be adm itted that this me thod of atta ck is unpara lleled in any other sphere of literary controvers y. It is interest ing to not ice that precisel y the sa me line was adopt ed a hundred years ago with regard to Professor Robison and the Abbé Barruel, whose works on the secre t causes of the French Revolu tion cre ated an immense sensation in their day. The legit imate criticisms that might have been made on their work find no pl ace in the di atribes level led against the m; their ene mies cont ent them selves merely with calu mnies and abuse. A contemporar y Americ an writer , Seth Pa yson, thus describes the methods employed to discred it them: The testimony of Profes sor Robison and Abbé Barruel would doubtless have been consider ed as a mple in an y case which did not inter est the prejudices and passions of me n against the m. The scurril ity and odiu m with which the y have been loaded is perfectl y natur al, and what the nature of the ir test imony would have led one to expec t. Men will endeavour to inva lidate that evid ence which tends to unveil th eir dark designs: and it canno t be expe cted that those who believe that \"the end sanctifi es the m eans\" will be ver y scrupulous as to th eir m easur es. Certain ly he was not who inven ted the following character and arbi trarily appli ed it to Dr . Robison, which m ight have been app lied with as much propriet y to an y other person in Europe or America. The charact er here referred to, is tak en fro m the American Mercury , print ed at Hartford, Septe mber 26, 1799, b y E. Babco ck. In this pape r, on the pretended authorit y of Profes sor Ebe ling, we are told \"that Robison had lived too fast for his inco me, and to supply defici encies had undertak en to alter a bank bill, that he was detec ted and fled to France; tha t having been expe lled the Lodge in Edinbur gh, he appli ed in France for the second grade, but was refused; that he made the same attempt in Ger many and afterwards in Rus sia, but never succeeded; and from this enter tained the bitter est hatred to m asonr y; and after wandering about Europe for two y ears, b y writing to Secre tary Dundas, and present ing a cop y of his book, w hich, it was j udged, would answer cert ain purposes of the ministry, the prosecut ion aga inst hi m was stopped, the Professor returned in triu mph to his countr y, and now liv es upon a handso me pension, instead of su ffering the fate of his prede cessor D odd.\" 2 Payson goes on to quote a writer in The National Intelligenc er of Januar y 1801, who styles hims elf a \"friend to truth\" and speaks of Professor Robison as \"a ma n dist inguished by abject dependenc e on a part y, by the base cri mes of fo rgery and adult ery, and by frequen t parox ysms of insanit y.\" Mounier goes further still, and in his pa mphlet De l'influenc e attribué e aux Ph ilosophes, ... Francs-maçons et ... Illumin és , etc., inspired b y the Illuminatus Bode, quotes a stor y that Robison suf fered fro m a form of insanit y which consisted in his bel ieving that the posterior portion of his bod y was m ade of glass! 3"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"In support of al l this farrago of nonsense there is of course no foundation of truth; Robison was a well- known savant who lived sane and respected to the end of his da ys. On his death Watt wrote of hi m: \"He was a m an of the cl earest head and the most scien ce of an ybody I have ever known.\" 4 John Pla yfair, in a paper read before the Royal Socie ty of Edinbur gh in 1815, whilst cr iticizing his Proofs of a Con spiracy --though at the sa me time admitting he had hi mself never had access to the docum ents Robison had consult ed!--paid the following tribut e to his charact er and erudi tion: His range in science was most extensive ; he was fa miliar with the whole circle of the accurate sciences.... Nothing can add to the esteem which they [i.e. \"those who were personal ly acqua inted with hi m\"] felt for his talen ts and worth or to the respect in which they now hold his me mory. 5 Neverth eless, the lies circu lated against both Robison and Barruel were not without effect. Thirteen y ears later we find another American, th is time a Free mason, confessing \"with shame and grief and indign ation\" that he had been carried away by \"the flood of vitup eration poured upon Barrue l and Robison during the past thirty years,\" that the ti tle pages of th eir works \" were fearful to hi m,\" and that although \"wishing calmly and candidly to investiga te the chara cter of Freemasonr y he refused for mon ths to open their books.\" Yet when in 1827 he read them for the first time he was astonished to find that they showed \"a manifest tendenc y towards Freem asonr y.\" Both Barruel and Robison, he now real ized, were \"learned men, cand id men, lovers of the ir countr y, who had a rever ence for truth and re ligion. They give the reasons for their opinions, the y quote th eir author ities, nam ing the author and page, like hone st people; they both had a wish to rescue British Masonr y from the conde mnation and fellowship of con tinent al Masonr y and appear to be sincerel y actuated by the desire of doing good b y giving their labours to the public.\" 6 That the author was right here in his descrip tion of Barruel's atti tude to Freem asonr y is shown b y Barruel's o wn words on the subject: England above all is full of those upright m en, excel lent citizens, m en of ever y kind and in every condi tion of l ife, who count it an honour to be m asons, and who are distingu ished fro m other m en only by ties which seem to strengthen those of benevolen ce and fraternal chari ty. It is not the fear of of fending a nation amongst which I have found a refuge which pro mpts m e to m ake this exc eption. Gratitud e would prevai l with me over all such terrors and I should say in the m idst of London: \"England is lost, she will not escape the French Revolut ion if the masonic lodges rese mble those I have to unvei l. I would even say more: governm ent and all Christian ity would long ago have been lost in England if one could suppose its Free masons to be ini tiated into the last m ysteries of the sect.\" 7 In anoth er passage Barrue l observes that Masonry in England is \"a societ y composed of good ci tizens in genera l who se chief object is to help each oth er by princip les of equa lity which for them is noth ing else but universal fraterni ty.\" 8 And aga in: \"Let us ad mire it [the wisdom of Engl and] for having known how to m ake a rea l source of benef it to the State"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"out of those sam e mysteries which e lsewhere conce al a profound conspirac y against the State and re ligion.\" 9 The only criticism British Freemasons ma y make on this verdict is that Barruel regards Masonr y as a s ystem which original ly conta ined an ele ment of danger that has been eliminated in England whilst the y regard i t as a s ystem originally innocuous into which a dangerous e lement was inserted on the Contin ent. Thus accord ing to the for mer conception Freemasonr y might be co mpared to one of the brass shell- cases brought back from the bat tle-fields of France and convert ed into a flower -pot holder , whilst ac cording to the la tter it rese mbles an innoc ent brass flower -pot holder which has been used as a receptac le for exp losives. The fac t is tha t, as I shall endeavour to show in the course of this book, F reemasonr y being a composit e system there is som e justific ation for both these theories. In either case it will be seen that Continen tal Masonry alone stands conde mned. The plan of represen ting Robison and Barruel as the ene mies of Brit ish Ma sonry can therefore onl y be regarded as a me thod for discredit ing the m in the e yes of Brit ish Freemasons, and consequentl y for bringing th e latter over to the side of their antagon ists. Exactly the sa me method of atta ck has been direct ed against those of us w ho during the last few y ears have a ttempted to warn the world of the secret forces working to destro y civilization; in my own case even the plan of accusing me of having attacked Bri tish Masonr y has been adopt ed without the shadow of a foundat ion. From the beginning I have alwa ys different iated between British and G rand Orient Masonr y, and have number ed high Bri tish Mason s amongst my friends. But what is the m ain char ge brought aga inst us ? Like Robison and Barruel, we are accused of raising a false al arm, of cre ating a boge y, or of being the victi ms of an obsession. Up to a point this is co mpreh ensible. Whilst on th e Continen t the import ance of secre t societ ies is taken as a m atter of course and the librari es of foreign cap itals tee m with book s on the question, peop le in this countr y reall y imagine that secret societ ies are things of the past--ar ticles to this effect appe ared qui te rec ently in two lead ing London newspapers--whilst prac tically nothing of an y value has been written about the m in our langu age during the last hundred y ears. Hence ideas tha t are commonplaces on the Contin ent here appear sensational and extrav agant. The m ind of the Eng lishm an does not readily accept anything he cannot see or even so metimes anything he can see which is unprec edented in his exper ience, so that like the West American far mer, confronted for the first ti me by the sight of a giraf fe, his i mpulse is to cry out angri ly: \"I don't bel ieve it!\" But whilst making all allowanc e for honest ignoran ce and incredul ity, it is i mpossible not to recognize a cer tain method in the m anner in which the cr y of \"ob session\" or \"boge y\" is raised. For it will be noti ced tha t peopl e who s pecialize on other sub jects are not describ ed as \"obses sed.\" We did not hear, for exa mple, that the la te Professor Einste in had Relat ivity \"on the brain\" because he w rote and le ctured exclusive ly on this quest ion, nor do we hear it suggested that Mr . Howard Carter is obses sed with the ide a of Tutankh amen and that it would be well if he were to set out for the South Pole by way of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"a change. Again, all those who warn the world conc erning even tualities the y conc eive to be a danger are not accused of creat ing boge ys. Thus although Lord Roberts was denounc ed as a scare mong er for ur ging the countr y to prepare for defence against a design openl y avowed b y Germany both in speech and print, and in 1921 the Duke of Northu mber land was decl ared the victim of a delusion for bel ieving in the existenc e of a plot against the Bri tish E mpire which had been procl aimed in a thousand revolut ionar y harangu es and pa mphl ets. People who, withou t bothering to produce a shred of documentary evidenc e, had sounded the alarm on the menace of \"French I mper ialism\" and asserted that our form er Allies were engaged in building a vast fle et of aerop lanes in order to att ack our coasts. They were not held to be e ither scarem ongers or insane. On the contr ary, although som e of th ese sam e peop le were proved by events to have been completely wrong in the ir prognostic ations a t the beginning of the Great War, they are still regard ed as oracl es and som etimes even described as \"think ing for half Europe.\" Another instance of this kind m ay be ci ted in the case of Mr . John Spar go, author of a small book ent itled The Jew and American Ideals . On page 37 of th is work Mr . Spargo in refuting the accusat ions brought against the Jews ob serves: Belief in widespread conspirac ies dire cted against ind ividua ls or the stat e is probabl y the commonest for m assumed by the hum an mind when it loses its balance and its sense of proportion. Yet on page 6 Mr . Spar go decl ares that when visiting this countr y in Septe mber and October 1920: I found in England great nat ion-wide organizations, obviousl y well financed, devoted to the sinister purpose of cre ating anti- Jewish fee ling and senti ment. I found specia l articles in influent ial newspapers devoted to the sa me evil purpo se. I found at at least one j ournal, obviousl y well finan ced aga in, exclusiv ely devoted to the fostering of su spicion, fear , and hatred against the Jew ... and in the bookstores I discovered a whole l ibrary of books devot ed to th e sam e end. It will be seen then tha t a be lief in widespread conspira cies is not alwa ys to be regard ed as a sign of loss of m ental balance, even when these conspiraci es rem ain completely invisib le to the gener al public. For those of us who were in London during the period of Mr. Spar go's visit saw nothing of th e things he here describes. Wher e, we ask, were these \"grea t nation-wide or ganiz ations\" striving to create anti- Jewish senti ments? What were their names? B y whom were the y led? It is true, however , that there were nation-wide organiz ations in existenc e here at this date inst ituted for the purpo se of com bating Bolshevis m. Is anti-Bolshev ism then synonymous with \"anti- Semitism\"? 10 This is the conclusion to which one is inevi tably led. For it will be noticed that anyone who att empts to expose the secre t forces behind the revo lutionar y movement, whether he m entions Jews in this connex ion or even if he goes out of his wa y to exonerate them, will incur the hostil ity of the Jew s and their friends and will still be described as \"anti- Semite.\" The realization of this fact has led m e parti cularl y to inc lude th e Jew s in the stud y of secret socie ties."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The object of the present book is therefor e to carry further the enquir y I began in World Revolution , by tracing th e course of revolu tionar y ideas through secret socie ties fro m the earliest times, indica ting th e rôle of the Jew s only where it is to be cl early detec ted, but not seeking to i mplicate them where good eviden ce is not forthco ming. For this reason I shall not base assertions on me rely \"anti- Semite\" work s, but principa lly on the writings of the Jews the mselves. In the same way with regard to secre t societ ies I shall rely as far as possible on the docu ments and ad missions of th eir m embers, on which poin t I have been able to co llect a grea t deal of fresh data entir ely corrobora ting my form er thesis.

For w hatever end they may have been employed, the inspirat ion and methods of m ost of those mysterious associa tions which have played so impor tant a part behind the scenes of the world's histor y will be found to have emanated fro m the lands where the first recorded ac ts of the great hu man drama were pl ayed out- -Egypt, Bab ylon, Syria, and Persia. On the one hand E astern m ysticism, on the other Orien tal love of intr igue, fra med the systems later on to be transported to the West with resul ts so tremendous and far -reaching. In the study of secret societies we have then a double line to follow--the course of associa tions envelop ing the mselves in secrec y for the pursuit of esoter ic knowledge, and those using mystery and secre cy for an ult erior and, u sually, a polit ical purpose. But esoteric ism again presents a dual aspect. Here, as in ever y phase of earthl y life, there is the revers de la médaille --white and black, l ight and darkness, the Heaven and Hell of the hum an mind. The quest for hidden knowledge may end with init iation into divine truths or into dark and abom inable cults. Who know s with what forces he m ay be brought in contac t beyond the veil? Initi ation which leads to m aking use of s piritual forces, whether good or evil, is therefore capabl e of raising man to greater heights or of degrad ing hi m to lower depths than he cou ld ever have reach ed by remaining on the purel y physical plane. And w hen men thus unit e themselves in associa tions, a co llective force is generat ed which m ay exerc ise immense influ ence over the world around. Hence the import ance of secret socie ties. Let it be said once and for al l, secret societies have not alwa ys been for med for evil purposes. On the contrar y, many have arisen from the highest aspira tions of the hum an mind--the desire for a knowledge of eterna l veri ties. The evil arising fro m such s ystems has usuall y consisted in the perversion of principl es that once were pure and hol y. If I do not insist further on this point, it is because a vast l iterature has alr eady been devoted to the subject, so that it need only be touched on briefl y here. Now, from the earli est times groups of Initia tes or \"W ise Men\" have exist ed, cla iming to be in pos session of esoteri c doctr ines known as the \"M ysteries,\" inc apabl e of appreh ension b y the vulgar , and relat ing to th e origin and end of m an, the life of the soul after death, and the nature of G od or the gods. It is this exc lusive at titude which consti tutes th e essentia l differen ce betwe en the Initia tes of the ancien t world and the great Teachers of relig ion with who m modern occul tists seek to confound the m. For w hilst religious le aders such as Buddha and Moha mmed sought for divin e knowledge in order that they might impart it to the world, the Init iates believ ed tha t sacred m ysteries should not be reveal ed to the profane but should re main exclusiv ely in their own keep ing, although the desire for ini tiation might spring from the high est aspirat ion, the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"gratification, whether rea l or imaginary, of this desire often led to spiritua l arrogan ce and abominable tyranny, resulting in the fearful tr ials, the tortures physical and mental, ending even at times in dea th, to which the neoph yte was s ubjected by his s uperiors. T HE M YSTERIES According to a theor y current in occul t and mason ic cir cles, cer tain ideas were common to all the m ore importan t \"Mysteries,\" thus for ming a cont inuous tradi tion handed down through succeeding group s of Init iates of dif ferent ages and countr ies. Amongst th ese ideas is said to have been the concep tion of the unity of G od. Whilst to the multitude it was dee med advisabl e to prea ch pol ytheism, since only in this ma nner could the plural aspec ts of the Divine be apprehend ed by the multitude, the Init iates the mselv es believ ed in the exist ence of one Suprem e Being, the Creator of the Universe, pervading and governing all things, Le Plongeon, who se object is to show an af finity between the sacred Mysteries of th e Ma yas and of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Greeks, asserts tha t \"The idea of a sole and om nipot ent Dei ty, who creat ed all things, see ms to have been the universa l belief in early ages, amongst al l the nations tha t had rea ched a high degree of civilization. This was the doctr ine of th e Egyptian priests.\" 11 The sa me writer goes on to say that the \"doctrine of a Suprem e Deity composed of three parts distinc t from each other, yet form ing one, was universal ly preva lent among the civilized nations of America, Asia, and th e Egyptians,\" and tha t the priests and le arned m en of Eg ypt, Chaldea, India, or China \"...kept i t a profound secre t and i mparted it only to a few sele ct among those initiated in the sacred mysteries.\" 12 This view has been expressed b y many other writers, yet lacks histor ical proof. That monoth eism exist ed in Egypt before the da ys of Mose s is, however , certa in. Adolf Erman asserts that \"even in early times the educa ted class\" believ ed all the deiti es of the Egyptian religion to be iden tical and that \"the priests did not shut the ir eyes to this doctr ine, but strove to grasp the idea of the one God, divid ed into different person s by poesy and m yth.... The pri esthood, however , had not the courage to take th e final step, to do awa y with those distinc tions which they declared to be immaterial, and to adore the one God under th e one na me.\" 13 It was left to Amenhot ep IV , later known as Ikhnaton, to procl aim this doctr ine openl y to the people. Professor Breasted has described the hymns of praise to the Sun God which Ikhnaton himself wrote on the walls of the Amarna to mb- chapels: They show us the si mplicity and beaut y of the young king's faith in the sole God. He had gained the belief that one God creat ed not onl y all the lower cre atures but also all races of men, both Eg yptians and foreign ers. Moreover , the king saw in his God a kindl y Father , who m aintained all his crea tures b y his goodness.... In all th e progress of me n which we have followed through thousands of y ears, no one had ever before caugh t such a vision of the great Father of al l. 14 May not the reason wh y Ikhnaton was later describ ed as a \"here tic\" be that he viola ted the code of the priestl y hierarch y by revea ling th is secret doc trine to the profane ? Hence, too, perhaps the nec essity in which the King found hi mself of suppres sing the priesthood,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"which by persisting in i ts exclusive attitude kept what he perceiv ed to be the truth from the minds of the people. The earli est Europe an centr e of the Mysteries appears to have been Greece, where th e Eleusinian Mysteries existed at a very early date. Pythagor as, w ho was born in Sa mos about 582 B.C., spent som e years in Eg ypt, where he was initi ated into the Mysteries of Isis. After his return to Greece, Pythagoras is said to have been ini tiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries and at tempted to found a secret society in Sam os; but th is proving unsuccessful, he journe yed on to Crotona in Italy, where he col lected around him a grea t number of discipl es and final ly estab lished his sect. This wa s divided in to two classes of Initiates--the first admitted only into the exoter ic doctrines of the master, with whom they were not allowed to speak unti l after a period of five y ears' probat ion; th e second consisting of the rea l Initiates, to whom all the mysteries of th e esoteri c doctr ines of Pythagoras were unfolded. This course of instruction, given, aft er the manner of the Egyptians, b y means of im ages and s ymbols, began with geom etrical science, in which Pythagoras during his sta y in Eg ypt had beco me an adept, and led up fina lly to abstruse specul ations conc erning th e trans migration of the soul and the natur e of God, w ho was represen ted under the concep tion of a U niversal Mind dif fused through all things. It is, however , as the precursor of secre t societ ies for med later in the West of Europ e that the sect of Pythagoras enters into the scope of this book. Ear ly masoni c tradi tion traces Freemasonr y partl y to Pythagoras, who is said to have trave lled in Engl and, and ther e is certainly some reason to believ e that his geo metrical ideas enter ed into the s ystem of the opera tive guilds of m asons. T HE J EWISH C ABA LA 15 According to Fabre d'Olivet, Moses, who \"wa s learned in all the wisdo m of the Egyptians,\" drew fro m the Egyptian M ysteries a part of the oral tr adition which was handed down through the le aders of the Israelites. 16 That such an oral tradit ion, distin ct from the writt en word em bodied in the Pentat euch, did descend fro m Moses and that it was lat er committed to writing in the Talmud and the Cabala is the opinion of ma ny Jewish writers. 17 The first for m of th e Talmud, called the Mischna, appeared in about the second or th ird century A.D.; a l ittle later a com mentary was added under the na me of the Gem ara. These two works com pose the Jerusalem Talmud, which was revised in the third to the fifth centry[A]. This later edition was nam ed the Bab ylonian Talmud and is the one now in use.

As a Jewish w riter has expressed it : ... the oddest rabbin ical concei ts are e laborat ed through m any volu mes with the finest dialectic, and the m ost absurd questions are discussed with the highest efforts of intellectua l power; for exam ple, how ma ny white hairs m ay a red cow have, and y et"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"remain a red cow; what sort of scabs require th is or that purifica tion; whether a louse or a flea may be kill ed on the Sabbath--the first being allowed, while the second is a dead ly sin; whether the slaughter of an ani mal ought to be execu ted at the neck or the tail; whether the high priest put on his s hirt or his hose first; whether the Jabam , that is, the brother of a m an who died child less, being requir ed by law to marry the widow , is relieved from his obliga tion if he fal ls off a roof and sticks in the m ire. 18 But it is in the Caba la, a Hebrew word signif ying \"recept ion,\" tha t is to sa y \"a doctrine orally received,\" that th e specula tive and philosophic al or ra ther the theosophica l doctr ines of Israel are to be found. These are con tained in two books, the Sepher Y etzirah and the Zohar . The Sepher Y etzirah , or Book of the Crea tion, is de scribed b y Edershe im as \"a monologu e on the part of Abraha m, in which, by the con templation of all that is around him, he ult imately arrives at the conc lusion of the unity of God\" 19 ; but since this process is accomplished b y an arrange ment of the Divin e Emanations under the na me of the Ten Sephiroths, and in the perm utation of num erals and of the le tters of th e Hebrew alphabe t, it would cert ainly conve y no such idea- -nor probabl y indeed an y idea a t all--to the mind unini tiated in to Cabal istic systems. The Sepher Yetzirah is in fac t admittedly a work of extraordinar y obscurity 20 and al most certainly of extre me antiquity. Mon sieur Paul Vulliaud, in his exhaust ive work on the Cabala recent ly published, 21 says that its date has been placed as earl y as the sixth cen tury before Christ and as la te as the tenth centur y A.D., but that it is at an y rate older than the Talmud is shown b y the fac t that in the Talmud the Rabbis are describ ed as stud ying it for m agical purpo ses. 22 The Sepher Yetzirah is also said to be th e work referred to in the Koran under the na me of the \"Book of Abraha m.\" 23 The immense co mpilation known as the Sepher -Ha-Z ohar , or Book of Ligh t, is, however , of grea ter importanc e to th e stud y of Cabal istic philosoph y. According to the Zohar itself, the \"Mysteries of Wisdom\" were imparted to Adam by God whilst he was stil l in the Garden of Ed en, in the form of a book delivered by the angel Raz ael. From Adam the book passed on to Seth, then to Enoch, to Noah, to Abraha m, and lat er to Moses, one of its principa l exponents. 24 Other Jewish writers dec lare, howeve r, that Moses rece ived it for the first ti me on Mount Sina i and co mmunicated it to the Sevent y Elders, b y whom it was handed down to David and Solom on, then to Ezr a and Nehe miah, and finall y to the Rabbis of the earl y Christian era. 25 Until this dat e the Zohar had remained a purel y oral trad ition, but now for the first ti me it is said to have been written down by the discipl es of Sim on ben Jochai. The Talmud relates tha t for twelv e years the Rabbi Si mon and his son Eli ezer conceal ed the mselves in a cavern, where, sit ting in the sand up to their necks, the y meditated on the sacred law and were frequentl y visited by the prophet Elias. 26 In this way, Jewish leg end adds, the great book of the Zohar was com posed and committed to writing by the Rabbi's son Eliezer and his secre tary the Rabbi Abba. 27"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The first date at which the Zohar is defini tely known to have appe ared is the end of the thirteenth centur y, when it was committed to writing b y a Spanish Je w, Moses de Leon, who, accord ing to Dr .

Je wish opin ion is strongl y divided on this question, one bod y maintaining tha t the Zohar is the compar atively modern work of Moses de Leon, the other declaring it to be of extr eme antiqui ty. M. Vulliaud, who has collated all these vi ews in the course of so me fifty pages, shows that a lthough the name Zohar might have orig inated with Mose s de Leon, the ideas i t embodi ed were far older than the th irteen th cen tury. How , he asks pertinen tly, would it have been possible for the Rabbis of the Middle Ages to have been dece ived in to acc epting as an ancien t docu ment a work tha t was of com pletely modern orig in? 29 Obviousl y the Zohar was not the composi tion of M oses de Leon, but a co mpilation m ade by him from various docu ments dating fro m very early times. Moreover , as M . Vulliaud goes on to expl ain, those who deny its antiqu ity are the anti-Caba lists, head ed by Graetz, whose object is to prove the Caba la to be at variance with orthodox Judais m. Theodore Rein ach goes so far as to declare the Caba la to be \"a subtle poison w hich enters in to the veins of Judaism and wholl y infests it\"; Salo mon Reinach calls i t \"one of the worst aberrat ions of the hu man mind.\" 30 This view , many a student of the Cabala will hardl y dispute, but to sa y that it is foreign to Judaism is ano ther m atter. The fact is tha t the main ideas of the Zohar find confir mation in th e Talmud. As the Jewish Enc yclopæd ia observes, \"the Cabala is not really in oppo sition to the Talmud,\" and \" many Talmudic Jews have supported and contr ibuted to it.\" 31 Adolphe Franck does not hesi tate to describe it as \"the heart and lif e of Judais m.\" 32 \"The greater num ber of th e most eminent Rabbis of the seventeen th and eighteenth centur ies bel ieved firmly in the sacredn ess of th e Zohar and the inf allibility of its teach ing.\" 33 The question of the antiqu ity of the Cabal a is ther efore in reali ty largely a matter of names. That a mystical trad ition existed amongst the Jews fro m remote antiqui ty will hardl y be denied by anyone 34 ; it is therefore, as M . Vulliaud observes, \"onl y a matter of knowing at what m oment Jewish m ysticism took the na me of Cabal a.\" 35 Edershei m asserts tha t-- It is undeniabl e that, already at the ti me of Jesus Christ, there existed an assem blage of doctr ines and specul ations th at were carefull y concea led from the m ultitude. They were not even revea led to ordinar y scholars, for fear of lead ing the m towards heret ical ideas. This kind bore the name of K abbalah, and as the term (of Kabbalah, to rece ive, trans mit) indicates, it represen ted the spiritua l trad itions tr ansm itted fro m the ear liest ages, although m ingled in the course of time with i mpur e or foreign elements. 36 Is the Cabala, then, as Gougenot des Mous seaux asserts, older than the Jewish race, a legacy handed down from the first patriar chs of the world? 37 We must admit this hypothesis to be incap able of proof, y et it is one tha t has found so mu ch favour with students of occult tradit ions that it cannot be ignored. The Jewish Cabal a itse lf supports it by tracing i ts descent from the pa triarchs- -Adam, Noah, Enoch, and Abraham --who liv ed before the Jews as a separate race came into exist ence.

Sorcer y, as we know , had been prac tised b y the Canaani tes before the occup ation of Palestine by the Israel ites; Egypt India, and Greece also had th eir soothsa yers and div iners. In spite of the i mprecations against sorcer y contained in the law of Mo ses, the Jews, disregarding these warnings, caugh t the contagion and mingled the sacred tradi tion they had inher ited with m agical ideas par tly borrowed fro m other races and partl y of their own devising. At the same time the specul ative side of the Jewish Caba la borrowed fro m the philosoph y of the Persian Magi, of the Neo-Platonists, 40 and of the Neo-P ythagor eans. There is, then, som e justific ation for the anti- Cabalists' cont ention that what we know to-da y as the Cabala is not of purel y Jewish origin. Gougenot des Mous seaux, who had ma de a profound stud y of occul tism, asserts tha t there were ther efore two Caba las: th e anci ent sacred tradi tion handed down from the first patriarchs of the hum an race; and the ev il Caba la, wherein this sacred tradit ion was mingled by the Rabbis with barbaric superst itions, co mbined with their own imaginings and henceforth marked with their seal. 41 This view also finds expression in the remarkable work of the conver ted Jew Drach, who refers to-- The ancien t and tru e Cabal a, which ... we distingu ish from the modern Caba la, false, conde mnable, and conde mned b y the Holy See, the work of the Rabbis, who have also falsif ied and perverted the Talmudic tradit ion. The doc tors of the S ynagogue trace it back to Moses, whilst at the sa me time admitting that the principa l truths i t conta ins were those known b y revel ation to the first patri archs of the world. 42 Further on D rach quotes the state ment of Sixtus of Sienn a, another converted Jew and a Dominican, prot ected by Pius V: Since by the decr ee of th e Hol y Roman Inquisition all book s apper taining to the Cabala have lately been conde mned, one m ust know tha t the Cabala is double; that one is true, the other fa lse. The true and pious one is tha t which ... elucida tes the secret mysteries of the holy law ac cording to the prin ciple of anagog y (i.e. figurat ive interpre tation). This Caba la ther efore th e Church has never conde mned. The false and i mpious Cabala is a certain mendacious kind of Jewish tradit ion, full of innu merable vaniti es and falsehoods, differing but l ittle fro m necrom ancy. This kind of supersti tion, th erefore, improperl y called Cabala, the Church within the last few y ears has deserved ly conde mned. 43 The modern Jewish Cabal a presents a dua l aspect- -theoret ical and prac tical; the for mer concerned with theosophica l specula tions, the latter with magical prac tices.

Thus the Zohar expla ins that Noah was lamed for lif e by the bite of a lion whilst he was in the ark, 47 the adventures of Jonah inside the whale are relat ed with an extraordin ary wealth of imagination, 48 whilst the beautifu l stor y of El isha and the Shunnam ite wom an is travestied in the most grotesque m anner. 49 In the pract ical Cabala this m ethod of \"decod ing\" is reduced to a theur gic or m agical system in which the healing of diseases pla ys an importan t part and is ef fected by means of the mystical arrang ement of nu mbers and letters, b y the pronunci ation of the Inef fable Name, by the use of a mulets and talismans, or b y compounds suppo sed to conta in cer tain occult proper ties. All these ideas derived fro m very ancient cu lts; even the ar t of working m iracles b y the use of the Divine Na me, which after the appropriat ion of the Cabala by the Jews beca me the parti cular practi ce of Jewish m iracle-workers, appears to have orig inated in Chald ea. 50 Nor can th e insistenc e on the Chosen People theor y, which for ms the basis of all Talmudic and Cabal istic writings, be regarded as of purel y Jewish origin ; the ancien t Egyptians lik ewise beli eved th emselves to be \"the peculi ar people specia lly loved by the gods.\" 51 But in the hand s of th e Jew s this belief beca me a pret ension to the exclusiv e enjoyment of divine favour . According to the Zoha r, \"all Israeli tes will have a par t in the future world,\" 52 and on arrival there will not be handed over like th e goyim (or non- Jewish races) to the hands of the angel Douma and sent down to Hell. 53 Indeed the goyim are even deni ed hu man attribu tes. Thus the Zohar again expla ins that the words of the Scriptur e \"Jehovah E lohim made man\" mean that He ma de Israel. 54 The sevente enth- century Rabbin ical treatise E mek ha Melek observes: \"Our Rabbis of blessed m emory have said: 'Y e Jew s are men bec ause of the soul ye have fro m the Supre me Man (i.e. God).

Vetus et constans opinio , as Suetonius says. It is of a ll times and of all pl aces. 56 And Drach goes on to quote the evidence of Volney, who had travel led in the East and declared that- - The sacred and m ythologi cal tradit ions of earl ier times had spread throughout al l Asia the belief in a great Mediator who was to co me, of a future Saviour , King, God, Conqueror , and Legisla tor who w ould bring back the Golden Age to earth and del iver m en from the empire of ev il. 57 All that can be said with an y degree of certa inty with regard to this bel ief is tha t it did exist amongst th e Zoroastri ans of Persia as well as am ongst the Jews. D 'Herbelo t, quoting Abulfaraj, show s that five hundred y ears before Christ, Zerdasch t, the leader of the Zoroastr ians, predic ted the co ming of the Messiah, a t who se birth a star w ould appear . He also told his discip les that the Messiah would be born of a vir gin, tha t they would be the first to hear of Hi m, and that they should bring Him gifts. 58 Drach be lieves that th is tradi tion was taught in the ancien t synagogue, 59 thus explain ing the word s of St. Paul that unto the Jews \" were committed the oracles of God\" 60 : This oral doctr ine, which is the Cabal a, had for i ts object the most subli me truths of the Faith which it brought back incessantl y to the prom ised Rede emer, the foundat ion of the whole system of the anc ient tradi tion. 61 Drach furth er asserts that the doctr ine of the Trinity form ed a part of th is tradit ion: Whoever has fam iliarized hims elf with that which was taught b y the anci ent doc tors of the Synagogu e, part icular ly those who liv ed before the co ming of the Saviour , know s that the Trinity in one God was a truth ad mitted amongst them from the earli est times. 62 M.

But in the te aching of the la ter synagogue th e philosoph y of the earlier sages was narrowed down to suit the exclusive system of the Jewish hierarch y, and the ancien t hope of a Redee mer who s hould restore Man to the state of feli city he had lost at the Fall was transfor med into the idea of salva tion for th e Jew s alon e 67 under the ægis of a triu mphant and even an aveng ing Messiah. 68 It is this Messianic dream perpetua ted in the m odern Cabala which nine teen hundred years ago the advent of Christ on earth came to disturb. T HE C OMING OF THE R EDE EMER The fact that many Christi an doctrin es, such as the conc eption of a Trinity, the miraculous birth and m urder of a Deit y, had found a pla ce in earli er rel igions has frequent ly been used as an ar gument to show that the story of Christ wa s merely a new version of various ancient legends, those of Attis, Adonis, or of Osiris, and tha t consequent ly the Christian religion is founded on a m yth. The answer to this is that th e existen ce of Christ on earth is an historic fac t which no serious au thorit y has ever denied. The at tempts of s uch writers as Drew s and J.M. Robertson to establish th e theor y of the \"Christ- Myth,\" which find an echo in the utteran ces of Social ist orators, 69 have been m et with so much able criticism as to need no further refutat ion. Sir Ja mes Fraze r, who will cer tainly not be accused of bigot ed orthodox y, observes in this connex ion: The doubts w hich have been cast on the histori cal reali ty of Jesu s are, in m y judgement, unworth y of serious at tention.... To dissolve the founder of Christian ity into a m yth, as some would do, is hardl y less absurd than it would be to do the sa me for Moham med, Luther, and Calvin. 70 May not the fact that certa in cir cumstanc es in the life of Christ were foreshadowed b y earlier religions indica te, as El iphas Lév i observes, that the anc ients had an intu ition of Christi an mysteries? 71 To those ther efore who had adher ed to th e anci ent tr adition, Christ appe ared as the fulfilment of a prophec y as old as the world. Thus the wise m en came from afar to worship the Babe of Bethl ehem, and when the y saw His star in the East they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. In Christ they hailed not only Him who was born King of the Jews, but the Saviour of the whole hum an race. 72 In the light of this grea t hope, tha t wondrous night in Bethlehe m is seen in all its sublimity. Throughout the ages the seers had looked for the coming of the Rede emer, and lo! He w as here; but it was not to the mighty in Israel, to the High P riests and the Scribes, that His birth was announced, but to humb le shepherds watch ing the ir flocks b y night. And these m en of si mple faith, hearing from the angels \"the good tidings of grea t joy\" that a Saviour , \"Christ the Lord\" was born, went with haste to see the babe l ying in th e"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"manger, and returned \"glor ifying and praising God.\" So also to the devout in Israel, to Simeon and to Anna the prophe tess, the grea t event appeared in its universal signif icanc e, and Simeon, depar ting in peace, knew that his e yes had seen the salvation that was to be \"a light to light en the Gentiles\" as wel l as the glory of the peop le of Israel. But to the Jews, in who se hands the anc ient tradit ion had been turned to the exc lusive advan tage of the Jewish race, to the Rabb is, who had, moreover , constitut ed the mselves the sole guardians within this nation of the said trad ition, the manner of i ts fulfil ment was necessarily abhorren t. Instead of a resplendent Messiah who should be presented b y them to the peopl e, a Saviour was born a mongst the peopl e themselves and brought to Jerusale m to be presented to the Lord; a Saviour moreover who, as ti me went on, imparted His divine m essage to the poor and hum ble and decl ared th at His Kingdo m was not of this world. This was clear ly what Mar y meant when she said th at God had \"scattered the proud in the imagination of the ir hear ts,\" that He had \"put down the m ighty from their seats, and exal ted the m of low degre e.\" Christ was therefor e doubl y hateful to the Jewish hi erarch y in that He atta cked the privil ege of th e race to which the y belonged by throwing open the door to all mankind, and the priv ilege of the caste to which they belong ed by revea ling sacred doctrin es to the profane and destro ying their claim to exclusive knowledge. Unless viewed fro m this aspect, neither the antagonis m displa yed by the Scribes and Pharisees towards our Lord nor the denunc iations He uttered against them can be properl y understood. \"W oe unto y ou, Law yers! for y e have tak en awa y the key of knowledge : ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hinder ed.... Woe unto y ou, Scrib es and Pharisees, h ypocrites! for y e shut up the kingdom of heav en against m en: tor y e neither go in y ourselves, nei ther suf fer ye them that are entering to go in.\" What did Christ me an by the ke y of kno wledg e? Cle arly the sacred trad ition which, as Drach expl ains, foreshadowed the doctrin es of Christiani ty. 73 It was the Rabbis who perver ted tha t trad ition, and thus \"the guilt of these perfid ious D octors consisted in their concealing from the people the trad itional exp lanation of the sacred books b y means of which they would have been able to recogn ize the Mes siah in the person of Je sus Christ.\" 74 Man y of the people, however , did recogn ize Him ; inde ed, the multitude acclaimed Him, spreading the ir gar ments before Him and cr ying, \"Hosanna to the Son of David! Bles sed is He that cometh in the name of th e Lord!\" Writers who have ci ted th e choice of Barabb as in the place of Christ as an instan ce of m isguided popular judgement, overlook the fac t that this choice was not spontan eous; it was the Chief Priests who delivered Christ \"fro m env y\" and who \"mov ed the people that Pil ate should rather release unto them Barabbas.\" Then the peopl e obedi ently cried out, \"Crucif y Him!\" So also it was the Rabbis who, after hiding from the peop le the meaning of the sacred tradition at the moment of its fulfil ment, afterwards poisoned tha t same stream for futur e gener ations. Abominable calumnies on Christ and Christian ity occur not onl y in the Caba la but in the earli er edit ions of the Talmud. In these, says Barc lay-- Our Lord and Saviour is \"that one,\" \"such a one,\" \"a fool,\" \"the leper ,\" \"the dece iver of Israel,\" etc. Efforts are m ade to prove that He is the son of J oseph Pandira before his"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"marriage with Mar y.

In the long series of Sacred Books of the East the Talmud finds no place. All that is accessible to the ordin ary reader consists, on one hand, in expur gated versions or judicious sele ctions b y Jewish and pro-Jewish com pilers, and, on the other hand, in \"anti- Semitic\" public ations on which it would be dangerous to plac e reliance. The princ ipal English transla tion b y Rodkinson is ver y incomplete, and the folios are nowhere indicated, so that it is i mpossibl e to look up a passage. 76 The French transl ation by Jean de Paul y[B] profes ses to present the entire text of the Venetian Talmud of 1520, but it does nothing of the kind. 77 The translator , in the Preface, in fact admits that he has left out \"steri le discussions\" and has throughout attempted to tone down \"the bruta lity of certa in expressions which of fend our ears.\" This of course af fords him infin ite latitude, so that all passages like ly to prove displeasing to the \"Hébra isants,\" to who m his work is particularly dedicated, are discreetl y expunged. Jean de Paul y's translat ion of the Cabala appears, ho weve r, to be complete. 78 But a fair and honest render ing of the whole Talmud into English or French still remains to be m ade. Moreover , even the Hebrew s cholar is obliged to exer cise som e discrim ination if he desires to consult the Talmud in its origin al for m. For b y the sixteen th cen tury, when the study of Hebrew beca me gener al amongst Christi ans, the ant isocia l and ant i-Christi an tendencies of the Talmud attra cted the at tention of the Censor , and in th e Bâle Talmud of 1581 the most obnoxious passages and the entire treatise Abodah Zara were suppressed. 79 In the Cracow edit ion of 1604 tha t followed, these passages were restored by the Jews, a proce eding which aroused s o much indigna tion amongst Christi an students of Hebrew that the Jews beca me alarmed. According ly a Jewish s ynod, assembled in Poland in 1631, ordered the of fending passages to be expunged again, but- -according to Drach--to be replaced by circl es which the Rabbis were to fil l in orall y when giv ing instruc tion to young Jews. 80 After that date the Talmud was for a time carefu lly bowdleri zed, so tha t in order to discover i ts original form it is advisabl e to go back to the Venetian Talmud of 1520 before any omissions were m ade, or to consult a modern edition.

Origen, who in the middle of the th ird centur y wrote his repl y to the attack of Celsus on Christi anity, refers to a scandalous stor y closel y resem bling the Toledo t Yeshu, which Celsus, who lived towards the end of the second centur y, had quoted on the author ity of a Jew . 84 It is evident, therefore, that the leg end it conta ins had long been curren t in Jewish circ les, but th e book itself did not come into the hands of Christians until it was translated into Latin by Raymond Mart in. Lat er on Luth er sum marized it in German under the name of Schem Hampho rasch ; Wagensei l in 1681 and Huldrich in 1705 published Latin transla tions. 85 It is also to be found in French in Gu stave Brunei's Evang iles Apocryph es . However repugnant it is to transcrib e any portion of this blasphe mous w ork, i ts ma in outline must be given here in order to trac e the subsequent course of the anti- Christian secre t tradi tion in which, as we shall see, it has been perpetua ted up to our own da y. Brief ly, then, the Toledo t Yeshu rel ates with the m ost indecen t deta ils tha t Miria m, a hairdr esser of Bethleh em, 86 affianced to a young man named Jochanan, was seduced b y a libertine, Joseph Panther or Pandira, and gave birth to a son w hom she na med Johosuah or Jeschu. Accord ing to the Talmudi c authors of the Sota and the Sanhedri m, Jeschu wa s taken during his bo yhood to Egypt, where he wa s initiated into the secret doctrines of th e priests, and on his return to Palestine gave hi mself up to the prac tice of ma gic. 87 The Toledo t Yeshu, however , goes on to say that on reaching manhood Jeschu learn t the secret of his il legitimacy, on account of w hich he was driven out of the S ynagogue and took refuge for a ti me in Galile e. Now , there was in the Temple a stone on which was engraved the Tetragra mmaton or Schem Hamphorasch, that is to sa y, the Ineffable Nam e of God; this stone had been found b y King David when the foundat ions of the Temple were being prepar ed and was deposited by him in the Hol y of Holies. Jeschu, knowing th is, ca me from Galile e and, pene trating into the Hol y of Holies, read the Ineffable Name, which he transcr ibed on to a piec e of parch ment and concea led in an incision under his skin. B y this means he was able to work mi racles and to persuade the people that he wa s the son of God foretold by Isaiah. With the aid of Judas, the Sage s of th e Synagogue succeed ed in capturing Jeschu, who was then led before the Great and Little Sanhedr im, by whom he was conde mned to be stoned to death and fina lly hanged."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Such is the story of Christ accord ing to the Jewish Cabalists, which should be co mpar ed not only with the Christian tradi tion but with that of the Moslems.

Thus the Jewish historian Graetz declares that Jesus sim ply appropri ated to hi mself the essential features of Essenism , and that pri mitive Christ ianity was \"nothing but an of fshoot of Essenis m.\" 95 The Christian Jew Dr .

Of course if this were true, if the miracles of Christ were simp ly due to a knowledge of natur al laws and His doctr ines were the outco me of a sect, the whole theor y of His divine power and mission falls to the ground. This is why it is essential to expose th e fall acies and even th e bad fai th on which th e attempt to iden tify Him with the Essenes is based. Now, we have onl y to stud y the Gospels carefu lly in order to rea lize that the teachings of Christ were tota lly different fro m those pecul iar to the Essenes. 98 Christ did not live in a fraternity, but, as Dr .

A further point, the most conclusive of al l, Dr. Ginsbur g ignores, na mely, that one of the princ ipal traits of the Essenes which dist inguished the m from the other Jewish sects of th eir da y was their disapprova l of oint ment, which they regarded as defi ling, whilst Christ not onl y commended the wom an who brought the precious jar of oint ment, but reproach ed Si mon for the omission: \"My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath ano inted My feet with oint ment.\" It is obvious that if Christ had been an Essene but had depar ted from His usual custom on this occ asion out of deference to the woman's fee lings, he would have understood wh y Simon had not offered Hi m the same attention, and at an y rate Simon would have excused hi mself on these grounds. F urthe r, if His discipl es had been Essenes, would they not have protested against this viola tion of their principl es, instead of m erely objecting that the oin tment was of too costl y a kind ? But it is in attribu ting to Christ the Com munistic doctr ines of the Essenes that Dr. Ginsbur g's conclusions are the most misleading- -a point of par ticular impor tance in view of the fact that it is on this false h ypothesis tha t so-cal led \"Christ ian Socia lism\" has been built up. \"The Essenes,\" he writes, \"had al l things in co mmon, and appoin ted one of the brethr en as steward to manage the co mmon bag; so the primitive Christians (Acts i i. 44, 45, iv . 32-4; John xii. 6, xi ii. 29).\" It is perfect ly true that, as the first reference to the Acts testifies, so me of the pri mitive Christi ans after the dea th of Christ for med themselves into a body having al l things in common, but there is not the slightest evidence that Christ and His discipl es followed th is principl e. The solitary passages in the Go spel of St. John, which are all that Dr. Ginsbu rg can quote in support of this cont ention, may have referred to an al ms-bag or a fund for cert ain expenses, not to a co mmon pool of all mon etary wealth. Stil l less is there any evidence that Christ advocat ed Co mmunism to th e world in gener al. When the y oung m an having grea t posse ssions asked what he should do to inher it eternal life, Christ told him to follow the commandments, but on the y oung m an asking what more he could do, answered: \"If thou wilt be perfect go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor .\" Renuncia tion--but not the pooling--of al l weal th was thus a counsel of perfect ion for the few w ho desired to devot e their lives to God, a s monks and nuns have a lways done, and bore no rel ation to the Com munistic system of the Essenes. Dr. Ginsbur g goes on to sa y: \"Essenis m put all its m embers on the same leve l, forbidding the exercise of authori ty of one over the other and enjoining m utual service; so Christ (Matt. xx. 25-8; Mark ix. 35-7, x. 42-5). Essenis m commanded its disc iples to call no man master upon the ear th; so Christ (Mat t. xxii i. 8-10).\" As a m atter of fact, Christ strongl y upheld the exercise of authori ty, not only in the oft-quoted passage, \"Render to Cæsar the things tha t are Cæsar's,\" but in His approval of the Centurion's s peech: \"I am a man under author ity, having soldiers under me: and I sa y to this m an, Go, and he goeth ; and to another , Com e, and he co meth; and to m y servant, Do this, and he doeth it.\" Everywher e Christ co mmends the faithfu l servant and en joins obed ience to m asters. If we look up the referen ce to the Gospel of St. Matth ew where Dr . Ginsbur g says that Christ commanded His discip les to call no ma n master on earth, we shall find that he has not only perverted the sense of the passage but reversed the order of the word s, which,"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"following on a denunc iation of the Jewish Rabbis, runs thus: \"But be not y e called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Christ, and all ye are brethr en.... Neither be ye called masters: for one is y our master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among y ou shall be your servant.\" The apostles were therefore, never ordered to ca ll no m an master, but not to be cal led m aster the mselves. Moreover , if we refer to the Greek tex t, we shall see that this was meant in a spiritua l and not a social sense. The word for \"m aster\" here given is in the first verse διδ ά σκαλος, i.e. teacher, in the second, καθηγητ ὴ ς literally guide, and the word is servant is διακ ὸ νοσ. When m asters and servants in the socia l sense are referr ed to in the Gospels, the word e mplo yed for m aster is κ ύ ριος and for servant δο ῦ λος. Dr. Ginsbur g should have been aware of this distinct ion and tha t the passage in question had therefore no bear ing on his ar gument. As a m atter of fact it would appear that some of the apostl es kept servants, since Christ co mmends the m for exac ting strict a ttention to duty: Which of y ou, having a servant plough ing or feeding cattle, will sa y unto him by and b y, when he is co me from the fie ld, Go and sit down to m eat? And will not rather say unto him, Make read y wherewi th I m ay sup, and gird th yself, and serve m e, till I have ea ten and drunken; and aft erwards thou shalt eat and drink ? Doth he thank tha t servant because he did the th ings that were com manded to him? I trow not. 99 This passage would alone suf fice to sho w that Christ and His apostles did not inhabi t communities where al l were equa l, but followed the usual pract ices of the social system under which they lived, though adopting certain rules, such as taking only one garm ent and carrying no m oney when the y went on journe ys. Those rese mblances betwe en the teaching of the Essenes and the Serm on on the Mount which Dr . Ginsbur g indica tes refer not to the customs of a sect, but to genera l prec epts for hu man conduct--hu mility, meekness, charit y, and so forth. At the same time it is cl ear tha t if the Essenes in gener al confor med to some of the princ iples l aid down b y Christ, cer tain of their doctrines were completely at vari ance with those of Christ and of pri mitive Christians, in parti cular their custom of pra ying to the rising sun and their disbe lief in the resurrec tion of the bod y. 100 St. Paul denounces asceticism, the cardinal doctrin e of the Essenes, in unm easured terms, warning th e brethr en tha t \"in the latter times some shall depar t from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrin es of devils, ... forbidding to m arry, and co mmanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiv ing of the m which bel ieve and know the truth. For ever y creatur e of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving ... If thou put the brethren in re membranc e of these things, thou shalt be a good mi nister of Jesu s Christ.\" This would suggest th at cer tain Essenean ide as had crept into Christ ian co mmunities and were regard ed by those who re membered Christ' s true teaching as a dangerous perversion. The Essenes were therefore not Christi ans, but a secre t societ y, pract ising four degre es of initiation, and bound b y terrib le oaths not to divulg e the sacred m ysteries confided to them. And what were those m ysteries but those of the Jewish s ecret trad ition which we"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"now know as the Cabal a? Dr. Ginsbur g throws an i mport ant light on Essenis m when, in one passage alone, he refers to the obliga tion of the Essenes \"not to divu lge the secret doctr ines to an yone, ... carefu lly to preserve the book s belong ing to their sect and the names of the ange ls or the m ysteries conne cted with the Tetragrammaton and the other names of G od and the ange ls, com prised in the theosoph y as well as with the cos mogon y which also pla yed so impor tant a part among the Jewish m ystics and the Kabbalists.\" 101 The truth is c learly that the Essenes were Caba lists, though doubtless Cabalists of a superior kind. The Caba l they possessed ver y possibly descended from pre-Christi an times and had remained unconta minated by the anti- Christian strain in troduced into it by the Rabbis after the death of Christ. 102 The Essenes are of i mpor tance to the subject of this book as the first of the secre t socie ties fro m which a dire ct line of trad ition can be traced up to the present da y. But if in this peaceful community no actual ly anti-Christi an influ ence is to be discerned, the sa me canno t be said of the succeed ing pseudo-Christi an sects which, whilst profes sing Christi anity, mingled with Christian doctrines the poison of the perverted Cabala, main source of th e errors which hencefor th rent the Christ ian Church in twain. T HE G NOSTICS The first school of though t to cre ate a schism in Christiani ty was the col lection of sects known under the generic name of G nostic ism. In its purer forms Gnosticism aimed at supple menting faith by knowledg e of et ernal veriti es and at giving a wider me aning to Christi anity by linking it up with earl ier fai ths. \"The bel ief that th e divin ity had been manifested in the religious institut ions of all nations\" 103 thus led to the conc eption of a sort of universa l religion cont aining the div ine el ements of all. Gnosticis m, however , as the Jewish Enc yclopæd ia points out, \"was J ewish in char acter long before it beca me Christi an.\" 104 M. Mat ter indi cates Syria and Palest ine as i ts cradle and Alexandri a as the centre by which it was influ enced at the time of its al liance with Christi anity. This influ ence again was predo minantly Jewish. Philo and Aristobulus, th e leading Jewish philosophers of Alexandria, \"whol ly attached to the ancien t religion of their fath ers, both resolved to adorn it with the spoils of other s ystems and to open to Judais m the wa y to immense conquests.\" 105 This m ethod of borrowing fro m other races and religions those ideas useful for th eir purpose has alwa ys been the custo m of the Jews. The Cabala, as we have seen, was m ade up of these het erogeneous el ements. And it is here we find the principa l progeni tor of Gno sticism. The Free mason Ragon gives the clue in the words: \"The Caba la is th e key of the occul t scienc es. The Gno stics were born of the Caba lists.\" 106 For the Cabala was much older th an the Gnostics. Modern histor ians who date it merely from the publi cation of the Zohar b y Mose s de Leon in the thir teenth centur y or from the school of Luria in the sixte enth centur y obscure this mos t impor tant fact which Jewish savants have alwa ys clearly, recogniz ed. 107 The Jewish Encyc lopædia , whilst den ying the certainty of connexion between Gnostic ism and th e Cabal a, neverth eless ad mits that the invest igations of the ant i-Caba list Graet z \"must be resum ed on a new basis,\" and it goes"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"on to show that \"it was Alexandria of the first centur y, or earlie r, with her strange commingling of Eg yptian, Cha ldean, Judean, and Greek cul ture which furnished s oil and seeds for tha t mystic philosoph y.\" 108 But since Alexandri a was at the same period the home of Gno sticism, which was formed from the same elements enum erated here, the connex ion between the two s ystems is cl early evident. M. Matter is th erefore right in saying that Gnostic ism was not a defec tion from Christian ity, but a co mbination of systems into which a few Christi an elements were introduced. The result of Gno sticism was thus not to christian ize the Cabal a, but to cabal ize Christian ity by mingling its pure and simp le teaching with theosoph y and even m agic. The Jewish Enc yclopæd ia quotes the opinion that \"th e centr al doc trine of G nostic ism--a m ovement closel y connect ed with Jewish m ysticism--was nothing else than th e attempt to lib erate the soul and unite it with God\"; but as this wa s appar ently to be ef fected \"through the employment of m ysteries, incantations, na mes of angels,\" etc., it will be seen how widel y even th is phase of Gnosticis m differs from Christi anity and iden tifies itself with the m agical Caba la of the Jews. Indeed, the m an genera lly recogn ized as the founder of Gnostic ism, a Jew com monly known as Sim on Magus, wa s not only a Caba list mystic but avowedl y a magician, who with a band of Jew s, inc luding his mas ter Dositheus and his disciples Menander and Cerin thus, institu ted a priesthood of the Mysteries and prac tised occu lt arts and exorc isms. 109 It was this Simon of whom we read in the Acts of the Apostles that he \"bewit ched the people of Sam aria, giving out that himself was some great one : to who m they all gave heed from the least to the grea test, saying, This ma n is th e great power of God,\" and who sought to purchase the power of the laying on of hands with mo ney. Simon, indeed, crazed by his incanta tions and ecstasies, deve loped m egalomania in an acute for m, arrogating to hi mself divin e honours and aspiring to the adora tion of the whole world. According to a conte mporar y legend, he eventual ly became sorcer er to Nero and ended his life in Ro me. 110 The prevalen ce of sorcer y amongst the Jews during the first cen tury of the Christian era is shown b y other passages in the Acts of the Apostles; in Papho s the \"false prophet,\" a Jew, who se surname was Bar -Jesus, otherwise known as \"El ymas the sorcerer ,\" opposed the teach ing of St. Paul and brought on hi mself the imprecation: \"O full of all subtl ety and all m ischief, thou child of the dev il, thou enemy of all righ teousness, wilt thou not cease to perver t the right wa ys of the Lord ?\" Perversion is the ke ynote of all the debased forms of Gno sticism. According to Eliphas Lévi, certain of the Gnostics introdu ced into their rites th at profana tion of Christian mysteries which was to for m the basis of black magic in th e Middle Ages. 111 The glorif ication of ev il, which plays so im portan t a part in the modern revo lutionar y movement, constitu ted the creed of the Ophites, who wor shipp ed the Serpent ( ὅ φις) because he had revo lted against Jehovah, to whom they referred under the Cabal istic term of the \"dem iurgus,\" 112 and stil l more of the Cain ites, so-cal led fro m their cult of Cain, whom , with Dathan and Abiram, the inhabi tants of Sodo m and G omorrah, and fina lly Judas Iscariot, they regard ed as noble victi ms of the de miurgus. 113 Animated by hatred of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"all socia l and m oral order , the Cain ites \"ca lled upon all men to destro y the works of G od and to com mit ever y kind of infa my.\" 114 These men were th erefore not onl y the enemies of Christian ity but of orthodox Judaism , since it was against the Jehovah of the Jew s that the ir hatr ed was particu larly direct ed. Another Gnostic sect, the Carpocrat ians, followers of Carpocr ates of Alexandria and his son Epiphanus- -who died from his debauch eries and was venera ted as a god 115 --likewise regard ed all written laws, Christian or M osaic, with cont empt and recogni zed onl y the γν ῶ σις or kno wledg e given to the great men of ever y nation- -Plato and P ythagor as, Moses and Christ--which \"frees one from all that the vulgar cal l religion\" and \"m akes man equal to God.\" 116 So in the Carpocra tians of the second centur y we find alre ady the tendenc y towards that deification of humanity which forms the suprem e doctrine of the secre t societ ies and of the visionar y Soci alists of our da y. The war now begins between the two cont ending princ iples: the Christ ian conc eption of ma n reaching up to God and the secret societ y conception of ma n as God, needing no revela tion fro m on high and no guidan ce but the law of his o wn natur e. And since that nature is in itself divine, all th at springs fro m it is praiseworth y, and those ac ts usuall y regarded as sins are not to be conde mned. B y this line of reasoning the Carpocr atians arrived a t much the sa me conclusions as m odern Communists with regard to the ideal social system. Thus Epiphanus held that since Nature herself reve als the principl e of the community and the unit y of all things, hu man laws which are contrar y to this l aw of Nature are so many culpab le infra ctions of the legitimate order of things. Before these laws w ere imposed on hu manity everything was in common--land, goods, and wom en. According to certain conte mporaries, the Carpocr atians returned to this pri mitive system by instituting the community of wom en and indulging in ever y kind of licen ce. The further Gnostic sect of Antitacts, following th is sam e cult of hu man nature, taught revol t against all positive relig ion and laws and the necessit y for gratif ying the flesh; the Adamites of North Africa, going a step further in the return to Nature, cast of f all cloth ing at their relig ious services so as to represent the pri mitive innoc ence of the garden of Eden- -a preced ent fol lowed b y the Adam ites of Germ any in the fift eenth centur y. 117 These Gnostics, says Eliphas Lév i, under the pretex t of \"spiritua lizing m atter, materialized the spirit in the m ost revolting ways.... Rebels to the hierar chic order , ... the y wished to substitu te the mystical licenc e of sensual passions to wise Christi an sobriet y and obedience to laws.... Ene mies of the family, they wished to produce sterili ty by increasing debau chery.\" 118 By way of systematically perverting the doctr ines of the Christian faith the Gno stics claimed to posses s the true versions of the Gospels, and profes sed belief in these to the exclusion of al l the others. 119 Thus the Ebionit es had the ir own corrupted version of the Gospel of St. Matth ew founded on the \"Gospel of the Hebrews,\" kno wn ear lier to the Jewish Christians; the Marcosians had their version of St. Luke, the Cain ites the ir own \"Gospel of Judas,\" and the Valentinians their \"Gospel of St. John.\" As we s hall see later,"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"the Gospel of St. John is the one tha t throughout the war on Christ ianity has been speci ally chosen for the purpose of perversion. Of course this spiri t of perversion was nothing new; m any centuri es earli er the prophet Isaiah had denounced it in the words: \"W oe unto the m that call evil good, and good evi l; that put darknes s for l ight, and light for darknes s!\" But the role of the Gnostics was to reduc e perversion to a s ystem by bind ing m en together into sects working under the guise of enl ighten ment in order to obscure all recogniz ed ideas of mor ality and rel igion. It is this which constitu tes their import ance in the histor y of secret societies. Whether the Gnostics the mselv es can be described as a secret socie ty, or rath er as a ramification of secret socie ties, is open to question. M. Matt er, quot ing a nu mber of third- century writers, show s the possibility that they had mysteries and init iations; the Church Fathers definit ely asserted this to be the case. 120 According to Tertullian, the Valentinians continued, or ra ther perver ted, the mysteries of Eleusis, out of w hich they made a \"sanctu ary of prostitu tion.\" 121 The Valentinians are known to have divided their members in to three classes--the Pneu matics, th e Psychics, and the Hylics (i.e. materialists); the Basilide ans are also said to have pos sessed secre t doctrin es known to hardl y one in a thousand of the sect. From all this M. Matt er conclud es that : 1. The Gnostics profes sed to hold b y means of tradit ion a secret doctr ine superior to that contained in the public writings of the apostles. 2. That they did not co mmunicate this doctrin e to everyone.... 3. That they communicated it by means of e mblems and symbols, as the Diagra m of the Ophites proves. 4. That in th ese co mmunications the y imitated the ri tes and tri als of the mysteries of Eleusis. 122 This claim to the possession of a secre t oral tradi tion, whether known under the na me of γν ῶ σις or of Cabala, confir ms the concep tion of the Gnostics as Cabalists and sho ws how far the y had depart ed fro m Christ ian te aching. For if onl y in this idea of \"one doctr ine for th e ignorant and anoth er for the initiated,\" the Gnostics had restored the very system which Christian ity had come to destro y. 123 M ANICHEISM Whilst we have seen the Gnostic sects working for mo re or less subversive purposes under the guise of esoter ic doc trines, we find in the Manich eans of Persia, who followed a centur y later, a sect e mbodying the same tendenci es and approach ing stil l nearer to secre t societ y organiza tion."},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"Cubricus or Corbicius, the founder of Maniche ism, was born in Bab ylonia about the y ear A.D. 216. Whilst stil l a child he is said to have been bought as a slave b y a rich widow of Ctesiphon, who libera ted hi m and on her dea th lef t him great wealth. According to anoth er stor y--for the whole histor y of Manes rests on legends- -he inheri ted fro m a rich old woman the books of a Sarac en na med Scythianus on the wisdom of the Egyptians. Combin ing the doctrin es these books conta ined with ideas borrowed fro m Zoroastr ianism, Gnosticism, and Christiani ty, and also with cer tain additions of his o wn, he elaborat ed a phi losophic s ystem which he proceed ed to t each. Cubricus then chang ed his na me to Mani or Manes and proclai med hims elf th e Paracl ete prom ised b y Jesus Christ. His followers were divided into two cl asses--the outer circle of hearers or combatants, and the inner circ le of teachers or ascetics described as the Elec t. As evidence of their resemblanc e with Free masons, it has been said that the Manich eans made use of secret signs, grips, and passwords, that owing to the c ircumstan ces of their master's adop tion the y called Manes \"the son of th e widow\" and the mselves \"the children of the widow ,\" but this is not clear ly proved. One of the ir custo ms is, however , interest ing in this connexion. According to legend, Manes undertook to cure the son of the King of Persia who had fa llen ill, but the prince died, whereupon Manes was fla yed alive by order of the king and his corpse hanged up at the ci ty gate. Ever y year after this, on Good Frida y, the Manich eans carri ed out a mourning cer emony known as the Bem a around the catafalqu e of Manes, who se real suf ferings the y were wont to contr ast with th e unreal sufferings of Christ. The fundam ental doctrine of Manicheis m is Dualism--that is to say, the exist ence of two opposing princ iples in the world, l ight and darknes s, good and evil- -founded, however , not on the Christi an concep tion of this idea, but on the Zoroastrian concept ion of Orm uzd and Ahrim an, and s o perver ted and mi ngled with Caba listic superstit ions that it met with as vehe ment denuncia tion b y Persian priests as b y Christian Fathers. Thus, according to the doctrin e of Manes, all matter is absolut e evil, the principl e of evi l is etern al, hu manity itself is of Satan ic orig in, and the first hu man beings, Adam and Eve, are represent ed as the offspring of devils. 124 Much the sa me idea may be found in the Jewish Cabal a, where it is said tha t Adam, after other abo minable pract ices, cohab ited with fe male dev ils whilst Eve consoled herself with m ale devi ls, so that whole races of de mons were born into the world. Eve is also accused of cohabit ing with the Serpent. 125 In the Yalkut Shim oni it is also related that during the 130 y ears that Adam lived apar t from Eve, \"he bega t a gener ation of devils, spirits, and hobgoblins.\" 126 Manichean demonolog y thus paved the way for the placa tion of the powers of darkness practised by the Euch ites at the end of the fourth centur y and later by the Paul icians, the Bogo mils, and the Lucifer ians. So it is in Gno sticism and Manicheis m that we find eviden ce of th e first at tempts to perver t Christi anity. The ver y fact that all such have been conde mned by the Church as \"heresi es\" has tended to enlist sympathy in their favour , yet even El iphas Lévi recogniz es that here the ac tion of th e Church was right, for the \" monstrous gnosis of Manes\" wa s a desecra tion not onl y of Christi an doctr ines but of pre- Christian sacred tradi tions."},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"2.

This man, Abdull ah ibn Ma ymūn, the son of a le arned and free-think ing doctor in Southern Persia, brought up in the doctr ines of Gno stic Dualis m and profoundl y versed in all religions, was in real ity, like his father , a pure m aterialist. By profe ssing adher ence to the creed of orthodox Shi-is m, and proclai ming a knowledg e of the mystic doctrines which the Ism ailis beli eved to have descended through Ism ail to his s on Moham med, Abdullah succeeded in plac ing hi mself at the head of the Is mailis. His advocac y of Ism ail was thus m erely a ma sk, his real aim being m aterialism, which he now proceeded to m ake into a system by founding a sect known as the Batinis with seven degre es of init iation. Dozy has given the following description of this a mazing project: To link together into one bod y the vanqu ished and the conquerors; to unite in the for m of a vast secret society with many degre es of init iation free-th inkers--who regarded re ligion only as a curb for the people--and bigots of all sects; to make tools of beli evers in order to give power to scepti cs; to induce conquerors to overturn th e empires the y had founded; to build up a part y, num erous, co mpact, and discipl ined, which in due ti me would giv e the throne, if not to hi mself, at least to his de scend ants, such was Abdullah ibn Ma ymūn's gener al aim--an extraordinar y concep tion which he worked out with m arvellous tact, incomparab le skill, and a profound knowledge of the hum an heart. The m eans which he adopt ed were devised with diabo lical cunning.... It was ... not among the Shi-ites tha t he sought his true supporters, but a mong the Ghebers, the Manicheans, the pagans of Harran, and the students of Greek philosoph y; on the last a lone could he rel y, to the m alone could he graduall y unfold the final mystery, and reveal that Imams, religions, and m orality were nothing but an i mpostur e and an absurdit y. The rest of ma nkind- -the \"asses,\" as Abdullah called them--were incap able of understand ing such doctrin es. But to gain his end he by no me ans disdained their aid; on the contrar y, he solic ited it, but he took care to ini tiate devou t and lowl y souls onl y in the first grades of the sect. His mission aries, who were incu lcated with the idea that their first duty was to conceal their true senti ments and adapt themselv es to the views of their auditors, appeared in m any guises, and spoke, as it were, in a dif feren t langu age to each class.

We shall now see how the s ystem of th e philosopher Abdullah paved the way for bloodshed b y the most terrib le sect the world had ever seen. T HE K ARMA THIT ES The first open ac ts of violen ce result ing fro m the doctr ines of Abdullah were carri ed out by the Karm athites, a new deve lopment of the Ismailis. Amongst the many Dais sent out by the leader --which included his son Ahmed and Ahmed's s on--was the Dai Hosein Ahwazi, Abdullah's envo y to Irak in Persia, who init iated a cer tain Hamd an surnam ed Karmath into the secre ts of the sect. Karm ath, who was a born intr iguer and believ ed in nothing, beca me the leader of the Karmathites in Arabia, where a numb er of Arabs were soon enlist ed in th e societ y. With extraord inary skill he succeed ed in persuading these dupes to make over all their m oney to hi m, first b y means of sm all contribu tions, lat er by larger sums, until at last he convinc ed the m of the advantages of abolishing all priv ate propert y and establ ishing the system of the community of goods and wives. This princ iple was enforc ed by the passage of the Koran: \"Rem ember the grace of God in tha t whilst you were ene mies, He has united your hearts, so that by His grac e you have become brothers....\" De Sac y thus trans-scribes the methods e mployed as given by the histori an Nowairi: When Karm ath had s ucceeded in establ ishing al l this, and everyone had agreed to confor m to it, he ordered the Dais to asse mble all the women on a cer tain night so that they should m ingle pro miscuousl y with all the men. This, he said, was perfe ction and the last degree of friendship and fra ternal union. Often a husband led his wife and presented her hims elf to one of his brothers when tha t gave him pleasure. When he (Karmath) saw that he had beco me absolute master of th eir m inds, had assured him self of their obedi ence, and found out the degree of their in telligenc e and discern ment, he began to lead the m quite astra y. He put before the m arguments borrowed from the doctrines of the Dualists. They fell in easil y with al l that he proposed, and then he took away from them all religion and released them from all those duti es of piet y, devotion, and the fear of God that he prescrib ed for the m in th e beginning. He perm itted them pillag e, and ever y sort of immoral licence, and taught them to throw of f the y oke of pra yer, fasting, and other precepts. He taught them that they were he ld by no obliga tions, and that th ey could pillage the goods and shed the blood of the ir adversari es with i mpun ity, that th e knowledge of the m aster of truth to whom he had called the m took the place of everything else, and tha t with th is kno wledge the y need no longer fear sin or punish ment."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"As the result of these te achings the Karm athites rapid ly became a band of brigands, pillaging and m assacring all those who oppo sed them and s pread ing terror throughout all the surrounding distric ts. Peaceful frat ernity was thus turn ed into a wild lust for conquest; th e Karm athites succeed ed in dom inating a grea t part of Arabia and the mou th of the Euphrates, and in A.D. 920 extended their ravages westwards. They took posse ssion of th e holy city of Mecca, in the defence of which 30,000 Mo slems fell. \"For a whole cen tury,\" says von Hammer, \"the pernic ious doctrines of K armath raged with fire and sw ord in the ver y bosom of Isla mism, unti l the widespread confl agration was extinguished in blood.\" But in procla iming themselv es revolut ionaries the Kar mathites had departed from the plan laid down by the origina tor of the ir creed, Abdullah ibn Ma ymūn, which had consisted not in ac ts of open viol ence but in a secret doctr ine which should lead to the gradua l under mining of al l religious fai th and a condition of me ntal anar chy rather than of material chaos. For viol ence, as alwa ys, had produced counter -violen ce, and it was thus tha t while the Kar mathites were rushing to the ir own destruct ion through a series of blood y conflic ts, another branch of the Ismailis were quiet ly reorganiz ing the ir forces more in confor mity with the orig inal method of their founde r. These were the Fati mites, so-cal led fro m their profes sed be lief that the doctr ine of the Prophet had descend ed fro m Ali, husband of Fati ma, Mohammed's daughte r. Whilst less extre me than the Karmathites, or than the ir predec essor Abdullah ibn Ma ymūn, the Fatimites, ac cording to the historian Makrizi, adopted th e method of instil ling doubts into the minds of bel ievers and aimed at the substitution of a natura l for a revealed relig ion.

T HE F ATIMITES The founder of the Fatimite dynasty of the Khalif as wa s one Ubeidallah, known as the Mahdi, accused of Jewish ancestr y by his adversaries the Abbasides, who declar ed-- appar ently without tru th--that he was the son or grandson of Ahmed, son of Adbullah ibn Maymūn, by a Jewess. Under the fourth Fatimite Khalifa Egypt fell into the power of the dynasty, and, before long, bi-weekl y assemblages of both men and wo men known as \"socie ties of wisdo m\" were institut ed in Ca iro. In 1004 these acquired a greater impor tance by the establish ment of the Dar ul Hik mat, or the House of Knowledge, b y the sixth Khalif a Haki m, who was raised to a deit y after his death and is w orshipped to this day by the Druses. U nder the dire ction of the Dar ul Hikm at or Grand Lodge of Cairo, the Fat imites continu ed the plan of Abdullah ibn Maymūn's secre t societ y with the addition of two mor e degrees, making nin e in al l. Their method of enlist ing prosel ytes and system of init iation--which, as Claud io Jannet points out, \"are absolutel y those which Weishaupt, the founder of the Illumina ti , prescribed to the 'Insinuat ing Brothers'\" 129 --were transcr ibed b y the fourteen th-centur y historian Nowairi in a description that may be briefly summarized thus 130 :"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The proselytes were broad ly divided into two classes, the le arned and the ignoran t. The Dai was to agre e with the for mer, applaud ing his wisdom , and to impress the l atter with his own knowledge b y asking him perpl exing questions on the Koran. Thus in in itiating him into the first degree the Dai assum ed an air of profundit y and expla ined th at rel igious doctr ines were too abstruse for the ordinar y mind, but mus t be interpre ted by men who, like the Dais, had a specia l knowledge of this scienc e. The in itiate was bound to absolute secrec y concern ing the truths to be revealed to hi m and oblig ed to pa y in advance for these revela tions. In order to pique his curiosi ty, the Dai would suddenl y stop s hort in the middle of a discourse, and should the novice finall y decline to pay the requ ired sum , he was left in a stat e of bewild erment which inspired him with the desire to know mo re. In the second degree the in itiate was persuaded that a ll his for mer teachers were wrong and that he must plac e his confiden ce sole ly in those Imams endowed with authorit y from God; in the third he learn t that these Imams were those of the Ism ailis, seven in num ber ending with Moham med, son of I smail, in contrad istinc tion to the twelv e Imams of the Imamias who supported the claims of Ism ail's brother Musa; in the fourth he was told that the prophets preced ing the Imams descend ing fro m Ali were also seven in nu mber -- namely Adam , Noah, Abraha m, Moses, Jesu s, the first Moha mmed, and fin ally Moha mmed son of I smail. So far , then, nothing was said to the in itiate in contrad iction to the broad ten ets of orthodox Islamism. But with the fifth degre e the process of underm ining his relig ion began, he was no w told to reject tradi tion and to disregard th e precep ts of M ohammed; in the sixth he was taught that all relig ious ob servan ces--pra yer, fasting, et c.--were onl y emblematic, that in fac t all these th ings were devic es to keep the co mmon herd of m en in subordinat ion; in the seventh the doctrines of Dualis m, of a grea ter and a lesser deit y, were in troduced and the uni ty of God--fundam ental doctrine of Islamism--was destro yed; in the eigh th a grea t vagueness was expressed on the attribu tes of the first and grea test of these deities, and it was poin ted out that real prophe ts were those who concerned themselves with practi cal matters--polit ical insti tutions and good forms of governm ent; finally, in the ninth, the adept was shown that all re ligious te aching was allegori cal and that religious precep ts need onl y be observed in so far as it is necessar y to maintain order , but the m an who understands the truth may disregard all such doctrines. Abraha m, Moses, J esus, and the other prophets were therefore only teachers who had profited by the lesson s of phi losoph y. All belief in revea led religion was thus destro yed. It will be seen th en that in the last degre es the whole teach ing of the first five was reversed and therefore shown to be a fraud. Fraud in fact constitu ted th e system of the societ y; in the instruc tions to the Dais ever y artifi ce is describ ed for enlist ing prosel ytes by misrepr esentat ion: Jews were to be won by speaking ill of Christians, Christ ians b y speaking ill of Je ws and Mosle ms al ike, Sunnis b y referring with respec t to the orthodox Khalif as Abu Bakr and O mar and crit icizing Ali and his descendan ts. Above al l, care was to be taken not to put before prosel ytes doctrines that m ight revo lt the m, but to m ake them advanc e step b y step.

Hakim sixth Fatimite Khal ifa and founder of the Dar ul Hikm at--a monster of tyranny and crime whose reign can only be co mpar ed to that of Ca ligula or Nero--was no w raised to the place of a divin ity by one I smail Darazi, a Turk w ho in 1016 announc ed in a mosque in Cairo that the Khalif a should be m ade an object of w orship. Hakim, who \"believed that divine reason was incarnat e in him,\" four y ears la ter procl aimed himself a dei ty, and the cul t was finall y establ ished b y one of his viz iers, the Persian mystic Ha mza ibn Ali. Haki m's crue lties, however , had so outraged the peopl e of Egypt that a year later he was murd ered b y a band of m alconten ts, led, it is said, b y his sister , who aft erwards concea led his bod y--a circu mstance which gave his followers the opportuni ty to declare that the div inity had m erely vanished in order to test the faith of believers, but would reappear in time and punish apo states. This bel ief beca me the doctr ine of th e Dru ses of Leb anon, whom Darazi had won over to the worship of Hakim . It is unnecessar y to ent er into the det ails of this strange rel igion, which still persists to- day in the range of Lebanon ; suffice i t to sa y that, although the outco me of the Ismailis, the Druses do not appe ar to have e mbra ced the materialism of Abdullah ibn Maymūn, but to have grafted on a pri mitive form of Nature- worship and of Sabeism the avowed bel ief of the Ismailis in the dynasty of Ali and his successor s, and beyond this an abstruse, esoter ic cre ed concern ing the nature of the Supre me Deity.

The Druses are in the hab it of hold ing m eetings where, as in the Dar ul Hik mat, both men and women assemble and relig ious and polit ical questions are discus sed; the uniniti ated, however , are al lowed to exer cise no influ ence on decisions, which are reached by the inner circle, to which only the \"Wise\" are admitted. The rese mblance between th is organiz ation and tha t of Grand Orient Freemasonr y is cle arly appar ent. The Druses also have modes of recogni tion which are co mmon to Freemasonr y, and M.

T HE A SSASSINS It will be seen that the Druse s, dist inguishing th emselves from other Is maili sects b y their worship of Haki m, yet retaining genuine re ligious bel iefs, had not carried on the atheistical tradit ion of Abdull ah ibn Maymūn and of the Grand Lodge of Cairo. But this tradition was to find in 1090 an exponent in the Persian Hasan Saba, a nativ e of Khorasan, the son of Ali, a stric t Shiah, who, finding himself suspected of here tical ideas, ended by declar ing hi mself a Sunni. Hasan, brought up in this at mosphere of dupl icity, was therefore well fitted to pla y the Machi avellian rôle of an Is maili Dai. Von Hammer regards Hasan as a m ighty genius, one of a splendid triad, of w hich the two others were his schoolfellows the poet O mar Khayyám and Niza m ul Mulk, Grand Vizier under the Seljuk Sultan, Malik Shah. Hasan, having through the prot ection of Niza m ul Mulk secured titles and revenues and final ly risen to office at the Court of the Sult an, attempted to supplan t his benef actor and eventua lly retired in disgrace, vowing venge ance against the Sultan and vizi er. At this juncture he encounter ed several Ismailis, one of w hom, a Dai na med Mum in, fina lly conver ted him to the princ iples of his sect, and Hasan, dec laring himself now to be a convin ced adher ent of the Fatimite Khalifas, journed to Cairo, where he was receiv ed with honour b y the Dar ul Hik mat and also b y the Khalifa Mustansir , to whom he bec ame counsellor . But his intr igues once more involv ing hi m in disgrac e, he fled to Aleppo and la id the foundations of his new sect. After enlisting proselytes in Bagdad, Ispahan, Khusistan, and Da magh an, he succe eded in obtaining by strateg y the fortress of Alamut in Persia on the Caspian Sea, where he"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"completed the plans for his great secret socie ty which was to beco me for ever infa mous under the na me of the Hashishi yīn, or Assassins . Under the pretenc e of bel ief in the doctr ines of Isla m and also of adheren ce to the Ism aili line of succession fro m the Prophet, Hasan Saba now set out to pave his wa y to power , and in order to ach ieve this end adopt ed the same method as Abdull ah ibn Ma ymūn. But the terrib le efficienc y of Ha san's societ y consisted in the fac t that a system of ph ysical force was now or ganized in a manner undrea mt of by his predecessor . As von Ham mer has observed in an ad mirable passage: Opinions are powerless, s o long as the y only confuse the brain, without ar ming the hand. Scept icism and free- thinking, as long as the y occup ied onl y the m inds of the indol ent and philosophi cal, have caused the ruin of no throne, for which purpose rel igious and politi cal fanaticism are the strongest lev ers in the hands of nations. It is nothing to the a mbitious man what people believe, but it is ever ything to know ho w he m ay turn the m for the execution of his pro jects. 132 Thus, as in th e case of th e French Revolu tion, \"whose first m overs,\" von Ham mer also observes, \"were the tools or le aders of secret societies,\" it was not m ere theor y but the method of enl isting nu merous dupes and plac ing weapons in the ir hands that brought about the \"T error\" of the Assassins six centur ies before that of their spiritual descendants, the Jacobins of 1793. Taking as his ground work the organiza tion of th e Grand Lodge of Cairo, Hasan reduced the nine degre es to the ir origin al number of seven, but th ese now received a defin ite nomenclature, and included not onl y real initiates but ac tive agents. Descending downwards, the degrees of the Assassins w ere thus as follows: first, the Grand Master , known as the Shaikh-al- Jabal or \"Old Man of the Mounta in\"--owing to the fact that the Order alwa ys possessed itself of castles in mo untainous regions; second, the Dail Kebir or Grand Priors; third, the ful ly initiated Dais, rel igious nuncios and politi cal emissar ies; fourth, the Rafiqs or associa tes, in training for the higher degrees; fifth, the Fadais or \"devoted,\" who undertook to deliv er the secret blow on which their superiors had decided; sixth, the Lasiqus, or law brothers; and last ly the \"com mon people,\" who were to be si mply blind instru ments. If the equiva lents to the words \" Dai,\" \"Rafiqs,\" and \"Fadais\" given b y von Ha mmer and Dr . Bussell as \"Master Masons,\" \"Fellow Crafts,\" and \"Entered Apprentic es\" are ac cepted, an int eresting analog y with the degre es of Freemasonr y is provided. Designs against religion were, of course, not admitted by the Order; \"stric t unifor mity to Islam was demanded from all the lower rank of uninit iated, but the adept was taught to see through the dec eption of 'faith and works.'

In order to sti mulate the ener gy of the Fadais, who were requir ed to carr y out these crimes, the superiors of the Order had recourse to an ingen ious s ystem of delusion. Throughout the territor y occupied by the Assassins were exquisite gardens with fruit trees, bo wers of roses, and sparkling strea ms. Here were arranged luxur ious resting- places with Persian carpets and soft divans, around which hovered black- eyed \"houris\" bearing wine in gold and silver drinking- vessels, whilst soft music mingled with the murmuring water and the song of birds. The young man whom the Assassins desired to train for a car eer of cr ime was introdu ced to the Grand Master of the Order and intox icated with haschisch--hence the na me \"Hashishi yīn\" applied to the sect, fro m which the word a ssassin is derived. Under the brief spell of uncon sciousnes s induc ed by this seduct ive drug the prospectiv e Fadai was then carried into the garden, where on awaking he believed himself to be in Paradise. After enjoying all its del ights he was given a fresh dose of the opiate, and, once more unconscious, was transported back to the presence of the Grand Ma ster, who as sured him that he had never lef t his side but had m erely exper ienced a foretast e of the Paradise tha t awai ted hi m if he obeyed the orders of his chiefs. The neoph yte, thus spurred on b y the be lief that he wa s carr ying out the commands of the Prophe t, who w ould reward hi m with eterna l bliss, eag erly entered in to the schem es laid down for hi m and devoted his life to mu rder. Thus b y the lure of Paradise the Assassins enl isted instrum ents for th eir cri minal work and establ ished a system of organized m urder on a basis of rel igious fervour . \"'Nothing is true and all is allowed' wa s the ground of their secret doctrine, which, however , being impar ted but to few and conc ealed under the veil of the m ost austere re ligion ism and pie ty, restra ined th e mind under the yoke of blind obedienc e.\" 134 To the outside world all this rem ained a profound m ystery; fidelity to Isla m was procl aimed as the fundam ental doctr ine of th e sect, and when the envo y of Sultan Sajar was sent to col lect infor mation on the rel igious beliefs of the Order he wa s met with the assurance: \"We believ e in the unit y of G od, and consider that only as true wisdom which accords with His word and the commands of the prophet.\" Von Hammer, answering the possible con tention that, as in the case of the Templars and the Bavarian Illuminati, these methods of dec eption might be decl ared a calumny on the Order , poin ts out that in the case of the Assassins no pos sible doubt ex isted, for the ir secre t doctrin es were eventu ally reveal ed by the leaders th emselves, first b y Hasan II, the third successor of Ha san Saba, and lat er by Jalal-ud-din Hasan, who public ly anathematized the founders of the sect and ordered th e burning of the books that contained their designs against rel igion- -a proceeding which, however , appears to have been a strateg ical manoeuvr e for restoring confidenc e in the Order and enabl ing hi m to continue th e work of s ubversion and cri me. A veritab le Reign of Terror wa s thus estab lished throughou t the East; the Rafiqs and Fadais \"spread the mselves in troops over the whole of Asia and darkened th e face of the ear th\"; and \"in the annals of the Assassins is found the chronologi cal enum eration of ce lebrated m en of all nations who have fallen the victims of the Ismailis, to the joy of their murderers and the sorrow of the world.\" 135"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"Inevi tably this long and systematic indulg ence in blood-lust recoiled on the heads of the leaders, and the Assassins, like the Terrorists of France, ended b y turning on each other .

How cam e this s ystem to be transported to the West? By what channel did the ideas of these succeeding Eastern sects penetra te to the Christ ian world ? In order to answer this question we mus t turn to the histor y of the Crusades. 3. T HE T EMPLERS In the year 1118--nineteen years after the first crusade had ended with the defea t of the Mosle ms, the capture of Antioch and Jerusale m, and the instal ment of G odefroi de Bouil lon as king of the la tter city--a band of nine French gentilshommes , led b y Hugues de Payens and Godefroi de Saint- Omer, formed themselves into an Order for the prote ction of pilgri ms to the Holy Sepulchre. Baldwin II, who at th is mo ment succeeded to the throne of Jeru salem, presented the m with a hou se near the site of the Temple of Solomon- -hence th e name of Knights Templar under which the y were to beco me famous. In 1128 the Order was sanction ed by the Council of Troyes and by the Pope, and a rule was drawn up b y St. Bernard under which the Knights Templar were bound b y the vow s of povert y, chasti ty, and obedience. But although the Templars distinguished them selves by many deeds of valou r, the regul ation that they were to live solely on al ms led to donations so enor mous tha t,"},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"abandon ing the ir vow of povert y, they spread the mselves over Europe, and b y the end of the twelfth centur y had beco me a rich and powerful bod y. The motto that the Order had inscrib ed upon its banne r, \" Non nobis, Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam ,\" wa s likewise forgotten, for , their faith waxing cold, they gave themselves up to pride and ostent ation. Thus, as an eigh teenth-centur y masonic writer has expressed i t: The war, which for the greater num ber of warriors of good fai th proved th e source of wearin ess, of losses and m isfortun es, beca me for the m (the Templars) onl y the opportuni ty for boot y and aggrandiz ement, and if they distingu ished the mselves b y a few brilliant actions, their motive soon ceased to be a m atter of doubt when the y were seen to enrich the mselves even with the spoils of the confeder ates, to increase their credit by the extent of th e new pos sessions the y had acquired, to carr y arrogance to the point of rivalling crowned princes in pom p and grandeu r, to refuse their aid against the enem ies of the faith, as the histor y of Saladin testifi es, and final ly to ally themselves with that horribl e and sanguinar y prince named the Old Man of the Mounta in, Prince of the Assassins. 137 The truth of th e last accusation is, however , open to question. For a t ime, at an y rate, the Templars had been at war with the Assassins. When in 1152 the Assassins mu rdered Raymond, Com te de Tripoli, the Templars enter ed their territory and forced them to sign a treat y by which they were to pa y a yearly tribute of 12,000 gold piec es in expia tion of the crime. Som e years later the Old Man of the Mountain sent an am bassador to Amaur y, King of Jerusale m, to te ll him priva tely that if the Templars would for go the payment of this tribute he and his fol lowers w ould embrace the Christian fa ith. Amaury accepted, offering at the same time to co mpensa te the Templars, but some of the Knights assas sinated the a mbassador before he could return to his ma ster. When asked for repar ations the Grand Ma ster threw the blame on an evi l one-e yed Knight na med Gautier de Maisnil. 138 It is evident, therefore, that the rel ations between the Templars and the Assassins were at first far from amicable; neverthel ess, it appears probable th at later on an understanding was brought about between them . Both on this char ge and on that of treach ery towards the Christian armies, Dr. Bussell's i mpartial view of the question may be quoted: When in 1149 the E mperor Conrad III fai led before Dam ascus, the Templars were believed to have a secret under standing with the garrison of that c ity; ... in 1 154 the y were said to have sold, for 60,000 gold pieces, a prince of Eg ypt who had wished to become a Christian; he was taken hom e to suf fer cer tain death a t the hands of his fanatical family. In 1166 Amaur y, King of Jerusale m, hanged twelv e members of the Order for betr aying a fortress to Nureddin. And Dr . Bus sell goes on to say that it cannot be disputed that they had \"long and impor tant dealings\" with the Assassins \"and were therefor e suspected (not unfairl y) of imbibing their precepts and following the ir princ iples.\" 139"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"By the end of the thirte enth centur y the Templars had beco me suspect, not onl y in the eyes of th e cler gy, but of the general public. \"Amongst the co mmon peopl e,\" one of the ir latest apo logists ad mits, \"vague ru mours c ircula ted.

Drinking habits were attribu ted to them; the saying was alre ady in use 'to drink like a Templar.' The old German word Tempelhaus indicated a house of il l-fame.\" 140 The same rumours had reached Clem ent V even before his ac cession to the papal throne in 1305, 141 and in this sa me year he su mmoned the Grand Master of the Order , Jacques du Mola y, to return to France fro m the island of C yprus, where he was as sembling fresh forces to avenge the recen t reverses of the Christian armies. Du Mola y arriv ed in France with sixt y other Knights Templar and 150,000 gold florins, as well as a lar ge quantit y of silver th at the Order had a massed in the E ast. 142 The Pope no w set himself to m ake enquiries concerning the char ges of \"un speakab le apostas y against God, detest able idolatr y, execr able vice, and many heresi es\" that had been \"secretly intimated\" to hi m. But, to quote his own word s: Because it did not see m likely nor credib le that men of such relig ion who were beli eved often to shed the ir blood and frequentl y expose their person s to the peri l of dea th for Christ's na me, and who s howed such grea t and m any signs of devotion both in divin e offices as w ell as in fasts, as in other devot ional observan ces, should be so for getful of their salva tion as to do these things, we were unwilling ... to give ear to this kind of insinua tion ... ( hujusmodi insinuacion i ac dela cioni ipsorum ... aur em noluimus inclinare ). 143 The King of France, Phil ippe le Bel, who had hi therto been the friend of the Templars, now beca me alarmed and ur ged the Pope to take action against them; but before the Pope was able to find out more about the m atter, the King took the law into his o wn hands and had all th e Templars in France arrest ed on October 13, 1307. The following charges were then brought aga inst the m by the Inquisitor for France before whom they were exa mined: 1. The ceremony of init iation into their Order was acco mpanied by insults to the Cross, the deni al of Christ, and gros s obsceni ties. 2. The adoration of an idol which was said to be the image of the true God. 3. The omission of the words of consecra tion at Mass. 4. The right th at the lay chiefs arrogat ed to th emselves of giving absolut ion. 5. The authoriz ation of unnatura l vice. To all these infam ies a great num ber of the Knights, includ ing Jacques du Mola y, confessed in almost precisel y the sa me terms; at the ir admission into th e Order , they said, they had been shown the cross on which was the figure of Christ, and had been asked whether they believed in Hi m; when they answered y es, they were told in som e cases tha t this was wrong ( dixit sibi quod male credebat ), 144 because He wa s not God, He was a"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"false prophet ( quia falsus p ropheta erat, nec erat Deus ). 145 Som e added that they were then shown an ido l or a beard ed head which they were told to worship 146 ; one added that this was of such \"a terr ible aspect that it see med to hi m to be the face of som e devi l, called in French un maufé , and that whenever he saw it he was s o overco me with fear tha t he could hardl y look at it without fear and trembling.\" 147 All who confessed dec lared that they had been ordered to spit on the cruc ifix, and ver y many that they had rec eived the injunction to co mmit obscenit ies and to practise unnatural vice. Some said tha t on the ir refusal to carr y out these orders the y had been threat ened with imprison ment, even perpe tual imprison ment; a few said the y had actua lly been incar cerated 148 ; one dec lared that he had been terror ized, seized b y the throat, and threa tened with death. 149 Since, however , a nu mber of these confes sions were made under torture, it is m ore impor tant to consider the evid ence provided b y the trial of the Knights at the hands of the Pope, where th is me thod was not employed. Now, at the time the Templars were arrest ed, Cle ment V., deepl y resenting the King' s interferenc e with an O rder which existed entire ly under papal jurisdict ion, wrote in the strongest term s of re monstran ce to Philippe le Bel urging the ir rele ase, and even after their trial, ne ither the confessions of the Knights nor the angr y expostu lations of the King could persuade hi m to bel ieve in their guilt. 150 But as the scandal concerning the Templars was increasing, he consented to rec eive in privat e audien ce \"a certa in Knight of th e Order , of grea t nobil ity and held b y the said Order in no sligh t estee m,\" who testif ied to the abom inations tha t took place on the rec eption of the Brethr en, the spitting on the cross, and other things which were not lawful nor , hum anly speaking, decen t. 151 The Pope then dec ided to hold an exa mination of sevent y-two French Knights at Poicti ers in order to discover whether the confessions ma de by them before the Inquisi tor at Paris could be sub stantiated, and at th is exa mination, conducted without torture or pressure of any kind in the presence of th e Pope hi mself, the witnes ses dec lared on oath tha t they would te ll \"the full and pure truth.\" They then made confessions w hich were co mmitted to writing in their presence, and th ese being afterwards read a loud to the m, they expressl y and willingl y approved the m ( perseverantes in illis eas expr esse et sponte, pr out recitate fuerunt approbarunt ). 152 Besides th is, an exa mination of the Grand Master, Jacques du Mola y, and the Precep tors of the Order wa s held in the presence of \"three Cardin als and four publ ic notar ies and many other good m en.\" These witnesses, sa ys the of ficial report, \"having sworn with th eir hands on the Gospel of G od\" ( ad sancta dei evange lia ab iis corpo raliter tac ta ) that-- they would on all the aforesa id things speak the pure and full tru th, the y, separate ly, freely, and spontan eousl y, without any coerc ion and fea r, deposed and confes sed among other things, the denial of Christ and spitting upon the cross w hen they were rec eived into the Order of the Temple.

The first sitt ing took pla ce in November 1309, when the Grand Master and 231 K nights were s ummoned before the pont ifical commissioners. \"This enquir y,\" says Michele t, \"was conducted slowl y, with m uch considera tion and gentleness ( avec beaucoup de ménagement et de douceur ) by high ecclesi astical digni taries, an archbishop, severa l bishops, etc.\" 154 But although a num ber of the Knights, including the Grand Master , now retra cted their admissions, som e damning confessions were aga in forthco ming. It is im possible within the scope of this book to follow the many trials of the Templars that took place in dif ferent countri es--in Ita ly, at Ravenna, Pisa, Bologna, and Florenc e, where tor ture was not e mployed and blasphe mies were ad mitted, 155 or in Germ any, where tortur e was em ployed but no confessions were m ade and a verdict was given in favour of the Order . A few detai ls concerning the tr ial in England may, howeve r, be of int erest. It has generall y been he ld that torture was not applied in Engl and owing to the hu manity of Edward II, w ho at first absolute ly refused to listen to an y accusations aga inst the Order . 156 On Dece mber 10, 1307, he had writ ten to the Pope in these ter ms: And because the said Master or Brethren constan t in the purit y of the Ca tholic faith have been frequentl y commended b y us, and b y all our kingdo m, both in their l ife and morals, we are unable to beli eve in suspicious stories of this kind unt il we know with grea ter certainty about these things.

But two y ears later, after Cle ment V had hi mself heard the confessions of the Order , and a Papal Bul l had been issued declar ing tha t \"the unspeak able wickednesses and abom inable cri mes of notorious heres y\" had now \"com e to the knowledge of al most everyone,\" Edward II was persuaded to arrest the Templars and order their exam ination. According to Mr .

In France more rigorous m easur es were adopted and fift y-four K nights who had retrac ted their confessions were burnt at the stake as \"relapsed heret ics\" on Ma y 12, 1310. Four years later, on March 14, 1314, the Grand Master , Jacques du Mola y, suffered the same fate. Now, however much we must execra te the barbari ty of this senten ce--as also the crue lties that had prec eded i t--- this is no reason why we should ad mit the claim of the Order to noble martyrdom put forward b y the historians who have espou sed their cause. The character of the Templars is not rehab ilitated by conde mning the conduct of the King and Pope. Yet this is th e line of ar gument usuall y adopted b y the defenders of the Order . Thus the two ma in content ions on which the y base their defence are, first ly, that the confessions of the Knights were ma de under torture, therefore they must be regarded as null and void; and, secondl y, that the whole affair was a plot concert ed between the King and Pope in order to obt ain posses sion of the Templars' riches. Let us exa mine these contentions in turn. In the first pla ce, as we have seen, all confessions w ere not m ade under tortur e. No one, as far as I a m aware, disputes Michele t's assertion that the enquir y before th e Papal Commission in Paris, at which a nu mber of Knights adhered to the state ments the y had made to th e Pope, was conducted without pressure of an y kind. But further , the fac t that confessions are made under torture does not necessaril y inval idate them as evidenc e. Gu y Fawkes also confessed under tor ture, y et it is never suggested tha t the whole stor y of the Gunpowder Plot was a m yth. Torture, however m uch we ma y conde mn it, has frequentl y proved the onl y method for overco ming the int imidation exercised over the mind of a conspira tor; a man bound b y the terrib le obl igations of a confedera cy and fear ing the venge ance of his fellow-conspirators will not readil y yield to persuasion, but only to force. If, then, so me of the Templars were terrori zed b y tortur e, or even by the fear of tortur e, it must not be for gotten that t errorism was exerc ised b y both sides. Few will deny that the Knights were bound b y oaths of secrec y, so that on one hand the y were threatened with the vengeanc e of the Order if the y betra yed its secrets, and on the other faced with tor ture if they refused to confess. Thus the y found the mselves between the devil and th e deep sea. It was therefore not a case of a m ild and unof fending Order meeting with bruta l trea tment at the hands of author ity, but of the victi ms of a terrib le autocracy being del ivered into the hands of another autocrac y."},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Moreover , do the confessions of the Knights appear to be the outcom e of pure imagination such as m en under the influenc e of tortur e might devise? It is cert ainly difficult to beli eve th at the accoun ts of the cer emony of in itiation given in detai l by men in different countries, a ll close ly resembling ea ch other , yet related in dif feren t phraseolog y, could be pure invent ions. Had the vi ctims been driven to inven t they would surely have contrad icted each other , have cried out in their agon y that all kinds of wild and fantastic rites had taken place in order to satisf y the de mands of their inter locutors. But no, each appe ars to be describ ing the same ceremony more or less com pletely, with characteristic touches tha t indi cate the personality of the speaker , and in th e main all the stories tally. The further cont ention that the case against the Templars wa s manufactured by the King and Pope with a view to obtaining their wealth is entire ly disproved b y facts. The la test French historian of m ediæval France, whilst expressing disbeli ef in th e guil t of the Templars, charac terizes this count er-accusat ion as \"pueril e.\" \"Philipp e le Bel,\" writes M. Funck-Brent ano, \"has never been understood; from the beginning peop le have not been just to hi m. This y oung prince was one of th e great est kings and the noblest charact ers that have appeared in histor y.\" 162 Without carrying appre ciation so far , one mus t neverth eless accord to M. Funck- Brent ano's statement of fac ts the at tention it merits. Philippe has been bla med for debasing the coin of the realm; in rea lity he m erely ordered it to be m ixed with al loy as a necessary measure aft er the war with England, 163 precisely as own coinag e was debased in consequence of the recen t war. This was done qui te openl y and the coinage was restored at the earliest opportun ity. Intensel y national, his polic y of atta cking the Lombards, exil ing the Jews, and suppres sing the Templars, however regret table the methods b y which it was carr ied out, resulted in immense benefi ts to France ; M. Funck- Brent ano has graphic ally described the prosperit y of the whole countr y during th e earl y fourte enth cen tury--the increase of populat ion, flourishing agricul ture and industr y. \"In Provence and Languedo c one m eets swineherds who have vine yards; si mple cowherds who have town houses.\" 164 The attitude of Philippe le Bel towards the Templars mus t be viewed in this light- - ruthless suppression of an y body of peopl e who interf ered with the prosperit y of France. His act ion was not that of arbitr ary author ity; he \"proceeded,\" says M. Funck-Brent ano, \"by means of an appea l to th e people. In his nam e Nogare t (the Chancel lor) spoke to th e Parisians in the garden of the Palace (Octob er 13, 1307). Popular asse mblies were convoked all over France\"; 165 \"the Parlia ment of Tours, with hardl y a dissenti ent vote, declared the Templars w orthy of death. The Universit y of Paris gave the weight of the ir judgem ent as to the fullness and auth enticity of the confessions.\" 166 Even assum ing that these bodies were ac tuated by the sa me servili ty as tha t which has been attribu ted to the Pope, how are we to explain the fac t that the trial of the Order arou sed no oppo sition among the far from docil e peopl e of Paris? If the Templars had indeed, as the y profes sed, been leading noble and upright l ives, devoting themselves to the care of the poor , one might surel y expect their arrest to be followed b y popular risings. But there appears to have been no sign of this."},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"As to the Pope, we have already seen tha t from the outset he had sho wn hi mself extremely reluc tant to conde mn the Order, and no satisfactor y explan ation is given of his chang e of att itude except that he wished to ple ase the King. As far as his o wn int erests were conc erned, i t is obvious tha t he could have noth ing to gain by publishing to the world a scanda l that must inevit ably bring opprobrium on the Church. His la mentations to this effect in the fa mous Bull 167 clear ly show that he recogniz ed this danger and therefor e desired at all costs to clear the accused Knights, if evid ence could be obta ined in their favour . It was onl y when the Templars m ade damning admissions in his pre sence that he was obliged to abandon their defence. 168 Yet we are told tha t he did this out of base compliance with the wishes of Philippe le Bel. Philippe le Bell is thus represented as the arch- villain of the whole pie ce, through seven long years hounding down a bla meless Order --from whom up to the very moment of the ir arrest he had repe atedly received loans of mon ey--solel y with the object of appropria ting their weal th. Yet after all we find that the propert y of the Templars was not appropria ted by the King, but was given b y him to the Knights of St. John of Jeru salem! What was the fat e of the Templars' good s? Philippe le Bel decided that they should be handed over to the Hospitallers. Cle ment V states tha t the Orders given by the King on this subject were execut ed. Even the do main of the Temple in Paris ... up to the eve of the Revolu tion was the propert y of the Knights of St. John of Jeru salem. The royal treasury kept for itself certa in sums for the costs of the trial. These had been i mmense. 169 These facts in no w ay daun t the antagonists of Phil ippe, who we are now assured--again without any proof whatever --was overruled by the Pope in this m atter. But set ting al l morality aside, as a mere question of polic y, is it likel y that the King would have deprived himself of his m ost valuable financ ial supporters and gone to th e immense troubl e of bringing them to tri al withou t first assuring hi mself tha t he would benef it by the af fair? Would he, in other words, have kil led th e goose that laid the golden eggs without any guaran tee that the bod y of the goose would remain in his pos session? Again, if, as we are told, the Pope suppressed the Order so as to pl ease the King, w hy should he have thwart ed him over the whole purpose the King had in view? Might we not expec t indign ant remonstrances from Philippe at thus be ing baulked of the boot y he had toi led so long to gain? But, on the contrar y, we find hi m completely in agree ment with the Pope on this subject. In N ovember 1309 Cle ment V distinc tly stated tha t \"Philipp e the Illustrious, King of France,\" to whom the facts concern ing the Templars had been told, was \"not prompted by avarice since he desired to keep or appropriat e for hi mself no part of the propert y of the Templars, but lib erally and devot edly left th em to us and the Church to be administer ed,\" etc. 170 Thus the whole theor y concerning the object for w hich the Templars were suppres sed falls to the ground--a theor y which on exa mination is seen to be built up entire ly on the plan of imput ing m otives without any justification in facts.

Funck- Brent ano in th is pas sage: As the Templars had houses in all countries, they practised the financ ial operations of th e international banks of our ti mes; they were acquain ted with letters of change, order s payable at sight, the y institu ted div idends and annui ties on deposi ted cap ital, advanc ed funds, lent on credi t, control led private accounts, under took to raise taxes for the lay and ecclesiast ical seigneurs. 172 Through their profi cienc y in these matters--acquired very possibl y from the Jew s of Alexandr ia who m the y must have met in the East--the Templars had becom e the \"international financi ers\" and \"intern ational cap italists\" of the ir day; had the y not been suppressed, all the evi ls now denounced b y Socia lists as pecul iar to the s ystem they describ e as \"Capit alism\"--trusts, mo nopoli es, and \"corners\"--would in a ll probabi lity have been inaugurat ed during the course of the fourteen th centur y in a far worse for m than at the present da y, since no leg islation existed to prote ct the community at lar ge. The feuda l system, as Marx and Engels perce ived, was the principa l obstac le to exploit ation by a finan cial autocr acy. 173 Moreover , it is b y no m eans im probab le tha t this order of things would have been brought about by the vio lent overthrow of the French monarch y--indeed, of a ll monarchies; the Templars, \"those terr ible conspirators,\" sa ys Eliph as Lévi, \"threat ened the whole world with an immense revolut ion.\" 174 Here perhaps we ma y find th e reason wh y this band of dissolut e and rapa cious nobles has enlisted th e passionate sympathy of de mocratic writers. For it will be notic ed tha t these same writers who attribu te the King' s conde mnation of the Order to env y of the ir weal th never apply this argument to the demagogues of the eight eenth centur y and s uggest that their accusa tions aga inst the nobles of France were inspired b y cupid ity, nor w ould they ever admit that any such m otive m ay enter into th e diatr ibes aga inst privat e owners of wealth to-da y. The Templars thus rem ain the onl y body of capit alists, with the exc eption of the Jews, to be not onl y pardoned for their riches but exalt ed as noble victi ms of prejudice and env y. Is it merely because the Templars were the ene mies of mon archy? Or is it that the world revo lution, whilst att acking private owners of propert y, has never been opposed to Internat ional Finance, par ticularly when co mbined with anti- Christian tendencies? It is the cont inued defen ce of the Templars which, to the present writer , appears the most convin cing ev idence against them. For even if one bel ieves th em innoc ent of the cri mes laid to their char ge, how is it possible to ad mire them in the ir later stages? The fact that canno t be deni ed is tha t they were false to their obligat ions; tha t they took the vow of povert y and then grew not onl y rich but arrogan t; tha t they took the vow of chast ity and"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"became notoriousl y immoral. 175 Are all these things then condoned bec ause the Templars formed a link in the chain of w orld revolution? At this distance of time the guilt or innocence of the Templars will probabl y never be conclusivel y established either way; on the mass of conflic ting evidence bequeath ed to us by histor y no one can pronounce a fina l judgement. Without attempting to dig matize on the question, I would suggest tha t the real truth m ay be that th e Knights were both innocent and guilt y, that is to sa y, that a certa in nu mber were in itiated into the secret doctrine of the Order whilst the m ajorit y remained throughout in ignoran ce. Thus accord ing to the eviden ce of Steph en de Stape lbrugge, an English Knight, \"ther e were two m odes of reception, one lawful and good and the other contr ary to th e Faith.\" 176 This would ac count for th e fact that some of the accused declined to confess even under the grea test pressure. These m ay really have known nothing of the real doctr ines of the Order, which were confid ed oral ly only to those whom the superiors regarded as unlikely to be revol ted by them. Such have alwa ys been the methods of secre t socie ties, fro m the Ism ailis onward. This theor y of a double doctrin e is put forward b y Loiseleur , who observes: If we consult the statu tes of the Order of the Temple as the y have co me down to us, we shall certa inly discover there is nothing that justifies the strange and abom inable practi ces revealed at the Inquir y. But ... besides the publ ic rule, had not th e Order another one, whether tradi tional or written, authori zing or even prescribing these prac tices- -a secret rule, reveal ed onl y to the in itiates? 177 Eliphas Lév i also exoner ates the majorit y of the Templars from complicity in either anti- monarchica l or ant i-religious designs: These tendenc ies were enve loped in profound m ystery and th e Order m ade an outward profession of the most perfec t orthodox y. The Chiefs alon e knew whither they were going; the rest followed unsuspecting ly. 178 What, then, was the Templar heres y? On this point we find a varie ty of opinions. According to Wilcke, Ranke, and Weber it was \"the unitar ian de ism of Isla m\" 179 ; Lecouteu lx de Cant eleu thinks, however , it was derived fro m hereti cal Islamic sources, and relates that whilst in Palest ine, one of the Knights, Guill aume de Montbard, was initiated by the Old Man of the Mounta in in a cave of Mount L ebanon. 180 That a certa in resemblance existed between th e Templars and the Assassins has been indica ted by von Hammer, 181 and further emphasized by the Freemason Clave l: Orient al histor ians sho w us, at different periods, the Order of the Templars m aintaining intimate relations with that of the Assassins, and they insist on the af finity that exist ed betwe en the two as sociations.

The Templars, as far as can be discovered, were anti- Christian deists; Lo iseleur considers that their ideas were der ived fro m Gnostic or Manichean dualists--Ca thari, Paulici ans, or mo re particularly Bogo mils, of which a brief accoun t must be given here. The Paulicians , who flourished about the seventh cen tury A.D., bore a rese mblance to the Cainites and Ophites in the ir det estation of the Demiurgus and in the corruption of their morals. Lat er, in the ninth centur y, the Bogomils , whose na me signifi es in Slavoni c \"friends of G od\" and who had m igrated from Northern S yria and Mesopota mia to th e Balkan Peninsula, particu larly Thrace, appeared as a further deve lopment of Maniche an dualism. Their doctrin e may be sum marized thus: God, the Supreme Father , has two s ons, the elder Satanael, the younger Jesus. To Satan ael, who sat on the right hand of God, belonged the right of governing th e celestial world, but, filled with pride, he rebel led aga inst his Father and fel l from Heaven. Then, aided by the companions of his fall, he creat ed the visible world, image of the ce lestia l, having like the other its sun, mo on, and stars, and last he created man and the serpent which beca me his m inister. Later Christ ca me to ear th in order to show me n the way to Heaven, but His death was inef fectual, for even b y descend ing into Hell He could not wrest the power from Satana el, i.e. Satan. This belief in the impoten ce of Christ and the necessit y therefore for pla cating Satan, not only \"the Prince of this world,\" but i ts creato r, led to the further doctr ine tha t Satan, being all-powerful, should be adored. Nice tas Choniat es, a B yzantine histor ian of the twelfth century, describ ed the followers of this cul t as \"Satanists,\" because \"consider ing Satan powerful they worshipp ed him lest he might do them harm\"; subsequentl y they were known as Lucif erians, the ir doctr ine (as stat ed by Neus s and Vitoduranus) being tha t Lucifer was unj ustly driven out of Heaven, tha t one da y he will ascend there again and be restored to his for mer glory and power in the cel estial world. The Bogom ils and Lucifer ians were thus close ly akin, but whilst the form er divided th eir worship between God and His two sons, the la tter worshipped Lucifer only, regard ing the material world as his work and holding that by indulging the flesh they were propi tiating their De mon-Crea tor. It was said that a black cat, the s ymbol of Satan, figured in the ir ceremonies as an ob ject of wor ship, also that at their horrib le nocturn al orgies sacrifices of chi ldren were made and their blood used for ma king the Euch aristic bread of the sect. 183"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"Thus the Templars recogn ize at the same time a good god, inco mmunicab le to man and consequen tly withou t symbolic representa tion, and a bad god, to whom they give the features of an idol of fearful aspect. 184 Their most ferven t worship was addres sed to this god of evi l, who alone could enri ch them. \"The y said with the Lucif erians: 'The elder son of God, Satana el or Luc ifer alone has a righ t to th e homage of mo rtals; Jesu s his y ounger brother does not deserve this honour .'\" 185 Although we s hall not find these ide as so clearly defined in the confes sions of th e Knights, som e colour is len t to th is theor y by those who rel ated that the reason given to them for not believ ing in Christ was \"tha t He was nothing, He was a false prophet and of no valu e, and tha t they should beli eve in the Higher God of Heaven who could save them.\" 186 According to Loisel eur, the idol they were taugh t to worship, the bearded head known to histor y as Baphom et, represented \"the infer ior god, or ganiz er and do minator of the material world, author of good and evil here below , him by whom evil was introduced into creation.\" 187 The etymology of the word Bapho met is dif ficult to discover ; Raynouard says it origin ated with two witnesses heard a t Carcassonne who spoke of \"Figura Baflo meti,\" and suggests tha t it was a corruption of \"Moha mmed,\" whom the Inquisitors wished to make the Knights confess the y were taugh t to adore. 188 But this sur mise with regard to the intentions of the Inquisitors see ms highl y improb able, since the y must have been well aware that, as Wilcke points out, the Mo slems forbid al l idols. 189 For this reason Wilcke concludes that the Mohammedanis m of the Templars was com bined with Cabal ism and that their idol was in reali ty the macroprosopos , or head of the Ancien t of Ancients, represen ted as an old man with a long beard, or sometimes as three heads in one, which has alr eady been referred to under the name of the Long Face in the first chap ter of this book--a theor y which would agre e with E liphas Lév i's assertion tha t the Templars were \"initiated in to the mysterious doctr ines of the Cabala.\" 190 But Lévi goes on to define this teaching under the name of Johannis m. It is here th at we rea ch a further theor y with regard to the secret doc trine of the Templars--- the m ost importan t of al l, since it emanates from masonic and neo-T emplar sources thus ef fectually disposing of the contention that the char ge brought aga inst the Order of apo stasy from the Catholi c faith is solely the inv ention of Catholi c writers. In 1842 the Freem ason Ragon relat ed that the Templars learn t from the \"ini tiates of the East\" a cert ain Judaic doctrin e which was attr ibuted to St. John the Apostle; therefore \"they renounced the rel igion of St. Peter\" and bec ame Johanni tes. 191 Eliph as Lévi expresses the same opinion. Now, these stat ements are apparen tly founded on a legend which was first published early in the nine teenth centur y, when an associat ion ca lling itself the Ordre du Temple and claiming direc t descen t from the origina l Templar Order published two w orks, the Manuel des Chevali ers de l 'Ordre du Temple in 1811, and th e Lévitikon in 1831, toge ther with a version of the Gospel of St. J ohn dif fering fro m the Vulgate.

The histor y of the Prim itive Church is then given as follows: Moses w as ini tiated in Egypt. Profoundl y versed in the ph ysical, theo logical, and metaphysical mysteries of the priests, he knew how to profit by these so as to surm ount the power of the Mages and de liver his com panions.

The legend of the Ordre du Temple goes on to say: Up to about the y ear 1118 (i.e. the y ear the Order of the Temple was founded) the mysteries and the hierar chic Order of the ini tiation of Eg ypt, trans mitted to the Jews by Moses, then to th e Christians by J.C., were re ligiousl y preserved b y the successors of St. John the Apostle.

Hugues wa s invest ed with the Apostolic Patriarcha l power and pla ced in the leg itimate order of the successor s of St. John the apostl e or the evangel ist. Such is the origin of the foundat ion of the Order of the Temple and of the fusion in this Order of the different kinds of init iation of the Christians of the East designa ted under the title of Prim itive Christians or Johannites. It will be seen at once that all this stor y is subtl y subversive of tru e Christian ity, and that the appel lation of Christians applied to the Johanni tes is an i mposture. Indeed Fabré Palapr at, Grand Master of the Ordre du Temple in 1804, who in his book on the Templars repeats the story contain ed in the Lévitikon and the Manuel des Cheva liers du T emple , whilst making the sa me profes sion of \"prim itive Christ ian\" doctr ines descending from St. John through Theoc let and Hugues de Pa yens to the Order over which he presides, goes on to say that th e secret doctrine of the Templars \"was es sentially contrar y to the canons of the Church of Ro me and that it is principa lly to this fact that one m ust at tribut e the persecu tion of which histor y has preserved the memory.\" 192 The belief of the Pri mitive Christi ans, and consequent ly that the Templars, with regard to the miracles of Christ is that He \"did or m ay have done extraordin ary or m iraculous th ings,\" and that since \"God can do things inco mprehensibl e to hu man inte lligence,\" the Pri mitive Church venera tes \"all the acts of Christ as the y are described in the Gospel, whether it considers them as acts of hum an scien ce or whether as acts of divin e power .\" 193 Belief in the div inity of Christ is thus left an open question, and the sa me attitude is ma intained towards the Resurrec tion, of which the stor y is omitted in the Gospel of St. J ohn posses sed by the Order . Fabré Palapra t further admits that th e gravest accusations brought against the Templars were founded on fac ts which he at tempts to expl ain awa y in the fol lowing manner: The Templars having in 1307 carefu lly abstracted all the m anuscripts co mposing the secre t archiv es of the Order fro m the search made by authorit y, and these authent ic manuscr ipts having been prec iously preserved since that period, we have to-da y the certainty that the Knights endured a grea t number of religious and mo ral trials before reaching the different degrees of in itiation: thus, for exa mple, the recip ient might receiv e the injunction under pain of dea th to tram ple on the crucifix or to wor ship an idol, but if he yielded to the terror which th ey sought to inspire in hi m he was declar ed unworth y of being admitted to the higher grades of the Order .

Eliphas Lév i, who, like Ragon, accep ts the state ments of the Ordre du Temple conc erning the \"Johannite\" origin of the Templars' secret doctrin e, is, however , not deceiv ed by these professions of Christian ity, and boldl y asserts tha t the Sovereign Pontif f Theocle t initiated Hugues de Pa yens \"into the m ysteries and hope s of his pre tended Church, he lured him by the ideas of sacerdotal sovereignt y and suprem e royalty, he indic ated him finally as his successor . So the Order of the Knights of th e Temple was stained fro m its origin with schis m and conspirac y against Kings.\" 194 Further , Lév i relates tha t the real story told to ini tiates concern ing Christ was no other than the infamous Toledot Yeshu describ ed in the first chap ter of th is book, and which the Johann ites dared to attribute to St. John. 195 This would accord with the confes sion of the Cat alonian Knight Templar, Galcerandus de Teus, w ho sta ted tha t the form of absolut ion in the Order wa s: \"I pra y God that He ma y pardon your sins as He pardoned St. Mar y Magdalene and the th ief on the cross\"; but the witness went on to expl ain: By the thief of w hich the head of the Chapter speaks, is m eant, according to our statut es, that Jesu s or Christ who was crucif ied by the Jew s bec ause he was not God, and y et he said he wa s God and the King of the Jews, w hich was an outrage to the true God w ho is in Heaven. When Jesus, a few mo ments before his death, had his side pi erced by the lance of Long inus, he repent ed of having called himself God and King of the Jews and he asked pardon of the true God; then th e true God pardoned him. It is thus that we appl y to the crucif ied Christ these word s: \"as G od pardoned the th ief on the cross.\" 196 Raynouard, who quot es this deposition, stigmatizes it as \"singular and extrav agant\" ; M. Matter agrees that i t is doubtl ess extr avagan t, but tha t \"it merits attention. There was a whole system there, which was not the inven tion of Galcerant.\" 197 Eliphas Lév i provides the clue to that system and to the reason why Christ was described as a thief, by indicating the Cabalist ic legend wherein He wa s describ ed as having stolen the sacred Name from the Holy of H olies. Elsewhere he expla ins that the Johannit es \"m ade themselves out to be the only peopl e initiated into the tru e mysteries of the re ligion of the Saviou r.

For the whole stor y of the initiation of the Templars b y the \"Johanni tes\" rests princip ally on the docu ments produced by the Ordre du Temple in 181 1. According to the Abbés Grégoire and Münter the au thenti city and antiquity of these docu ments are beyond dispute. Grégoir e, referring to the parch ment manuscr ipt of th e Lévitikon and Go spel of St. John, sa ys that \"Hell enists versed in paleograph y believe this m anuscrip t to be of the th irteen th cen tury, others declare it to be earlier and to go back to the eleven th centur y.\" 199 Matter , on the other hand, quoting Münter's opinion that th e manuscrip ts in the archives of the m odern Templars dat e from the thirteenth centur y, observes that th is is all a tissue of errors and tha t the critics,"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"including the learn ed Professor Thilo of Hall e, have recognized that the m anuscript in question, far fro m belonging to the thir teenth centur y, dates from the beginning of th e eighteenth. From the arrange ment of the chapt ers of the Gospel, M.

The antiqu ity of the manuscrip t conta ining the histor y of the Templars thus rem ains an open question on which no one can pronounce an opinion without having seen the origin al. In order , then, to judge of the probabi lity of the stor y that this manuscript contained it is nec essary to consult the fac ts of histor y and to discover what proof can be found tha t any such sect as the Johannit es existed at the time of the Crusades or earlie r. Certainly none is known to have been cal led by this nam e or by one resem bling it before 1622, when som e Portuguese monks reported the existen ce of a sect whom they describ ed as \"Christians of St. J ohn\" inhab iting the banks of the Euphrat es. The appellation appe ars, ho weve r, to have been wrongl y applied by the m onks, for the sectarians in question, variousl y known as the Mandæans, Mandaites, Sabians, Nazoreans, etc., ca lled themselves Mandaï I yahi, that is to sa y, the discipl es, or rather the wise m en, of John, th e word mandaï being deriv ed fro m the Chalde an word manda , corresponding to the Greek word γν ῶ σις or wi sdom. 201 The multiplicity of nam es given to the Mandæans arises apparen tly from the fact tha t in their dealings with other communities the y took the name of Sabi ans, w hilst the y called the wise and learned amongst themselves Nazoreans. 202 The sect form erly inhabit ed the banks of the Jordan, but was driven out b y the Moslems, who forced them to retir e to Mesopota mia and Babylonia, where they particular ly affected th e neighbourhood of rivers in order to be able to carr y out the ir pecu liar baptis mal rites. 203 There can be no doubt tha t the doctrines of th e Mandæans do resem ble the description of the Johannite heres y as given b y Eliphas Lév i, though not b y the Ordre du Temple , in tha t the Mandæans profes sed to be the disciples of St. J ohn--the Baptist, howeve r, not th e Apostle- -but were at the sa me time the enem ies of Je sus Christ. According to th e Mandæans' Book of John (Sidra d' Yahya), Yahya, that is to sa y, St. John, baptiz ed myriads of me n during forty years in the Jordan. B y a mistake--or in respon se to a writt en mandate from heaven saying, \"Y ahya, bapt ize the li ar in th e Jordan\"--he bapt ized the false prophet Yishu Meshiha (the Messiah Jesus), son of the devi l Ruha Kadishta. 204 The same idea is found in another book of the sect, called the \"Book of Adam,\" which represen ts Jesus as the perver ter of St. J ohn's doctrine and the disseminator of iniqui ty and perfid y throughout the world. 205 The rese mblance between a ll this and the legends of the Talmud, th e Cabal a, and the Toledot Yeshu is at once apparent ; moreov er, the Mandæans cla im for the \"Book of Adam\" the sa me origin as the Jew s claimed for the Caba la, na mely, that it was deliv ered to Adam by God through the hands of the ange l Razael. 206 This book, known to scholars as the Codex Nasaræus , is described by Münter as \"a sort of m osaic without order , withou t method, where one finds m entioned Noah, Abraha m, Moses, Solom on, th e Temple of Jeru salem, St. John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, the Christians, and Mohammed.\" M.

Whether i t was b y this sect that th e Templars were indoctrin ated must remain an open question. M. Matter objects that th e eviden ce lacking to such a conclusion lies in the fact that the Templars expressed no part icular reverenc e for St. John; but Loiseleur asserts that the Templars did prefer the Gospel of St. J ohn to that of the other evangel ists, and that modern masonic lodges cla iming descent fro m the Templars pos sess a specia l version of this Go spel said to have been copi ed fro m the origin al on Mount Athos. 210 It is also said that \"Baphom ets\" were preserved in th e masonic lodges of Hungar y, where a debased form of Masonr y, known as Johannit e Masonr y, survives to this day. If the Templar heres y was that of the Johanni tes, the head in quest ion m ight possibly represent that of John the Bap tist, which would accord with the theor y that the word Bapho met was deriv ed fro m Greek words signif ying baptis m of wi sdom. This would, moreover , not be incompatible with Loisel eur's theor y of an af finity between the Templars and the Bogo mils, for the Bogom ils also posses sed their own version of th e Gospel of St. John, which they placed on the heads of their neoph ytes during the cer emony of in itiation, 211 giving as the reason for the 'I pecul iar vener ation they professed for its au thor that they regard ed St. John as the servant of the Jewish God Satanae l. 212 Eliph as Lévi even goes so far as to accuse th e Templars of following the occult pract ices of the Lucif erians, who carried the doctrin es of the Bogo mils to the point of pa ying ho mage to the powers of darkness: Let us declar e for the edific ation of the vulg ar ... and for the greater glory of the Church which has persecu ted th e Templars, burned the m agicians and exco mmunicated the Free- Masons, etc., le t us sa y boldl y and loudl y, that all th e initiates of the occu lt sciences ... have adored, do and will alwa ys adore that which is signified by this frightfu l symbol [the Sabbat ic goa t]. 213 Yes, in our profound convict ion, the Grand Ma sters of the Order of the Templars adored Bapho met and caused hi m to be adored b y their initiates. 214 It will be seen, then, tha t the accusat ion of heres y brought against th e Templars does not emanate solel y from the Ca tholic Church, but also from the secret socie ties. Even our Freemasons, who, for reasons I shall show lat er, have general ly defended the Order , are now willing to ad mit that th ere was a ver y real case against th em. Thus Dr . Ranking, who has devot ed many years of stud y to the question, has arriv ed at the conc lusion that Johannis m is the real clue to the Templar heres y. In a ver y interesting paper publ ished in"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"the masonic journal Ars Quatuor Cor onatorum , he observes tha t \"the record of the Templars in Palest ine is one long tal e of intr igue and treach ery on the part of the Order,\" and finall y: That from the very commencement of Christian ity there has been transm itted through the centuries a body of doctrine incompatible with Christiani ty in th e various of ficial Churches.... That the bodies tea ching these doctrin es profes sed to do so on the author ity of St. John, to whom , as the y claimed, the true secrets had been committed by the Founder of Christi anity. That during th e Middle Ages the m ain support of the Gnostic bodies and th e main repositor y of this knowledge was the Societ y of the Templars. 215 What is the explana tion of th is choice of St. John for the propagat ion of ant i-Christi an doctr ines which we shall find cont inuing up to the present day? What else than the method of perversion which in its extre me form beco mes Satan ism, and consists in always selecting the m ost sacred things for the purpose of desecra tion? P recisely then because the Gospel of St. John is the one of all the four w hich most insists on the divini ty of Christ, the occu lt ant i-Christi an sects have habitu ally made it the basis of their rites. 4. T HREE C ENTU RIES OF O CCULTISM It has been sho wn in the foregoing chapters that from very early times occul t sects had existed for two purposes--esoteric and poli tical. Whilst the Manich eans, the early Ismailis, the Bogom ils, and the Luc iferians had concerned themselves m ainly with religious or esoter ic doctr ines, the later Ismailis, the Fat imites, the Karmathites, and Templars had co mbined secre cy and occu lt rites with the polit ical aim of do mination. We shall find this double trad ition running through al l the secret society movement up to the present day. The Dualist doctr ines at tribut ed to the Templars were not, however , confin ed to th is Order in Europe, but had been, as we have seen, those professed b y the Bogo mils and also by the Cathar i, who spread westwards from Bulgari a and Bosnia to France. It was owing to their sojourn in Bulgari a that the Cathari gained the popular nickna me of \"Bulgars\" or \"Bou rgres,\" signif ying those addi cted to unnatura l vice. One section of the Cathari in the South of France beca me known after 1180 as the Albigenses, thus ca lled from the town of Albi, although their headquart ers were real ly in Toulouse. Christ ians only in na me, they adher ed in secre t to the Gno stic and Manichean doctrines of th e earl ier Cathari, which they would appe ar to have combined with Johannis m, since, lik e this Eastern sect, they claimed to posses s their own G ospel of St. J ohn. 216"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Although not strict ly a secre t socie ty, the Albigenses were divided af ter the secret society system into ini tiates and se mi-initiates.

It was amongst the nobles of Languedoc that the Albigenses found their principa l support. This \"Judæa of France,\" as it has been called, was peopled by a medley of m ixed races, Iberian, Gall ic, Ro man, and Se mitic. 218 The nobles, ver y differen t from the \"ignorant and pious chiv alry of th e North,\" had lost all respect for the ir trad itions. \"Ther e were few who in going back did not encount er som e Sarac en or Jewish grandm other in the ir genealogy.\" 219 Moreover , many had brought back to Europe the laxity of m orals they had contr acted during the Crusades. The Co mte de Co mminges pract ised pol ygamy, and, according to ecclesiastic al chron icles, Raymond VI, Com te de Toulouse, one of the most arden t of the Albigense Credentes , had his hare m. 220 The Albigensian movement has been falsely represent ed as a protest merely against the t yranny of the Church of Rom e; in reality it was a rising against th e funda mental doctrines of Christiani ty--more than th is, against al l princip les of rel igion and morality. For whilst some of the sect openl y declared that the Jewish law was preferab le to that of the Christ ians, 221 to others the God of the Old Testament was as abhorrent as the \"false Christ\" who su ffered at Golgoth a; the old hatr ed of the Gnostics and Maniche ans for the de miurgus lived again in these rebe ls against the socia l order . Forerunners of the sevent eenth- centur y Libertines and eigh teenth- centur y Illuminati, the Albigense nobles, under the pretex t of fight ing the priesthood, strove to throw of f all the restraints th e Church i mposed. Inevi tably the disorders tha t took place throughout the South of France l ed to reprisa ls, and the Albigenses were suppre ssed with all the crue lty of the age--a fact which has afforded historians the opportunit y to exal t them as noble martyrs, vic tims of ecclesiast ical despotis m.

It is, ho wever , idle to den y that the cult of evil has alwa ys existed ; the invocat ion of the powers of darkness wa s prac tised in the ear liest days of the hu man race and, after the Christi an era, found its expression, as we have seen, in the Cainit es, the Euch ites, and the Luciferians. These are not surmises, but actu al fac ts of histor y. Towards the end of the twelf th cen tury Lucif erianism spread eastwards through Styria, the Tyrol, and Bohe mia, even as far as Brandenbur g; by the beginn ing of the thirte enth cen tury it had invad ed western Ger many, and in the fourte enth cen tury reached its zenith in tha t countr y, as also in Italy and France. The cult had no w rea ched a further stage in its deve lopment, and i t was not the mere propitia tion of Satanael as the prin ce of this world practised by the Luciferians, but actu al Sat anism --the love of evil for th e sake of evi l--which for med the doctr ine of th e sect known in Italy as la vecchia religione or the \"old religion.\" Sorcer y was adopted as a profes sion, and witches, not, as is popularl y supposed, sporadic growths, were tra ined in schools of ma gic to pract ise the ir art. These facts should be remembered when the Church is bla med for the vio lence it displa yed aga inst witch craft- - it was not individu als, but a system which it set out to destro y. The essence of Satan ism is desecra tion. In the ceremonies for infern al evoc ation describ ed by Eliphas Lévi we read: \"It is requisit e to profane the ceremoni es of the religion one belongs to and to tra mple its holiest symbols under foot.\" 223 This pract ice found a climax in desecr ating the Hol y Sacra ment. The consecra ted wafer was given as food to mice, toads, and pigs, or deni ed in unspeakab le wa ys. A revolting description of the Black Mass may be found in Hu ysmans's book Là-bas . It is unnecessar y to transcribe the loathso me details here. Suffice it, then, to show that this cul t had a very real existence, and if an y furth er doubt re mains on the matter, the life of Gilles de Rais supplies docum entar y eviden ce of the visible results of black magic in the Middle Ages. Gilles de Rais was born at Machecoul in Britt any about the y ear 1404. The first per iod of his lif e was glorious; th e compan ion and guid e of Jeanne d'Arc, he bec ame Maréchal of France and distingu ished hi mself by many deeds of valour . But after dissipating his immense fortun e, largely on Church cer emonies carried out with the wildest extravaganc e, he was led to stud y alche my, partly by curiosi ty and partl y as a means for restoring his shattered fortunes. Hearing that Germ any and Ita ly were th e countri es where alchemy flourished, he enlisted Italians in his service and was graduall y drawn into the further region of m agic. According to Hu ysmans, Gil les de Rais had rem ained unti l this moment a Christian mystic under the inf luence of Jeanne d'Arc, but aft er her dea th-- possibl y in despair --he of fered hi mself to the powers of darkness. Evokers of Satan now flock ed to hi m from ever y side, a mongst them Prelati, an Ita lian, by no me ans the old and wrinkled sorcerer of trad ition, but a y oung and attra ctive man of charm ing manners. For it was from Italy that came the m ost skilful adep ts in the art of al chemy, astrolog y, magic, and infernal evocat ion, who s pread themselves over Europe, parti cularl y France. Under the influen ce of these initiators Gil les de Rais signed a letter to the devi l in a me adow near Machecoul asking hi m for \"kno wledg e, power , and riches,\" and of fering in exchang e anything tha t might be asked of him with the excep tion of his life or his soul. But in spite"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"of this appeal and of a pac t signed with the blood of the writer , no Satani c appari tions were forth coming. It was then that, beco ming still more despera te, Gil les de Rais had recourse to the abominations for w hich his na me has rem ained infa mous--still more frigh tful invoc ations, lo athsom e debaucheri es, perverted vice in ever y form, Sadic cruelt ies, horribl e sacrif ices, and, fin ally, holocausts of l ittle boys and girls collec ted by his agents in the surrounding countr y and put to death with the m ost inhum an tortures. During the years 1432-40 l iterally hundreds of children disappeared. Man y of the na mes of the unhapp y little victims were preserved in the records of the period. Gilles de Rais met with a well-deserved end: in 1440 he was hanged and burnt. So far he does not appear to have found a paneg yrist to place him in the ranks of noble martyrs. It will, of course, be urged that the cri mes here described were those of a cri minal lunat ic and not to be a ttribu ted to any occul t cause; the answer to this is that Gilles was not an isolated uni t, but one of a group of occul tists who cannot all have been mad. Moreover , it was onl y after his invoca tion of the Evi l One that he deve loped these monstrous procl ivities. So also his eigh teenth- centur y replic a, the Marquis de Sade, co mbined with his abo minations an i mpassioned hatred of the Christi an rel igion. What is the explana tion of th is craze for ma gic in Western Europe? De schamps points to the Cabala, \"that science of dem oniacal arts, of which the Jews were the initiators,\" and undoubted ly in any comprehensiv e review of the question the inf luence of the Jewish Caba lists cannot be ignored. In Spain, Portugal, Provence, and Italy the Jew s by the fifteenth centur y had beco me a power; as ear ly as 1450 the y had penetr ated into the intellectua l circles of Florenc e, and i t was also in Ita ly that, a cen tury later, the m odern Caba listic school was inaugura ted by Isaac Luria (1533-72), w hose doctr ines were organiz ed into a pract ical system by the Hasidi m of Eastern Europe for the writing of amulets, th e conjuration of devils, m ystical juggler y with nu mbers and letters, etc. 224 Italy in the fift eenth centur y was thus a cen tre fro m which Cabal istic influenc es radia ted, and it may be tha t the Italians w ho indo ctrina ted Gilles de Rais had drawn their inspiration from this source. Indeed El iphas Lév i, who certa inly cannot be accused of \"Anti- Semitism,\" declares tha t \"the Jews, the most faithfu l truste es of the secre t of the Cabala, were al most always the reat masters of m agic in the Middl e Ages,\" 225 and suggests that Gilles de Rais took his monstrous recipes for using the blood of m urder ed chi ldren \"fro m some of those old Hebre w grimoir es (books on m agic), which, if they had been known, w ould have sufficed to hold up the Jews to th e execr ation of the whole earth.\" 226 Voltaire, in his Henriade , likewise at tributes the m agical blood-rit es pract ised in the sixteen th centur y to Jewish inspirat ion: Dans l'om bre de la nuit, sous une voûte obscure, Le silence conduit leui assemblée impure.

The Jews are ac cused of poisoning wells, of practising ritual murder, of using stolen church propert y for purposes of de secration, etc. No doubt there enters into all this a great a moun t of exagg eration, inspired by popular prejudice and me diæval superstit ion. Yet, whilst conde ming the persecution to which the Jews were sub jected on th is account, it must be admitted tha t they laid themselv es open to suspicion by their real add iction to magical arts. If ignoran t superstit ion is found on the side of the persecutors, still more amazing supersti tion is found on the side of th e persecut ed. Dem onolog y in Europe was in fact essenti ally a Jewish science, for although a beli ef in evi l spirits existed fro m the earliest times and has alwa ys continu ed to ex ist amongst prim itive races, and also amongst the ignor ant cl asses in civilized countri es, it was m ainly through the Jew s that these dark superstitions were im ported to the West, where they persisted not m erely amongst the lower strata of the Jewish population, but for med an essentia l part of Je wish tradition. Thus the Talmud says: If the eye could perce ive the demons tha t people the univ erse, existen ce would be impossibl e. The demons are m ore num erous than we are: th ey surround u s on al l sides like tren ches dug round vine yards. Ev ery one of us has a thousand on his lef t hand and ten thousand on his right.

H ow m uch of this fear communicated itself to the Gent ile population? It is at any rate a curious coinciden ce to notice the rese mblances betwe en so-call ed popular supersti tions and the writings of th e Rabbis. For exa mple, the vil e confessions m ade both b y Scotch and French peasan t women accused of witch craft concerning the nocturn al visi ts paid the m by male dev ils 230 find an exact counterp art in passages of th e Cabal a, where it is said tha t \"the demons are both male and fe male, and they also endeavour to consort with hu man beings--a conception from which arises th e beli ef in incubi and succubæ .\" 231 Thus, on J ewish author ity, we learn th e Judaic origin of this strange delusion. It is clear ly to the same source that we may trace the magical for mulæ for the healing of diseases curren t at the sa me period. Fro m the earl iest times th e Jew s had specialized in medicine, and m any royal personages insisted on e mploying Jewish doctors, 232 some of whom may have acqu ired m edical knowledge of a high order . The Jewish writer Margoliou th dwells on this fact with some complacenc y, and goes on to contrast th e scien tific methods of the Hebrew doctors with the quacker ies of the monks: In spite of the repor ts circul ated by the m onks, tha t the Jews were sorcerers (in consequenc e of the ir superior m edical skill), Christian patien ts would frequent the houses of the Jewish ph ysicians in prefer ence to the m onasteries, where cures were pretend ed to have been ef fected by some extraordin ary relics, such as the nai ls of St. Augustine, the extremity of St. Peter's second toe, ... etc. It need hardl y be added that the cures effected by the Jewish ph ysicians were m ore num erous than those b y the m onkish im postors. 233 Yet in real ity the grotesque re medies which Margoliouth attribu tes to Christ ian superstit ion appear to have been part ly deriv ed fro m Jewish sources. The author of a further article on Magic in Hastings' Encyclopæd ia goes on to say that the magical formulæ handed down in L atin in anci ent m edical writings and u sed by the m onks were mainly of Eastern orig in, derived from Babylonish, Eg yptian, and Jewish ma gic. The monks ther efore \"pla yed merely an inter mediate rôle.\" 234 Indeed, if we turn to the Talmud we shall find cures reco mmended no less absurd than those which Margoliouth derides.

M ost of these are too loathso me to transcribe ; but so me of the m ore innocuous are as follows: \"For epileps y kill a cock and let it putref y.\" \"In order to prot ect yourself from all evils, gird y ourself with the rope with which a criminal has been hung.\" Blood of dif ferent kinds also pla ys an importan t part: \"Fox' s blood and wolf' s blood are good for stone in the bladd er, ram's blood for colic, weasel blood for scrofula,\" etc.--these to be externa lly applied. 236 But to return to Satanis m. Whoever were th e secret inspirers of m agical and diabol ical practices during the fourteenth to the eighte enth cen turies, th e eviden ce of the existen ce of Satan ism during this long period is overwhel ming and rests on the actua l facts of histor y. Details quite as extravagan t and revol ting as those contain ed in the work s of Eliphas Lév i 237 or in Hu ysmans's Là-bas are given in docu mentary form by Margaret Alice Murra y in her singularl y passionl ess work rela ting principa lly to the witch es of Scotl and. 238 The cult of evil is a real ity--by whatev er means we ma y seek to explain it. Eliphas Lév i, whilst denying the existenc e of Satan \"as a superior personali ty and power,\" admits this funda mental truth : \"Evi l exists; it is i mpossibl e to doubt it. We can do good or evil. There are beings who kno wing ly and volunt arily do evil.\" 239 There are also beings who love evil. Lév i has ad mirably described the spirit that an imates such beings in his defin ition of black magic: Black magic is rea lly but a combin ation of sacrileg es and m urders gradua ted with a view to the per manent perversion of the hum an will and the reali zation in a living man of the monstrous phanto m of the fiend. It is, therefore, properl y speaking, the re ligion of the devil, the worship of darkness, the hatred of goodnes s exagg erated to the point of parox ysm; it is the incarn ation of death and the perm anent creation of hel l. 240 The Middle Ages, which depict ed the devil fleeing from holy wate r, were not perhaps quite so benight ed as our superior m odern culture has led us to suppose. For that \"hatred of goodness exaggera ted to the poin t of parox ysm,\" tha t impulse to desecr ate and defil e which forms the basis of black magic and has m anifested itself in successive phases of the world-revolut ion, springs from fear. So b y their very hatred the powers of darkness procl aim the exist ence of the powers of light and the ir own im poten ce. In th e cry of the demoniac: \"What have we to do with Thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art Thou come to destro y us? I know Thee who Thou art, the Hol y One of God,\" do we not hear the unwill ing tribute of the vanquished to the victor in the m ighty confl ict between good; and evi l?

A man whose methods appear to have approached to the mod ern concep tion of scientif ic research was Theophr astus Bom bastus von Hohenhei m, commonly known as Paracelsus, the son of a Germ an docto r, born about 1493, w ho during his travels in the East is said to have acquired a knowledge of some secret doctrine which he aft erwards elabora ted in to a system for the heal ing of diseases.

In al chemy they were the acknowledged leaders; the most noted a lchemist of the fourteenth centur y, Nicholas Flamel, discovered the secret of the art from the book of \" Abraha m the Jew, Prince, Priest, Levit e, Astrologer , and Philosopher ,\" and this ac tual book is said to have passed later in to the possession of Cardina l Riche lieu. 243 It was likewise fro m a Florentine Jew, Alemanus or D atylus, that Pico dell a Mirandol a, the fifteenth-cen tury mystic, rece ived instru ctions in the Caba la 244 and i magined that he had discovered in it the doctrin es of Christiani ty.

In this defen ce of Jewish literature he was supported b y the Duke of Bavari a, who appointed him profe ssor at Ingoldstad t, but was strongl y conde mned by the Dom inicans of Cologne. In repl y to th eir attacks Reuch lin launched his defence De Arte Cabalist ica , glorif ying the Cabala, of which the \"centr al doctrine for him was the Messianolog y around which al l its oth er doctr ines grouped the mselves.\" 245 His whole philosophica l system, as he hims elf admitted, was in fact entir ely Caba listic, and his views were shared by his conte mpor ary Cornel ius Agrippa of N etteshei m. As a result of these tea chings a cra ze for Caba lism spread a mongst Christian prela tes, states men, and warriors, and a num ber of Christ ian think ers took up the doctrines of the Caba la and \"essayed to work the m over in the ir own way.\" Athanasius Kircher and Knorr, Baron von Ro senro th, author of the Kabbala Denudata , in the course of the sevent eenth centur y \"endeavoured to spread the Cabala among the Christ ians b y transla ting Cabalist ic works w hich they regard ed as m ost anc ient wisdom .\" \"Most of the m,\" the Jewish Encyc lopædia goes on to observe derisiv ely, \"held the absurd idea that the Cabal a cont ained proof s of the truth of Christiani ty....

The \"Grand Legend\" of Ro sicrucianis m rests, however , on no histori cal evidenc e; ther e is, in fact, not the le ast reason to suppose tha t any such person as Christi an Rosenkreutz ever existed.

A simpler explana tion may be that th e Ros y Cross derived from the Red Cros s of the Templars. Mirabe au, who as a Freemason and an Illu minatus wa s in a position to discover many facts about the secret socie ties of Ger many during his sta y in the countr y, defin itely asserts that \"the Rose Croix Masons of the sevent eenth centur y were onl y the ancien t Order of the Templars secre tly perpe tuated.\" 253 Lecouteu lx de Cant eleu is mo re expl icit: In France the Knights (T emplar) who left the Order, henceforth hidden, and so to speak unknown, form ed the Order of the Flam ing Star and of the Rose-Croix, which in the fifteenth centur y spread itself in Bohe mia and Sil esia. Ever y Grand of ficer of these Orders had al l his life to wear th e Red Cross and to repea t ever y day the prayer of St. Bernard. 254 Eckert sta tes that the ri tual, symbols, and na mes of th e Rose-Croix were borrowed fro m the Templars, and that the Order was divided into seven degre es, according to the seven days of crea tion, at the same time signif ying tha t their \"princip al aim was that of the mysterious, the inv estigat ion of Being and of the forces of nature.\" 255 The Rosicrucian Kenneth Macken zie, in his Masonic Cyclopæd ia , appe ars to suggest the same possibility of Templar origin. Under the heading of Ro sicrucians he refers enigmatically to an invisibl e fratern ity that has existed fro m very ancien t times, as earl y as the days of the Crusades, \"bound b y solemn obligat ions of i mpen etrable secrec y,\" and joining toge ther in work for hum anity and to \"glor ify the good.\" At various periods of histor y this bod y has em erged into a sort of te mporar y light ; but its true na me has never transpir ed and is onl y known to the inner most adep ts and rulers of the society. \"The Rosicruc ians of the sixteenth centur y finall y disappeared and re-ent ered th is invisibl e fraternity \"--from which the y had presu mably emerged.

The writer here observes that it would be indiscr eet to sa y more, but elsewhere he throw s out a hint that may have some bearing on the matter, for in his arti cle on the Templars he sa ys that af ter the suppre ssion of th e Order it was revived in a mo re secre t form and s ubsists to th e present day. This would exactly accord with Mirabeau's state ment that the Rosicruci ans were onl y the Order of the Templars secre tly perpe tuated. Moreover , as we shall see lat er, according to a legend preserved by the Ro yal Order of Scotland, the degre e of the Rosy Cross had been instituted by that Order in conjunction with the Templars in 1314, and it would cer tainly be a rem arkab le coinciden ce tha t a man bearing the name of Rosenkreut z should happen to have inaugura ted a society, founded, like the Templars, on Eastern secret doctrines during the course of the same cen tury, withou t any connex ion exist ing between the two."},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"I would suggest, then, that Christian Rosenkreu tz was a purel y mythical personage, and that the whole legend concerning his trave ls wa s inven ted to disguise the real sources whence the Rosicruc ians derived their system, which would appe ar to have been a compound of ancien t esoter ic doctr ines, of Arabian and S yrian magic, and of Jewish Caba lism, partly inher ited from the Templars but reinforced by direct contac t with Caba listic Jew s in Germ any. The Rose-Croix, sa ys Mirabe au, \"were a mystical, Caba listic, theolog ical, and m agical sect,\" and Rosicrucian ism thus bec ame in the sevent eenth centur y the generi c title by which everything of the nature of Cabalis m, Theosoph y, Alche my, Astrolog y, and M ysticism was designat ed. For this reason i t has been said that they cannot be regarded as the descendants of the Templars. Mr. Waite, in referr ing to \"th e alleged connex ion betwe en the Templars and the Brethren of the Ros y Cross,\" ob serves: The Templars were not alche mists, the y had no scient ific pretensions, and their secre t, so far as it can be ascerta ined, was a rel igious secret of an ant i-Christi an kind. The Rosicruc ians, on the other hand, were pre-em inently a learn ed societ y and the y were also a Christian sect. 256 The fact that the Templars do not appear to have practised alche my is beside the point ; it is not pretended that the Rosicruc ians followed the Templars in ever y particular, but that they were the inheritors of a secret tradit ion passed on to the m by the earli er Order . Moreover , that they were a learned society, or even a socie ty at all, is not at all certain, for they would appear to have posses sed no organization lik e the Templars or the Freemasons, but to have consisted rather of isolat ed occul tists bound toge ther b y some tie of secre t knowledge concerning natural phenom ena.

The Rosicruc ian student of the Cabala, Julius Sperber , in his Echo of the Divinel y Illumina ted Frat ernity of the Admirable Order of the R.C.

B y no me ans, he answers: Christ established a new \"coll ege of m agic\" among His disciples, and the grea ter m ysteries were reve aled to St. John and St. Paul. John Yarker , quoting this pas sage, adds: \"This, Broth er Findel points out, was a cl aim of the Carpocrat ian Gnostics\"; it was also, as we have seen, a part of the Johannit e tradi tion which is said to have been i mparted to the Templars. We shall find the sa me idea of Christ as an \"init iate\" running al l through the secret societ ies up to the present da y. These doctrines not unnatura lly brought on the Rosicruc ians the suspicion of being an anti-Christi an bod y.

O RIGINS OF F REEMA SON RY \"The origin of Free masonr y,\" says a masonic writer of the eight eenth centur y, \"is kno wn to Freemasons alone.\" 265 If this was once the case, it is so no longer , for, although the question would certa inly appear to be one on which th e initiated should be m ost qualif ied to speak, the fac t is tha t no of ficial theory on the origin of Free masonr y exists; the great mass of the Freem asons do not know or care to know an ything about the histor y of the ir Order , whilst Masonic authori ties are entir ely disagre ed on the matter. Dr. Macke y admits that \"the origin and source whence first sprang the insti tution of Freem asonr y has given rise to mo re dif ference of opinion and discu ssion a mong m asonic scholars than any other topic in the li teratur e of the institu tion.\" 266 Nor is th is ignorance maintained merely in books for the general public, since in those specially addressed to th e Craft and at discussions in lodges th e sam e diversit y of opin ion prevai ls, and no dec isive conc lusions appear to be reached. Thus Mr . Albert Churchward, a Freem ason of the thirtieth degree, who deplores th e small amount of inter est taken in this matter by Mason s in general, observes: Hither to ther e have been so ma ny contr adictory opinions and theories in the at tempt to suppl y the origin and the reason whence, where, and wh y the Brotherhood of Freemasonr y came into existence, and al l the \"different parts\" and various ri tuals of the \"differen t degre es.\" All th at has been written on this has hither to been theories , without any facts for their fundation. 267 In the absence, therefore, of an y origin universall y recogniz ed by the Craft, it is surel y open to the l ay mind to specula te on the matter and to draw conclusions fro m histor y as to which of the m any explan ations put forward seems to suppl y the key to the mystery. According to the Royal Masonic Cyclopæd ia , no less than twelve theories have been advan ced as to the origins of th e Order , namely, that Masonr y derived : \"(1) Fro m the patri archs. (2) From the mysteries of the pagans. (3) Fro m the construct ion of Solo mon's Temple, (4) From the Crusades. (5) Fro m the Knights Templar. (6) Fro m the Roman Colleg ia of Artificers.

In rea lity modern Free masonr y is a dual system, a blend of two distinc t trad itions--of opera tive masonry, that is to say the actual art of build ing, and of speculative theor y on the grea t truths of life and death. As a well- known F reemason, the Count Goblet d'Alvie lla, has expres sed it: \"Specu lative Masonr y\" (that is to sa y, the dual s ystem we no w know as Freem asonr y) \"is the legitimate offspring of a fruitfu l union be tween the profes siona l guild of m ediæv al Masons and of a secret group of philosophica l Adepts, the first having furnished the form and the second the spirit.\" 268 In stud ying the origins of the present system we have therefore (1) to examine separat ely the histor y of ea ch of these two tradit ions, and (2) to discover their point of junction. O PERA TIVE M ASONR Y Beginn ing with the first of th ese two tradi tions, we find th at gui lds of w orking masons existed in ver y ancien t times. Withou t going back as far as anci ent Egypt or Greece, which would be be yond the scope of the present work, the course of these associations may be trac ed throughout the histor y of Western Europe fro m the beginn ing of the Christi an era. According to cert ain m asoni c writers, th e Druids original ly came from Egypt and brought with the m tradi tions rela ting to the ar t of build ing. The Culdees , who later on estab lished schools and colleg es in this coun try for the teach ing of arts, scien ces, and handicrafts, are said to have deriv ed fro m the Druids. But a mo re probab le source of inspir ation in the art of build ing are the Ro mans, who estab lished the famous col legia of archi tects referred to in the list of al ternative theories given in the Masonic Cyclopæd ia . Advoca tes of the Rom an Coll egia origin of Freemasonr y might be right as far as operativ e masonr y is conc erned, for i t is to th e period following on the Ro man occupat ion of Brit ain tha t our m asoni c guilds can with the greatest degree of certa inty be traced. Owing to the importanc e the art of build ing now acquir ed it is said that many distinguished m en, such as St. Alban, King Alfred, King Edwin, and King Athelst an, were nu mber ed amongst its patrons, 269 so that in time the guilds came to occup y the position of privil eged bodies and were known as \"free corpora tions\"; furth er that York was the first mason ic centre in England, largely under the contro l of the Culdees, who at the sa me period exerc ised m uch influenc e over th e Masonic Col legia in Scotl and, at Kilwinning, Melrose, and Aberdeen. 270 But it must be rem embered that a ll this is s peculation. No docum entary evidence has ever been produced to prove the ex istence of ma sonic guilds before th e famous York charter of A.D. 936, and even the date of this docu ment is doubtful. Only with the period of Gothi c architecture do w e reach fir m ground. That guilds of working ma sons kno wn in France as \"Compagnonn ages\" and in Germ any as \"Stein metzen\" did th en for m close corporat ions and possibly possess secre ts connect ed with their profession is m ore than probable.

Nevertheless we find th e assem blies of Mason s suppressed b y Act of Parl iament in the beginn ing of the reign of Henr y VI, and lat er on an ar med force sent b y Queen El izabe th to break up the Annual Grand Lodge at York. It is pos sible that the fraterni ty merely by the secrec y with which it was surrounded excit ed the suspic ions of authorit y, for nothing could be more law- abiding than its published statutes. Masons were to be \"true m en to God and the Holy Church,\" also to the masters tha t they served. They were to be honest in their m anner of life and \"to do no vill ainy whereb y the Craft or the Scien ce may be slandered.\" 272 Yet the sevente enth-cen tury writer Plot, in his Natural History of Sta ffordshire , expresses some suspicion with regard to the secrets of Free masonr y. That these could not be m erely trade secrets relat ing to the art of building, but that alread y some specula tive element had been introduced to the lodges, see ms the more probab le fro m the fac t that by the middle of the seventeen th cen tury not onl y noble patrons headed the Craft, but ordinar y gentlemen entir ely unconnected with build ing were rec eived into the fratern ity. The well- known entr y in the di ary of El ias Ashm ole under the da te of October 16, 1646, clear ly proves this fact: \"I wa s made a Free mason at Warrington in Lanc ashire with Col. Henr y Mainwaring of Karticha m [?] in Cheshire. The na mes of those tha t were then of the Lodge, Mr. Rich. Penket, Warden, Mr . James Coll ier, Mr. Rich. Sanke y, Henr y Littler, John Ell am, Rich.

We have then clear proof that alread y in the sevente enth centur y Free masonr y had ceased to be an association composed exclusivel y of me n conc erned with building, although eminent archi tects ranked high in the Order; Inigo Jones is said to have been Grand Master under Jam es I, and Sir Christopher Wren to have occupi ed the same position from about 1685 to 1702. But it was not unti l 1703 tha t the Lodge of St. Paul in London of ficially announced \"that the privileges of Masonr y should no longer be restric ted to operativ e Mason s, but extended to men of various professions, provided the y were regular ly approved and init iated into the Order .\" 275 This was followed in 1717 b y the great coup d'état when Grand Lodge was founded, and Specul ative Masonr y, which we now kno w as Free masonr y, was estab lished on a settled"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"basis with a ritua l, rules, and constitution drawn up in due form. It is at this i mpor tant date that the official histor y of Free masonr y begins. But before pursuing the course of the Order through what is known as the \"Grand Lodge Era,\" it is necessar y to go back and enquire into th e origins of the philosoph y that was now co mbin ed with th e system of opera tive masonr y. This is the point on which opinions are divided and to which the various theor ies sum marized in the Masonic Cyclop cædia relate. Let us exa mine each of th ese in turn. S PECULA TIVE M ASON RY According to cert ain sceptics conc erning the mysteries of Freem asonr y, the system inaugur ated in 1717 had no exist ence before tha t date, but \"was devised, pro mulg ated, and palm ed upon the world b y Dr. Desaguli ers, Dr . Anderson, and others, who then founded the Grand Lodge of England.\" Mr. Paton, in an admirable little pamphlet, 276 has shown the futi lity of this cont ention and also the injustice of represen ting th e founders of Grand Lodge as perpetra ting so gros s a decept ion. This 1717 theor y ascribes to me n of th e highest charact er the invent ion of a s ystem of mere impostur e.... It was brought forward with pretensions which its fram ers knew to be false pretensions of high antiqui ty; whereas ... it had newly been inven ted in their studies. Is this lik ely? Or is it reasonabl e to ascrib e such conduct to honourabl e men, without even assigning a probable motive for it? We have indeed onl y to stud y masonic ritua l--which is open to ever yone to read- -in order to arrive a t the same conclusion, that there could be no mo tive for this i mpostur e, and further that these two cl ergymen cannot be supposed to have evolved the whole thing out of the ir heads. Obviousl y some mov ement of a kindred nature must have led up to this crisis. And since El ias Ashm ole's diar y clear ly proves that a cere mony of m asoni c initiation had existed in the preceding centur y, it is surel y only reasonable to conc lude that Drs. Anderson and De sagul iers revised but did not originat e the ritua l and consti tutions drawn up b y them. Now, although the ritu al of Freemasonr y is couched in m odern and b y no m eans c lassical English, the ideas running through it cer tainly bear traces of extr eme antiqu ity. The central idea of Freemasonr y concern ing a loss which has befa llen man and th e hope of its ultimate recov ery is in fact no other than the anci ent secret trad ition described in the first chapter of th is book. Certain masonic writers indeed ascribe to Freem asonr y precisely the same genealog y as that of the ear ly Cabal a, dec laring that it descended from Adam and the first patr iarchs of the hum an rac e, and th ence through groups of Wise Men am ongst the Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, and Greeks. 277 Mr. Albert Churchward insists particularly on the Egyptian origin of the specul ative element in Free masonr y: \"Brother Gould and other Free masons will never understand the meaning and origin of our sacred tenets till they have studied and unlock ed the mysteries of the past.\" This study will then reveal the fact that \"the Druids, the Gymnosophists of India, the Magi of Per sia, and the Chald eans of Assyria had al l the same religious rit es and cere monies as prac tised b y their"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"priests who were in itiated to their Order, and tha t these were solemnly sworn to keep the doctr ines a profound secre t from the rest of m ankind. All these flowed from one source-- Egypt.\" 278 Mr. Churchward further quotes the speech of the Rev. Dr. William Dodd at the opening of a mason ic temple in 1794, who traced Free masonr y from \"the first astronom ers on the plains of Chaldea, the wise and mystic kings and priests of Eg ypt, the sages of Greece and philosophers of Rom e,\" et c. 279 But how did these trad itions descend to the masons of the West? According to a large body of m asoni c opinion in this coun try which recogn izes onl y a single source of inspira tion to the s ystem we no w know as Freem asonr y, the specula tive as well as the opera tive tradit ions of the Order descend ed fro m the build ing guilds and were im ported to England by means of the Rom an Coll egia. Mr. Churchward, however , strongl y dissents from this view: In the new and revised edition of the Perfec t Cere monies, ac cording to our E. working, a theor y is given th at Free masonr y origina ted fro m certa in guilds of work men which are well known in histor y as the \"Rom an Coll ege of Artific ers.\" There is no foundat ion of fact for such a theor y. Free masonr y is no w, and alwa ys was, an Eschatolog y, as ma y be proved by the whole of our signs, s ymbols, and words, and our ritua ls. 280 But what Mr. Churchward fai ls to expla in is how this eschato logy reached the working masons; moreover wh y, if as he asserts, it deriv ed fro m Eg ypt, Assyria, India, and Persia, Freemasonr y no longer bears the sta mp of these countr ies. For although vestiges of Sabeis m may be found in the decorat ion of the lodges, and brief references to the mysteries of Eg ypt and Ph œnicia, to the secret teaching of Pythagoras, to Euc lid, and to Plato in the Ritua l and instruc tions of the Craft degre es--neverthe less the for m in which the ancien t trad ition is cloth ed, the phraseolog y and pass-word s employed, are neith er Egyptian, Chaldean, Greek, nor Per sian, but Judaic. Thus although some portion of th e ancient secret tr adition m ay have penetr ated to Great Britain through the Druids or th e Romans- -versed in the lore of Greece and Eg ypt--another channel for its introduc tion was clearly the Caba la of the Jews. Cert ain m asoni c writers recogn ize this double tradit ion, the one descending from Egypt, Chaldea, and Greece, the oth er fro m the Israeli tes, and assert th at it is fro m the latter source their system is derived. 281 For after tracing its orig in from Adam , Noah, Enoch, and Abraha m, they proceed to show its lin e of descent through Moses, D avid, and Solom on 282 --descent from Solom on is in fact of ficially recogni zed b y the Craft and forms a part of the instruc tions to cand idates for init iation into the first degre e. But, as we have alread y seen, this is the precise genealog y attribu ted to the Caba la by the Jews. Moreover , mod ern Free masonr y is entire ly built up on the Solomonic, or rath er the Hiram ic legend. For the sake of readers unfam iliar with the ritual of Freemasonr y a brief résumé of this \"Grand Legend\" m ust be given here. Solomon, when building the Temple, emplo yed the services of a cer tain artificer in brass, named Hira m, the son of a widow of the tr ibe of Naphtha li, who was sent to hi m by Hiram, King of Tyre. So mu ch we know from the Book of King s, but the m asoni c legend"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"goes on to relate that Hiram , the widow 's son, referred to as Hiram Abiff, and described as the master-build er, met with an unti mely end. For the purpose of preserving order the masons working on the Temple were divided into thre e classes, Ent ered Apprentices, Fellow Crafts, and Master Masons, the first two dist inguished b y different pass-word s and grips and paid at different rates of wages, the last consist ing onl y of thre e persons-- Solomon himself, Hiram King of Tyre, who had provided him with wood and precious stones and Hira m Abiff. Now , before the completion of the Temple fifteen of the Fellow Crafts conspired togeth er to find out the secrets of the Master Mason s and resolved to waylay Hiram Abiff at the door of the Temple. At the last m oment twelve of the fift een drew back, but the remaining three carri ed out the fell design, and aft er threa tening Hiram in vain in order to obta in the secrets, kil led him with thre e blows on the head, deliv ered b y each in turn. They then conve yed the body away and buried it on Mount Moriah in Jerusale m. Solo mon, inform ed of the disappe arance of the m aster-builder , sent out fif teen Fellow Crafts to seek for him ; five of these, having arriv ed at the m ountain, noticed a plac e where the earth had been disturb ed and there discover ed the body of Hiram . Leaving a branch of aca cia to m ark the spot, they returned with their story to Solo mon, who ordered them to go and exhu me the body--an order that was immediately carri ed out. The murder and exhum ation, or \"raising,\" of Hiram , accompanied by extraordinar y lamentations, for m the cl imax of Craft Masonr y; and when it is re membered that in all probabi lity no such, traged y ever took pl ace, that possibl y no one known as Hira m Abiff ever existed, 283 the whole stor y can only be regarded as the surviva l of som e anc ient cult relating not to an actua l event, but to an esoteric doctrin e. A legend and a cere mony of this kind is indeed to be found in many earlier mythologies; the story of the m urder of Hiram had been foreshado wed by the Eg yptian legend of the murder of O siris and th e quest for his bod y by Isis, whilst the la mentations around th e tomb of Hiram had a count erpart in the mourn ing cer emonies for O siris and Adonis--both, like Hiram , subsequentl y \"raised\"--and later on in that which took place around the ca tafalque of Manes, who, like Hiram , was barbarousl y put to death and is said to have been known to the Manicheans as \"the son of the widow .\" But in the for m given to it by Free masonr y the legend is purel y Judaic, and would th erefore appear to have derived from the Judaic version of the anci ent tradit ion. The pi llars of the Temple, Jachin and Boaz, which pla y so impor tant a part in Craft Masonry, are symbols which occur in the Jewish Cabal a, where they are describ ed as two of the ten Sephiroths. 284 A writer of the eight eenth centur y, referr ing to \"f yve curiositi es\" he has discovered in Scotl and, describes one as-- The Mason word, which tho' som e make a Misterie of i t, I will not conce al a little of w hat I know . It is l yke a Rabbin ical Tradition in wa y of Co mment on Jachin and Boaz, the Two Pillars erec ted in Solomon's Temple with ane Addit ion del yvered fro m Hand to Hand, b y which they know and beco me familiar one with another . 285 This is precisel y the s ystem by which the Caba la was handed down a mongst the Jews. The Jewish Enc yclopæd ia lends colour to th e theor y of Cabalist ic trans mission by suggesting that th e stor y of Hira m \"may possibl y trace back to the Rabbinic legend"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"concerning the Temple of Solom on,\" tha t \"while all the workm en were killed so that th ey should not build anoth er temple devoted to idola try, Hira m himself was raised to Heaven like Enoch.\" 286 How did this Rabbin ic legend find its wa y into Freemasonr y? Advoca tes of the Rom an Collegia theor y explain it in the following manner. After the build ing of the Temple of Solomon the masons who had been engaged in the work were dispersed and a num ber m ade their wa y to Europe, some to Marseilles, som e perhaps to Rom e, where they may have introdu ced Judaic legends to the Coll egia, which then passed on to the Com acini Masters of the seventh centur y and fro m these to the mediæval working guilds of Engl and, France, and Germ any. It is said that during the Middle Ages a stor y concern ing the Temple of Solomon was current a mongst the compagnonnages of France. In one of these group s, known as \"the chi ldren of Solomon,\" the legend of Hiram appe ars to have existed m uch in its present for m; according to anoth er group the victi m of the murder was not Hira m Abiff, but one of his com panions named Maître Jacques, who, w hilst engaged with Hira m on the construc tion of th e Temple, met his dea th at the hands of five wicked Fellow Crafts, instiga ted by a sixth, the Père Soubise. 287 But the dat e at which this leg end origina ted is unkno wn. Clav el thinks that the \"Hebraic mysteries\" existed as earl y as the Ro man Colleg ia, which he describes as lar gely Judaiz ed 288 ; Yarker expresses precisel y the opposite view: \"It is not so dif ficult to connect Freemasonr y with the Collegi a; the dif ficulty lies in a ttribu ting Jewish tradi tions to the Collegia, and we sa y on the ev idence of the oldest charges tha t such tradi tions had no existence in Saxon ti mes.\" 289 Again: \"So far as this countr y is concern ed, we know nothing from docu ments of a Masonr y dating from Solo mon's Temple until after the Crusades, when the constitut ion bel ieved to have been sanction ed by King Athelstan gradua lly underwent a change.\" 290 In a discu ssion which took plac e recen tly at the Quatuor Coronati Lodg e the Hiram ic legend could onl y be traced back--and then without absolut e cert ainty--to the fourteenth centur y, which would coin cide with the date indicated by Yarker. 291 Up to this period the lore of the masonic guilds appears to have cont ained only the exoteric doctrines of Eg ypt and Greec e--which m ay have rea ched th em through the Roman Colleg ia, whilst the trad itions of M asonr y are traced from Adam, Jabal, Tubal Cain, from Nimrod and the Tower of Babel, with Her mes and Pythagor as as their more immediate progenitors. 292 These doctrin es were eviden tly in the m ain geo metrical or technica l, and in no sen se Cabalist ic. There is therefor e som e justification for Eckert's statement that \"the Judeo-Christ ian m ysteries were not yet introdu ced in to the mason ic corpora tions; nowhere can we find the least trace of the m. Nowhere do we find an y classification, not even tha t of m asters, fellow-crafts, and apprent ices. We observe no symbol of the Temple of Solom on; all their symbolism relates to mason ic labours and to a few philosophi cal maxims of mor ality.\" 293 The date at which Eckert, like Yarker , places the introduc tion of th ese Judaic e lements is the t ime of the Crusades."},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"But whilst recogni zing tha t modern Craft Masonr y is lar gely founded on the Cabala, it is necessary to distinguish between the different Cabal as. For by this date no less than three Caba las appear to have existed: firstl y, the anc ient secret trad ition of the patriarchs handed down fro m the Eg yptians through the Greeks and Ro mans, and po ssibly through the Rom an Col legia to the Craft Masons of Britain ; secondl y, the Jewish version of th is tradition, the first Cabala of the Jews, in no wa y incompatible with Christiani ty, descend ing fro m Moses, David and Solo mon to the Essenes and the m ore enlight ened Jews; and third ly, the perverted Cabal a, mingled by the Rabbis with m agic, barbaric superstit ions, and--after the death of Christ- -with anti- Christian legends. Whatever Cabalist ic elements were introduc ed into Craft Masonr y at the time of the Crusades appear to have belonged to the second of these trad itions, the unpervert ed Caba la of the Jews, known to the Essenes. There are, in fact, striking resemblanc es betwen Freem asonr y and Essenis m--degrees of ini tiation, oa ths of secrec y, the wearing of the apron, and a certa in masonic sign; whilst to the Sabe ist tradi tions of the Essenes ma y perhaps be traced the solar and stell ar symbolism of the lodges. 294 The Hiram ic legend may have belong ed to the sa me tradit ion. T HE T EMP LAR T RADI TION If then no docum entary evidence can be brought forward to sho w tha t either the Solomonic leg end or an y traces of Judaic symbolism and tradit ions existed either in the monuments of the period or in the ritu al of the m asons before the fourteen th cen tury, it is surely reasonable to recogniz e the plausibi lity of the cont ention put forward b y a grea t number of ma sonic writers--parti cularly on the Continent- -that the Judaic elements penetrated into Masonry by means of the Templars. 295 The Templars, as we have a lread y seen, had taken their na me from the Temple of Solom on in Jerusalem. What then more likely than tha t during the time they had lived there they had learnt the Rabbin ical legends connect ed with th e Temple? According to Geor ge Sand, who was deepl y versed in the histor y of secret socie ties, the Hira mic legend was adopted b y the Templars as symbolic of the destruction of their Order . \"The y wept over the ir impotence in the person of Hira m. The word lost and recov ered is th eir empire....\" 296 The Freemason Ragon likewise decl ares tha t the catastrophe they lamented was the ca tastrophe that destro yed their Order . 297 Further , the Grand Master whose fate they deplored was Jacques du Mola y. Here th en we have two bodi es in France at the same period, the Templars and the compagnonnages , both possessing a legend concern ing the Temple of Solo mon and both mourning a Maîtr e Jacques who had been barbarousl y put to death. If we accept the possibili ty that the Hiram ic legend existed amongst the masons before the Crusades, how are we to expla in this extraordinar y coinc idence? It is cer tainly easier to bel ieve that the Judaic tradi tions were introdu ced to the m asons b y the Templars and grafted on to the ancient lore tha t the masonic guilds had inher ited from the Rom an Coll egia. That som e connex ion exist ed between the Templars and the working masons is indica ted by the new influenc e that enter ed into building at this period. A modern Free mason comparing \"th e beaut ifully designed and deep-cut marks of the true Gothic period, sa y circa 1150-1350,\" with \"the carel ess and roughl y execu ted m arks, ma ny of the m mere"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"scratches, of lat er periods,\" poin ts out that \"the Knights Templars rose and fel l with th at wonderful develop ment of arch itecture.\" The same writer goes on to show that so me of the most impor tant masonic symbols, the equi lateral triangl e and the Mason's s quare surmounting two pill ars, ca me through fro m Gothic times. 298 Yarker asserts tha t the level, the flaming star , and the Tau cross which have since passed into the s ymbolism of Freemasonr y may be traced to the Knights Templar, as also the five- pointed star in Salisbur y Cathedra l, the double tri angle in Westminster Abbe y, Jachin and Boaz, the circle and the pentagon in the m asonr y of the fourteen th cen tury. Yarker cit es lat er, in 1556, the eye and crescent moon, the three stars and the ladder of five steps, as further evidences of Templar influ ence. 299 \"The Templars were l arge build ers, and Jacques du Mola y alleged the zeal of his O rder in decorat ing church es in the proces s aga inst hi m in 1310; hence the alleged connex ion of Templary and Free masonr y is bound to have a substratu m of truth.\" 300 Moreover , according to a m asoni c trad ition, an all iance defini tely took plac e between the Templars and the masonic guilds at this period. During th e proceed ings taken against th e Order of the Temple in France i t is said tha t Pierre d'Aumont and seven other Knights escaped to Scotl and in the guise of working m asons and landed in the Island of M ull. On St. John' s Day, 1307, th ey held their first chapte r. Robert Bruce th en took the m under his prote ction, and seven y ears la ter they fought under his standard at Bannockburn aga inst Edward II, w ho had suppressed their Order in Engl and. After this batt le, which took plac e on St. John the Baptist's Da y in sum mer (June 24), Robert Bruce is said to have institu ted the Royal Order of H.R.M. ( Heredo m) and Knights of th e R.S. Y.C.S. (Ro sy Cross). 301 These two degrees now constitu te the Royal Order of Scot land, and it see ms not improb able that in real ity they were brought to Scotland by the Templars. Thus, according to one of the early writers on F reemasonr y, the degree of the Rose-Croix origin ated with the Templars in Palestine as earl y as 1188 302 ; whilst the Eastern orig in of the word H eredo m, suppo sed to derive from a mythical mountain on an island south of the Hebrides 303 where the Culdees pract ised the ir rites, is indica ted by anoth er eigh teenth- century writer , who traces it to a Jewish source. 304 In this sa me year of 1314 Robert Bruce is said to have uni ted the Templars and the Ro yal Order of H .R.M. with the guilds of working m asons, who had also fought in his ar my, at the famous Lodge of Kilwinning, founded in 1286, 305 which now added to its na me that of Heredo m and beca me the chief seat of the Order . 306 Scotl and was es sentially a home of operat ive m asonr y, and, in vi ew of the Templar's prowes s in the art of building, what more natural than tha t the two bodies should ent er into an all iance? Alread y in Eng land the Temple is said between 1155 and 1199 to have administered th e Craft. 307 It is thus at Heredo m of Kilwinning, \"the Holy House of Ma sonry\"--\"Mother Kilwinning,\" as it is still known to Free masons--tha t a specul ative element of a fresh kind m ay have found its way into the lodges. Is it not here, then, that we ma y see th at \"frui tful union between th e professional guild of m ediæval masons and a secret group of phi losophical Adepts\" al luded to by Count Goblet d'Aviella and described b y Mr. Waite in the following words: The mystery of the building guilds--whatev er it may be held to have been--was that of a simple, unpolished, pious, and uti litarian device; and this daughter of Nature, in the absence of all inten tion on her own part, underwent, or was coerc ed into one of the"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"strangest marriages which has been celebra ted in occult histor y. It so happen ed tha t her particular for m and figure len t itself to such a union, etc. 308 ? Mr. Waite with his usual vagueness does not expla in when and where th is ma rriage took place, but the ac count would cer tainly apply to the alliance between the Templars and Scott ish guilds of working m asons, which, as we have seen, is ad mitted by masonic author ities, and presents exac tly the condi tions described, the Templars being peculiar ly fitted by their in itiation into the legend concerning the bui lding of th e Temple of Solom on to co-operate with the masons, and the masons being prepared by their partia l initiation into ancient m ysteries to receive the fresh inf lux of Eastern tradi tion fro m the Templars. A further indic ation of the Templar influ ence in Craft Masonr y is the system of degrees and initiations. The names of Ent ered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and Master Mason are said to have deriv ed fro m Scotland, 309 and the analog y between these and the degrees of the Assassins has alread y been shown. Indeed, the resem blance betwe en the outer organiz ation of Freem asonr y and the s ystem of th e Ism ailis is sho wn by many writers. Thus Dr . Bussell observes: \"No doubt together with som e knowledge of geo metry regard ed as an esoter ic trad e secret, many symbols to- day current did pass do wn fro m very prim itive times. But a mo re certain model was the Grand Lodge of the Ism ailis in Cairo\"- -that is to sa y the Dar-ul-Hik mat. 310 Syed Ameer Ali also expresse s the opinion that \"Makrisi's account of the dif ferent degre es of init iation adopted in this lodge for ms an invaluab le record of Freem asonr y. In fac t, the lodge a t Cairo beca me the mod el of a ll the Lodges crea ted af terwards in Christendo m.\" 311 Mr. Bernard Springe tt, a Freemason, quoting this passage, adds: \"In this last assertion I a m myself grea tly in agree ment.\" 312 It is surely therefore legitimate to surm ise tha t this system penetra ted to Craft Masonr y through the Templars, w hose connex ion with th e Assassins--of fshoot of the Dar -ul- Hikmat--was a m atter of com mon knowledge. The question of the Templar succession in Free masonr y forms perhaps the m ost controv ersial point in the whole histor y of the Ro man Colleg ia theor y, Contin ental Masons mor e genera lly accept ing it, and even glorying in it. 313 Macke y, in his Lexicon of Freemason ry , thus s ums up th e matter: The connexion between the Knights Templar and the Freemasons has been repea tedly asserted by the ene mies of both institu tions, and has often been ad mitted by their friends. Lawri e, on this subject, holds the following language : \"We know that th e Knights Templar not only possessed the mysteries but perform ed the cer emonies and incul cated the duties of Free masons,\" and he at tributes the dissolution of the Order to the discover y of the ir being Freem asons and the ir assem bling in secre t to prac tise th e rites of the Order . 314 This explains wh y Free masons have alwa ys shown indulg ence to the Templars.

For this purpose not only legends and unhistori cal facts were brought forward, but m anœuvres were also resorted to in order to suppress the truth. The m asonic reverers of the Temple Order bought up the whole edition of the Actes du Procès of Moldenhawer , because this sho wed th e guil t of the Order; only a few cop ies reached the book sellers.... Alread y several decades before ... the Free masons in their unhistorica l efforts had been guilt y of real forgery. Dupu y had published his History of the Trial of the Templars as earl y as 1654 in Paris, for w hich he had made use of the origina l of the Actes du Procès , according to which the guilt of the Order leav es no room for doubt.... But when in the m iddle of the eight eenth centur y severa l branch es of Freemasonr y wished to reca ll the Templar Order into be ing, the work of Dupu y was natur ally very displeasing. It had a lread y been current amongst th e public for a hundred years, so it could no longer be bought; therefore they falsified it. 315 According ly in 1751 a reprint of D upuy's work appe ared with the addi tion of a num ber of notes and rem arks and mutilated in such a wa y as to prove not the guilt but the inno cence of the Templars. Now, although British Masonr y has pla yed no part in these intr igues, the question of the Templar succession has been very inadequ ately dealt with by the m asonic writers of our countr y. As a rule they have adopted one of two courses--either they have persistent ly denied connexion with the Templars or the y have represen ted th em as a blam eless and cruelly maligned Order . But in real ity neither of these expedi ents is necessar y to save the honour of Brit ish Masonr y, for not even the bit terest enem y of Masonr y has ever suggested th at Bri tish m asons have adop ted an y portion of the Templar heres y. The Knights who fled to Scotland may have been perfe ctly innocent of the charges brought against the ir Order; inde ed, there is good reason to be lieve this was the case. Thus the Manuel des Chevali ers de l 'Ordre du Temple relates the incid ent in the fol lowing m anner : After the death of Jacques du Mola y, some Scottish Templars having beco me apostates, at the instiga tion of Rober t Bruce ranged the mselves under the banners of a new Order 316 instituted by this princ e and in which the rec eptions were based on those of the Order of the Temple. It is there that we mus t seek the origin of Scot tish Masonr y and even th at of the other m asonic rites. The Scott ish Templars were excom municated in 1324 b y Larmenius, who decl ared th em to be Templi desertor es and the Knights of St. John of Jerusale m, Dominiorum Milit iæ spoliator es , placed for ever outside th e pale of the Temple: Extra girum T empli, nunc et in futurum, volo, dico et jubeo. A similar anathe ma has since been laun ched b y severa l Grand Masters against Templars who were rebel lious to legit imate author ity. From the schis m that was introdu ced in to Scotland a number of sects took birth. 317 This account forms a com plete exonerat ion of the Scottish Templars; as apostat es from the bogus Christian Church and the doctrines of Johannis m they showed the mselv es loyal to the true Church and to the Christi an fai th as form ulated in the publ ished statut es of their Order .

It will be noticed, moreover , that in the ban pas sed by the Ordre du Temple on the Scott ish Templars th e Knights of St. John of Jeru salem are also inc luded. This is a further tribute to the orthodox y of the Scot tish Knights. For to the Knights of St. J ohn of Jerusale m--to who m the Templar propert y was given- -no suspicion of heres y had ever attached. After the suppres sion of the Order of the Temple in 1312 a nu mber of the Knights joined the mselves to the Knights of St. John of Jerusale m, by whom the Templar system appears to have been pur ged of i ts hereti cal elements. As we s hall see later, the same process is said to have been carr ied out by the Ro yal Order of Scotland, All th is suggests that the Templars had i mpor ted a secret doctr ine from the E ast which was capable either of a Christian or an ant i-Christi an interpr etation, th at through their connex ion with th e Royal Order of Scotland and the Knights of St. John of Jerusale m this Christi an int erpreta tion was preserved, and final ly that it was this pure doctrin e which passed into Freem asonr y. According to early mason ic author ities, the adop tion of the two St. Johns as the patron saints of Masonr y arose, not fro m Johannis m, but fro m the alliance betwe en the Templars and the Knights of St. John of Jeru salem. 318 It is im portan t to remember that the th eory of the Templar connex ion with Freemasonr y was held b y the Continen tal Freem asons of the eighte enth cen tury, who, liv ing at the ti me the Order wa s reconst ituted on its present basis, were cle arly in a bett er position to know its origins than we who are separated from that date by a distanc e of two hundred y ears. But since the ir testi mony first comes to l ight a t the period of the upper degrees, in which the Templar influenc e is m ore clear ly visibl e than in Craft Masonr y, it must be reserved for a later chapte r. Before passing on to this further stage in the histor y of the Craft, it is necessary to consider one more link in the chain of the m asoni c trad ition- -the \"Hol y Vehm.\" T HE V EHMGERICHTS 319 These dread tribun als, said to have been established by Charle magne in 772 320 in Westphal ia, had for their avowed object the estab lishment of law and order a midst the unsett led and even anarch ic conditions th at then reigned in Ger many. But b y degrees the power arroga ted to itself by the \"Hol y Vehm\" beca me so form idable tha t succeed ing emperors were unable to contro l its workings and found the mselves forced to beco me initiates fro m motives of self- protect ion. During the twelfth centur y the Vehmgerichts, by their cont inual execut ions, had crea ted a veritab le \"Red Terror,\" so that the East of Germany was known as the Red Land. In 1371, sa ys Lecou teulx de Cante leu, a fresh impetus was given to the \"Hol y Vehm\" by a number of the Knights Templar who, on the dissolution of their Order , had found the ir wa y to Ger many and now s ought admission to the Secret Tribunals. 321 How m uch of Templar lore passed into the hand of th e Vehmgerichts it is im possible to know , but there is cert ainly a resem blance between the methods of init iation and in timidation emplo yed by the Vehms and those described b y certain of the Templars, still more betwe en the ceremony of the Vehms and the ritual of Freemasonr y."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"Thus the members of the Vehms, known as the Wissende (or Enl ighten ed), were divid ed into three degrees of ini tiation: the Free Judges, the veritab le Free Judges, and the Hol y Judges of the Secre t Tribuna l. The cand idate for ini tiation was led bl indfold before the dread Tribunal, presided over b y a Stuhlherr (or m aster of the chair) or his s ubstitu te, a Freigraf , with a sword and branch of willow at his side. The in itiate was then bound b y a terrible oath not to revea l the secrets of the \"Holy Vehm,\" to warn no one of danger threatening the m by its decr ees, to denounc e anyone, whether fathe r, mother, brother , sister , friend, or rel ation, if such a one had been conde mned b y the Tribunal. After th is he was given th e pass word and grip b y which the confedera tes recogni zed ea ch othe r. In the event of his turning traitor or revea ling th e secrets conf ided to him his e yes were bandag ed, his hands tied behind his back, and his tongue was torn out through the back of his neck, after which he was hanged b y the feet till he was dead, with the sole mn imprecation tha t his bod y should be given as a pre y to the birds of th e air. It is dif ficult to bel ieve that the points of resem blanc e with mod ern m asonic ritua l 322 which may here be discerned can be a mere matter of coinc idence, yet it would be equally unreasonab le to trace the orig ins of Freem asonr y to the Vehmg erichts. Clearl y both derived fro m a common source, ei ther the old pagan tradit ions on which the early Vehms were founded or the system of the Templars. The latter see ms the more probabl e for two reasons: first ly, on ac count of the resem blance between the methods of th e Vehmgerichts and the Assassins, which would be expl ained if the Templars for med the conne cting link; and secondl y, the fac t that in cont emporar y docum ents the m embers of the Secret Tribunals were frequen tly referr ed to under the na me of Rose-Croix. 323 Now, since, as we have seen, the degree of the Ros y Cros s is said to have been brought to Europe by the Templars, this would ac count for the persistence of the name in the Vehmgerichts as well as in the Rosicruc ians of the seventeen th centur y, who are said to have continued the Templar trad ition. Thus Templarism and Rosicruci anism appear to have been alwa ys closely conne cted, a fact which is not surprising since both derive from a common source- -the trad itions of th e near East. This brings u s to an altern ative theor y concerning the chann el through which Eastern doctr ines, and part icularly Caba lism, found their way into Free masonr y. For it m ust be admitted tha t one obstac le to the co mplete acc eptanc e of the theor y of the Templar succession exists, namely, that although the Judaic element cannot be traced further back than the Crusades, nei ther can it with cert ainty be pronounced to have co me into existence during the three cen turies th at fol lowed afte r. Indeed, before the publica tion of Anderson' s \"Constitu tions\" in 1723 there is no defin ite evidenc e that the Solomonic legend had been incorpora ted into the ritual of British Masonr y. So although the posses sion of the legend by the compagnonnages of the Middle Ages would tend to prove its antiqui ty, there is alwa ys the possibility that it was introdu ced b y some later body of adepts than the Templars. According to the part isans of a further theor y, these adepts were the Rosicrucians. R OSICRUCIAN O RIGIN"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"One of the earli est and m ost eminent precursors of Free masonr y is said to have been Francis Bacon. As we have alr eady seen, Bacon is recogni zed to have been a Rosicrucian, and that th e secret philosophica l doctr ine he profes sed was closel y akin to Freem asonr y is clearly apparent in his New Atlantis . The referen ce to the \"W ise Men of the Socie ty of Solomon's Hou se\" cannot be a mere coincid ence. The choic e of Atlantis--th e legend ary island suppo sed to have been submerged by the Atlan tic Ocean in the remote past--would suggest tha t Bacon had som e knowledge of a secret tradit ion descending from the earliest patriarchs of the hum an race, whom , like the modern writer Le Plongeon, he i magined to have inhabi ted the Western hemisphere and to have been th e predec essors of the Egyptian initiates. Le Plongeon, however , places this ear ly seat of the m ysteries stil l further West than the Atlant ic Ocean, in the region of Ma yax and Yucatan. 324 Bacon further rel ates th at this tradit ion was preserved in its pure for m by certain of the Jews, w ho, whilst accept ing the Cabala, rejected its anti- Christian tendenc ies. Thus in this island of Bensale m there are Jews \"of a far dif fering dispo sition fro m the Jews in other parts. For whereas the y hate the na me of Christ, and have a secret inbred rancour aga inst the people amongst whom they live; these contrariwise give unto our Saviour m any high attribut es,\" but at the sa me time they believ e \"that Moses by a secre t Caba la ordain ed the laws of Bensale m which they now u se, and that when the Messiah should co me and sit on His throne at Jerusale m, the King of Bensal em should sit at His feet, whereas other kings should keep at a great dist ance.\" This passage is of particu lar in terest as showing tha t Bacon recogniz ed the diver gence between the anc ient secret trad ition descending from Moses and the perver ted Jewish Cabal a of the Rabbis, and tha t he was perfec tly aware of the tendenc y even a mong the best of Je ws to turn the for mer to the advantag e of the Messianic dreams. Mrs. P ott, who in her Francis Bacon and his Secr et Society sets out to prove that Bacon was the founder of Ro sicrucianism and Free masonr y, ignores al l the previous histor y of the secret tradit ion. Bacon was not the origin ator but the inher itor of the ide as on w hich both these societ ies were founded. And the further conten tion tha t Bacon was at the same time the author of the grea test dra mas in the English l anguage and of The Chymical Marriage of Christian Roseng reutz is ma nifest ly absurd. Neverthe less, Bacon's influenc e amongst the Rosicruc ians is apparen t; Heydon's Voyage to the Land of the Rosicrucians is in fact a mere plagiar ism of Bacon's New Atlantis . Mrs. P ott seems to imagine that by procla iming Bacon to have been the founder or even a member of th e Order of Free masonr y she is reve aling a great masonic secret which Freemasons have conspired to keep dark. But wh y should the Craft desire to disown so illustrious a progenitor or seek to concea l his connex ion with th e Order if an y such existed? Findel, indeed, frankl y admits tha t the New Atlantis contained unm istakab le allusions to Free masonr y and that Bacon contr ibuted to its final tr ansform ation. 325 This was doubtless brought abou t largely by the English Rosicruc ians who followed aft er. To suggest then that Freemasonr y origin ated with the Rosicrucians is to ignore the previous histor y of the secret tradi tion. Rosicrucianis m was not the beg inning but a link in the long chain connec ting Freemasonr y with far earli er secret associations. The resem blance betwe en the two O rders ad mits of no denia l. Thus Yarker w rites: \"The symbolic tracing"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"of the Rosicrucians was a Square Temple approached by seven steps ... here also we find the two pill ars of Herm es, the five-point ed star , sun and m oon, compasses, s quare and triangle.\" Yarker further observes that \"even Wren was more or less a student of Hermeticism, and if we had a full list of Free masons and Ro sicrucians we should probabl y be surprised at the nu mbers who belonged to both systems.\" 326 Professor Bühle e mphatically states tha t \"Free masonr y is neither more nor les s than Rosicruc ianism as mod ified by those who transplant ed it into England.\" Cha mbers, who published his fam ous Cyclopædia in 1728, ob serves: \"Som e who are no friends to Freemasonr y, make the present flourishing society of Free masons a branch of Rosicruc ians , or rather the Rosicruc ians the mselves under a new name or rel ation, viz. as retainers to building. And it is cer tain there are som e Free masons w ho have all the characters of Ro sicrucians.\" The connexion between Free masonr y and Rosicruci anism is, ho wever , a question hardl y less controv ersial than tha t of the connexion between Free masonr y and Templarism. Dr. Macke y violen tly disputes the theor y. \"The Rosicruc ians,\" he writ es, \"as this brief histor y indica tes, had no connex ion whatever with the masonic fraterni ty. Notwithstand ing this fact, Barrue l, the most malignant of our revil ers, with a characteristic spirit of m isrepresenta tion, a ttempted to ident ify the two institu tions.\" 327 But the aforesaid \"brief histor y\" indic ates nothing of the kind, and the reference to Barrue l as a m alignan t revi ler for suggesting a connexion, which, as we have seen, m any Freemasons ad mit, shows on w hich side this \"spirit of m isrepr esentat ion\" exists. It is interesting, howeve r, to not e that in the eyes of cert ain m asonic writers connexion with the Rosicrucians is regarded as highl y discredi table; the fratern ity would thus appe ar to have been less bla meless than we have been taught to beli eve. Mr . Waite is equal ly concerned with proving that there \"is no trace able connexion be tween Masonr y and Rosicruc ianism,\" and he goes on to exp lain that Freemasonr y was never a le arned socie ty, that it never la id claim to \"an y transc endenta l secre ts of alche my and m agic, or to an y skill in m edicine,\" etc. 328 The truth m ay lie between the opposing cont entions of Prof. Bühle and his two m asonic antagonists. The Free masons were clear ly, for the reasons given b y Mr. Waite, not a mere continuation of the Rosicrucians, but more likely borro wed from the Rosicruc ians a par t of the ir system and symbols which they adapted to their own purpo se. Moreover , the incon trovert ible fact is that in the list of Engl ish Freemasons and Rosicruci ans we find men who belonged to both Orders and am ongst th ese two who contribut ed lar gely to th e consti tutions of English Free masonr y. The first of these is Robert Fludd, whom Mr. Waite describes as \"the centra l figure of Rosicruc ian literature, ... an intel lectual giant, ... a ma n of i mmense erudition, of exal ted mind, and, to judge b y his writings, of extre me personal sanct ity. Enne moser describes him as one of the most distingu ished discipl es of Paracelsus....\" 329 Yarker adds this clue: \"In 1630 we find Fludd, the chi ef of the Rosicrucians, using arch itectural languag e, and there is proof tha t his Societ y was divided in to degrees, and from the fact that th e"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Masons ' Compan y of London had a copy of the Masonic Char ges 'present ed by Mr. fflood' we m ay suppose tha t he was a Free mason before 1620.\" 330 A still more import ant link is El ias Ashmole, the ant iquar y, astrologer , and alch emist, founder of the Ashmolean Mu seum at Oxford, who wa s born in 1617. An avowed Rosicruc ian, and as w e have seen, also a Freemason, Ashmole displa yed great ener gy in reconst ituting the Craft; he is said to have perfec ted its organization, to have added to it further mystic symbols, and accord ing to Ragon, it was he who drew up the ri tual of the existing thre e Craft degrees--Enter ed Apprent ice, Fellow-Craft, and Ma ster Mason-- which was adopted by Grand Lodge in 1717. Whence did these fresh inspira tions co me but from the Rosicrucians? For, as Ragon also inform s us, in the year that Ashmole was received into Free masonr y the Rosicruc ians held their meeting in th e sam e room at Mason Hall! 331 How, then, can it be said that there was \"no tra ceable connex ion between Freem asonr y and Rosicrucianis m?\" and wh y should it be the part of a \" malignan t revi ler\" to connect them? It is not suggested tha t Rosicruci ans, such as Fludd or Ashmo le, imported any magical elements in to Free masonr y, but si mply the s ystem and s ymbols of the Rose- Croix with a cer tain degree of esoter ic learning. That Rosicruc ianism forms an import ant link in the chain of the secre t tradi tion is therefore undeniabl e. T HE S EVENTE ENTH -C ENTUR Y R ABBIS There is, however , a third chann el through which the Judaic legends of Freemasonr y may have penetra ted to the Craft, namely, the Rabbis of the seventeen th centur y. The Jewish writer Bernard La zare has declared that \"there were Je ws around the cradl e of Freemasonr y,\" 332 and if this stat ement is appli ed to th e period preceding the insti tution of Grand Lodge in 1717 it certa inly finds confirm ation in fact. Thus it is said tha t in th e preceding cen tury the coat- of-arms now u sed b y Grand Lodge had been designed b y an Amsterda m Jew, Jacob Jehuda Leon Templo, col leagu e of Cro mwell's friend the Caba list, Manasseh ben Israel. 333 To quote Jewish author ity on th is question, Mr . Luc ien Wolf writes that Templo \"had a mono mania for ... ever ything rel ating to the Temple of Solomon and the Taberna cle of the Wilderness. He construct ed gigant ic mod els of both these edific es.\" 334 These he exhibi ted in London, which he visi ted in 1675 and earl ier, and it seem s not unreasonab le to conclude that this m ay have provided a fresh source of inspira tion to the Free masons w ho fra med the mason ic ritual some forty years later. At any rate, the masonic coat- of-arms still used b y Grand Lodge of Engl and is undoubted ly of Jewish design. \"This coat,\" sa ys Mr. Luci en Wolf, \"is entir ely composed of Jewish s ymbols,\" and is \"an attempt to displ ay herald ically the various for ms of the Cherubi m pictured to us in the second vision of Ezeki el--an O x, a Man, a Lion, and an Eagl e--and thus be longs to the highest and m ost m ystical dom ain of Hebrew s ymbolism.\" 335 In other word s, this vision, known to the Jews as the \"Mercaba,\" 336 belongs to the Caba la, where a particu lar in terpret ation is placed on each figure so as to provide an esoteri c"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"meaning not percept ible to the uninit iated. 337 The mason ic coa t-of-ar ms is thus entire ly Caba listic; as is also the seal on the diplo mas of Craft Masonry, where another Caba listic figure, that of a m an and wom an co mbined, is reproduc ed. 338 Of the Jewish influ ence in Ma sonry after 1717 I shall speak lat er. To sum up, then, the origins of the s ystem we now know as F reemasonr y are not to be found in one source alone. The twelv e alternative sources enu merated in the Masonic Cyclopædia and quoted at the beginn ing of this chapter may all have contribut ed to i ts formation. Thus Operat ive Masonr y may have descended from the Rom an Coll egia and through the opera tive masons of the Middle Ages, w hilst Specula tive Masonry may have deriv ed fro m the patri archs and the mysteries of the pagans. But the source of inspiration which admits of no den ial is the Jewish Cabala. Whether this penetr ated to our countr y through the Ro man Colleg ia, the compagnonnages , the Templars, the Rosicruc ians, or through the Jew s of th e sevente enth and eighte enth cen turies, whose act ivities behind the scenes of Free masonr y we s hall see later, is a m atter of speculation. The fac t remains that when the ritua l and consti tutions of M asonr y were drawn up in 1717, although cer tain fragments of the ancien t Egyptian and Pythagor ean doc trines were re tained, the Judaic version of the secret tradi tion was the one select ed by the founders of G rand Lodge on which to build up their s ystem. 6. T HE G RAND L ODGE E RA Whatever were the origins of the Order we now kno w as Free masonr y, it is clear that during the cen tury preced ing its reor ganization under Grand Lodg e of London the secret system of binding m en together for a co mmon purpose, based on East ern esoteri c doctr ines, had been anticipated by the Rosicrucians. Was this secret system employed, however b y any other bod y of m en? It is cer tainly easy to imagine how in this momentous sevente enth centur y, when m en of all opinions were coa lescing against opposing forces--Lu therans co mbining against the Papac y, Catholi cs rall ying their forces against invad ing Protestant ism, Republ icans plo tting in favour of Cro mwel l, Royalists in their turn plotting to restore the Stuarts, finall y Royalists plo tting against each other on behalf of riva l dynasties- -an or ganiza tion of th is kind, enabl ing one to work secre tly for a cause and to set invisibl y vast num bers of hu man beings in m otion, m ight prove invaluable to an y party. Thus, accord ing to certa in masonic writers on the Continent, the system used by the Rosicruc ians in the ir fight against \"Poper y\" was also employed by the Jesuits for a directly oppo site purpose.

Finall y, Elias Ashmole, the Rosicruci an Ro yalist, is said to have turned the masoni c system against Cro mwel l, so that towards the end of th e sevente enth cen tury the Order ral lied to the Stuart cause. 342 But all this is pure specula tion resting on no basis of known facts. The accusation that the Jesuits used the system of the Rose-Croix as a cover to polit ical intrigu es is referred to by the Rosicrucian Eliph as Lévi as the outco me of ignor ance, which \"refutes itse lf.\" It is signifi cant to noti ce tha t it emanates m ainly from Germ any and from the Il luminati; the Prince of He sse was a m ember of the Stricte Observance and Mirabeau an Illu minatus at the time he wrote the passage quoted above. That in the seventeen th cen tury certain Jesuits pla yed the part of poli tical intriguers I suppose their warm est friends will hardl y deny, but that they employed any secret or mason ic system seems to m e perfect ly incapable of proof. I shall return to th is point l ater, howeve r, in connex ion with the Illuminati. As to Cromw ell, the onl y circu mstance that lends an y colour to the possibil ity of his connex ion with Free masonr y is his known friendship for Manasseh ben Israel, the colleague of the Rabbi Templo who designed the coa t-of-ar ms later adopted by Grand Lodge. If, therefore, the Jews of Amsterda m were a source of inspiration to the Freemasons of th e sevente enth cen tury, it is not i mpossible tha t Cro mwel l may have been the channel through which this influen ce first penetra ted. In the matter of the Stuarts we are, howeve r, on fir m ground with regard to Freem asonr y. That the lodges at the end of the seventeen th cen tury were Ro yalist is cer tain, and there seems good reason to beli eve tha t, when the revolut ion of 1688 divided the Royalist cause, the Jacobi tes who fled to France with Ja mes II took Free masonr y with them. 343 With the help of th e French the y establ ished lodges in which, it is said, mason ic rites and symbols were used to prom ote the cause of the Stuarts. Thus the land of pro mise signified Great Brita in, Jerusale m stood for London, and the murder of Hiram represent ed the execution of Charles I. 344 Meanwhil e Free masonr y in England did not con tinue to adhere to the Stuart cause as it had done under the ægis of Elias Ashmole, and b y 1717 is said to have becom e Hanoveri an.

In 1717 for the first time Freemasonr y was estab lished on a settled basis and in the process underwent a funda mental change. So far it would see m to have retain ed an opera tive element, but in the transform ation tha t now took pla ce this wa s entirely eliminated, and th e whole Order was transform ed into a middle- and upper -class specula tive body. This coup d'état , already suggested in 1703, took pla ce in 1716, w hen four London lodges of Free masons met together at the Apple Tree Tavern in Charles Street, Coven t Garden, \"and hav ing put into the chair the oldest Master Mason (now the Master of a lodge), they consti tuted themselves a Grand Lodge, pro tempo re , in due form .\" On St. John the Bapt ist's Day, June 24 of the next y ear, the annual asse mbly and banque t were held at the Goose and Gridiron in St. Paul's Church yard, when Mr . Antony Sayer was elected Grand Master and invest ed with a ll the badges of of fice. 345 It is evident from the above accoun t that already in 1717 the specula tive elements m ust have predom inated in the lodg es, otherwise we m ight expec t to find the opera tive masons taking som e part in these proceedings and expressing their opinion as to whether the ir associa tion should pass under the control of me n entirely unconnect ed with th e Craft. But no, the leaders of the new m ovement all appear to have belonged to the middle class, nor from this mo ment do ei ther m asons or arch itects seem to have pla yed any prominent part in Freemasonr y. But the point that official histor y does not attempt to eluc idate is the reason for this decision. Why should the Freemasons of London--whether they were a t this dat e a specul ative or onl y a semi-specula tive association- -have suddenl y recognized the necessity of establ ishing a Grand Lodge and drawing up a ritual and \"Constitu tion\"? It is evident, th en, that some circumstanc es mus t have arisen which led them to tak e this impor tant step. I would suggest that the following m ay be the solution to the proble m. Freemasonr y, as we have seen, was a s ystem that cou ld be e mployed in any cause and had now come to be used by intriguers of ever y kind--and not onl y by intriguers, but b y merely conv ivial bodies, \"joll y Brotherhoods of the Bott le,\" who m odelled them selves on masoni c associat ions. 346 But the honest c itizens of London who me t and feasted at the Goose and Gridiron were clear ly not in triguers, the y were neith er Ro yalist nor Republ ican plotters, neither Cathol ic nor Luth eran fana tics, neither alche mists nor magicians, nor can it be suppo sed that they were si mply revel lers. If the y were polit ical, they were cert ainly not supporters of the Stuarts; on the contrar y, they were general ly report ed to have been Hanoveri an in their s ympathies, inde ed Dr . Bussell goes so far as to say that Grand Lodge was insti tuted to support the Hanoverian d ynasty. 347 It would be perhaps near er the truth to conclude that if the y were Hanoverian it was because they were const itutional, and the Hanoveri an dynasty having now been estab lished the y wished to avoid further changes. In a word, then, they were si mply men of peace, anxious to put an end to dissensions, who, seeing the s ystem of Masonr y utilized for the purpose of pro moting discord, deter mined to wrest it fro m the hands of poli tical intriguers and restore it to its origin al char acter of brotherhood, though not of brotherhood between working m asons onl y, but between men drawn fro m all classes and profes sions.

According to Nicola i this pacifi c purpose had alr eady animated Engl ish Freemasons under the Grand Mastership of Sir Christopher Wren: \"Its principa l object fro m this period was to moderate the relig ious hatreds so terrib le in England during the reign of James II and to try and establish so me kind of concord or fraterni ty, by weakening as far as possible th e antagon isms arising fro m the dif ferences of rel igions, ranks, and interests.\" An eigh teenth- centur y manuscript of the Prince of Hes se quoted b y Lecouteulx de Canteleu expresses the view that in 1717 \" the mysteries of Freemasonry wer e reformed and pu rified in England of all political tendenci es .\" In the matter of rel igion, Craft Masonr y adopted an equal ly non-sectar ian at titude. The first \"Con stitutions\" of the Order , drawn up b y Dr. Anderson in 1723, contain the following paragraph : C ONCERN ING G OD AND R ELIGION A Mason is obliged, by his tenure, to obe y the moral Law; and if he right ly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irrel igious Liber tine. But though in ancient Times Mason s were charged in ever y Countr y to be of the Re ligion of that Countr y or Nation, whatever it was, yet, 'tis no w though t more expedien t only to oblige them to that Re ligion in which al l men agree, leaving their particu lar Opinions to themselves; that is to be good Men and true, or Men of Honour and H onest y, by whatever Deno minations or Persuasions the y may be dist inguish'd; whereb y Masonr y beco mes the Centr e of Union and the Means of Concil iating true Friendship among Persons that must have remained at a perpetu al Distanc e. The phrase \"that Relig ion in which all men agree\" has been censured by Cathol ic writers as advoca ting a universal religion in the place of Christian ity. But this b y no m eans follows. The idea is surel y that Masons should be m en adhering to that law of right and wrong co mmon to all religious faiths. Craft Masonr y may thus be described as Deist in character, but not in the accept ed sense of the word which implies the reject ion of Christi an doctr ines. If Free masonr y had been Deist in this sense m ight we not expe ct to find some connexion between th e founders of Grand Lodge and the school of D eists-- Toland, Bolingbroke, Woolston, Hu me, and others--which flour ished precise ly at this period? Might not some analog y be dete cted between th e organiza tion of the Order and the Sodalit ies described in Toland's Panthe isticon , published in 1720 ? But of this I can find no trace whatever. The princ ipal founders of G rand Lodge were, as we have seen, clergymen, both engaged in preach ing Christian doctrin es at the ir respec tive churches. 348 It is surely therefore reasonable to conc lude tha t Free masonr y at the time of its reorganization in 1717 was Deistic only in so far th at it invi ted m en to m eet toge ther on the common ground of a beli ef in God. Moreover , some of the ear ly Engl ish ritua ls contain dist inctly Christian elements. Thus both in Jachin and Boaz (1762) and Hiram o r the Grand Master Key to the Door of both Antient and Modern F reemasonry by a Member of th e Royal Arch (1766) we find pra yers in the lodges conc luding with the na me"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"of Christ. These passages were replac ed much later by purel y Deist ic for mulas under the Grand Mastership of the free-th inking Duke of Sus sex in 1813. But in spite of its innocuous chara cter, Freem asonr y, merely by reason of its secrec y, soon began to excit e alarm in the publi c mind. As earl y as 1724 a work ent itled The Grand Mystery of the Freemasons Discover ed had provoked an angr y remonstranc e from the Craft 349 ; and when the French edic t against the Order was passed, a le tter signed \"Jachin\" appeared in The Gentl eman's Magazine declaring the \"Free masons who have lately been suppressed not onl y in France but in Holland\" to be \"a dangerous Race of Men\": No Governm ent ought to suf fer such cland estine Assemblies where Plots against th e State may be carri ed on, under th e Pretenc e of Brother ly Love and good Fellowship. The writer, evident ly unaware of possible Templar tradit ions, goes on to observe tha t the sentin el placed at the door of the lodge with a drawn sword in his hand \"is not the onl y mark of their being a military Order\"; and suggests that the ti tle of G rand Master is taken in imitation of the Knights of Mal ta. \"Jachin,\" moreover , scents a Popish plot: They not onl y admit Turks, Jew s, Infid els, but even Jacobites, non-j urors and Papists themselves ... how can we be sure that those Per sons who are known to be well affected, are let into al l their Mysteries? They make no scruple to acknowledge that th ere is a Distinc tion between Prenti ces and Master Masons and who kno ws whether they may not have an higher Order of Cabalists, who keep the Grand Secret of all entire ly to themselves? 350 Later on in France, the Abbé Pérau publ ished his satires on F reemasonr y, Le Secr et des Francs-Maçons (1742), L'Ordre des Francs-Maçons trahi et le Secr et des Mop ses révél é , (1745), and Les Francs-Maçons écrasés (1746) 351 and in about 1761 another English writer said to be a Mason brought down a torrent of invect ive on his head by the publi cation of the ritual of the Craft Degrees under th e name of Jachin and Boaz . 352 It must be ad mitted that from all this controvers y no part y emerges in a ver y chari table light, Catho lics and Protestants al ike indu lging in sarcasms and reckl ess accusations against Free masonr y, the Free masons retorting with far fro m brotherl y forbearance. 353 But, again, one must remember th at all these men were of their age- -an age which seen through the e yes of Hogarth would certa inly not appear to have been distinguished for delicacy. It should be noted, however , when one reads in m asoni c work s of th e \"persecu tions\" to which Freemasonr y has been subjected, that aggres sion was not confin ed onl y to the one side in the conflic t; moreover , that the Free masons at this period were div ided a mongst themselves and expressed with regard to oppo sing group s much the same suspicions tha t non-Mason s expressed with regard to the Order as a whole.

On this foundat ion were ere cted, somewhere between 1740 and 1743, the degre e of the Royal Arch and the first of the series of upper degrees now kno wn as the Scottish Rite or as the Ancien t and Accepted Rite. The accept ance or re jection of th is superstruc ture has always form ed a subject of violent controvers y between Masons, one bod y affirming tha t Craft Masonry is the only true and genuine Masonr y, the other declar ing tha t the real object of Ma sonry is onl y to be found in the high er degrees. It was this controvers y, centring round the Ro yal Arch degre e, that about the m iddle of the eight eenth centur y split Masonr y into opposing camps of Ancien ts and Moderns, the Ancients decl aring th at the R.A. wa s \"the Root, Heart, and Marrow of F reemasonr y,\" 354 the Moderns rejecting it.

F REEMASONR Y IN F RANCE The foundation of G rand Lodge in London had been followed b y the inaugurat ion of Masonic Lodg es on the Contin ent--in 1721 at Mons, in 1725 in Paris, in 1728 at Madrid, in 1731 at The Hague, in 1733 at Hambur g, etc. Several of these receiv ed the ir warrant from the Grand Lodge of England. But this was not the case with the Grand Lodge of Paris, which did not rece ive a warrant ti ll 1743. The men who founded this lodge, far fro m being non-pol itical, were Jacobite leaders engag ed in ac tive schem es for the restoration of the Stuart d ynasty. The leader of the group, Charl es Radclif fe, had been imprisoned with his brother , the ill-fated Lord Derwentwater who wa s execu ted on Tower Hill in 1716. Charles had succeeded in escap ing fro m Newgate and m ade his wa y to France, where he assum ed the title of Lord Derwentwate r, although the Earldo m had ceased to exist under the bill of atta inder against his brothe r. 361 It was this Lord Derwentwat er--afterwards execu ted for tak ing part in the 1745 rebe llion- -who with several oth er Jacobit es is said to have founded the Grand Lodge of Paris in 1725, and hi mself to have beco me Grand Master . The Jacobite charac ter of th e Paris lodge is not a m atter of dispute. Mr . Gould rel ates th at \"the colleagues of Lord Derwentwat er are stated to have been a Cheval ier Maskel ine, a Squire Heguert y, and others, all partisans of the Stuarts.\" 362 But he goes on to contest th e theor y that they used Free masonr y in the Stuart cause, which he regards as a moun ting to a charge of bad fai th. This is surel y unreasonable. The founders of Grand Lodge in Paris did not derive from Grand Lodge in London, fro m which they held no warrant, 363 but, as we have seen, took the ir Free masonr y with the m to France before Grand Lodge of London was insti tuted; they were therefore in no wa y bound b y its regulat ions. And until the Constitut ions of Anderson were published in 1723 no rule had been la id down that the Lodges should be non-polit ical. In the old da ys Freem asonr y had alwa ys been Ro yalist, as we see fro m the anc ient charges that members should be \"true l iegemen of the King\"; and if the adher ents of Ja mes Edward saw in him their rightfu l sovereign, they may have conceived that they were using Free masonr y for a lawful purpo se in adapt ing it to his cause. So although we m ay applaud the dec ision of the London Free masons to purge Freemasonr y of polit ical tenden cies and transform it into a harm onious s ystem of brotherhood, we cannot accuse the Jacobites in France of bad faith in not confor ming to a decision in which they had taken no part and in establishing lodges on their own lines. Unfortunat ely, however , as too frequen tly happens when m en form secre t confeder acies for a wholly honourable purpo se, their rank s were penetra ted by confed erates of another kind. It has been said in an ear lier chapter that, according to the docum ents produced by the Ordre du Temple in the ear ly part of the nine teenth centur y, the Templars had never ceased to exist in spite of their official suppres sion in 1312, and tha t a line of Grand Masters had succe eded ea ch other in unbroken succession fro m Jacques du M olay to the"},{"pageNumber":96,"pageContent":"Duc de Cossé-Brissac, who wa s killed in 1792.

But evidence points to a contr ary conclusion. M. Matter , who, as we have seen, disbeliev es the stor y of th e Ordre du Temple and the authent icity of the Charter of L armenius in so far as it professes to be a genuin e fourteen th-cen tury docu ment, never theless asserts tha t the savants who have examined it dec lare it to date from the ear ly part of the e ighteen th cen tury, at which period Matter believ es the Gospel of St. John used b y the Order to have been arranged so as \"to acco mpan y the cer emoni es of s ome masonic or secret society.\" Now, it was about 1740 tha t a rev ival of Templarism took plac e in France and Ger many; we cannot therefore doubt that if Matter is right in this h ypothesis, the secret society in question was that of the Templars, whether they exist ed as lin eal descendants of the twelfth- centur y Order or m erely as a revival of that Order. The exist ence of the Ger man Templars at this date under the name of the Stricte Observance (which we shal l deal with in a further chapter) is inde ed a fac t disputed by no one; but that there was also an Ordre du Temple in France at the ver y beginning of th e eight eenth centur y must be regarded as highl y probabl e. Dr. Macke y, John Yarker , and Lecout eulx de Cantel eu (who, o wing to his posses sion of Templar docu ments, had exc lusive sources of infor mation) all declar e this to have been the case and accep t the Charter of Lar menius as authent ic. \"It is quite certain,\" says Yarker , \"tha t there was at this per iod in France an Ordre du Temple , with a charter fro m John Mark Lar menius, who cla imed appoint ment from Jacques du Mola y. Philippe of Orléans ac cepted the Grand Mastership in 1705 and signed the Statu tes.\" 364 Without, however , necessaril y accep ting the Chart er of Lar menius as authen tic let us examine the probabi lity of this assertion with regard to the Duc d'Orléans. Amongst the Jacobites supporting Lord Derwentwater at the Grand Lodge of Paris wa s a certain Andrew Michael Ram say, known as Cheval ier Ra msay, who wa s born at Ayr near the famous Lodge of Kilwinning, where the Templars are said to have for med their alliance with the m asons in 1314. In 1710 Ra msay was converted to the Rom an Catho lic faith by Fénelon and in 1724 bec ame tutor to the sons of the Pretend er at Rom e. Mr .

It seems probabl e from all accounts tha t Ramsay was a Cheva lier of this Order , but he cannot have been admitted into it by the Duc d'Orléans, for the Grand Ma ster of the Ordre de Saint- Lazare was not the Duc d' Orléans but the Marquis de Dangeau, who, on his death in 1720, was succeeded by the son of the Regent, th e Duc de Chartr es. 365 If, then, Ram say was adm itted to an y Order b y the Regent, it was surel y the Ordre du Temple , of which the Regen t is said to have been the Grand Master at this dat e. Now, the infa mous charac ter of the Duc d' Orléans is a m atter of com mon knowledg e; moreov er, during the Regenc y--that period of i mpiety and m oral dissolution hither to"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"unpara lleled in the histor y of France--the chief of counc il was the Duc de Bourbon, who later pl aced his mis tress the Marquise de Prie and the financ ier Paris Duverne y at the head of af fairs, thus crea ting a scandal of such m agnitude that he was exiled in 1726 through the influ ence of Cardinal Fleur y. This Duc de Bourbon in 1737 is said to have become Grand Master of th e Temple. \"It was thus,\" ob serves de Cante leu, \"tha t these two Grand Masters of the Temple degrad ed the royal author ity and ceasel essly increased hatred against the governm ent.\" It would therefore seem strange that a ma n so upright as Rams ay appears to have been, who had m oreov er but rec ently been conver ted to the Catho lic Church, should have formed a friendship with the dissolute Regen t of France, unles s there had been som e bond betwe en the m. But here we have a possible explana tion--T emplarism. Doubtless during Rams ay's youth at Kilwinn ing m any Templar traditions had co me to his knowledge, and if in France he found hi mself befri ended b y the Grand Master hi mself, what wonder th at he should have enter ed into an al liance which result ed in his adm ission to an Order he had been accusto med to rever e and which, moreover , was represen ted to him as the fons et origo of the m asoni c brotherhood to which he also belonged? It is thus that we find Ra msay in the very year that the Duc de Bourbon is said to have been made Grand Master of the Temple artlessl y writing to Cardinal Fleur y asking hi m to ext end his prote ction to the society of Freemasons in Paris and enc losing a cop y of the speech which he was to de liver on the following day, March 21, 1737. It is in this fa mous oration that for the first ti me we find Freemasonr y traced to the Crusades: At the time of the Crusades in Palestin e many princes, lords, and ci tizens as sociated themselves, and vowed to restore the Temple of the Christ ians in the Holy Land, and to employ themselves in bringing back their archit ecture to its first institu tion. They agreed upon severa l anci ent signs and s ymbolic words drawn from the wel l of relig ion in order to recognize themselves a mongst the hea thens and Saracens. These signs and w ords were only communicated to those who pro mised solemnly, and even sometimes at the foot of the altar, never to revea l them. This sacred prom ise was therefore not an exe crable oath, as it has been ca lled, but a respec table bond to unit e Christi ans of all nationa lities into one confraterni ty. Some time afterwards our Order for med an int imate union with the Knights of St. John of Jerusale m. From that time our Lodges took the na me of Lodges of St. John. 366 This speech of Ra msay's has raised a stor m of controvers y amongst Freem asons because it conta ins a ver y decided hin t of a connex ion between Templarism and Free masonr y. Mr. Tuckett, in the paper referred to above, poin ts out tha t only the Knights of St. John of Jerusale m are here m entioned, 367 but Rams ay distin ctly speaks of \"our O rder\" for ming a union with the Knights of St. J ohn of Jerusale m, and we know that the Templars did eventually form such a union. The fac t that Ramsay does not mention the Templars b y name admits of a ver y plausible explana tion. It must be re membered that, as Mr . Gould has shown, a cop y of the oration was enclosed by Ram say in his lett er to Cardinal Fleur y appealing for ro yal prote ction to be ext ended to Freem asonr y; it is ther efore hardl y likely that he would have procla imed a connexion between the Order he was anxious to present in the m ost favourable light and one which had form erly been suppres sed by King and"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"Pope. Moreover , if the Charter of Lar menius is to be bel ieved, the newl y elected Grand Master of th e Temple was the Duc de Bourbon, who had alre ady incurr ed the Cardinal's disple asure. Obviousl y, therefore, Templar influ ence was kept in the background. This is not to imply bad fai th on the part of Ra msay, who doubtless held th e Order of Templars to be wholl y praiseworth y; but he could not expect the King or Cardin al to share his view, and therefor e held it more prudent to refer to the progeni tors of Freem asonr y under the vague descrip tion of a crusading bod y. Ramsay's well- meant effort m et, however , with no success. Wheth er on accoun t of this unluck y referen ce by which the Cardin al may have det ected Templar influen ce or for som e other reason, the appeal for ro yal prote ction was not only refused, but the new Order , which hi therto Catholi cs had been allowed to en ter, was now prohibited by Royal edict. In the following year, 1738, the Pope, Cle ment XII, issued a bull, In Eminen ti , banning Free masonr y and excommunicating Cathol ics who took part in it. But this prohibit ion appe ars to have been without effect, for F reemasonr y not onl y prospered but soon began to m anufacture new degrees. And in the m asoni c literatur e of the following thirty years the Templar trad ition beco mes sti ll more clearly appar ent. Thus the Cheval ier de Bérage in a well-known pa mphlet, of w hich the first edition is said to have appeared in 1747, 368 gives the following ac count of the origins of Free masonr y: This Order was insti tuted by Godefroi de Bouil lon in Pal estine in 1330, 369 after the decadence of the Christ ian ar mies, and was onl y communicated to the French Masons some time after and to a ver y small numb er, as a reward for the oblig ing servic es the y render ed to severa l of our Engl ish and Scott ish K nights, from whom true Masonry is taken. Their Metropoli tan Lodge is situat ed on the Mounta in of Heredo m where the first Lodge was held in Europe and which ex ists in all its splendour . The Genera l Council is still held there and it is the seal of the Sovereign Grand Ma ster in of fice. This m ounta in is situated be tween the West and North of Scotland at sixt y miles fro m Edinbur gh. Apart from the histor ical confusion of the first sentenc e, this passage is of interest as evidence that the theor y of a connexion between certain crusading Knights and the Lodge of Heredo m of Kilwinning was current as earl y as 1747. The Baron Tschoud y in his Étoile Flamboyant e , which appeared in 1766, sa ys that the crusading orig in of Freemasonr y is the one officially taugh t in the lodges, where candidat es for init iation are told that several Knights who had set forth to rescue the hol y places of Palestine from the Sarac ens \"form ed an associa tion under the na me of Free Masons, thus indica ting that their princ ipal desire was the reconstru ction of the Temple of Solo mon,\" that, further , they adopted certa in signs, grips, and pass words as a defenc e against the Saracens, and finally that \"our Soci ety ... frat ernized on the footing of an Order with the Knights of St. John of Jerusale m, from which it is apparen t that the Freemasons borro wed the custo m of regard ing St. John as the patron of the whole Order in genera l.\" 370 After th e crusades \"the Masons kept the ir rites and me thods and in this wa y perpe tuated the royal art by estab lishing lodg es, first in Eng land, then in Scotl and,\" etc. 371 In this account, therefore, Freem asonr y is represen ted as having been insti tuted for the defen ce of Christi an doctr ines. De Bérage expresse s the sam e view and expla ins that the"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"object of these Crusaders in thus binding themselves togeth er was to protec t their lives against the Saracens b y envelop ing the ir sacred doctrines in a veil of m ystery. For this purpose the y made use of Jewish s ymbolism, which the y invested with a Christian meaning. Thus the Temple of Solomon was u sed to denote the Church of Christ, the bough of ac acia signified the Cross, the square and the co mpass the union betwe en the Old and New Testaments, etc. So \"the mysteries of Ma sonry were in their princip le, and are still, nothing e lse than those of the Christ ian rel igion.\" 372 Baron Tschoud y, however , declares that all th is stop s short of th e truth, that Freemasonr y origin ated long before the Crusades in Palest ine, and that the rea l \"ancestors, fathers, authors of the Mason s, those illustrious men of whom I will not sa y the date nor betra y the secret,\" were a \"discipl ined body\" whom Tschoud y describes by the na me of \"the Knights of the Aurora and Pal estine.\" After \"the almost total destruct ion of the Jewish peopl e\" these \"Knights\" had alwa ys hoped to regain posses sion of the do mains of their fathers and to rebui ld the Temple, and the y carefull y preserved the ir \"regul ations and particular liturgy,\" togeth er with a \"sublime treat ise\" which was the object of their continual study and of their philosophic al specul ations. Tschoud y further relat es that they were studen ts of the \"occu lt scien ces,\" of which al chemy form ed a part, and th at the y had \"abjured the princip les of the Jewish rel igion in order to follow the ligh ts of the Christ ian faith.\" At the ti me of th e Crusades the Knights of Pal estine came out fro m the desert of the Thebaïd, where they had rem ained hidden, and joined to the mselves so me of the crusaders who had re mained in Jerusale m. Declaring that they were the descendan ts of the masons w ho had worked on the Temple of Solom on, th ey professed to concern themselves with \"specu lative arch itecure,\" which served to disguise a more glorious poin t of view . From this ti me they took the name of Free Mason s, presented themselves under this title to the crusading armies and assembled under their banners. 373 It would of course be absurd to regard any of the foregoing accoun ts as historic al fac ts; the import ant poin t is tha t they tend to prove the fal lacy of supposing th at the Johannite- Templar theor y origina ted with the reviv ed Ordre du Temple , since one corresponding to it so closel y was current in the middle of the preceding centur y. It is true that in these earlier accounts th e actu al words \" Johann ite\" and \"T emplar\" do not occur , but the resemblance between the sect of Je ws professing the Christ ian fai th but possessing a \"particular liturgy\" and a \"subli me treatise\"- -apparent ly some early form of the Cabal a-- dealing with occult science, and the Mandæans or J ohanni tes with th eir Caba listic \"Book of Adam,\" their Book of John, and their ritual, is at once apparen t. Further , the al lusions to the connex ion between the Knights who had been indoctr inated in the Holy Land and the Scottish lodges coincid es exact ly with the Templar tradi tion, published not only by the Ordre du Temple but handed down in the Royal Order of Scotl and. From all this the following facts stand out: (1) tha t whilst British Craft Masonry traced its origin to the operat ive guilds of masons, the Free masons of France from 1737 onwards placed the origin of the Order in crusading chiva lry; (2) th at it was am ongst these Freemasons th at the upper degrees known as the Scottish Ri te arose; and (3) tha t, as we shall now s ee, these degrees clear ly suggest Templar inspirat ion."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"The earli est for m of the upper degre es appears to have been the one given by de Bérage, as follows: 1. Parfai t Maçon É lu. 2. Élu de Perignan. 3. Élu des Quinze. 4. Petit Architecte. 5. Grand Architecte. 6. Cheva lier de l'Épée et de Rose-Croix. 7. Noachi te ou Cheva lier Prussien. The first of these to m ake its appear ance is believ ed to have been the one here assigned to the sixth pla ce. This degre e known in m odern Masonry as \"Prince of the Rose-Croix of Heredo m or K night of the Pelican and Eag le\" bec ame the eigh teenth and the most impor tant degree in what was later called the Scottish Rite, or at the present ti me in England the Ancien t and Accepted Rite. Why was this Ri te called Scottish? \"It cannot be too strongl y insisted on,\" sa ys Mr. Gould, \"tha t all Scott ish Ma sonry has nothing whatever to do with the Grand Lodge of Scotl and, nor , with one pos sible excep tion--that of the Ro yal Order of Scotland- -did it ever origina te in that countr y.\" 374 But in th e case of th e Rose-Croix degre e there is surel y some justific ation for the ter m in legend, if not in proven fact, for, as we have alre ady seen, ac cording to the tr adition of the Royal Order of Scotl and this degre e had been contained in it since the fourteenth centur y, when the degre es of H.R. M. (Heredo m) and R.S.Y .C.S. (Ros y Cross) are said to have been insti tuted by Robert Bruce in coll aborat ion with the Templars after the bat tle of Bannockburn. Dr . Macke y is one of the few Masons who ad mit this probable af filiation, and in referring to the tradit ion of the Royal Order of Scotl and observes: \"Fro m that Order it seem s to us b y no m eans improbabl e that the present degree of Ro se-Croix de Heredo m may have taken i ts origin.\" 375 But the Rose-Croix degre e, like the Templar tradit ion fro m which it appe ars to have descended, is capab le of a dual int erpreta tion, or rather of a multiple interpre tation, for no degre e in Masonr y has been subject to so many varia tions. That on the Contin ent it had descended through the Rosicrucians in an al chemical form seems m ore than probab le. It would cer tainly be dif ficult to beli eve th at a degree of R.S.Y .C.S. was im ported from the East and incorpora ted in the Ro yal Order of Scotland in 1314; that b y a mere coinciden ce a man named Christian Rosenkreutz was--accord ing to the Rosicruc ian leg end--born in the same cen tury and tr ansm itted a secret doctr ine he had discovered in the East to the sevent eenth- centur y Brethren of the Rosy Cross; and fin ally, that a degree of the Rose- Croix was founded in circ. 1741 without an y connexion exist ing betwe en these succeed ing m ovements. Ev en if we den y direct affiliation, we must surel y admit a common source of inspira tion producing, if not a cont inuation, at any rate a periodi c reviv al of th e sam e ideas. Dr . Oliver indeed admits affiliation be tween the seventeen th- century fratern ity and the e ighteen th-cen tury degree, and after pointing out tha t the first indication of the Rose-Croix degree appears in th e Fama Fraterni tatis in 1613, goes on to say:"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"It was known mu ch sooner , although not probabl y as a degree in Masonry, for it existed as a cab alistic scien ce fro m the ear liest times in Eg ypt, Greece, and Rom e, as well as amongst the Jews and Moor s in times more recen t, and in our o wn coun try the names of Roger Bacon, Fludd, Ashmole, and m any others are found in its list of adepts. 376 Dr. Macke y, quoting this passage, observes that \"Oliver confounds the masonic Rose- Croix with the alche mical Rosicruci ans,\" and proceeds to give an account of the Rose- Croix degree as worked in England and Americ a, which he truly describ es as \"in the strictest sense a Christian degre e.\" 377 But the point Dr . Macke y overlooks is tha t this is only one version of the degree, which, as we s hall see la ter, has been and stil l is worked in a ver y differen t manner on the Continent. It is, ho wever , certain tha t the version of the Rose-Croix degree first adopted by the Freemasons of France in about 1741 wa s not only so Christian but so Catholi c in character as to have given rise to the bel ief that i t was devised b y the Jesuits in order to count eract the attacks of w hich Cathol icism was the object. 378 In a paper on the Addition al Degrees Mr. J.S. Tucket t writes: There is undeniab le evidence that in their earliest forms the Ecossais or Scots D egrees were Ro man Cathol ic; I have a MS. Ritua l in French of what I bel ieve to be the original Chev . de l'Aigle or S ∴ P ∴ D ∴ R ∴ C ∴ (Souverain Prince de Rose-Croix) and in it the New Law is decl ared to be \"la foy Catholiqu e,\" and the Baron Tschoud y in his L'Étoile Flamboyan te of 1766 describ es the sa me Degree as \"le Catholi cisme mis en grade\" (Vol. I. p. 1 14). I sugge st that Ecossais or Scots Ma sonry was intend ed to be a Ro man Catholi c as well as a Stuart form of Free masonr y, in which none but those devoted to both Restora tions were to be adm itted. 379 But is it nec essary to read th is polit ical inten tion into the degree? If the trad ition of the Royal Order of Scotland is to be bel ieved, the ide a of the Rose-Croix degree was far older than th e Stuart cause, and dat ed back to Bannockburn, when th e degree of Heredom with which it was coupled was institut ed in order \"to correc t the errors and reform the abuses which had crept in among the three degrees of St. John' s Masonr y,\" and to provide a \"Christiani zed for m of the Third Degree,\" \"purified of the dross of paganis m and even of Judais m.\" 380 Wheth er the antiqui ty attribut ed to th ese degrees can be proved or not, it certainly appears probab le tha t the legend of the Ro yal Order of Scotland had som e foundat ion in fact, and therefore that the ide as em bodied in the eighte enth- centur y Rose- Croix degree m ay have been drawn from the store of that Order and brought b y the Jacobi tes to France. At the same time there is no ev idence in support of the state ment made by certain Continent al writers that Rams ay actually institu ted th is or an y of the upper degrees. On the contr ary, in his O ration he expressl y states that Free masonr y is composed of the Craft degrees onl y: We have amongst us three kinds of brothers: Novices or Apprentices, Fellows or Professed Brothers, Masters or Perfect ed Brethren. To the first are expla ined the moral virtues; to the second the heroic virtues; to the last the Christian virtues...."},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"It might be said then that the Rose-Croix degre e was here foreshadowed in the Masters' degre e, in tha t the latter defin itely inculcated Christi anity. This would be perfe ctly in accord with Ra msay's point of view as set forth in his accoun t of his conversion by Fénelon. When he first met the Archbishop of Cam brai in 1710, Ra msay relates that he had lost faith in all Christian sects and had resolved to \"t ake refuge in a wise Deis m limited to respect for the Divinit y and for the immutable ideas of pure virtue,\" but that his conversa tion with Fénelon led him to accep t the Cathol ic fai th. And he goes on to show that \"Monsieur de Ca mbrai turned Atheists into Deists, Deists into Christians, and Christi ans into Catholi cs by a sequence of ideas full of enligh tenment and fee ling.\" 381 Might not this be the process which Ra msay aimed at introducing into Free masonr y--the process which in fact does form part of the masonic system in Eng land to- day, where the Atheist must beco me, at least by profes sion, a Deist before he can be admitted to the Craft Degrees, whilst the Rose-Croix degree is reserved solel y for those who profes s the Christi an fai th? Such was undoubtedl y the ide a of the men who introduc ed the Rose- Croix degree in to France; and Ragon, who gives an account of this \"Ancien Rose-Croix Franca is\"--w hich is al most ident ical with the degree now worked in England, but long since abandoned in France--objects to it on the very score of its Christian charact er. 382 In this respect the Rose-Croix a mongst all the upper degrees introduc ed to France in the middle of the eigh teenth centur y stands alone, and it alon e can with an y probabi lity be attribut ed to Scot tish Jacobit e inspira tion. It was not, in fact, until three or four y ears after Lord Derwentwa ter or his m ysterious successor Lord Harnouester 383 had resigned the Grand Mastership in favour of the Duc d'Antin in 1738 that the addi tional degrees were first heard of, and i t was not until eight years after the Stuar t cause had receiv ed its dea th- blow at Culloden, that is to sa y, in 1754, th at the Rite of Perfect ion in which the so-cal led Scots Degrees were incorporated was dra wn up in the fol lowing for m: R ITE OF P ERFECT ION 1.

What else is this but Templaris m? Even Mr. Gould, usuall y so reticent on Templar influenc e, admits it at this period: In France ... some of the Scots lodges would appear to have ver y early manufactur ed new degre es, connect ing these very distinguished Scots Ma sons with the Knights Templar, and thus given rise to th e sub sequen t flood of Templarism. The earl iest of a ll are suppo sed to have been the Masons of L yons who inven ted the Kadosch degree, representing the venge ance of the Templars, in 1741. From that time new rit es mu ltiplied in France and Germany, but al l those of French origin cont ain Knight ly, and almost all, Templar grades. In ever y case the connect ing link was composed of one or m ore Scots degrees. 385 The name Kado sch here mentioned is a Hebrew w ord signif ying \"holy\" or \"consecra ted,\" which in the Caba la is found in conjunction with the Tetragr ammaton. 386 The degree is said to have deve loped fro m that of G rand Elec t, 387 one of the three \"degre es of venge ance\" celebra ting with sanguinar y realism the avenging of the murd er of Hira m. But in its fina l form of K night Kado sch--later to beco me the thirtieth degree of the \"Ancien t and Accepted Scottish Ri te\"--the Hira mic legend was changed into the histor y of the Templars with Jacques du M olay as the victi m. 388 So the reprobat ion of at tack on author ity personif ied by the master-builder beco mes approbat ion of at tack on authorit y in the person of the King of France. The introduc tion of the upper degrees with their polit ical and, la ter on, an ti-Christ ian tendencies thus ma rked a complete depar ture from the funda mental princ iple of Freemasonr y that \"nothing conc erning th e relig ion or govern ment shal l ever be spoken of in the lodge.\" For this reason the y have been assailed not only by anti- masonic writers but by Freemasons the mselv es. 389 To represent Barruel and Robison as the ene mies of Freemasonr y is therefore absolute ly false; neith er of these men denounced Craft Masonr y as prac tised in England, but onl y the superstruc ture erected on the Cont inent. Barruel indeed incurs the reproaches of M ounier for his cha mpionship of Engl ish Freemasons: He vaunts th eir respec t for rel igious opinion and for authori ty. When he speaks of Freemasons in general they are impious, rebell ious s uccessor s of the Templars and Albigenses, but all those of England are innoc ent .

Rebold, who gives a l ist of these writers, quotes a m asoni c publi cation, authori zed b y the Grand Orient and the Supreme Counci l of France, in which it is said tha t \"fro m all these rites there result the m ost foolish concep tions, ... the most absurd legends, ... the most extravagant systems, the m ost immoral princ iples, and those the most dangerous for the peace and preserva tion of States,\" and th at ther efore exc ept the first thr ee degre es of Masonr y, which are reall y ancient and universal, ever ything is \"chi mera, extrav agance, futility, and l ies.\" 391 Did Barrue l and Robison ever use stronger languag e than this? To attribute the perversion of Masonr y to Jacobit e influen ce would be absurd. H ow could it be supposed that either Ram say or Lord Derwentwa ter (who died as a devout Catho lic on the scaffold in 1746) could have been concern ed in an attempt to underm ine the Catho lic faith or the m onarchy of France? I w ould suggest, then, tha t the term \"Scots Masonr y\" beca me simply a vei l for Templarism--Templarism, moreover , of a ver y differen t kind to that from which th e origina l degre e of the Rose-Croix wa s derived. It was this so-cal led Scots Masonr y that, after the resigna tion of Lord Derwentwa ter, \"boldl y came forward and cl aimed to be not me rely a part of Ma sonry but the rea l Masonr y, possessed of superior knowledge and ent itled to grea ter priv ileges and the righ t to rule over th e ordinar y, i.e. Craft Masonr y.\" 392 The Grand Lodge of France seems, however , to have rea lized the danger of subm itting to the do mination of the Templar element, and on the death of the Duc d'Antin and his rep lacement by the Co mte de Clermont in 1743, signified its adheren ce to English Craft Masonr y by proclai ming itself Grande Log e Anglaise de France and reissued th e \"Constitu tions\" of Anderson, first published in 1723, with the injunction that the Scots Masters should be pla ced on th e same level as the si mple Appren tices and Fellow Crafts and allowed to wear no badges of distin ction. 393 Grand Lodge of England appears to have been reassured by this procla mation as to the character of French Free masonr y, for now , in 1743, it at last deliver ed a warrant to Grand Lodge of France. Yet in reali ty it was from this mo ment that French Free masonr y degen erated the m ost rapidl y. The Order was s oon invad ed by intriguers.

In 1761 a Jew nam ed Stephen Morin was sent to America by the \"Em perors\" ar med with a warran t from the Duc de Cler mont and Grand Lodge of Paris and bearing th e sonorou s title of \"Grand El ect Perfect and Subli me Master,\" with orders to establish a Lodge in that countr y.

Under the Grand Mastership of the Regent and his successor the Duc de Bourbon, the revolu tionar y elements a mongst the Templars had had full play, but fro m 1741 onwards the Grand Masters of the Order were supporters of the monarchy. When the Revolu tion ca me, the Duc de Cossé-Bris sac, who had been Grand Master since 1776, perished a mongst the defenders of the throne. It was thus tha t by the middle of the centur y the Order of th e Temple ceased to be a revolu tionar y force, and the discont ented elements it had conta ined, no long er able to find in it a refuge, threw themselves in to Free masonr y, and enter ing the higher degre es turned the m to their subversive purpose. According to Papu s, Lacorne was a m ember of the Templar group, and the dissensions that took plac e were princ ipally a fight between the ex- Templars and the genuine Freemasons which ended in the triumph of the for mer: Victorious rebels thus founded th e Grand Orient of France. So a conte mporar y Mason is able to writ e: \"It is not excessive to sa y that the m asonic revolu tion of 1773 w as the prelud e and the precursor of the Revolution of 1789.\" What must be well observed is the secre t action of the Brothers of the Templar Ri te.

G ERMAN T EMPLARI SM AND F RENC H I LLUM INIS M The year after Ra msay's oration- -that is to sa y in 1738--Frederi ck, Crown Prince of Prussia, the future Frederick the Great, who for two y ears had been carrying on a correspondenc e with Voltair e, suddenl y evinced a curiosit y to know the secrets of Freemasonr y which he had hitherto derided as \"Kinderspi el,\" and according ly went through a hast y initiation during the night of August 14-15, whilst passing through Brunswick. 397 The ceremony took pla ce not at a m asonic lodge, but at a hotel, in the presence of a deput ation summoned b y the Graf von Lippe- Bückebur g from Grand Lodge of Ham burg for the occasion. It is eviden t that som ething of an unusual kind must have occurred to necessitate these speed y and ma keshift arrange ments. Carl yle, in his account of the episode, endeavours to pass it off as a \"ver y trifling cir cumstan ce\"--a reason the m ore for regard ing it as of the highest import ance since we know no w fro m facts tha t have recently come to light how carefull y Carlyle was s poon-fed by Potsda m whilst writing his book on Frederi ck the Great. 398 But let us follow Freder ick's mason ic career . In June 1740, after his accession to the throne, his inter est in Masonr y had cl early not waned, for we find hi m presiding over a lodge at Char lottenbur g, where he rece ived into the Order two of his brothers, his brother -in-law, and Duke Frederi ck William of Holstein- Beck. At his desire the Baron de Bielfeld and his priv y counc illor Jordan founded a lodge at Ber lin, the \"Three Globes,\" which by 1746 had no less than fourte en lodges under its jurisdic tion. In this same year of 1740 Voltair e, in response to urgent invi tations, paid his first visit to Frederi ck the Great in Germany. Voltaire is usually said not to have yet beco me a Mason, and the date of his init iation is supposed to have been 1778, when he was receiv ed into the Loge des Neuf Soeurs in Paris. But th is by no me ans prec ludes the possibil ity that he had belonged to another mason ic Order at an earl ier date. At an y rate, Voltaire's visit to Germany was followed b y two re mark able events in th e masonic world of France. The first of these was the insti tution of the addition al degre es; the second--perhaps not wholl y unconne cted with the first--wa s the arriva l in Paris of a ma sonic delega te fro m Germ any named von Marschall, who brought with hi m instruct ions for a new or rather a revived"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Order of Templarism , in which he at tempted to interest Prince Charl es Edward and his followers. Von Marschal l was followed about two y ears later by Baron von H unt, who had been initiated in 1741 into th e three degrees of Craft Masonry in Germ any and now came to consecra te a lodge in Paris. According to von Hundt' s own accoun t, he was then rec eived into the Order of th e Temple by an unknown K night of the Red Plum e, in the presence of Lord Kilm arnock, 399 and was presented as a distingu ished Brother to Prince Char les Edward, whom he im agined to be Grand Ma ster of the Order. 400 But all this wa s afterwards s hown to be a pure frabric ation, for Prince Char les Edward dened all knowledge of the af fair, and von Hundt hi mself ad mitted later tha t he did not know the name of the lodge or chap ter in which he was receiv ed, but th at he was dire cted from \"a hidden centre\" and b y Unknown S uperiors, whose iden tity he was bound not to revea l. 401 In rea lity it appe ars that von H undt's accoun t was exact ly the oppo site of the truth, 402 and that it was von Hundt who, seconding von Mar schall's ef fort, tri ed to enrol Prince Charles Edward in the new Ger man Order b y assuring him that he could raise powerful support for the Stuart cause under the cover of reor ganizing the Templar Order , of which he claimed to posses s the true secre ts handed down fro m the Knights of the fourteenth century. By way of further rehabil itating the Order , von Hundt dec lared that a ll the accusations brought against i t by Philipp e le Bel and the Pope were based on fa lse charges manufactur ed by two recre ant Knights named Nof fodei and Florian as a revenge for having been depriv ed of the ir commands b y the Order in consequence of certa in crimes the y had co mmitted. 403 According to Lecou teulx de Cante leu, von Hundt eventually succeeded- -after the defe at of Cul loden--in persuading Prince Charles Edward to enter his Order . But this is ex tremely doubtful. At an y rate, when in 1751 von H undt officially founded his new Templar Order under the name of the Stricte Observance , the unfortuna te Char les Edward pla yed no part at all in th e sche me. As Mr . Gould has trul y observed, \"no tr ace of Jacobite intrigues ever blended with the teach ing of the Stricte Observance .\" 404 The Order of the Stricte Observance was in reali ty a pure ly Germ an associa tion composed of me n drawn ent irely from the intel lectual and aristocr atic classes, and, in imitation of the chiva lric Order s of th e past, known to ea ch other under knightl y titles. Thus Prince Charles of Hesse beca me Eques a Leone Resur gente, Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick Eques a Victoria, the Prus sian minister von Bischof fswerder Eques a Gr ypho, Baron de Wachter Eques a Ceraso, Christian Bode (Counci llor of Leg ation in Saxe- Gotha) Eques a Li lio Conval lium, von Haugwitz (Cab inet Minister of Frederi ck the Great) Eques a Monte Sancto, etc. But according to the declara tions of the Order the of ficial leaders, Knights of th e Moon, the Star, the Golden Sun, or of the Sacred Mountain, were sim ply figur e-heads; the real leaders, known as the \"Unknown S uperiors,\" remained in the background, unadorned by titles of chivalr y but exerc ising suprem e jurisdict ion over the Order . The system had been foreshadowed b y the \"Invisibles\" of seventeenth- centur y Rosicrucianism; but now, instead of an in tangibl e group whose ver y existen ce was onl y known vaguel y to the world, ther e appear ed in th e ligh t of da y a powerful organiza tion led apparen tly by men"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"of influ ence and position yet secret ly directed by hidden chi efs. 405 Mirabe au has described the advent of these m ysterious directors in the following passage: In about 1756 there appeared, as if the y had com e out of the ground, me n sent, the y said, by unknown superiors, and ar med with powers to refor m the order [of F reemasonr y] and re-establish i t in its ancien t purit y.

Tucket t attribut e to the so-call ed Scots Mason s, 410 corresponds precisel y with the dec line of Jacobite and the rise of Germ an influ ence. Would i t not th erefore appear probable that, except in the case of the Rose-Croix degree, the authors of the upper degrees were not Scots men nor Jacobit es, that Scots Ma sonry was a ter m used to cover not m erely Templarism but more espec ially Germ an Templarism, and that the rea l author and inspirer of the m ovement was Frederi ck the Great? No, it is significan t to find that in the histor y of th e Ordre du Temple , published at the beginning of th e ninet eenth century, Frederi ck the Great is ci ted as one of the m ost dist inguished m embers of this Order in the past, 411 and the Abbé Grégoire adds tha t he was \"consecra ted\" at Remersber g (Rheinsber g?) in 1738, tha t is to sa y in the sa me year that he was init iated into Masonry at Bruns wick. 412 There is therefore a defin ite reason for connect ing Frederi ck with Templarism at this date. I would suggest, then, that the truth about the Templar succession m ay be found in one of the two following theories: 1. That the docum ents produced by the Ordre du Temple in the ninete enth cen tury, including the Charter of Lar menius, were genuin e; that the Order had never ceased to exist since the days of the Crusades; that the Templar heres y was J ohannis m, but tha t this was not held by the Templars who e scaped to Scotland; that the Rose-Croix degree in its purel y Christian form was introduced by the Scot tish Templars to Scotland and four hundred years later brought b y Ramsay to France; that the Master of the Temple at this date was the Regen t, Philipp e Duc d' Orléans, as stated in the Charter of Lar menius. Final ly, that aft er this, fresh Templar degre es were introduc ed fro m Ger many by von Hundt, ac ting on beha lf of Frederi ck the Great. 2. That the docum ents produced by the Ordre du Temple in the ninete enth cen tury were, as M. Matter declar es, earl y eighteen th-cen tury fabric ations; that although, in view of the tradition preserved in the Ro yal Order of Scotland, there appe ars to be good reason to believe the stor y of the Scottish Templars and the origin of the Rose-Croix degre e, the rest of the histor y of th e Templars, including the Chart er of Lar menius, was an inven tion of the \"Conceal ed Superiors\" of the Stricte Observance in Ger many, and that the most impor tant of these \"Conce aled Superiors\" were Frederick the Great and Voltaire. I shall not at tempt to dec ide which of these two theor ies is correc t; all tha t I do m aintain is tha t in either case the preponderat ing rôle in Templarism at this crisis was pla yed by Frederi ck the Great, probabl y with the co-operat ion of Voltaire, who in his Essai sur les Mæurs champion ed the cause of the Templars. Le t us follow the reasons for arriving at this conclusion."},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Ramsay's orat ion in 1737 conne cting Freem asonr y with the Templars ma y well have come to th e ears of Frederi ck and suggested to him the idea of using Ma sonry as a cover for his intr igues--hence his hast y initiation a t Bruns wick. But in order to acqu ire influence in a secre t societ y it is alwa ys necessar y to estab lish a c laim to superior knowledge, and Templarism seemed to provide a fruitfu l source of inspira tion. For this purpose new ligh t must be thrown on the Order . Now, there was probabl y no one bet ter qualified than Voltaire, with his knowledge of the anc ient and m edieval world and hatred of the Cathol ic Church, to undertak e the construction of a historic al romance subversive of the Cathol ic fai th--henc e the urgent sum mons to the philosopher to visit Freder ick. We can imagine Voltaire delving amongst the records of the past in order to reconstruct the Templar heres y. This wa s clearly Gnostic, and the Mandæans or Christians of St. John may well have appeared to present the requir ed chara cteristics. If i t could be sho wn tha t here in Johannism true \"primitive Christian ity\" was to be found, w hat a blow for the \"infâme\"! A skilful forger could easi ly be found to fabrica te the docu ments said to have been preserved in the secret archives of the Order . Further we find von Marschall arriving in the following year in France to reorganize the Templars, and von Hundt lat er claiming to be in posse ssion of th e true secrets of the Order handed down from the fourteenth century. That some docu ments bearing on this question were eith er discovered or fabricated under the direct ion of Frederi ck the Great seems the more probable fro m the existence of a ma sonic tradit ion to this ef fect. Thus Dr . Oliver quotes a Report of the Grand Inspectors-Genera l in th e ninet eenth centur y stating that: During the Crusades, at which 27,000 M asons were present, so me mason ic MSS. of great impor tance were discovered among the descendan ts of the anc ient Jews, and tha t other valuable docum ents were found at dif feren t periods down to the y ear of Light 5557 (i.e. 1553), at which ti me a record ca me to light in Syrian chara cters, re lating to the most remote antiquity, and fro m which it would appear th at the world is m any thousand y ears older than giv en by the Mosaic account. Few of these chara cters were tr anslated till the reign of our illustr ious and m ost en lighten ed Brother Frederick II, King of P russia, whose well- known zeal for the Craft was the cause of so m uch improve ment in the Socie ty over which he condescended to preside. 413 I suggest, then, that the docu ments here referred to and conta ining th e secrets c laimed by von Hundt m ay have been the ones aft erwards published b y the Ordre du Temple in the nineteenth centur y, and tha t if unauthent ic the y were the work of Voltaire, aided probabl y by a Jew capab le of for ging Syriac manuscr ipts. That Johnson was the Jew in question seems probab le, since Findel def initely asserts tha t the histor y of the continua tion of the Order of Knights Templar was his w ork. 414 Frederick, as w e know , was in the habit of employing Jews to carr y out shad y transact ions, and he m ay well have used John son to forge docu ments as he used Ephra im to coin fa lse mo ney for him . It would be further quite in keeping with his polic y to get rid of the m an as soon as he had served his purpose, lest he should betra y his secrets. At an y rate, whatev er were the methods e mployed by Freder ick th e Great for obtaining contro l over Masonr y, the fruitful results of that \"very trifling circu mstan ce,\" his initiation at Bruns wick, beco me more and mo re apparent as the centur y advances.

The making of the Encyclopéd ie , which even those w riters the most scepti cal with regard to secret inf luences beh ind the revolution ary movement admit to have contribut ed towards the final cataclysm, is a question on which of ficial histor y has thrown but l ittle light. According to the author ized version of the stor y--as rel ated, for exa mple, in Lord Morle y's work on the Enc yclopædists--the plan of tr anslating Ephrai m Chambers's Cyclopædia , which had appeared in 1728, was s uggested to Diderot \"some fifteen years later\" b y a French bookseller named Le Breton. Diderot's \"fertil e and ener getic intelligence transfor med the sche me.... It was resolved to ma ke Cham bers's w ork a m ere starting-point for a new enterpr ise of far wider scope.\" We then go on to read of the finan cial difficulties that now beset the publ isher, of the embarrass ment of Diderot, who \"felt himself unequal to the task of arranging and supervising ever y depart ment of a new book tha t was to inc lude the whole circ le of the scienc es,\" of the fortuna te enlisting of d'Ale mber t as a col labora tor, and l ater of me n belong ing to a ll kinds of professions, \"all united in a work th at was as useful as it was labor ious, without any view of inter est ... without any common understanding and agree ment,\" further , of the crue l persecut ions encoun tered at the hands of the Jesuits, \"who had expec ted at least to have control of the articles on theolog y,\" and final ly of the tyrannical suppression of the great work on account of the anti- Christian tendenc ies these same articles displa yed. 418 Now for a further l ight on th e matter. In the famous speech of the Cheval ier Rams ay already quoted, which was delivered at Grand Lodge of Paris in 1737, the following passage occurs: The fourth qual ity requir ed in our O rder is th e taste for useful scienc es and the libera l arts. Thus, the Order exacts of each of y ou to contribut e, by his protec tion, libera lity, or labou r, to a vast work for w hich no acade my can suffice, because all these societ ies being composed of a ver y small number of me n, the ir work cannot embrace an object so extended. All the Grand Masters in Germ any, England, Ita ly, and elsewhere exhort all the learned m en and al l the artisans of the Fraterni ty to uni te to furnish the m aterials for a Universal Dictionar y of all the liberal arts and useful sciences; except ing onl y theolog y and politi cs. The work has alread y been co mmenced in London, and b y means of the unions of our brothers it may be carri ed to a conclusion in a few y ears. 419 So after all it was no enterpr ising booksell er, no bril liantly inspir ed philosopher , who conceived the ide a of the Encyc lopédi e , but a powerful int ernation al organization able to employ the services of m ore men than all the ac ademies could supply, which devised the scheme at least six y ears before the date at which i t is said to have occurred to Diderot.

Thus, he writes: The Revolut ion m anifests itself by two stages: 1st. Intellectual revolution , by the public ation of the Encyclopéd ie , due to French Freemasonr y under the high inspirat ion of the Duc d'Antin. 2nd. Occult revolution in the Lodges, due in great part to the members of the Templar Rite and exe cuted by a group of expel led Free masons afterwards a mnest ied. 420 The masonic authorship of the Encyc lopédi e and the consequent dissem ination of revolu tionar y doctrines has rem ained no m atter of doubt to the Freemasons of France; on the contrar y, they glory in the fact. At the congres s of the Grand Orient in 1904 the Freemason Bonnet dec lared: In the eight eenth centur y the glorious l ine of Enc yclopædists for med in our te mples a ferven t audien ce which was then alone in invoking the radi ant dev ice as yet unknown to the crowd: \"Lib erty, Equali ty, Fratern ity.\" The revolut ionar y seed quickl y germ inated amidst this élite . Our illustr ious Free masons d' Alembert, Diderot, Helvétius, d'Holbach, Voltaire, Condorcet, completed the evolu tion of m inds and prepared the new era. And, when the Bastil le fel l, Free masonr y had the supreme honour of giving to hu manity the charter (i.e. the Declaration of the Rights of Man) which it had el aborated with devot ion. ( Applause .) This charter , the orator went on to say, was the work of th e Free mason Lafa yette, and wa s adopt ed by the Constituent Assembly, of which more than 300 me mbers were Freemasons. But in using the lodges to so w the seeds of revolut ion, the Encyclopæd ists betra yed not only the cause of mon archy but of Ma sonry as well. It will be noti ced tha t, in conform ity with true m asoni c princip les, Ra msay in his oration expressl y stated that the encyclopædia was to concern itself with the l iberal arts and scien ces 421 and that theolog y and politi cs were to be excluded from the conte mplated schem e. How, then, did it come to pass that these were eventua lly the two sub jects to which the Encyclopædists devoted the greatest attention, so that the ir work beca me princ ipally an at tack on Church and monarchy? If Papus was right in attribu ting th is revolut ionar y tendency to the Encyclopéd ie from the time of the famous oration, then Ra msay could onl y be set down as the profoundest h ypocrite or as the mouthpie ce of h ypocrites professing int entions th e very reverse of their real designs. A far m ore probable explana tion seems to be tha t during the int erval between Ra msay's speech and the date when the Encyc lopédi e was"},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"begun in earnest, the sche me underwent a change. It will be noticed that the y ear of 1746, when Diderot and d' Alembert are said to have e mbarked on their t ask, coincid ed with th e decadence of French Free masonr y under the Co mte de Clerm ont and the invasion of the lodges by the subversive el ements; thus the project propounded with th e best int entions by the Freem asons of 1737 was filched by their revolution ary successors and turned to a diametrically opposite purpose. But it is not to the dancing-m aster La corne and his mi ddle- class following that we can attribut e the efficien cy with which not onl y the Encyclopéd ie but a host of m inor revolu tionar y publica tions were c ircula ted all over France. Frederick the Great had seen his opportuni ty. If I a m right in m y surmise that Rams ay's speech had reach ed the ears of Frederi ck, the prospect of the Encyc lopédi e contained therein may well have appeared to him a magnificen t method for obta ining a footing in the int ellectua l circles of France ; hence then, doubtless, an addi tional reason for his hast y initiation into Masonr y, his summons to Voltair e, and his subsequent overtures to Diderot and d'Alem bert, who, b y the time the first volu me of the Encyc lopédi e appe ared in 1751, had both been made members of the Royal Academ y of Prussia. In the following y ear Frederick offered d'Ale mber t the presidenc y of th e Acade my in place of Maupertuis, an of fer which was refused; but in 1755 and again in 1763 d' Alembert visited Freder ick in Germ any and received his pension regular ly from Berl in. It is therefore not surprising that when the Encyclopéd ie had reach ed the letter P, it inc luded, in an unsigned art icle on Pru ssia, a paneg yric on the virtues and the ta lents of the il lustrious m onarch who presided over the destin ies of tha t favoured countr y. The art of Frederi ck the Great, as of his successors on the throne of the Hohenzol lerns, was to m ake use of ever y movement that could furth er the design of Pru ssian supremacy. He used the Freemasons as he used the philosophers and as he used the Jews, to carr y out his grea t sche me--the destruc tion of the French m onarchy and of the al liance between France and Austria. Whilst through his representa tives at the Court of France he was able to create discord between Versail les and Vienna and bring discred it on Marie Antoine tte, through his alli es in the mason ic lodges and in the secret societies he was able to reach the people of France. The gold and the printing presses of Frederi ck the Great were added to those of the Orléan istes for the circul ation of seditious l iterature throughout the provinc es. 422 So as the centur y advan ced the associat ion founded b y Royalists and Catho lics was turned into an engine of destruction by revolut ionar y intriguers; the rit es and s ymbols were gradua lly perverted to an end direct ly opposed to tha t for which th ey had been instituted, and the two degrees of Rose-Croix and Knight Kadosch ca me to symbolize respec tively war on relig ion and war on the monarch y of France. It is no orthodox Cathol ic but an occul tist and Ro sicrucian who thus de scribes the rôle of Masonr y in the Revolut ion: Masonr y has not onl y been profaned but it has been served as a cover and pretex t for the plots of anarch y, by the occul t influ ence of the aveng ers of Jacques du M olay and the"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"continuers of the schism atic work of the Temple.

F RENCH I LLU MINIS M Whilst Frederick the Great, the Freemasons, the Enc yclopædists, and the Orléan istes were working on th e material plane to under mine the Church and mon archy in France, anoth er cul t had arisen which by the middle of the cen tury succeed ed in insinuating itself into the lodges. This wa s a recrudescenc e of the old craz e for occul tism, which now spread l ike wildf ire al l over Europ e from Bordeaux to St. Petersbur g. During the reign of Anna of Courland (1730-40) the Russian Court was permeated with superstit ion, and professional magicians and char latans of ever y kind were encouraged. The upper cl asses of Ger many in the eighte enth cen tury proved equall y suscept ible to the attra ctions of th e supernatur al, and princes desirous of long l ife or grea ter power eag erly pursued the quest of the Philosopher's Stone, the \"E lixir of Life,\" and evoked spiri ts under the direct ion of occultists in their service. In France occult ism, reduc ed to a system, adopted the outer forms of Ma sonry as a cover to the propaga tion of i ts doctrines. It wa s in 1754 that Martines de Pasqual ly (or Paschal is), a Rose-Croix Mason, 424 founded his O rder of É lus Cohens (Elec ted Priests), known lat er as the Martinistes or the French Illumin és . Although brought up in the Christi an fai th, Pasquall y has been frequent ly describ ed as a Jew . The Baron de Gleichen, himself a Mart iniste and a m ember of the Amis Réunis, 425 throws an int eresting light on the matter in this passage: \"Pasqual is wa s origin ally Spanish, perhaps of the Jewish race, since his disciples inherit ed fro m him a large number of Je wish m anuscr ipts.\" 426 It was \"this Cabalist ic sect,\" 427 the Martinist es, w hich now beca me the third grea t masonic power in France. The rite of the Martin istes was broadl y divid ed into two classes, in the first of which was represen ted the fall of ma n and in the second his final restoration- -a further variat ion on the masonic theme of a loss and a recov ery. After the first three Craft degrees came the Cohen degrees of the same--Apprentic e Cohen, Fel low Craft Cohen, and Ma ster Cohen-- then those of Grand Archi tect, Grand Elec t of Zerubb abel or K night of the East: but above these were conc ealed degrees l eading up to the Rose-Croix, which for med the capston e of the edific e. 428 Pasqually first established his rite at Marseil les, Toulouse, and Bordeaux, then in Paris, and before long Martiniste lodges spread al l over France with the centre at Lyons under the dire ction of Willermoz, a prosperous me rchant living there.

The ri tual of \"the eminent Order of the Knights of the Bl ack Eag le or Sovere igns of the Rose- Croix,\" a secret and unpublished docu ment of the eigh teenth centur y, which dif fers entirely from the published ritu als, expl ains that no one can attain to knowledg e of the higher sciences without the \"Clavicu les de Salo mon,\" of which the real secrets were never committed to print and which is said to conta in the whole of Cabal istic science. 430 The catechism of th is sam e degre e deals mainly with the transm utation of me tals, the Philosopher's Stone, et c. In the Rite of Perfection as worked in France and America this Cabalist ic inf luence is shown in those degrees known under the na me of the \"Inef fable Degrees,\" derived fro m the Jewish be lief in the mystery that surround s the Ineflab le Na me of God. According to the custom of th e Jew s, the sacred na me Jehovah or Jah-ve, co mposed of the four lett ers yod, he, vau, he, which for med the Tetragr ammaton, was never to be pronounced by the profane, who were obliged to sub stitute for it th e word \" Adonai.\" The Tetragr ammaton might only be utter ed once a year on the Day of Atone ment by the High Priest in the Hol y of Holies amid the sound of trum pets and c ymbals, which prevent ed the people fro m hearing it. It is said tha t in consequence of the people thus refrain ing fro m its utteran ce, the true pronunc iation of the name was at last lost. The Jews further believ ed that the Tetragr ammaton was pos sessed of unbounded powers. \"He who pronounces it shakes heaven and ear th and inspires the ver y ange ls with astonish ment and terror .\" 431 The Ineffable Name thus conferred m iraculous gifts; it was engraved on the rod of Mo ses and enabled hi m to perfor m wonders, j ust as, according to the Toledot Yeshu, it conferr ed the same powers on Christ. This supersti tion was cle arly a part of Rosicruc ian trad ition, for the symbol of the Tetragr ammaton with in a tr iangle, adopted by the m asoni c lodges, figures in Fludd' s Caba listic system. 432 In the \"Inef fable degre es\" it was invested with al l the mystic awe by which it is surrounded in Jewish theolog y, and, ac cording to early Americ an working: \"Brothers and Com panions of these degrees rec eived the na me of God as it was reveal ed to Enoch and were sworn to pronounce it but once in their lives.\" In the alche mical version of the Rose-Croix degree referr ed to above the Inef fable Na me is actually invested with m agical powers a s in the Jewish Cabal a.

What is the m ost powerful name of G od on the pentacu lum? A. Adonai. Q. What is its power ? A. To mov e the Universe. That one of the Knights who had the good fortun e to pronounce it cabalist ically would have at his disposal the powers that inhabit the four ele ments and the celest ial spirits, and would posses s all the virtues possible to ma n. 433 That this for m of the Rose-Croix was of purel y Jewish orig in is thus cle arly evident. In the address to the candida te for ini tiation into the Rose-Croix degree at the Lodge of the \"Contra t Socia l\" it is stated: This degree, which includes an Order of Perfect Masons, wa s brought to light by Brother R., who took it from the Kabbalist ic tre asure of the Doctor and Rabbi Néam uth, chief of the synagogu e of Le yden in Holland, who had preserved its prec ious secrets and its costu me, both of which we s hall see in the sa me order in which he placed them in his mysterious Talmud. 434 Now, we kno w tha t in the eigh teenth centur y a societ y of Rosicrucian magicians had been instituted in Florenc e which was beli eved to date back to the fifteenth cen tury and to have been partl y, if not wholly composed of Orient als, as we shall see in the next chap ter; but it seem s probable that this sect, whilst secret ly inspiring the Rose-Croix masons, was itself either na meless or conce aled under a disguise. Thus in 1782 an English Free mason writes: \"I have found so me rather cur ious M SS. in Algiers in Hebrew rela ting to the socie ty of the Rosicrucians, which exists at present under anoth er name with the same forms. I hope, moreover to be ad mitted to the ir knowledge.\" 435 It has frequentl y been ar gued that Jews can have played no part in Free masonr y at this period since the y themselves were not admitted to the lodges. But this is b y no m eans certain; in the article from The Gentl eman's Magazine already quoted it is stated th at Jews are ad mitted; de Lu chet further quotes th e instanc e of David Moses Hertz rece ived in a London lodge in 1787; and the author of Les Franc- Masons écrasés , published in 1746, stat es that he has seen three Jews rece ived in to a lodge at Amst erdam. In the \"Melch isedeck Lodges\" of the Cont inent non-Christians were openl y admitted, and here again the Rose-Croix degree occupies th e most important place. The highest degrees of this rite were the Init iated Brothers of Asia, the Masters of the Wise, and the Royal Priests, otherwise known as the degree of Melchisedeck or the true Brothers of the Rose- Croix."},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"This Order, usually described as the Asiatic Brethren , of which the centr e was in Vienna and the lead er a cer tain Baron von Eckhof fen, is said to have been a continua tion of th e \"Brothers of the Golden and Rosy Cross,\" a reviva l of the seventeenth- centur y Rosicruc ians or ganized in 1710 b y a Saxon priest, Sa muel Richt er, known as Sincerus Rena tus. The real origins of the Asiati c Brethren are, however , obscure and li ttle literatur e on the subject is to be found in this countr y. 436 Their further title of \"the Knights and Brethr en of St. John the Ev angelist\" suggests J ohanni te inspira tion and wa s clearly an impostur e, since they included Jews, Turks, Persians, and Armenians. De Luch et, who as a conte mporar y was in a position to acquir e first- hand inform ation, thus describ es the organiz ation of the Order , which, it wil l be seen, was ent irely Judaic. \"The superior direction is call ed the small and constant Sanhedri m of Europe.

That is the grea t and insidious question for the secret societies. But the Initia te who re mains, and m ust re main eternally in the Order , never finds this out, he dare not even ask it, he must prom ise never to ask it. In this way those who part icipate in the secrets of the Order remain the Masters.\" Again, as in the Stricte Observance , the same system of \"Concealed Superiors\"--the same blind obedien ce to unkno wn dire ctors! Under the guidance of these various sects of Illu minés a wave of occu ltism swept over France, and lodges ever ywhere beca me cen tres of instruct ion on the Cabala, magic, divin ation, alche my, and theosoph y 438 ; mason ic rites degener ated into cer emonies for the evocation of spirits--wom en, who were now adm itted to these asse mblies, screa med, fainted, fe ll into convulsions, and lent th emselves to experi ments of the most horribl e kind. 439 By means of these occu lt prac tices the Illumin és in time bec ame the third great masonic power in France, and the rival Orders perc eived the exped iency of joining forces. According ly in 1771 an amalgamation of al l the masonic group s was ef fected at the new lodge of the Amis Réun is . The founder of this lodge was Savalet te de Langes, Keeper of th e Royal Treasur y, Grand Officer of the Grand Orient, and a high initiate of Ma sonry--\"versed in all mysteries, in all the lodges, and in all the plots.\" In order to unite them he m ade his lodge a mixture of all sophistic, Martiniste, and m asoni c systems, \"and as a bai t to the aristo cracy organized balls and concer ts at which the adep ts, ma le and fe male, danced and feasted, or sang of the beaut ies of their liber ty and equa lity, little knowing that above the m was a secret"},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"committee which was arranging to extend this equal ity beyond the lodge to rank and fortune, to cast les and to cottages, to m arquesses and bour geois\" al ike. 440 A further develop ment of the Amis Réunis was the Rit e of the Philalèthes , com pounded by Saval ette de Lang es in 1773 out of Swedenbor gian, Martiniste, and Rosicruc ian mysteries, into which the higher ini tiates of the Amis Réunis--Court de Gebelin, the Prince de Hes se, Condorcet, th e Vicomte de Tavannes, Willermoz, and oth ers--were initiated. A modified for m of this rite was inst ituted at Narbonne in 1780 under the name of \"Free and Accept ed Mason s du Ri t Primitif,\" the Engl ish nom enclature being adopt ed (according to Clavel) in order to make it appe ar that the rite e manated fro m Eng land. In reality its founder , the Marquis de Chefdeb ien d'Arm isson, a m ember of the Grand Orient and of the Amis Réunis, drew his inspiration from certain Germ an Free masons with whom he maintained throughout close relat ions and who were presum ably members of the Strict e Observan ce, since Chefdebi en was a me mber of this Order , in which he bore the title of \"Equ es a Capit e Galea to.\" The correspondence th at passed between Chefdeb ien and Salvale tte de Langes, rec ently discovered and published in France, is one of the most illuminating records of the mason ic ramifications in existenc e before the Revolu tion ever brought to light. 441 To judge by the tone of these le tters, th e lead ers of the Rit Prim itif would appe ar to have been l aw-abiding and lo yal gentle men devoted to the Catho lic relig ion, y et in their passion for new forms of Ma sonry and thirst for occu lt lore ready to associat e themselves with every kind of adven turer and charla tan who m ight be able to in itiate them into further mysteries. In the curious not es drawn up b y Savalet te for the guidance of the Marquis de Chefdebien we catch a glimpse of the power beh ind the philosophers of the salons and the aristocra tic adepts of the lodges--the profe ssiona l magicians and m en of m ystery; and behind these again the conce aled directors of the secre t societ ies, the real initiates . T HE M AGICIANS The part pla yed by magicians during the period preced ing the French Revolut ion is of course a matter of co mmon knowledge and has never been disputed b y official histor y. But like the schools of philosophers this sudden crop of ma gicians is alwa ys represen ted as a sporadic growth cal led in to being by the idl e and curious society of th e day. The impor tant point to real ize is that just as the phi losophers were all Freemasons, the princ ipal magicians were not only Free masons but members of occu lt secret socie ties. It is ther efore not as isolated charla tans but as agen ts of som e hidden power that we must regard the m en whom we will now pass in a rapid surve y. One of the first to appe ar in the fie ld was Schroepfer , a coffee-house keeper of Leipz ig, who decl ared tha t no one cou ld be a true Free mason without prac tising m agic. According ly he procl aimed himself the \"reform er of Free masonr y,\" and set up a lodge in his own house with a ri te based on the Rose-Croix degre e for the purpo se of evoking spirits. The meetings took pl ace at dead of night, when b y means of careful ly arranged lights, magic mirrors, and possibly of elec tricity, Schroepfer contriv ed to produce appar itions which his disciples- -under the inf luence of strong punch--took to be visitors"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"from the other world. 442 In the end Schroepfer , driven cra zy by his own incant ations, blew out his brains in a garden near L eipzig. According to Lecou teulx de Cante leu, it was Schroepfer who indoctr inated the famous \"Comte de Sain t-Ger main\"- -\"The Master\" of our mod ern co-m asonic lodges. The ident ity of this mysterious personage has never been established 443 ; by some conte mporaries he was said to be a natura l son of the King of Portuga l, by others the son of a Je w and a Polish Princess. The Duc de Choiseul on being asked whether he knew the orig in of Saint- Germ ain replied : \"No doubt we know it, he is the son of a Portuguese Jew who explo its the creduli ty of the town and Court.\" 444 In 1780 a ru mour went round that his father was a Jew of Bordeaux, but ac cording to the Souven irs of the Mar quise de Créquy the Baron de Bret euil discovered from the archives of his Ministr y that the pretend ed Comte de Sain t-Ger main was the son of a Jewish doctor of Strasbur g, that his real name was Daniel Wolf, and that he wa s born in 1704. 445 The general opinion thus appe ars to have been in favour of his Je wish anc estry. Saint- Germ an see ms first to have been heard of in Ger many about 1740, where his marvellous powers attr acted the atten tion of th e Marécha l de Bel le-Isle, who, alwa ys the ready dupe of charl atans, brought him back with hi m to the Court of France, where he speedi ly gained the favour of Madam e de Pomp adour . The Marquise before long present ed him to the King, w ho grant ed him an apart ment at Cha mbord and, enchan ted by his bril liant wit, frequentl y spent long even ings in conversat ion with him in the roo ms of Mada me de Po mpadou r. Meanwhile his invent ion of flat- botto med boats for th e invasion of England raised hi m still higher in the est imation of the Maréchal de Bel le- Isle. In 1761 w e hear of hi m as living in great splendour in Holland and giving out tha t he had reached the age of sevent y-four, though appearing to be onl y fifty; if this were so, he must have been ninet y-seven at the time of his death in 1784 at Schleswig. But th is feat of longev ity is far from satisf ying his mo dern ad mirers, who declar e that Saint- Germ ain did not die in 1784, but is stil l alive to- day in som e corner of Eastern Europe. This is in accordance with the theor y, said to have been circu lated by Saint- Germ ain hims elf, th at by the eight eenth centur y he had passed through several incarna tions and that th e last one had continued for 1,500 y ears. Barruel, howeve r, expla ins that Saint-Ger main in thus referr ing to his age spoke in m asoni c languag e, in which a man who has taken the first degre e is said to be three years old, aft er the second five, or the third seven, s o that by means of the huge increase the higher degrees conferred it might be quite possible for an exalted adept to att ain the age of 1,500. Saint- Germ ain has been represent ed by modern writers--not onl y those who com pose his following- -as a person of extraord inary attainments, a sort of super-man towering over the minor magicians of his da y. Conte mporari es, ho weve r, take him less s eriousl y and represen t him rather as an expert charlat an whom the wits of the salons made the butt of pleasantries. His princ ipal importance to the subject of th is book consists, ho wever , in his influence on the secre t societ ies. Accord ing to the Mémoi res authen tiques pour servir à l'histoir e du Comte de Cagliostr o , Saint-Ger main was the \"Grand Master of Freemasonr y,\" 446 and it was he who init iated Cagliostro into th e mysteries of Eg yptian masonr y."},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"Joseph Balsa mo, born in 1743, who as sumed the na me of Co mte de Cag liostro, as a magician far ec lipsed his m aster.

According to his o wn accoun t, this rite was derived from a manuscript by a certain Geor ge Cofton--whose ident ity has never been discover ed--which he bought by chan ce in London 450 . Yarker , however , expres ses the opinion that \"th e rite of Cagliostro was clear ly that of Pasquall y,\" and tha t if he acquired it fro m a manuscrip t in London it would indi cate that Pasquill y had discipl es in that city.

At an y rate, in a contemporar y account of Cagliostro we find hi m described as \"a doctor ini tiated into Caba listic art\" and a Rose-Croix; but after founding his own rite he acquir ed the name of Grand Copht, that is to say, Suprem e Head of Eg yptian Masonry, a new branch tha t he wished to graft on to old European Freemasonr y. 451 We shal l return to his further mason ic adven tures lat er. In a superior categor y to Saint- Germ an and Cagliostro was the famous S wabian doctor Mesm er, who has given his nam e to an i mpor tant branch of natur al scien ce. In abou t 1780 Mesm er announc ed his grea t discover y of \"anim al magnetism, the princ iple of life in all organized be ings, the soul of al l that breath es.\" But if to-da y Mesm erism has com e to be regarded as alm ost synonymous with h ypnotism and in no wa y a branch of occultism, Mesmer himself- -stirring the fluid in his m agic bucke t, around which his discip les wept, slept, fell into trances or convulsions, raved or prophesied 452 --earn ed not unnatur ally the reput ation of a charl atan. The Free masons, eag er to discover the secre t of the magic bucket, hastened to enrol him in their Order , and Me smer was received into the Primitive Rite of Free and Accepted Masons in 1785. 453 Space forbids a descript ion of the minor m agicians who flourished at this period- -of Schroeder , founder in 1776 of a chapter of \"T rue and Ancient Rose-Croix Masons,\" practising cer tain magical, theosophica l, and al chemical degrees; of Gassner , worker of miracles in the neighbourhood of Rat isbonne; of \"the Jew Leon,\" one of a band of charlatans who m ade large sums of m oney with m agic mirrors in which th e imaginative were ab le to see their absent friends, and who was final ly banished from France by the police,--a ll these and m any others exploi ted th e credul ity and curiosit y of the upper classes both in France and Germ any betwe en the years of 1740 and 1790.

Let us turn, then, to events taking place at this moment in the world of Je wry and see whether these m ay provide so me clue. 8. T HE J EWISH C ABALIST S It has been sho wn in the prec eding chap ters tha t the Jewish Caba la pla yed an important part in the occult and ant i-Christi an sects fro m the ver y beginn ing of the Christian era. The time has now com e to enquire what part Jewish influen ce played meanwhile in revolu tions. Merel y to ask the question is to bring on oneself the accusat ion of \"ant i- Semitism,\" yet the Jewish writer Bernard L azare has s hown the falseness of this char ge: This [he writes] is what m ust separa te the impar tial histori an fro m anti-Semitism. The anti-Semite says: \"The Jew is th e preparer , the machina tor, the chief engineer of revolu tions\"; the impartial histori an confin es him self to stud ying the part which the Jew , consider ing his spirit, his charac ter, the nature of his philosoph y, and his religion, may have taken in revolut ionar y processes and m ovements. 455 Lazare hims elf expres ses the opinion, however , that- - The complaint of the ant i-Semites see ms to be founded: the Jew ha s the revolut ionar y spirit ; consciousl y or not he is an agent of revo lution. Yet the co mplaint complicates itself, for ant i-Semitism accuses the Jews of being the cause of revolu tions. Le t us examine what this ac cusation is worth.... 456 In the light of our present knowledge it would certain ly be absurd to ascribe to the Jews the authorship of th e conspirac y of Cati line or of the Gracchi, the rising of Jack Straw and Wat Tyler, Jack Cade's rebel lion, th e jacqueries of France, or the Peasants' Wars in Germany, although historic al resear ch may lead in time to the discover y of cer tain occul t influences--not necessaril y Jewish--behind the Europ ean insurrec tions here referred to. Moreover , apart fro m grievanc es or other causes of rebe llion, the revolution ary spirit has always existed indep endent ly of the Jews. In all times and in al l countr ies there have been men born to m ake trouble as the sparks fl y upward."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"Neverth eless, in m odern revolut ions the part played by the Jews cannot be ignored, and the influen ce the y have exer cised wil l be seen on exa mination to have been twofold-- finan cial and occu lt. Throughout the Middl e Ages it is as s orcer ers and usurers that th ey incur the reproa ches of the Christian world, and it is still in the sa me role, under the m ore modern terms of m agicians and loan- mongers, that we detec t their presence behind the scenes of revolu tion from the seventeenth centur y onward. Wher ever m oney was to be made out of socia l or poli tical upheav als, weal thy Jews have been found to back the winning side; and wherever the Christ ian rac es have turned against their own insti tutions, Jewish Rabbis, philosophers, professors, and occul tists have lent th em their support. It was not then necessaril y that Jews crea ted these movements, but the y knew ho w to make use of the m for the ir own ends. It is thus that in the Great Rebel lion we find them not a mongst the Ironsides of Cro mwell or the members of his State Council, but furnishing m oney and infor mation to the insurgents, ac ting as army contra ctors, loan- mongers, and super -spies--or to use the m ore euphonious term of Mr . Lucien Wolf, as \"pol itical intel ligenc ers\" of extraord inary efficiency. Thus Mr . Lucien Wolf, in referring to Carvajal, \"the grea t Jew of the Commonwe alth,\" explains that \"the wide ra mifications of his co mmercial transact ions and his relat ions with other Crypto-Jews all over the world plac ed him in an unriva lled position to obta in news of the ene mies of th e Commonwea lth.\" 457 It is obvious that a \"secret service\" of this kind rendered the Jews a form idable hidden power , the more so since their very existenc e was frequentl y unknown to the rest of the popula tion around the m. This precaut ion was necessar y because Jews were not supposed to exist at that date in England. In 1290 Edward I had expe lled them all, and for three and a half centur ies the y had re mained in exile ; the Crypto-Jew s or Marranos who had co me over from Spain contr ived, however , to re main in the countr y by skilfully taking the colour of their surroundings. Mr . Wolf goes on to observe that Jewish services were regul arly held in the secret Synagogue, but \"in public Carva jal and his friends followed the pract ice of the secret Jews in Spain and Portugal, passing as Rom an Catho lics and regul arly attending mass in the Spanish Ambassador' s chap el.\" 458 But when war between England and Spain rendered this expedien t inadv isable, the Marranos threw of f the disguise of Christiani ty and procl aimed themselves followers of th e Jewish faith. Now, just at this period the Messianic era was general ly believed by the Jew s to be approa ching, and it appe ars to have occurred to them that Cro mwell might be fitted to the part. Consequentl y emissaries were despatched to search the archiv es of Cam bridge in order to discover whether the Prote ctor could possibly be of Jewish descent. 459 This quest proving fruitless, the Cabalist Rabbi of Amst erdam, Manas seh ben I srael, 460 addressed a petition to Cro mwel l for the readmission of the Jew s to England, in which he adro itly insisted on the re tribut ion that overtak es those who af flict the people of Israel and the rewards tha t await those who \"cherish\" the m. These ar guments were not without ef fect on Cromwel l, who enter tained the sa me superstition, and al though he is said to have declined the Jews ' offer to buy St. Paul' s Cath edral and the Bodleian Librar y because he consider ed the £500,000 the y offered inadequat e, 461 he exert ed ever y effort to obta in the ir readmission to th e countr y. In this he encoun tered violent opposition, and it seems that"},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Jews w ere not per mitted to return in lar ge num bers, or at any rate to enjo y full righ ts and privileges, unt il after the accession of Charles II, who in his turn had enlisted their finan cial aid. 462 Later, in 1688, the Jews of Amsterda m helped with the ir credi t the exped ition of William of Orange against James II; the form er in return brought many Jews with hi m to England. So a Je wish writer is able to boast tha t \"a Monarch reigned who was indebted to Hebrew gold for his ro yal diade m.\" 463 In all this it is i mpossibl e to fol low an y consecut ive pol itical plan; th e rôle of the Jew s seems to have been to support no cause consistently but to obta in a footing in every camp, to back any ventur e that offered a chance of profit. Yet mingled with these m aterial designs were sti ll the ir anc ient Messiani c drea ms. It is curious to note tha t the same Messianic idea pervaded the Leve llers, the rebels of the Com monwea lth; such phrases a s \"Let Israel go free,\" \"Israel's restorat ion is now beginning,\" recur frequen tly in the literature of the sect. Gerard Winstanle y, one of the two princip al leaders, addressed an epistle to \"the Twelve Tribes of Israel that are circu mcised in heart and scattered through all the Nations of the Earth,\" and prom ised the m \"David their King th at the y have been waiting for .\" The other leader of the m ovement, by name Everard, in fact declared, when summoned before the Lord Fairfax at Whitehall, that \"he was of the race of the Jews.\" 464 It is true tha t the Level lers were b y profession Christi an, but af ter the manner of the Bavar ian Il luminati and of the Christ ian Socia lists two cen turies la ter, claiming Christ as the author of th eir Co mmunistic and equa litarian doctrines: \"For Jesus Christ, the Saviour of all Men, is the greatest, first, and truest Leve ller that ever was s poken of in the world.\" The Level lers are said to have derived original ly from the Ger man Anabaptists; but Claud io Jannet, quoting Ger man authori ties, show s that ther e were Jews am ongst the Anabapt ists. \"The y were carr ied away by their hatred of th e name of Christian and imagined that their dream s of the restoration of the kingdo m of Israel would be real ized amidst the conflagra tion.\" 465 Wheth er this was so or not, it is clear that by the m iddle of the seventeen th cen tury the mystical ideas of Judais m had penetr ated into a ll parts of Europe. Was ther e then some Cabal istic centre from which the y radia ted? Let us turn our eyes eastward and we shall see. Since the sixt eenth centur y the great mass of Je wry had settled in Poland, and a succession of m iracle-workers kno wn by the name of Zaddik im or Ba'al Shems had arisen. The la tter word, which signifies \"Master of the Nam e,\" orig inated with the German Polish Je ws and was derived from the Cabalist ic belief in the miraculous u se of the sacred na me of Jehovah, known as the Tetragr ammaton. According to Cabal istic tradi tions, cert ain Jews of peculi ar sanct ity or knowledge were able with i mpunit y to m ake use of the Divin e Nam e. A Ba'al Shem was therefore one w ho had acquired this power and e mployed it in writing amulets, invoking spirits, and prescrib ing cures for various diseases. P oland and part icular ly Podolia- -which had not yet been ceded to Rus sia--beca me thus a cen tre of Caba lism where a series of extr aordinar y movements of a mystical kind followed each other . In 1666, when the Messianic era was still believed to be approa ching, the whole Jewish w orld was convulsed by the sudden appearance of Shabbethai Zebi, the son of a poul terer in Sm yrna named Mordecai, who procl aimed himself the prom ised Mes siah and ral lied to his support a huge following not"},{"pageNumber":125,"pageContent":"only amongst the Jews of Palestin e, Eg ypt, and Eastern Europe, but even the hard-headed Jews of the Contin ental bourses. 466 Samuel Pep ys in his Diar y refers to the bets ma de amongst the Jews in London on the chances of \"a certa in person now in S myrna\" being acclaimed King of the World and the true Messiah. 467 Shabbeth ai, who was an expert Cabalist and had th e temerity to utt er the Ineffable Nam e Jehovah, was said to be pos sessed of m arvellous powers, his s kin exuded exquisi te perfu me, he indu lged perpe tually in sea- bathing and lived in a stat e of chronic ecstas y. The pretensions of Shabbeth ai, who took th e title of \"King of the Kings of the E arth,\" split Jewr y in two; m any Rabbis launch ed imprecations against him, and those who had believed in hi m were bitt erly disillusioned when, chall enged b y the Sultan to prove his claim to be the Messiah by allowing poisoned arrows to be shot at him, he suddenl y renounc ed the Jewish fai th and procl aimed himself a Moha mmedan. His conversion, however , appeared to be onl y partia l, for \"at times he w ould assume the rôle of a pious Moha mmedan and revile Judaism; at others he would en ter into relations with Jews as one of their own fai th.\" 468 By this m eans he reta ined the allegianc e both of Mosle ms and of Jews. But the Rabb is, alar med for the cause of Judaism , succe eded in obtaining his incarcera tion by the Sultan in a cast le near Belgrad e, where he di ed of coli c in 1676. 469 This prosaic ending to the career of the Mes siah did not, however , altog ether extinguish the enthusias m of his followers, and the Shabbethan mov ement cont inued into the next century. In Poland Cabalis m broke out with renewed ener gy; fresh Zaddiki m and Ba'al Shems arose, th e most noted of these be ing Israel of Podoli a, known as Ba'al She m Tob, or by the initial letters of this na me, Besht, who founded his sect of Ha sidim in 1740. Besht, whilst opposing bigoted Rabbinis m and cla iming the Zohar as his inspirat ion, did not, however , adhere strictl y to the doctrin e of the Cabala that the universe was an emanation of God, but evolved a for m of Panth eism, declaring that the whole universe was God, that even evil exists in God since evil is not bad in i tself but only in its relat ion to Man; sin therefore has no positive existenc e. 470 As a result the followers of Besht, calling themselv es the \"New Saints,\" and at his dea th nu mbering no less than 40,000, threw aside not onl y the prec epts of the Talmud, but all th e restrain ts of mo rality and even decency. 471 Another Ba'al Shem of the same period was Heilprin, alias Joel Ben Uri of Satanov , who, like Israel of Podolia, professed to perform miracles by the use of the Divine Na me and collected around him many pupils, who, on the dea th of the ir master, \"for med a band of charlatans and sham elessl y exploit ed the creduli ty of the ir conte mporari es.\" 472 But the m ost importan t of these Cabalist ic groups was that of the Frankists, who were sometimes known as the Zoharists or the Illuminated, 473 from their adherence to the Zohar or book of Light, or in the ir birthp lace Podolia as the Shabbethan Zebists, fro m their allegian ce to the false Messiah of the prec eding cen tury--a heres y that had been \"kept alive in secre t circ les which had something akin to a ma sonic organization.\" 474 The founder of this sect was Jacob Frank, a brand y distill er profoundl y versed in the doctrines of the Cabala, who in 1755 coll ected around hi m a large following in Podolia and lived in"},{"pageNumber":126,"pageContent":"a style of orien tal magnificence, maintained by vast weal th of which no one ever discover ed the source. The persecut ion to which he was s ubjected by the Rabbis led the Catho lic clergy to champion his cause, whereupon Frank threw him self on the m ercy of the Bishop of Kam inick, and publi cly burnt the Talmud, decl aring th at he recognized only the Zohar , which, he al leged, admitted the doctrin e of the Trinity. Thus the Zoharists \"claimed that they regarded the Messiah- Deliverer as one of the three div inities, but failed to state that by the Mes siah they meant Shabbe thai Zebi.\" 475 The Bishop wa s appar ently deceiv ed by this m anoeuvre, and in 1759 the Zoharit es declar ed the mselves conver ted to Christiani ty, and were bapti zed, inc luding Frank hims elf, who took th e name of Joseph. \"The insinc erity of the Frankists soon beca me appar ent, however , for the y continued to inter -marry only among themselv es and held Frank in reveren ce, ca lling him 'The Hol y Maste r.'\" 476 It soon bec ame evident that, whilst openl y embracing the Catholi c faith, the y had in rea lity retained the ir secret Judaism . 477 Moreove r, it was discover ed tha t Frank ende avoured to pass as a Moha mmedan in Turkey; \"he was therefor e arrested in Warsaw and deliv ered to the Church tribunal on the char ge of feigned conversion to Christi anity and the spread ing of a pern icious heres y.\" 478 Unlike his predecessor in apostas y, Shabbe thai Zebi, Frank, howeve r, came to no unt imely end, but after his re lease from prison continued to pre y on the credul ity of Christ ians and frequen tly travelled to Vienna with his daughter , Eve, who succeed ed in duping the pious Maria Theresa. But here also \"the sectarian plans of Frank were found out,\" 479 and he wa s obliged to leave Austria. Finall y he settled at Offenbach and supported b y liberal subsidi es from the other Jews, he resum ed his for mer splendour 480 with a retinu e of several hundred beaut iful Jewish y outh of both sexes; carts con taining treasure were report ed to be perpetua lly brought in to hi m, chief ly from Poland- -he went out daily in great state to perform his devo tions in the open fie ld--he rode in a char iot drawn b y noble horses; ten or twelv e Hulans in red or green unifor m, glittering with gold, by his side, with pikes in th eir hands and crests on their caps, eagles, or stag s, or th e sun and moon.... His followers believ ed him immortal, but in 1791 he died; his burial was as splendid as his mo de of l iving--800 persons followed him to the grave. 481 Now, it is i mpossible to study the car eers of these m agicians in Poland and Germ any without being reminded of their counterpar ts in France. The family likeness between the \"Baron von O ffenbach,\" the \"Co mte de Saint-Ger main\" and the \"Com te de Cagliostro\" is at once appar ent.

If then it is agre ed that neith er Saint- Germ ain nor Cagliostro can be proved to have been Jews, here we have a man concerned in the movement, more important than either , whose na tional ity admits of no doubt whateve r. This extraordinar y personage, known as the \"Ba'al Shem of London,\" was a Cabalist ic Jew nam ed Hayyim Samuel Jacob Falk, also cal led Dr . Falk, Falc, de Falk, or Falkon, born in 1708, probabl y in Podoli a. The further fact that he was regarded b y his fe llow- Jews a s an adherent of the Messiah Shabbeth ai Zeb i clearly shows his connexion with the Podolian Zohari tes. Falk was thus not an isolated phenom enon, but a m ember of one of the groups de scribed in the foregoing pages. The following is a sum mary of the ac count given of the Ba'al Shem of London in the Jewish Enc ycloped ia : Falk claimed to possess thau maturgic powers and to be able to discover hidden tre asure. Archenhol z ( England und Itali en , I. 249) recoun ts certa in marvels which he had seen perfor med by Falk in Brun swick and which he a ttribu tes to a special knowledg e of chemistry. In Westphal ia at one ti me Falk wa s senten ced to be burned as a sorcere r, but escaped to Engl and. Here he was rece ived with hospital ity and rapidl y gained fa me as a Caba list and worker of mi racles. Man y stories of his powers were current. He w ould cause a sm all taper to re main alight for weeks; an incan tation would fill his cel lar with coal; plate left with a pawnbroker would glid e back into his house. When a fire threatened to destro y the Great Synagogue, he avert ed the disaster b y writing four Hebrew le tters on the pillars of the door . 482 [Obviousl y the Tetragra mmaton.] On his arriva l in London in 1742 Falk appe ared to be without means, but soon aft er he was seen to be in pos session of considerab le wealth, living in a comfort able house in Wellclose Square, where he had his priva te synagogue, whilst gold and silv er plat e adorned his table. His J ournal, still preserved in the libr ary of the United S ynagogue, contains referen ces to \" mysterious j ourne yings\" to and fro m Epping Forest, to meetings, a meeting-cha mber in th e forest, and chests of gold there buried. It was said that on one occasion when he was driving th ither along Whitechape l Road, a back wheel of his carriage came off, which alarmed the coach man, but Falk ordered hi m to drive on and the wheel followed the carri age al l the way to the forest."},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"The stories of Falk's mi raculous power s are too nu merous to rela te here, but a le tter written by an en thusiastic Jewish ad mirer, Sussman Shesnowzi, to his s on in Poland will serve to show the reputat ion he enjo yed: Hear, my beloved son, of th e marvellous gifts entrusted to a son of ma n, who veril y is not a man, a light of the captivity ... a hol y light, a saintl y man ... who d wells at present in th e great city of London.

And albe it it cont ained oil to burn a da y and a night i t remained enk indled for thre e weeks. On one occasion he abode in seclusion in his hou se for six weeks without meat and drink. When at the conclusion of this period ten persons were summoned to ent er, they found him seated on a sort of thron e, his head covered with a golden turban, a golden cha in round his neck with a pendan t silver star on which sacred names were inscribed. Verily this m an stands alone in his generat ion b y reason of his knowledge of hol y mysteries. I cannot recount to you all the wonders he ac complishes.

Therefore, my son, be ver y circumspect, and show this onl y to wise and discreet men. For here in London this master has not been disclosed to an yone who does not belong to our Brotherhood. The estee m in which Falk was held by the Jewish co mmunity, includ ing the Chief Rabbi and the Rabbi of the new S ynagogue, appe ars to have roused the resent ment of his co- religionist Emden, who denounc ed him as a follower of the false Messiah and an explo iter of Christian creduli ty. Falk [he w rote in a letter to Poland] had m ade his po sition b y his pre tence to be an adept in practi cal Cabala, by which means he profes sed to be able to discover hidden tre asures; by his pret ensions he had entr apped a wealth y captain whose fortun e he had cheated him out of, so that he was reduced to depending on the Rabbi' s char ity, and y et, despite th is, wealthy Christi ans spend their mon ey on hi m, whilst Falk spends his bount y on the men of his Brotherhood so that th ey may spread his fam e. In gener al Falk appears to have displa yed extre me caution in his relat ions with Christi an seekers aft er occu lt knowledge, for the Jewish Encyc lopædia goes on to sa y: \"Archenhol z mentions a ro yal prince who applied to Falk in his quest for the philosopher' s stone, but was denied admittance.\" Neverthe less Ha yyum Azula i mentions (Ma'gal Tob, p. 13 b ): That when in Paris in 1778 he was told b y the Marchesa de Crona that the Ba'al Shem of London had taught her the Cabala. Falk see ms also to have been on inti mate terms with that strange adventurer Baron Theodor de Neuho ff....

Falk, though his nam e is not m entioned.\" 484 This m an is described as \"a chr istened Jew and the biggest rogue and vil lain in all the world,\" who \"had been imprisoned ever ywhere and banished out of all countri es in Germ any, and also som etimes publi cly whipped, so that his back lost al l the old skin, and bec ame new again, and yet left never off from his vill ainies, but grew alwa ys worse.\" The writer goes on to rela te that the Cabalist offered to teach him certain mysteries, but expla ined tha t before entering on an y \"experi ments of the said godl y mysteries, we mus t first avoid al l churches and places of wor shipp ing as uncle an\"; he then bound his ini tiate by a very strong oath and proce eded to tell him that he must steal a Hebrew Bible from a Protest ant and also procure \"one pound of blood out of the veins of an honest Protestant.\" The ini tiate thereupon robbed a Protest ant of all his ef fects, but had hims elf bled of about three- quart ers of a pound of blood, which he gave to the m agician. He thus describes the ceremony that took place : Then the next night about 1 1 o'clock, we both went into th e garden of m y own, and the cabalist put a cross, tain ted with my blood, in each corner of the garden, and in the middle of the garden a threefo ld circ le ... in the first circl e were writt en all the names of God in Hebrew; in the second all th e names of the angels; and in the third the first chapter of the holy Gospel of St. John, and it was all writt en with my blood. The cruelt ies then perform ed by the Caba list on a he-goat are too loa thsom e to transcribe. The whole stor y, indeed, appears a farrago of nonsense and would not be worth quoting but for the fac t that it appears to be taken seriousl y by Dr. Adler as a description of the great Ba'al Shem. The death of Falk took pla ce on April 17, 1782, and the epitaph on his grave in the cemetery at Globe Road, Mile End, \"bears witness to his exc ellencies and orthodox y\": \"Here is in terred ... the aged and honourable man, a great personage who cam e from the East, an acco mplished sage, an adep t in Cabba lah.... His na me was kno wn to the ends of the earth and distant isles,\" etc. This then is surel y the portrai t of a m ost remarkab le personage, a man known for his powers in Engl and, France, and Germ any, visited b y a royal princ e in search of the philosopher's stone, and acclaimed by one of his own race as standing alone in his gener ation by reason of his knowledge, y et whilst Saint- Germ ain and Cagliostro figure in every account of eight eenth- centur y magicians, it is onl y in exc lusivel y Judaic or masoni c work s, not intended for the general public, that we shall find an y reference to Falk. Have we not here striking evid ence of the truth of M . André Baron' s dictum: \"Remember that the constan t rule of the secret societ ies is that the real authors never show the mselv es\"? It will now be asked: what proof is there that Falk is connec ted with any masonic or secre t societ ies?

Moreover , it is signifi cant to find in the Royal Masonic En cyclopæd ia by the Rosicrucian Kenneth Mackenzi e that a long and detai led artic le is devot ed to Falk, though again without any referen ce to his connexion with Free masonr y. May we not conclude that in certain inner m asoni c circ les the importance of Falk is recogniz ed but must not be revealed to the uniniti ated? Mr . Gordon Hills, in the above-quoted paper con tributed to the Ars Quatuor Cor onatorum , indulg es in som e inno cent speculation as to the part Falk may have pla yed in the m asonic movement. \"If,\" he observes, \"Jewish Brethren did introdu ce Caba listical learning into the so-cal led High Degrees, here we have one, who, if a Mason, would have been e minentl y qualif ied to do so.\" Falk inded was far m ore than a Mason, he was a high in itiate--the suprem e oracle to which the secret societ ies appli ed for guidanc e. All this was disclosed a few y ears ago in the correspondence between Savalet te de Langes and the Marquis de Chefdebi en referred to in the previous chapte r. Thus in the dossiers of the leading occul tists supplied by Saval ette we find the following note on the Ba'al She m of London: This Doctor Falk is known to m any Germ ans. He is a ver y extraordinar y man from every point of view . Some people believe him to be the Chief of al l the Jews and at tribut e to purel y polit ical sche mes a ll tha t is m arvellous and singular in his life and conduct. He is referr ed to in a ver y curious m anner, and as a Rose-Croix in th e Memoirs of the Cheva lier de Ramp sow (i.e. Rentzov). He has had adventures with the Maréch al de Richelieu, great seeker of the Philosophers' Stone.

In al l the sects of savants in secre t scien ces he passes as a superior m an. He is at present in England. The Baron de Gleichen can give good infor mation about him. Try to get more at Frankfurt. 485 Again, in notes on other personages the na me of Falk recurs with the same insistenc e on his impor tance as a high initiate: Leman, pupi l of Falk.... The Baron de Glei chen ... in timately connect ed with Wecter [W aechter] and Wakenfeld t.... He knows Falk....

For Falk, as we see in these notes, wa s not an isolat ed sage; he had pupils, and to be one of these was to be adm itted to the inner m ysteries. Was Cagliostro one of th ese adepts? I s it here we m ay seek the explana tion of th e \"Eg yptian Rite\" devised by him in London, and of his chan ce discover y on a bookstall in tha t city of a Cabalist ic docu ment by the mysterious \"George Cofton,\" who se identi ty has never been revealed? I w ould suggest that the whole stor y of th e bookstall was a fable and that it was not from any manuscr ipt, but from Falk, tha t Cagl iostro rece ived his direct ions. Thus Cagliostro's rite was in rea lity concea led Caba lism. That Falk was onl y one of several Conce aled Superiors is further suggested b y the intriguing correspondence of Savalet te de Langes. \"Schroeder ,\" we read, \"had for his master an old man of Suabia,\" by whom the Baron de Waechter was also said to have been instructed in Masonr y, and to have beco me one of th e most important initiates of Germany. According ly de Waecht er was despatched by his O rder to Florence in order to make enquir ies on further secrets and on cer tain famous treasures about which Schroepfer , the Baron de Hundt, and others, had heard tha t Aprosi, the secretar y of the Pretend er, could give th em infor mation. Waechter, however , wrote to say that all they had been told on th e latter point was fabulous, but tha t he had me t in Florence certa in \"Brothers of the Hol y Land,\" who had initiated him into marvellous secre ts; one in particular who is described as \"a man who is not a Europ ean\" had \"perfectl y instruct ed him.\" Moreover , de Waechter, who had set forth poor , returned loaded with riches attribut ed by his fel low-masons to the \"Asiat ic Brethr en\" he had frequented in Florence who pos sessed the art of m aking gold. 487 I would suggest then that these were the members of the \"Itali an Order\" referred to by Mr. Tucket t, which, like Schroepfer and de Hundt, he imagined to have been conne cted with the Jacobites. But all these secret sources of instruction are wrapped in m ystery. Whilst Saint- Germ ain and Cagliostro--who is referred to in this correspondence in ter ms of light derision-- emerge into the limelight, the rea l initiates re main conce aled in the background. Falk \"is almost ina ccessible!\" Yet one mo re almost for gotten docu ment of the period m ay throw some light on the i mpor tant part he played behind the scenes in Masonr y. It may be re member ed tha t Archenhol z had spoken of cer tain marvels he had seen perfor med by Falk in Brun swick. Now, in 1770 the Ger man poet Gotthold Ephrai m Lessing was made librar ian to the Duke of Brunswick in that c ity. The fame of Falk m ay then have rea ched his ears. At an y rate in 1771 Lessing, after hav ing m ocked at Freemasonr y, was initi ated in a m asoni c lodge at Ha mbur g, and in 1778 he published not only his fam ous ma sonic dram a Nathan der W eise , in which the Jew of Jerusale m is shown in ad mirable contrast to the Christ ians and Moha mmedans, but he also wrote five dialogues on Free masonr y which he dedic ated to the Duke of Brun swick, Grand Master"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"of all the Germ an Lodges, and w hich he ent itled \" Ernst und Fal k: Gesp räche fur Freimaurer .\" 488 Lessing's friendship with Moses Mendelssohn has led to the popular theor y, unsupported however b y any real evidence, that the Jewish philosopher of Berlin provid ed the inspira tion for the chara cter of Nathan, but might it not equall y have been provided b y the miracle-worker of Bruns wick? Ho weve r, in the case of the dialogu es less room is left for doubt. Falk is m entioned b y name and represented as initiated into the highest m ysteries of Free masonr y. This is of course not explained by Lessing's com mentators, who give no clue to his id entity. 489 It is eviden t that Lessing co mmitted an enorm ous blunder in thus letting so im portan t a ca t out of the bag, for aft er the publica tion of the first three dialogues and whilst the last two were circu lating priva tely in m anuscrip t amongst the Freemasons, an order from the Duke of Brun swick forbade the ir publi cation as dangerous. In spit e of this prohib ition, the rest of the series was printed, however without Lessing's perm ission, in 1870 with a prefa ce by an unkno wn person describ ing hi mself as a non-mason. The dialogues between Ernst and Falk throw a curious light on the inf luences a t work behind Freem asonr y at this period and gain immensely in interest when the iden tity of the two m en in question is understood. Thus Ernst, b y whom Lessing evid ently represents himself, is at the beginn ing not a Freem ason, and, whilst sitting with Falk in a wood, questions the high in itiate on the ai ms of the Order . Falk expla ins that Freem asonr y has always existed, but not under this name. Its rea l purpose has never been revea led. On the surface it appe ars to be a purel y philanthropi c associat ion, but in reali ty philanthrop y forms no part of its sche me, its object being to bring about a state of th ings w hich will render philan throp y unnecessar y. ( Was man gemeinl ich gut e Thaten zu nennen pflegt entbehrlich zu machen .) As an illustr ation Falk points to an ant- heap at the foot of the tree beneath which the two m en are seat ed. \"Wh y,\" he asks, \"should not hum an beings exist without govern ment like the ants or bees ?\" Falk then goes on to describ e his idea of a Universal State, or rather a federat ion of Stat es, in which m en will no longer be div ided by national, social, or religious prejudic es, and where great er equa lity will exist. At the end of the third dia logue an interva l occurs during which Ernst goes awa y and becomes a Free mason, but on his return expresse s his disappo intment to Falk at finding many Freem asons engaged in such futi lities as alche my or the evocat ion of spirits. Others again seek to revive th e * * *. Falk repl ies tha t although the great secre ts of Freem asonr y canno t be reve aled by any man even if he wished it, one th ing, however , has been kept dark which should now be made public, and this is the relat ionship between the Freemasons and the * * *. \"The * * * were in fac t the Freemasons of their time.\" It see ms probabl e from the contex t and fro m Falk' s refer ences to Sir Christopher Wren as the founder of the m odern Order, that the aster isks deno te the Rosicrucians. The most interesting point of these dialogues is, ho wever , the hint cont inually thrown out by Falk that there is so mething behind Freem asonr y, something far older and far wider in its aims than the Order now known b y this na me--the m odern Free masons are for the most part onl y \"playing at it.\" Thus, when Ernst complains that true equa lity has not been"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"attained in the lodges since Jews are not admitted, Falk observes that he hi mself does not attend th em, that true Freem asonr y does not exist in outward forms- -\"A lodge bears the same relat ion to Freemasonr y as a church to bel ief.\" In other word s, the real initiates do not appear upon the scene. Here then we see the role of the \"Concea led Superiors.\" What wonder tha t Lessing's dialogues were considered too dangerous for public ation! Moreover , in Falk's concept ion of the ideal social order and his indi ctment of what he calls \"bour geois socie ty\" we find the clue to m ovements of i mmense importanc e. Has not the system of the ant-heap or the beeh ive proved, as I have point ed out elsewher e, the model on which m odern Anarchists, from Proudhon on wards, have form ed the ir sche mes for the reorganiz ation of hum an lif e? Has not the idea of the \"W orld Stat e,\" \"The Universal Republic\" beco me the war-cry of the Interna tionalist Socia lists, the Grand Orient Masons, the Theosophists, and the world-revolution aries of our own da y? Was Falk, then, a revolut ionar y? This again will be disput ed. Falk m ay have been a Caba list, a Freemason, a high initiate, but what proof is there tha t he had an y connexion with the le aders of the French Revolut ion? Let us turn again to the Jewish Enc yclopæd ia : Falk ... is ... believ ed to have given th e Duc d' Orléans, to ensure his succession to the throne, a talisman consisting of a ring, which Philipp e Egal ité before m ounting the scaffold is said to have sent to a Jewess, J uliet Goudchaux, who passed it on to his son, subsequentl y Louis Philipp e. The Baron de Glei chen, who \"knew Falc,\" refers to a ta lisman of lapis-la zuli which the Due d'Orleans had rec eived in England from \"the celebr ated Falk Scheck, first Rabbi of the Jews,\" and sa ys that a cert ain occult ist, Mada me de la Croix, i magined she had destro yed it by \"the power of pra yer.\" But the theor y of its surviva l is further confir med by the infor mation suppli ed fro m Jewish sources to Mr . Gordon Hills, who states tha t Falk was \"in touch with th e French Court in the person of 'Prince Emanuel,' 490 whom he describ es as a servant of the King of France,\" and adds that the ta lismanic ring which he gave to the Due d'Orleans \"is sti ll in the posses sion of the fa mily, having passed to King Louis Philippe and thence to the Com te de Paris.\" 491 One fac t, then, looms out of the darkness that envelops the secret power behind the Orléan ist conspirac y, one fac t of suprem e importan ce, and based mo reover on purel y Jewish evidenc e: the Duke was in touch with Falk when in London and Falk supported his sche me of usurpation. Thus behind the arch-conspirator of the revo lution stood \"the Chief of all the Jews.\" I s it here perhaps, in Falk's \"chests of gold,\" tha t we m ight find the source of so me of those loans raised in London b y the Due d' Orléans to financ e the riots of the Revolut ion, so absurdl y described as \"l'or de Pitt\"? The direct connexion between the at tack on the French m onarchy and Jewish circ les in London is further shown b y the curious sequel to the Gordon Rio ts. In 1780 the half- witted Lord George Gordon (as a Jewish writer describes hi m), the head of the so-cal led \"Protestan t\" mob, marched on the House of Com mons to prot est against the bi ll for th e relief of Ro man Cathol ic disabili ties and then proceed ed to carry out his plan of burning"},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"down London. During the five da ys' rioting that ensued, propert y to the amount of £180,000 was destro yed. After this \"the scion of the ducal house of G ordon proved th e durabi lity of his love for Protest antism by profes sing the Hebrew faith,\" and was receiv ed with the highest honour s into the Synagogue. The sa me Jewish write r, who has described him earlier as half- witted, quotes this paneg yric on his orthodox y: \"He was ver y regular in his Je wish observances; every morning he was seen with the phila cteries between his eyes, and oppo site his hear t.... His Saturda y's bread was baked ac cording to the m anner of the Jews, his wine was Jewish, his me at was Jewish, and he was the best Jew in the congreg ation of Israel.\" And it was im mediately after his conversion to Judaism that he published in The Publ ic Advertiser the libel against Marie Antoinet te which brought about his imprison ment in Newgate. 492 Now we kno w tha t Lord Geor ge Gordon m et Cagliostro in London in 1786. 493 Is it not probabl e that the author of the scurrilous pa mphl et and the m agician concern ed in th e attack on the Queen's honour through the Affair of the Necklac e--one a- -Jew by profession, the other said to be a Jew b y race- -may have had som e connex ion with Philippe Ega lité's Jewish supporter , the miracle worker of Wellclose Square? But alread y a vaster gen ius than Falk or Cagliostro, than Pasquall y or Savalet te de Lang es, had arisen, who, gath ering in to his hands the threads of all the conspiracies, was able to weave them together into a gigant ic sche me for the destruction of France and of the world. 9. T HE B AVARIAN I LLUMINA TI The question of the system to which I shall henc eforth refer simply as Illu minism is of such i mmense importanc e to an understanding of the m odern revolution ary movement that, although I have alread y described i t in de tail in World Revolution , it is necessar y to devot e a further chapt er to i t here in order to answer the objections m ade against my former account of the Order and also to show its connexion with earl ier secret socie ties. Now, the m ain cont entions of those writers who, either consciousl y or unconsciousl y, attempt to m islead the publi c on the true natur e and rea l exist ence of Illu minism are: Firstl y, that the case against Illuminism rests solel y on the works of Robison, and of Barrue l and la ter Catholi c authori ties. Secondl y, that all these writers misinterpr eted or mi squoted the Illu minati, who should be judged onl y by their own work s. Third ly, that in reali ty the Illuminati were perfec tly innocuous and even praiseworth y."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"Fourthl y, that they are of no i mport ance, since the y ceased to exist in 1786. In the present chap ter I propose ther efore to answer all these conten tions in turn and at the same time to m ake further exa mination in to the origins of the Order. O RIGINS OF THE I LLU MINA TI That Weishaupt was not the origina tor of the system he na med Illu minism will be alread y appar ent to every reader of the present work; it has needed, in fact, all th e foregoing chapters to tra ce the source of Weishaupt's doctrines throughout the histor y of the world. From these it will be ev ident that men aiming at the overthrow of the exist ing socia l order and of all ac cepted relig ion had existed fro m the ear liest times, and that in the Cainit es, the Carpocrat ians, the Manichæns, the Batinis, th e Fati mites, and the Kar mathites ma ny of Weishaupt's ideas had alread y been foreshadowed. To the Manichæans, in fac t, the word \"Illu minati\" may be trac ed--\"glori antur Manichæ i se de ca elo illuminatos.\" 494 It is in the sect of Abdull ah ibn Ma ymūn that we must seek the mod el for Weishaupt's system of organization. Thus de Sac y has describ ed in the following words the manner of enlisting proselytes by the Ismailis: They proceeded to the admission and initiation of new pro selytes onl y by degrees and with great reserve ; for, as the sect had at the same time a polit ical object and a mbitions, its interest was above all to have a great num ber of part isans in al l plac es and in al l classes of socie ty. It was nec essary therefore to suit the mselves to the char acter, the temperament, and the prejudices of the grea ter nu mber ; what one reveal ed to so me would have revolted others and a lienated for ever spirits less bold and conscienc es mo re easi ly alarmed. 495 This passage exact ly describes th e methods laid down by Weishaupt for his \"Insinua ting Brothers\"- -the necessit y of proceeding with cau tion in the enl isting of adepts, of not revealing to the novice doc trines tha t might be likely to revolt him, of \"speak ing sometimes in one wa y, sometimes in another , so that one's real purpo se should remain impenetrable\" to m embers of the infer ior grades. How did these Orien tal methods pene trate to the Bavarian profes sor? According to certain writers, through the Jesuits. The fact that Weishaup t had been brought up b y this Order has provided the ene mies of the Jesuits with the argument that they were th e secret inspirers of the Illu minati. Mr . Gould, ind eed, has at tribut ed most of the errors of the latter to this source; Weishaup t, he writ es, incurred \"the i mplacab le enmity of the Jesuits, to whose intr igues he was incessant ly exposed.\" 496 In reali ty precisely the opposite was the case, for , as we shall see, it was Weishaupt who perpe tually intrigu ed aga inst the Jesuits. That Weishaup t did, however , draw to a cer tain extent on Je suit methods of training is recognized even b y Barrue l, himself a Jesuit, who, quoting Mirabeau, says that Weishaupt \"adm ired above al l those laws, that régime of the Jesuits, which, under one head, made men dispersed over the universe tend towards the same goal ; he fe lt tha t one could imitate their methods whilst holding view s diametrically opposed.\" 497 And again,"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"on the evidenc e of Mirabeau, de Luch et, and von K nigge, Barruel says elsewhere : \"It is here that Weishaupt appears speci ally to have wished to as similate the régi me of the sect to that of the rel igious orders and, above all, that of the Jesuits, b y the total abandon ment of the ir own will and j udgement which he dem ands of his adep ts ...\" But Barrue l goes on to show \"the enorm ous dif ference that is to be found be tween rel igious obedien ce and Illuminist obedien ce.\" In ever y relig ious order m en know tha t the voice of their consci ence and of their God is even more to be obe yed than tha t of their superiors. There is not a single one who, in th e event that his s uperiors s hould order hi m to do things contrar y to the dut ies of a Christi an or of a good m an, would not see an except ion to be ma de to the obedience which he has sworn. This except ion is often expressed and always clearly announced in all relig ious institu tions; i t is above all form al and positively repeated many times in th at of the Jesuits. They are ordered to obey their superiors, but it is in the even t that they see no sin in obe ying, ubi non cerner etur pecca tum (Const itution des Jesui tes , part 3, chap ter I, parag. 2, vol. i., édition de Prague). 498 Indeed, implicit obedien ce and the tot al surrender of one' s own will and j udgement for ms the foundation of all military disciplin e; \"th eirs not to reason wh y, theirs not to m ake reply\" is ever ywhere recognized as the dut y of soldiers. The Jesuits being in a sense a military Order , acknowl edging a General at their head, are bound b y the sa me obliga tion. Weishaupt's s ystem was som ething totally different. For whilst a ll soldiers and all Jesuits, when obe ying their superiors, are well aware of the goal towards which th ey are tending, Weishaupt's followers were en listed by the m ost subtle methods of decept ion and led on towards a goa l entir ely unkno wn to them . It is this tha t, as we shall see later, constitu tes the whole dif feren ce betwe en honest and dishone st secret societies. The fact is that the accusation of Je suit intrigu e behind secret socie ties has emanated princ ipally from the secre t societ ies the mselves and would appe ar to have been a device adopted by them to cover their own tra cks. No good evidence has ever been brought forward in support of their cont ention. The Jesuits, unlike the Templars and the Illuminati, were si mply suppressed in 1773 without the for mality of a tri al, and were therefore never giv en the opportuni ty to answer th e char ges brought against th em, nor, as in the case of these other Orders, were their secret statutes- -if an y such existed- -brought to light. The only document ever produced in proof of these ac cusations was the \"Monit a Secret a,\" long since shown to be a for gery. At an y rate, the correspondenc e of the Illuminati provides their best exoner ation. The Marquis de Luch et, who was no friend of the Jesuits, sho ws the absurdit y of confound ing their aims with those of ei ther the Freem asons or the Illuminati, and describes al l three as ani mated by wholly different purposes. 499 In all these questions it is necessar y to seek a motive. I have no personal inter est in defend ing the Jesuits, but I ask: what m otive could the Jesuits have in form ing or supporting a conspirac y direct ed against all thrones and al tars? It has been answered m e that the Jesuits at this period cared nothing for thrones and al tars, but onl y for te mpora l power; yet--even accept ing this unwarran table hypothesis--how wa s this power to be exercised exc ept through thrones and al tars? Was it not through princes and the Church that the Jesuits had been ab le to bring their influen ce to bear on af fairs of sta te? In an irreligious Republic, as events afterwards proved, the power of the whole cler gy was"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"bound to be destro yed. The truth is then, that, far fro m abe tting the Illuminati, the Jesuits were th eir m ost form idable opponents, th e only body of m en sufficiently learned, astut e, and well organiz ed to outwi t the schem es of Weishaupt. In suppressing the Jesuits i t is possible that th e Old Régi me removed the only barrier capabl e of resisting the tid e of revolu tion. Weishaupt indeed, as we know , detested the Jesuits, 500 and took from them only certain methods of discipl ine, of ensuring obedience or of acquir ing influ ence over the m inds of his discip les; his a ims were ent irely different. Where, then, did Weishaup t find his i mmediate inspirat ion? It is here tha t Barruel and Lecouteu lx de Cant eleu provide a clue not to be discover ed in other sources. In 1771, they relate, a certain Jutland merchant named Kölmer, who had spent many years in Egypt, returned to Europe in search of conver ts to a secret doctr ine founded on Manichæ ism that he had learnt in the East. On his wa y to France he stopped at Malta, where he met Cagliostro and nearl y brought about an insurrection amongst the people. Kölmer was therefore driven out of th e island by the Knights of Malt a and betook himself to Avignon and L yons. Here he m ade a few discip les amongst the Illu minés and in the same year went on to Germ any, where he encount ered Weishaupt and init iated him into all the mysteries of his secret doctr ine. According to Barruel, Weishaupt then spent five years th inking out his s ystem, which he founded under the name of Il luminati on Ma y 1, 1776, and assumed the \"il luminated\" name of \"Spart acus.\" Kölmer remains the m ost mysterious of al l the mystery men of his da y; at first sight one is inc lined to wonder whether he ma y not have been another of the Cabal istic Jews act ing as the secret inspirers of the m agicians w ho appe ared in the limelight. The name Kölmer might easi ly have been a corrupt ion of the well-known Jewish nam e Calm er. Lecou teulx de Canteleu, however , suggests that Kölmer was ident ical with Altolas, describ ed by Figuier as \"this universa l genius, al most divin e, of whom Cagl iostro has spoken to us with so much respect and adm iration. This Altot as wa s not an imaginary personage. The Inquisit ion of Ro me has colle cted many proofs of his existen ce withou t having been able to discover when it began or ended, for Altot as disappears, or rather vanishes lik e a meteor, which, according to the poeti c fanc y of rom ancers, would author ize us in declaring him immortal.\" 501 It is curious to notice that modern occu ltists, whilst attribut ing so mu ch importanc e to Saint-Ger main and the legend of his im mortality, make no m ention of Altotas, who appears to have been a grea t deal more remarkabl e. But, again, we m ust re member: \"It is th e unvar ying rule of secret societ ies that the real authors never show the mselves.\" If, then, Kölmer was the same person as Altot as, he would appear not to have been a Jew or a Cabalist, but an initiate of some Near Eastern secret socie ty--possibly an Is maili. Lecout eulx de Cantel eu describes Altotas as an Armenian, and says that his s ystem was derived from those of Eg ypt, Syria, and Persia. This would accord with Barrue l's state ment that Köl mer came from Egypt, and tha t his ideas were founded on M anichæism . It would be necessar y to set these stat ements aside as onl y the theori es of Barruel or Lecouteu lx, were it not tha t the writings of the Illuminati betra y the influ ence of some"},{"pageNumber":138,"pageContent":"sect akin to Manichæis m. Thus \"Sparta cus\" w rites to \"Cato\" that he is think ing of \"warming up the old system of the Ghebers and Parsees,\" 502 and it will be re membered that the Ghebers were one of the sects in which Doz y relates tha t Abdullah ibn Maymūn found his true supporters. Later Weishaup t goes on to exp lain that- - The allegor y in which the M ysteries and Higher G rades must be clo thed is Fire Worship and the whole phi losoph y of Zoroaster or of the old Parsees who nowada ys only remain in India; therefore in the further degrees the Order is cal led \"Fire Worship\" (Feuer - dienst), the \"Fire Order,\" or the \"Persian Order\"- -that is, something m agnific ent beyond all expec tation. 503 At the same time the Persian ca lendar was adopt ed by the Illuminati. 504 It is evident that this preten ce of Zoroastr ianism was as pure humbug as Weishaup t's later pretence of Christiani ty; of the true doctrines of Zoroaster he shows no concept ion--nor does he insist further on the point; but the above passage would cer tainly lend colour to the theor y that his s ystem was part ly founded on Manichæ ism, that is to sa y, on perverted Zoroastr ianism, imparted to him by a man from the East, and that the m ethods of the Batinis and Fat imites may have been communicated to hi m through the same chann el. Hence the extr aordinar y resem blance betwe en his plan of organization and th at of Abdullah ibn Ma ymūn, which consisted in politi cal intrigu ing rather than in esoteric specul ation. Thus in Weishaup t's system the phraseolog y of Judais m, the Cabalist ic legends of Freem asonr y, the mystical imaginings of the Martin istes, pla y at first no part at all. For all forms of \"theosoph y,\" occu ltism, spiritualism, and magic Weishaup t expresses nothing but cont empt, and the Rose-Croix ma sons are brack eted with the Jesuits b y the Illuminati as ene mies it is necessar y to outwit at ever y turn. 505 Consequent ly no degree of Rose-Croix finds a place in Weishaupt's s ystem, as in al l the other m asoni c orders of the day which drew their influenc e from East ern or Caba listic sources. It is true tha t \"Mysteries\" pla y a great part in the phraseolog y of the Order--\"Greater and Lesser M ysteries,\" borro wed from ancien t Egypt--whilst the higher in itiates are decorat ed with such titles as \"Epopte\" and \"Hierophant,\" taken from the E leusinian Mysteries. Yet Weishaupt's own theories appear to bear no rela tion whatever to these anc ient cults. On the contrar y, the m ore we penetr ate into his s ystem, the m ore apparent it beco mes tha t all the form ulas he employs which derive fro m any relig ious source--whether Persian, Egyptian, or Christian--m erely serve to disguise a purel y material purpose, a pl an for destro ying the ex isting order of society. Thus al l that was reall y ancient in Illuminism was the destruct ive spirit that animated it and also the m ethod of or ganiz ation it had im ported from the East. Illuminism therefore marks an entir ely new depar ture in the histor y of Europe an secret societ ies. Weishaup t himself indi cates this as one of the great secre ts of the Order . \"Above al l,\" he writes to \"Cato\" (a lias Zwack), \"guard the origin and the novel ty of ⊙ in the most carefu l way.\" 506 \"The grea test m ystery,\" he sa ys again, \"must be that the thing is new; the fewer who know this the bette r.... Not one of the Ei chstadters knows this but would liv e or die for it th at the thing is as old as Methuselah.\" 507"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"This pretence of having discover ed som e fund of anc ient wisdom is the inv ariabl e ruse of secre t societ y adepts; the one thing never admitted is the iden tity of the indiv iduals from whom one is receiving direc tion. Weishaupt himself declares that he has got it all out of books b y means of arduous and unrem itting labour . \"What it costs me to read, stud y, think, write, cross out, and re-write!\" he com plains to Marius and Ca to. 508 Thus, according to Weishaupt the whole system is the work of his own unaided genius, and the supre me direct ion re mains in his hands alon e. Again and again he insists on this point in his correspondenc e. If this were indeed the case, Weishaupt- -in view of th e efficiency achieved by the Order -- must have been a genius of the first water , and it is dif ficult to understand why so remarkable a man should not have distinguished hims elf on oth er lines, but have remained almost unkno wn to posterity. It would therefor e appear possible that Weishaupt, although undoubted ly a man of immense or ganiz ing capa city and endowed with extraofdinar y subtlety, was not in real ity the sole author of Illu minism, but one of a group, which, recognizing his tal ents and the value of his untiring activ ity, placed the direction in his hands. Let us exam ine this h ypothesis in the light of a docum ent which was unknown to me when I wrote my form er account of the Illu minati. Barrue l has pointed out tha t the great error of Robison wa s to describe Illuminism as arising out of Free masonr y, since Weishaupt did not beco me a Freemason unti l after he had founded his O rder. It is tru e that Weishaup t was not of ficially receiv ed into Freemasonr y until 1777, w hen he was initi ated into the first degre e at the Lodge \"Theodor e de Bon Conseil,\" at Munich. From this ti me we find him continually occupi ed in trying to discover m ore about the secrets of Free masonr y, whilst hi mself claiming superior knowledg e. But at the same time it is b y no m eans certa in tha t an inner circle of the Lodge Theodor e may not have been first in the fi eld and Weishaupt all the while an unconscious agen t. A very curious light is thrown on this question by the Mémoir es of Mirabeau. Now, in The Fr ench Re volution and again in World Revolu tion I quoted the genera lly received opinion tha t Mirabeau, who wa s already a Freemason, was received into the Order of the Illuminati during his visi t to Berl in in 1786. To this Mr. Waite repl ied: \"All that is said abou t Mirabeau, his visit to Berlin, and his plot to 'illu minize' French Freemasonr y, may be dispo sed of in one senten ce: there is no ev idence to sho w that Mirabe au ever beca me a Mason. The province of Barruel was to colour ever ything....\" 509 Mr. Waite's stat ement may also be disposed of in one sentence: it is a pure inven tion. The provinc e of Mr . Waite is to den y everything inconvenien t to him. The evidence that Mirabe au was a Freem ason does not rest on Barruel alone. M. Barthou, in his Lif e of Mirabe au, refers to it as a m atter of com mon knowledge, and relates that a paper was found at Mirabeau's house describing a new Order to be graft ed on Free masonr y. This document wil l be found in its entir ety in the Mémoir es of Mirabeau, where it is stat ed that:"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"Mirabe au had ear ly enter ed an associa tion of Freemasonr y. This af filiation had accredi ted him to a Dutch lodge, and it see ms th at, either spontan eousl y or in response to a request, he thought of proposing an or ganization of which we posse ss the plan, writt en not by his hand.... but b y the hand of a cop yist whom Mirabeau had attach ed to hims elf.... This work appears to have been that of Mirabeau ; all his opinions, his princ iples, and his st yle will be found here. 510 The same work goes on to print the docu ment in full, which is headed: \"Mem oir concerning an intimate association to be estab lished in the Order of Free masonr y so as to bring it back to its tru e princip les and to make it rea lly tend to the good of hum anity, drawn up b y the F. Mi----, at present named Arcesil as, in 1776.\" As this Mem oir is too long to reproduce in full here, M. Barthou's résumé will serve to give an idea of its cont ents 511 : He [Mirabeau] was a Freemason fro m his y outh. There was found a mongst his papers, written by the hand of a cop yist, an int ernation al organization of Free masonr y, which no doubt he dict ated in Amsterda m. This project contains on the solidari ty of m en, on the benef its of instruc tion, and on the \"correc tion of the s ystem of govern ments and of legislations\" views ver y superior to those of \"The Essa y on Despotism \" (1772). The mind of Mirabe au had ripen ed. The dut ies he tra ces out for the \"brothers of the higher grade\" consti tute even a whole plan of refor ms which resem ble very much in cert ain parts the work acco mplished later by the Consti tuent [Assem bly]: suppression of servitud es on the land and the rights of m ain morte, aboli tion of th e corvées, of working gui lds and of maîtrises [freedo m of co mpanies], of custo ms and excise dut ies, the diminution of taxation, liber ty of relig ious opinions and of the press, the disappe arance of special jurisdiction. In order to organize, to develop and arrive at his end, Mirabeau invokes the example of the Jesuits: \"We have quite contrar y views,\" he sa ys, \"tha t of enl ighten ing men, of ma king them free and happ y, but we m ust and we can do this b y the sam e means, and who should preven t us doing for good what the Jesuits have done for evil?\" 512 Now in this Me moir Mirabeau makes no m ention of Weishaupt, but in his Histoir e de la Monar chic Prussienne he gives a eulogisti c accoun t of the Bavarian Illuminati, referring to Weishaupt by name, and sho wing the Order to have arisen out of Freem asonr y. It will be seen that this accoun t corresponds point by point with the Me moir he had hi mself made out in 1776, that is to sa y, in th e very year that Illuminism was founded: The Lodge Theodore de Bon Conseil at Munich, where there were a few m en with brains and hearts, was tired of being tossed about by the vain prom ises and quarre ls of Ma sonry. The heads resolved to graft on to their branch another secret association to which the y gave the na me of the Order of the Illu minés. They modelled it on the Society of Jesus, whilst propo sing to the mselves views dia metrically opposed. Mirabe au then goes on to sa y that the grea t object of the Order wa s the amelioration of the present s ystem of governm ent and legisl ation, that one of its funda mental rules was to admit \"no prince whatev er his virtu es,\" 513 that it proposed to abol ish--"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"The slaver y of the peasants, the servitude of me n to the soil, the rights of m ain morte and all the custom s and privi leges which abase hu manity, the corvées under the condi tion of an equitab le equiv alent, all the corporations, al l the maîtrises, all the burden s imposed on industr y and com merce by customs, excise duties, and tax es ... to procure a universal toleration for al l relig ious opinions ... to take awa y all the ar ms of superstit ion, to favour the liber ty of the press, etc. 514 From all this we s ee then tha t Mirabeau did not becom e an Illu minatus in 1786 as I had supposed before th is docum ent was known to m e, but had been in th e Order from the beginn ing apparen tly as one of its founders, first under the \"Illu minated\" na me of Arcesil as and lat er under tha t of Leon idas. The Me moir found at his hou se was thus no other than th e progra mme of the Illuminati evolved by him in coll aboration with an inner ring of Freemasons belonging to the Lodge Theodore. The correspondenc e of the Illuminati in fact contains severa l refer ences to an inner ring under the name of \"the secre t chapt er of the Lodge of St. Theodore,\" which, aft er his ini tiation into Masonr y, Weishaupt indica tes the necessit y of bring ing ent irely under the con trol of Il luminism. It is probabl e that Weishaupt was in touch with this secre t chap ter before his form al admission to the lodge. Whether, then, the ideas of Illu minism arose in this secret, chap ter of th e Lodge Theodor e indep endent ly of Weishaupt, or whether they were imparted by Weishaupt to the Lodge Theodor e after the dir ections had been given him by Kölmer, it is impossible to know; but in eith er case there would be some justifi cation for Robison' s assertion that Illuminism arose out of Free masonr y, or rather that it took birth amongst a group of Freemasons whose ai ms were not those of the Order in genera l. What were these aims? A plan of social and politi cal \"reform \" which, as M . Barthou points out, mu ch resembled the work acco mplished later by the Constitu ent Assembly in France. This adm ission is of grea t impor tance; in other words, the progra mme carried out by the Constituen t Assembly in 1789 had been largely formu lated in a lodge of Ger man Freemasons who for med the nucl eus of the Il luminati, in 1776. And y et we are told that Illuminism had no influ ence on the French Revo lution! It will be objected that the reforms here indi cated were wholl y admirable. True, the abolition of the corvée , of main morte , and of servitudes were measures tha t met with the approva l of al l right- minded men, inc luding th e King of France hims elf. But what of the abolition of the \"working gui lds\" and \"all the corporations,\" tha t is to say, the \"trad e unions\" of the period, which was carr ied out by the infa mous Loi Chapelier in 1791, a decree tha t is now general ly recogn ized as one of the strangest anom alies of the Revolu tion? Again, to whose int erest was it to do awa y with the custo ms and excise duties of France? To estab lish the absolute and unfetter ed lib erty of the press and religious opinions? The benefi ts these m easur es mi ght be expec ted to confer on the French people were certain ly proble matical, but ther e could be no doubt of the ir utility to men who, like Freder ick the Great, wished to ruin France and to break the Franco- Austrian alliance by the unrestric ted circula tion of libels against Marie Antoine tte, who,"},{"pageNumber":142,"pageContent":"like Mirabeau, hoped to bring about a revolution, or who, like Voltair e, wished to re move all obstac les to the spread of an ant i-Christi an propaganda.

Whether this was so or not, the fact remains th at fro m the ti me Weishaupt assumed contro l of the Order the plan of \"social reform \" describ ed by Mirabeau vanishes entir ely, for not a word do w e find in the writings of the Illuminati about an y pretended schem e for ameliorating the lot of the people, and Illuminism beco mes simply a schem e of anarchic philosoph y. The French historian Henri Martin has thus ad mirably summed up the system elabor ated by \"Spartacus\": Weishaupt had m ade into an absolute theor y the misanthropi c gibes [boutades ] of Rousseau at the inven tion of propert y and socie ty, and without tak ing into account the statement so distinct ly formulated by Rousseau on the i mpossibi lity of suppre ssing propert y and societ y once th ey had been established, he proposed as the end of Illuminism the abolit ion of propert y, social authorit y, of nat ionali ty, and the return of the human race to the happ y state in which it form ed onl y a single family without artifi cial needs, withou t useless sciences, every father being priest and m agistrate. Priest of we know not what religion, for in spite of their frequent invo cations of the God of Nature, many indic ations le ad us to conc lude tha t Weishaupt had, like Diderot and d'Holbach, no other God than Nature herself. From his doctr ine would natur ally follow the Germ an ultra-Hegel ianism and the s ystem of anarch y recently developed in France, of w hich the physiogno my suggests a fore ign origin. 515 This summary of the aims of the Illuminati, which absolut ely corroborates the view of Barrue l and Robison, is confir med in deta il by the Social ist Freeth inker of the ninet eenth century Louis Bl anc, who in his re markable chapt er on the \"Révolutionn aires M ystiques\" refers to Weishaup t as \"One of the profoundest conspirators who have ever existed.\" 516 George Sand also, Socialist and intime of the Freem asons, wrote of \"the European conspira cy of Illu minism\" and the immense influenc e exerc ised b y the secret socie ties of \"mystic Ger many.\" To say, then, tha t Barruel and Robison were alon e in proclai ming the danger of Illu minism is simply a del iberate perversion of the tru th, and i t is dif ficult to understand why English Free masons should have allowed themselv es to be m isled on this question. Thus the Masonic Cyclopæd ia observes tha t the Illuminati \"were, as a rule, men of the strictest m orality and hu manity, and the ideas the y sought to instil were those which have found universa l acceptanc e in our o wn ti mes.\" Preston, in his Illustrat ions of Masonry , also does his best to gloss over the faults of the Order, and even \"the histori an of Freemasonr y\" devotes to its founder this astound ing apolog y. After describing Weishaupt as the victim of Jesuit intrigue, Mr. Gould goes on to sa y:"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"He conce ived the idea of co mbating his foes with their own weapons, and for ming a socie ty of young m en, enthusiasti c in th e cause of hu manity, who s hould graduall y be trained to work as one man to one end--the destruction of evil and the enhance ment of good in this world. Unfortunate ly he had unconsciousl y imbibed tha t most pernicious doctr ine th at the end ju stifies the means, and his w hole plan reve als the effects of his youthful teaching.... The man himself was without gui le, ignoran t of m en, knowing the m only by book s, a learned profes sor, an enthusiast who took a wrong course in all innoc ence, and the fau lts of his head have been heavil y visited upon his me mory in spite of the rare qual ities of his heart. 517 One can only conclud e that these extraordinar y exonera tions of an Order bit terly hostile to the true aims of Masonr y proceed from ignoranc e of the real nature of Il luminism. In order to judge of this it is onl y necessar y to consult the writings of the Illuminati themselves, which are conta ined in the fol lowing work s: 1. Einige Originalschri ften des Illuminatenor dens (Munich, 1787). 2. Nachtrag von weitern Originalschri ften, etc. (Muni ch, 1787). 3. Die neuesten Arbeiten des Spartacus und Phi lo in dem Il luminaten- Orden (Muni ch, 1794). All these consist in the correspondenc e and papers of the Order which were seized b y the Bavar ian Govern ment at the houses of two of the members, Zwack and Bassu s, and published by order of the Elec tor. The authen ticity of these docum ents has never been denied even by the Illu minati themselves; Weishaup t, in his publ ished defenc e, endeavoured onl y to expla in awa y the most incr iminating passages. The publishers, moreov er, were car eful to state at the beginning of the first volum e: \"Those who mi ght have any doubts on the authent icity of this col lection m ay present them selves at the Secre t Archiv es here, where, on request, the orig inal docum ents will be l aid before them.\" This precaution rendered all dispute i mpossibl e. Setting Barrue l and Robison ent irely aside, we shall now s ee from the evidence of their own writings, how far the Illuminati can be regarded as a praiseworth y and crue lly maligned Order. Let us begin with their attitude towards Free masonr y. I LLU MINIS M AND F REE MASON RY From the moment of Weishaupt's adm ission in to Free masonr y his w hole conduct was a violation of the Masonic code. Instead of proceeding after the recogni zed m anner b y successive stages of init iation, he set hims elf to find out furth er secrets b y underhand methods and then to turn the m to the advan tage of his o wn system. Thus about a year after his ini tiation he writes to Cato (alias Zwack): \"I have succeeded in obta ining a profound gli mpse into the secre t of the Freem asons. I know their whole aim and shall impart it all at the right time in one of the higher degrees.\" 518"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"Cato is then depu ted to make furth er discoveri es through an Ita lian Freem ason, the Abbé Marott i, which he records triu mphantly in his diar y: Interv iew with th e Abbé Marott i on the question of Masonr y, when he expl ained to m e the whole secret, which is founded on old religion and Church histor y, and i mparted to me all the higher degrees up to the Scott ish. Inform ed Spartacus of this. 519 Sparta cus, ho weve r, unimpressed by this co mmunication, repl ied drily: Whether y ou know the aim of Masonr y I doubt. I have myself included an insight into this structure in my plan, but reserved i t for la ter degre es. 520 Weishaupt then dec ides that all illuminated \"Areopagi tes\" shall take the first thr ee degre es of F reemasonr y 521 ; but furth er: That we shall have a m asoni c lodge of our o wn. That we shall regard this as our nurser y garden. That to some of these Masons we s hall not at once reveal that we have som ething more than th e Mason s have. That a t ever y opportunit y we shal l cover ourselves with this [Masonr y].... All those who are not suited to the work shall remain in th e masonic Lodge and advance in that without knowing an ything of the further system. 522 We shall find this plan of an inner secret circle concea led within Free masonr y persisting up to our o wn da y. Weishaupt, howeve r, admits himself puzzled with regard to the past of Masonr y, and urges \"Porcius\" to find out m ore on this question from the Abbé Marotti : See whether through hi m you can discover the real histor y, origin, and the first founders of Masonr y, for on this alon e I am still undecided. 523 But it is in \"Philo,\" the Baron von Knigge, a Free mason and m ember of the Stride Observance, in which he was known as the Eques a Cygno, that Weishaupt finds his mos t efficient investig ator. Thus \" Philo\" writes to \"Spart acus\": I have now found in Cassel the best man, on who m I canno t congra tulate ourselves enough: he is Mauvil lon, Grand Master of one of the Royal York Lodges. So with hi m we have the whole lodge in our hand s. He has also got from there all their miserab le degre es [ Er hat auch von dort aus alle ihre elenden Grade ]. 524 No wonder that Weishaup t thereupon excla ims jo yfully: \"Philo does m ore than we al l expected, and he is the man who alone will carr y it all through.\" 525 Weishaupt then occup ies hi mself in trying to get a \"Constitu tion\" fro m London, eviden tly without success, and also in wre sting the Lodge Theodore in Munich fro m the contro l of Berl in in order to sub stitute his o wn do mination, so that \"the whole secre t chap ter will be sub jected to our ⊙ , leave ever ything to it, and await further degrees from it alone.\" 526"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"In all this Weishaupt shows him self not onl y an intriguer but a char latan, inven ting mysteries and degre es to i mpose on the credu lity of his followers. \"The mysteries, or so- called secret tru ths, are the finest of a ll,\" he writes to \"Philipo Strozzi,\" \"and give me much trouble.\" 527 So whilst hear tily despising Free masonr y, theosoph y, Rosicruc ianism, and mysticism of ever y kind, his as sociation with Philo l eads hi m to perce ive the utility of all these as a bait, and he al lows P hilo to draw up plans for a degree of Scot tish Knight. But the result is pit iable, Philo's com position, a \"sem i-theosophica l discourse and explanation of hierogl yphics\" is chara cterized by Weishaupt as gibberish ( kauderwe lsche ). 528 Philo [he sa ys aga in] is full of such folli es, w hich betra y his sm all mind.... On the Illuminatus Ma jor follows the miserabl e degree of Scottish Knight entir ely of his composi tion, and on the degre e of Priest an equall y miserab le degre e of Regent, ... but I have alread y composed four m ore degrees co mpared to the worst of which the Priest's degre e will be child's pla y, but I shall tell no one about it till I see how the th ing goes.... 529 The perfid y of the Illuminati with regard to the Free masons is therefor e apparen t. Even Mounier , who set out to refut e Barruel on the strength of the inform ation supplied to hi m by the Illuminatus Bode, admits their duplici ty in th is respect. Weishaupt [says Mounier] m ade the acquain tance of a Hanoverian, the Baron von Knigge, a fam ous intr iguer , long practised in the charla tanism of lodges of Free masons. On his advic e new degrees were added to the old ones, and i t was resolved to profit b y Freemasonr y whilst profoundl y despising it. They decided that the degre es of Entered Apprenti ce, Fel low Craft, Master Mason, and Scotch Knight should be added to those of the Illuminati, and tha t they would boast of pos sessing exc lusivel y the rea l secrets of the Freemasons and affirm that Illuminism was the rea l primitive Free masonr y. \"The papers of the Order seiz ed in Bavaria and published,\" Mounier says aga in, sho w that \"the Illuminati emplo yed the forms of Freem asonr y, but that they consider ed it in itself, apar t from the ir own degrees, as a puerile absurdit y and that th ey detest ed the Rose-Croix.\" Mounier , as a good discip le of Bode, takes m uch the sa me view and pit ies the naïvet é of the Freem asons, who, \"like so many childr en, spend a grea t part of the ti me in their lodges pla ying at chap el.\" Why in the fac e of al l this should an y British Masons take up the cudgels for th e Illuminati and vilif y Robison and Barruel for exposing the m? The American Macke y, as a consisten t Free mason, shows scant s ympathy for this trai tor in the m asoni c camp. \"Weishaupt,\" he writes, \"was a radic al in polit ics and an infidel in rel igion, and he organiz ed this associa tion, not mo re for the purpose of aggrandi zing hi mself, than of overturn ing Christi anity and the institut ions of societ y.\" And in a footnote he adds that Robison's Proofs of a Con spiracy \"contain a ver y excellent exposi tion of the nature of this pseudo- mason ic inst itution.\" 530"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"The truth is th at Weishaupt was one of th e great est ene mies of Brit ish Freem asonr y who ever lived, and genuine Freem asons will do the mselv es no good b y defending him or his abominable system. Let us now s ee how far , apart from their rôle in Masonry, the Illu minati can be regarded as noble ideal ists striving for the welfare of the hum an race. I DEA LISM OF THE I LLUMINA TI The line of defence adopted by the apolog ists of the Illu minati is alwa ys to quote the admirable princip les professed b y the Order, the \"beau tiful ideas\" tha t run through their writings, and to show w hat excel lent people were to be found a mongst them. Of course on the ir face value the Illu minati appe ar wholl y admirable, of course th ere is nothing easier than to find innu merable passages in their writings breath ing a spiri t of the loftiest aspiration, and of course m any excel lent men figured amongst th e patrons of the Order . All th is is the m ere stock-in- trade of the secret societ y leader as of the fraudul ent company promoter, to whom the first essenti als are a glowing prospectus and a long list of highl y respectab le patrons w ho know nothing whatever about the inner workings of the concern. These methods, pursued as ear ly as the ninth cen tury by Abdull ah ibn Maymūn, enter lar gely into the polic y of Freder ick the Great, Voltaire, and his \"brothers\" in philosoph y--or in Free masonr y. The resem blances between Weishaup t's corresponden ce and that of Voltaire and of Frederi ck the Great are certa inly very striking. All at moments profes s respect for Christi anity whilst working to destroy it. Thus ju st as Voltair e in one letter to d'Ale mber t expresses his horror at the publi cation of an ant i-Christi an pa mphlet, Le Testamen t de Jean Meslier , 531 and in another urges him to have it circul ated in thousands all over France, 532 so Weishaup t is carefu l in general to exhibi t the face of a benign phi losopher and even of a Christi an evange list; it is onl y at moments th at he drop s the mask and reveals the grinning sat yr behind it. According ly in th e published statutes of th e Illu minati no hint of subversive int entions will be found; indeed the \"Obligat ion\" expressl y states that \"nothing aga inst the State, religion, or mor als is undertak en.\" Yet what is Weishaup t's real poli tical theor y? No other than that of mo dern Anarch y, that man should govern hi mself and rulers should be graduall y done awa y with. But he is careful to depreca te all ideas of violent revolut ion--the process is to be acco mplished by the most peac eful methods. Le t us see how gentl y he leads up to the fina l conclusion : The first stage in the life of th e whole hu man race is savager y, rough natur e, in which the family is the onl y socie ty, and hunger and thirst are easi ly satisfi ed, ... in which man enjoys the two m ost excell ent good s, Equa lity and Liber ty, to their fullest extent.... In these circu mstances ... hea lth was his usual condi tion.... Happ y men, who were not y et enough enlight ened to lose their peace of mi nd and to be conscious of th e unhapp y"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"mainsprings and causes of our m isery, love of po wer ... env y ... illnesses and a ll the results of im agination. The manner in which m an fell from this pri mitive stat e of fel icity is then described: As fam ilies incre ased, m eans of subsistenc e began to lack, the no madic life ce ased, propert y was inst ituted, m en established themselv es firm ly, and through agricul ture families drew near each other , thereb y language developed and through liv ing toge ther men began to measure th emselves against ea ch other , etc.... But here was the cause of the downfall of freedo m; equal ity vanished. Man felt new unkno wn needs.... 533 Thus m en beca me dependen t like minors under the guardi anship of kings; th e human must attain its m ajority and beco me self- governing: Why should i t be impossible tha t the hum an rac e should at tain to its highest perfect ion, the capac ity to guide i tself? Why should anyone be et ernally led who understands how to lead himself? 534 Further , men must learn not onl y to be independen t of kings but of each other : Who has need of another depends on hi m and has resigned his rights. So to need li ttle is the first step to freedo m; therefor e savages and the most highl y enligh tened are perhaps the only free men. The art of m ore and m ore limiting one's needs is at the same time the art of att aining freedo m.... 535 Weishaupt then goes on to show how the further evil of Patriotis m arose: With the origin of nations and peopl es the world ce ased to be a great family, a singl e kingdo m: the great tie of nature was torn.... Nation alism took the place of hum an lov e.... Now it bec ame a virtue to m agnify one's fatherl and at the expense of w hoever was not enclosed within its limits, now as a m eans to this narrow end it was allowed to despise and outwit foreign ers or indeed even to insul t them. This virtue was called Patriot ism.... 536 And so b y narrowing down af fection to one's fellow-ci tizens, the m embers of one's family, and even to oneself: There arose out of Patriotis m, Loca lism, the family spirit, and fina lly Egoism.... Di minish Patrio tism, then m en will l earn to know each other again as such, the ir dependen ce on each other will be lost, the bond of union will widen out.... 537 It will be seen that the whole of Weishaupt's theor y was in reali ty a new render ing of the ancient secret tr adition rela ting to the fa ll of m an and the loss of his pri mitive fel icity; but whilst the anc ient religions taught th e hope of a Redee mer who s hould restore man to his former state, Weishaupt looks to m an alone for his restoration. \"Men,\" he observes, \"no longer loved m en but onl y such and such me n. The word was quite lost....\" 538 Thus in Weishaupt's m asonic system the \"lost word\" is \" Man,\" and its recover y is interpr eted by"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":"the idea that Man s hould find hi mself again. Further on Weishaup t goes on to show ho w \"the redemption of the hum an race is to be brought about\". These means are secret schools of wisdo m, these were fro m all time the archiv es of Nature and of hu man rights, through the m will Man be saved fro m his Fall, princ es and nations will disappear without violen ce fro m the ear th, the hum an rac e will beco me one family and the world the abode of reasonab le men.

Ever y father of a fa mily will be, as for merly Abraha m and th e patriarchs, the priest and unfetter ed lord of his fam ily, and Reason wil l be the only code of Man. This is one of our greatest secrets.... 539 But whilst completely eliminating any idea of divine power outsid e Man and fra ming his system on purel y political lines, Weishaup t is carefu l not to shock the susceptib ilities of his followers by any open repudia tion of Christian doc trines; on the contr ary, he invok es Christ at ever y turn and som etimes even in langu age so apparen tly earnest and even beautiful that one is al most tempted to believ e in his sincer ity. Thus he w rites: This our great and unfo rgettable Master , Jesus of Nazareth, appeared at a time in the world when it was sunk in deprav ity.... The first fol lowers of Hi s teaching are not wise men but si mple, chosen fro m the lowest c lass of the peopl e, so as to sho w tha t His teaching should be pos sible and co mprehensibl e to a ll classes and conditions of me n.... He carr ies out this teach ing b y means of the m ost bl ameless life in conform ity with i t, and seals and confir ms this with His blood and dea th. These laws which He s hows as the way to salvation are onl y two: love of God and love of one's neighbour; m ore He asks of no one. 540 So far no Luth eran pastor could have expressed hi mself bette r. But one mus t stud y Weishaupt's writings as a whole to apprehend the tru e measure of his belief in Christ's teaching. Now, as we have alre ady seen, his first idea was to m ake Fire Worship the religion of Illuminism; the profes sion of Christian ity therefore appe ars to have been an af ter-thought. Evidently Weishaup t discovered, as others have done, that Christiani ty lends itself m ore readily to subversive ideas th an an y other relig ion. And in the passages which follow we find him adopt ing the old ruse of represent ing Christ as a Com munist and as a secret- socie ty adept. Thus he goes on to expl ain tha t \"if Jesus preaches conte mpt of riches, He wishes to te ach us the reasonable use of th em and prepare for the community of good s introdu ced b y Him,\" 541 and in which, Weishaupt adds la ter, He lived with His disc iples. 542 But this secret doctrine is onl y to be apprehended by initiates: No one ... has so clever ly conce aled the high meaning of His teaching, and no one fin ally has so surel y and easi ly directed men on to the path of freedo m as our grea t master Jesu s of Nazare th. This secre t meaning and natural consequence of Hi s teaching He hid completely, for J esus had a secre t doctrin e, as we see in more than one plac e of the Scriptur es. 543"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"Weishaupt thus contrives to give a purel y political interpret ation to Christ's teach ing: The secret preserved through the Disciplin am Arcani, and the ai m appear ing through a ll His word s and deeds, is to give back to m en their origina l liberty and equali ty.... Now one can understand how far Jesu s was the Redee mer and Saviour of the world. 544 The mission of Christ was therefor e by means of Reason to m ake men capable of freedo m 545 : \"When at last reason beco mes the rel igion of m an, so will the proble m be solved.\" 546 Weishaupt goes on to sho w tha t Free masonr y can be in terpret ed in the sa me manner. The secre t doctrin e conce aled in the teach ing of Christ was handed down by initiates who \"hid themselv es and their doctrin e under the cover of Free masonr y,\" 547 and in a long explanation of Masonic hierog lyphics he indica tes the analogi es between th e Hira mic legend and the story of Christ. \"I sa y then Hiram is Christ,\" and after giving one of his reasons for this assertion, adds: \"Here then is mu ch ground gained, al though I m yself canno t help laughing at this explanat ion [ obwohl ich selbst über diese Explication im Grund lachen mus s ].\" 548 Weishaup t then proceeds to give further interpre tations of his own devising to the m asonic ritu al, including an imaginary translat ion of cert ain words supposed to be der ived fro m Hebrew , and ends up b y saying: \"One will be abl e to show severa l more resem blanc es between Hiram and th e life and dea th of Christ, or drag them in by the hai r.\" 549 So mu ch for Weishaupt's respect for th e Grand Legend of Freem asonr y! In this manner Weishaupt demonstrat es that \"Freemasonr y is hidden Christian ity, at least my explana tions of the hierogl yphics fit th is perfect ly; and in the way in which I expl ain Christi anity no one need be asham ed to be a Christ ian, for I le ave th e name and sub stitute for it Reason.\" 550 But this is of course onl y the secret of w hat Weishaupt ca lls \"real Free masonr y\" 551 in contr adistin ction to the official kind, which he regards as tota lly unen lighten ed: \"Had not the noble and elect remained in the background ... new depravi ty would have broken out in the hu man race, and through Regents, Priests, and Freem asons Reason would have been banished fro m the ear th.\" 552 In Weishaupt's ma sonic system, therefor e, the designs of the Order with regard to rel igion are not confided to the mere Freemasons, but onl y to the Il luminati. Under the head ing of \"Higher Mysteries\" Weishaupt writes: The man who is good for nothing better remains a Scottish Knight. If he is, however , a particularly industr ious co-ordinator [ Sammler ], observer , worker , he beco mes a Priest.... If ther e are amongst these [Priests] high speculat ive intel lects, they beco me Magi. These collect and put in order the higher phi losophical system and work at the People's Religion, which the Order will next give to th e world. Should these high geniuses also be fit to rule the world, th ey beco me Regents. This is the last degree. 553"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"Philo (the Baron von K nigge) also throws an inter esting l ight on th e relig ious designs of the Illuminati. In a le tter to Cato he expla ins the nec essity of devising a system that will satisf y fanatics and freeth inkers alik e: \"So as to work on both th ese classes of m en and unite them, we m ust find an explan ation to the Christian religion ... ma ke this the secret of Free masonr y and turn i t to our purpose.\" 554 Philo cont inues: We say then: Jesus wished to in troduce no new religion, but onl y to restore natur al religion and reason to the ir old rights. Thereb y he wished to unite men in a great universa l associat ion, and through the spread of a wi ser morality, enlighten ment, and the combating of all prejudic es to m ake them capab le of governing themselves; so the secret meaning of his t eaching was to lead men without revolut ion to univ ersal lib erty and equality. There are m any passages in the Bibl e which can be m ade use of and expl ained, and so all quarrel ling between the sects ceases if one can find a reasonabl e meaning in the teaching of Je sus--be it true or not. As, ho wever , this si mple religion was afterwards distort ed, so were these teachings imparted to us through Discip linam Arcani and fina lly through Freemasonr y, and all m asonic hierog lyphics can be expl ained with this object. Sparta cus has colle cted very good data for this and I have myself added to the m, ... and so I have got both degrees ready.... Now therefore that people see that we are the only real and true Christians, we can say a word mo re against priests and princes, but I have so ma naged that after previous tests I can receiv e pontif fs and kings in this degree. In the higher M ysteries we m ust then ( a ) disclose the pious fraud and ( b ) reveal from all writings th e origin of all religious lies and their connex ion.... 555 So ad mirably did this ruse succeed that we find Spartacus writ ing triu mphant ly: You cannot imagine what consideration and sensation our P riest's degre e is arousing.

Oh! men, of w hat cannot you be persuaded? I never thought th at I should beco me the founder of a new religion. 556 It is on the \"il luminized\" clergy and profes sors that Weishaup t counts princ ipally for the work of the Order. Through the influ ence of the Brothers [he writes], the Jesuits have been re moved fro m all professorships, and the Universit y of Ingoldstadt has been quit e cleansed of the m.... 557 Thus the way is clear ed for Weishaupt's adepts.

If only the ai m is achi eved, i t does not m atter under what cover it takes plac e, and a cover is always necessar y. For in conce alment lies a great part of our strength. For this reason we must alwa ys cover ourselves with the na me of anoth er societ y.

Yet if we are to bel ieve his o wn assertions, he had been throughou t in supre me contro l. Again and again he impresses on his intimes the nec essity for unit y of com mand in the Order: \"One m ust show how eas y it would be for one clev er head to direc t hundreds and thousands of m en,\" 576 and he illustr ates this system by the table reproduced on the next page, to which he appends the following expl anation : I have two im mediately below me into whom I breath e my whole spirit, and each of these two has aga in two others, and so on. In this way I can set a thousand men in motion and on fire in the simplest manner, and in this way one mus t impart orders and operate on politics. 577 Thus, as in th e case of Abdullah ibn Maymūn's socie ty, \"the extraord inary result was brought about tha t a multitude of m en of divers bel iefs were al l working togeth er for an object known onl y to a few of the m.\" Enough has no w been quoted fro m the correspondenc e of the Illuminati to show their aims and m ethods according to the ir own adm issions.

What a wonderful mix-up [ mischmasch ]! 588 So m uch for w hat Mr. Gould cal ls the \"rare quali ties\" of Weishaupt's heart. Let us now listen to the test imony of Weishaupt's princip al coadjutor , Philo (the Baron von Knigge), to whom the \"histori an of Free masonr y\" refers as \"a lovabl e enthusiast.\" In all subver sive associa tions, whether open or secret, directed by men who aim at power, a moment is certain to arrive when the a mbitions of the le aders co me into conf lict. This is the histor y of ever y revolut ionar y organiz ation during the last 150 y ears. It wa s when the inevi table climax had been reached between Weishaupt and K nigge that \"Philo\" wrote to \"the most loving Cato\" in the fol lowing ter ms: It is not Mahom ed and A. who are so mu ch to blam e for m y break with Spartacus, as the Jesuiti cal conduct of this ma n which has s o often turned us against each other in order to rule despotica lly over me n, who, if th ey have not perhaps such a rich imagination as himself, also do not possess s o much cuten ess and cunning, et c. 589 In a further le tter Philo goes on to enu merate the services he has rendered to Weishaupt in the past: At the bidding of Spartacus I have written aga inst ex- Jesuits and Rosicrucians, persecu ted peopl e who never did me any harm, thrown the Stricte Observance into confusion, drawn the best a mongst them to us, told the m of the worthiness of ⊙ , of its power, its age, the excellence of i ts Chiefs, the blamelessnes s of its higher le aders, the importan ce of its knowledge, and given great id eas of the uprightness of its views; those amongst us who are now working so act ively for us but cling much to religiousness [ sehr an Rel igiositä t kleben ] and who feared our inten tion was to spread Deism, I have sought to persuade that the higher Superiors had nothing less than this int ention.

To make the case complete it would be necessar y also to giv e a résu mé of the confessions m ade by the ex-Illu minati, the four profes sors Cosande y, Grünber ger, Utzschneider , and Renner , as also of the further published works of the Il luminati--but space and time forbid. What is needed is a complete book on the subject, consisting of transla tions of the most impor tant passages in all the conte mpor ary German publica tions. From the extra cts given above, can it, however , be seriousl y contend ed tha t Barruel or Robison exagg erated the gui lt of th e Order ? Do m y literal transla tions dif fer materially in sense fro m the transla tions and occ asional paraphrases given by the m uch-abused couple? Even those conte mporari es, M ounier and the member of the Illuminati 591 who set out to refute Barruel and Lo mbard de Langr es, me rely provide further confir mation of their views. Thus Mounier is oblig ed to confess tha t the real design of Illu minism was \"to under mine all civ il order ,\" 592 and \"Ancien Illuminé\" asserts in langu age no less forcib le than Barruel's own that Weishaupt \"made a code of Machi avellism,\" that his m ethod was \"a profound perversit y, flattering ever ything that was base and rancorous in hum an nature in order to arriv e at his ends,\" that he was not inspired b y \"a wise spiri t of refor m\" but b y a \"fanatic al enmity inimical to all author ity on ear th.\" The only essentia l points on which the opposing parti es dif fer is tha t whilst Mounier and \"Ancien Il luminé\" deny the influence of the Illu minati on the French Revolu tion and ma intain that they ceased to exist in 1786, Barrue l and Lo mbard de L angres present th em as the inspirers of the Jacobins and declar e them to be still active after the Revolu tion had ended. That on this point, at any rate, the la tter were right, we shal l see in a further chap ter. The great question tha t presents itse lf after stud ying the writings of the Illuminati is: what was the m otive power behind the Order? If we adm it the possibil ity that Freder ick the Great and the Stricte Observanc e, working through an inner cir cle of Freem asons at the Lodge St. Theodore, may have provided the first i mpetus and tha t Köl mer initiated Weishaupt into Orient al methods of or ganiz ation, the source of inspir ation from which Weishaupt subsequent ly drew his anarch ic phi losoph y still remains obscure. It has frequen tly been suggested tha t his real inspirers were Jews, and the Jewish writer Bernard Lazare definit ely states that \"there were Je ws, Cabal istic Jews, around Weishaupt.\" 593 A writer in La Vieille France went so far as to designa te these Jews as Mo ses Mendelssohn, Wessely, and th e bankers Itz ig, Friedl ander , and Meyer. But no docum entary eviden ce has ever been produced in support of these state ments. It is ther efore nec essar y to exa mine them in the ligh t of probabi lity."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"Now, as I have alr eady shown, the theosophi cal ideas of the Cabala play no part in the system of Illu minism; the onl y trace of Cabalis m to be found a mongst the papers of the Order is a l ist of recip es for procuring abor tion, for m aking aphrodisi acs, Aqua Toffana, pestilential vapours, etc., head ed \"Caba la Major .\" 594 It is pos sible, then, that the Il luminati may have le arnt something of \"venef ic magic\" and the use of cer tain natura l substances from Jewish Caba lists; at the same time Jews appear to have been only in rare cases admitted to th e Order . Ever ything indeed t ends to prove tha t Weishaupt and his first coadjutors, Zwack and Mas senhausen, were pure Germ ans. Neverthe less there is between the ideas of Weishaupt and of Lessing' s \"Falk\" a distinc t rese mblance ; both in the writings of the Illu minati and in Lessing's Dialogues we find the sa me vein of iron y with regard to Free masonr y, the sa me design tha t it should be repla ced b y a more effectual system, 595 the same denunc iations of the exist ing socia l order and of bou rgeois society, the same theor y that \"men should be self-governing,\" the same plan of obliter ating all distin ctions between nat ions, even the same simile of the bee- hive as appl ied to hum an life 596 which, as I have shown elsewhere, was lat er on adopt ed by the anarchist Proudhon. It may, however , legit imately be ur ged tha t these ideas were those of th e inner mason ic circle to which both Lessing and Weishaupt belong ed, and th at, though placed in the mouth of Falk, the y were in no sense Judaic. But Lessing wa s also the friend and ad mirer of Moses M endelssohn, who has been suggested as one of Weishaupt's inspirers. Now , at first sight nothing seem s more improb able than tha t an orthodox Je w such as Mendelssohn should have accorded any sympathy to the anarchi c sche me of Weishaup t. Neverthe less, certa in of Weishaupt's doctr ines are not inco mpatible with the princ iples of orthodox Judaism. Thus, for example, Weishaupt's theor y--so strangel y at varian ce with his denuncia tions of the family system--that as a result of Il luminism \"the head of ever y family will be what Abraha m was, the patri arch, the priest, and the unfet tered lord of his fa mily, and Reason will be the only code of Man,\" 597 is essenti ally a Jewish conception. It will be objected that the patriarch al system as conceiv ed by orthodox Jews could b y no means include the religion of Reason as advocat ed by Weishaupt. It must not, however , be forgotten tha t to the Jewish mi nd the hum an race presents a dual aspec t, being divided into two distinc t categories- -the privi leged race to whom the pro mises of G od were m ade, and the great mass of hum anity which re mains outside the pal e. Whilst strict adherenc e to the commands of the Talmud and the laws of M oses is expect ed of the form er, the m ost indef inite of rel igious creeds suf fices for th e nations excluded from the privileg es that Jewish birth confers. It was thus that Moses Mendelssohn w rote to the pastor Lava ter, who had sought to win him over to Christian ity: Pursuant to the princ iples of m y religion, I am not to seek to convert anyone who is not born ac cording to our laws. This proneness to conversion, the origin of w hich some would fain tack on to the Jewish rel igion, is, never theless, diametrically opposed to it. Our rabbis unani mously teach tha t the written and oral l aws which form conjointl y our revealed religion are obl igator y on our nation only. \"Mo ses co mmanded us a law, even the inheri tance of the congreg ation of Jacob.\" We believ e that all other nations of the earth have been direc ted by God to adhere to the laws of nature, and to the rel igion of the"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"patriarchs. Those who regula te their lives accord ing to the precep ts of this religion of nature and of r eason 598 are called virtuous men of other nations and are the children of eternal salvation. 599 Our rabbis are so remote from Proselytomania, tha t they enjoin us to dissuade, b y forcible remonstrances, everyone who co mes forward to be convert ed. (The Talmud sa ys ... \"pro selytes are anno ying to Israel like a scab.\") 600 But was not this \"relig ion of nature and of reason\" the precise concept ion of Weishaupt? Whether, then, Weishaupt was direc tly inspired by Mendelssohn or an y other Jew must remain for th e present an open question. But the Jewish connexions of certa in other Illuminati cannot be disputed. The most import ant of th ese was Mirabeau, who arrived in Berlin just after th e death of Mendelssohn and was w elcomed by his disciples in the Jewish salon of Henriet ta Herz. It was these Jew s, \"arden t supporters of the French Revolu tion\" 601 at its outset, who preva iled on Mirabeau to write his great apolog y for their race under the form of a paneg yric of Mendelssohn. To sum up, I do not so far see in Illu minism a Jewish conspira cy to destro y Christiani ty, but rather a movement finding its princ ipal dynamic force in the anc ient spirit of revol t against the existing social and moral order , aided and abet ted perhaps b y Jews who sa w in it a system that might be turned to their own advan tage. Meanwhile, Illuminism made use of ever y other m ovement that could serve i ts purpo se. As the conte mporar y de Luchet has expressed it : The system of the Illuminés is not to embrace the dog mas of a sect, but to turn a ll errors to its advant age, to concentra te in itself everything that men have invent ed in th e way of dupli city and i mpostur e. More than this, Illu minism was not only the assemblage of all error s, of a ll ruses, of all subtle ties of a theoret ic kind, it was also an assemblage of all prac tical methods for rousing m en to ac tion. For in th e word s of von Ha mmer on the Assassins, that cannot be too often repea ted: Opinions are powerless s o long as the y only confuse the brain without ar ming the hand. Scept icism and free- thinking as long as the y occup ied onl y the m inds of the indol ent and philosophi cal have caused the ruin of no throne.... It is nothing to the a mbitious m an what peopl e believe, but it is ever ything to know ho w he may turn them for th e execu tion of his projects. This was what Weishaupt so admirably understood; he knew ho w to take fro m every associa tion, past and present, the portions he required and to weld the m all into a working system of terribl e efficiency--the disint egrating doctrin es of the Gnostics and Manich eans, of the mod ern philosophers and Encyclopæd ists, the m ethods of the Ismailis and the Assassins, the disciplin e of the Jesuits and Templars, th e organiza tion and secrec y of the Freem asons, the philosoph y of Machiave lli, the mystery of the Rosicrucians--he knew m oreov er, how to enl ist the right el ements in al l existing associat ions as well as isolated ind ividua ls and turn the m to his purpo se. So in the ar my of the Illu minati we find"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"men of ever y shade of thought, fro m the poet Goethe 602 to the meanest intrigu er--loft y idealists, socia l refor mers, visionaries, and at th e sam e time the a mbitious, the rancorous, and the disgruntl ed, m en swayed by lust or em bittered by grievanc es, all these dif fering in their aims yet by Weishaupt's ad mirable system of water tight compartments precluded from a knowledge of these differenc es and all marching, unconsciousl y or not, towards the same goal. Although this was not the inv ention of Weishaupt but had been foreshadowed m any centuries ear lier in the East, it was Weishaupt, so far as we kno w, who reduced it to a working s ystem for the West--a system which has been adhered to by succeed ing groups of world-revolu tionar ies up to the present da y. It is for this reason that I have quoted at length the writings of the Illuminati--all the ruses, all the hypocrisy, all the subtl e methods of ca mouf lage which charac terized the Order will be found again in the insidious propaganda both of the m odern secret societies and the open revolut ionar y organiz ations whose object is to subvert all order , all morality, and al l religion. I maintain, therefor e, with greater convict ion than ever the importance of Illu minism in the histor y of world-revolu tion. But for this co-ordina tion of me thods the philosophers and Encyclopæd ists mi ght have gone on for ever inveigh ing aga inst thrones and altars, the Martinist es evoking spirits, the m agicians weaving spells, the Free masons decl aiming on universa l brotherhood- -none of these would have \"armed the hand\" and driven th e infuri ated mobs into th e streets of Paris; it was not unt il the emissari es of Weishaup t formed an al liance with th e Orléanist e lead ers that vague subversive th eory beca me active revolution. 10. T HE C LIMAX The first Masonic bod y with which the Il luminati form ed an alliance was the Stricte Observance, to which the Illuminati Knigge and Bode both belonged. Cagliostro had also been initiated into the Stric te Observance near Frankfurt and wa s now e mployed as agen t of the combined order . According to his own confes sion his mi ssion \"was to work s o as to turn Freemasonr y in th e direc tion of Weishaupt's projects\"; and the funds he drew upon were those of the Illu minati. 603 Cagl iostro also for med a link with the Martinist es, w hose doctr ines, though der ided b y Weishaupt, were useful to his plan in attracting b y their mystical charac ter those who would have been repe lled by the c ynicism of th e Illu minati. According to Barruel, it was the Martinistes who--following in the footsteps of the Rosicruc ians--had suggested to Weishaup t the device of presenting Christ as an \"Illuminatus\" which had led to such triu mphant results a mongst the Protestan t clergy.

Thus at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad convened on Jul y 16, 1782, and at tended by representat ives of m asonic bodies from all over the world, the first question propounded b y the Grand Ma ster of the Templars (i.e. the Stric te Observance) was: \" What is the real obj ect of the Order and i ts true origin ?\" So, sa ys Mirabe au in rel ating this inc ident, \"this sam e Grand Master and all his assistants had worked for mor e than twent y years with incred ible ardour at a thing of which they knew neith er the real object nor the orig in.\" 604 Two years later the Freemasons of France do not appear to have been any less in the dark on this matter, for we find them writing to Genera l Rainsford, one of the Engl ish Mason s who had been present at the Congress of Wilhelmsbad, as follows: Since you say that Masonry has never experien ced an y variat ion in i ts aim, do you then know with cer tainty what this unique object is? I s it useful for the happiness of mankind?... Tell us if it is of an historic al, pol itical, herm etical, or scient ific nature?... Moral, social, or rel igious? ... Are the trad itions oral or writt en? 605 But Weishaupt had a ver y definit e object in view , which was to gain control of all Freemasonr y, and though he him self was not present at the Congress, his coadjutor Knigge, who had been trave lling about Ger many procla iming himself the refor mer of Freemasonr y, presented himself at Wilhelmsbad, armed with full authorit y from Weishaupt, and succeeded in enrol ling a num ber of m agistrates, savants, eccl esiasti cs, and ministers of sta te as Illu minati and in all ying himself with the deput ies of Saint- Martin and Willermoz. Vanquished b y this powerful riva l, the Strict e Observan ce ce ased temporari ly to ex ist and Illu minism was left in possession of the field. On Februar y 15, 1785, a furth er congress took pla ce in Paris, convened th is time by the Phila lèthes, at which the Illu minati Bode (alias Amelius) and the Baron de Busche (ali as Bayard) were present, a lso--it has been stated- -the \" magician\" Cagliostro, the m agnetiser Mesm er, the Caba list Duchant eau, and of course the le aders of the Philalèthes, Saval ette de Langes, who wa s elected President, the Marquis de Chefdeb ien, and a num ber of German members of the sa me Order. This congress led to no ver y pract ical results, and a further and m ore secret one was conven ed in the following year at Frankfur t, where a Grand Lodge had been established in 1783. It was here tha t the deaths of Lou is XVI and Gustavus III of S weden are said to have been decreed. But alread y in this sa me year of 1785 the first ac t of the revolution ary drama had been played out. The famous \"Af fair of the Necklace\" can never be understood in the pages of official histor y; only an exa mination of the mechanis m provided by the secret societ ies can explain that extraord inary episode, which, in the opinion of Napoleon, contr ibuted more than an y other cause to the explosion of 1789.

An evange list preacher and Illuminatus na med Lanz e had been sent in Jul y 1785 as an emissary of the Illuminati to Silesia, but on his journe y he was struck down b y lightning. The instruc tions of the Order were found on hi m, and as a result its intrigu es were conclusiv ely revealed to the Governm ent of Bavari a. 608 A search ing enquir y followed, the houses of Zwack and Bassus w ere raided, and it was then that the docu ments and other incri minating evid ence referr ed to in the prec eding chap ter of th is book were seized and m ade public under the name of The Original Writings of the Or der of the Illuminat i (1787). But before this th e evidence of four ex-Illu minati, professor s of Munich, was published in two separat e volumes. 609 The diabol ical nature of Illu minism now re mained no long er a m atter of doubt, and the Order was of ficially suppressed. The opponents of Barruel and Robison therefore declar e that Illuminism came final ly to an end. We shall see l ater by docum entary eviden ce tha t it never ceased to exist, and that twent y-five years later not onl y the Illu minati but Weishaupt himself were still as activ e as ever behind the scenes in Free masonr y. But for the present we must follow its course from the moment of its appar ent ext inction in 1786. This course can be traced not onl y through the \"Ger man Union,\" which is believed to have been a reor ganization of the original Illuminati, but through the secre t socie ties of France. Illuminism in real ity is less an Order th an a princ iple, and a princ iple which can work better under cover of something else. Weishaupt hi mself had l aid down the precept that the work of Illu minism could best be conducted \"under other names and other occupat ions,\" and hencefor th we shall alwa ys find it carri ed on b y this skilfu l system of cam ouflag e. The first cover adopted was the lodge of the \"Amis Réunis\" in Paris, with which, as we have alread y seen, the Illuminati had establ ished rel ations. But now in 1787 a defini te alliance was ef fected by the aforem entioned Illuminati, Bode and Busche, who in response to an invita tion from the secret committee of the lodge arrived in Paris in Februar y of this y ear. Here the y found the old Il luminatus Mirabeau- -who with Talleyrand had been lar gely instru mental in su mmoning these Germ an Brothers--and, according to Gustave Bord, 610 two i mpor tant members of the Stric te Observance, the Marquis de Chefdeb ien d'Arm isson ( Eques a Capite Galeato ) and an Austrian, the Com te Leopo ld de Kollowra th-Krakow ski ( Eques ab Aquila Fulgen te ) who also belong ed to Weishaupt's Order of Illu minati in which he bore the pseudon ym of Num enius. It is im portan t here to recogni ze the pecul iar part played by the Lodge of the Amis Réunis . Whilst th e Loge des Neuf Soeur s was lar gely composed of m iddle- class revolu tionar ies such as Brissot, Danton, Ca mille Desmou lins, and Cha mpfort, and the"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"Loge de la Candeur of aristocra tic revolut ionaries- -Lafa yette as wel l as the Orléanistes, the Marquis de Sill ery, the Duc d'Aigui llon, the Marquis de Custine, and the Lam eths-- the Loge du Contrat Socia l was ma inly composed of honest visionari es who ent ertained no revolu tionar y projects but, accord ing to Barrue l, were strongl y Royalist. The rôle of the \"Am is Réunis\" was to coll ect together the subversives fro m all other lodges-- Phila lèthes, Ro se-Croix, m embers of the Loge des Neuf Sours and of the Loge de la Candeur and of the m ost secre t committees of the Grand O rient, as well as deputies from the Illuminés in the provinc es. Here, then, a t the lodge in the Rue de la Sordière, under the direc tion of Saval ette de Lang es, were to be found the discip les of Weishaupt, of Swedenbor g, and of Saint- Martin, as wel l as the practic al makers of revolut ion--the agitators and demagogues of 1789. The influenc e of Ger man Illuminism on al l these heterogen eous ele ments was enorm ous. From this mo ment, says a further Bavar ian repor t of the matter, a complete chang e took place in the Order of the \"Amis Réunis.\" Hitherto only vague ly subversive, the Cheva liers Bienf aisants bec ame the Cheva liers Malfa isants, the Amis Réunis bec ame the Enne mis Réunis. The arrival of the two G ermans, Bode and Busche, gave the fin ishing touch to the conspirac y. \"The avowed object of their journe y was to obta in infor mation about magnetism, which was just then m aking a grea t stir,\" but in rea lity, \"taken up with the gigant ic plan of their Order ,\" their real aim was to make prosel ytes. It will be seen that the following passage exactl y confir ms the accoun t given by Barruel: As the Lodge of the Amis Réun is colle cted together everything tha t could be found out from all other m asonic systems in the world, so the way was s oon paved there for Illuminism. It was also not long before this lodge toge ther with all those that depended on it was im pregna ted with Illuminism. The form er system of all these was as if wiped out, so that from this time onwards the framework of th e Phila lèthes quite disappe ared and in the place of the form er Cabal istic-magical extravagan ce [ Schwärme rei ] came in the philosophi cal-political. 611 It was ther efore not Martinis m, Cabalis m, or Freemasonr y that in th emselves provided the real revolution ary force. Man y non-illu minized Free masons, as Barrue l himself declares, re mained loyal to the throne and al tar, and as soon a s the monarch y was seen to be in danger the Royalist Brothers of the Contrat Socia l boldl y summoned the lodges to coalesce in defence of King and Constitu tion; even som e of the upper Masons, w ho in the degre e of Knight Kadosch had sworn hatred to the Pope and Bourbon mo narch y, rallied likewise to th e royal cause. \"The French spirit triumphed over the mason ic spiri t in the greater nu mber of the Brothers. O pinions as well as hear ts were still for the King.\" It needed the devastat ing doctrin es of Weishaup t to under mine this spirit and to turn the \"degre es of vengeance\" from vain ceremonial into terribl e fact. If, then, it is said that the Revolu tion was prepared in the lodges of Free masons--and many French Mason s have boasted of the fact- -let it alwa ys be added tha t it was Illumin ized Fr eemason ry that made the Revolu tion, and that the Mason s who acc laim it are illuminized Masons, inheritors of th e sam e tradit ion introdu ced into the lodges of France in 1787 b y the disciples of Weishaupt, \"patriar ch of the Jacobins.\""},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"Many of the Freem asons of France in 1787 were thus not conscious a llies of the Illuminati. According to Cadet de Ga ssicour t, there were in al l the lodges onl y twen ty- seven rea l initiates; th e rest were l argely dupes who knew lit tle or nothing of the source whence the fresh influ ence among the m derived. The a mazing feature of the whole situation is that th e most enthusi astic support ers of the m ovement were m en belonging to the upper classes and even to the royal families of Europe. A conte mporar y relates that no less than thirty princes--reign ing and non-re igning--had taken under their protect ion a confed eration from which they stood to lose everything and had beco me so i mbued by its princ iples th at the y were inac cessible to reason. 612 Intoxica ted by the fla ttery lavished on them by the priests of Illu minism, they adopt ed a rel igion of w hich they understood nothing. Weishaup t, of course, had taken car e that none of these royal dupes should be initiated in to the real aims of the Order, and at first adhered to the original plan of excluding th em altogeth er; but the valu e of the ir co-opera tion soon beca me apparent and by a supreme irony it was with a Grand Duke that he hi mself took refuge. But if the great m ajority of princes and nobles were strick en with bl indness at this crisis, a few far -seeing spirits recogni zed th e danger and warned the world of the i mpending disaste r. In 1787 Cardin al Caprar a, Apostoli c Nuncio at Vienna, addressed a conf identi al memoir to the Pope, in which he point ed out that th e activities carri ed on in Germany by the different sects of Illu minés, of Perfec tibilists, of Free masons, et c., were incr easing. The danger is approa ching, for fro m all these senseless drea ms of Il luminism, of Swedenbor gianis m, or of Free masonr y a frightful reali ty will emerge. Visionar ies have their time; the revolu tion they forebode will have its time also. 613 A more amazing prophec y, however , was the Essai sur la Sec te des Illuminés , by the Marquis de Lu chet, 614 a Libera l noble who pla yed some part in the revolut ionar y movement, yet who neverth eless real ized the dangers of Il luminism. Thus, as earl y as 1789, before the Revolu tion had real ly develop ed, de Luch et uttered these words of warning: Deluded people ... learn th at ther e exists a conspirac y in favour of despotis m against liberty, of incapa city against talen t, of vice against virtue, of ignorance against enlighten ment.... This s ociety aims at governing the world.... Its ob ject is universa l domination. This plan may seem extraordin ary, incredible- -yes, but not chim erical ... no such ca lamity has ever yet afflicted the world. De Luch et then goes on to foret ell precisel y the even ts that were to tak e plac e thre e and four y ears later; he describes the position of a king who has to recogn ize masters above himself and to authoriz e their \"abo minable régime,\" to beco me the plaything of an ambitious and fanati cal horde which has tak en pos session of his will. See him conde mned to serve the passions of all that surround hi m ... to ra ise degraded men to power , to prostitute his judgement by choices tha t dishonour his prudence...."},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"All this was exactl y fulfil led during the re ign of the Girondin m inistr y of 1792. The campaign of destruction carried out in the sum mer of 1793 is thus foretold : We do not m ean to say that th e countr y where the Il luminés reign will cease to exist, but it will fall into such a degre e of hu miliation tha t it will no longer count in poli tics, tha t the popula tion will di minish, tha t the inhabit ants who resist the inclin ation to pass into a foreign land wil l no longer enjoy the happiness of considera tion, nor the char ms of socie ty, nor the gifts of co mmerce. And de Luch et ends with this despairing appeal to the powers of Europe : Masters of the world, cast y our eyes on a desolated multitude, listen to their cries, the ir tears, their hopes. A mother asks y ou to restore her son, a wife her husband, y our cities for the fine ar ts that have fled from them, the countr y for ci tizens, the fie lds for cultivators, relig ion for for ms of wor ship, and Nature for be ings of w hich she is worth y. Five years after these word s were written the countr yside of France was desolat e, art and commerce were destro yed, and wom en following the tu mbril that carried Fouqui er- Tinville to the guillo tine cried out: \"Give m e back my brother , my son, m y husband!\" So was this a mazing prophec y fulfilled. Yet not one word has histor y to sa y on the subject! The warning of de Luch et has fal len on deaf ears a mongst posterity as am ongst the men of his own da y. De Luch et himself recogn izes the obstacle to his obta ining a hearing: there are too many \"passions inter ested in supporting the system of the Il luminés,\" too m any deluded rulers imagining themselves enligh tened ready to precipi tate their people into the abyss, whilst \"the heads of the Order will never relinquish the author ity they have acquired nor the treasure at their dispo sal.\" In vain de Luchet appeals to the Free masons to save the ir Order fro m the invad ing sect. \"Would i t not be possible,\" he asks, \"to direc t the Freemasons th emselves against the Illuminés b y showing the m that whilst the y are working to maintain har mony in socie ty, those others are ever ywher e sowing seeds of discord\" and preparing the ult imate destruc tion of their Order?

What Barrue l saw , de Luche t foresaw with equa l clearness. As to the rôle of Mirabeau at this crisis, we can onl y hazard an explanat ion on the score of his habitual inconsistenc y. At one moment he was seeking int erviews with th e King' s ministers in order to warn the m of the coming dange r, at the next he was ener getically stirring up insurrect ion. It is th erefore not i mpossible that he m ay have encourag ed de Luch et's exposure of the conspiracy, although m eanwhile he hi mself had ent ered into the scheme of destruct ion. Indeed, according to a pa mphlet published in 1791 enti tled Mystèr es de la Conspiration , 615 the whole plan of revolution was found am ongst his papers. The editor of this brochure explains tha t the docum ent here m ade publi c, cal led Croquis ou P rojet de Ré volution de Monsieur de Mirabeau , was seiz ed at the house of Mada me Lejai, the wife of Mirabe au's publisher , on October 6, 1789. Beginning with a diatribe against the French m onarchy, the docu ment goes on to sa y that \"in order to triumph over this h ydra-headed monster th ese are m y ideas\": We must over throw all order , suppres s all laws, annul all power, and leav e the people in anarchy. The laws we estab lish will not perhaps be in force a t once, but at an y rate, having given back the power to the peopl e, the y will resist for the sake of th eir liberty which they will believ e they are preserving. We must caress their vanit y, flatter the ir hopes, pro mise them happiness after our w ork has been in operat ion; we must elude their caprices and their s ystems at will, for the peopl e as legisl ators are very dangerous, the y only establish l aws which coincid e with the ir passions, their want of knowledge would besides onl y give bir th to abuses. But as the people are a lever which legisla tors can move at their wil l, we mus t necessarily use the m as a support, and render hatefu l to them everything we wish to destro y and so w illusions in the ir path ; we mus t also buy all th e mercenar y pens w hich propagate our me thods and which will instruct the people concerning the ir ene mies who m we at tack. The cler gy, being th e most powerful through publi c opinion, can onl y be destro yed by ridiculing relig ion, render ing its m inisters odious, and only representing them as hypocritical monsters, for Maho met in order to estab lish his rel igion first defamed the pagan ism which th e Arabs, the Sarm athes, and the Scythians profes sed. Libels must at every moment show fresh traces of hatr ed against the clergy. To exaggera te the ir rich es, to m ake the sins of an ind ividua l appear to be co mmon to all, to attr ibute to the m all vices; calumny, murder , irreligion, sacri lege, all is perm itted in times of revolution. We must degrad e the noblesse and attr ibute it to an odious origin, establish a germ of equality which can never exist but which will flatter the people ; [we mus t] immolate the most obstinate, burn and destro y their propert y in order to intimidate the rest, so that if we canno t entir ely destroy this prejudice we can weaken i t and the people will aveng e their vani ty and the ir jealous y by all the excesses w hich will bring the m to subm ission. After describing how the soldiers are to be seduced fro m their alleg iance, and the magistrates represented to the people as despots, \"since the peopl e, bruta l and ignoran t, only see the evi l and never the good of things,\" the writer expla ins the y must be given only limited power in the m unicipalities."},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Let us beware above all of giving the m too much force ; their despotis m is too dangerous, we m ust flatter the people b y gratuitous ju stice, prom ise the m a grea t diminution in tax es and a mo re equa l division, more extension in fortunes, and less hu miliation. These phant asies [ vertiges ] will fana ticise the people, who will flatten out all resistance. What matter the vic tims and their num bers? spolia tions, destruct ions, burnings, and al l the necessary effects of a revo lution? nothing must be sacred and we can sa y with Machi avelli: \"What m atter the m eans as long as one arriv es at th e end? \" Were al l these the ide as of Mirabeau, or were the y, like th e other docum ent of the Illuminati found am ongst his papers, the program me of a conspira cy? I inc line to the latter theor y. The plan of ca mpaign was, at any rate, the one followed out b y the conspira tors, as Cham fort, the friend and confidan t of Mirabeau, admitted in his conversa tion with Marmon tel: The nation is a great herd that only thinks of bro wsing, and with good sheepdogs the shepherds can lead i t as the y please.... Mone y and the hope of plunder are a ll-powerful with the peopl e.... Mirabeau cheerful ly asserts that with 100 louis one can m ake quit e a good riot. 616 Another conte mporar y thus describes the methods of the lead ers: Mirabe au, in the exuberanc e of an or gy, cried one day: \"That canail le well deserves to have us for l egislators!\" These profes sions of fa ith, as we see, are not at all democratic; the sect uses the populace as revolution fodder [ chair à révolut ion ], as pri me material for brigand age, aft er which i t seizes the gold and abandons generat ions to tortur e. It is veritably the code of hell. 617 It is this \"code of he ll\" set forth in the \"Pro jet de Révolut ion\" tha t we shall find repeat ed in succeeding docum ents throughou t the last hundred years--in the correspondence of the \"Alta Vendita,\" in the Dialogues aux Enfers entr e Machiav el et Montesquieu by Maurice Joly, in the Revolu tionar y Catech ism of Bakunin, in the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, and in the writ ings of the Russian Bolsheviks to-da y. Whatever doubts ma y be cast on the au thenti city of an y of these docum ents, th e indisput able fact thus rem ains th at as ear ly as 1789 this Machi avellian plan of engin eering revolution and using the people as a lever for raising a t yrannica l minority to power , had been for mulated; further , that the m ethods described in this ear liest \"Protoco l\" have been carr ied out according to plan from that day to this. And in ever y outbreak of the social revolution the authors of the m ovement have been known to be connec ted with secre t societ ies. It was Adrien Duport, author of th e \"Great Fear\" that spread over France on July 22, 1789, Duport, the inner in itiate of the secret societ ies, \"holding in his hands all the threads of the m asoni c conspirac y,\" who on Ma y 21, 1790, set forth before the Committee of Propaganda the vast schem e of de struction."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"M. de Mirabeau has well estab lished the fact that the fortun ate revolution which has taken plac e in France must and will be for all th e peoples of Europe the awakening of liberty and for King s the sleep of death. But Duport goes on to expla in that whilst Mirabe au thinks i t advisabl e at present not to concern the mselves with an ything outside France, he himself believ es that the triu mph of the French Revolu tion m ust lead inevit ably to \"the ruin of all thrones ... Therefore we must hasten a mong our neighbours the same revolut ion tha t is going on in France.\" 618 The plan of i lluminized Freem asonr y was thus nothing less than world-revolu tion. It is necessar y here to reply to a crit ic who suggested tha t in emphasizing the rôle of the secre t societ ies in World Revolution I had abandoned m y form er thesis of th e Orléanist e conspira cy. I wish therefore to stat e that I do not retr act one word I w rote in The Fr ench Revolution on the Orléaniste conspirac y, I me rely suppl y a further explana tion of its efficiency by enlar ging on the aid it received from the party I referr ed to as the Subversives--outco me of the masonic lodges. It was because the Orléan istes held the whole mason ic organization at their disposal that they were abl e to carry out the ir plans with such extraordinar y skill and thoroughness, and because they had at the ir back men bent solel y on destruc tion that they could enlist a following which would not have rallied to a me re schem e of usurpat ion. Even Montjoie, who saw in the Revolut ion princip ally the work of the Duc d' Orléans, indic ates in a ver y curious passage of a later work the existence of the stil l darker intrigue behind the conspirac y he had spent his ener gies in unvei ling: I will not exa mine whether this wicked prince, thinking he was acting in his personal interests, was not m oved by that invisible hand which see ms to have cre ated all the events of our revolu tion in order to l ead us towards a goal that we do not see at present, but which I think we shall see before long. 619 Unfortunat ely, after th is mysterious ut teranc e Mont joie never again returns to the subject. At the beginning of the Revolu tion, Orléanism and Freemasonr y thus for med a united body. According to Lom bard de Langres: France in 1789 counted more than 2,000 lodges af filiated to the Grand Orient ; the numb er of adep ts wa s more than 100,000. The first even ts of 1789 were onl y Masonr y in act ion. All the revolu tionar ies of the Constituent Assembly were ini tiated in to the third degre e. We plac e in this class the Duc d'Orléans, Valence, Syllery, Laclos, Sièyes, Pétion, Menou, Biron, Montesqui eu, Fauchet, Condorcet, Lafa yette, Mirabeau, Garat, Rabaud, Dubois- Cranc é, Thiébaud, Laroch efoucauld, and others. 620 Amongst these others were not only the Brissotins, who for med the nucl eus of the Girondin party, but the m en of the Terror--Marat, Robespierr e, Danton, and Desmoul ins."},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"It was these fiercer elements, true disciples of the Illu minati, who were to sweep awa y the visionar y Masons drea ming of equa lity and brotherhood. Following the precedent set b y Weishaupt, classica l pseudon yms were adopted by these l eaders of the Jacobins, thus Chau mette was kno wn as Anaxagor as, Clootz as Anacharsis, Danton as Horace, Lacroix as Publico la, and Ronsin as Scaevola 621 ; again, af ter the manner of the Illu minati, the names of town s were changed and a revolut ionar y calendar was adopt ed. The red cap and loose hair af fected by the Jacobins appear also to have been foreshadowed in the lodges of the Illuminati. 622 Yet faithful ly as the Terrorists carried out the plan of the Illuminati, it would seem that they themselves were not in itiated into the inner most secrets of the conspirac y. Behind the Convention, behind the clubs, behind the Revolu tionar y Tribunal, there ex isted, sa ys Lombard de L angres, that \"most secret convent ion [ convention sécrétissime ] which directed everything after May 31, an occul t and terr ible power of w hich the other Convent ion beca me the slave and which was com posed of the prim e initiates of Illuminism. This power was above Robespierre and the committees of the govern ment, ... it was this occul t power which appropri ated to itself the tr easures of the na tion and distribu ted them to the brothers and friends who had helped on the grea t work.\" 623 What was the ai m of this occu lt power? Was it merely the pl an of destruct ion tha t had origin ated in the brain of a Bavarian profes sor twent y years earl ier, or w as it something far older , a live and terribl e force that had lain dorm ant through the centuri es, that Weishaupt and his all ies had not creat ed but onl y loosed upon the world? The Reign of Terror, like th e outbreak of Satanis m in the Middle Ages, can be expla ined b y no m aterial causes--the orgy of hatred, lust, and crue lty directed not onl y against the rich but still more against the poor and defencel ess, the destruct ion of scienc e, art, and beaut y, the desecra tion of the churches, the or ganiz ed ca mpaign against al l that was noble, al l that was sacred, al l that humanity holds dea r, what was this but Satanism? In desecra ting the churches and stam ping on the cruc ifixes th e Jacobins had in fact followed the prec ise for mula of black magic: \"For the purpo se of infernal evocat ion ... it is requisi te ... to profane the ceremonies of the relig ion to which one belongs and to trample its holi est symbols under foot.\" 624 It was this that for med the prelude to the \"Great Terror,\" when, to those who lived through it, it seem ed tha t France lay under the sway of the powers of darkness. So in the \"great shipwreck of civi lization,\" as a conte mporar y has described it, the projects of the Cabalists, the Gnostics, and the secret societies which for nearl y eight een centuries had sapped the foundat ions of Christian ity found their fulf ilment. Do we not detect an echo of th e Toledot Yeshu in the blasphe mies of the Marquis de Sade concerning \"the Jewish slave\" and \"the adult erous w oman, the courtesan of Gali lee?\" And in the imprecations of Marat's w orshippers, \"Christ was a false prophet!\" a repet ition of the secret doctrine attributed to the Templars: \"Jesus is not the true God; He is a false prophet ; He was not crucif ied for th e salvat ion of hu manity, but for His o wn m isdeeds\"? Are these resem blances acc identa l, or are they the outco me of a cont inuous plot against the Christian faith?"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"What, then, was the rôle of Jews in the Revolution? In this connex ion it is necessar y to understand the situa tion of the Jew s in France at this period. After the decre e of banish ment issued b y Charl es VI in 1394, J ewry, as a bod y, had ceased to exist ; but toward s the end of the fifteenth cen tury a cer tain num ber of Jews, driven out of Spain and Portugal, were allowed to settle in Bordeaux. These Spanish and Portuguese Jews, kno wn as Sephar dim , appeared to acqui esce in the Christi an rel igion and were not of ficially regarded as Jews, but enjo yed considerabl e privi leges conferr ed on the m by Henri II. It was not until the beginn ing of the eighte enth centur y, during the Regen cy, that Jew s began to reappe ar in Paris. M eanwhi le, the annexat ion of Alsace at the end of the previous centur y had added to the popul ation of France the Germ an Jews of tha t provinc e known as the Ashkenazim . It is im portan t to distinguish between these two rac es of Je ws in discussing the question of Jewish em ancipation at the time of the Revolu tion. For whilst the Sephardi m had shown the mselv es good citi zens and were therefore subject to no persecutions, the Ashkenazi m by their extort ionate usur y and oppressions had ma de themselv es detested by the people, so that rigorous laws were enforc ed to restra in the ir rapac ity. The discussions that raged in the Nation al Assembly on the sub ject of the Jewish question related therefore mainly to the Jews of Alsace. Alread y, in 1784, th e Jew s of Bordeaux had been accord ed further concessions b y Louis XV I; in 1776 all Portuguese Jew s had been given rel igious lib erty and the per mission to inhab it all par ts of the kingdo m. The decree of Januar y 28, 1790, conferr ing on the Jews of Bordeaux the rights of French citizens, put the finishing touch to this scheme of lib eration. But th e proposal to extend this privileg e to th e Jew s of Alsace evoked a storm of controv ersy in the Assembly and also violent insurrections amongst the Alsati an peasants. It was thus on beha lf of the peopl e that several deputies protested aga inst the decree. \"The Jews,\" said the Abbé Maur y, \"have traversed seventeen centuri es without m ingling with other nations.

Thirty years earlier the m erchants of Paris, in a peti tion against the admission of the Jew s to their corpora tions, indi cated by an ad mirable simile the danger this solidarity offered to free commerce. The French m erchant carr ies on his co mmerce alone ; each commercial house is in a way isolated, whilst the Jews are part icles of quicksilver , which at the le ast slant run together into a block. 627 But in spite of all prot ests, the decr ee emancipa ting the Jew s of Alsace was pas sed in Septe mber 1791, and hymns of praise were sung in the synagogu es.

But illuminating as these inciden ts ma y be, it is y et open to quest ion whether they prove any concerted attempt on the part of the Jews to bring about the overthrow of the French monarchy and the Cathol ic religion. It is true, neverthe less, that they themselves boasted of the ir revolu tionar y ardour . In an addres s present ing the ir claims before the Nat ional Assembly in 1789, the y declare: Regen erators of the French E mpire, y ou would not wish tha t we should cease to be citizens, since for alr eady six m onths we have assiduousl y perfor med all duties as such, and the reco mpense for the zeal we have shown in acce lerating the revolut ion will not be to condem n us to par ticipate in none of i ts advantag es no w tha t it has been consu mmated.... Nosseigneurs, we are all very good cit izens, and in this m emorable revolu tion we dare to sa y that there is not one of us who has not proved hi mself. 633 In all these activ ities, ho weve r, religious feel ing appears to have pl ayed an entire ly subordinat e part ; the Jews, as has been said, were free before the Revolu tion to carry on the rites of th eir fai th. And when the great anti- religious campaign began, m any of the m entered whole- hearted ly into the at tack on all religious faiths, the ir own included. Thus on the 21st Brum aire, whilst the Feasts of Reason were tak ing plac e in the churches of Paris, we find \"a deputat ion of Israel ites\" present ing the mselves at the Nat ional Assembly and \"depo siting on th e bosom of the Mounta in the ornam ents of w hich they had stripped a little temple they had in the Faubour g Saint-Ger main.\" At th e sam e moment-- A revolu tionar y committee of the Réunion brings to the gener al counc il crosses, sun s, chalices, copes, and quanti ties of other orna ments of wor ship, and a m ember of this committee observes that severa l of these effects belong to indiv iduals of th e Jewish race.

What an abom ination! What a horror! And where does tha t all come from but from the Rabbis ? Who have excited proscript ions against us? Our priests! Ah, citi zens, m ore than an ything in the world we m ust abjure a religion which, ... b y subjecting us to irkso me and servil e practices, makes it impossible for u s to be good cit izens. 635 The encourage ment accorded by the Jews to the French Revolution appears thus to have been prom pted not b y relig ious fanat icism but b y a desire for nationa l advan tage. That they gained immensely by the overthrow of the Old O rder is undeniable, for apart from the legisl ation passed on their beha lf in the Nation al Assembly, the disorder of the finan ces in 1796 was such that, as M . Leon Kahn tel ls us, a conte mpor ary journal enquir ed: \"Has the Revolution then been only a financia l sche me? a specul ation of bankers?\" 636 We know from Prudhom me to what race the financiers who princ ipally profit ed by this disorder belonged. 637 But if the rôle of the Jews in the Revolut ion re mains obscure there can be no doubt of the part played by the secre t societ ies in th e revolt against all religion, all moral laws, and socia l order , which had been reduced to a system in th e counci ls of the Il luminati. It was this conspiracy that reasserted itself in the Babouviste rising of 1796 which was directly inspired b y the secret societies. After th e death of Babeuf, his friend and inspirer Buonarot ti with the a id of Marat's brother founded a masonic lodge, the Amis Sincèr es , which was affiliated to the Philad elphes , at Geneva, and as \"Diacr e Mobile\" of the \"Order of Subli me and Perfec t Masons\" created three new secret degre es, in which the device of the Rose-Croix I.N.R.I. wa s interpret ed as signif ying \"Justu m necare reges injustos.\" 638 The part to be assigned to ea ch intr igue in preparing the world-m ovement of w hich the French Revolution was the first expression is a question on which no one can speak with certainty. But, as at the present m oment, the composit e nature of this m ovement must"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"never be lost to sight. Lar gely perhaps the work of Freder ick the Great, i t is probable that but for the Orléan istes the plot aga inst the French monarch y might have co me to nought ; whilst again, but for his po sition a t the head of il luminized Freemasonr y it is doubtful whether the Duc d'Orléans could have co mmanded the forces of revolu tion. Furthe r, how far the m ovement, which, like the m odern Bolshevist conspiracy, appe ars to have had unlimited funds at i ts dispo sal, was financed by the Jews y et remains to be discovered. Hither to onl y the first steps have been tak en towards eluc idating the truth abou t the French Revolution. In the opinion of an earl y ninete enth-cen tury writer the sect which engine ered th e French Revolu tion was absolute ly international: The authors of the Revolution are not more French than Ger man, Italian, Engl ish, etc. They form a part icular nat ion which took birth and has grown in th e darkness, in the midst of all civilized nations, with the object of subjecting them to its dom ination. 639 It is curious to find almost prec isely the sa me idea expressed by the Duke of Bruns wick, formerly the \"Eques a Victori a\" of the Stricte Observan ce, \"Aaron\" of the Illuminati, and Grand Master of Ger man Freem asonr y, who, whether because the Revolut ion had done its work in destro ying the French m onarch y and now threat ened th e securit y of Germ any, or whether because he was genuin ely disillusioned in the Orders to which he had belong ed, issued a Manifesto to all the lodges in 1794, dec laring that in view of the way in which Masonry had been pene trated by this grea t sect the whole Order m ust be temporari ly suppres sed. It is essentia l to quote a part of this i mpor tant docum ent verba tim: Amidst the universa l stor m produced by the present revolut ions in the polit ical and m oral world, at this period of supreme illumination and of profound blindn ess, it would be a crime aga inst truth and hu manity to leave any longer shrouded in a vei l things th at can provide the onl y key to past and future even ts, things tha t should show to thousands of men whether the path they have been m ade to follow is the path of foll y or of wisdo m. It has to do with y ou, VV. FF. of a ll degre es and of all secret systems. The curta in must at last be drawn aside, so that your blind ed eyes may see that light you have ever sought in vain, but of which y ou have only caugh t a few dec eptive rays....

With a last blow of the hammer we overthrow the columns of salar ies. We leave the temple deserted, and we bequeath it as a great work to poster ity which shall raise it aga in on its ruins and bring it to co mpletion. Brunswick then goes on to expla in what has brought about the ruin of the Order, namely, the infiltration of Free masonr y by secret conspira tors:"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"A great sect arose which, tak ing for its m otto the good and the happiness of m an, worked in the darkness of the conspirac y to make the happiness of hu manity a pre y for itself.

It is the y who have underm ined the foundations of the Order to the point of co mplete overthrow; it is b y them that all humanity has been poisoned and led astra y for severa l genera tions. The ferment that reigns amongst the peoples is the ir work. They founded th e plans of the ir insatiable ambition on the poli tical pride of nations. Their founders arranged to introdu ce this pride into the heads of the peopl es. They began by casting odiu m on relig ion.... They inven ted th e rights of m an which it is impossible to discover even in th e book of Nature, and they urged the people to wrest from their princes the recogn ition of these supposed rights. The plan they had for med for breaking all social ties and of destro ying all order was reveal ed in all th eir speech es and acts. They deluged the world with a mu ltitude of publi cations; the y recruit ed apprent ices of ever y rank and in every position ; they deluded the most perspica cious m en by falsel y alleg ing dif feren t intentions. They sowed in the hearts of y outh the seed of covetousness, and the y excit ed it with the bait of the m ost insatiable passions. Indom itable prid e, thirst of po wer, such were the onl y motives of this sect: their masters had nothing l ess in view than the thrones of the earth, and the govern ment of th e nations was to be direct ed by their nocturna l clubs. This is what has been done and is still being done. But we notice that princes and people are unaware how and b y what m eans this is being acco mplished. That is wh y we sa y to them in all frankness: The misuse of our Order , the misunderstand ing of our secret, has produced all the poli tical and moral troubles with which the world is fi lled to-da y. You who have been initiated, you must join y ourselves with us in raising y our voic es, so as to teach peopl es and princes that the sectar ians, the apostates of our Order , have alone been and will be th e authors of present and future revolutions. We must assure princ es and peopl es, on our honour and our dut y, that our associa tion is in no wa y guilt y of these evils. But in order that our attest ations should have force and merit belief, we m ust m ake for princ es and people a complete sacrific e; so as to cu t out to the roots the abuse and error, we must from this moment dissolve the whole Order . This is wh y we destro y and annih ilate it completely for the time; we will preserve the foundations for poster ity, which will clear the m when hum anity, in better times, can deriv e som e benef it from our hol y alliance. 640 Thus, in the opinion of the Grand Master of Ger man Free masonr y, a secret sect working within Free masonr y had brought about the French Revo lution and would be the cause of all future revolut ions. We shall now pur sue the course of this sect after the first upheaval had ended. Three years aft er the Duke of Brun swick issued his Manifesto to the lodges, the book s of Barrue l, Robison, and others appeared, laying bare the whole conspirac y. It has been said that all these book s \"fel l flat.\" 641 This is direc tly contr ary to the truth. Barruel's book went into no less than e ight edi tions, and I have described elsewhere th e alar m that his work and Robison 's exci ted in Americ a.

This fac t should be borne in mind when we are assured th at Barrue l and Robison had conjured up a boge y which met with no serious a ttention fro m respon sible men. For the main purpose of Barruel's book is to show that not onl y had Illu minism and Grand Orient Masonr y contribu ted largely to the French Revo lution, but that three years after that first explosion they were still as ac tive as ever . This is the great point which the cha mpions of the \"boge y\" theor y are most anxious to refute. \"The Bavari an Order of the Illuminati,\" wrote Mr . Waite, \"was founded by Adam Weishaupt in 1776, and it was suppressed b y the E lector of Bavaria in 1789.... Those who sa y that 'it was continued in m ore secret forms' have never produced one item of real evidence.\" 642 Now , as we have seen, the Illuminati were not suppressed by the Elector of Bavar ia in 1789, but in 1786--first error of Mr . Waite. But m ore extraordinar y confusion of m ind is displa yed in his Encyc lopædia of Freemasonry , where, in a Masonic Chronolog y, he gives, this time under the date of 1784, \"Suppression of the Illuminati,\" but under 1793: \"J. J.C. Bode joined the Illu minati under Weishaupt.\" At a matter of fact, this was the y ear Bode died. These exa mples will serve to show the reliance that can be placed on Mr . Waite's state ment conc erning the Illu minati. We shall now see that not only the Illuminati but Weishaupt hims elf sti ll con tinued to intrigue long after the French Revolution had ended. Direc tly the Reign of Terror was over , the m asonic lodges, which during the Revolu tion had been repla ced b y the clubs, began to reopen, and b y the beginn ing of the ninet eenth century were in a mo re flour ishing condi tion than ever before. \"It was the m ost brilliant epoch of Ma sonry,\" wrote the Free mason Bazot in his Histor y of Free masonr y. Nearl y 1,200 lodges existed in France under th e Empire; generals, m agistrates, artists, savants, and notabil ities in ever y line were initiated into th e Order . 643 The m ost eminent of these was Prince Ca mbacér ès, pro G rand Master of the Grand Orient. It is in the midst of this period tha t we find Weishaupt once m ore at work behind th e scenes of Free masonr y. Thus in the remarkab le masoni c correspondenc e published by M. Benja min Fabre in his Eques a Capite Galea to --of which, as has alr eady been pointed out, the auth enticity is adm itted by eminent British Freemasons--a let ter is reproduced from Pyron, represen tative in Paris of the Grand Orient of Ital y, to the Marquis de Chefdeb ien, dat ed Septe mber 9, 1808, in which it is stated th at \"a member of the sect of Bav.\" has asked for inform ation on a certa in point of ritual. On Dece mber 29, 1808, P yron writes again : \"By the words 'sect of B....' I me ant W....\"; and on D ecember 3, 1809, puts the m atter quite plainl y: \"The other word rem aining at the end of m y pen refers enig matically to Weis=pt.\" So, as M. Fabre points out: There is no longer any doubt tha t it is a question here of Weishaupt, and yet one observes that his na me is not y et written in all its letters.

And is it not in the lodges bound tog ether, co-and sub- ordina ted, th at the monster Weishaupt established his tests and had his horrible principl es prepar ed? 645 If, then, as M . Gustave Bord as serts, th e Marquis de Chefdeb ien had hims elf be longed to the Illuminati before the Revolu tion, here is indeed Illuminist ev idence in support of Barrue l! Yet disillusion ed as the \"Eques a Capi te Gale ato\" appe ars to have been with regard to Illu minism, he stil l reta ined his a llegiance to Free masonr y. This w ould tend to prove that, however subversive the doctr ines of the Grand Orient may have been- -and indeed undoubted ly were--it was not Freem asonr y itself but Illuminism which or ganized the movement of which the French Revo lution was the first m anifestat ion. As Mon signor Dillon has expressed it: Had Weishaupt not lived, Masonry might have ceased to be a power aft er the react ion consequen t on the French Revolut ion. He gave it a for m and chara cter which caused it to outlive that rea ction, to ener gize to the present day, and which will cause it to advance until its final conflic t with Christ ianity must determine whether Christ or Satan shal l reign on this ear th to the end. 646 If to the word Ma sonry we add Grand Orient--tha t is to sa y, the Masonr y not of Great Britain, but of the Cont inent- -we s hall be sti ll near er to the truth. In the early part of the ninet eenth centur y Illuminism was thus as mu ch alive as eve r. Joseph de Maistre, writing at this period, constantl y refers to th e danger it presents to Europe. Is it not also to Illu minism that a mysterious passage in a recen t work of M. Lenô tre refers? In the course of conversation with the friends of the false Dauphin Hervagau lt. Monsignor de Savine is said to have \"made allusions in prudent and almost terrified terms to some intern ational sect ... a power superior to all others ... w hich has arms and e yes everywhere and which governs Europe to-da y.\" 647 When in World Revolution I asserted that during the period tha t Napoleon held the reins of power the devastat ing fire of Illu minism was te mpor arily extingu ished, I wrote without knowledge of some impor tant docum ents which prove that Illuminism continued without break from the date of its foundation all through the period of the Empire.

The docu ments in which th is evidence is to be found are referred to by Lom bard de Langres, who, writing in 1820, observes tha t the Jacobins were invisibl e from the 18th Bru maire until 1813, and goes on to say: Here th e sect disappears; we find to guide us during th is period onl y uncerta in notions, scattered fragm ents; the plo ts of Illu minism lie buried in the boxes of the I mper ial police. But the cont ents of these boxe s no long er lie buried; transported to the Archives Nation ales, the docu ments in which the intrigu es of Illu minism are laid bare have at last been given to the publi c.

The author of the most detailed report 648 is one Franço is Charles de Berckhei m, specia l commissioner of pol ice at Ma yence towards the end of the E mpire, who as a Free mason is natur ally not disposed to prejudice against secret socie ties. In O ctober 1810 he writes, however , that his atten tion has been drawn to the Illuminati by a pamphlet which has j ust fallen in to his hands, na mely the Essai sur la Sec te des Illuminés , which, like m any contemporar ies, he at tribut es original ly to Mirabeau. He then goes on to ask whether the sect still exists, and if so whether it is ind eed \"an associa tion of frightful scoundrels w ho aim, as Mirabeau assures us, at the overthrow of a ll law and all morality, at repla cing virtue by crime in every act of hu man life.\" Furthe r, he asks whether both sects of Illumin és have now co mbin ed in one and what are their present projects. Conversations with other Free masons further incre ase Berckhe im's anxiet y on the subject; one of the best inform ed observes to him: \"I kno w a great dea l, enough a t any rate to be convinced that the Illuminés have vowed the overthrow of mon archic govern ments and of all author ity on the sa me basis.\" Berckh eim thereupon sets out to m ake enquiri es, with the result tha t he is ab le to state that the Illuminés have initiates all over Europe, tha t they have spared no ef forts to introdu ce their princ iples into the lodges, and \"to spread a doctrin e subversive of al l settled govern ment ... under the pre text of the regener ation of social morality and the amelioration of the lot and condi tion of m en by means of law s founded on principl es and sentiments unknown hith erto and contain ed onl y in the heads of th e lead ers.\" \"Illuminism,\" he dec lares, \"is beco ming a great and form idable power , and I fear , in my consci ence, that kings and peoples will have m uch to suf fer fro m it unless foresight and prudenc e break its frightful mechanism [ ses affr eux restorts ].\" Two years later, on Januar y 16, 1813, Berckh eim writes again to the Minister of Poli ce: Monseigneur , they write to m e from Heidelb erg ... that a great num ber of initi ates in to the mysteries of Illu minism are to be found there."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"These gentle men wear as a sign of recognit ion a gold ring on the third fing er of the left hand; on the back of this ring there is a little rose, in the m iddle of this rose is an al most impercep tible dint; by pressing this with the point of a pin one touches a spring, b y this means the two gold circl es are det ached.

We shall find this appar ent paradox running al l through th e Illu minist movement to the present da y. In 1814 Berckh eim drew up his great repor t on the secret socie ties of Ger many, which is of so mu ch importan ce in throwing a ligh t on the workings of th e modern revolution ary movement, that extrac ts mus t be given here a t length. 649 His testi mony gains grea ter weight from the vagueness he displa ys on the origins of Illu minism and the role i t had played before the French Revo lution ; it is evident, therefore, that he had not taken his ideas from Robison or Barruel- -to whom he never once refers--but fro m infor mation gleaned on the spot in Ger many. The opening paragraphs fina lly refute the fallacy concerning the extin ction of the sect in 1786. The oldest and most dangerous associat ion is tha t which is gener ally known under the denomination of the Illuminés and of w hich the foundat ion goes back towards the m iddle of the last cen tury. Bavar ia was its crad le; it is said that it had for founders severa l chiefs of the Order of the Jesuits; but this opinion, advanced perhaps at random , is founded onl y on uncerta in premises; in an y case, in a short time it made rap id progress, and the Bavar ian Govern ment recogni zed th e necessit y of em ploying methods of repres sion against it and even of driving awa y several of the princip al sect aries.

The reveries of the Piet ists have long been confounded with those of the Illuminés. This error may arise from the denom ination of the sect, which at first suggests the idea of a purel y relig ious fanati cism and of m ystic forms which it was oblig ed to t ake at its birth in order to concea l its principl es and pro jects; but the Associat ion alwa ys had a polit ical tendency.

Amongst secret associa tions rec ently existing in Germany, the witness as serted, were the \"Independents\" and the \"Absolutes\"; the latter \"adored in Robespierre their most perfec t ideal, so tha t the crimes co mmitted during the French Revo lution by this m onster and the Montagnards of the Convent ion were in their eyes, in accord ance with their moral system, heroic actions ennobled and sanct ified by their aim.\" The same docu ment goes on to explain why so many combust ible elements had fa iled to produce an explosion in Germ any: The thing th at see med the great obstacle to the plans of the Independ ents... was w hat they called the servil e chara cter and the dog-like fid elity [ Hundestr eue ] of the Germ an peopl e, that is to say, that attach ment--innat e and fir mly impressed on their minds without even the aid of reason- -which that excel lent people everywhere bears towards i ts princes.

But great care was taken not to let them know more than the inter ests of the sect demanded. 651 It was thus tha t Illuminism, unable to provoke a bl aze in the ho me of its bir th, spread, as before the French Revolution, to a m ore infla mmable Latin race--th is time the Italians. Six y ears after his in terrogator y at Be yreuth, Witt Doehring published his book on the secre t societ ies of France and Ital y, in which he no w rea lized he had played the part of dupe, and inciden tally confir ms the stat ement I have previousl y quoted, that the Alta Vendita was a further deve lopm ent of the Illuminati. This infam ous associat ion, with which I have dea lt at length elsewhere, 652 consti tuted the Supre me Director y of the Carbonar i and was led by a group of Ital ian noble men, amongst whom a prince, \"the profoundest of ini tiates, was char ged as Inspector -General of the Order\" to propagate its princip les throughout the North of Europe. \"He had rece ived fro m the hands of Kingge [i.e. Knigge, the al ly of Weishaupt?] the cah iers of the last three degre es.\" But these were of course unknown to the grea t majorit y of Carbonari, who entered the associat ion in al l good fai th. Witt Doehring then show s how faithfu lly the system of Weishaupt was carr ied out by the Alta Vendita. In the thre e first degre es, he explains-- It is still a question of th e morality of Christiani ty and even of the Church, for w hich those who wish to be rec eived must promise to sacrifi ce the mselves. The initiates imagine, according to this formu la, that the object of the association is som ething high and noble, tha t it is the Order of those who desire a purer m orality and a stronger pi ety, the independen ce and the unit y of their countr y. One cannot ther efore judge the Carbonari en masse ; there are exc ellent m en amongst them.... But ever ything changes af ter one has taken the three degrees. Alread y in the fourth, in th at of the Apostoli , one pro mises to overthrow all m onarchies, and especia lly the kings of the race of the Bourbons. But it is only in the seventh and last degree, reached by few, that revela tions go furthe r. At last the veil is torn completely for the Princip i Sum mo Patriarcho. Then one le arns that the ai m of the Carbonari is just the same as tha t of the Illuminés . This degre e, in which a man is at the same time prince and bishop, coincid es with the Homo Rex of the latter. The initiate vows the ruin of all re ligion and of all positive governm ent, whether despot ic or democratic; murd er, poison, perjur y, are all at the ir disposal. Who does not remember that on the suppre ssion of th e Illumin és was found, a mongst other poison s, a tinctura ad abortum faci endum .

According to the plan la id down b y Weishaup t, Free masonr y was habi tually adopted as a cover. Thus Louis Amis de la Vérit é , number ing Bazard and Buchez amongst Blanc, himself a Free mason, speaks of a lodge named the its founders, \"in which the sole mn pueri lities of the Grand Orient only served to m ask poli tical action.\" 655 Bakunin, companion of th e Free mason Proudhon, 656 \"the fath er of Anarch y,\" makes use of precisely the same expression. Freemasonr y, he explains, is not to be tak en seriousl y, but \"may serve as a m ask\" and \"as a me ans of prepar ing som ething quit e differen t.\" 657 I have quoted elsewher e the state ment of the Social ist Malon th at \"Bakunin was a discip le of Weishaupt,\" and that of the Anarchist Kropotkine that between Bakunin's secre t societ y--the Alliance Socia le Démocratique --and the secret socie ties of 1795 th ere was a direc t affiliation; I have quoted the assertion of Malon that \"Com munism was handed down in the dark through the secret socie ties\" of the ninet eenth centur y; I have quoted also the congratul ations addressed by Lam artine and the Free mason Cré mieux to the Freem asons of France in 1848 on their share in this revolution as in tha t of 1789; I have shown tha t the organization of this later outbreak by the secret societ ies is not a matter of surmise, but a fact ad mitted by all well- inform ed historians and by the m embers of the secret societies the mselv es. So, too, in the even ts of the Co mmune, and in the founding of the First Int ernation ale, the role of Freem asonr y and the secret societ ies is no less apparen t. The Free masons of France have inde ed alwa ys boasted of their share in poli tical and social upheav als. Thus in 1874, Malapert, orator of the Suprem e Counc il of the Ancien t and Accepted Scottish Rite, went so far as to say: \"In the e ighteen th cen tury Free masonr y was so widespread throughout the world that one can sa y that since that epoch nothing has been done without its consent.\" The secret histor y of Europe during the last two hundred y ears yet remains to be writ ten.

M ODER N F REEMA SON RY In the foregoing port ion of this book we have followed th e histor y of Free masonr y in the past and the various interpre tations that have been placed on its rites and cere monies. The question now arises: what is the role of Free masonr y to-da y? The fundam ental error of mos t writers on th is question, whether Masonic or anti- Masonic, is to represent all Free masons as holding a co mmon bel ief and ani mated by a common purpose. Thus on one hand the paneg yrics by Freemasons on their Order as a whole, and on the other hand the sweeping conde mnations of the Order b y the Ca tholic Church, are equal ly at fault. The truth is th at Free masonr y in a gener ic sense is si mply a system of binding m en together for an y given purpose, since it is obvious tha t allegori es and s ymbols, like the x and y of alg ebra, can be int erpreted in a hundred different manners. Two pillars m ay be said to represent strength and stab ility, or m an and wom an, or ligh t and darknes s, or an y other two things we please. A triangle may signif y the Trinity, or Liberty, Equal ity, and Fratern ity, or an y other triad. To say that any of these symbols have an absolu te meaning is absurd. The allegor ies of Free masonr y are equa lly capable of various interpr etations. The build ing of the Temple of Solomon m ay signif y the progres s of an y under taking and Hiram the vi ctim of its opponents. So also with regard to the \"secre t trad ition\" of Freemasonr y concerning \"a loss w hich has befal len hu manity\" 658 and its ulti mate recov ery. Any body of peopl e working for an object may be said to have experienc ed a loss and to aim at its recov ery. In the same way the whole or ganiz ation of Freemasonr y, the plan of adm itting cand idates to successive degrees of in itiation, of binding the m to secrecy by fearfu l oaths, is one that can be emplo yed for an y purpose, socia l, poli tical, phi lanthropi c, or rel igious, for promoting tha t which is good or for disse minating that which is evi l. It m ay be used to defend a throne or to overthrow it, to prote ct rel igion or to destro y it, to m aintain law and order or to creat e anarch y. Now, there was, as we have seen, from the beginning, besides the writt en char ges, an oral tradit ion in Masonry, after the manner of the Caba la, on which the guidanc e of the socie ty depended. The true charac ter of an y form of Free masonr y is thus not to be judged only by its printed ritua l, but b y the oral instruction of the in itiates and the int erpreta tions placed on the symbols and ritu al. Natura lly these int erpreta tions var y in different countr ies and at different periods. Free masonr y is described in its Ritu al as \"a peculiar system of mor ality, veiled in allegor y and il lustrat ed by symbols.\" But what code of morality?

M. Paul Nourrisson is therefore perfect ly right in sa ying: \"There are as ma ny Masonries as countr ies; ther e is no such thing as universal Masonr y.\" 660 Broadl y, however , modern Freemasonr y may be divided into two kinds: the varie ty worked in the Brit ish Em pire, in America, Holland, Sweden, Denm ark, et c., and Grand Orient Masonr y, which prevai ls in Catho lic countries and of which the most impor tant centre is the Grand Orient of Paris. C ONTIN ENTAL M ASONR Y The fact that Masonr y in Protest ant countr ies is nei ther revolu tionar y nor anti- religious is frequen tly used b y Catho lic writers to show that Protestantis m ident ifies i tself with the aims of Ma sonry, and b y Freem asons to prove that the t yranny of the Church of Rom e has driven Masonry into an at titude hostil e to Church and State. The point overlooked in both these conten tions is the essential differenc e in th e chara cter of the two kinds of Masonr y. If the Grand Orient had adher ed to th e funda mental princip le of Brit ish Masonr y not to concern itse lf with religion or polit ics, there is no reason wh y it should have come into confl ict with the Church. But its duplici ty on this point is apparen t. Thus in one of its ear lier manuals i t decl ares, lik e Brit ish Ma sonry, that it \"never interferes with questions of governm ent or of civil and rel igious leg islation, and tha t whilst m aking i ts members part icipate in the perfe cting of all sciences, i t positive ly excepts in the lodges two of the most beau tiful, politics and theology , because th ese two sciences divide men and nations which Masonr y constant ly tends to unite.\" 661 But on a further page of the same manual from which this quotat ion is taken we find it stated that Masonry is simply \"the polit ical appli cation of Christi anity.\" 662 Indeed, during the last fift y years the Grand Orient has thrown of f the m ask and openl y declared itself to be poli tical in its ai ms. In October 1887 the Venerable Bro ∴ Blanc said in a discourse which was prin ted for the lodges: You recognise with m e, my brothers, the necessit y for F reemasonr y to beco me a vast and powerful politi cal and social society having a dec isive influence on the resolutions of the Republ ican governm ent. 663 And in 1890 the Freem ason Fernand Maurice dec lared \"that nothing should happen in France without th e hidden action of Freem asonr y,\" and \"if the Masons choose to organiz e, in ten y ears' ti me no one in France will be abl e to m ove outside us ( personne ne bougera plus en France en dehors de nous ).\" 664 This is the despotic power which the Grand Orient has establ ished in oppo sition to both Church and G overn ment."},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"Moreover , Grand Orient masonr y is not only political but subversive in its pol itical aims.

In the m atter of liber ty we read further tha t as m en are all by natur e free- -the old fallac y of Rous seau and of the Declarat ion of the Rights of Man-- therefore \"no one is necessaril y subjected to another nor has the righ t to rul e him.\" 666 The revolu tionar y expresses the sa me idea in the phrase that \"no m an should have a ma ster.\" Final ly, by fraternit y Grand Orient Masonr y denotes the abol ition of all nationa l feel ing. It is to Masonr y [Ragon says aga in] that we owe the af filiation of al l classes of socie ty, it alone could bring about this fusion which fro m its m idst has passed into the life of th e peopl es. It alone could promu lgate that hum anitarian law of which the rising ac tivity, tending to a great social unifor mity, leads to the fusion of rac es, of dif ferent classes, of morals, codes, custo ms, langu ages, fashions, mo ney, and m easures. Its vir tuous propagand a will beco me the hu manitarian law of all consciences. 667 The polic y of the Grand Orient is thus avowedl y Intern ational Socia lism. Indeed in a further passage Ragon pla inly indicates this fac t: Every generous refor m, every social benefi t derives from it, and if these survive it is because Masonr y lends the m its support. This pheno menon is due onl y to the power of i ts organiz ation. The past be longs to it and the future cannot escape from it. By its immense lever of associat ion it alone is able to real ize by a productive communion ( communion génératri ce ) that grea t and beau tiful social unity conc eived by Jaurez, Saint- Simon, Owen, Fourier . If Ma sons wish it, the generous concep tions of these philanthrop ic think ers will cease to be vain Utopias. 668 Who are the philanthrop ic thinkers enu merated here but th e men derisivel y described by Karl Marx as the \"Utopian Socialists\" of th e ninet eenth centur y? Utopian Socia lism is thus si mply the open and visible expression of Grand Orient Freemasonr y. Moreover , these Utopian Socia lists were a lmost withou t excep tion Free masons or me mbers of oth er secre t societ ies. The Freem ason Clav el conf irms the foregoing accoun t by Ragon. Thus, lik e Ragon, he quotes, the princ iple expres sed in a ritu al for the ini tiation of a Master Mason: It is expres sly forbidden to Masons to discuss am ongst th emselves, either in the lodge or outside it, religious and polit ical matters, these discu ssions having usually the effect of creating discord where for merly peac e, union, and fraterni ty reigned. This m asonic law admits of no excep tions. 669 But Clavel also goes on to sa y:"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"To efface amongst men the distinct ions of colour , rank, creed, opinions, countr y; to annih ilate fana ticism, and ... the scour ge of war; in a word, to make of the whole hu man race one and the sa me family united by affection, b y devotion, by work and knowledge: that, my brother , is the great work which Freemasonr y has undertak en, etc. 670 Up to a point m any a Brit ish Freemason read ing these passages will declare hi mself completely in accord with the senti ments expres sed. Humanitarianism, the obli teration of class dist inctions, fraterni zation between men of al l races, conditions, and relig ious creeds, enter of cour se largely into the spirit of British Masonr y, but for m simply the basis on which Masons me et togeth er in the lodges and not a poli tical system to be imposed on the world in general. British Masonr y thus ma kes no att empt to int erfere with the existing socia l system or form of G overn ment; the essence of its tea ching is th at each member of the Fraterni ty should seek to reform himself and not societ y. In a word, individu al regen eration takes the place of the social reor ganization advoca ted by the Grand Orient under the inf luence of Illu minism. The for mula of the \"United Sta tes of Europe\" and of the \"Universal Republ ic\" first proclai med by the Illu minatus, Anacharsis Cloot z, 671 has long been the slogan of the French lodges. 672 In the matter of rel igion, Grand Orient Masonr y has entire ly depart ed fro m the princ iple laid down b y the Bri tish lodges. If the Cathol ic Church has s hown itself hostile to Masonr y, it must be re membered that in Catho lic countries Masonr y has sho wn itself militantly anti- Cathol ic. \"Free masonr y,\" one of its mod ern orators dec lared, \"is the ant i- Church, the ant i-Cathol icism, the Church of Heres y ( la contr e Eglise, le contre Cathol icisme, l'Eglise de l'Hérésie ).\" 673 The Bulletin of the Grand Orient in 1885 officially declared: \"We Free masons must pursue the def inite demolition of Cathol icism.\" But the Grand Orient goes further than this and at tacks a ll forms of rel igion. Thus, as has been said, those \"anc ient landmarks\" of British Masonr y, belief in th e Great Archite ct of the Universe and in the immortality of the soul, had never for med an integr al par t of its system, and it was onl y in 1849 that for the first time \"it was distinc tly formu lated tha t the basis of Freem asonr y is a belief in God and in the immortality of th e soul, and the solidar ity of H umanity.\" But in Septe mber 1877 th e first part of this for mula was delet ed, all allusions to the Great Architect were o mitted, and the statute now reads: \"Its basis is absolut e liberty of consci ence and the solid arity of H umanity.\" 674 British Free masonr y, which does not admit liber ty of consci ence in the sense of Atheism , but demands tha t every Mason should profess beli ef in so me form of relig ion and which insists that the Volum e of the Sacred L aw--in England the Bible, in Mohammedan countri es the Koran, and so on--should be pl aced on the tab le in its lodges, ther eupon broke of f all rela tions with the Grand Orient. In March 1878 the fol lowing resolut ion was pas sed unan imously: That the Grand Lodge, whilst alwa ys anxious to rec eive in the most fraterna l spirit the Brethr en of an y foreign Grand Lodge whose proceed ings are conduc ted ac cording to the Ancien t Land marks of the Order, of w hich a bel ief in T.G.A.O.T .U. is the first and mos t"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"impor tant, cannot recogniz e as \"true and genuine\" Brethren an y who have been in itiated in lodges which ei ther den y or ignore tha t beli ef. 675 The Grand Orient, says M.

Thus in 1902 the Freem ason Delpe ch in his discourse at a m asoni c banque t uttered th ese word s: The triumph of the Gali lean has lasted twent y centur ies; he is d ying in his turn. The mysterious voice which once on th e mounta ins of Epirus announc ed the death of Pan, to- day announces the death of the dece iver God who had prom ised an era of ju stice and peace to those who s hould believe in hi m. The il lusion has last ed ver y long; the lying God in his turn disappears; he goes to rejoin in the dust of ages the other divin ities of India, Egypt, Greece, and Ro me, who sa w so m any deluded cre atures throw the mselves at the food of th eir al tars. Free masons, we are pleased to state that we are not unconc erned with this ruin of false prophets. The Ro man Church, founded on th e Galilean myth, began to dec line rapidl y on the da y when the masonic association was consti tuted. From the pol itical point of view Freemasons have often varied. But in al l times Free masonr y has stood firm on this principl e: war on al l superstit ions, war on all fanaticism. 677 How is it possible to reconci le this att itude towards religion in genera l and Christiani ty in particular with the fact that the Grand Orient still works the Rose-Croix degree? This degre e--which, as we have seen, wa s first devised (whether in Scotland or in France) to give a Christi an meaning to Masonr y--was onl y incorpora ted in to Brit ish Freem asonr y in 1846 and in our countr y has ret ained its origin al char acter. Its ri tual, centring around a lost word, signifi es that the Old Testament dispensat ion has co me to an end with the Crucif ixion, and is s o strongl y Christian that no Je w, Moha mmedan, or oth er non- Christi an can be ad mitted to it. Moreove r, since this degree, known as the eight eenth degre e, for ms in rea lity the first degree of the Ancient and Accept ed Rite, as worked in this countr y, non-Christ ians are exc luded from the whole of this Rite and can only take the degrees of Ro yal Arch, Mark Mason, Ro yal Ark Marine r, and fina lly Royal Selec t and Super -Exce llent Master . Consequen tly the thirty-three Masons of the thirty-third degre e who co mpose th e Suprem e Council which directs the Ancient and Accept ed Rit e are necessarily professing Christi ans. Exact ly the opposite is th e case in France; the Rose- Croix, worked by profe ssing a theists and Jews, can onl y be parod y of Christi an mysteries. Now, it is essenti al to real ize that in France the anti- masonic camp is div ided in to two parties. Whilst the m ajority of Cathol ic writers regard Free masonr y itself as the source of all evil--\"the Synagogue of Satan\"- -more impartial invest igators have pronounced th e opinion that it is not Freem asonr y even of the Grand Orient varie ty but so mething concealed behind Free masonr y which consti tutes the princip al dange r.

There was a delega te from Adela ide who spoke a good dea l, but the Chair man specif ically mentioned England as taking no part in th e movement. Later on, in a Report of the Board of General Purpo ses to Grand Lodg e on March 2, 1921, a l etter from Lord Ampthi ll, pro G rand Master, appears, dec lining an invi tation from the Swiss Grand Lodge Alpina to Brit ish Freem asons to at tend an Internat ional Masonic Congress in Geneva and quoting the following letter fro m the Grand Secre tary as an ear lier preceden t for this refusal: I am direc ted to state, in reply to the invi tation to attend an Interna tional Masonic Conferen ce in Switzerland during the coming autumn, that th e United Grand Lodge of England will be unable to send represent atives on the occ asion. It never parti cipates in a Masonic ga thering in which are treat ed as an open question what i t has alwa ys held to be ancient and essentia l Land marks of the Craf t, these being an express bel ief in the Great Archit ect of the Universe, and an obliga tory recogn ition of the Volum e of the Sacred Law. Its refusal to remain in fratern al associa tion with such Sovereign Jurisdict ions as have repudiat ed or m ade ligh t of these Landm arks has long been upon record, and its resolve in this regard remains un shaken. Lord Ampthi ll then went on to say: A further consequence of certa in happen ings of the war is to make more firm our resolve to keep, as far as in us lies, Freem asonr y strictly away from parti cipation in polit ics, either na tional or intern ational. This a ttitude of aloofn ess from necessaril y controversia l affairs of State, on w hich Brethren can leg itimately and m ost properl y differ, has ever been maintained by our Grand Lodge since it was first conven ed in 1717. Because of this, it held aloof fro m such in ternat ional conferenc es as were s ummoned during the war; and never more than now has the necessit y for the m aintenance of this att itude been fel t by British Free masons.... For these reasons, the invit ation to parti cipate in the proposed Intern ational Conferen ce of Free masons at Geneva cannot be accept ed. Such an asse mbly might be term ed inform al, but inev itably it would be regarded as opening a door to compro mise on those things which this Grand Lodge has alwa ys held to be essenti als. Such a comprom ise English Free masonr y will never conte mplate. On these essent ials we take the firm stand we have alwa ys done; we cannot detract from full recogni tion of th e Great Archit ect of the Universe, and we s hall cont inue to forbid the introduct ion of political discussion in to our Lodges. British Masonr y has thus t aken a firm stand aga inst the Grand O rient. But it is regre ttable that views so adm irably expressed should be confined to masonic correspondence and not made more apparent to the world in genera l. On the Cont inent, outside m asoni c circ les, the differenc e between British Masonr y and the Grand O rient vari ety is not sufficien tly known, and the retic ence of leading British Masons on this sub ject has not onl y played into the hand s of th e intra ctable ant i-Masons, w ho dec lare all Masonr y to be harm ful, but has strength ened the position of the revolu tionari es who u se Masonr y for a subversive purpose. Thus in the Portuguese revolu tion of 1920 the Mason s of tha t countr y who were"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"directing the m ovement sheltered themselves behind the good na me of England. \"How can you accuse th e lodges of being murder c lubs,\" the y said to the peop le, \"when Masonr y is direc ted by Engl and and had King Edward for its Grand Master?\" However ludi crous all this m ay seem to the British public, yet for the honour of our countr y such accusat ions s hould not re main unrefut ed. A witness of the disorders that took place in Portugal declar ed to the present writ er that if onl y Grand Lodge of Engl and would have published a notice in the Continent al press disassociat ing itse lf fro m the Grand Orient in genera l and fro m Portuguese Free masonr y in parti cular, the power of the revolu tionar ies would have been i mmensely weaken ed and th e anti- British and pro- German propaganda then circu lating in the countr y defeat ed. But Bri tish Free masonr y preferr ed to m aintain an a ttitude of aloofn ess, con tenting itself with issuing period ical warnings aga inst the Grand Orient priva tely to the lodges. This polic y has done much to damage not onl y the good nam e of England but of British Masonr y in the eyes of the outside world, and part icularly in those of Ro man Catholi cs, which is the m ore regrett able since Free masonr y and the Rom an Catho lic Church are the only two o rganized bodies in this coun try which rea lly exercise disc ipline over the ir members and forbid them to belong to subver sive secret societies; hence they provide the two strongest bulwark s aga inst the occul t forces of revolu tion. For this reason, as we s hall see later, they are the two bodi es which are th e most fear ed by the recruit ing agen ts of these societies. But in the case of Free masonr y the fact is unfortunat ely too little known to the world in gener al. As a singular ly broad- minded Jesuit has recent ly expressed it : The anti- clerical and revolut ionar y activities of Continent al Free masonr y did not begin when the Grand Orient fina lly abolished God. During a cen tury and m ore these ev il forces had been at work. Neverth eless Engl ish Ma sons onl y shrugged the ir shoulders and looked another way, though the true char acter of foreign Masonr y was brought to the ir notice in such book s as tha t of John Robison, Proofs of a Con spiracy against all the Religions and G overnments of Europe .... No doubt [the same writer says aga in] ther e has been a t times a deplor able amount of exagg eration among Continent al Catho lics in attr ibuting all the m oral and socia l evils of the world to the insidious workings of Freem asonr y.... But so long as English Free masons resolut ely avert their gaze from the anti- religious and anti- social activ ities of their Contin ental brethren there can be no hope of an y better understand ing. 692 It is im possible to den y the truth of these strictur es. As has alr eady been pointed out in the course of th is book, British Free masons have frequent ly not only ignored Robison 's warning but vilif ied hi m as the enem y of Masonr y, although he never attacked their Order but only the perverted systems of the Contin ent; too often also the y have exonera ted the most dangerous secret societies, notabl y the Illu minati, bec ause, apparen tly from a mistaken sense of lo yalty, they conc eive it the ir dut y to defend an y association of a masoni c chara cter. This is si mply suicida l. Brit ish Ma sonry has no bit terer enemies than"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"the secret societies working for s ubversion, which, from the Illuminati onwards, have always regard ed honest Masonr y with cont empt and used its doctr ines for an ul terior purpose. It is eas y to see how these doc trines m ay be pervert ed to an end direc tly oppo sed to that which British Mason s have in view . Thus, for exa mple, the id ea of the brotherhood of man in the sense of love for al l humanity is the essence of Christi anity--\"Be kindl y affectioned one to anoth er with brotherl y love; in honour preferring one anothe r.\" In adopt ing \"brother ly love\" as a part of th eir sacred trilog y British Masons adopt an entire ly Christi an standpoin t. But if by the brotherhood of m an is me ant that men of ever y race are equall y related and that therefore one owe s the sam e duty to foreign ers as to one's fellow-countr ymen it is obvious that all nationa l feel ing m ust vanish. The Brit ish Freemason does not, of course, int erpret the theor y in this manner; he cannot seriousl y regard himself as the brother of the Ba mbute pygmy or the Pol ynesian cannib al, thus he uses the t erm merely in a vague and theore tical sense. What indeed does the word \"brother\" literally mean? If we consult the dictionar y we shall see it defined as \"a m ale born of the same paren ts; an yone closel y united with or resembling one another; associated in co mmon interests, occupa tion,\" et c. It is therefore obviousl y absurd to sa y that men of such dif feren t races as those referred to are brothers; they are not born of the sa me kind of parents, they are not united in the ir aims, they do not remotely resemble one ano ther, and they are not associat ed in co mmon in terests and occup ations. Though th ese happen to be extre me cases, there are neverthe less es sential differen ces between men of th e sam e zone and cl imate. The English man and the French man are not brothers because they do not see life from the same point of view , but that is no reason wh y they should not be close allies. The brotherhood of m an, if tak en literally, is therefore a mislead ing ter m, nor is such a relationship necessar y to th e peac e of the world. Cain and Abel were not better friends, for being brothers. David and Jonath an, on the other hand, were not brothers but devoted friends. In striving aft er universal brotherhood in a literal sense, Freemasons are ther efore pursuing a chim era. The most dangerous fal lacy to which de mocracy, under the influenc e of Illu minized Freemasonr y, has succum bed is that peace between nat ions can be brought about by means of Internat ionalism, that is to sa y, by the destruct ion of nat ional feeling. Yet a man is not more likely to live at pea ce with his neighbours because he is devoid of natur al affection; on the con trary, the good brother , the devot ed fath er, is m ost likel y to beco me the faithfu l friend. Perm anent peace between nations will probabl y never be ensured, but the only basis on which such a situation can conc eivabl y be estab lished is the basis of sane Nat ionalis m--an understand ing between the patr iotic and vir ile elements in ever y countr y which, because they value their own liber ties and revere the ir own tradi tions, are able to respec t those of oth er nations. Internat ionalism is an understand ing between the decadent elements in ea ch countr y--the consci entious objectors, the drawing-roo m Socia lists, the visionaries- -who shirk the realities of life and, as the Socia list Karl Kautsk y in a description of Ideal ists has adm irably expressed it, \"see onl y differences of"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"opinion and m isappr ehension where th ere are actua lly irreconci lable antagon isms.\" This is wh y at times of cr isis Idealists are of all men the m ost dangerous and Pacifists th e great promoters of war s. Understanding between nations is wholl y desirable, but the destruc tion of th e nation al spirit ever ywhere can onl y lead to the weaken ing of al l countr ies where this proces s takes plac e and the triumph of the na tions who refuse to accept the sa me principl e. It will perhaps be answered that Freemasons do not bel ieve in the doctrine of brotherhood betwe en all men, but onl y between Mason s of al l races. But this m ay lead no less to national disintegra tion if it creates a nation within ea ch nat ion, an in ternat ional fraterni ty indep endent of the countr ies to which its m embers belong. The logica l outco me of th is may be tha t a man will refuse to fight for his countr y against his brother Masons--it is what has happen ed in France. The Grand Orient was before the recent war the great breed ing-ground of ant i-patrio tism, where all schem es for nat ional defence were discourag ed. Before 1870 the sa me thing took place, and it was in the m asonic lodges that Ger many found her mos t valu able allies. In the same way the doctrin e of the perfect ibility of hu man nature lends itself to perversion. Nothing could be mo re desirable than tha t man should strive aft er perfec tion. Did not Christ enjoin His disciples: \"Be y e therefore perfe ct, even as your Father which is in Heaven is perfec t\"? Man is ther efore ac ting in accordan ce with Christian principl es in seeking after divine perfection. But when he co mes to bel ieve that he has alread y attained it he m akes of him self a god. \"If I j ustify myself,\" said Job, \" mine own mo uth shall conde mn me; if I sa y I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.\" And St. John: \"If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\" More than th is, if we seek perfe ction in others we dec eive ourselves equal ly and m ake gods of me n. This is precisely the conclusion at which perverted Freemasonr y and th e forms of Social ism deriv ing fro m it arriv e. Hum an natur e, the y say, is itself divine; what need then for other divin ities? The Catho lic Church is consequent ly quite right in decl aring that th e doctrin e of the perfect ibility of hum an natur e leads to the de ification of hum anity in tha t it puts humanity in the pl ace of G od. The Grand Orien t, which defin itely accepts this doc trine, has ther efore logi cally erased the na me of the Great Archi tect of the Universe from its ritual and has beco me an associat ion of Freeth inkers and Atheists. Is it necessar y to point out the folly as wel l as the crim e of this delusion- -the ludi crous inconsequ ence of me n who divini ze hu manity yet revile what they call \"socie ty\"? All the evils of the world, th ey declare, are not to be found in nature but in \"man-m ade laws,\" in the institu tions of \"socie ty.\" Yet what is socie ty but th e outco me of hu man wills, of human aspirat ions? Societ y may be, and no doubt is, in need of refor mation, but are not its imperfe ctions the creation of i mperfec t beings? It is true th at to- day the world is in a state of chaos, industri al chaos, polit ical chaos, social chaos, relig ious chaos. Ever ywhere men are losing faith in the causes the y are supposed to represent; authorit y questions its own right to govern, de mocracy is rent with div isions, the rul ing classes are abdica ting in favour of un scrupulous de magogues, the ministers of religion barter their faith for popular ity."},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"And what has brought th e world to th is pas s?

M eanwhi le, by the support it lends to Socia lism it encourag es the cl ass war inste ad of the brotherhood betwe en men of all rank s and conditions which it profe sses to advoc ate. British Freemasonr y, on the other hand, whilst not interpr eting brotherhood in a poli tical sense, never theless contr ibutes to social peace. At the annual confer ence of the Labour Party in 1923 a propo sal was made by the extre me section that \"any person who is a Free m ason should be excluded from any kind of office,\" it being suggested that \"in cases where an understand ing has been reached between Trade Union leaders and employers, thus preven ting or l imiting industr ial trouble, the secret has been the bond of Free masonr y.\" 693 Whether this was the case or not, British Masonr y, by taking its stand on pa triotism and respec t for relig ion, nec essarily tends to unite men of al l classes and therefore offers a formidable bulwark against the forces of revolution. Any attacks on Brit ish Ma sonry as at present constitu ted and directed are th erefore absolutely oppo sed to the interests of the countr y. But at the same time it behoves Mason s to beware of the insidious att empts that are being m ade by irregu lar secre t societ ies to infiltr ate the Craft and pervert its true princ iples. The present satisfa ctory condi tion of Freemasonr y in Eng land is owing not only to its estab lished statu tes, but to the char acter of the men who control it--m en who are not, as in eigh teenth-centur y France, m ere figureh eads, but the real directors of the Order . Should the contro l ever pass into the wrong hands and the agents of secre t socie ties succe ed in cap turing a num ber of the lodges, this great stabi lizing force might become a giganti c engine of destruct ion. Ho w insid iously these efforts are being made we shall see in the next chapte r. 12.

The reason for this is obvious: not only do the doctr ines of Free masonr y lend the mselves to perversion, but th e train ing provided in the Lodges makes an ad mirable prepara tion for in itiation into other secret systems. The man who has learn t to m aintain silen ce even on w hat may appear to him as triv ialities, w ho is willing to submit to mystification, to ask no questions, and to recogniz e the authori ty of superiors whom he is in no wa y legal ly oblig ed to obe y, who ha s, moreover , beco me imbued with the esprit de corp s which binds him to his fellow-m embers in a common cause, is natural ly a better subject for the secret societ y adept than the free lan ce who is liable to assert his indep endence at an y moment. Perhaps the m ost important fac tor, however , is the natur e of the mason ic oaths. These terrib le pena lties, which m any Freemasons th emselves regret as a surviva l of barbaris m and which have in fac t been abolished in th e higher degrees, have done mu ch to creat e prejudice against Free masonr y, whilst at the same time they provide an addit ional incent ive to outside in triguers. In the opinion of M. Copin Albanc elli, the abolit ion of the oath would go far to prevent penetration of Brit ish Ma sonry by the secret societies. Now, by their obligat ions British Freemasons are forbidden to join these irr egular socie ties, not only because their principl es are in conflic t with those of orthodox Masonr y, but bec ause in m ost cases the y admit women. According to the ruling of Grand Lodge, \"any member working under the Engl ish Jurisdi ction ... violat es his Obligat ion b y being present at or assisting in assemblies professing to be Ma sonic which are attend ed by wom en.\" Warnings to this ef fect have been frequentl y given in the Lodg es; on Septe mber 3, 1919, th e Board of Genera l Purpo ses issued the following report: The Board' s attention is being increasing ly drawn to sedulous ende avours w hich are being made by certa in bodies unrecogn ized as Ma sonic by the United Grand Lodge of England, to induce Free masons to join in their assemblies.

Guénon quotes la ter, indica tes a further source of inspira tion: \"For m e, Jesus Christ, that is to sa y the Man-G od of the Christians, cop y of the Avatars of all countr ies, of the Hindu Chrishna as of the Eg yptian Horus, was never a historica l personage.\" Hence the story of Hi s life was me rely an al legor y founded on the exist ence of \"a personage named Jeho shua born at Lud.\" But elsewhere she asserted that Jesus m ay have lived during the Christian era or a cen tury earlier \" as the Sepher T oldoth Jehoshua indicates \" (my italics). And Mada me Blava tsky went on to sa y of the savants who den y the historic al valu e of this legend, tha t they-- either l ie or ta lk nonsense. It is our Masters who affirm it [my italics]. If th e histor y of Jehoshua or Jesu s Ben Pandera is false, then the whole of the Talmud, the whole of the"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Jewish canon law , is false. It was the disciple of Jehoshua Ben Parachi a, the fifth President of the Sanhedr im since Ezra, who re- wrote the Bib le.... This stor y is much truer than that of the New Testam ent, of which histor y does not sa y a word. 702 Who were the Masters who se authorit y Madam e Blavatsk y here invokes? Clearly not the Trans-Hi malayan Brotherhood to whom she hab itually refers b y this term, and who can certainly not be suspect ed of af firming the authent icity of the Toldoth Yeshu. It is evident, then, that there were other \"Masters\" fro m whom Madame Blav atsky received th is teaching, and that those other masters were Caba lists. The same Judaic influenc e appears more strongl y in a book published by the Theosophi cal Society in 1903, where the Talmud and th e Toledot Yeshu are quoted at great leng th and the Christians are derided for resenting the at tacks on the ir faith contained in these book s, whilst the Jew s are represented as innocent, persecuted victims. One passage will suffice to give an id ea of the author's point of vi ew: The Christ [said the mystics] was born \"of a vir gin\"; the unwitting believ er in Jesus as the histori cal Messiah in the exclusive Jewish sense, and in his being the Son of G od, na y God Hims elf, in course of ti me asserted that Mary was tha t virgin; whereupon Rabbini cal logic, which in this case was simple and co mmon logi c, met this extr avaganc e by the natur al retort tha t, seeing that his paterni ty was unacknowledged, Jesus was therefore illegitimate, a bastard [ mamzer ]. 703 It is obviousl y, then, less from Thibet an Mahat mas, Hindu S wamis, Sikh Guru s, or Egyptian Brothers than fro m Jewish Caba lists tha t these leaders of Theosoph y have borrowed the ir ideas on Je sus Christ. As the Jewish writer Adolphe Franck has trul y observed: \"Dès qu'il est question de théosophie, on est sûr de voir appara ître la Kabbal e.\" 704 And he goes on to show the dire ct inf luence of Cabal ism on the mod ern Theosophi cal Society. Mrs. Besant, without endorsing the worst blasphe mies of the Toledot Yeshu, neverthe less reflected this and other Judaic tradit ions in her book Esoteri c Christiani ty , where she related that Jesus wa s brought up am ongst the Essenes, and that later He went to Egypt, where He bec ame an init iate of the great esoteric lodge--tha t is to sa y, the Great White Lodge- -from which a ll grea t religions derive. It will be seen tha t this is onl y a version of the old stor y of the Talmudists and Cabalists, perpe tuated by the Gnostics, the Rosicruc ians, and the ninet eenth- centur y Ordre du Temple . 705 But according to one of Mrs. Besant' s Theosophi cal antagonists, her doctrine \"rests on a perpetu al equ ivocat ion,\" and whilst allowing the Eng lish public to bel ieve that when she spoke of the coming Christ she referred to the Christ of the Go spels, she stated to her int imates what Mr . Leadbeat er taugh t in his book The Inner Life , nam ely, that the Christ of the Gospels never existed, but was an inven tion of the m onks of the second centur y. 706 It should be understood, however , that in the language of the Theosophists, led by Mrs. Besant and Mr. Leadbea ter, Jesus and \"the Christ\" are two separa te and distinct individu alities, and that when the y now speak of \"the Christ\" th ey refer to som eone l iving in a bungalow in the Him alayas with whom Mr. Leadbea ter has int erviews to arrang e about his"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"approa ching adven t. 707 Portraits of th is person have been distributed amongst the members of \"The Star in the East,\" an Order founded at Benar es in 191 1 by Mr. Leadbeat er and J.

Whether Mrs. Besant, who had begun her career as a Freethinke r, retained so me lingering belief in her earl ier cre ed at the time she entered into rel ations with the Order , or whether she saw in this m aterialistic socie ty a valuable concre te organiz ation for the disse mination of her new esoteri c theori es, it is im possible to know . At an y rate, she rose rapid ly through the succeed ing degrees and beca me before long Vice President of the Suprême Conseil , which appoint ed her i ts nationa l delegate to Great Brita in. It was in this capacity that she founded the English branch of the Order under the na me of Co-Masonr y (that is, ad mitting both sexes) at the Lodg e \"Hum an Dut y\" in London, which was consecra ted on Septem ber 26, 1902, and lat er founded anoth er lodge at Adyar in India, named \"The Rising Sun.\" The nu mber of lodges on the Grand Rol l of Co-Masonr y, including those abroad, is now said to be no less than 442. Co-Masonr y thus receiv es a two-fold dir ection, for whilst re maining in constant correspondenc e with the Suprême Conseil Universel Mix te , situa ted at 5 Rue Jules-Breton in Paris and presided over by the Grand Master Piron, with Madam e Amélie Gédalje, thirty-third degree, as G rand Secretar y-General, i t rece ives further instructions from \"the V ∴ Ill ∴ Bro ∴ Annie Besant 33°\" a t Adyar. In order not to shock the susceptib ilities of English adepts who m ight be repe lled by the rat ionalist tend encies of the Maçonneri e Mixte, Mrs. Besant has, ho wever , borrowed the for mulas of Brit ish Ma sonry together with its custo m of placing the V.S.L. on the table in th e lodges. These conflic ting doctr ines are blended in an amusing manner on th e cert ificates of the Order , where at the top we find the French motto and init ials: Liberté Égal ité Fraternité À ∴ L ∴ G ∴ D ∴ L'H ∴ (i.e. à la gloir e de l'Hu manité) and below , for the benefit of English m embers, the initials of the British mason ic dev ice, that does not of course appear on the diplo mas of the French Order, which, like the Grand Orient, has re jected the Great Archite ct: T ∴ T ∴ G ∴ O ∴ T ∴ G ∴ A ∴ O ∴ T ∴ U ∴ (To the glory of the Great Architect of the Universe). Our Co-Mason s ther efore enjo y the advantage of being ab le to choose w hether the y shall render glory to God or to Hu manity. That the two devices are som ewhat incom patible does not appear to strike the English in itiates, nor do the y probabl y realize the imposture practised on the m by the further wording of th e cert ificate, which, after announcing in imposing capitals \"T o all Mason s dispersed over both He mispheres, Greeting,\" goes on to say \"We therefor e reco mmend him ( or her) as such to al l Free masons of the Globe, request ing the m to recogn ize him ( or her) in al l the rights and priv ileges attached to this Degree, as we will do to all present ing the mselves under similar circu mstances.\""},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"Now, any British Ma son will see at a glanc e that all this is a fa lse pretension. No order of Masonr y can reco mmend its m embers for rights and privileg es to \"all the Freemasons of the world,\" for the si mple reason that, as has been said, there is no such thing as \"Universal Masonry,\" so that even Grand Lodge of Engl and--the most import ant Lodge in the world--could not, if it would, accord the right of entr y for its me mbers into Contin ental lodges. As an Eng lish Mason recent ly expressed it : The impression a mong non-Mason s genera lly appears to be that a British or Irish m ember of the Craft is ab le to enter a mason ic lodge in an y part of the world and take part in its deliberations and proce edings. To this beli ef an unqua lified denia l may at once be given. Nor m ay a me mber of a lodge under an y Jurisdict ion not in com munion with th e Grand Lodges of the United Kingdom be rec eived as a visitor or as a Joining Mem ber in any subsidiar y lodge of the Grand Lodges of England, Ireland, or Scotland. 708 But for Co-Ma sonry to make this clai m is even more ridi culous, since at the time when the above quoted diplo ma was drawn up Co-Ma sonry and its parent, the Maçonner ie Mixte, were not recogn ized by any other order of Ma sonry except th e \"Droit Hu main,\" and it is not only unrecogniz ed but utterl y repudiat ed by Grand Lodge of England. The British Mason, in fact, does not recogni ze the Co-Ma son as a Mason at all, and would violate his obliga tions b y discussing m asonic secrets with him or her , so that ther e is no manner in which the Co-Mason could be accorded mason ic rights and privi leges b y British Mason s. In order , further , to keep up the illusion in the minds of its m embers tha t they are genuin e Mason s, Co-Masonr y, in its quarter ly organ, The Co-Mason , is careful to include m asonic news rela ting to British Masonr y as if it form ed one and the same order . With regard to the Grand Orient, an equa lly tortuous polic y was pursued. As we have already seen, the Grande Loge disgraced the lodge that had ad mitted Maria Derais mes and did not of ficially recogniz e the Maçonnerie Mixte. The ritual adopted by the la tter Order was, ho weve r, not th at of Bri tish Masonr y, and in m ost Co-Ma sonic Lodges the ritual employed contains variat ions derived from the Grand Orient 709 ; indeed th e Grand Orient charac ter of Co-Masonr y has alwa ys been general ly recogni zed in mason ic circles. This being so, I pointed out in World Revolution that Co-Masonr y derives fro m the Grand Orient, but I rece ived the following protest fro m a wom an Co-Mason: Are y ou aware that for twent y years the Grand O rient has refused to recogniz e it [Co- Masonr y] as a legi timate body, just as the English Orthodox Masons do no w? Also, we are distinc tly told before joining that we shal l not be recognized by that body. Also, we have nothing to do with Illu minati, or with Germ any. As the Grand Orient have eliminated the Deit y, it is rather a dreadful thing to a Ma son to be connec ted in any way with that Order, and I cannot imagine a worse thing could be said about us. This letter was dated March 6, 1922, and on the 19th of the prec eding m onth of Februar y an alliance between the Grand O rient and Co-Ma sonry had been final ly celebrat ed at the Grand Temple of the Droit Hum ain in Paris! We find a report of this cere mony in th e Co- Mason for the fol lowing April. It is eviden t, ther efore, tha t members who were like ly to be repelled by the idea of connex ion with the Grand Orient were as sured that no such"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"connex ion existed. But when this covert liaison developed into official recogni tion-- although this did not inc lude the right of entr y to the lodges of the Grand Orient for women members--the triumphant manner in which the great even t was announced in the Co-Mason suggests tha t the major ity of me mbers were likel y to feel nothing but satisfa ction at associa tion with the Order tha t \"had el iminated the Deit y.\" It is tru e that a few m embers protested, and b y this t ime Co-Ma sonry was too co mpletely under the contro l of Mrs. Be sant for an y faction to question her dicta tes. Moreover , the opposition had been weakened by a schism which took place in the Order in 1908, when a nu mber of members who ob jected to the introdu ction of Eastern occult ism into Masonry and likewise disapproved of the Grand Orient, form ed the mselves in to a separa te bod y under Mrs. Halse y and Dr . Geikie Cobb, working onl y the Craft Degrees according to the Grand Lodge of England. It has been sho wn by this brief résu mé that Co-Ma sonry is a hybrid system deriv ing fro m two confl icting sources--the politi cal and ration alist doctrines of the Maçonneri e Mixt e and the Eastern occul tism of Mada me Blav atsky and Mrs. Besant. As a profes sing Buddhist, Mada me Blava tsky consistentl y dissociated herself fro m any schemes of ma terial welfare. Thus in the ear ly Constitu tion of the Theosophica l Socie ty it is stat ed: \"The Societ y repudiat es all interfer ence on its behalf with the Govern mental rela tions of any nation or co mmunity, confin ing its a ttention exc lusivel y to the matters set forth in the present docum ent.\" 710 These matters rela te to the stud y of Occul t Scienc es. Again Mada me Blav atsky herself wrote in the Theosophist : Unconcerned about politi cs: hostil e to the insane drea ms of Social ism and Co mmunism, which it abhors--as both are but disguised conspira cies of brut al force and selfishness against honest labour ; the Societ y cares but little abou t the outward hum an management of the material world. The whole of its aspirat ions are dire cted towards the occul t truths of the visible and invisib le worlds. 711 It will be seen that this decl aration is dia metrically opposed to tha t of the Maçonnerie Mixte. Neverthel ess, M adame Blav atsky so far depart ed fro m her purel y occu lt progra mme after her arrival in India in 1879 as to reconstruc t the societ y on the basis of \"Universal Brotherhood.\" This id ea was com pletely absent fro m her first sche me; \"the Brotherhood plank in the Socie ty's future pla tform ,\" wrote her coadjutor Colone l Olcot t, \"was not thought of.\" 712 It was over th is plank, however , that Mrs. Besant was able to walk to the Supre me Council of the Maçonner ie Mixte, and adding Liber ty and Equ ality to the princ iple of Fraternit y to estab lish Co-Masonr y on a defini tely polit ical basis as a prepar ation for the Socia list doctrines her teacher had \"abhorred.\" In the matter of esoter ic doc trines Mrs. Besant again depart ed fro m the path laid down b y Mada me Blava tsky, whose aim had been to rehabil itate Buddhis m in India, representing"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"the teach ings of Gauta ma Buddha as an advan ce on Hinduis m. 713 Mrs. Besant, however , came to regard the doctrines of the Brah mins as the purer faith. Yet it was neither Buddhis m nor Hinduism in a pure form that she introduc ed to th e Co-Mason s of the West, but an occult system of her own devising, wherein Mahat mas, Swamis, and Guru s were in congruousl y mingled with the char latans of eighteen th-cen tury France. Thus in the Co-Ma sonic lodges we find \"the King\" inscribed over the Grand Master's cha ir in the East, in the North the e mpty chair of \"the Master\"- -to which, unt il rec ently, all members were requ ired to bow in passing- -and over it a pictur e, vei led in some lodges, of the same mysterious personage. Should the neoph yte enquire, \"Who is the King?\" he ma y be told that he is th e King who is to co me from India- -whether he is identi cal with the young Hindu Krishna murti adopt ed by Mrs. Besant in 1909 is not clear --whilst the question \"Who is th e Master ?\" wil l probabl y be me t with the reply that he is \"th e Master of al l true Freemasons throughou t the world,\" which the enquirer tak es to m ean the head of the religion to which he happens to belong--Christ, Mohammed, or another . But in the third degre e the astonishing infor mation is confided with an appear ance of great secrecy that he is no other than the fa mous Com te de Saint-Ger main, who did not reall y die in 1784, but is still alive to-da y in Hungar y under the na me of Ragocsk y. In yet a high er degree, however , the ini tiate may be told that the Master is in real ity Prince Eugene of Austria. It would be superfluous to describe in det ail the wild nonsense th at composes the creed of Co-Masonr y, since a long series of art icles wa s recently devoted to the subject in The Patrio t and can be consult ed by anyone who desires infor mation concern ing its ceremonies and the personnel direc ting i t. 714 Suffice it to sa y here that its course, like that of most secret socie ties, has been marked by violent dissensions am ongst the members- - the Blava tsky-ites passionat ely denounc ing the Besantit es and the Besantit es proclai ming the divine infal libility of their leader --whilst at the same time scanda ls of a pecu liarly unsavour y kind have been brought to ligh t. This fac t has indeed creat ed a serious schis m in the ranks of the Theosophists, w hich shows that a number of perfect ly harmless people are to be found a mongst them. Yet the pecu liar recurrence of such scandals in the histor y of secre t societ ies leads one inevi tably to wonder how far these are to be regard ed as merely deplorable accid ents or as the results of secret- society methods and of occu lt teaching. That the men against who m char ges of sexual perversion were brought were not isolated exa mples of these tenden cies is shown b y a curious ad mission on the part of one of Mada me Blava tsky's \"che las,\" or discipl es, w ho re lates: I was a pupil of H .P.B. before Mrs. Besant joined the T.S. and saw her expel one of her most gifted and valued workers fro m the Esoter ic Sect ion for of fences aga inst the occul t and moral law, similar to those with which Mr . Leadbea ter's nam e has now been associa ted for near ly twent y years. H. P.B. was alwa ys extre mely strict on th is particu lar point, and many [my itals.] would-be aspirants for chel aship were refused on this one ground alon e, while others who had been ac cepted \"on probation\" failed almost immediately afterwards. 715 It would appear , then, tha t these deplorable procliv ities are pecu liarly preval ent amongst aspiran ts to Theosophica l knowledge."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"It is unnecessar y to enl arge at length on M rs. Besant's connexion with the seditious elements in this countr y and in India, since these have frequentl y been referr ed to in the press. It is true that the Theosophic al Soci ety, like th e Grand Orient, disavo ws al l poli tical intentions and profes ses to work onl y for s piritual develop ment, but the leaders appe ar to consider that a radic al chang e must take pla ce in the exist ing socia l system before true spiritu al develop ment can be att ained. That th is change would lie in the dire ction of Socia lism is suggested by the fac t that a group of le ading Theosophists, in cluding Mrs. Besant, were discovered in 1919 to be holding a large nu mber of shares in the Victoria House Printing Comp any, which was finan cing the Daily Herald at that date 716 ; indeed, Mrs. Besant in her lectur es on Liber ty, Equa lity, Fraterni ty, at the Queen's Hall in October of the same year, clearly indicated Socia lism as the system of the coming New Era. 717 Since then th e \"Action Lodge\" has been founded with the object of carr ying \"Theosophi cal ideals and concept ions into a ll fields of hum an activ ity\" 718 --from which the political field appe ars not to be excluded, since this lodge has been known to co-operate with the pro moters of a poli tical meeting on the Indian question. 719 It is int eresting to notice that a leading member of the \"Action Lodge,\" and also of the \"Order of the Star in the East,\" was recen tly repor ted in the press to have been long conne cted with the Labour Party and to have notified her int ention of standing for i t in Parl iament. This is, of cour se, not to sa y that all Theosophists are Socialists. The Theosophica l Socie ty of Amer ica, in an ad mirable series of art icles 720 discussing the theor y of world- revolu tion set forth in m y book s, poin ted out that: The pupils of the powers of evi l work ... untiring ly to thwart ever y real advan ce of th e human race, to pull down whatev er civi lization painful ly builds, tha t makes for light and true develop ment and spiritua l growth.... It would not be dif ficult to suggest reasons w hy these pupils and co- workers of the powers of darkness choose the chief clauses of the ir creed: Intern ationalism, Com munism, the destruc tion of the higher class through the despoti c rule of the lowest class, the corrupt ion of fa mily life. The attack on rel igion hardl y needs co mment. It will be seen, then, tha t Socia lism and Internat ionalism are not an essentia l part of Theosophi cal teach ing, and tha t the more enl ighten ed Theosophists recogni ze the danger of these destructiv e doctr ines. At a Special Convention in Engl and on April 6 of this y ear, seven Lodg es entered a protest against rec ent departures fro m the origin al pol icy of the Socie ty. Amongst the resolut ions put forward was one ur ging the President (Mrs. Besant) to establish a tribunal \"to invest igate matters af fecting th e good na me of the Soci ety, and the conduct of certa in members\"; this was lost by \"an overwhel ming majorit y.\" Another resolut ion regre tted that \"the Administration, the Magazine, and the influence of the Socie ty have been used for controversi al politi cal ends and sectari an rel igious propagand a.\" Unhappil y these resolut ions were not m et in th e fratern al spiri t that might be expected from a Soci ety setting out to establ ish U niversal Brotherhood and were stigmatized in a proposed am endment as \"de structive motions ... at vari ance with the objects for which th e Societ y stands.\" This clause in the amendment was lost b y a small majorit y, but a very large majori ty supported the further clauses in which the Speci al Convent ion af firmed \"its complete confid ence in the administr ation of the Socie ty and i ts"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"belov ed and rever ed President Dr. Annie Besant, the chosen leader of w hom it is justl y proud,\" and sent \"its cordia l gree tings to Bishop L eadbea ter, F.T.S.,\" thanking him \"for his inva luable work and his uns werving devotion to the cause of Theosoph y and the servic e of the Theosophi cal Societ y.\" There are, then, a cer tain num ber of Theosophists in this countr y who have the courag e and public spiri t to prot est against the use of the Societ y for polit ical ends and aga inst infractions of th e moral code which they believe certa in members to have committed. But this party unfortuna tely constitut es onl y a small minority; the rest are prepar ed to render blind and unquestion ing obedien ce to the dic tates of M rs. Besant and Mr . Leadb eater. In this respect the Theosophica l Socie ty follows the usual plan of secre t socie ties. For although not nom inally a secre t societ y it is one in ef fect, being composed of outer and inner circles and absolut ely contro lled by suprem e dire ctors. The inner circ le, known as the Esoteri c Section, or rather the East ern School of Theosoph y--usually referred to as the E.S.--is in reali ty a secre t socie ty, consisting in its turn of three further cir cles, the inner most co mposed of the Mahat mas or Masters of the White Lodge, the second of the Accep ted Pupils or Ini tiates, and the third of the Learn ers or ordinar y members. The E.S. and Co-M asonr y thus co mpose two secret socie ties with in the open order contro lled by peopl e who are frequen tly members of both. Whether even these high er ini tiates are really in the secre t is another question. Dr. Weller van Hook who is said to have been also a Rosicrucian and an i mpor tant member of the Grand Orient once cr yptically observed that \"Theosoph y is not the hier archy,\" implying that it was onl y part of a world- organiz ation, and darkl y hinting that if it did not carr y out the work al lotted to it, the Rosicruc ians would take control. That th is is mo re than probable we s hall see l ater. The outer ranks of the Theosophica l Societ y seem to be lar gely composed of harm less enthusi asts w ho imagine that they are receiving genuin e instruc tion in the rel igions and occult doc trines of the East. That the teach ing of the E.S. w ould not be tak en seriousl y by any real Orient alist and tha t they could le arn far m ore by studying the works of recogn ized authorit ies on these subjects at a Universit y or at the British Museum does not occur to the m for a m oment. Nor would this fulfil the purpose of the leaders. For the Theosophi cal Society is not a stud y group, but essenti ally a propagandist societ y which aims at substitu ting for th e pure and simp le teaching of Christian ity the amazing compound of Eastern supersti tion, Cabalis m, and eight eenth- centur y charla tanism which Mrs. Besant and her coadjutors have devised. Yet even were the doctrines of Mrs. Besant those of true Buddhis m or of Brah manism, to what ext ent are they likely to benefi t Western civ ilization? Sett ing the question of Christ ianity aside, experienc e sho ws tha t the attempt to ori entalize Occident als m ay prove no less disastrous than the attempt to occidenta lize Orienta ls, and tha t to tr ansport Eastern mysticism to th e West is to vulgari ze it and to produce a debased form of occul tism that frequen tly ends in mo ral deterior ation or mental derange ment. 721 I attr ibute the scandals that have taken place amongst Theosophists dir ectly to this cause. But it is ti me to turn to another socie ty in which this debased occult ism plays a still more impor tant part."},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"R OSICRUCIANISM At the present t ime, as in the e ighteen th cen tury, the term \"Rosicrucianism\" is used to cover a number of as sociations dif fering in th eir ai ms and doctr ines. The first of these societies to be founded in England was the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia , founded in 1867 b y Robert Wentworth L ittle on instruc tions rec eived from abroad. Only Master Mason s are admitted--a procedure not conde mned by Grand Lodge of Engl and, which regards the S.R.I.A. as a perfect ly innocuous bod y. Although nei ther polical nor anti- Christian, but, on the contrar y, contain ing distinc tly Christian elements and claiming to descend fro m Christ ian Rosenkreut z--a cl aim which m ust be dism issed as an absurdi ty--the S.R.I.A. is neverth eless lar gely Cabal istic, 722 dealing with the forces of Nature, alche my, etc. If its progenitors are reall y to be tra ced furth er back than the Rosicruc ians of the ninete enth cen tury--Ragon, E liphas Lév i, and Kenneth Mackenz ie-- they must be sought a mongst cert ain esoter ic Masons in Hungar y and also amongst the French Martinistes, whose ritua ls doubtless derived from a kindred source. It will be remembered that Marlines Pasquall y bequea thed to his disciples a large nu mber of Jewish manuscr ipts which were presumably preserved in the archives of th e Martinist e Lodge at Lyons. The Order of Martinist es has never ceased to exist, and the Presiden t of the Suprê me Conseil, Dr . Gérard Encausse, well known as \"Papus,\" an avowed Caba list, only died in 1916. To these arch ives another famous Caba list, the renegade Abbé, Alphon se Louis Constant, who as sumed the name of E liphas Lév i, may well have had acc ess. It is said that one of Eliphas Lévi's mos t distingu ished discip les, the occult ist Baron Spedal ieri of Marseil les, was a me mber of the \"Grand Lodge of Solit ary Brethren of the Mounta in,\" an \"Illu mined Brother of the Ancient Restored Order of Manicheans,\" a high m ember of the Grand O rient, and also a \"High Illu minate of the Martinist es.\" Before his dea th in 1875 El iphas Lév i announced that in 1879 a new poli tical and religious \"universal Kingdo m\" would be establ ished, and tha t it would be pos sessed b y \"him who w ould have the keys of the East.\" The m anuscr ipt con taining this prophec y was passed on b y Baron Spedal ieri to Edward Mait land, who in his turn gave i t to a leading member of S.R.I. A., by whom it was published in Eng lish. 723 But, as w e have already seen, the principa l centre of Caba lism was in E astern Europe, whilst Germ any was the princ ipal hom e of Rosicruc ianism, and it was from these directions th at, a few y ears late r, a new Rosicruc ian Order in England der ived its inspira tion. It is curious to not ice that the eigh ties of the last cen tury were m arked b y a simultaneous recrud escence of secret societies and of Social ist or ganiz ations. In 1880 Leopo ld Enge l reor ganized Weishaupt's Order of Illu minati, which, ac cording to M.

On March 8, 1888, a warrant was then drawn up accord ing to the design given in th e cypher MSS. and was signed b y S.A. for S.D. A., by M.E.

It is int eresting to note that whilst the instruc tions in the c ypher MSS. were in Engl ish and Ger man, the na me now given to the new Order \"The Golden Dawn,\" was acco mpanied by its equiv alent in Hebrew \"Chebre th Zerech aur Bokher\" that is to sa y \"The Comp anions of the Rising Ligh t of the Morning.\" Amongst the instruct ions we find: \"A void Ro man Cathol ics but with pit y\"; also these directions conc erning the Obliga tion: The candida te asking for Light is taken to the Altar and forced to take an Obligation to secrec y under pena lty of expulsion and dea th or pals y from hostile current of wil l.

Mathers in fact tr anslated the fa mous book of Abraha m the Jew from French into Engl ish with expl anator y notes, and Wynn Westco tt translated the Sepher Yetzirah fro m Hebrew . Lectur es were given to the socie ty on such sub jects as the Tarot Cards, Geo mantic Talismans, and the Sche mhamphorasch or Tetragr ammaton. The Order was at first absolut ely governed by the thr ee Chiefs, but after a time--owing to the death of Woodm an and the resignation of Wynn Westcot t--Mathers bec ame the Sole Chief and professed to have obtained further instructions fro m the Hidden Chiefs through his wife- -a sister of Ber gson--b y means of cl airvo yance and c lairaud ience. But the real directors of the Order were in Ger many and known a s the \"Hidden and Secret Chiefs of the Third Order .\" A curious rese mblance will here be noted with the \"Conceal ed Superiors\" b y whom members of the Stricte Observance in the eighte enth cen tury declared themselv es to be contro lled. Who th ese m en were at the time the Order was founded re mains a mystery not onl y to the outside world but even to the English ini tiates the mselves. The identi ty of Sapiens Dominabatur Astris appears never to have been established, nor wa s anything m ore heard about the sti ll more mysterious Anna Sprengel until her death in an obscure Ger man village was report ed in 1893. Indeed, one of the most active members of th e Order , Dr. Robert Felkin, M.D., known a s F.R. (Finem Respic e), lat er dec lared that, a lthough he had visited five temples of the Order in Germ any and Austria, he had been unabl e to get into touch with the Hidden Chiefs, or to discover how the orig inal MSS. ca me into the hands of the clergyman who handed the m to Wynn Westcott and Woodman. According to Felkin's stat ement, all that he had been able to find out was that the MSS. were the notes of cer emonies made by a man who had been initiated into a Lodge in Germ any, and that the temple fro m which they originat ed was \"a special temple\" working on th e Cabal a tree like the English branch of the Order. Further , he was told that none of the \"big Three\" who founded the Golden Dawn in England were real Rosicrucians at all. The confusion of ideas which must inev itably result when, as in secret socie ties or revolu tionar y organiza tions, a nu mber of people are being blindl y led b y hidden direc tors, natur ally brought about dissensions a mongst the m embers, who mu tually accused each other of ignorance of the real ai ms of the Order. Thus the London Lodge ended by break ing with Mathers, who was in Paris, on accoun t of his arrogan ce in claiming supre me power through the mystery of the Hidden Chiefs, and after two y ears of unsett led govern ment, in 1902 ele cted three new chi efs--Dr . Felkin (F.R. = Fine m Respic e), Bullock, a solic itor (L.O. = Levav i Oculos) who resigned at the end of the y ear, and Brodie Innes (S.S.--S ub Spe). But although Mathers had been repud iated, his teachings were retained as em anating from the Hidden Chiefs. Two years earl ier a dram atic inc ident had occurred. In a ver y sinister personage, Aleister Crowle y, had been in troduced into the Order on the reco mmendation of A. E. Waite (S.R. = Sacra mentum Regis) the well-known m ystical write r. A man of m any aliases, Cro wley followed the prec edent of the \"Co mte de Saint-Ger main,\" the \"Com te de Cagliostro,\" and the \"Baron von Of fenbach\" b y ennobl ing hi mself and m asquer ading under various ti tles"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"in turn, such as \"Count Svaref f,\" \"Lord Boleskine,\" \"Baron Rosenkreu tz,\" but usually known in the Order as \" P\" for \"Perdurabo.\" Crowle y, who was a Caba list, had written a book on G oetic Magic and soon after becoming a member of the \"Golden Dawn\" set to work with another \"Frater\" on m agical exper iments, including evoca tions, the consecration and use of ta lismans, divin ation, alchemy, etc. In 1900 Cro wley had joined Mathers in Paris w here the latter and his wife were l iving under the assum ed na mes of the \"Com te and Com tesse of Glenstrae\" and engag ed in reviv ing the mysteries of I sis at the Bodinière Theatre. In this task th ey were joined b y an extraordinar y lady, the notorious Madam e Horos (alias the Swam i) who claimed to be the rea l and auth entic Sapiens Dom inabatur Astris. Crowley described her as \"a ver y stout wom an and very fair\" and \"a vam pire of re mark able power;\" Mathers declared her to be \"probab ly the most powerful m edium living,\" but later, in a letter to anoth er member of the \"Golden Dawn\" ob served : \"I bel ieve her and her ac complices to be emissaries of a very powerfu l secret occu lt order who have been tr ying for y ears to break up other Orders and especi ally my work.\" Inciden tally this lad y, who proved to be a false S.D.A., ended b y starting an Order in collabor ation with her husband, in which it was said tha t cert ain ri tuals of the Golden Dawn were adapt ed to an immoral purpose, with the result that the coupl e were brought to tria l and fin ally conde mned to penal servitud e. Whether owing to this disturbing experienc e, or because, as Cro wley declared, he had \"imprud ently attracted to hi mself forces of evi l too great and terribl e for hi m to withstand, presum ably Abram elin demons,\" Mathers' reason began to to tter. This then was the situ ation at the time of his rupture with the Order, and the dram atic inc ident referr ed to was the sudden appe arance of Crowle y in London, who, w hether act ing as Mathers' envo y or on his own ini tiative, broke into th e premises of the Order , with a black mask over his face, a plaid shawl thrown over his s houlders, an enorm ous gold (or gilt) cross on his breast, and a dagger at his side, for the purpo se of taking over posses sion. This attempt was baf fled with the prosaic aid of the poli ce and Crowley was expelled from the Order. Eventu ally, however , he succeeded in obtain ing pos session of some of the ritu als and other docum ents of the Golden Dawn, which he proceeded to publish in the organ of a new O rder of his o wn. This m agazin e, conta ining a mixture of debased Cabalis m and vulgar blasphe mies, interspersed with paneg yrics on haschish--for Crowle y combined with sexual perversion an addi ction to drugs--w hich might appear to express onl y the ravings of a maniac. But ec centri city has often provided the best cloak for dark designs, and the outbre ak of war proved tha t ther e was a me thod in the madness of the man who m the authori ties persisted in regard ing m erely as an irrespon sible degen erate of a non-poli tical kind. To quote the press report of his exploits after th is date: In Nove mber 1914 Cro wley went to the United States, where he entered into close relations with the pro-Ger man propagandists. He edi ted th e New York Internationa l , a German propagandist paper run b y the notorious Geor ge Silvester Viereck, and published, among oth er things, an obscene attack on th e King and a glorific ation of the Kaiser .

During his sta y in Americ a Crowle y was associat ed with a bod y known a s the \"Secret Revolut ionar y Committee\" which was working for the estab lishm ent of an Irish Republ ic. He is known also as the writer of a defeatest manifesto c ircula ted in France in 1915. But to return to the Golden Dawn. In 1903 a split occurred in the Order . A.E. Waite, an early member of it, seceded from it with a nu mber of other m embers and carr ied off with him the name of \"Golden Dawn,\" also th e vault and other propert y of the Order . The origin al Order th en took the name of \"Stell a Matutin a,\" with Dr. Felkin as Chief. In the preceding year the members of the London Lodge had again be lieved that they were in touch with the Hidden Third Order and revived their efforts to co mmunicate with the Secret Chiefs in Ger many. This state of uncerta inty continued till about 1910, w hen Felkin and Meakin set forth for Ger many, where the y succeeded in m eeting severa l members of the Third Order , who profes sed to be \"true and genuine Rosicruci ans\" and to know of Anna Sprengel and the starting of the Order in Eng land. They were not, it was believed, the Secre t and Hidden Chiefs, but m ore probabl y Esoter ic Masons of the Grand Orient. These Fratres, however , told the m that in order to for m a definit e etheric link betwe en the mselves and the Order in Great Britain, it would be necessar y for a Bri tish Frater to be under their instruction for a y ear. According ly Meakin remained in Germany for speci al tra ining, so that he m ight ac t as the \"etheri c link\" between the two countr ies. After a pilgri mage to the Near East, close ly following the itinerar y of Christian Rosenkreut z, Meakin returned to Germ any, and it appe ars to have been now that he wa s able to ge t into touch with a certa in high adept of occu lt science. This remarkabl e personage, Rudolf Steine r, had ear lier belonged to the Theosophi cal Socie ty, and it has been suggested that at so me period he m ay have been connec ted with the revived Illuminati of Leopold Engel. There is cer tainly some reason to beli eve tha t at one point in his career he ca me into touch with m en who were carr ying on the te achings of Weishaupt, the chief of whom was the President of a group of Pan-Germ an secre t socie ties, and it see ms not improbab le tha t the mysterious S.D. A., under whose dire ctions the Golden Dawn wa s founded, might be locat ed in this circ le. A few y ears before the war, Steiner , whilst stil l a Theosophist, started a society of his own, the Anthroposophical Societ y, a name borrowed from the work of th e XV IIth century Rosicruci an, Thomas Vaughan, \"Anthroposophica Magica.\" The ostensible leader of Rosicruc ianism in Germ any was Dr . Franz Hart mann, founder of the \"Order of the Esoter ic Rose Croix.\" Although in some way connec ted with Engel's Illu minati and m ore defin itely with th e Theosophica l Socie ty, Hart mann was believ ed to be a genuine Christi an mystic. Stein er also m ade the same profession, and i t seems probabl e that he formed one of the group of m ysterious personages, inc luding besides G rand Orient Masons, Baron von K nigge, great grandson of Weishaup t's coadjutor \"Philo,\" who me t together in secret conference at Ingoldstad t where th e first Lodge of the Illuminati had been founded in 1776, and decided to revive Illuminism on Christian m ystic lines used in a very elasti c sense a mongst occult ists. At the same time Steiner in troduces into his"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"teaching a strong vein of G nostic ism, Luc iferian ism, Johannism , and Grand Orient Masonr y, whilst reserving Rosicrucian ism for his higher initiates. O n this last point he is extremely reticent, preferring to cal l his tea ching \"occult science,\" since he recogn izes that \"rea l Rosicruci ans never procl aim themselv es as s uch\"; it is therefore only in th e inner circle of his socie ty, on which no inform ation is given to the public and into which members are admitted by much the same forms of ini tiation as those used b y the Grand Orient, that Rosicrucian ism is mentioned. Some of Steiner's i mitators in The Rosicrucian Fellowship at Oceanside, Californ ia, however , openl y profess what the y call Rosicruc ianism and at the sa me time claim superior knowledg e on the subject of Masonr y. Thus in a book b y the leader of this group we find it sole mnly stated that according to Max Heindl, Eve cohabit ed with serpen ts in the garden of Eden, that Cain was the of fspring of her union with \"the Lucifer Spirit Sam ael,\" and tha t from this \"divine progeni tor\" the most virile port ion of the hum an race descended, the rest be ing m erely the \"progen y of hum an parents.\" Readers of the present work will recogn ize this as not the legend of Masonr y but of the Jewish Caba la which has been already quoted in this context. 724 Whether this also for ms part of Steiner's tea ching i t is impossibl e to sa y, since his rea l doctr ines are known onl y to his inner cir cle; even some of his adm irers am ongst the Steiner Matutina, whilst consult ing hi m as an oracl e, are not ad mitted to the secrets of his grades of in itiation and have been unable to succeed in obta ining fro m him a charte r. Meanwhil e they themselv es do not disclose to the neoph ytes whom they seek to win over that they are m embers of an y secre t associat ion. This is quit e in accordanc e with the methods of Weishaup t's \"Insinua ting Brothers.\" The result of what Steiner calls \"occu lt science\" is thus de scribed in a striking passage of one of his o wn works: \"This is the change which the occult student observes co ming over hi mself--tha t ther e is no longer a connec tion between a thought and a feeling or a feel ing and a volit ion, excep t when he cre ates th e connec tion hi mself. No i mpulse drives hi m from thought to ac tion if he does not voluntar ily harbour it. He can now stand completely without fee ling before an object which, before his training, would have fil led him with glowing love or vio lent hatred; he can lik ewise re main actionless before a thought which heretofor e would have spurred hi m to ac tion as if by itself,\" etc. I can imagine no cl earer exposé of the dangers of occult ism than this. Weishaup t had said : \"I canno t use m en as I find the m; I must for m them.\" Dr. Steiner shows ho w this transfor mation can be acco mplished. Under the influenc e of so-call ed occu lt training, which is in real ity simply powerful suggestion, all a man's native impulses and inhibit ive springs of act ion m ay be broken; the pupil of the occu ltist will no longer reac t to the conceptions of beau ty or uglin ess, of righ t or wrong, w hich, unknown to hi mself, form ed the law of his being. Thus not only his conscious deeds but his s ub-conscious proces ses pass under the control of another . If this is inde ed the method employed by Dr. Steiner and his adepts there would certa inly seem to be some justification for the verdict of M. Robert Kuentz tha t \"Stein er has devised occult exercises which render the mind in capabl e (renden t l'esprit anéant i), tha t he at tacks the individu al by deranging his facu lties (il détraque les facult és).\" 725"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"What is the real m otive power behind such societ ies as the Stella Matutin a and aga in behind Steiner? This re mains a m ystery, not onl y to the outsid e world but to the \"initiates\" the mselves. The quest of the Hidden Chiefs, undertaken by one intr epid pilgrim after ano ther, seems to have ended only in further m eetings with Steine r. Yet hope springs etern al in the breast of the aspiran t after occul t knowledge, and astral messages spurred the Fratres to further efforts. One of these con tained the exhor tation : \"Go on with Stein er, which is not the ultimate end of search, and we will co me into contac t with m any serious students who will lead us to the rea l master of the Order , who will be so overpowering ly impressive as to le ave no roo m for doubt.\" A curious analog y with Co-Ma sonry will here be ob served. For w hilst the veiled picture of the Co-Ma sonic lodges is said to represent \"the Master\" in the person of Ragocsk y or some other personage in Austria or H ungar y, so it is likewise in Austria and Germ any that the members of Stella Matutin a seek the ir Hidden Chi efs and the \"real Master\" of their Order . Moreover , whilst the Co-Ma sons await the coming of th e great \"World Teacher ,\" King, or Messiah in 1926, i t is also in 1926 that the Stel la Matu tina expect Christian Rosenkreut z to appe ar again. 726 There are m any other points of resem blance be tween the phraseolog y of the two Orders, as, for exa mple, the idea of the \"Astral Light,\" \"the Great White Lodge,\" and also \"th e GRE AT WORK\" b y which both Orders denote the supre me object of their aspira tions--\"the union of the East and the West.\" It is ther efore i mpossibl e not to su spect that, although the members of Co-Masonr y and of the Stell a Matutin a imagine their respectiv e Orders to be ent irely unconnect ed and inde ed appear to be hard ly aware of each oth er's exist ence, there may be never theless some point of junction in the background and even a com mon centre of direct ion. In this connexion i t is int eresting to notic e the polit ical tendenc ies of the societies in question. Although the outco me of the Maçonnerie Mixte , and no minally under the jurisdiction of headquar ters in Paris, Co-Masonr y does not appear to be pro-French in its sympathies. On the contr ary, the Co-m asonic lodges in th is countr y, as also the head lodge in the Rue Jules-Breton, seem to have adopted that form of universal brotherhood which principa lly redounds to the benef it of Ger many. The Stell a Matutin a, whilst profe ssing to be solel y concerned in occul t scienc e and warning its me mbers against Co-M asonr y on accoun t of the polit ical tenden cies of the latter, is neverth eless still more imbued with Germ an influ ence, since, as we have seen, it has ever since it first ca me into existen ce been secretl y under Ger many direct ion. Indeed, during the war this inf luence beca me so apparent that certa in patr iotic members, who had entered the societ y in all good faith with the idea of stud ying occul t scienc e, raised an energetic protest and a schism took pl ace. Thus, ju st as in the case of Co-Masonr y, the more clear -sighted recogni zed th e impruden ce of pl acing themselv es under foreign contro l.

But it is time to"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"pass on to the question of y et another secret associa tion, for am ongst those present at the Conferen ce referr ed to were members of the group Clart é. This society, of w hich the na me as well as its avowed ai ms are singular ly reminiscent of Illuminism, was first heard of in France and was led by men who carried on act ive ant i- patriotic propaganda throughout the war . Amongst these was Henri Barbusse, author of Le Feu , a defea test novel which was receiv ed with ac clamations from \"illuminated\" reviewers in the press of this countr y. Yet although outwardl y a French or ganiz ation, the real inspira tion and teach ing of Clarté is essentially German- Jewish and a great numb er of Jews are to be found am ongst its members, part icularly in Central Europe. At the inaugur al meeting of the Austrian group it was stated tha t 80 per cen t. of those present were of th e Jewish race. The keynote of Clarté is Intern ationalism--abolit ion of nationality, destruction of frontiers, and pacifis m or rather the substitut ion of cl ass warfare for war between nat ions. For this purpose it is willing to m ake use of all subversive doc trines, to whatever school of thought the y may belong. Hence, a lthough the creed of the le aders is professedl y Socia lism, they readi ly co-opera te with Syndicalists, Anarch ists, or revolut ionaries of an y brand, carr ying on propaganda in Trade Unions and various workers' or ganizat ions; som e are secret ly in th e ranks of the Communists. In fact members of Charté have succeeded in penetr ating into a lmost ever y subversive group, even as far afie ld as New Zeal and, where the societ y has an agenc y in Wellington and disseminates the m ost violent revolut ionar y teaching and li teratur e. But whilst thus m aking use of the \"prole tariat\" to further i ts ends, the point of view of Clarté is fundam entally undem ocratic--for the rea l griev ances of the worker s it has no use at all. The plan of this group--who were recent ly described in the French press as \"the finest speci mens of canniba ls sme ared with hum anitarian ism (les plus beaux spéci mens de cannibal es barbouil lés d'hum anitairerie)\"--is to constitut e a sort of Int ernation al Hierar chy of Intel lectual Socialists, whose influ ence is to m ake itself invisibl y felt in literary, educa tional, and art istic circl es all over the world. For the members of Clarté are as carefu l as were the adepts of Weishaupt to preserve th eir incogn ito and not to be known as \"Illu minati.\" Thus the publ ic in our o wn countr y and elsewhere, reading the diatribes of cer tain well-known authors aga inst the existing order of societ y, may vaguel y wonder wh y men living a midst al l the amenities of civil ization should desire its destruc tion, but do not drea m that all this is not th e outco me of an ind ividua l brain but propagand a put out by a compan y which, having largely prim ed such writ ers with ideas, is abl e, owing to th e high posit ion of m any of its lead ing m embers and its influence with the literary world, to ensure the success of an y publ ication tha t will further i ts ends.

It is interesting, by the wa y, to notice that the ar t of m ovement known as Eurh ythmy--not to be confounded with the system of M. Dalcroze which is known in Engl and onl y as Eurhythmics--forms an im portant part of the curriculu m of the last socie ty, as also of Herr Stein er's Order , of the Stel la Matut ina, and of the Russian Bolsheviks. 728 The one question that presents itself to the judicial mind after examining a ll these movements, is in evitab ly: Are the y of an y real importan ce? Can a few hundreds, or even thousands, of m en and wom en, drawn lar gely by curiosi ty or want of occup ation into socie ties of which the ver y names are hard ly known to the general public, exercise any influence on the world at large? It would cert ainly be an error to overesti mate the power that each of these socie ties individua lly can wield; to do so would be, in fac t, to play into the hands of the le aders, who se plan, fro m Weishaupt onward s, has alwa ys been to represen t themselves as direc ting the destin ies of the universe. This cla im to power is the bait laid for neoph ytes, who are made to beli eve tha t \"the Order will one day rule the world.\" But, whilst recogni zing the folly of this pretension, we s hould be m istaken in underra ting th eir importanc e, for the reason that they provide eviden ce of a larger organiz ation in the background. The Stella Matutin a may be onl y an obscure Fraternity, even the Theosophic al Society with all its ra mifications 729 may not be of great importance in itself, but will anyone with a knowledg e of European affairs seriousl y maintain tha t the Grand Orient is a s mall or uni mport ant organization? And have we not seen tha t invest igations into th e smaller secret societ ies frequent ly lead back to this grea ter masoni c power ? Secre t societ ies are of im portan ce, bec ause the y are, m oreove r, symptomatic, and also because, al though the work ac tually carried out in their lodges or counc ils may be of a triv ial charac ter, they are able b y the power of associat ion and the collective force the y generat e to inf luence public opinion and to float ideas in the outside world which may have far-reaching consequen ces. At an y rate, the fact that they exist final ly disposes of the cont ention that secret socie ties of a subversive and even of an abom inable kind are things of the past. These amazing cults, these strange perverted rites which we as sociate with the dark ages, are going on around us to-day. Illuminism, Cabalis m, and even Satanism are still realities. In 1908 Monsieur Copin Albance lli stated that c ircumstan ces had af forded him the proof that- - certain Masonic societ ies exist which are Satan ic, not in the sense that th e devil comes to preside at the ir meetings, as tha t romancer of a Leo Taxil pretended, but in that th eir"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"initiates profess the cul t of Luc ifer.

Yet since al l these movements are intimately connect ed with revo lutionar y agitation they are well worth th e attention of Govern ments that desire to protect law, order , and public morality. The fact is that the very extravagan ce of the ir doctr ines and prac tices seems to ensure the ir immunity. Neverth eless, whether th e power at work behind them is of the kind we are accusto med to call \"supernatur al,\" or w hether it is me rely the out come of the hu man mind, th ere can be no doubt of its potenc y for evil and of its ver y definit e effects in the obliter ation of all sense of truth and in sexual perversion. In the opinion of an init iate who belonged for y ears to the Stella Matutina, the dynamic force employed known as \" Kundal ini\" is si mply an el ectro- magnetic force, of which the sex-force is a part, on w hich the adep ts know ho w to play, and \"the unseen hand behind all the seem ing Spiritism of these Orders is a s ystem of ver y subtle and cunning hypnotism and suggestion.\" Further , the aim of th is group like that of all subversive Esoter ic Orders, is, b y means of such processes as eurh ythmics, m editations, s ymbols, ceremonies, and form ulas, to awaken this force and produce false \"Illu mination\" for the purpose of obta ining \"Spiri tual Seership,\" which is at most clairvo yance, cla iraudi ence, etc. The cer emoni es of the Order are hypnotic, and b y suggestion crea te the necessar y mental and astral atmosphere, hypnotize and prepar e the members to be the willing tools in the hands of the controll ing adep ts.

We are convinced that the Order is being controll ed by some SUN O rder af ter the nature of the Illuminati, if not by that Order itself. The reason wh y they (the leaders of all such Orders) insisted so much upon the Church and Sacram ent, especia lly before the initiation, is, I think, for the sa me reason as the use of the consecrat ed Ho st in Black Magic.

O PEN S UBVERS IVE M OVE MEN TS Although the scept ical reader who has reach ed this stage of the present work will perhaps be willing to adm it that som e connex ion m ay be trac ed between hidden forces and open subversive m ovements, the objection he will still raise aga inst the general thesis here set forth will probabl y be expressed som ewhat in the following m anner:"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"\"It is quite possible that secret socie ties and other unseen agencies may have played a part in revolutions, but to at tribut e the continued revolt against the exist ing social order to these causes is absurd. Povert y, unemployment, inadequ ate housing, and above all th e inequ alities of hu man life are qui te suf ficien t to produce a revolu tionar y spirit without the aid of secret instigators. Social revo lution is sim ply a rising of the 'have- nots' against the 'haves,' and requires no further cause to expla in it.\" Let it be at once ad mitted that the injustic es here enu merated are rea l. The working classes throughou t the ninete enth cen tury had ver y genuine reason s for co mplaints. Wages were far too low, the rich som etimes showed the mselves indif feren t to the sufferings of the poor , employers of labour often made profits out of al l proportion to the remuneration paid to the workers. Nor , in spite of the i mmense reforms introduc ed during the last hundred years, have al l these grievanc es been redressed. The slums of our great cities sti ll const itute a blot upon our civi lization. Profiteering since the beginning of the war has been more flagr ant than ever. \"Rings\" and co mbines provide fabulous wealth for indiv iduals or group s at the expense of vast nu mbers of consu mers. And in all classes of the community, just as before th e French Revolu tion, people feast and dance whilst others live on the border -line of starvation. But let us see how far the Social ist movement can be regard ed as the spontan eous revolt of the \"people\" against this condit ion of things. Divid ing the people after the manner of Marx into the non-revo lutionar y and the \"revolut ionar y prole tariat,\" we shall find tha t the former categor y, by far the larger, combines with a strong respect for tradi tion a perfect ly reasonab le desire for s ocial reform . Brief ly it asks for adequ ate wages, decent housing, and a fair share of the good things of l ife. For Stat e interf erence in the affairs of ever yday life it feels noth ing but abhorren ce. The ideal of Com munism as form ulated by Lenin, wherein \"the get ting of food and cloth ing shall be no longer a private affair,\" 731 would meet with stronger opposition from working m en--and still more fro m working women, to whom \"shopping\" is as the breath of life- -than fro m any other section of th e popula tion. Even such apparen tly benign Social ist sche mes as \"com munal dining- rooms\" or \"co mmunal kitchens\" appeal less to the working- class me ntality than to the upper -class mind that devises the m. Turning to the \"revolution ary prolet ariat,\" we shall find this indiv idualistic instinc t quite as strongl y developed. It is not the Social ist idea of plac ing al l wealth and propert y in the hands of the State, but the Anarchist plan of \"expropria tion,\" of plunder on a gig antic scale for the benefit of the revolu tionar y masses, w hich really appea ls to the disgruntled portion of the proletar iat. The Social ist int ellectua l may write of the beaut ies of nationalization, of the joy of working for the common good without hope of personal gain; the revolut inary working m an sees nothing to attra ct him in all this. Question him on his ide as of s ocial transform ation, and he will gener ally express hims elf in favour of some method b y which he will acquire something he has not got; he does not want to see the rich m an's motor-car social ized by the Sta te--he wants to drive about in it himself. The revolut ionar y working m an is thus in rea lity not a Socia list but an Anarch ist at heart. Nor in som e cases is this unnatura l. That the m an who en joys none of the good things of life should wish to snatch his s hare must at least appear co mprehensibl e. What is not"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"comprehensible is that he should wish to renounce all hope of ever possessing anything. Modern Socia list propagand ists are ver y well aware of this att itude of the working c lasses towards the ir sche mes, and therefore that as long as the y explain the rea l progra mme they mean to put into opera tion, which is nothing but the workhouse s ystem on a giganti c scale, the y can m eet with no success. As a life-long Socialist has frequentl y observed to me, \"Social ism has never been a working-cl ass movement; it was alwa ys we of the middle or upper classes who s ought to instil the prin ciples of Socialism into the m inds of working m en.\" Mr. Hyndman's candid confessions of the failures to enlist the s ympathies even of slum -dwellers in his schem es of socia l regener ation bear out this testi mony. Less honest Soci alist orators as the resul t of long exper ience have th erefore adopted the more effectual pol icy of appe aling to the predator y instincts of the crowd. From Babeuf onwards, Social ism has onl y been able to m ake headwa y by borrowing the language of Anarch y in order to blast its wa y to power. Socia lism is thus e ssent ially a system of dec eption devised b y middle- class theorists and in no sen se a popular cre ed. Had the revolution ary movement of the past 150 y ears reall y proce eded fro m the peopl e, it would inevit ably have followed the lin e laid down b y one of the two sections of the prolet ariat indic ated above, tha t is to say, it would ei ther have taken the form of a cont inuous and incre asing agi tation for social reform s which would have enlisted the sympathy of al l right- thinking men and must therefore in the end have proved irresistibl e, or it would have followed the line of Anarch y, organiz ing brigandag e on a larger and y et larger scale, unt il, all owners of wealth having been exter minated and their expropri ators in the ir turn exter minated by their fellows, the world would have been reduc ed to a depopulat ed desert. But the world revolu tion has fol lowed neith er of these lines. Always the opponent of sane socia l refor ms which Socialists deride as \" melioration\" or as fut ile attempts to shore up an obsolete system, it has consisten tly disassocia ted itself fro m such men as Lord Shaftesbur y, who did more to better the condi tions of the working classes than anyone who has ever l ived. Anarch y, on the other hand, has been used b y them merely as a m eans to an end; for genu ine revolu tionar y senti ment they have no use at all. In Ru ssia the Anarchists bec ame the first objects of Soviet venge ance. The cynical attitude of Socia lists towards the revolut ionar y prole tariat was illustr ated by Mr. Bernard Shaw , who in Dece mber 1919 openl y boasted tha t he had helped to or ganize the ra ilway strike, 732 and two y ears later wrote about th e miners' strike in the following t erms: A Socia list State would not toler ate such an atta ck on the community as a strike for a moment. If a Trade Union at tempted such a th ing, the old Capit alist law against Trade Unions as conspiraci es would be re-ena cted within twent y-four hours and put ruthl essly into execu tion. Such a monstrosi ty as the recent coal strike, during which the coa l-miners spent all th eir savings in damaging their neighbours and wrecking the nat ional industries, would be impossible under Socialism. It was m iserab ly defea ted, as it deserved to be. 733 Now, if this had been writt en by the Duke of N orthu mberland in the National Review instead of b y Mr. Bernard Shaw in the Labour Monthly , one can imagine the outcr y there"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"would have been in the Socia list press. But the leaders of w hat is cal led de mocracy may always use what language they please in speaking of the peop le. \"Our peasants,\" Maxi m Gork y openl y declared, \"are bruta l and debased, hardl y hum an. I hate them.\" 734 It will be noticed th at in descriptions of the French Revolu tion references to the savager ies of the peopl e are never resented by the L iberal or Social ist press; the person s of the leaders alone are sacred. It is cl early not the cause of de mocr acy but of dem agogy that these champions of \"lib erty\" are out to defend. The world-revolut ion is therefor e not a popular m ovement but a conspira cy to impose on the people a system directly oppo sed to their real demands and aspira tions, a system which, moreover , has proved disastrous ever y time an attempt has been made to put i t into pract ice. Russia has provided a further exam ple of its futi lity. The fac t that the more responsible leaders in th is countr y do not advocate violen ce, does not affect the ult imate issue. Whilst Bolshevis m sets out to destro y Capita lism at a blow , Socialism prefers a m ore gradual process. It is th e differenc e between clubbing a man on the head and bleed ing hi m to death--tha t is all. The fact is that all Soci alism leads to Com munism in the long run 735 and therefore to disaste r. The Bolshevist régi me brought ruin and m isery to Rus sia not bec ause of the bruta lity of its m ethods, but because it was founded on the gigant ic econo mic falla cy that industr y can be carr ied on withou t priva te ent erprise and personal ini tiative. The same theor y appli ed by constitu tional methods w ould produce prec isely the same resul ts. If the Socia lists are ever al lowed to carr y out the ir full program me, England may be reduced to the state of Ru ssia without the shedding of a drop of blood. But how are we to expla in the fact that in spite of th e failur e of Socia lism in the past, in spite of the gig antic fiasco present ed by Russia, in spit e, moreove r, of the declara tion by the Bolsheviks the mselves tha t Communism had fai led and mus t be repl aced by \"a new econo mic polic y,\" that is to sa y by a return to \"Capi talism,\" 736 there should stil l be a large and increasing body of people to proclai m the efficacy of Social ism as the remedy for all socia l ills?

Who, then, stands to gain b y advoca ting it? And further , who provides the vast sums spent on propaganda? If in rea lity Social ism is a rising of the \"have- nots\" against the \"haves,\" how is it tha t most of the m oney seems to be on the side of the \"have-nots\"? For whilst or ganizations working for law and order are hampered at every turn for funds, no finan cial considera tions ever seem to in terfere with the activ ities of the so-cal led \"Labour movement.\" Socia lism, in fact, appears to be a thoroughl y \"paying conc ern,\" into which a y oung m an enters as he might go into the City, with the reasonable expectation of \"doing well.\" It is onl y necessar y to glance at the histor y of the past hundred years to real ize that \"agita tion\" has provided a ple asant and remunerat ive career for hundreds of m iddle-class authors, j ournal ists, speakers, or ganizers, and dile ttantes of all kinds who would otherwise have been conde mned to pass their lives on of fice-stools or at schoolm asters' desks. And when we read the accounts of the del ightful treats provided for these \"devot ed workers\" in the cause of the proletar iat as given in the records of th e First Interna tionale or th e pages of Mrs. S nowden, we begin to understand the attractions of Socialism as a profession. 737 But again I repe at: Who provides th e funds for this vast campaign ? Do the y come out of the pockets of the workers or from some other mysterious reservoir of wealth? We shal l return to this point in a later chapt er. How is it possible at an y rate to believe in the sinceri ty of the exponents of equal ity who themselves adopt a style of living so different fro m that of the prole tariat whose cause they profes s to represent? If the doctr inaires of S ocialism form ed a band of ascet ics who had voluntari ly renounced luxur y and a musem ent in order to lead lives of povert y and self-sacrifice- -as countless rea lly devo ted m en and wom en not calling the mselves Socia lists have done--we should still doubt the soundness of their econo mic theor ies as applied to society in genera l, but we should respec t their disinter estedness. But with very few excep tions Socia list Intell ectua ls dine and sup, feast and a muse themselv es with as few scruples of consci ence as an y unregenera te Tories. With peopl e such as these i t is obviousl y as fut ile to reason, as it would be to at tempt to convin ce the agent of a quack medicine co mpany that the nostrums he pres ses on the publi c will not ef fect a cure. He is ver y well aware of that already. Hence the ef forts of well- meaning people to set forth in long, wel l-reasoned ar guments the \"falla cies of Socia lism\" produce li ttle or no result. All these so-called \"fallacies\" have been expo sed repeatedly by able writers and disproved by all exper ience, so that if based m erely on ignoran ce or error they would long since have ceased to obtain cred ence. The truth is that they are not falla cies but lies, del iberately devised and cir culated by men who do not believe in the m for a m oment and who can therefore only be described as unscrupulous charlatans exploit ing the creduli ty of the public. But if this descrip tion m ay be leg itimately applied to the bra ins behind Socia lism and to certain of its lead ing doctr inaires, there are doubtless thousands of honest visionar ies to be found in the m ovement. A system that profes ses to cure all the ills of lif e inevi tably appeals to generous minds that feel but do not reason.

The grea t triumph of Mus solini was to m ake the youth of Ital y realize that to be a Co mmunist was to be a \"back numb er,\" and that progre ss consisted in m arching forward to new ide as and aspira tions. The y oung m en of Cabet's sett lement discover ed this sixt y years ago when they form ed themselves into a band of \"Progressives\" in oppo sition to the old men who still clung to the obsolete doctrine of Com munism. Socia lism at the present m oment is in reali ty less a cre ed than a cult, founded not on practical exper ience but on unrea l theor y. It is here we find a connexion with secre t socie ties. M. Augustin Coch in in his bri lliant essa ys on the French Revolution 738 has describ ed that \"World of the Clouds\" of which the Grand Orient was the capital, peopled by the precursors of the French Revolution. \"Whilst in the real world the criterion of a ll thought lies in putting it to the t est,\" there in the World of the Clouds the criter ion is opinion. \"The y are there to talk, not to do; all this int ellectua l agitation, this i mmense traffic in speeches, writings, correspondenc e, leads not to the slightest beginning of w ork, of rea l effort.\" We should be wrong to judge the m harshl y; their theories on the perfe ctibility of hu man nature, on th e advant ages of savager y, which appear to us \"dangerous ch imeras,\" were never int ended to apply to real l ife, onl y to the World of the Clouds, where th ey present no danger but beco me, on th e contrar y, \"the most fecund truths.\" The revolut ionar y explosion might well have final ly shatt ered these illusions but for the Grand Orient. We have already seen the ident ity of theor y between French Masonr y and French Socialism in the ninete enth cen tury. It was thus tha t, although in France one exper iment after another demonstrat ed the unreali ty of Socia list Utopi as, the lodges were always there to reconstruct the m irage and lead hum anity on again acros s the burning desert sand s towards the same phanto m palm-trees and illusor y pools of water . Whatever the m anner in which these ideas penetrat ed to this countr y--whether through the Radica ls of the last centur y, adorers of the Encyclopædist Masons of F rance, or through the Brit ish discipl es of Germ an Socia l Democra ts from the time of the First Intern ationale onwards--it is impossible to ignore the rese mblance between the theor ies not only of French but of mod ern Brit ish Social ism and the doctrin es of illu minized Freemasonr y. Thus the ide a running through Freem asonr y of a Golden Age before the Fall, when ma n was free and happ y, and which through the applic ation of mason ic princ iples is to return once more, finds an exact counterpar t in the Socia list conc eption of a past halcyon era of Lib erty and Equali ty, which is to return not me rely in the form of a regen erated social order , but as a complete Mil lenniu m from which all th e ills of hum an life have been el iminated. This idea has always haunted th e imagination of Socia list writers from Rous seau to William Morris, and leads direct ly up to the further theor y--the necessity for destro ying civil ization."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"I canno t find in Mr. Lothrop Stoddart's conception of the revolution ary movement as the revol t of the \"Under Man\" against c ivilization, the origin of th is campaign.

To call Weishaup t, for exa mple, an \"Under Man\" would be absurd. But let us see what is the ide a on which the plan of de stroying civilization is ostensibl y founded. It will be remember ed tha t Rous seau like Weishaup t held that the Golden Age of felic ity did not end in the garden of Eden, as is popular ly suppo sed, but was prolonged into triba l and nom adic life.

No; when there is plent y of food the y all rejoice, feast, and m ake merry. 740 That when there is not plen ty of food the y occasiona lly eat each other is not me ntioned. Here, th en, is the theor y on which th is yearning for a return to nature is based.

The assump tion that under an idea l socia l order all human failings w ould vanish derives dir ectly from the two ma sonic doctrines which the Grand O rient, under the influ ence of Illu minism, has brought to a reductio ad absurdum --the perfe ctibility of hu man nature and universal brotherhood. The whole philosoph y of Socialism is built upon these false prem ises. Indeed the ac tual phraseolog y of illuminized Freem asonr y has now pas sed into the langu age of Socia lism; thus the old form ulæ of \"the United States of Europe\" and \"the Universal Republic\" have been adopted not onl y by Mrs. Besant and her followers 741 as the last word in m odern thought, but have also reappear ed as a bril liant inspira tion under the pen of Mr .

For the final goal of world-revolu tion is not Socialism or even Co mmunism, it is not a chang e in the existing econo mic system, it is not the destruct ion of civ ilization in a material sense; the revolu tion desired by the leaders is a m oral and spiritual revolut ion, an anarchy of ideas by which all standards set up throughout ninete en cen turies shall be reversed, all honoured tradi tions tra mpled under foot, and above all the Christ ian ide al finally obliter ated."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"It is true tha t a cer tain section of the Socia list m ovement procla ims itse lf Christian.

On examination i t will be found that their Christ is a being of their own inventing, that their Christi anity is a perversion of Christ' s real teaching. The Christ of Socia lism invoked in the inter ests of Pacifis m as the opponent of force and in the int erests of class warfare as a Social ist, a revolu tionar y, or even an \"agita tor,\" bears no rese mblance to the real Christ.

He did not tel l men to for give the ene mies of the ir countr y or of the ir religion, but only their privat e ene mies. Christ was not a Social ist when He declared that \"a ma n's life consisteth not in the abundance of the things that he posses seth.\" Social ism teaches that a man must never rest conten t as long as anoth er man posses ses tha t which he has not. Christ did not believ e in equali ty of pa yment when He told the parable of the ten talen ts and the unprofitab le servant. Social ism would reduce all labour to the pace of the slowest.

On the contrar y, Socialists are enjoined by their l eaders not to give th eir m oney away in char ity lest the y should help b y this means to prolong the exist ence of the present social system. The truth is that, as I showed in connex ion with the fallacy of represen ting Christ as an Essene, there is no evidence to sho w tha t He or His disciples practised even the purest for m of Co mmunism. Christ did not advoc ate any econo mic or poli tical system; He preached a spirit which if applied to any system would le ad to pea ce among m en. It is true that He enjoined His discip les to despise riches and tha t He denounced many of the rich men with whom He came into conta ct, but it must not be for gotten tha t His im mediate mission was to a race that had a lways glorified riches, tha t had worshipped th e golden calf, and by which wealth was regarded as the natura l reward of godlin ess. 742 Christ came to tea ch men not to look for present reward in the form of increased material welfare, but to do good out of love to God and one's neighbour .

In The Equino x--the Journal of Sci entific Illuminism , it is proposed that prostitutes should be placed on the sa me level as soldiers who have served the ir countr y and be honoured and pensioned by the State. 755 The community of wom en was not an idea th at orig inated with the Russian Bolsheviks, but one that has run through al l the revolution ary movements of th e past. The attempt to pervert all concept ions of beaut y in the sphere of art serves to pave the way for m oral perversion.

This mod ernisti c degener ate cult is simp ly the Bolshevist phi losoph y applied in art. The triumph of Bolshevis m therefore means th e destruct ion of the present æsthet ic system, the transporta tion of al l æsthet ic values, and the deific ation of ugliness. The whole propaganda of the m ovement was said to be or ganiz ed by \"a co terie of Europe an art- dealers\"--e lsewhere described as Germ an--who had flooded the m arket with the work s of art ists w ho began as \"a s mall group of neuroti c ego maniacs in Paris st yling themselves worshippers of Satan, the God of U gliness.\" S ome of these men were suffering fro m the \"visual derange ment\" of the insane, whilst \"many of the pic tures exhib ited another form of m ania.

Thus not onl y his conscious deeds but his subconscious mental processes ma y pass under the control of ano ther, or beco me entire ly deranged. Much the same consequenc es ma y resul t from the Freud s ystem of Ps ycho-Analysis, which, particu larly by its insistenc e on sex, tends to subordina te the will to impulses of a harmful kind. An em inent Amer ican neuro-ps ychiatrist of New York has expressed his opinion on this sub ject in the following words: The Freud theor y is ant i-Christi an and subversive of organized society. Christiani ty teaches tha t the individu al can resist te mptation and Freudis m teach es that the m atter of yielding to or resisting t emptation is one for which the individua l is not wilfull y responsible. Freudism makes of the indiv idual a machine, absolu tely controll ed by subconscious reflex es.... It would of course be difficult to prove that psycho-ana lysis has been evolved as a destructiv e propaganda measure, but in one sense the point is immaterial. Whether conscious or unconscious, it makes for destruc tive effect. 757 In gener al, the art of the conspirac y is not so mu ch to creat e movements as to capture existing m ovements, often innocuous and even admirable in the mselves, and turn them to a subversive purpo se. Thus bir th control, which--if combined with the restrict ion of al ien immigration and carried out under proper direct ion--would provide a solution to the frightfu l proble m of over -populat ion, can without th ese provisos becom e a source of national weakness and dem oralization. It is eas y to see how a l imitation of the native popula tion would serve the cause of England's ene mies by reducing her fight ing forces and by making roo m for undesirable aliens. That the birth- control campaign may also be used for evi l purposes is s uggested by the fac t that it has not been confined to our o wn overcrowded island, but has been carri ed on in France, where under -populat ion has long consti tuted a traged y. In 1903 and 1904 the \"Ligue de la Régénerat ion Hum aine,\" founded by Monsieur Paul Robin, in i ts organ L'Émancipa teur issued not only instruc tions on \"the means how to avoid large families,\" but also pamphlets on \"free love and free m aternity.\" 758 The ca mpaign of race-suicid e was thus com bined with the under mining of mor ality; legal families were to be limited and il legal births encourag ed. This was quit e in ac cord with th e doctrin es of the Grand Orient, in whose Temples, Monsieur Copin Albance lli points out, the princip le of \"l a libre maternité\"--known in this countr y as \"the righ t to m otherhood\"--was advocat ed.

It contains an appeal for help (in m oney) for the Anarch ists imprisoned in Russia ... writt en by Alexand er Berkmann and signed by him with Emma Goldm ann and A. Schapiro. Here, th en, we have a revolution ary movement which is anti- Social ist and even anti- Bolshevist, which tends to prove the opinion I have alread y expressed, that Bolshevism is only one phase of the world-conspirac y. But if we expla in this by the old antagonis m betwe en the oppo sing revolution ary camps of Anarch y and Soci alism, how are we to account for the fact that the sa me destructiv e purpose ani mates people who are neither Anarchist nor Social ist, but can only be ranged in the categor y of extre me reaction? Of this phase of the m ovement Nietzsche provides the supreme example. In his im precations against \"the Crucified,\" the advoc ate of autocra cy and m ilitarism rivals the most infuri ated of revolut ionar y Socia lists. The whole spirit of perversion is conta ined in the descrip tion of Nie tzsche b y his fri end Geor ges Brandes: \"His thoughts stole inquisit ively along forbidden pa ths: 'This thing passes for a valu e. Can we not turn it upside-down ? This is regarded as good. Is it not rather evil? '\" What is this but Satanis m?

P AN -G ERMANISM We have seen in the course of this book tha t the idea of a secret power working for world-revolu tion through both open m ovements and secret societies, is not a new one, but dates from the eighte enth cen tury. In order to apprec iate the continui ty of this id ea, le t us recapitulate the testimonies of conte mporaries, some of which have been alre ady quoted in their context, but which when col lected toge ther and placed in chronologi cal order make up a ver y remarkab le cha in of eviden ce. In 1789 the Marquis de Luche t warned France of the danger of the Illuminati, whose object was world-do mination. 763 In consequenc e of this \"giganti c project\" de Luchet foresees \"a series of cala mities of which the end is lost in the darkness of ti me, like unto those subterr anean fires of w hich the insatiab le activity devours the bowels of the ear th and which escape in to the air b y violent and devastat ing explosions.\" 764 In 1794 the Duke of Brun swick in his m anifesto to the Ger man lodges said: A great sect arose, which, tak ing for its m otto \"the good and happin ess of m an,\" worked in the darkness of the conspirac y to make the happiness of hu manity a pre y for itself. This sect is kno wn to everyone: its brothers are known no less than its na me.... The plan the y had form ed for breaking all social ties and of de stroying all order was reveal ed in their speeches and acts.... Indo mitable pride, thirst of power , such were the onl y motives of this sect: th eir m asters had nothing less in view than the thron es of the ear th, and the govern ment of th e nations was to be direct ed by their nocturna l clubs. 765 In 1797 Montjoie, writing of the Orléaniste conspirac y, to which in an earli er work he had attribu ted the whole or ganiz ation of the French Revolution in its first stages, observed: I will not exa mine whether this wicked prince, thinking he was acting in his personal interests, was not m oved by that invisib le hand 766 which see ms to have crea ted al l the events of our revolut ion in order to lead us towards a goal tha t we do not see at present, but which I think we shal l see before long. 767 In 1801 Monsignor de Savine \"made allusions in prudent and al most terr ified terms to some interna tional sect ...a power superior to all others ...which has arms and e yes everywhere and which governs Europe to-da y.\" 768 In 1817 the Cheval ier de Malet dec lared that \"the authors of th e Revolut ion are not m ore French than Ger man, Italian, Engl ish, etc. They form a particu lar nat ion which took birth"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"and has increased in the dark amidst all civilized nations with th e object of sub jecting them all to its dom ination.\" 769 In 1835 the Carbonaro, Maleg ari, wrote to another member of the Carbonari: We form an association of brothers in al l points of the globe, we have desires and interests in co mmon, we ai m at the e mancipation of hum anity, we wish to break every kind of yoke, yet there is one that is unseen, that can hardl y be felt, yet that weighs on us. Whenc e comes it? Wher e is it? No one kno ws, or at least no one tel ls. The associat ion is secre t, even for u s, the veterans of secret socie ties. 770 In 1852 Disrael i wrote: It was neither parl iaments nor popula tions, nor the course of nature, nor the course of events, that overthrew the throne of Lou is Philippe ...the throne was surprised b y the Secre t Socie ties, ever prepared to ravage Europe.... Acting in unison with a great popular movement they may destro y socie ty, as the y did at the end of th e last centur y. 771 In 1874 Père Descha mps, after his exhaust ive study of secret socie ties, thus propounded the question: We have now to ask our selves whether ther e is an ything but an identi ty of doctr ines and personal communications between the m embers of the different sects, w hether ther e is really a unity of dire ction which binds toge ther al l the secret societies, including Free Masonr y. Here we touch on the m ost mysterious point of the ac tion of secret socie ties, on that which th ese nation al Grand Orients who dec lare themselv es independen t of each other and som etimes even exco mmunicate each other concea l most car efully beneath a veil. 772 Final ly Descha mps is led to the conclusion that there is \"a secret counc il which direc ts all masoni c societ ies,\" 773 that there are secret lairs where the chiefs of the sects agre e together on th eir work of destruct ion. 774 It would be eas y to m ultiply quotat ions of this kind taken fro m many different sources. Whether the men who expressed these opinions were, as we are frequentl y told, suf fering from delusions or not, the fact remains th at the idea of a hidden hand behind world- revolu tion has existed for at least 135 y ears. And when we com pare these ut teranc es with Monsieur Copin Albance lli's descript ion of an inn er circ le secre tly direct ing the activ ities of the Grand O rient, and with the conclusions reach ed by members of other secre t socie ties, tha t such a c ircle exists behind all occult and m asonic societ ies of a subversive kind, we are necessari ly led to enquire : is there one cir cle or rather one Power behind both open and secret organiza tions working for the overthrow of the existing socia l order and Christian c ivilization? If so, what is this power? Now, to leav e specula tion for the m oment and come to known facts, ever yone who has seriousl y studied these matters is aware tha t there are a t the present m oment five princip al"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"organiz ed movements at work in the world with which ordered governm ent has to contend, tha t may be sum marized as follows: 1. Grand Orient Freem asonr y. 2. Theosoph y with its innu merable ramifications. 3. Nation alism of an aggressive kind, now represen ted by Pan-Ger manism. 4. Intern ational Financ e. 5. Socia l Revolu tion. It will be seen that, with the exception of the fourth, these m ovements are those of which I have endeavoured to trac e the course throughout the ear lier part of this book. It is a highl y signific ant fac t that it was only when I had reached this stage of m y work I discover ed there were independ ent inv estigators who had arrived at precise ly the same conclusions as m yself. The proble m that now confronts us is ther efore this: if ther e is indeed one power direc ting all subversive m ovements, is it one of th e five mov ements here enu merated or is it yet anoth er power m ore potent and mo re inv isible? In order to discover this, it is necessar y to consider whether these movements, although apparent ly diver gent in their ultimate purpose, have neverthe less an y ideas or an y aims in common. One funda mental point of similarity will certa inly be found between them. All desire to do minate the world and to direct it along lines and according to rules of the ir own devising; more than this, each desires to direct it solely for the benefit of one cl ass of peopl e--socia l, inte llectual, or national as the case may be--to the en tire exclusion of ever y hum an being outside that class. Thus in reali ty each aspires to the dictatorship of the world. Besides th is, it wil l be not iced that not only these principa l movements, but also the minor subversive m ovements describ ed in the last chapter , have in the m ain (1) a pro- German tendenc y--none, at any rate, are pro-French nor do the y encourag e Brit ish patriotism, (2) all contain a Jewish ele ment--none, at le ast, are \"anti- Semite,\" and (3) al l have a more or less decided antagonis m to Christi anity. If then, th ere is a single power behind them, is it th e Pan-Germ anic Power ? Is it the Jewish Power ? Or is it the Anti- Christi an Power ? Let us exam ine each of these possibili ties in turn. Viewed under the aspect of exaggera ted Nat ionalis m, the spirit of Pan-Ger manism is nothing new. The drea m of world-do mination has haunted the imagination of m any races from the ti me of Alexander the Great to Napoleon I, but nowhere has the plan been carried out by the Machi avellian methods which have charac terized Prus sian foreign policy and dip lomacy from the days of Frederick the Great onwards. It is not Pru ssian militarism that const itutes the cri me of m odern Germ any. Militar ism in the sense of courag e, patrio tism, disciplin e, and devot ion to duty is a splendid thing. But the spiri t of Pan-Ger manism differs fro m the Brit ish concept ion of patr iotism in tha t it overrides the rights of all other peoples and seeks to establ ish its do mination over the whole world. Under Ger man dom ination ever y Germ an would be free and ever y other hu man being a slave. England, whilst seeking conquests, has, on the other hand, alwa ys allowed the inhab itants of conquered territor ies to deve lop along their own lines and has m ade use of"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"legislation lar gely to prot ect them from each other . The preferenc e of the native of India for an English judge to one of his own race is evidenc e of this fact. But it is further the abandon ment of all principl e, the accep tance of the doctr ine that ever ything is allowabl e-- lying, treachery, calumny, and bad fai th--in order to achi eve its end, that has placed Germany outside the comity of nat ions. Robison describes the system of the Illuminati as leading to the conc lusion tha t \"nothing would be scrupled at, if i t could be m ade appear that the Order would derive advantage from it, because the great object of the Order was held as superior to ever y considerat ion.\" 775 Change the word O rder to State, and one has the whole princ iple of mod ern Ger man Imperialism. Now, it is in teresting to noti ce that the founders of Germ an Illuminism and of Ger man Imper ialism drew cert ain of th eir ide as from the same source. Both Weishaup t and Frederi ck the Great were earn est students of Machi avelli--and both out-did their master. This form of Machiave llism, carried to a point probabl y never drea mt of b y the Ital ian philosophe r, has run through the whole struggle of Prussia for supre macy and at the same time through each outbreak of world revo lution in which Prus sian influen ce has pla yed a part. Thus the E ms telegra m in 1870, the false report tha t tricked Russia into mobilization in 1914, 776 the viola tion of tr eaties and of al l the laws of civil ised warfare during the recent war , were the dire ct outco me of doctrines tha t may be found in e mbryo in The Prince . So also the most striking charac teristic of the French Revolu tion under the inspira tion of Weishaupt's e missari es and the agents of Prus sia, and of the present revolu tionar y movement inaugur ated by Karl Marx and Friedri ch Engels, is not so mu ch its violenc e as its Machi avellian cunning. The ar t popularl y known to-da y as camouflag e --of dressing-up one design under the guise of s omething quite different, of making bla ck appear white by glorifying the most ignobl e actions, of m aking white appear black by holding up all honourab le trad itions to conte mpt and ridicul e, in a word perversion --has been reduced to a system by the secret directors of world revo lution. It is here that we can dete ct the non-prole tarian charac ter of th e movement. The working-ma n of all countr ies is the least Machi avellian of beings; his weakness lies in the fact tha t he is too inarti culate, tha t he does not know how to put his case even when he has a good one, still less to make a bad one appear plausibl e. It was not unti l world revolu tion was taken over by the fact ion describ ed by Bakunin as \"the Ger man- Jew Co mpan y\" that it reassu med its Machiav ellian char acter and gradual ly became the for midable organizat ion it is to-da y. A few extr acts fro m The Prince will show ho w closely both the Prus sians and the Terrorists of France and Rus sia have followed Machiav elli's manual for despots: \"He who usurp s the governm ent of an y State is to exe cute and put in practi ce all the cruelties which he thinks material at once, that he ma y have no occasion to renew the m often,\" etc. 777 (Vide the Germ an prin ciple of \"frightfuln ess\" to be exerc ised against the inhab itants of invaded territor y and the plan of the French and Russian Terrorists in suppressing \"counter -revolu tionar ies.\")"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"\"It is of s uch importan ce to a prince to take upon hi m the nature and disposition of a beast ; of al l the whole flock he ought to i mitate the lion and the fox.\" 778 (Vide Frederi ck the Great and the de magogues of France and Russia.) \"A princ e ... who is wise and prudent, cannot or ought not to keep his parole, when the keeping of it is to his prejudice, and the causes for w hich he pro mised removed.\" 779 (Vide Germany's doctr ine of the scrap of paper and the pro mises of the Bolshevist Trade Deleg ation in London to refrain from propaganda.) \"Because the whole multitude which subm its to your governm ent is not capab le of be ing armed, if y ou be benefic ial and obliging to those you do arm , you may make the bolder with the rest, for th e differenc e of y our behav iour to the soldier binds him more firmly to your servic e,\" etc. 780 (Vide the insolent behaviour perm itted to of ficers of the Germ an Imper ial Army and th e feeding of the Red Army in Russia at the expense of the rest of the popula tion.) \"The prince ... is obliged ... at conveni ent times in the y ear to ent ertain the people b y feastings and pla ys and spectacles of recrea tion ... and give the m some inst ance of his humanity and ma gnificenc e.\" 781 (Vide the importan t part played by \"spect acles\" in the French Revolution and b y the theatr e and opera in Soviet Russia. Alwa ys the sa me plan of \" panem ei circenses !\") Just after the fal l of Napoleon I a French writer published a book describing the \"methodic perversit y\" of the revolu tionar y leaders and the Revolu tion as the beginning of a Machiavellian régime. 782 How did this s ystem come to be establ ished in France unless under the guidanc e of Weishaupt's em issaries and the agen ts of Frederick the Great and of the Illuminatus Freder ick William II? Germany was well able, howeve r, to defend herself aga inst the devastat ing doctr ines of Illuminism. Alwa ys the hom e of secret societ ies, she beca me by the end of the ninete enth century the spiritual hom e of Socialism. Yet although this m ight appear to present a danger to Ger man Imperialism, no coun try has re mained so free as Ger many from serious agitation. It has been well said that the Ger mans are theore tically more Socia listic than other nations, but they are far less revolut ionar y. The truth is th at the rulers of Ger many have alwa ys known that they could count not merely on th e servili ty of the people but on their ardent nationa l spirit. A strong ve in of patriotism ran through a ll the secret societies even of the most subversive vari ety, and it was the Ger man Student Orders, whence the Illu minati drew the ir discip les, tha t beca me also the recrui ting-ground for the Ger man Imperialist idea. Instead of com bating subversive forces, Germ an Imper ialism adopted the far more skilful expedien t of enlisting them in its service. It was thus tha t in Ger many Free masonr y became a powerful aid to Prus sian aggrand izement. From 1840 on wards the word of co mmand to all the lodg es went out from Berlin, 783 and in the revo lution of 1848 the Free masons of Ger many showed"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":"themselves the most arden t supporters of Germ an unity under th e ægis of Pru ssia.

Dammer, who succeeded Lassalle as head of the Social ist part y, instruct ed his successor Fritsche tha t \"in the m eetings which took place in Saxon y, whilst putt ing forward Socia list cl aims, they must not fail to de mand the unity of Germ any under the do mination of Pru ssia. Fritsch e was personall y to render an account to Bism arck of the results obta ined at these meetings.\" 784 Even as far afie ld as Ita ly, Bismarck succeeded in imposing the polic y of Ger man autocracy on me n who were ostensibl y marching in the vanguard of \"lib erty.\" \"I believ e in the unit y of Germ any,\" Mazzini wrote to Bis marck in 1867, \"and I desire it as I desire that of m y own countr y. I abhor the empire and suprem acy that France arroga tes to herself over Europe.\" 785 Before 1870 Freem asonr y everywhere on the Continent helped the cause of Germ any. \"The Occult Power prea ched pac ifism and hum anitarianism in France by means of French Freemasonr y whilst i t preach ed patrio tism in Germ any by means of Germ an Freemasonr y.\" 786 So although throughout the nine teenth centur y the rulers of Germ any permitted the dissemination of ide as antagonist ic to relig ion, unti l by the dawn of the following centur y the ver y idea of God was rooted out of the m inds of ma ny German children, th e Imperi al Govern ment was carefu l that nothing should be allowed to weaken patriotism. Indeed, the Pan-Germ an obsession into which Germ an pa triotism beca me transfor med under the influen ce of such m en as Treitschke and Bernhardi was, no less than revolut ionar y Socia lism, fortified by irreligion bec ause founded on the law of force and the absence of all moral scruple. It is thus not \"militarism\" in the accep ted sense tha t has rendered Germ any a menace to the world, but the Machiave llian plan of using for export doctrin es sternl y repressed with in her own borders. I shall not enl arge here on the cri me of the Germ an Imperial Staff in sending Lenin and his fel low Bolsheviks to Russia, bec ause I have alread y dealt at leng th with this question in a controvers y that appe ared in the Morning Post two y ears ago. 787 But whilst acknowl edging the fair and courteous lin e of ar gument adopt ed by my German opponent, with which on certa in points I found m yself completely in agree ment.

Undoubt edly England did propagate Pacifis m in Germ any and other ene my countri es and hoped to bring about a polit ical revolut ion, tha t is to sa y, a rising of the Ger man people against the rulers who had led them into war . (It should be remembered that all the friends of Germ any in th is countr y alwa ys declared that the German people did not want the war and were dragged into it unwill ingly by the m ilitary caste.) But is ther e any evidence to sho w that Eng land ever attempted to engin eer a social revolu tion, to underm ine morality and all belief in ordered governm ent, in a word to promote Bolshevis m in Ger many or elsewhere ? Herr Kerlen cites the s ympathy accorded in this countr y to the Kerensk y revolu tion. But England, largely through the influenc e of the Liber als, had alwa ys entertained an exaggera ted ide a of \"Tzar ist tyranny,\" and honestl y sympathized with all efforts, ho wever misguided, to \"liber ate\" the Russian peopl e. Further , throughout the war the Tzar and Tzarina had been cease lessly represen ted as fai thless to the Allies--a stor y that we now kno w to have been an infa mous calumny circula ted doubt less b y enemy agents.

I kno w fro m personal experi ence that two of the most importan t Governm ent depart ments were completely mistaken even on the subject of Bolshevis m, with the result tha t measur es were not tak en which m ight have checked its spread into th is countr y. In a word, then, the essenti al dif ference between the attitude of Germ any and England to Russia was that whilst England imagined th at the Kerensk y revolut ion would be for the good of Russia as well as for the advan tage of the Allies, Ger many deliber ately introdu ced in to Rus sia what she knew to be a poison. Alwa ys faithfu l to th e maxim of divide et impera , Germ any, after bringing Russia to ruin, has at last succe eded in causing dissensions between th e Allies. This poli cy she pursued unremittingly throughout the war. Thus whilst on one hand she was assuring the French that \"the English would figh t to th e last breath of th e last French man,\" Genera l Ludendorf f was instruc ting the I mper ial Chancel lor that : \"We must aga in and again rub in the sentence in Kuhl mann's speech to the ef fect tha t the question of Alsace-Lorra ine is th e only one which stands in the way of peace.

Although there was no countr y in the world where mon archy was so adored, m ilitarism so universal ly admired, where rank and birth played so impor tant a part, and the working classes, though cared for , so rigid ly kept in sub jection, Ger many from the time of Bis marck onwards has alwa ys been th e \"spiritua l home\" of British Socialists, de mocrats, and pacifists, ju st as in France she has alwa ys found her principa l allies in the m asonic lodges. And this although the Ger man Social ists and Free masons have never at tempted to use the ir influ ence in favour of the mason ic and Social ist idea l of universa l brotherhood and world-peace, but, on the con trary, at ever y crisis have thrown in their lot with the military party. Thus before the Franco-Pru ssian War, whilst French Free masons of the Loge Concordia and the Socialists of th e First Interna tionale were urging their brothers to rely on Germ an Socia lism to avert a confli ct, the Prus sian lodges were shouting Hoch! to the nation al colours and chant ing the praises of King William and \"the Prussian sword,\" and the Ger man Social Democrats were app lauding the cause of Germ an unit y. 791 Exactly the sa me thing happened before the rec ent war , when Jaurès assured his fel low- Socia lists tha t at the first sign of conflic t he had only to co mmunicate with Berlin in order to enlist German Social ism in the int erests of peac e; yet on the declara tion of w ar the German Social ists voted solidl y for war credi ts, whilst the British Socia lists opposed participation in the war and even in some instances expres sed sympathy with Germ any. And let it never be for gotten, it was not Socialist Germ any but Imperial Ger many that won the alleg iance of our s o-called democrats. In spite of this betr ayal by the Socia lists of Ger many, in spite of the fac t that they have contr ibuted nothing to the cause of Internat ional Social ism or of world-peac e, the British \"Labour\" Party never until its acc ession to of fice wavered in i ts polic y of publicl y advoc ating the cause of Germ any. With the except ion of the Social Demo cratic Federa tion, ever y Social ist bod y in this countr y has procl aimed pro-Ger man senti ments, and Justice alone, of all Socialist organs, ha s expressed its sympathy for th e sufferings of France. In fact, any Social ist who dared to cham pion the cause of France i mmediately lost his influenc e and position in Socia list circles. As to the Daily Herald , had it been edited in Berlin it could not m ore faithfu lly have supported Ger man interests. When Alsace Lorraine was restored to France, it publ ished an art icle sho wing how deep ly the inhab itants of this province resented being transferr ed fro m the Germ an Empire to the French Republic 792 ; when a general strike thr eaten ed this coun try, it seized the opportuni ty to come out with an appe al in enorm ous capi tals to revise the Versail les Treaty; in the m atter of reparat ions its ef forts to let Germ any off altog ether have been, as it itself observed, \"unceasing.\" \"The pla in fac t is,\" it declar ed on Dece mber 17, 1921, \"that these fantasti c repara tion demands cannot be m et; and that every payment by which Germany attempts to meet them will onl y work further havoc to our o wn co mmerce and our own industr y.

At th e very moment that i t was advocat ing the Labour poli cy of a cap ital levy on all fortunes exc eeding £5,000 in this coun try, the Daily Herald waxed a lmost te arful over the iniqui ty of France in att empting to touch the pockets of Ger man multi-millionaires whose profits, it went on to exp lain elabora tely, were not near ly as huge as m ight appear in view of the dec line in the purchasing power of the mark. The declin e in th e purchasing power of the pound had, however , never been tak en into account when as sessing the profits of British e mployers of labou r. 794 We have only to follow point b y point the polic y of th e Brit ish Labour Part y since the war to recognize that whilst the measures it advocat ed might be of doubtfu l benefi t to the workers, there could be no doubt whatever of the benef it the y would confer on Ger many. With a million and a quarter unem ployed and lar ge numb ers of the working c lasses unabl e to find hom es, the profes sed represen tatives of Labour have persistent ly clamoured for the re moval of restr ictions on alien immigration and al ien imports. So although through the Trade Unions the British worker was to be rigorousl y protect ed against co mpetition fro m his fellow-Briton, no obstacles were to be pla ced in the wa y of competition b y foreign, and frequen tly underpa id, labou r. That this glar ing betr ayal of their interests should not have raised a storm of resent ment amongst the working classes is surel y evidence that the Marxian doctrin e \"the emancipation of the working classes must be brought about by the working cl asses themselves\" 795 has so far led to no great results. Emerson trul y observed : \"So far as a m an thinks, he is free.\" The working c lasses can never be free unti l they learn to think for th emselves instead of al lowing the ir think ing to be done for the m by the middle- class exploi ters of Labou r. The hand of Germ any behind Socia lism must be apparen t to al l those who do not deliberately shut their eyes to the fact, and it is signif icant to noti ce tha t the nearer Socia lism approaches to Bolshevism the more marked this inf luence beco mes. Thus although cer tain Socialist groups, s uch as the Social Dem ocratic Federation in England and the Socia list Part y in France, have not beco me Ger manized, the avowed Com munists in all the Allied coun tries are strongl y pro-Ger man. This is the case even in France, where the Bolsheviks find ferven t supporters in the group led by Marcel Cach in, Froissart, and Longue t, grandson of Karl Marx. The organiza tion of the Bolshevist mov ement has indeed throughout owed a great dea l of its efficien cy to Ger man co-opera tion, provided not onl y by the Socia list but by the Monarchist elements in Germany. It is necessar y in this connexion to understand the dual character of the Ger man Monarchist par ty since the ending of the war . The great major ity of its adherents, ani mated by nothing more repreh ensible than the spirit of mi litarism and an aggres sive form of patr iotism that clings to the old formu la of Deutschland über all es , are probabl y strangers to an y intrigues, but behind this m ass of honest I mperialists, and"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"doubtl ess unkno wn to a great numb er, ther e lurk those sinister or ganizations the Pan- German secret societies.

Moreover , as in th e time of Weishaupt, Bavar ia is sti ll a centre for secret-socie ty intrigue, and it was here that Escher ich founded the Einwohnerwehr sometimes known as the Orgesch or O rganization Escheri ch, with Munich as its headquart ers. The Or gesch wa s followed b y the form idable murder club known to al l the world as the Or ganiza tion C or \"Con sul,\" named aft er its founder , the famous Captain Ehrhardt, whose nickn ame was \" der Her r Consul .\" During the year 1921 no less than 400 polit ical assassina tions were report ed in Ger many and said to be the work of secret societies. Amongst the crimes attribu ted to the in itiative of O rganization C were th e murders of Herr Erzb erger and the attempt on the l ife of Herr Scheid emann. Eighty persons arrested for com plicity in the murder of Herr Rath enau were a lso said to be members of the same socie ty. 796 But as in the case of all secret societies, the visibl e lead ers were not the real hierarch y; behind this ac tive body there ex isted an inner circ le organised on ma sonic lines, the Druidenorden, a name unknown to the publ ic, and behind this again anoth er and sti ll more secret circl e which appe ars to be na meless. It is these inner rings which, whilst remaining Monarch ist in Germ any, work for other ends abroad, and are connect ed with the world-revolut ionar y movement. This alliance between the two extre mes of ardent Monarch ism and revolution ary Socia lism existed at the beginning of th e war or even ear lier, and, as is now well known, it was the Jewish S ocial Demo crat, Israel Lazarewit ch, al ias Helphandt alias Parvu s, who arrang ed with the Germ an Genera l Staf f for the passage of Lenin from Switzer land to Russia, acco mpanied by Karl Radek, the Austrian Jew deserter , and a nu mber of other Jews. Now, Switzerland has been for hundreds of y ears a centre of revolut ionar y and secret- socie ty intrigue. As earl y as the sixt eenth centur y the Pope, writing to the King s of France and Spain, warned the m that Geneva was \"un fo yer étern el de révolut ion,\" and Joseph de Maistre, quoting th is letter in 1817, declared Geneva to be the metropol is of the revolu tionar ies, who se art of decep tion he describes as \"the great European secre t.\" 797 Elsewher e, a y ear earli er, he had referred to Illu minism as the root of a ll the evil at work. It is no w known that at the moment de Maistre wrote these words an inner ring of revolu tionar ies, cla iming direc t descent from Weishaupt and even fro m an earli er sect existing at the end of the fift eenth centur y, profited by the fal l of Napoleon I to reconstru ct its organizat ion and took up its headquar ters in Switzerland with branch offices in London and Paris. The same secre t ring of Il luminati is believ ed to have been intimately connect ed with th e organiza tion of the Bolshevist revolut ion, although none of"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"the leading Bolsheviks are said to have been m embers of the inner most circl e, which is understood to consist of m en belonging to the highest int ellectual and finan cial classes whose nam es remained absolutel y unknown. O utside this absolut ely secre t ring th ere existed, however , a semi-secre t circ le of high initiates of subversive societies drawn from all over th e world and belong ing to various nationa lities--Ger man, Jewish, French, Russian, and even Japanese. This group, which might be described as the act ive ring of the inner c ircle, appears to have been in touch with, if not in control of, a co mmittee which met in Switzerland to carr y out the program me of the Third Interna tional e. It was thus in Switzerland that at the same time high init iates of Pan-Germ an secret socie ties forega thered and that an act ive centre of pro-Germ an, ant i-Enten te, and even Bolshevist propaganda was estab lished. These Germans, although Monarch ists themselves, co- operated with the secret revolu tionar y forces in stirr ing up trouble in the countr ies of the Allies. At the same time the conferen ces of the Second Internat ionale, attended by members of the Brit ish I.L.P . took place in Switzer land, and at one of these-- the Berne Conferen ce of 1919--the deleg ates were en tertained b y a mysterious \"American\" m illionaire, John de Ka y, living himself in great style, paying for press servic e at the rat e of 2,000 francs a da y, lavishing money on the conferenc e, and a t the same time subsidizing a Pacifist and Defeat est paper named La Feui lle . It is im possible, then, to ignor e the role of Ger many in the present outbreak of world revolu tion. In the Brit ish White Paper on Bolshevis m in Rus sia we find it stated by an Englishman who had been through the whole of the Revolution in tha t countr y that: The Germ ans init iated disturbanc es in order to reduce Russia to chaos. They print ed masses of paper mon ey to finance their schemes; the notes, of which I posses s speci mens, can be easil y recogniz ed by a speci al mark. 798 What has Germ any to say to all this? Simply that the prom otion of Bolshevism was a military \"necessit y\" in order to bring about the downfall of her opponents, but that the propagand a utilized by her was in real ity of Jewish origin, and that Jewr y, not Germ any, was the rea l author of world revolut ion. It is eas y to see how such a theor y can be m ade to serve the cause of Pan-Germ anism. For if Germ any can persuade us that the Jew s alone were responsible for the war and were also the sole authors of Bolshevism , we shall natural ly be led to the conclusion that Germany is, after all, innocent of the cri mes attributed to her , and that our onl y safet y lies in forgoing reparat ions, restoring her to her for mer power , and coa lescing with her against a co mmon ene my. We shall therefore do well to accept with extr eme caution advice on the Jewish que stion emanating from German sources, and to test the sincer ity of the spirit in which it is offered b y considering the relat ions w hich have hi therto existed betwe en the Germ ans and the Jews. Now, Germ any has long been the hom e of m odern \"anti- Semitism.\" Although in ever y countr y and at every period, but m ore particu larly in the East of Europe during the last century, the Jews have suffered from unpopulari ty, it was Germ any that organized this"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"aversion into a definit e plan of ca mpaign. If in Russia, Gal icia, and Poland th e Jew s have met with sporadi c violen ce at the hands of the peasants, in Germ any they have been systematically held up b y the authori ties to hatred and conte mpt. Luth er, Kant, Fichte, Schopenhau er, Treitschk e, successivel y inveighed against the Jewish race. Jews were denied ad mission to m asonic lodges and to the rank of officers in the army, whilst societ y excluded the m up to the outbre ak of war . Yet the extraord inary fact re mains tha t of al l nations the Ger mans have alwa ys been the favouri tes of the Jews. Throughout the whole m ovement for the unifi cation of Ger many under the ægis of Prus sia, Jews pla yed a lead ing part, and in th e recen t war Germ any found in them some of her m ost valu able allies. As Maxim ilian Harden recent ly point ed out: \"The servic es of the Jews to Germ any during the war were enorm ous. The patr iotism of the Jews was be yond reproach, in m any cases even ludi crous and of fensive in its intensity.\" And in spite of \"anti- Semitism,\" Harden decl ares: \"Ther e is a strong af finity betwe en the Germ an and the Jew.\" 799 To the Ashkena zim Germ any even more than Palest ine has appe ared the Land of Promise. Thus s ome years before the war Profes sor Ludwig Geiger , leader of the Liber al Jews of Berlin, denounced \"Z ionist sophis ms\" in the words: \"The Ger man Jew w ho has a voic e in German literatur e must, as he has been accustom ed to for the last centur y and a ha lf, look upon Ger many alone as his fatherl and, upon the Germ an langu age as his m other-tongue, and the future of that nation must remain the only one upon w hich he bases his hopes.\" 800 How are we to expl ain this unrequit ed devotion? Si mply by the Ger man polic y of enlisting every dynamic force in her servic e. She has known ho w to use the Jew s just as she has known ho w to use the Free masons, th e Illu minati, and the Socia lists for the purpose of Pan-Ger manism. From Frederick the Great, who em ployed the Jew Ephrai m to coin false money, to William II, who kept in tou ch with Rath enau b y means of a priva te telephone wire, the rulers of Germ any have alwa ys allowed the m to co-opera te in their sche mes of w orld-domination. As the allies of Bism arck, who used the m freel y to fill his war -chests, the Jews direct ed the power of the secre t societ ies in th e inter ests of Germany; in 1871 th e Jew Bloechre ider ac ted as adviser to the new Germ an Empire as to the best m ethod of wresting inde mnities fro m France. And Germ any, whilst heaping insults on the Jew s, never theless fulf ils cert ain conditions essenti al to Je wish en terprise. Unlike England and France, she has never allowed herself to be seriousl y weakened by democratic ide as, and therefor e to th e Jew s--as to British bel ievers in autocrac y--she represen ts the princ iple of stabil ity. Moreover , Germ any as the hom e of m ilitarism offers a wide field for Je wish specula tion. We have only to coupl e toge ther an aphorism of Mirabeau's with one of Werner Sombart's to perceive the bond of union between the two races, thus: \"W ar is the nat ional industr y of Prussia\" and \"Wars are the Jew s' harvests.\" As long ago as 1793 Anacharsis Cloot z, the apostle of universal broth erhood and defend er of the Jewish race, declared that if Germany were to be prevented from going to war the Jews must be persuaded to withdraw their support fro m her m ilitary adventur es:"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"War could not begin or last in Germany without the ac tivity, the intelligence, and the money of the Jews. Magazines and mun itions of all kinds are provided by Hebre w capitalists and al l the subaltern agents of m ilitary provision ment are of the sa me nation. We have only to co me to an understanding with our brothers, the Rabbis, to produce astonishing, miraculous results. 801 Mr. Ford, the Americ an motor-car manufa cturer , appears to have arrived at much the same conclusion expres sed in the words recen tly attribut ed to him: \"We don't need the League of Nations to end war . Put under control the fif ty most weal thy Jewish financi ers, who produce wars for their own profit, and wars will cease.\" 802 On another occasion Mr. Ford is report ed to have said tha t the Jews who vo yaged with him in the Peace ship in 1915 \"went out of their wa y to convince\" him of \"th e direc t relations be tween the Internat ional Jew and the war\": they \"went in to deta ils to tell me the means by which the Jews control led the war--how the y had the mon ey, how the y had corner ed all the basic materials needed to fight the war ,\" etc. 803 Without in an y way absolving Germ any from the cri me of the war, it is necessar y to tak e this secondar y factor into consideration if pea ce betwe en the nations is to be established. For as long as the lust of war lingers in the hearts of the Germ ans and the lust of gain at the price of hum an suf fering l ingers in the hearts of the Jews, both races will remain necessary to each other and the hideous nigh tmare of war will con tinue to brood over the world. There is then a great deal of truth in the Socia list phrase \"Capita lists' Wars,\" although not in the sense the y attribu te to it. For it will be noticed that the Cap italists who are m ost instru mental in m aking wars are prec isely those w hom the Socia lists are alwa ys carefu l to shield from blame. The following inc ident will illustra te this point. At a meeting of the Social Democratic Federa tion Mr . Adolphe S mith moved a resolution appealing to the organized workers of Great Britain- - Not to perm it themselves in the suppo sed in terests of the ir fellow-w orkers in other countr ies, to be used by sinister finan cial and m ilitarist inf luences merely to weaken th e Entente nations in the present critical situat ion, and ur ging them to keep car eful watch against such m anoeuvr es on the part of pro-Germ an internat ional financ iers, who were able to exer cise consider able react ionar y influence among th e wealth y and of ficial classes in this countr y. 804 Mr. Hyndman added tha t \"the most serious danger b y which we w ere threat ened was from the m ost powerful group of capit alists in Europe head ed by Hugo Stinnes and backed by Hindenbur g, Ludendorf f, and the m ilitarist party in Germany.\" This resolut ion was opposed b y a member of the Parlia mentar y Labour Part y and eventu ally withdrawn. The connexion between Ger man Imperialism, Internat ional Finance, Illuminism, Bolshevis m, and cert ain sections of Brit ish Socialism is thus apparen t. Is Germ any then"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"the secret power behind the thing we ca ll Bolshev ism? Are Illuminism and Pan- Germanism one and the sa me thing? To this hypothesis two ob jections present themselves: firstl y, that th e spirit of Illu minism and Bolshevism exist ed, as we have seen in earli er chapt ers of this book, long before modern Germany came into existenc e; and secondl y, that Germ any herself is not ent irely free fro m the contag ion.

It is clear , then, th at besides Pan-G ermanism there is anoth er power at work, a power far older, that seeks to destro y all national spirit, all ordered governm ent in ever y countr y, Germany included. What is this power ? A large bod y of opinion replies: the Jewish power . 15. T HE R EAL J EWISH P ERIL In consider ing the immense proble m of the Jewish Po wer, perhaps the most import ant proble m with which the m odern world is confronted, it is nec essar y to divest oneself of all prejudices and to enquire in a spiri t of scient ific detach ment whether an y definit e proof exists that a concert ed att empt is being m ade by Jewr y to ach ieve world- domination and to obl iterate the Christi an faith. That such a purpose has existed amongst the Jew s in the past has been shown throughout the earlier chap ters of this book. The concept ion of the Jews as the Chosen People who must eventua lly rule the world forms indeed the basis of Rabbini cal Judais m. It is custom ary in this countr y to sa y that we s hould respect the Jewish religion, and this would cer tainly be our dut y were the Jewish relig ion founded, as is popular ly supposed, solely on the Old Testament. For although we do not consider ourselves bound to observe the ritua l of the Pentateu ch, we find no faul t with the Jew s for carr ying out what they conceive to be the ir religious duties. Moreover , although the Old Testament depicts the Jews a s a favoured race- -a concep tion which we believ e to have been superseded by the Christi an dispensat ion, whereb y all men are dec lared equal in the sight of G od-- never theless it does conta in a ver y lofty law of righ teousness applic able to all mankind. It is bec ause of their universal ity that the books of J ob and E cclesi astes, as also m any passages in the Psalms, in Isaiah, and the minor prophets, have m ade an und ying appe al to the hu man race. But the Jewish relig ion now takes i ts stand on the Talmud rath er than on the Bible. \"The m odern Jew,\" one of its la test Jewish transla tors ob serves, \"is the"},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"product of the Talmud.\" 805 The Talmud itself accords to the Bible only a secondar y place. Thus the Talmudic treatise Soferi m says: \"The Bib le is l ike water , the Mischna is like wine, and the Ge mara is lik e spiced wine.\" Now, the Talmud is not a law of righteousness for all mankind, but a m eticulous code applying to the Jew alone. No human being outside the Jewish race could possibl y go to the Talmud for he lp or co mfort. One m ight look through its pages in vain for an y such splendid rule of l ife as tha t given by the prophet Micah: \"He hath shewed thee, O ma n, what is good; and what doth the Lord require of th ee, but to do j ustly, and to lov e mercy, and to walk hu mbly with th y God? \" In the Talmud, on th e contrar y, as Drach points out, \"the precepts of justice, of equit y, of chari ty towards one's neighbour , are not onl y not applicable with regard to th e Christian, but consti tute a crime in anyone who w ould act differen tly.... The Talmud expressl y forbids one to save a non-Je w fro m death, ... to restore lost goods, etc., to hi m, to have pi ty on hi m.\" 806 How far the Talmud has contribu ted to the ant i-socia l tenden cies of m odern Judaism is shown b y the fac t that the Karaites liv ing in the south of Russia, the only body of Jew s which takes its stand on the Bibl e, and not on the Talmud,- -of which it only accepts such portions as are in ac cordance with Bibl e teaching- -have alwa ys shown them selves good subjects of the Russian E mpire, and have ther efore enjo yed equa l rights with the Russian peopl e around the m. Cath erine the Great particu larly favoured the Karait es. Thus even the Jews are not unani mous in supporting the Talmud; indeed, as we have already seen, many Jews have protested against it as a barri er between themselves and the rest of the hu man race. But it is in the Caba la, stil l more than in the Talmud, that the Judaic dream of w orld- domination recurs with the great est persistenc e. The Zohar indeed refers to this as a fait accompl i , expl aining that \"the Feast of Taberna cles is th e period when Israel triumphs over the other people of the world; th at is wh y during th is feast we seize the Lou lab [branches of trees ti ed togeth er] and carr y it as a troph y to show that we have conquered all the other peopl es known a s 'populac e' and tha t we dom inate them.\" 807 God is, however , asked to accord these other peoples a certa in share of blessings, \"so that occup ied with this share the y shall not partic ipate nor m ingle with the jo y of Israel when he calls down blessings from on high.\" The situat ion m ay thus be co mpar ed with th at of a king who, wishing to give a feast to his speci al friends, finds his hou se invaded b y impor tunate governors de mand ing ad mittance. \"What then does the king do? He orders the governors to be served with beef and vegetab les, which are common food, and then sits down to tab le with his friends and has the most delicious dishes served.\" 808 But this is nothing to the feasting tha t is to take pl ace when th e Mes sianic era arrives. After the return of the Jews from all nations and parts of the world to Palestine, the Messiah, we are told in the Talmud, will ent ertain the m at a gor geous banquet, where they will be seated at golden tab les and rega led with wine from Adam's wine-ce llar. The first course is to consist of a roasted ox nam ed Behem oth, so immense that every day it eats up the grass upon a thousand hills; the second of a mo nstrous fish Levi athan ; the third of"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"a female Levi athan boiled and pickl ed; the fourth of a giganti c roast fowl known as Barjuchne, of which the egg alone was so enorm ous that when it fel l out of the nest i t crushed thr ee hundred tall cedars and th e white overflowed threescor e villages. This course is to be followed up b y \"the m ost splend id and po mpous Dessert\" tha t can be procured, includ ing fruit from the Tree of Life and \"the Pomegranat es of Eden which are preserved for the Just.\" At the end of the banquet \"God will enter tain the co mpany at a ball\" ; He Hi mself will sit in the m idst of the m, and ever yone will poin t Him out with his finger , saying: \"Beho ld, this is our G od: we have waited for Him , we will be glad and rejoice in His salva tion.\" 809 The eighte enth- centur y commentator, whose sum mary of these passages we quote, goes on to observe : But let us see a little after what manner th e Jew s are to liv e in the ir anc ient Countr y under the Administr ation of the Messiah. In the First Place, the strange Nations, which the y shall suffer to live, shall bui ld the m Houses and Cities, t ill them Ground, and plant them Vineyards; and all this, without so much as looking for an y Reward of their Labour . These surviv ing Nations will likewise voluntar ily offer th em all their Wealth and Furniture : And Princes and Nobles s hall attend them ; and be read y at the ir Nod to pa y them all Manner of Obedien ce; while they themselv es shall be surrounded with Grandeur and Pleasure, appear ing abroad in Apparel glittering with Jewels like Priests of the Unction, consecrat ed to God.... In a word, the felic ity of this Hol y Nation, in the Times of the Messiah, will be such, tha t the exalted Condit ion of it cannot enter into the Concept ion of Man; m uch less can it be couch ed in hu man Expression. This is what the Rabbis sa y of it. But the intelligent read er will doubtless pronounce it the Paradise of Fools. 810 It is interest ing to not ice that this concept ion of the manner in which the return to Palest ine is to be carri ed out has descend ed to cer tain of the m odern colonists. Sir Geo rge Adam Smith, aft er watching Zionis m at work in 1918, w rote: On visiting a recen tly established Jewish colon y in the north-east of the land, round which a high wall had been bui lt by the munificent patron, I found th e colonists sitting in its shade gambling awa y the morning, whil e groups of fellahin at a poor wage did the cultivation for th em. I said that this wa s surel y not the intent ion of the ir patron in helping them to settle on land of the ir own. A Jew repli ed to m e in Ger man: \"Is it not written : The sons of the al ien shall be your plough men and vinedr essers?\" I kno w tha t such delinquenc ies have beco me the excep tion in Je wish co loniza tion of Palestine, but the y are symptomatic of dangers which will have to be guarded against. 811 The fellah in may, however , consider themselves luck y to be al lowed to liv e at all, for, according to several passages in the Cabal a, all the goyim are to be swept of f the face of the earth when Israel comes into its own. Thus the Zohar rel ates tha t the Messiah will declare war on the whole world and all the kings of the world will end by declar ing war"},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"on the Messiah. But \"the Holy One, blessed be He, will displa y His force and exter minate them from the world.\" 812 Then: Happ y will be the lot of Israel, whom the Hol y One, blessed be He, has chosen from amongst the goyim of w hom the Scrip tures sa y: \"The ir work is but vanit y, it is an il lusion at which we m ust laugh ; they will all per ish w hen God visits them in His w rath.\" At the moment when th e Hol y One, blessed be He, will exter minate all the goyim of the world, Israel alone will subsist, even as i t is written : \"The Lord alone will appear grea t on tha t day.\" 813 The hope of world-do mination is therefore not an ide a attributed to the Jews by \"anti- Semites,\" but a ver y real and essentia l part of their tradit ions. What then of the ir attitude to Christiani ty in the past? We have alread y seen that hatred of the person and t eaching of Christ did not end at Golgotha, but was kept al ive by the Rabbis and perpe tuated in th e Talmud and the Toledot Yeshu. The Cabal a also cont ains passages referring both to Christ and to Moham med so unspeakab ly foul th at it would be i mpossibl e to quote the m here. But it will be ur ged: the Jew s of Western Europe to-da y know nothing of the Caba la. This may be so, y et impercep tibly the Caba la has m oulded the mind of the Jew . As a mo dern Jewish writer has dec lared: [Kabbal ism] has contribu ted to the for mation of mod ern Judaism , for, without the influence of the Kabbal a, Judaism to-day might have been one-sided, la cking in warm th and imagination. Indeed, so deepl y has it pene trated into the bod y of the faith that many ideas and pra yers are now immovabl y rooted in the gener al body of orthodox doctrin e and practic e. This el ement has not onl y becom e incorporat ed, but i t has fixed its hold on the affections of the Jews and cannot be eradi cated. 814 It is thus not in the law of Mo ses thunder ed fro m Sinai, not in the dr y ritual of the Talmud, but in the stupendous i maginings of th e Cabal a, tha t the real drea ms and aspira tions of Jewr y have been transm itted through the ages. Belief in the coming Messiah m ay burn low , but fai th in th e final triumph of Israel over the other nations of th e world stil l glows in the hearts of a race nurtured on this hope from time immemorial. Even the free- thinking Jew must unconsciousl y react to the pro mptings of this vast and ancient ambition. As a m odern French writer has expres sed it: Assuredl y sectari an Freeth inkers swarm, who flatt er the mselves on having borro wed nothing from the synagogu e and on hat ing equa lly Jehovah and Je sus. But the modern Jewish world is itself also deta ched fro m any supernatura l beli ef, and th e Mes sianic tradition, of which it preserves the cu lt, reduc es itself to considering the Jewish race as the verit able Messiah 815 . Some colour is len t to th is state ment by an artic le which recent ly appear ed in the Jewish press, in which i t is expla ined that, ac cording to the t eaching of the \"L iberal Jewish Synagogue,\" the beaut iful passages in the fift y-third chapter of Isaiah concern ing \"the Man of Sorrow s acqu ainted with grief,\" usuall y supposed b y Christians to rela te to the"},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"promised Messiah, are int erpreted to m odern Jewish y outh as relat ing to Israel and signif ying that Israel's \" sufferings were caused b y the sins of other nations,\" who thus \"escaped the suffering they deserved.\" Consequen tly \"Israel has su ffered for the sake of the whole world 816 .\" How this a mazing pretension can be m aintained in view of the perpe tual denuncia tions of the Israelites throughout th e whole of the Old Testament is difficult to imagine. On their entr y into Cana an the y were distinc tly told by Moses tha t the Lord the ir God had not given them \"this good land\" on account of their righteousness or the uprightness of the ir hearts 817 ; long afterwards Danie l declared that a ll Israel had transgressed the law of God 818 ; Nehem iah showed tha t on accoun t of the ir rebe llion and disobedi ence they had been deliv ered in to the hands of their ene mies 819 . Isaiah spoke of the iniqui ties of Judah in burning word s: Ah sinful nat ion, a peop le lad en with in iquity, a seed of evi ldoers, chi ldren tha t are corruptors!... Wash y our, make you clean ; put away the evi l of y our doings fro m before Mine eyes; cease to do evil ; learn to do wel l, etc. 820 Thus even the Word of G od itself is powerless to m itigate the immense m egalomania of the Jewish rac e. It is doubtful inde ed whether by the m ajorit y of Je ws the Bible is no w regard ed as divine ly inspired. \"The ten commandments which we gave to m ankind 821 \" is a phrase t ypical of the manner in which Israel now arrogat es to itse lf the sole authorship of the Scriptures. The deific ation of hum anity by the Freemasons of the Grand Orient finds its counterpar t in the deifi cation of Israel by the m odern Jew. It is here tha t we mus t surel y see the cause of mu ch of the suffering the Jews have endured in the past. No one of course would ju stify the crue lty with which the y have frequen tly been treated; neverthe less to m aintain there was no provoca tion on th e part of the Jews would be absurd. A race that has alwa ys considered itse lf ent itled to occup y a privileged position a mongst the nations of the world must inev itably meet with resent ment, and in a prim itive age or populat ion resent ment is apt to find a vent in violence shocking to the civilized mind. Moreover , to represen t the Jews as a gentl e long- suffering peopl e, alwa ys the victims but never the perpetra tors of violenc e, is absolute ly contr ary to histor ic fac t. In the dark ages of the past the Jews sho wed th emselves perfe ctly capabl e of cruel ties not only towards other races but towards ea ch othe r. One of the first pogro ms recorded in the Christian era was carried out b y the Jews the mselves. The Jewish histor ian Josephus de scribes the reign of \"lawlessness and barbari ty\" that was inaugur ated about the middle of the first centur y A.D. b y the band of assassins kno wn as the Sicari i, who infested the countr y round Jeru salem and, b y means of li ttle daggers tha t they wore concea led bene ath th eir gar ments, \"slew m en in the daytime and in the m idst of the city, especia lly at the festivals when they mixed with the multitude.\" During one night raid on the s mall town of Engaddi they massacr ed more than seven hundred w omen and children. 822 And Josephus goes on to sa y: Somehow , indeed, tha t was a ti me most fertil e in a ll manner of wicked practi ces among the Jews, inso much that no kind of vill ainy was then left undone; nor could anyone so much as devise an y bad thing th at was new if he wished. So deepl y were the y all infected, both privat ely and public ly, and vi ed with one another who should run the"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"greatest leng ths in i mpiety towards G od, and in unj ust ac tions towards the ir neighbours, men in power oppressing the multitude, and the m ultitude earn estly ende avouring to destro y men in power . 823 It is futile then to maintain as do the Jew s and their friends--for the pro-Jew is frequent ly plus royaliste que le roi --that all the faults of the modern Jew are to be at tributed to bitterness engender ed by persecut ion. Judaism has alwa ys contained an el ement of cruelty 824 which finds expression in the Talmud. It is fro m the Talmud, not from the Mosaic l aw, that the inhu man methods of Je wish slaugh tering are derived. 825 The Talmud likewise gives the most horribl e dire ctions for carr ying out capita l punish ment, particularly with regard to women, by the m ethods of stoning, burning, choking, or slaying with the sword. The vi ctim conde mned to be burnt is to have a scarf wound round his neck, the two ends pull ed tigh tly by the execu tioners whilst his mo uth is forced open with pincers and a lighted string thrust into it \"so that i t flows do wn through his inwards and shrinks his entr ails.\" 826 It will be said that all this belongs to the past. True, th e pract ice here described may be consider ed obsolete, but the spirit of crue lty and intol erance that dicta ted it is stil l alive. One has onl y to study the m odern Jewish pre ss to rea lize the persecution to which Jews are subjected from members of the ir own race should th ey infringe one frac tion of the Jewish code. If, then, \"the m odern Jew is the product of the Talmud,\" it is here tha t we mus t see th e princ ipal obstacle to Jewish progres s. It is said that Isaac Disrael i, the father of Lord Beaconsfield, gave as his reason for withdrawing from the Synagogue that Rabbini cal Judais m with its un yielding l aws and fetter ing custo ms \"cuts off the Jew s from the grea t family of ma nkind.\" 827 Such a s ystem is inde ed absolute ly incompatible not onl y with Christi an teaching but with the secular ideas of Western civi lization. The at titude it adopts towards wom en would be in itself sufficient to ju stify this assertion. The Jewish dail y prayer, \"Blessed be Thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, tha t Thou has not m ade me a wom an!\" 828 is a ludicrous anachronis m in the present age. According to the Talmud a service can take place in the Synagogue only if ten persons are present, which num ber ensures the presence of God in the assem bly. Drach explains however that these persons must all be me n. \"If then there were nine men and a million wom en there could be no assem bly, for the reason that women are noth ing. But ther e arriv es [on the scene] only one small boy of th irteen years and a day, at once there can be a hol y assem bly and, according to our D octors, it is per mitted to God to be present 829 .\" When therefore we sa y that we must respect the Jewish religion we cannot, if we know anything about it, m ean tha t we respect that portion of i t which is founded on the Rabbin ical tradi tions of the Talmud and the Caba la, but only that ethical law set forth in the Old Testament, to which right-liv ing Jew s have faithfu lly adhered and which is largely in accord with Christian teach ing.

It is here tha t we cannot fail to dete ct the origin of mu ch of tha t virul ent an ti-Christ ian teaching that is being dissem inated in our m idst to-da y. This t eaching will be ob served to follow three l ines, of which the course has been tr aced throughout this book.

The first two theor ies are, as we have seen, those held b y secret societ ies; the last is essenti ally Jewish. It is true tha t ther e is now a movement amongst the more enlight ened Jews to recogniz e Jesu s as a great t eacher ; so far, unfortunate ly, this is me t by bitter hostili ty from the rest, and in the current Jewish press conte mptuous and even blasphe mous refer ences to Christ and the Christian faith frequen tly occu r. The fact that here in Engl and, for near ly three hundred y ears, the Jews have been al lowed to dwel l in pea ce and carry out th eir rel igious rit es unm olested, that they have been admitted to societ y, to m asoni c lodges, and to all offices of Stat e and have met with increasing toleran ce and favour , has done nothing to m odera te that ha tred of Christi anity incul cated throughout nineteen centur ies of Rabbini cal teach ing. Thus, for example, under the heading of \"Wha t Christi anity has Meant,\" we read in a m odern Jewish periodi cal: We are thinking of w hat Christian ity as an institut ion has m eant to us Jews. The twent y centuries of i ts existenc e have been coeva l with th e long-drawn trag edy of the Jew's dispersal among the nations.... What kindl iness and considera tion we have receiv ed at the hands of Christi anity has for the m ost part been tendered with the lure of the baptis mal font. To the exten t to which Christiani ty's embodiment, the Church, has been puissant has the Jewish tr agedy deep ened. Onl y when and where the Church has been weak has life been tolerab le for the Jew .... Hatred of the Jew, anti- Jewish outbursts and an ti-Semitic campaigns, are trace able to nothing so surel y as to antip athy to the Jew which has been inbred by Christian ity.... There is thus prec ious lit tle about which th e Jew has for rejoicing and gladness in the insti tution of Christian ity, etc. 831 The most cursor y study of histor y would reve al the falseness of this con tention. Antipa thy to the Jew began long before the Christian era; in Egypt, Persia, and Rom e he beca me, whether just or not, the object of suspicion to rulers. The reason given b y Pharaoh for oppressing the Israelites wa s that if they were a llowed to grow too powerful they might join the mselves to th e ene my in time of war 832 ; the Emperors of Ro me regarded them as a turbul ent element; Mohammed dec lared: \"Their aim will be to abet disorder on the earth, but God love th not the abet tors of disorder .\" 833 Meanwhil e, the antipa thy shown by the \"peopl e\" in ever y countr y was mainly based on econom ic grounds. It was not sim ply the posses sion of w ealth--which according to the Socialist creed should justify any amount of hatred--but th e manner in which i t was acquired and the arrogance with which it was displa yed that roused popular feeling against the Jew s.

Why will they not work with their hands ?... pract ising usur y is not working. It is explo iting others whilst remaining id le.\" 835 Such quotat ions as these m ight be m ultiplied ad infinitum .

Let us consider what Christiani ty has in rea lity done for the Jews. If so mu ch is to be said about the persecu tions the y have endured, what of the extraordin ary indulgen ce shown them as the result of Christi an respect for the Bible? F or hundreds of y ears Christ ian school children have been brought up on Old Testament histor y and Christian congreg ations have listen ed sympathetically to the story of Israel's sufferings and hopes of fina l restora tion. All the support lent to Zionis m arose fro m this tradi tion. Christ ianity, then, so reviled by the Jews, ha s been their greatest protec tion. If Christ ianity goes, the whole theor y that the Jews were once the Chosen People goes with it as far as Gentiles are concerned, and the Jewish race, divested of its halo of divine favour , will have to be judged on its own m erits. In our own countr y, the Chosen People theor y has in fact been carri ed to the point of superstit ion--a supersti tion i mmensel y advantag eous to the Jews--which consists in interpret ing the passage of Scripture contain ing the prom ise m ade to Abraham , \"I wil l bless the m that bless thee, and curse the m that curseth thee,\" as m eaning th at favour shown to the Jews--w ho for m merely a frac tion of the seed of Abraha m--brings with i t peculiar blessings. In reali ty it would be easier to sho w by histor y that countries and rulers who have protect ed the Jews have frequen tly met with disaster . France banished the Jews in 1394 and again in 1615, and did not readmit them in large nu mbers t ill 1715- 19, so that they were absent throughout the m ost glorious period in French histor y--the Grand Siècl e of Louis XIV--whilst the ir return coincid ed with the Regenc y, from which moment the m onarch y of France m ay be said to have dec lined. England likewise banished the Jews in 1290, and it was during the thre e and a half cen turies the y remained in exile that she was known as \" Merr ie Engl and.\" The fact tha t their return in force in 1664 was followed th e next year by the Great Plague and the year after by the Great Fire of London would not appear to indic ate that the Jews necessaril y bring good fortune to the land th at prote cts the m.

I would ur ge, then, that the Jewish proble m should be approach ed nei ther in the spirit of superstit ious pro-Sem itism nor in the bit ter spiri t of \"anti- Semitism,\" but with a sanit y worth y of an enlight ened age. To quot e again the words of Bernard La zare, let us enquir e what part \"the Jew, consider ing his spirit, his charac ter, the natur e of his philosoph y and his rel igion,\" may now be taking \"in revolu tionar y processes and mo vements.\" Is there, then, any eviden ce that ther e exists a mongst Jewr y to-da y an or ganized conspira cy having for its objects world-domination and the destruct ion of Christi anity such as the fa mous Protocols of the Elders of Zion suggest ? 836 The theor y of a Jewish world-conspirac y does not, of course, rest on the evid ence of Protocols.

But th e arguments of the Jews and their friends go further than this; not only do the y claim that there is no Je wish conspira cy, but no w orld-plot of an y kind. This content ion the y had indeed maintained from the beginning, and Mr . Luci en Wolf, in his ear liest \"refutat ion\" of the Protocols, derided the exponents of the secret-socie ty danger as vehe mently as he derided th e perfidious author of the Jewish Peri l. It wil l in fact alwa ys be noticed that references to the Il luminati meet with al most as m uch resent ment from the Jewish press as allusions of a direct ly \"anti- Semitic\" charact er. Barrue l, who refused to incr iminate the Jews, and de Malet, who never referred to the m at all, are denounced b y Mr. Lucien Wolf no l ess as scare mongers than Gougenot des Mous seaux or Chabaut y. To suggest tha t any Hidden Hand has ever been at work in the world is to raise i mmediately a stor m of Jewish protest. Yet intel ligent Jew s must be well aware that, whether secre t societ ies have contribut ed as much to past revo lutions as these writers beli eved, th eir exist ence and their very real influence is not a m atter of surmise but of histor ical fact. No one ever warned the British publi c more distinc tly of the danger th ey presented or of the role the Jews were pla ying in them than Disraeli, whose fa mous words have been quoted so frequent ly in this connex ion: \"The world is governed b y very different personages from what is i magined by those who are not behind the scenes.\" What is this but a clear recogni tion of the Hidden Hand? Why, then, is Disrael i not included with Barruel, Robison, de Malet, and Des Mou sseaux in Mr. Wolf's list of scaremongers? Is it because Disrael i point ed the moral that, Jew s being so dangerous, the y should be employed? If, then, leading Jew s persist in vill ifying everyone who reit erates the warnings utt ered b y so eminent a member of their race, it is inev itable tha t they should come to be suspected of having some interest in suppressing further revela tions. Setting al l such eviden ce as the Protocols co mpletely aside, let us exa mine the reasons for believing in the exisence of a Jewish w orld-conspiracy. Now , we know for certain that the five power s before referred to--Grand Orient Masonr y, Theosoph y, Pan-Ger manism, Intern ational Financ e, and Soci al Revolu tion--have a ver y real ex istence and exerc ise a very definit e influen ce on th e affairs of the world. Here we are not deal ing with hypothesis but with fac ts based on docum entary evidence. We know in ea ch case th e names of ma ny of the leaders, their methods of or ganiz ation, their centres of dir ection, and the ai ms they are pursuing. But with regard to the Jewish power we canno t proceed with the sa me certa inty. We canno t cite the names of the leaders or the cen tres of direction, we cannot produce docu mentary evidence as to their methods of organization or the ir fina l aims. The ver y exist ence of such a power, in the sense of a united and organiz ed bod y of Jew s working for th e destruct ion of Christi anity and the existing social system, is still a ma tter of specul ation and not of known fact. Investigat ions into the activities of such groups as the B'nai B'rith, Poale Zion, the Jewish Bund, and the Weltverband (or Jewish Interna tional Union of Social ists), m ight however throw m uch light on this question.

Thus Je ws have long played a leading part in Grand Orient Masonr y 837 and predom inate in the upper degre es. As we have alre ady seen, Free masonr y is alwa ys said to be subversive in Ro man Cathol ic countr ies. It wil l also be noticed that in countri es where Free masonr y is subversive, Jews are usually less conspicuous in the revolu tionar y movement than in countr ies where Freemasonr y is either non-existen t or consti tutiona l. Thus in France the m asonic peri l is much more gener ally recogniz ed than the Jewish peril ; in Italy the Free masons have been banned by Mussolini, but the Jews are not regarded by him as a part icular danger; in Portugal it was the Freem asons rather than the Jews who ma de the rec ent revolu tions. In Hungar y, however , the revolu tionar ies were princ ipally both Jews and Freem asons. On the other hand, in England, Germ any, and America, where Freemasonr y is not subversive, the Jewish quest ion is m ore apparent. All th is would suggest that either Freem asonr y is the cover under which the Jews, like the Illu minati, prefer to work, so that where the cover is not avai lable they are oblig ed to co me out more into the open, or that Grand Orient Masonry is the direc ting power which employs Jews a s agen ts in those countries where i t cannot work on its own account. The preponderanc e of Jew s in the ranks of \"Aurora\" has alre ady been indica ted, as also the influen ce of the Jewish Caba la in the t eaching of Theosoph y and Rosicruci anism. But it is import ant that th e latter point should be furth er emphasi zed in connexion with the craze for occu ltism that is spread ing through society. Ragon has said: \"The Cabala is the key of all occu lt sciences\"; therefore in this fie ld of exper iment the Gentile must alwa ys be at a disadvan tage with the Jew. Indeed Mr. Waite, who cer tainly cannot be su spected of \"ant i-Semitism,\" goes so far as to suggest that th e gift of cere monial magic was \"the answer of Jewr y to Christendo m as a counter -blast\" to \"cen turies of per secution.\" 838 It would be well if ever y Gentil e who has been te mpted to dabble in occu ltism were to realize this source of inspir ation. The rôle of Jews in social revolut ion and part icularly in Bolshevism hardl y needs comment. Yet since the Jewish press has chosen to den y this last and very obvious fact and still persists in setting down to prejudic e or \"ant i-Semitism\" a mere state ment of facts, it m ay be well to quote here a few official state ments on the subject which admit of no deni al. First of al l, it must be remember ed tha t the founder and patron saint of Bolshevis m was the Jew Karl Marx, and that it was the Anarchist Bakunin, not th e Duke of Northu mber land, who described him and his following in the Intern ationale as \"the German- Jew Co mpan y\" and the \"red bureaucr acy.\" It was ther efore not surprising that when the \"red bureaucr acy,\" avowedl y founded on the doctrines of Marx, cam e to be set up in Russia, it should have been lar gely led by Jews.

To quote again an of ficial docu ment on th is question, the Report on Revolu tionar y Activ ities issued by a Com mittee of the New York L egislatur e, headed by Senator Lusk 841 : There was no o rganized oppo sition to Bela Kun. Like Lenin, he surrounded hi mself with commissars, having absolut e author ity. Of the thirty-two princip al commissars, twent y- five were Jew s, which was about the sa me proportion as in Russia. The most prominent of these form ed a director ate of five: Bela Kun, Bela Varga, Joseph Pogan y, Sigmund Kunfi, and one other . Other lead ers were Alpari and Sa muely, who had char ge of the Red Terror, and carried out the torturing and execu ting of th e bour geoisie, especia lly the groups held as hostages, the so-cal led count er-revolution ists and peasants. 842 The same Report publishes a l ist of sevent y-six me n prosecuted by the Co mmittee on the charge of cri minal anarch y in America at the beg inning of 1920, of which the overwhel ming m ajority are seen b y their names to be Je wish. 843 These names speak for the mselves and are published without co mment on the obvious nationality of th e majorit y of the persons concerned. So far indeed does the Lusk Committee appe ar to have been removed fro m \"anti- Semitism,\" that nowhere in i ts vast Report, running to 2008 pages, is atten tion drawn to the preponder ance of Je ws concerned in the revolu tionar y movement, excep t in the one passage on H ungar y quot ed above. The Lusk Report must therefor e be regard ed as an absolut ely impartial state ment of fac ts. In view of these of ficial dat a, how is it possible for the Jewish press to pretend that a connex ion between Jews and Bolshevis m is a m alicious invention of the \"anti-Se mites\"? That all Jew s are not Bolsheviks and that all Bolshev iks are not Jews is of course obvious; but that Jews are playing a preponderat ing part in Bolshevis m it is absurd to deny. An att empt has been m ade to show that Jews have suf fered as m uch as the rest of the popula tion in Rus sia under Bolshevis m and that the Jewish relig ion has m et with the same hostility as the Christian faith. Doubtl ess many Jews have suffered in Rus sia, since human violen ce, once allowed to go unchecked, is liab le to express itself in various unexpe cted ways, and th e resent ment of th e Rus sian \"prolet ariat\" towards the Jews wa s bound to break out under Lenin as under the Tzar. Again, a ca mpaign against Christiani ty inevitably led in Rus sia, as in France, to a ca mpaign against all for ms of re ligion, and the Jewish Bolsheviks, being atheists them selves, were doubtless as read y as La mbert of the French Revolution to turn aga inst the believers in the faith they had abandoned."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Yet that th e Jewish religion suffered to the same extent as Christ ianity, or tha t any organiz ed ca mpaign was conduc ted aga inst it by the Govern ment, is ef fectually disproved by the lamentations of professing Je ws on the death of Lenin. 844 Indeed, as is genera lly recogn ized, the fal l of the Soviet Govern ment must mean the downfall of the Jew s from the position of privileg e they now occup y. That in our own countr y Jews are pl aying a part in the background of Bolshevism is aga in evident. The Patriot recent ly published a series of art icles giving inside infor mation on the organiza tion of th e revolut ionar y mov ement in Great Brita in, where it was stated the whole plot was direct ed by a group of twe lve m en.

Incidenta lly, it is curious to notic e that the language employed in som e of the correspondence that has passed between members of an inner group bears a strong resem blance to that of Weishaupt and his fellow- Illuminati. Jewish influen ce in the less extre me forms of Socialism in this coun try is no less appar ent. If the Labour Party is solidl y pro-G erman, it is also solidl y pro-Je wish. Whilst loudl y procla iming pacifis m and pressing for the reduction of arm aments, it has never uttered a word of protest against the e mployment of Brit ish troops to defend Jewish interests against the Arabs in Palestin e. The blessed word Mesopota mia may be freel y mentioned in connexion with the withdrawal of troops from military adventur es, but never the word Palestin e. Again, the free admission of aliens and particu larly of Je ws into this countr y has alwa ys been one of the principa l planks in the Labour platfor m. Even the Jewish capi talist meets with indulg ence at the hands of our S ocialist Intel lectuals, who whilst inveighing against British owners of propert y, never inc lude Jewish m illionaires in their dia tribes. This may perhaps throw som e light on the question frequentl y propounded: How can one believe that Jews advocat e Socia lism since they stand to lose ever ything by it? The fact remains tha t many Jews do advocat e it. After the recen t accession of the L abour Part y to office the Jewish W orld observed: The result of the General Elec tion in England is regarded as very gratif ying by the Hebrew and Yiddish press. The Hebrew journals in Palest ine, as well as the Hebrew and Yiddish or gans in Europe and Americ a, express satisfac tion at the return to Parl iament of men who have repea tedly assured the publi c of their inten tion to adhere to the Balfour declaration. 847 A further reason is advanc ed by the Jewish Courier for rejoicing at the downfall of the Conservat ive Govern ment, namely, that \"th e election results have wiped out ant i-Semitic remnants in Eng land,\" for \"the Conservativ e Governm ent does include several members who are far from favourabl y disposed towards Je ws.\" 848 The indulgenc e sho wn to the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"Jews and the honours piled on the m by Conservative states men therefor e avai led nothing to the Conservat ive cause, and the welfare of the whole countr y was subordinat ed to th e interests of the Jews alone.

Indeed, we find the same Jewish paper which rejoiced at the adven t of the present Governm ent to of fice offering bir thday congra tulations to th e richest Jew in this countr y, whose wealth, it goes on to observe with som e complacen cy, \"amoun ts to no less than £12,000,000 sterling, and is constant ly incre asing, apart from the inter est that it brings, b y the huge profi ts of the conc erns in which he is interest ed.\" 849 It would seem , then, that in the eyes of Je wry all capitalists are not to be regard ed as monsters who should be m ercilessly expropria ted. But in considering the war on Capi talism it is essential to bear in m ind that capit alists are of two kinds: nationa l industri al cap italists--lar gely Genti les and usuall y men of brains and energy who have buil t up flourishing businesses--and in ternat ional loan-m ongering capitalists, princip ally, though not exclusive ly, Jews, w ho liv e by specula tion. Whilst to the form er, social unrest may prove fatal, to the latter any disturban ces m ay provide opportuni ties for profit. As M. Geo rges Bat ault has well expressed i t: From the strict ly finan cial point of view , the most disastrous events of histor y, wars or revolu tions, never represent ca tastrophes; the m anipulators of mo ney and the war y business me n can make profit out of ever ything, provided they know beforehand and are well- informed.... It is cert ain that th e Jew s dispersed over all the surface of the ear th ... are particu larly favourabl y situated in this respect. 850 It is significan t to not ice that the capi talists mos t attacked by the Soci alists and Pacifists are not those who m ake profit out of war s and revolutions, but those who contribu te to the prosperit y of th e countr y and provide work for m illions of peop le. Here, th en, the Jews and the Socia lists see m to find a point of agre ement. It is evid ent, at an y rate, tha t many rich Jews consider tha t they have nothing to fear from the threat ened Capi tal Levy and other featur es of expropria tion. Are we not irresistib ly reminded of the passage in the Protocols- -where inciden tally the Capita l Lev y is specific ally mentioned--\"Ours the y will not touch, because the m oment of atta ck will be known to us and we shall t ake m easur es to protect our o wn\"? But let us consider further how the Socialist plan for \"the nation alization of all the m eans of product ion, distribu tion, and exchange\" might be reconc iled even with the int erests of Jewish Industrial Capita lists. The more we exa mine this ma gic formula which is to transfor m the world in to a Paradise for the workers, the more we shall see that it approxi mates to the system of Super Capit alism, of w hich, as Werner Somb art has shown, the Jew s were the princ ipal inaugurators. Socialists are fond of expla ining th at \"Capi talism\" began with the introduct ion of stea m; in reali ty, of course, Cap italism, in the"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"sense of wealth accu mulated in private hands, has alwa ys existed since the first savage made his store of winter food. What Socialists rea lly mean by Capitalism is the modern system of Indu strialism, which tends to concentra te all th e means of production and distribu tion in the hand s of ind ividua ls or group s, who, if the y happen to be unscrupulous, are able by systematic sweating of th e worker and ble eding of the consu mer to conduct operat ions on s o large a scal e as to crush al l competition b y the home worker or the s mall trad esman. Obviousl y, however , with the growing demand of the workers for better condit ions of life and the incre asing support len t to th em by enlighten ed publi c opinion this pos sibility canno t cont inue indef initely, and unless a violen t convulsion takes pla ce the time will come when great industria l magnates will have to content themselves with m oderate profits on their outla y. Thus al though at first sight it might appear that the Super - Capitalist must desire to m aintain the existing order of things, if he is far -seeing he m ust realize that profite ering under present condi tions m ust soon cease. It is therefore conceiv able that even the Jewish Industria l Capi talist may see in the nationalization of industr y a preferabl e alternat ive to the l imitation of profits under priva te enterprise. The same finan cial acumen and skil l in m anagement which has enabled hi m to contro l rings and trusts in the past would ensure hi m a place at the head of nationalized industries, which in effect would be nothing but gigant ic trusts no minally under State con trol but reall y, like all State enterprises, in the hands of a few me n. Under Socia lism the position of these trusts would be rendered i mpregnabl e. For w hilst under the present s ystem any individu al or group m ay set out to break a trust, no such competition would be possible in a State where private enterprise had been made illegal. The men in control of nationa lized industries would therefore be able to exerc ise absolute author ity both over the worker and the consu mer. Further , if the worker can be persuaded to accept the ultimate schem e of Co mmunism, which is com pulsor y labour in return for no m onetary remunerat ion, but merely a dail y ration of food and the other necessari es of life whenever State officials decide that he requires the m, the directors of Labour , like the overseers in a slave pl antation, will be abl e, as in Russia, to impose an y condi tions the y please. The Jews m ay well hope to occup y these posts, not only because of their aptitud e for organiz ation on so lar ge a scal e, but because the ir internation al relat ions w ould facil itate the sale or bart er of goods between countries. The cohesion which exists am ongst the m would speedi ly lead to the monopoli zation of all the higher posts b y members of their race. It is idle to dism iss such a pos sibility as a chi mera. This is w hat happened in Rus sia and is happen ing in Ger many to-da y. Here, then, we m ay find perhaps th e inner meaning of a remark attributed to a prom inent member of the Labour Part y, that under Social ism a certain well-known Jewish capita list might well be worth £10,000 a year. Lenin expressed m uch the same idea when he said tha t the Russian Soviet Republ ic might requir e a thousand first-class specia lists \"to direct the work of the people,\" and that \"these"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"greatest 'stars' must be paid 25,000 roubles each,\" or even four ti mes tha t sum , suppo sing it were necessar y to employ foreign speci alists for the purpose. 851 But the Jewish capit alists doubtless see further that in England, as in Rus sia, this condi tion of things would be m erely a temporar y phase, and tha t the institut ion of Socia lism by dispo ssessing the present Gentil e owners of wealth and propert y would pave the wa y for a Jewish and Ger man plutocr acy. In Russia weal th has not been altogeth er destro yed; it has simply changed hands, and a cl ass of new rich has sprung up which meets with no ho stility from the professed advocat es of equali ty. Those Jews w ho see in the Christ ian Inte lligentsia the m ain obstac le to their dream of world-power , therefore natur ally find in the pro moters of class-warfare the ir most valuable allies. For the Christian Intel ligentsi a is the sole bare to the enslav ement of the proletar iat; most of the movements to redress the wrongs of the workers, fro m Lord Shaftesbur y's onwards, have arisen not amongst the workers the mselves, but amongst the upper or m iddle classes 852 ; once these were swept awa y an iron bureaucra cy would have the workers at their mercy. I do not say this is the plan, but I do sa y that such a h ypothesis provides a reason for th e otherwise unaccountab le indu lgence displa yed by Socialists everywhere towards weal thy Jews and at the same time for th e huge funds the Socialists appe ar to have at the ir disposal. If big financi ers are not at the ir back, I repeat: where does all the mon ey come from? It seems unl ikely that it can be derived from the British owners of wealth and propert y whom the Social ists are openl y out to dispo ssess; the onl y body of financi ers w hich can therefore be suspect ed of contribu ting towards this end is the body known as \"Intern ational Financ e,\" which is m ainly, though not exclusivel y, Jewish. The influenc e of the Jews in al l the five grea t powers at work in th e world--Grand Orient Masonr y, Theosoph y, Pan-Ger manism, Interna tional Finance, and Socia l Revolu tion--is not a ma tter of sur mise but of fact. Let us now exa mine what part the y are pla ying in the minor subversive m ovements enu merated in an earlier chapt er. Freud, the inventor of the m ost dangerous form of Ps ycho-Analysis, is a Jew . In this connex ion the eminent Amer ican neuro-ps ychiatrist before quoted writes: Not onl y the Freud theor y of psycho-analysis but a considerabl e quant ity of pseudo- scien tific propaganda of that type has for y ears been emanating from a group of Ger man Jews w ho liv e and have their headquart ers in Vienna. Fro m its incept ion, ps ycho-anal ysis has been in Jewish hands. There are not half a dozen ph ysicians in the whole world, recogn ized as authorit ies in th is field, whose na mes are iden tified with th is mo vement who are not Jews. This m ay have been an acc ident, but neverth eless it is a fact. 853 I have alread y referred in an ear lier chapter to the question of degener ate art defin ed in a circular to the New Y ork He rald as \"the deif ication of ugl iness.\" 854 The originators of this cult are here described as a group of Satan worshippers in Paris, and the dea lers b y whom the movement was propagat ed as \"Germ ans,\" but we note amongst the lenders to the"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"exhib ition at which these \"works of art\" were displa yed several Jewish na mes. Of one well- known J ewish art ist a cri tic has w ritten: Were these work s the product of a man who had i mperfect control over his m aterial, who, in stumb ling towards the ligh t, dwelt inevit ably upon mu ch darkness, who s ought for beauty and found ugl iness, w ho looked for purit y and found filth- -even then one m ight be silent and hope for better things to come. But here, apparen tly, unless m y whole read ing is ludi crousl y wrong, he del ights in defor mity and glories in degradat ion....

Whatsoever th ings are hideous, whatsoever things are of evil report, whatsoever things are sordid: if there be an y unheal thiness or an y degrad ation: think on these th ings. What bett er résu mé could be given of tha t tenden cy to perversion denounced by the prophet Isaiah in the words: \"W oe unto the m that call evil good, and good evi l; that put darkness for ligh t, and l ight for darkness\"? An organ of the Jewish pres s, with that sense of solidar ity which alwa ys rallies Jew s to the defen ce of the ir compatriots however culpable, immediately detects in the cr itic's expression of opin ion the insidious work of \"anti-Semitism.\" A more enlight ened Jew , Mr. Frank L. Emanuel, however , having come to the support of the Gentile critic, the Jewish j ournal is obliged to adm it the justice of his contention that \"it is la mentable to think of the undue proportion of y oung Jew s\" who \"have joined the Revolu tionar y or sham 'Modern Art' mo vement in this countr y.\" The same influ ence will be noticed in the cinema world, where, as has alre ady been point ed out, histor y is systematically falsif ied in the int erests of class hatr ed, and everything th at can tend, whilst keeping within the present law , to under mine patr iotism or morality is pres sed upon the publi c. And the cinema trad e is al most entir ely in the hands of the Jews. In the drug traf fic Jews are playing a prom inent part both here and in America. An eminent New York doctor writes to me as follows: Members of th e Federal narcot ic squad at tached to the Treasur y Depart ment and hav ing the function of enforcing the provisions of the Harrison Act have long been convinced that ther e is a dire ct relationship between Radica lism and narcotis m. From seven to t en years ago this was thought to be a m anifestat ion of pan-Ger man propaganda. Activ ity was and still is greater on the part of the distr ibutors and pedl ars than is to be accoun ted for b y the large profits, according to the ir stor y. Curiousl y enough, the traffic largely stopped for severa l weeks following the signing of th e Armistice. In one instance, seven regularl y licensed ph ysicians of the \"East Side,\" all Jews, were arrest ed in succession during the su mmer of 1920 for ill egitimate use of narco tic prescrip tions, and ever y office raided had large quant ities of Radica l literature. Such associa tions are not uncom mon."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"As to the distribution, a recen t invest igation b y Hearst 's Magazine defin itely revea led th e fact that the illeg itimate distribu tors were al most invariab ly of the Jewish rac e, and th at the pedlars were exclusivel y Jewish and Ital ian. Enough, then, has been said to show that, whether as agents or as princ ipals, Jews are playing a par t in al l subversive m ovements. A Christi an Jew , no renegade to his race but deeply concern ed for the ir future develop ment, said recent ly to the present writ er: \"The growing m aterialism amongst Jews ha s made the m the most destruct ive force in the world. The only hope for the m is to ac cept Christian ity. At present th ey are the great est danger that Christian civil ization has to face.\" The recognit ion of al l these facts does not of course imply the bel ief tha t all Jew s are destruc tive. Undoubted ly there are good and lo yal Jews--parti cularly in France, where the Sephardi m predo minate--who have absolute ly identified the mselves with the countr y of their adopt ion, and are sincerel y opposed to Bolshevis m. But these isolated individu als carry little weight co mpared to the m assed forces of subversive Jewry. The same thing was observed in America, where a report privat ely communicated to the present writer in 1923 stat ed: It appears not withou t signific ance that Radica l literatur e is never anti- Semitic, but, on the contrar y, manifestoes issued b y the Ex ecutiv e Committee of the Com munist Party are often emphatically pro-J ewish. So far as I know , there is not one exc lusivel y Jewish organiz ation in the United Sta tes which is openl y and consistent ly fight ing Radi calism. Conservat ive Judais m loyal to the Unit ed States and its insti tutions as conc eived by its founders is unor ganiz ed and inar ticulate. When, therefore, the Jewish press protests at the injustice of associa ting Jews with Bolshevis m it may be leg itimately answered: What has Jewr y done col lectively to disassocia te itse lf fro m Bolshevism? 855 What of ficial protests has the Jewish press uttered against an y subversive mov ement excep t when Jewish interests were threat ened? 856 Has it not, on the contr ary, denounced all patrio tic efforts to oppose the forces of destruction whenever such efforts necessita ted the exposure of the corrupt el ements in Jewr y? But these tac tics have not been confined to the Jewish press alone. The genera l press of this countr y, over which the Jews exercise an incre asing control, has followed th e sam e policy. This process of pene tration began long ago on the Continent. As earl y as 1846 an English m issionar y to the Jews in Berlin wrote: Independ ently of the fift een exc lusivel y Jewish journals of Ger many, four of w hich have made their appear ance since the beginning of the present year, the daily polit ical press of Europe is ver y much under the dom inion of the Jew s; as liter ary contr ibutors, the y influence almost every leading Contin ental newspaper , and as controvers y seems to be their nat ive ai r, and the y bring into the field m ental energies of no ordinar y stamp, they find no lack of e mployment, and if an y literary opponent ventur es to endeavour to arrest the progres s of Judais m to poli tical power , he finds hims elf he ld up to publ ic noti ce, and exposed to attack aft er att ack in most of the leading journals of Europe. Such ... was the"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"lot of a Ro man Cathol ic priest of Prague, who late ly wrote a pam phlet entitled Guter Rath für Zeit der Noth , direct ed aga inst the advancing power of Judais m. And such is m y convi ction of the ext ent of the part icipation the Jew s take in the ever yday literature of Germany, that I never pass b y a crowded read ing-roo m, but what I think I see standing behind the scenes a Jew , causing new ideas to rise and stir , and develop themselves in the unsuspecting mind of th e Gentil e. 857 Do we not see the same methods being pursued with still greater vigour to- day? It would not be an exagger ation to sa y that there is hardl y a periodic al in this countr y with the exception of The Patriot that dares to speak out freel y on que stions in which the inter ests of Jews are involved. The fact is that the whole educ ational as well as the whole politi cal and social world is permeated with Jewish influen ce. Ever y man in public life, every modern polit ician, to whatev er part y he belongs, see ms to find it de rigueur to have his confident ial Jewish adviser at his elbow , just as in th e Middle Ages a prince had his Jewish doctor alwa ys at hand to m ix his potions and ensure hi m long lif e. This appe ars to be owing not only to the utility of the Jew in fin ancing projects, but to the almost universal belief in the superior intelligence of the Jewish race which the Jew has succeed ed in i mplanting in the Genti le mind. But the ti me has co me to ask: Is the Jew reall y the super -man we have been taugh t to consider him? On exa mination we shall find tha t in th e present as in the past his talen ts are displa yed principa lly along two lines- -financi al and occult. Usurers in the Middle Ages, financ iers to-da y, the Jews have alwa ys exce lled in the making and m anipu lating of wealth. And ju st as at the form er period they were the grea t masters of ma gic, so at the present time they are the masters of the almost magical art of gaining control over the mind both of the individu al and of the publi c. Yet in the rea lms of li terature, phi losoph y, paint ing, sculpture, polit ics, and even science, Jews will be found frequen tly occup ying th e second or third ranks, and onl y very seldom the first. Heine may be cited as a poet of th e first order , Spinoza as a philosopher , Disrael i as a sta tesman, but it would be dif ficult to prolong the l ist. On the stage and in m usic alone can the Jew s be said to have proved absolute ly the equals of the ir Genti le competitors. The fact is that the Jew is not usuall y a man of vast concep tions, nor is he endowed with great original ity of mi nd; his s kill consists rather in elaborat ing or in adapting oth er men's ideas and rendering them more effectual. Thus the most impor tant inven tions of m odern times have not been m ade by Jews, but have been frequen tly improv ed by them. Neither James Watt, Steph enson, Marconi, Edison, Pasteur, nor Mada me Curie were of the Jewish race, and the same might be said of nearl y all the greatest m en who have liv ed since the dawn of our civi lization. Napoleon was not a Jew , nor was Shakespeare, nor Bacon, nor Sir Isaac Newton, nor Micha el Angelo, nor Leon ardo da Vinci, nor Galileo, nor Dante, nor Descartes, nor M olière, nor E merson, nor Abraha m Linco ln, nor Goethe, nor K ant, nor even Machi avelli. Thrown on their own resources, what civil ization were the Jew s able to create? Whilst Egypt, Greec e, and"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Rome have lef t immortal monuments, what m onuments has Palest ine beque athed to the world ? 858 The Jews, then, provide a high average of clevern ess, but have the y ever during the last two thousand years produced one m ighty genius? Moreover , against this high average of intelligence must be set an equal ly high average of me ntal derange ment. On this point we have the evid ence of the Jewish Encyc lopædia : The Jews are more sub ject to diseases of th e nervous s ystem than the other races and peopl es am ong which they dwell. Hysteria and neurasthenia appear to be m ost frequent. Some physicians of lar ge experien ce among Jews have even gone so far as to state th at most of the m are neurasthen ic and hysterical. Tobler cl aims th at all the Jewish wo men in Palest ine are hysterical; and Ra ymond says that in Warsaw , Poland, h ysteria is ver y frequen tly met with among both Jewish m en and Jewish w omen. The Jewish populat ion of tha t city alone is almost exclusive ly the inexhaust ible source for the suppl y of hysterical males for the cl inics of the whole Contin ent ( L'Etude des Maladies du Système Nerveux en Russie ). As regards Austria and Ger many, the sa me neuroti c tain t of the Jews has been emphasiz ed by Kraf ft, Ebbing, etc.... In Ne w York it has been shown b y Collins that among 333 cases of neurastheni a which ca me under his ob serva tion, more than 40 per cent, were of Jewish extra ction, etc. 859 The same Amer ican neuro-ps ychiatrist alr eady quoted attributes the predo minance of Jews in the revo lutionar y movement in America lar gely to this cause: Anarchists have been deve loped largely from the cr iminal classes, and a beli ef in anar chy, per se , is a psychopathic manifest ation. A student of anarch y, therefore, would not onl y be obliged to cover the field of cri minolog y, but its m ore significan t and importan t background, psycho-patholog y. Som e anarch ists are ac tually insane, while others show marked ps ychologic al deficien cies. Under our laws as the y are now fra med, they canno t be restrained unless the y commit acts of viol ence. As it is, our as ylums are fil led with this class, and tha t introdu ces another phase of the matter. Our as ylum insane are largely recru ited from the Jewish rac e, at least recruited in tremendous disproportion to the ir number in the population. The fact that the revolu tionar y movement is so lar gely made up of Je wish el ements furnishes an interesting confir mation of w hat I have said. The Jewish W orld , recently commenting on the \"genera lly admitted\" fac t that \"the percentage of me ntal disorders a mong Jews is m uch greater than a mong non-Jew s,\" asks: \"Is the cause inheren t, that is to sa y, is there a racial disposition towards degenerac y, or is it the result of the externa l condi tions and causes?\" The writer goes on to refer to an article in the Zukunft which supports the view that the terribl e experi ences of the Jews in the Middle Ages have affected the ir nervous s ystem, and th erefore that th e cause of mental derange ment amongst the m \"is not due to racia l disposition, is not an ethnic princ iple, but is the result of the tragi c lot of the Jewish people.\" 860 It might perhaps be traced m ore surel y to the habi t of brooding on tha t trag ic lot. At an y rate, it is curious to"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":"notice that the two s ymptoms recogn ized in the first stages of \"genera l paral ysis of the insane,\" the m ania that one is the object of per secution and \"exal ted ide as\" (kno wn in France as the folie des grandeurs ), are the two obse ssions tha t the Talmud and th e Cabal a with their dream s of world-do mination under an avenging Messiah have incu lcated in the mind of the Jew. But whatever are the causes of this neurosis, it is surel y undesirable that a race which exhib its it should be al lowed to contro l the destinies of the Brit ish E mpire or indeed of any countr y. If \"al l the Jewish wo men in Palestin e are hysterical,\" presum ably many of their menkind suf fer from the same disabi lity, which cer tainly does not pro mise well for the luckl ess Arab who is to live beneath their sway. How mu ch of the trouble that has occurr ed alre ady in Pal estine may be attribu ted to this cause i t is impossible to know . The increasing nu mber of Jew s in positions of authori ty in Eng land presents, however , a far greater subject for al arm. Jews and Arabs are a t any rate both Se mites and may be expected to have cer tain ideas in common, but to pla ce a highl y civilized Aryan race under Sem itic contro l is another matter. The ti me has co me for ever y Briton to ask himself whether he seriousl y desires to see the tr aditions of his countr y, those great traditions of honour , integri ty, and justice which have made the na me of England great, replaced by Oriental standards. I do not sa y that there are no honourab le and upright Jews, but I do ma intain that the spirit of fair pl ay which is the essence of the British character is not the charac teristic of the Jewish rac e in general. The complete absence of this spirit shown in the attempts of agit ators to suppress free speech during ele ctions canno t be at tribut ed to English working-m en--whose \"sporting\" instinct is highl y developed--and testifi es to the alien charac ter of th e so-call ed Labour movement. If England loses the spirit of fair play, she will have lost her m ost pricel ess national heritage. Conservat ism, which has alwa ys stood for th ese great tradi tions, allows itse lf to be hypnotized b y the memory of Disraeli and acc epts his dictu m that \"the natural tenden cy of the Jews is to Conservat ism\"--henc e the advisabil ity of pl acing Jews in contro l of its interests. The l ate Mr. Hyndman saw further when he warned us tha t \"those who are accustom ed to look upon al l Jew s as essenti ally practi cal and conservat ive, as cer tain, too, to enlist on the side of the preva iling social system, will be obliged to reconsider their conc lusions.\" 861 The causes of the rec ent débâcle of the Conservative Governm ent are still obscure, but the fact remains that i t was precisel y at a moment when Conservat ive or ganization had passed lar gely into Jewish hands tha t Conservatis m met with the m ost astound ing disaster in the whole of its histor y. If the m anner in which Conservat ive propagand a was conducted at this mo ment was an exa mple of Jewish efficiency, it might be well to consider whether on a future occasion the task should not be confided in to the hands of simp le Bri tons. The only effectual way of combating Socia lism is to show up the ali en influences behind it . As long as the working m an believes it to be the outco me of a genuin e Brit ish labour movement, he will turn a deaf ear to all warnings and anti- Socialist propaganda will merely serve to drive more recrui ts into the Socia list ca mp.

The Secret Service has overwhel ming ev idence on this last point, which under a Conservativ e Governm ent might have been m ade publi c, but unseen influences in high pla ces have ordained i ts suppression. The slogan \"Bri tain for the Britons,\" that would form the strongest count erblast to the false slogans of Social ism, has been barred fro m Conserva tive platforms and th e very word \"ali en\" avoided lest it should of fend Jewish su sceptibilities.

The grea t weight of Je wry will never be thrown into the scale of true Conservat ism; only in so far as Conservatis m abandons i ts patrio tic tradit ions and co mpro mises with the forces of Interna tionalism will it win an y considerab le Jewish support. We have but to follow the commitments on curren t poli tics in the Jewish pres s in order to rea lize that the only standard b y which the Jews j udge of an y political party is the measure in which it will confer exclusiv e advan tages on the ir own race.

For if, as we have seen b y docum entary evidence, this plan has always existed in the past, is it likely that it has been abandoned at the ver y moment which seem s most propi tious for its reali zation? The tr end of present events and the tone of th e Jewish pres s certainly do not warrant an y such conc lusion. To sum up, then, I do not think that the Jew s can be proved to provide the sole cause of world-unrest. In order to establ ish this cont ention we s hould be obliged to show the Jew s to have been the authors of ever y past socia l convulsion in the histor y of mo dern civilization, to discover their influenc e behind the here tical sects of Islam, as behind the Bavar ian Il luminati and the Anarchists of Rus sia.

A Jew na med Morel, referring to the persecution of the conver ted Rabbi Drach b y the Jews, observes: What can the wisest m easures of th e authori ties of all coun tries do aga inst the vast and permanent conspiracy of a peopl e which, like a network as vast as it is strong, stretched over the whole globe, brings its force to bear wherev er an even t occurs tha t interests the name of Israeli te? 863 It is this solidari ty that consti tutes the real Jewish Peril and at the sa me time provides the real cause of \"anti-Se mitism.\" If in a world where all pa triotism, all nation al traditions, and all Christ ian vir tues are be ing systematically destro yed by the doc trines of Intern ational Socia lism one race alone, a race th at since time immemorial has cherished the dream of w orld-power, is not onl y allowed but encouraged to consolida te itself, to maintain all its nat ional tradi tions, and to fulfil all its nation al aspira tions at the expense of other races, it is eviden t that Christian civilization must be even tually obliterated. The wave of an ti-Jewish feel ing tha t during the last few years has been passing over this countr y has nothing in common with the racia l hatred that inspires the \"anti- Semitism\" of Germany; it is sim ply the answer to a pre tension tha t liberty-loving Britons wil l not admit. Those of us who, sacrific ing popular ity and mo netar y gain, dare to speak out on this question have no hatred in our hearts, but only love for our countr y. We beli eve th at not only our nation al securi ty but our great na tional tradi tions are at stake, and that unless England awakens in time she will pass under al ien do mination and her influence as the stronghold of Christian civil ization will be lost to the world. CONCLUSION We have now followed the course of as sociations working throughou t ninet een cen turies to underm ine social and mo ral order and above all Christian civil ization. We have also seen th at although on the one hand the unhol y spirit of destruct ion and on the other the natur al spiri t of revol t against oppres sion have alwa ys existed indep endent ly of an y organiz ation, it is to secret societies using and or ganizing these forces that the revolu tionar y movement has owed its success. Further , we have considered the possibil ity that behind both open and secret subversive societies there m ay exist a hidden cen tre of direction, and final ly we have observed that at the present t ime many lines of invest igation revea l a connex ion betwe en these group s and th e Grand Orient, or rather with an invisibl e circ le conceal ed behind that great m asonic power . At the same time this circle is clear ly not French in chara cter since ever ywhere the ac tivities of World Revolu tion are direc ted aga inst France and England but seldo m against Germ any and never against the Jew s. It would not be an exaggerat ion to say that no subversive"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"movement in the world to-da y is either pro-French, pro-British, or \"ant i-Semitic.\" We must conclude then tha t if one Po wer con trols the rest it is either the Pan-Ger man Power, the Jewish Power or what we can only call Illuminism. This last h ypothesis is one that deserves serious con sideration. In the light of our pre sent knowledge it does not appear i mpossible tha t if an inner c ircle of World Revolution exists it consists of a purel y Internat ional group of me n whose ai m is that of Weishaup t--the destruc tion of th e present system of society. That such an aim can be seriousl y enterta ined is shown b y the fac t that it is openl y procl aimed by a whole school of w riters and think ers ranging from gentle Idea lists to ferocious Anarchists who, whilst widel y differing as to methods and the ultimate ends to be at tained, are agreed on the common purpose expressed b y Rabaud de Saint- Étienne in the words: \"Ever ything, yes, ever ything m ust be destro yed, since ever ything m ust be re-m ade.\" It is idle to sa y that so insane a project can present no danger to the world; the fact remains tha t an incr easing nu mber of people regard it with perfe ct equan imity. The phrase: \"All civilizations have passed awa y; ours will doubtless pass a way likewise,\" is continually to be heard on the lips of apparen tly sane men and women who, whether they advoc ate such an eventua lity or not, see m prepared to accep t it in a spiri t of co mplete fatalism and to put up no resistance. The point they ignore is that when civil ization existed onl y in isolated spots on the ear th's surface it might pass awa y in one s pot only to spring to life in another , but now that civilization is world-wide the drea m of a re turn to natur e and the joys of savager y conjured up b y Rousseau and Weishaupt can never be realized. Yet if civ ilization in a m aterial sense canno t be destro yed, it is none the l ess possible to take the soul out of it, to reduce i t to a dead and hear tless m achine without human feelings or divine aspirations. The Bolsheviks continu e to exist a midst tel ephones, electric ligh t, and other a menities of mo dern l ife, but they have almost killed the soul of Russia. In this sense then civilization may pass awa y, not as the civi lizations of th e ancient world passed away, leaving onl y desert sand s and crum bling ruins behind them , but vanishing i mpercept ibly from benea th the outward structure of our existing institutions. Here is the fina l goal of world revolut ion. If, then, one inner circl e exists, co mposed of Illu minati animated by a purel y destructiv e purpose it is conceiv able that they might find support in those Ger mans who desire to disint egrate the countries of th e Allies with a view to future conquests, and in those Je ws who hope to establish the ir empire on th e ruins of Christian civilization- -hence th e superb organiz ation and the immense financ ial resources at the disposal of the world revolu tionar ies. On the other hand it may be that the hidden centre of direct ion consists in a circle of Jew s located in the background of the Grand Orient, or perhaps, lik e the early nineteenth-centur y Illuminati, loca ted nowhere but working in ac cord and using both Pan-Ger mans and Gentile Illuminati as their tools. On this point I think it would be dangerous at present to dog matize. But tha t the proble m is cap able of elucid ation I have no doubt whatever. If the Secre t Services of the world had chosen to co-ordinat e and m ake publi c the facts in their possession the whole plot m ight long since have been la id bare. A \"Depart ment for th e Investiga tion of Subversive"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Move ments\" should have had a place in ever y ordered govern ment. This m ight have been created by the recen t Conservat ive Govern ment in England, but the sa me mysterious influence that protect ed the enem y during the Great War has throughou t prevent ed disclosures th at would have enligh tened the countr y on the rea l natur e of the peril confront ing it. In the present state of European politi cs the onl y course open to those w ho would save c ivilization is to act indep endent ly of govern ments, and for m a counter - organiz ation in each countr y with unof ficial bureaux of inform ation m aintaining re lations with each othe r, yet each re taining its nat ional charac ter. As far as this countr y is concerned I am convin ced tha t only a great nationa l movement can save us from destruct ion--a m ovement in which m en of all classes and above all of the working-class will take part. Fascism o triumphed in Ital y, because it was not, as it has been absurdl y represent ed, a rea ctionar y movement, but because i t was es sentially democratic and progre ssive, because b y appe aling to the noblest instin cts in hum an natur e, to pa triotism and self- sacrifice, it rallied all elements in a disor ganized and disunit ed nat ion around the standard of a common cause. One canno t bring about any great movement without first kindling a sacred fire in the hearts of me n; one cannot move masses of peopl e merely by appea ling to self-int erest; they must have a cause to fight for , a cause tha t is not en tirely their own. S ocialism, whilst enlisting a large proportion of i ts following b y appe aling to the ir baser instin cts, has never theless, b y its false idea ls and pro mises, been able to kindle a fire in m any generous hear ts, and to persuade deluded enthusiasts tha t they are working for the welfare of hu manity. The onl y way to combat Social ism is to cre ate counter enthusiasm for a true ideal. Yet even Mu ssolin i found that a purel y secular ideal was not enough, and tha t the spirit of religious fervour was necessar y to defeat the spiri t of m aterialism and destruction. For behind the concr ete forces of revolut ion--whether Pan-Germ an, Judaic, or Illu minist-- beyond that inv isible secret c ircle which perhaps dire cts the m all, is there not y et another force, still more poten t, that must be taken into ac count? In looking back over the centuries at the dark episodes that have m arked the histor y of the hum an rac e from its earliest origins--strange and horrible cults, waves of witchcr aft, blasphem ies, and desecra tions--how is it possible to ignore the exist ence of an Occult Power a t work in the world ? Indiv iduals, sects, or races fired with the desire of world-dom ination, have provided the figh ting forces of destruction, but behind them are the veritab le powers of darkness in e ternal confli ct with the powers of light. APPENDIX I"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"JEW ISH E VIDENCE ON THE TALM UD The denuncia tion of the Talmud by the Jew Pfef ferkorn in 1509 and the ex-Rabbi Drach in 1844 have been quoted in the course of this book. G raetz however , in his History of the Jews , quotes an earli er inc ident of this kind. 864 In the th irteen th cen tury a conver ted Jew and for mer Talmudist Donin who, on his bapt ism, assum ed the name of Nicholas, present ed himself before th e Pope, Gregor y IX, \"and brought char ges aga inst the Talmud, saying that i t distort ed the words of Hol y Writ, and in the Agadic portions of it there were to be found disgraceful representa tions of God,\" that it contained many gross errors and absurdit ies, further that \"it was fill ed with abuse against th e founder of the Christian religion and the Virgin. Donin de monstr ated that it was the Talmud which preven ted the Jews from accep ting Christiani ty, and that withou t it they would cer tainly have abandon ed their state of unbelief.\" Again \"he stated that the Talmudical writings taugh t it was a m eritorious ac tion to kill the best man among the Christ ians 865 ... that it was lawful to deceive a Christi an without any scruple; that it was per mitted to Jew s to break a promise made on oath.\" These Graetz describ es as l ying char ges. The Jews were accord ingly ordered b y the Pope to hand over all th eir copi es of the Talmud to the Dom inicans and Franciscans for exa mination, and if the ir judgment should corrobora te the charges of Nichol as Donin, they were to burn the volu mes of the Talmud (June 9, 1239). In France Graetz goes on to relat e that \"the priest-ridden and weak-m inded Louis IX\"-- that is to say, Saint Louis- -pursued the sa me course. \"The Talmud was put on its tri al. Four distingu ished Rabbis of North France were com manded b y the King to hold a public disputa tion with Nicholas, ei ther to refute the imputations leve lled against th e Talmud, or to make confession of the abuse aga inst Christi anity and the blasphem ies against God that it conta ined.\" It is im possible to imagine a fairer dec ision, and the queen- mother, Blanche de Castil le, was careful to assure the first witness sum moned that if the lives of the Rabbis were in danger she would protect them and that he was onl y required to answer the questions that would be asked of him . Now , there would have been nothing si mpler than for the Rabb is to admit honestl y that these offensive passages existed, that they had been written perhaps in moments of pas sion in a less enl ightened age, tha t they recogniz ed the indelicacy of insult ing the relig ion of the countr y in which they lived, and that therefore such passages should hencefor th be del eted. But instead of adopting this straigh tforward course, which might have put an end for ever to att acks on the book the y held sacred, the Rabbis proceeded to den y the existenc e of the \"alleg ed blasphe mous and im moral expressions\" and to declar e that \"the odious facts rela ted in the Talmud concern ing a Jesus, the son of Pantheras, had no reference to Jesu s of Nazar eth, but to one of a similar name who had lived long before him.\" Graet z, who adm its that this was an error and tha t the passages in question did rela te to the Jesu s of th e Christians, represents the Rabbis as being merely \"misled\" on the question. But th e King, who wa s not misled by the Rabbis, ordered all copies of the Talmud to be burnt, and in June 1242 these were co mmitted to the flames. 866"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"The Talmud, however , continued to exist, and it was not until 1640 that, as we have already seen, the of fending passages aga inst Christ were expunged b y the Rabbis as a measur e of expedi ency.

As far as I a m aware the y are not included in any Engl ish translat ion of the Talmud, but may be found in an Engl ish version of Dr . Gustav H. Dalman's book, Jesus Christus im T almud (1891). II THE \"PROT OCOLS\" OF THE ELDERS OF ZION Contrar y to the assertions of cert ain writers, I have never affirmed my belief in th e authenticity of the Protocols, but have a lways treat ed it as an entir ely open question. 867 The only opinion to which I have committed myself is that, whether genuine or not, the Protocols do represent the progra mme of world revolu tion, and that in view of the ir prophet ic nature and of their ex traordinar y resem blance to the protoco ls of cert ain secre t socie ties in the past, they were ei ther th e work of s ome such societ y or of s omeon e profoundl y versed in the lore of secre t societ ies who wa s able to reproduce the ir ide as and phra seology. The so-called refuta tion of the Protocols which appeared in the Times of August 1922, tends to confir m this opinion. According to these artic les the Protoco ls were lar gely copied fro m the book of Maurice Joly, Dialogues aux Enf ers ent re Machiave l et Montesqui eu , published in 1864. Le t it be said at once tha t the resem blance be tween the two works could not be accid ental, not onl y are whole paragr aphs al most ident ical, but the various points in the progra mme follow each other in precisel y the sa me order . But whether Nilus copied from Joly or from the same sou rce whence Jol y derived his ideas is anoth er question. It will be notic ed tha t Joly in his prefa ce never claimed to have origin ated the sche me described in his book; on the contrar y he distin ctly states tha t it \"personifi es in part icular a poli tical system which has not varied for a single day in its application since the disastrous and alas! too far -off date of its enthron ement.\" Could th is refer only to th e govern ment of Napoleon III, established twelve years earli er? Or m ight it not be taken to signif y a Machi avellian system of governm ent of which Napoleon III was su spected by Joly at this m oment of be ing the exponent? We have alread y seen that this system is said b y M. de Mazères, in his book De Machiave l et de l'influence de sa doctrin e sur les opinions, les moeurs et la pol itique de la France pendant la Révo lution , published in 1816, to have been inaugurated by the French Revolut ion, and to have been carried on b y Napoleon I against whom he brings precise ly the same accusa tions of Machi avellism that Joly brings aga inst Napoleon III. \"The author of The Prince ,\" he writes, \"was alwa ys his guide,\" and he goes on to describe the \"parrot cries plac ed in th e mouths of the peopl e,\" the \"hired writers, salar ied newspapers, m ercenar y poets and corrupt ministers em ployed to m islead our van ity methodic ally\"--all this being carried on by \"the scholars of Machiav elli under the orders of his clever est discip le.\" We have already traced th e course of these methods fro m the Illu minati onwards."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Now precisel y at the moment when Jol y published his Dialogues aux Enf ers the secre t socie ties were particu larly activ e, and since by this date a number of Je ws had pene trated into their ranks a whole crop of liter ary efforts direc ted against Jews and secret societies marked the decade. Eckert with his work on Freem asonr y in 1852 had given the incentive; Crét ineau Joly followed in 1859 with L'Eglise Romaine en fa ce de la Révolution , reproduc ing the docum ents of the Haute Vente Rom aine; in 1868 ca me the book of the Germ an ant i-Semite Goedsche, and in the following y ear on a higher plane the work of G ougenot Des Mous seaux, Le Juif, le Judaïsme, e t la Judaïsat ion des Peuples Chrétiens . Meanwhile in 1860 the Alliance Israëlite Universelle had arisen, having for its ult imate object \"the grea t work of hum anity, the annihil ation of error and fanaticism, the union of hum an society in a faithfu l and solid fraterni ty\"--a formu la singular ly reminiscent of Grand Orient phi losoph y; in 1864 Karl Marx obtained control of the two-y ear-old \"Intern ational Working Men' s Associat ion,\" b y which a num ber of secre t societ ies beca me absorbed, and in the same year Bakunin founded his Alliance Sociale Démocratique on the exa ct lines of Weishaupt's Illu minism, and in 1869 wrote his Polémique con tre les Juifs (or Etude sur les Juifs al lemands ) mainly direc ted aga inst the Jews of the Internationa le . The sixties of the last cen tury therefore m ark an impor tant era in the histor y of the secret socie ties, and it was right in the middle of this period that Mauric e Joly published his book. Now it will be re membered that amongst the sets of paral lels to the Protocols quoted b y me in World Revolution , two were t aken fro m the sources above quoted--the docum ents of the Haute Vente Ro maine and the progra mme of Bakunin' s secre t socie ty, the Alliance Sociale Démocratique . Meanwhile Mr. Lucien Wolf had found another parall el to the Protocols in Goedsche' s book. \"The Protocols,\" Mr . Wolf had no hesit ation in asserting, \"are, in short, an a mplified imitation of Goedsche's handiwork\" 868 and he went on to sho w that \"Nilus followed this pa mphlet very closel y.\" The Protocols were then dec lared by Mr. Wolf and his friends to have been completely and fina lly refuted. But alas for Mr . Wolfe's discernm ent! The Times articles came and abolished the whole of his car efully constructed theor y. They did not, however , demolish mi ne; on the contrar y, they supplied ano ther and a ver y curious link in the chain of evidenc e. For is it not remarkable that one of the sets of parall els quoted by me appear ed in the sa me year as Joly's book, and that within th e space of nin e years no less than four parall els to th e Protocols should have been discovered? Let us recap itulate the even ts of this decad e in the form of a t able and the proxi mity of dates will then be mo re appar ent: 1859.

It will be seen, then, tha t at the m oment when Maurice Jol y wrote his Dialogues , the ideas the y embod ied were current in ma ny different circles. It is inter esting, m oreov er, to notice that the authors of the last two works referred to above, the Cathol ic and Royalist Des Mou sseaux and the Anarch ist Bakunin, between who m it is impossibl e to imagine any connexion, both in the same year denounced the growing power of the Jews w hom Bakunin described as \"the m ost for midable sect\" in Europe, and again asserted that a leakage of inform ation had t aken pla ce in the secre t societ ies. Thus in 1870 Bakunin explains tha t his secret society has been broken up bec ause its secre ts have been given away, 869 and that his co lleagu e Netcha ïeff has arriv ed at the conc lusion that \"in order to found a serious and indestruct ible society one mus t take for a basis the polic y of Machi avelli.\" 870 Meanwhile Gougenot Des Mous seaux had rela ted in Le Juif , that in Dece mber 1865 he had receiv ed a le tter from a Ger man states man saying: Since the revo lutionar y recrudescen ce of 1848, I have had rela tions with a Jew who, fro m vanity, betrayed the secret of the secre t societ ies with which he had been associated, and who warned m e eight or ten da ys beforehand of all the revolu tions which were about to break out at any point of Europe. I owe to hi m the unshake able convict ion tha t all these movements of \"oppressed peopl es,\" etc., etc., are devised b y half a dozen individu als, who give their orders to the secre t societ ies of al l Europe. The ground is absolute ly mined beneath our fee t, and th e Jew s provide a large contingen t of these miners.... 871 These words were writt en in th e year after the Dialogues aux Enf ers were published. It is further i mpor tant to noti ce tha t Joly's work is dat ed fro m Geneva, the m eeting-place for al l the revolut ionaries of Europe, inc luding Bakunin, who wa s ther e in the same year, and where the first Congres s of the Internationa le led by Karl Marx was held two y ears later. Alread y the revolu tionar y camp was divid ed into warring fact ions, and the rivalr y betwe en Marx and Mazzin i had been superseded b y the struggle betwe en Marx and Bakunin. And all these m en were m embers of secret societies. It is b y no m eans improb able then tha t Joly, himself a revolution ary, should during his sta y in Geneva have come into touch with the m embers of som e secre t organiz ation, who m ay have be trayed to him their own secret or those of a riva l organiza tion they had reason to su spect of working under the cover of revolution ary doctr ines for an ult erior end. Thus the protocols of a secret socie ty modelled on the lin es of the Il luminati or the Haute Vente Rom aine may have passed into his hands and been utilized b y him as an at tack on Napoleon who, owing to his kno wn connex ion with th e Carbonari, might have appe ared to Joly as the chief exponent of the Machiavellian art of duping the peopl e and using the m as the lever to power which the secre t societ ies had reduc ed to a system. This would explain Maurice Jol y's mysterious refer ence to the \"politi cal system which has not varied for a single da y in its appl ication since the disastrous and a las! too far -off date of its en throne ment.\" Moreover , it would expl ain the resem blance between al l the parallels to the Protoco ls from the writings of the Illuminati and Mirabe au's Projet de Révolution of 1789 onwards. For if the system had never varied, the code on which it was"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"founded must have re mained substan tially the same. Further , if it had never varied up to the time when Jol y wrote, wh y should it have varied since th at dat e? The rules of lawn tennis drawn up in 1880 would probabl y bear a strong rese mblance to those of 1920, and would also probabl y follow ea ch other in the same sequence. The dif feren ces would occur where modern improve ments had been added. Might not the same process of evolut ion have taken pl ace between the dates at which the works of J oly and Nilus were published? I do not agree with the opinion of th e Morning Post that \"the author of the Protoco ls mus t have had the Dialogues of Joly before hi m.\" It is possible, but not proven. Indeed, I find it difficult to imagine that anyone embarking on such an e laborat e impostur e should not have possessed the wit to avoid quoting passages verba tim--without even troubling to arrang e them in a different sequenc e--fro m a book which might at an y moment be produced as evid ence against hi m. For contrar y to the assertions of th e Times the Dialogues of Jol y is by no m eans a rare book, not onl y was it to be found at th e Brit ish M useum but at the London L ibrary and recent ly I was able to buy a copy for the m odest sum of 15 francs. There was ther efore ever y possibility of Nilus being suddenl y confronted with the source of his plagi arism. Furthe r, is it conceivabl e that a plag iarist so un skilfu l and so uni maginative would have been capable of improv ing on the origina l? For the Protoco ls are a vast i mprove ment on the Dialogues of Jol y. The most striking passages they conta in are not to be found in the earli er work, nor, which is mo re remarkable, are severa l of the amazing prophec ies concern ing the future which ti me has rea lized. It is this latter fact which presents the most insuperab le obstac le to the Times solution of the problem . To sum up then, the Protocols are ei ther a mere plag iarism of Maurice Joly's work, in which case the prophetic passages added by Nilus or another remain unexpla ined, or the y are a revised edition of the plan communicated to Joly in 1864, brought up to date and supple mented so as to suit modern conditions b y the continu ers of the plo t. Whether in this case the authors of the Protocols were Jews or w hether the Jewish portions have been interpol ated by the peopl e into whose hands the y fell is another question. Here we mus t admit the absence of an y direc t evid ence. An Internat ional circl e of world revolu tionar ies working on the lines of the Illuminati, of which the existenc e has already been indic ated, offers a perfect ly possible alternative to the \"Learned Elders of Zion.\" It would be easier , however to absolve th e Jew s from all suspicion of com plicity if they and the ir friends had adopted a more straigh tforward course fro m the ti me the Protocols appeared. When some years ago a work of th e sam e kind wa s directed against the Jesuits, contain ing what purported to be a \"Secret Plan\" of revolu tion close ly resembling th e Protocols, 872 the Jesuits indulg ed in no invect ives, m ade no appeal that the book should be burnt b y the co mmon hang man, resorted to no fantast ic exp lanations, but quietly pronounced the charge to be a fabric ation. Thus the m atter ended. But from the moment the Protoco ls were published th e Jew s and their fri ends had recourse to ever y tortuous me thod of defence, brought pressure to bear on the publishers- -succeeded, in fact, in tempor arily stopping the sales--appeal ed to the Hom e Secre tary to order their suppre ssion, conco cted one clin ching refutat ion after another , all"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"mutually exclusive of each other , so tha t by the time the solut ion now pronounced to be the correct one appear ed, we had alr eady been assured half a dozen ti mes that the Protocols had been co mpletely and finall y refuted.

Falk does not appear to have brought good fortune to the Goldsm id family, for Margoliou th in a passage which eviden tly relates to Falk sa ys that, according to Jewish legend, the suicide of Abraham Golds mid and his brother was attribut ed to the following cause : \"A Ba'al Shem, an opera tive Cabalist, in other words a thau maturgos and prophet, used to live with the fath er of the Goldsmids. O n his dea th-bed he summoned the patriarch Goldsmid, and del ivered into his hands a box, w hich he strict ly enjoined should not be opened t ill a tert ain per iod which the Ba'al She m specified, and in case of disobedi ence a torrent of fearful calamities would overwhel m the Golds mids. The patriarch's curiosit y was not aroused for som e time; but in a few y ears after the Ba'al Shem's death, Goldsmid, the aged, half sceptic, half cur ious, forced open th e fata l box, and then the Goldsmids began to learn what it was to disbel ieve the words of a Ba'al Shem.\"--Margoliouth, History of the Jews , II. 144. 484.

There is, however , the possibility that Lessing m ay have had in mind anoth er Falk living at the sa me period; this was \" John Freder ick Falk, born at Ha mbur g of Jewish paren ts, reported to have been head of a Cabalist ic Col lege in London and to have died about 1824\" ( Tranactions of the Jewish Historica l Society , VIII. 128). But in view of the part which the correspondence of Savalet te de Langes sho ws the Ba'al She m of London to have pla yed in the background of Free masonr y, it seems more probab le tha t he was the Falk in question. At an y rate, both were Jews and Cabal ists. 490. Who can this have been ? 491. The Duchesse de Gontau t relates in her Mémoi res that the Due d'Orléans was one day driving through the forest of Fonta ineble au when a m an, half c lothed and with a demented air, sprang towards the carriag e, gri macing horribl y. The Duke 's suite, taking him for a m adman, would have kept hi m at bay, but th e Duke, at that m oment awaking from sleep, unbutton ed his shirt and showed his assailan t an iron ring suspended round his neck. At this sight the m an took to his heels and disappe ared in to the wood. The mystery of this inc ident was never elucid ated, and the Duke, when quest ioned on the matter, would of fer no explan ation. Could this ring have been Falk' s talisman? 492.
